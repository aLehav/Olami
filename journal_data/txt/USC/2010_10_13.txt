After back-to-back losses, USC is looking to make some changes and get back on track this weekend against California. One of these changes involves the possibility of freshman wide receiver Robert Woods getting a chance to play on both sides of the ball.
Multi-talented · Freshman receiver Robert Woods, who had 12 catches for 224 yards and three touchdowns against Stanford and scored on a kickoff return against Minnesota, has been getting reps at defensive back in practice this week. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans seem to need some playmakers on defense, and that’s exactly where Woods fits the profile.  He plays on three different units and has scored a receiving and kickoff return touchdowns. He played both offense and defense in high school, and it looks as though the coaching staff is testing the possibility of that continuing throughout college — something Woods said he was glad to hear.
“I was pretty happy, smiling. It was one of my goals coming out of high school to play both ways,” Woods said.
Woods has been practicing with the defense since Tuesday, running one-on-ones and seven-on-sevens. USC coach Lane Kiffin has made it clear that he is taking this new idea with Woods very seriously, and plans to utilize his skills throughout his college career, not just this season.
“Here’s somebody who was a very great player on defense in high school as well and who we’re always going to look to for as many things as we can,” Kiffin said. “Especially with him being a freshman it’s going to continue down the road. We discussed before, with the probations and sanctions, the possibility of guys playing both ways, and he’s kind of the first guy that we’re looking at.”
As for Woods, he’s feeling good about his opportunity. Not only would he get the chance to make some key plays and grab some interceptions, but he said playing defensive back would help him in terms of his offensive ability as well.
Woods has gotten a lot thrown at him in a week by the coaching staff, but everyone seems excited about the possible change.
“They only gave me one task this week: to play my man and get the ball,” Woods said.
Now that USC has tested Woods as a player who can work on both sides of the ball, the only question that remains is whether or not he will be used defensively against Cal.
—
After the loss to Stanford, when the Trojans were defeated on the last play for the second week in a row, both critics and fans have questioned if the team could stay motivated.
The last time USC has been in this situation was back in 2001. Kiffin, however, said he was happy with the attitude at Wednesday’s practice.
“It’s been great,” he said. “I don’t think you can tell from them whether we won or lost the game. It’s not any different to me, and it’s not any different in practice. It’s just the same as the week before. I’m not worried about that — we just need to show up to play on Saturday.”
However, USC is concerned about injuries. Many players did not practice or were limited at Wednesday’s practice, but Kiffin is trying to look past that and just play who he can.
“We’ll take anybody that can play. We’re not going to rest somebody right now,” Kiffin said. “We can’t afford [to].”

Banksy, one of today’s most alluring and enigmatic artists, brings his creativity to a new outlet with the documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop.
The Ray Stark Family Theatre bustled with conversation Tuesday night as students prepared for Banksy’s directorial debut. The intimate, forest-green theatre was filled to the brim.
Among the attendants were Jaimie D’Cruz, the film’s producer, Chris King, one of the film’s editors, and surprise guest and promoter, Roger Gastman. The three guests had a question and answer session at the end of the film screening.
Banksy opens the documentary with the introduction of the star: Thierry Guetta, the crazy-but-lovable Frenchman with an unhealthy penchant for video recording — Guetta literally films everything.
Guetta’s filming obsession serves as the audience’s mechanism to peer into a unique art form, and as the vehicle to Guetta’s ultimate success, tracked slowly throughout the film.
Guetta incessantly chronicled the adventures of artists in France, England and Los Angeles with the intent of creating a documentary about street art.
In Exit Through the Gift Shop, Banksy includes a tease of what Guetta’s first rough cut, Life Remote Control, looked like, to give the audience an idea of Guetta’s filmmaking skills.  Guetta’s final product was a superfluous disaster, riddled with meaningless clips of nonsensical images and terrifying music that he believes to be self-proclaimed genius.
Banksy, the guerilla-artist-turned-director, turns the tables on Guetta. Banksy uses Guetta as a puppet-recorder to produce his own meaningful documentary on the mystifying, underground world that is street art, as well as the nature of artists themselves. Banksy tells his story through Guetta and his relationships with various urban art legends.
Interviewed under the concealing darkness of a hoodie and a disguised voice, the elusive Banksy maintains his anonymity, while explaining an art form that has been under the mainstream radar for decades, to the audience.
Banksy sifts through countless hours of Guetta’s footage to strategically compile a provocative collage of street art production. The film is rich with scenes of Guetta accompanying artists on their journey deep into the night to make their art; the scenes give the audience an accurate feel for the excitement and pressing legal issues behind the guerilla artistry.
Guetta often climbs to the tops of buildings, scaffoldings and other structures in order to capture the vantage point for his documentary. Luckily for Banksy, Guetta’s footage with legendary artists Space Invader, Mr. André, Shepard Fairey, Seizer, Neckface, Borf and Buffmonster is phenomenal.
Banksy has Welsh actor Rhys Ifans use a monotonous, omniscient voice to narrate Guetta’s journey throughout the street art world. The narration, in conjunction with artist interviews, provides the audience with a succinct storyline that is easy to follow but still enticing to watch.
However, the film is not just a conventional documentary about the thrilling conquests of guerilla artists. It also displays the transformation of Guetta himself from a neophyte filmmaker to a successful street artist.
Guetta, under the pseudonym Mr. Brainwash, helps propel the world of street art into the mainstream with the production of his first art show, “Life Is Beautiful”. Guetta sells out in an instant, and his success in the street art world is unprecedented.
Guetta’s complete metamorphosis, revealed at the end of the documentary, begs the audience to ask the question: Who is Banksy’s joke really on? Is there a moral to Banksy’s documentary?
After the screening was over, the panel of guests was beckoned to the front of the theater for discussion.
King informed the audience that the film started as a conventional street art documentary; however, with Guetta’s quirky filming habits and characteristics, the crew soon realized this was impossible. What evolved from the hours of Guetta’s tape was the intriguing story about the crazy Frenchman himself.
When the panelists was asked what they thought about the film, Gastman called it a comedy show in and of itself.”
The physical and personal idiosyncrasies of Guetta are so different and lovable that it is hard to watch the film and not laugh. Everything — from Guetta’s anachronistic facial hair and vocal tics — serves as comedic gold throughout the film.
D’Cruz elaborated by noting that there was a dichotomy between people’s reactions to Guetta’s success as a street artist: Some people were excited for him, saying that he did well and was living the American Dream; others, however, were furious, saying that Guetta had “manufactured” art by copying the legends he had filmed and gotten away with a terrible heist.
Whichever way one decides to look at it, one thing is for certain: the success of Mr. Brainwash is all thanks to one person, Guetta himself.  Gastman pointed out that if it were not for the way Guetta looked and acted, the results would not have been the same.
The panel led an intriguing discussion that was highlighted by interesting news: Mr. Brainwash has an art show in New York.
Whomever Exit Through The Gift Shop’s joke is on, both Mr. Brainwash and Banksy seem to be confidently moving forward with their work. As a film, Exit Through the Gift Shop successfully captures the mystifying world of street art on tape, and also supplies the viewer with food for thought. Thanks, Banksy.

USC has established a Research Collaboration Fund, allowing scholars from different disciplines to collaborate in a wide range of projects.
“Most other universities are more prescriptive — they dictate what will be done. This is more of a ‘grounds up’ approach: individuals come up with best ideas and we support the best ones,” said Randolph Hall, vice president of research.
Although other universities have interdisciplinary research, USC is unique in having a program where faculty-submitted proposals compete for funding, Hall said.
“We let anyone from the faculty apply for funding and choose the best ones,” he said.
Over the next three years, five research communities will receive funding for workshops, seminars and retreats. The individual research projects are funded through other means, while the Research Collaboration Fund provides a community to improve the quality of research.
After three years, communities can re-apply for continued funding.
The five proposals chosen were: game theory and human behavior, the USC Water Institute, digital humanities publishing, the political economy of the Pacific Rim and brain health during development and aging in urban environments.
Four other projects are receiving one-year seed grants.
The idea for the research fund started last fall in the academic senate, and the research office began asking for proposals in February. The funding comes from the general university research fund in the provost’s office.
The game theory and human behavior community, led by computer science professor Milind Tambe and psychology professor Richard John, will focus on applying game theory and other mathematical approaches like it to the social sciences.
The professors originally collaborated while working on a security system for airports that is currently used at the Los Angeles International Airport.
“As a computer scientist I have been trained to think about optimizing computer algorithms,” Tambe said. “It takes some time to understand the different priorities, but it is very interesting.”
The group has already had a research retreat for professors in the community, plans on having a game theory week in the spring with labs and open houses, and wants to introduce game theory and to K-12 classrooms, Tambe said.
Rong Yang, a second-year doctoral student studying computer science, said she enjoyed doing research in the community.
“In other research, it was just designing algorithms, and the way you verify the algorithms is with a computer simulation. It’s much easier because you can control all the parts,” Yang said.
Cinema professor Tara McPherson co-leads the digital humanities community. She said that her group hopes to help develop ways for scholars in the humanities to present their research in ways that integrate multimedia technology.
“Scholars spend a lot of time going through archives and analyzing them. Many archives are online. We can imagine a way that scholars can publish research in the archive and about the archive,” McPherson said. “[This] generation is very familiar with things like YouTube and Flickr. We like to imagine what would happen if a generation of scholars incorporated media like that into their research and publishing.”
She said that there are about 18 people in the community, and that they hope to help scholars publish works for the 21st century.
The communities are diverse, but all function as ways for faculty and students to share research across disciplines in a frictionless, natural way.
“I would like to see collaborative research that would not otherwise occur, that engages students and faculty in a creative way to address society’s biggest challenges,” Hall said.

A study conducted by a professor of gerontology and her team of researchers suggests women are more adept than men at understanding emotional cues under acute stress.
Professor Mara Mather, who is also the director of the Emotion and Cognition Lab at USC, published her study in the Oct. 6 edition of NeuroReport, which provided a biological explanation for the ways men and women differ in reacting to arguments. Women typically complain and seek emotional support in stressful situations, whereas men usually withdraw socially, Mather said.
“Our research is the first to indicate that sex differences in the effects of stress on social behavior directly correlate with a person’s ability to assess someone else’s facial expression,” Mather said.
When Mather’s research team began the project in fall of 2007, it sought to investigate the effects of stress on cognition, not necessarily the gender differences that emerge under stress, she said.
“It became apparent that stress has a different effect on the way men and women process social stimuli,” Mather said.
The research team simulated stress in study participants by placing their hands in cold water for 30- and 40-minute intervals then presenting them with various facial expressions.
Under acute stress, Mather said, men had less brain response to facial expressions. They most often struggled to identify fear and anger.
“The study revealed that, after stress, brain activation response to faces was enhanced in women but diminished in men,” said Nichole Lighthall, Mather’s research assistant and a doctoral student studying gerontology.
Students shared their thoughts on the differences between men and women during confrontation.
“I think men are more confrontational man-to-man but when it’s woman-to-man, I think the man is more submissive and doesn’t want the drama,” said Kevin Milkis, a freshman majoring in cinema-television production.
“Typically, women want to talk about things more and men are reserved and stay angry,” said Lauren Howard, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism.
The study’s findings are only pieces of fully understanding the behaviors of women and men, Lighthall said.
“It appears that understanding why men and women have different social and emotional responses to stress is a very complex research question,” Lighthall said. “This study makes an important contribution to answering it and hopefully our findings will be helpful in guiding future research on the topic.”

A recent Field Poll has shown that California’s Proposition 23 is losing support in the polls.
Proposition 23 would suspend the implementation of the Global Warming Solutions Act — AB 32 — until California unemployment is down to 5.5 percent.
The latest polls show 45 percent of voters oppose the proposition, with only 34 supporting it.
The proposition was introduced by Texas oil giants Valero and Tesoro, along with a refinery owned by billionaires Charles and David Koch. It would suspend the state law that requires greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to levels they were at in 1990 by the year 2020.
The proposition has found little support in California. Democrats are overwhelmingly against it and Republicans seem divided on the issue.
Though Republican Carly Fiorina has voiced her support for Proposition 23, Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman has said she opposes it, preferring a one-year moratorium instead of completely doing away with the clean energy bill.
“Climate change is going to get worse fast,” said Mark Bernstein, managing director of the USC Energy Institute. “[Students] are young enough to see that. If Prop 23 passes, in the near-term, there’ll be less opportunities for doing things that are green.”
Bernstein added that green technology is the only job industry currently expanding in the state.
“Where are the jobs going to be when you guys graduate? The only sector that is growing is green technologies,” Bernstein said. “That’s where the jobs are. And it’s only there because the government is putting it in place.”
Campus activist groups also oppose the proposition and protested at Valero gas stations across the state.
“Clean energy is our future,” said Ryan Waters, campaign coordinator of the No On Prop 23 CALPIRG chapter at USC. “We need to do everything we can to make sure California is a leader in clean energy and clean technology.”
Proponents of Proposition 23 say it will cost money to implement AB 32, which is set to start in 2012.
According to arguments made in favor of the proposition in the California Voter Guide, “AB 32 will cause California households to face higher prices both directly for electricity, natural gas and gasoline, and indirectly as businesses pass costs for [greenhouse gas] reduction on to consumers.”
But Bernstein said the long-term costs are nothing compared to the ultimate benefits of AB 32.
“Will it cost us? In the long-term, maybe,” Bernstein said. “But by the time we get out there, technology will improve and it probably won’t cost us anything. The benefits in the near-term significantly outweigh the costs.”
Micah Scheindlin, political director of USC College Democrats, agreed.
“Their arguments regarding revenue are wholly wrong,” Scheindlin said. “If anything, passing Proposition 23 would stunt the growth of California’s green tech economy and therefore cost the state revenue.”
The proposition’s opponents include The League of Women’s Voters and liberal college groups including California College Democrats.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger also opposes the proposition, having originally signed AB 32 into legislation in 2006.
“The effort to suspend AB 32 is the work of greedy oil companies who want to keep polluting in our state and making profits,” Schwarzenegger said after the measure qualified for the November ballot.
Two advocacy groups, the Courage Campaign and CREDO Action, have called for a boycott of Valero and Beacon gas stations in order to punish Valero for providing financial sponsorship of the initiative.
In the end, Bernstein said, students’ futures are in their hands.
“[AB 32] is not overcoming the jobless rate yet, but it’s getting there,” Bernstein said. “I really want the students to get out and vote.”
The voters in California continue to demonstrate that they are the most ignorant creature on earth!  The information used to pass ab32 and guide the CARB is bogus.  It amazes me that Califonians continue to support this policy when it kills jobs.  The notion of green jobs is a ruse… will not happen.  California loses.
What a bunch of dunderheads.  WHERE ARE ALL THESE “GREEN” JOBS????????  Hey, give me some of that KoolAid.
I can’t wait until Prop 23 fails.  All the people yipping about clean air are usually poor students and ex-hippies who will be hit the hardest by energy price increases.  As far as all the green jobs..yeah right, they will be created, IN CHINA.  You really think some company is going to produce solar panels in California’s business climate?  How long will that last without Government subsidies?  All this talk about “being the global leader in clean air and energy”is ideological crap.  THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE TO GET ON BOARD TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.  Good luck convincing China, the Soviet Union, and India to name a few to change.  A good business person knows how to pick his/her battles.  
The people of California never fail to amaze me.   We have had a Democratic controlled legislature  and 2 Democratic senators since the 90’s and look where we are. Some of the highest unemployment in the country, the highest or nearly the highest taxes in every category.  Ridiculous car registration fees, along with some of the highest fees in the country for just about everything else.  Our gas prices are some of the highest in the country.  We have 9% of the U.S. population, yet have 33% of the welfare expense. Illegal immigration is running amok. I would bet half of the children in the L.A. unified school district at this point are anchor babies. (I remember mobile clinic quite well in dental school..went to USC myself). Businesses are leaving California in Droves, and when energy prices and other restrictions increase it is only going to get worse.
Fortunately, as a dentist I can work anywhere.  However, for those of you planning to stay in this state, you need to get off your high ideological horses and start facing reality.  This green industry so many of you think will materialize will be far overshadowed by other job losses.  It is going to be you and 30 other people competing for every job soon.  Actually, that’s already the case…its only going to get worse.
Thank God that I do not live in California. To vote NO on Proposition 23 is akin to drinking the koolaid provided by Jim Jones.
Really doctor dave? Really? I’m glad you don’t live in california either. Stick to areas where critical thinking and fact checking is discouraged. Allow California to provide the intelligent solutions that the rest of the country will soon follow.
The U.S. could go to zero emissions and it would not make a difference the way other nations are building up.
Doctor Dave thank God you don’t live here, Stay in you trailer
My Dog, people, does EVERYTHING have to be about money?  Heavens, it’s going to cost me more to run my vacuum cleaner, so I guess kids in the future should just breathe smog!  How do these people who whine about a little more cost justify their existence on this planet??
An incredibly over simplified viewpoint you have there.
Don’t we want to make pot legal?
92% of funding for Yes on 23 comes from oil; 71% comes from out of Calif.  So WTF are oil and out-of-state interests supporting 23?   Ans: $$$
Yes on 23 claims it will save 1 million jobs; Calif labor says the opposite.  I’m inclined to distrust big oil.
The issue with Prop 23 is the clause for 5.5% unemployment rate.  Considering that the natural unemployment rate is usually thought of being close to 6%, there is little possibility that the bill would ever be repealed.  That clause is merely put in there to snake its way through for people who ultimately want to defend the environment but hold a higher priority for the economy–without realizing that the environment isn’t even a factor for this proposition at all.
Sounds a lot like the PG&E Monopoly act in 2008.  “Sure you can go into the power business..it just will take a 2/3 impossible super-majority.”  They called that one the “voters rights” bill.  It was a sham.  I can’t stand corporate meddling with our affairs any longer.  How is this legal?  I have an idea.  Lets pass a the “FU” bill, which bars any corporate donations to political campaigns in California.  Get these greedy a&&holes out of our state politics.
AB32 is a tax on energy production. We already have plenty of taxes, we don’t need  another one.
For short-sighted people such as yourself, that’s what it is.  But it benefits green tech by making it more cost-effective and cost-competitive.  So its a give and take.  But typical conservatives like you can only see short-term.  If people like you ruled the world, no one would ever invest in anything without an immediate payoff.  We’d be living in the stone age.
Can I get the legistlature to tax my compitition so my overpriced, unproven product can be”Cost-Effective and Cost-competitive”. Someday you will grow up but by then it will be too late to crawl out from under the foot of a government completely running your life and ditacting your thought.
No surprising with all the lies and misleading advertising that the no on 23 campaign is spreading.
The enforcement of AB 32 will cause an economic disaster for California that will keep other states from passing such legislation, and probably do more harm for the cause than it will help the environment.
Points to ponder on AB 32 / Prop 23:
° AB 32 is not a pollution law, it is a global warming law, but it won’t have any effect on global warming.
° Prop 23, in spite of fear-mongering by opponents, does not repeal any clean-air laws. It does not increase local pollution.
° CARB over-estimated diesel emmisions by 340%. What else have they over-estimated?
° Key CARB personnel caught lying about credentials and then failing to reveal this after it is discovered internally before AB 32 passed, until after AB 32 passed. What else are they lying about and with-holding?
° Sacramento State University reports estimated cost of $3734 per year per family due strictly to AB 32.
° CARB has admitted that California alone cannot have an impact on reducing global warming and CO2 emissions.
° US EPA acknowledges that US action alone will not impact the world CO2 levels;
° US EPA (11 July 2010) said that bills in Congress will not reduce the total use of gas and oil of 20 million gallons per day for decades.
° LAO (CA Legislative Analyst Office) stated: CA economy at large will be adversely affected by implementation of climate-related policies that are not in place elsewhere. (Letter to Dan Logue, 13 May 2010)
° Even CARB’s own economic experts have recognized the fact that jobs will be lost because of AB 32. In fact, they recommend establishing a “Worker Transition Program” to provide assistance to people who lose their jobs because of AB 32 regulations.
° AB 32 does nothing for local pollution, nor does Proposition 23 do anything to increase local pollution.
When the loudest objections to any candidacy or initiative are focused on vilifying its financial backers, this often indicates that its opponents’ arguments on its merits are weak.
Vote yes on Prop 23 and suspend AB32.
wow nice copy and pasting, this same exact post is on many more websites, go away troll your post is irrelivent
The California Jobs Initiative (CJI) is an oil corporation farce and fraud. There is no connection, whatsoever, between greenhouse gas emission reduction and the loss of jobs. This notion is an insult to the intelligence of the people of California. In fact, there is job growth in the clean, renewable energy industry. Chevron employs 65,000 worldwide and CJI is not going to change this. The only jobs created by the oil industry are clean-up jobs after oil spills and deep water, blow-outs and pump-handler jobs jobs. CJI will make fantastic profits for the oil industry, increase air pollution, especially in communities around their refineries and there will not be lower gas prices. Koch Industries, Valero and Tesoro are super Enrons. Since when did the oil companies start to show any concern for the unemployed and their families and for small businesses?
I’m just curious what business it is that you own/operate?  Of course more regulation and higher energy cost will have an affect on jobs.  Lets face it, if there were money to be made in this “green energy” sector don’t you think entrepreneurs would be jumping all over this. They would be happy to put money up front to get a return later.  But, unlike you, they understand California’s anti-business climate and aren’t going near it with a ten foot pole. Any manufacturing jobs will quickly be outsourced overseas.  So, sit and hold your breath waiting for those jobs to materialize.
Why doesn’t this article bother to interview any student activists who support Prop. 23?  With tens of thousands of USC students you really couldn’t find even one that supports Prop. 23?  You also use just one poll to show that Prop. 23 has “little support in California,” but you fail to mention two polls in the last couple of weeks that show Prop. 23 ahead – the PPIC poll and the Los Angeles Times poll.  In fact, the PPIC poll found Prop. 23’s strongest support was from young people.  I for one support jobs and the economy, not billions in new energy taxes on an expensive law that other states are smart enough to know is a bad idea during this recession.

USC received the world’s largest library collection concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender research from the ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives this week.
The archive is the largest of its kind in the nation, with 60,000 items including books, magazines, videos, drawings and 600 linear feet of archives.
According to Greg Williams, vice president of ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives, the collection consists of primary resources such as documents, organizational papers, diaries and personal papers. The university is well-equipped to handle the archives, he said.
“We felt that an institute with a long-term presence would be able to make it more accessible to the USC community, the community at large and the LGBT community,” Williams said. “[It is] more advantageous to be associated with a larger institution.”
The ONE organization has been associated with USC for almost 15 years, Williams said, and it moved into a USC-owned building in the early 2000s. Williams said ONE and USC had agreed that ONE would loan the archives but still own them.
After many years in which the collection grew with the support of many grants, ONE realized that what they had was so overwhelming that the collection would benefit from being in the care of a larger institution, he said.
The archives are full of publications that reflect gay culture in not only Los Angeles but also other parts of the world.
According to Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC libraries, the archive contains almost everything pertaining to LGBT history and influence.
“It’s a remarkable collection — the diversity of it is really amazing,” Quinlan said. “[It] ties together all the LGBT material worldwide.”
There are more than 6,000 LGBT titles of magazines and periodicals dating back to the late ’50s and early ’70s, including archives from people who are prominent in the LGBT community and have had an impact, such as former member of the Board of Supervisors Harvey Milk. The archive contains campaign materials from his election and a collection of campaign buttons.
The collection also includes art that USC will not take.
Papers of Jim Kepner,  one of the original founders of ONE, are also in the collection. There are about 150 to 200 archival collections with papers and original documents from important figures.
“I think what’s really interesting is that we have an enormous reservoir of early periodicals,” Williams said. “We have a complete sets of [ONE] Magazine, and it was the first homosexual magazine.”
There are also early photos from The Advocate, an LGBT magazine.
By donating the collection to USC, the collection will be protected for a long time, he said. It will stay at its current location at 909 West Adams Blvd. and will still have the support of ONE.
Quinlan also said that the organization was looking for a place that would use the collections. Various departments — including anthropology, gender studies and other programs — will utilize the collection for teaching and research purpose. 
“I encourage students to come down and see the collection and see how extensive it is,” Williams said. “We have everything from photographs in a scrapbook to the sheet music early cross-dressers used in the early 20th century.”
Emily Allen, the president of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, said the ONE institute was a great organization for LGBT resources.
“The availability of the resources will encourage people to check it out,” Allen said. “I think it definitely shows that our school has an interest for this.”
This is Great News!

The Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena is famous for being the home of the Tournament of Roses football game, but to many Southern California residents it has another claim to fame.
Bazaar world · Located in the historic Rose Bowl Stadium, the monthly flea market is a treasure trove for those who are looking to inexpensive alternatives to the high-end shopping centers of Los Angeles. - Mollie McKenzie | Daily Trojan 
For more than 40 years the Rose Bowl Flea Market has brought together a group of more than 2,500 vendors and 2 million  items of interest on the second Sunday of every month. Its assortment of different booths sell anything from vintage and high-end designer clothing to rare knickknacks and home furnishings.  With free parking and a relatively cheap $8 entrance fee, fashionistas and bargain hunters are able to search aisles upon aisles of unique merchandise from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., with some vendors staying open until 4:30 p.m.
The market has a carnival-like atmosphere, with people on stilts towering over shoppers and unicyclists weaving in and out of the ticket lines, making it a worthwhile experience for even those just looking for a day of fun.  Live music greets customers as they make their way through the turnstile gateway.
Immediately after the entrance is the food court, where shoppers can take a break from their hard labor and sit beneath the shade of an umbrella. A smörgåsbord of options are offered, including fresh-squeezed lemonade, carne asada burritos and gluttonous jumbo beer brats, with prices anywhere between $5-$9.
Beyond the food court, a shopaholic’s heaven unfolds.
Vintage clothing seems to be a mainstay of the flea market, with more than 600 vendors catering to that niche. With today’s overpriced vintage knock offs, many fashioned-minded college students on a tight budget can find it hard to find that special outfit without overdrawing their bank accounts or wearing the same outfit 20 others bought from Forever 21.
The Rose Bowl Flea Market’s sea of vintage and designer clothing racks make it possible for college students to stay within their budgets and find those real leather boots that none of their friends have. Shoppers can find anything that fits their personal taste, from ’60s bell-bottom jeans and ’70s psychedelic print dresses to graphic band T-shirts.
Specialty shopping is also extremely popular at the flea market. Rare vinyl records from classic rock bands can be found at $3 a record or a black leather Chanel purse for $400 — special bargain prices that come with the flea market experience. Many designers or sellers will also sometimes lower the price to half the amount they usually ask for their items at a regular store.
Another unique factor of the flea market is that customers have the opportunity to interact and talk fashion with the vendors and up-and-coming designers.
“It’s like a mobile showroom,” said vendor Melissa Diner, describing her vintage shop, The General Store, a collection of new and used clothing, shoes and accessories from different designers and brands.
One designer who was included in The General Store is Suzy Lequeux, whose jewelry brand “Rossmore LA,” is a one example of the unique artistry shoppers can find at the Rose Bowl Flea Market.
“The idea was inspired by a long carved Abalone shell piece I had found at the flea market,” Lequeux said, describing one of her original necklaces which she calls “the Laughter.” “I found shells that I broke, drilled holes into and then molded and cast the pieces.”
Although Lequeux necklaces usually sell for more than $100 at stores such as Fred Segal, Lequeux sold them at the flea market for half the price.
James Price of the Haus of Price was another designer featured in The General Store’s section. He was selling his one-of-a-kind striped and transparent top for only $20.
With designer items at low prices, it’s understandable why the 15-20,000 buyers come back to the Rose Bowl market.
“My favorite thing about the Rose Bowl is the vintage and antiques you can find at amazing prices,” Diner said. “It’s like one big thrift store.”
Los Angeles is an ideal city for “one big thrift store” where multiple styles and designs can be found in one place — at a great price.

You might have thought that the seminal animated series The Simpsons ran out of good bits for its “couch gag” introduction by now. After all, the show is in its 22nd season — that’s 467 episodes — which is a long, long time to keep coming up with ideas.
And, for the most part, audiences seem to have accepted the opening sequences for what they’re worth: amusing asides. At least in recent memory, the couch gag has not exactly been poignant, meaningful or controversial.
Then, the Oct. 10 episode came along and changed all that.
This particular sequence begins as usual — Bart writing on a chalkboard and Homer being lax with nuclear products — but dramatically changes course right as the family sits down on its couch.
Lights flicker and the camera zooms out: It’s a sweatshop full of workers drawing individual animations cels of the characters. A young barefoot boy carries a drawing and rinses it in toxic waste. Underground, kittens are thrown in a woodchipper , their white fluff used to stuff Bart Simpson dolls. A panda, pulling a loaded cart, is whipped. A weary Asian man punches out the centers of DVDs on the horn of an emaciated unicorn. Somber orchestral music reminiscent of the Schindler’s List score plays in the background. And to top it all off, the gag ends with a shot of the 20th Century Fox logo surrounded with barbed wire.
It’s a sequence that conjures up several emotions and reactions. There are a plethora of facial expressions that might occur from watching it: possibly an incredulous eyebrow raise, perhaps squinting coupled with a slightly dropped jaw or maybe even an awkward chuckle.
After all, this isn’t the usual lighthearted fare we’ve come to expect from the show. How could this have passed muster? How did it get past the censors and hawk-like eyes of Fox management?
Welcome to today’s world of culture jamming.
Culture jamming is the delicate art of subverting mainstream aspects of pop culture, using the original medium as a weapon against itself. The tactic is delicate because — when done right — the result is subtle but disarmingly effective.
The concept of the Oct. 10 Simpsons opening came from the mind of Banksy, the intriguingly talented (and secretive) graffiti artist from Britain. His portfolio of incognito street art is a veritable treasure chest of culture jamming.
One notable example is a giant mural spelling out the words “One Nation Under CCTV,” another shows an olive branch-holding dove with a bulletproof vest and a target on its chest. When the producers of The Simpsons reached out to him for some contribution, he sent them storyboards for this bombshell of an opening. The idea begged the question: Could it be done?
“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about for a little bit,” executive producer Al Jean said in an interview with The New York Times. But when questioned about the relevancy of the conditions portrayed in Banksy’s criticism, Jean was quick to deny it.
“I have to say, it’s very fanciful, far-fetched,” he said. “None of the things he depicts are true. That statement should be self-evident, but I will emphatically state it.”
Jean is right, of course. No pandas are whipped in the production of The Simpsons. Boxes are not taped using a dead dolphin’s tongue. There is no unicorn abuse.
Obviously, the images portrayed are fanciful. But is there some truth behind the façade of the ridiculous?
This is the question that culture jamming strives to conjure. The technique preys on the potentially ignorant, the naïve, those who “just don’t get it.” All the others are left with a glaring message that also happens to be glaringly out of place, heightening the impact.
Remember Stephen Colbert (of The Colbert Report fame) at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner? He waltzed in and calmly tore President George W. Bush, the Bush administration and the media apart, using his humor and persona as a front for the scathing criticism delivered (an excerpt: “The greatest thing about this man is he’s steady. You know where [Bush’s] stands. He believes the same thing Wednesday as he did Monday. No matter what happened Tuesday.”)
Turns out, Colbert was invited by the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association who, according to New York magazine, “hadn’t seen much of Colbert’s work.”
The often-elusive nature of culture jamming is what makes understanding the method and results so complicated. Yes, Jean and show creator Matt Groening wanted Banksy’s couch gag to happen. That makes sense, considering that the show has a history of satirizing its network.
But the sequence also makes the commercialization and growth of The Simpsons just look bad. Could it be that the true meaning of the sequence actually slipped past everyone involved but Banksy himself? Some comments by Jean are illuminating.
“Obviously, the animation to do this was pricey. I couldn’t have just snuck it by Fox. I’ll just say it’s a place where edgy comedy can really thrive, as long as it’s funny, which I think this was,” Jean said. “None of it’s personal.”
I’m not so sure I buy that. Here’s the million-dollar question: Is the sequence really funny, or does it just seem funny? Those are two completely different things, leading to two potentially completely different meanings.
Outsourced consumerism and worker abuse, fueled by the licensing abilities of major networks, is a current reality. And the opening certainly doesn’t seem to simply be a light jab at the network. So who’s actually laughing?
In the end, I can only think of one person: Banksy himself, who’s probably very pleased at the impossible mission he just pulled off.
Eddie Kim is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. His column, “Culture Clash,” runs Thursdays.
You better develop some thick skin boy! because I too, “would be careful of condescension when one doesn’t understand the point.” It’s your job as a journalist to act automaton-like when disseminating your ideas/opinions.
LOL, back when I wrote for the DT as a columnist in 1999-2000 the idea of culture jamming was relatively new.  Now it’s old hat –and masterfully done by Banksy.  I don’t know what’s more depressing, that this passed through the DT editorial process, that it appeared on my Google search of news on the “simpsons Banksy opening” or that anyone things The Simpsons is any good anymore (the minute-and-a-half intro notwithstanding).  That show lost its steam (coincidentally) around 2000.  I knew the show was doomed when Fox execs visited our class in 1999 and told us that they were now considering the show and its characters to be a “signature property” (IP property) a la Mickey Mouse to Disney.  That spelled doom.  Anyway, sorry if my criticism was a tad harsh –you’re still young and college papers are for getting your feet wet –good luck.
amazing.

As Halloween draws closer, some people find more daring ways to celebrate than stocking up on candy corn. Long before the television show Ghost Hunters, haunted houses have intrigued both tourists and locals. If you are up for a bit of history with your All Hallows Eve festivities, check out some of these Los Angeles haunts.
The Pantages Theatre
6233 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90028
Think the current production of The Phantom of the Opera is the most ghostly thing at the Pantages? Displaying a similarly obsessive nature, the ghost of one of the theater’s former owners, Howard Hughes, predates the Phantom at the theater by a few decades.
People have also heard the singing voice of a woman who died during the showing of a film in the 1930s — one time her lonely song was even picked up by the stage mics. But the Pantages’ ghosts do not seem malevolent, as a wardrobe lady said she once felt a helpful, albeit owner-less hand lead her out of the theater during a blackout.
So, if the show is over and you have time to kill, poke around the Pantages for some gorgeous architecture and a potential visit from Hughes.
The Coliseum
3939 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, Calif. 90037
You don’t have to go far from USC to get some ghostly thrills. If you’re bored by the game, check out the top floor of the stadium during the fourth quarter. In the 1960s a man fell to his death, and people report seeing his ghost as the games draw to a close. Also reported is the sound of bones crunching — and that’s not from failed touchdowns.
The Queen Mary
1126 Queens Highway, Long Beach, Calif. 90802
Also known as the Long Beach Hotel, this ship-turned-hotel-turned-museum is one of the most famous haunts in Los Angeles.
Considering 49 people have died on the ship during her 60-year history, it makes statistical sense that a few stuck around.
Visitors have reported the visages of ghostly swimmers, sailors and gentleman dressed in black. Spend the night if you dare, or check out the hotel’s famous “Dining with the Spirits,” a Saturday dinner followed by a ghost tour of the ship.
The Knickerbocker Hotel
1714 Ivar Ave., Los Angeles, Calif. 90028
Now the Hollywood Knickerbocker Apartments, a senior citizen community, the Knickerbocker Hotel has a past as grisly as it is glamorous.
Stars such as Rudolph Valentino and Marilyn Monroe loved to stop in, and Elvis Presley slept over while shooting Love Me Tender.
Meanwhile, director D. W. Griffith died of a stroke under the hotel’s chandelier and actor William Frawley died of a heart attack in the lobby. In the 1960s, a lovelorn costume designer jumped from her 11th-floor window.
Most ghost sightings have been near the bar, so add some adventure to your drink order.
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
7000 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90028
Some people love stalking movie stars. They should hang out at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Many have reported seeing Monroe in a mirror that once hung in her suite. Others have seen 1950s star Montgomery Clift, looking just as moody as he did in the films that made him famous.
The Blossom Ballroom also has a famous cold spot — an area where people report feeling chilled for no reason.
The Silent Movie Theatre
611 N. Fairfax Ave., Los Angeles, Calif. 90048
Even if silent movies are relics from another age, they still have their fans — namely, the two former owners of The Silent Movie Theatre.
The first owner, John Hampton, died from exposure to the chemicals he used to restore silent film prints. The second owner, Lawrence Austin, was shot in the lobby.
Today, Hampton still stays in his former apartment, now a lounge, and Austin hangs out in the lobby. Both ghosts get along just fine with the theater’s current owner.
The Comedy Store
8433 W. Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90069
Maybe hip clubs are more your style than old hotels. At The Comedy Store, there are more things afoot than just questionable restroom activities. Formerly known as Ciro’s, this dive was a hot spot for mob figures.
Now, the club has a few permanent guests. Some are prankish, such as a voiceless caller from the nonexistent Line 31, while others are more sinister — the angry ghost of a betrayed hitman and the publicly shamed spirit of a woman who performed illegal abortions.
Guests have also experienced cold spots, an indicator of paranormal activity.
Hollywood Forever Cemetery
6000 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90038
What haunted roundup would be complete without a boneyard? Icons such as Charlie Chaplin Jr. and Cecil B. DeMille now rest in Hollywood Forever. A few don’t sleep so peacefully.
Some have felt a chill and heard sobs near the grave of Virginia Rappe, famous for a scandal and court case involving Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle. Early film star Rudolph Valentino also likes stroll through the grounds. But so does the specter of his biggest fangirl, a black-veiled woman who left flowers at his grave.

Although Everybody’s Kitchen was granted a redo by public health officials and raised its inspection grade from a “B” to an “A” on Sept. 17, the dining hall has not made enduring adjustments to improve the subpar taste and nutritional value of its food.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
As a result, students who have purchased the $2,450 meal plan are spending additional money to avoid the cafeteria and buy food at franchises such as Baja Fresh and California Pizza Kitchen. The obvious solution to stop students from spending more to avoid the place they originally spent their money on is to improve the food quality of EVK. The key to improving EVK for the long-term, however, is student advocacy.
Students might have been understandably alarmed when the cafeteria received a “B” rating from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health after a random inspection on Sept. 19. EVK’s violations — which were minor and did not pose a major threat to students’ health — included high refrigerator temperatures, lack of lids for food storage and dirty kitchen floors.
EVK regained its “A” after fixing broken equipment and increasing the rigor of kitchen checks, but students are plagued with another significant concern: poor-tasting food lacking in nutritional value. Hospitality officials addressed the dirty floors and lukewarm refrigerators, but students’ lack of confidence in EVK means that many continue to spend extra money to dodge the dining hall.
“I’m hungry until I step into EVK,” said Amy Mendoza, a freshman majoring in psychology. “My mom specifically upgraded me to the Trojan Plan so I could avoid EVK.”
Freshmen living in USC housing are required to buy a meal plan at a minimum cost of $2,450 per semester. This basic Cardinal Meal Plan provides unlimited meal swipes at EVK and Parkside Restaurant, but no dining dollars for other on-campus eateries including those at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Some students upgrade to the Trojan Meal Plan and pay $3,050 per semester for dining dollar access to other venues.
The notion that students must pay even more to get a decent meal on campus is unacceptable. As long as USC Hospitality requires freshmen to spend $2,450 on a meal plan, it is reasonable for students to expect “A” health ratings, nutritious options and appetizing meals. This is where student advocacy comes in to play.
In fall 2008 the Facebook group “OPERATION: Spice up EVK” collected students’ suggestions, and the cafeteria staff implemented changes such as increasing the number of vegetarian options and offering fresh fruit at the salad bar. Representatives from the University Residential Student Community Advocacy Board spearheaded the movement, and student satisfaction with EVK was successfully given a much-needed leg up.
Although it didn’t benefit EVK specifically, another example of student activism that made a positive impact on dining halls was the URSC Parkside Recipe Challenge, in which students submitted their own recipes to be prepared by Parkside’s staff, and diners voted on their favorite meals. The winning recipes were then added to the cafeteria’s rotation of meal options.
By urging the cafeteria staff to implement specific changes, these student programs resulted in more appealing choices. It is time for students to again take ownership of the effort to improve USC’s dining halls; increased communication between diners and hospitality officials can create a new culture at EVK. It has before, and can do so again.
Student advocacy has its hurdles; by maintaining consistent conversation with department leaders, students have the opportunity to execute changes and provide feedback regardless of a rotating cafeteria staff.
Seeking guidance from one of USC’s registered dieticians is another option for students to take ownership of their nutrition. Dieticians host programs on campus, and aid students in mapping out their meals to maintain a balanced diet and still enjoy foods that please the palate.
Based on past movements such as these, hospitality officials have proven their willingness to collaborate with students. Students must take responsibility to work with these officials and ensure that dining halls offer meals that are healthy and enjoyable. Positive programming and student advocacy can forge a path to improving USC’s cafeterias for the long-term, making EVK a hub for both nutritious food and student community.
Kelsey Clark is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism.
Correction: 10/19/10: The opening sentence in the previous version of this story read: “…the dining hall not made enduring adjustments to improve the subpar taste and nutritional value of its food…” The sentence should read “…the dining has not made enduring adjustments to improve the subpar taste and nutritional value of its food…” This version has been corrected to reflect the change.
Or the Hospitality staff could do what they’re paid to do.

One hundred and thirty years ago, USC’s first class of students set foot on campus.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Since then, the reins of power have changed hands only 10 times. We have seen 10 presidents shape the legacy of our university — this week, USC students will help ring in the 11th.
The inauguration of President C.L. Max Nikias on Friday is anything but a routine passing of the torch at USC — it will be a defining moment for our university.
Staff, students, alumni and loyal Trojan fans are anxious to hear what the new president will have to say about his vision for the university’s future.
Although Friday will be full of celebration and applause, Nikias will likely argue that from this day forward our university has a challenging mission ahead — to make even greater academic strides on top of the progress we’ve already made.
Nikias must take advantage of the attention granted to him in that moment and assure students that his values — as an administrator and as a parent of two USC students — are what’s needed to get the university on the move.
In his address to students, Nikias must also communicate a vision to combine two fields that he is passionate about and that are vital to USC’s continued rise: the arts and innovative technology.
As an advocate of liberal arts education, Nikias was at the forefront in the creation of the Visions  and Voices program on campus — a creative and popular experience for many students.
Nikias has also been instrumental in the university’s mission to utilize research in the creation of new technologies and products that advance society’s interest.
The result? Nikias was the first to be recognized as the holder of the Malcolm R. Currie Chair in Technology and the Humanities — a testament to his passion for bringing two seemingly contrasting fields into a common university purpose.
In a world where different fields are becoming increasingly intertwined, this recognition shows that Nikias is progressive enough to encourage students to combine seemingly disparate areas of study, such as through the Renaissance Scholars program.
Motivating students to hone their skills in different fields is the kind of the leadership we need right now. We need leadership that adapts to the changing times, yet remains rooted in the university’s commitment to making a global impact.
Nineteen years ago, when President Steven B. Sample assumed office, USC was not remotely competitive with the school just across town in Westwood.
Now, we are on par with the most historically respected schools in the nation, gradually nabbing prospective students from the Harvards and Stanfords of the country and enrolling them here at USC.
But if our university is going to continue its climb in the rankings, competing with the top schools to attract the best and brightest students, it demands the right leadership at the right time.
Hopefully, Nikias will use his inauguration speech to highlight that he is just this.
With his 19 years at USC as professor, researcher, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering and as USC’s provost, Nikias clearly knows the university at all levels. It isn’t just his experience that matters, but his multifaceted involvement at USC as well.
He can expand the working coalition that benefits all of us here on campus — students, staff and faculty — and take every voice into consideration as we move forward, something students are always relieved to hear.
Most of us might not remember every nook and cranny of Nikias’ professional and personal background. Nor is Nikias likely to boast of it, even during his long-awaited inauguration ceremony.
But what we can take away from this historic event on Friday is that, above all, Nikias is a champion of students’ hopes and futures.
And of course, expect Nikias to do what he has done to conclude previous speeches — raise two fingers and yell, “Fight On!”
Stephen Zelezny is a sophomore majoring in public relations. His column, “USC on the Move,” runs Thursdays.
“The study, conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers  (NACUBO), found that the endowments at universities nationwide lost an average of 18.7 percent in value. USC lost 25.6 percent in endowment funds — nearly 7 percent more than the national average. That 25.6 percent translated into a $1.2 billion loss between July 2008 and June 2009.
“The survey is in its 39th year, and this is the largest decline we’ve seen in its history,” NACUBO’s director of research and policy Kenneth Redd said.” Daily Trojan Feb. 11, 2010
I would like to hear “President” Nikias explain in his inaugural what he intends to do to recover the $1.2 Billion in endowment losses which he oversaw (during a relatively flat market period) as “Provost” Nikias. Were USC a public institution, the portfolio breakdowns would have had to have been made public. One cannot help but suspect that incompetent, if not downright criminal, negligence was involved.
[…] Daily Trojan writes that in his inauguration speech, "Nikias will likely argue that from this day forward our […]

USC is using several social media sites for the Inauguration of USC President C.L. Max Nikias this Friday.
For the past few weeks, the inauguration Facebook page has posted biweekly trivia questions and given students USC-related prizes for answering them correctly.
USC is encouraging those on Twitter to use the hashtag #uscnikias this week to report back from the inauguration events they attend.
Additionally, on the day of the Inauguration, prizes will be given to 11 random Foursquare users who check in to the “USC Inauguration of C. L. Max Nikias.”
Foursquare allows its users to “check in” to real-world places and read “tips” from people who have been there previously, and also can cross-post to Facebook or Twitter. It is available as an app for iPhones, Blackberries and Android phones, or users can post via text message.
They left a tip at the University of Southern California (USC) and Alumni Park venues saying, “Don’t miss the inauguration of C. L. Max Nikias as president of USC on Oct. 15, 2010, at 10:00 a.m. in Alumni Park!”
The night before the inauguration, USC will create a venue called “USC Inauguration of C. L. Max Nikias,” which will have a tip with more contest information.

America’s favorite liger-loving high schooler is finally making the transition from the silver screen to television after Fox green lit production in six episodes of the new animated television series, Napoleon Dynamite.
The original cast will all return to provide their vocal talents to the animated characters, including Jon Heder in a reprise of the role that catapulted his career in 2004. Also lending their talents are Jared and Jerusha Hess, the husband-and-wife filmmaking team behind Dynamite, who will supervise the production from executive producer positions.
Though Dynamite’s adaptation from cinema to television was inevitable, Fox’s move is still surprising. Fox would never allow the prospect of extended revenue from the highest grossing Sundance film ever to simply go unexplored.
Yet, after six years of inaction, the idea of expanding the Dynamite brand appeared to be problematic for the bizarre 2004 comedy. How could the quirky humor of the original film come across with the same effect in another medium?
Fox finally realized the brilliant solution of translating the movie into hand-drawn animation, the same medium utilized by Napoleon himself in the film when he draws his mythical creature masterworks. More information about the series can be found at Nellie Andreeva’s blog.

On Tuesday the Obama administration lifted its ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
The moratorium, imposed after the BP oil spill that began in April, was established to curb the effects of the lax safety and environmental regulations that were later deemed key contributors to the crisis, according to the New York Times.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar noted significant strides have been made in risk reduction in the deepwater drilling process since the aftermath of the spill. As a result, he said, the ban is no longer necessary.
“I have decided that it is now appropriate to lift the suspension … for those operators that are able to clear the higher bar that we have set,” Salazar told the Times.
Though the Obama administration cited the moratorium as necessary for safety reasons, critics say it caused a loss of 8,000 to 12,000 jobs throughout the Gulf region, according to MSNBC.
The new Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement – formerly the Minerals
Management Service – established new rules that include tougher standards for well design, blowout preventers, safety certification, emergency response and worker training.
“The oil and gas industry will be operating under tighter rules, stronger oversight, and in a regulatory environment that will remain dynamic as we continue to build on the reforms we have already implemented,” Salazar said.
Before they can commence drilling, offshore operators will be required to submit applications proving compliance with the new rules and undergo rig inspection.
Officials are unsure as to when the first permit will be issued, but expect some rigs to be up and running by the end of this year.
Compliance with the new regulations should cost the deepwater industry $183 million a year, according to BOEMRE estimates.

As Halloween rustles closer, listen for another kind of crackling: candy wrappers. Each year, Americans spend more on candy than they do on decorations and costumes. Some seasonal favorites include candy corn, Peeps and anything labeled “Party” or “Fun Size.” Every year, however, promises a few shakeups.
Fresh on the horizon are Peeps. For years we’ve had those Easter marshmallow fluff balls popping up as pumpkins and ghosts – reenacting Christianity’s takeover of Paganism – but this year, they come coated in chocolate.
For those still playing catch-up on the candy front, M&M’s now come in a salty-sweet pretzel variety, not to mention swanky fall colors.
If you want some luxury with your sugar coma, Godiva has just rolled out its line of Halloween exclusives: chocolate bat, skulls, and pumpkin lollipops; pumpkin-spice ganache and caramel apple truffles, and candy-coated milk chocolate pearls.
Lastly, if you still want to fit into your corset on the 31st, My Mixed Nuts has a special on “Goblin Gorp” – 30 1-ounce bags of dry roasted salted almonds, raw pumpkin seeds, dried mango and raisins, and all-natural M&M’s.
So revel in the Halloween festivities and add a few new treats to the brew. Just don’t forget your toothbrush.
