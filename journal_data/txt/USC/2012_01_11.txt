The Los Angeles Police Department honored Christina Wilkerson, a student who helped save the life of a victim of a shooting, in a Wednesday ceremony honoring local heros.
Wilkerson, a senior majoring in sociology, ended up at a party on the 1200 block of West 37th Place on Sept. 4, where a confrontation between a friend and an uninvited guest over allegedly stolen property escalated quickly and resulted in a shot being fired after Wilkerson intervened.
Wilkerson’s actions after the shooting, which included providing her friend with CPR, proved critical in helping the victim retain consciousness until emergency responders arrived at the scene.
Four months later, with her friend recovered and the story having spread across the city and the state, officials honored Wilkerson for her efforts Wednesday night at the Los Angeles Police Department Operations South Bureau’s Community Heroes event at USC’s Town and Gown.
“I wasn’t going to be there that night,” Wilkerson said. “I feel like it kind of was destiny, like I was supposed to be there.”

When the altercation began that night, Wilkerson said her thoughts turned toward the more than 30 other party attendees.
“Nothing was going through my mind and everything was going through my mind,” Wilkerson said. “My first thought was to make sure everyone in the house was safe. The situation went from zero to 100 in five seconds.”
Wilkerson, along with other L.A.-area heroes, was honored in front of more than 100 members of the LAPD and USC communities, including LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, LAPD Commissioner John Mack and Dept. of Public Safety Assistant Chief John Thomas.
Thomas commended Wilkerson’s potentially life-saving actions, especially those vital minutes following the shooting.
“What she did afterwards was truly heroic,” Thomas said. “She had the presence of mind to administer CPR to the person who was wounded and she continued to talk to him.”
Wilkerson, who is also a student worker for DPS, learned CPR during a three-hour seminar at her local church. Though Wilkerson had not administered CPR previously, she said instinct took over in the aftermath of the shooting.
“It really was an out-of-body experience,” Wilkerson said. “I don’t know how I was able to be so calm. I knew exactly what was happening from the moment I saw the gun to the moment I was giving my friend CPR.”
Thomas and DPS Capt. David Carlisle encouraged students to learn CPR at seminars similar to the one Wilkerson took part in but stressed that her actions were unusual.
“What she did was admirable and took a lot of courage, but it’s not something we encourage people to do,” Carlisle said. “She could have been seriously injured. There are some instances when you’re forced to take action.”
Wilkerson was quick to play down the unusual nature of her actions, emphasizing the ability of others to be everyday heroes.
Wilkerson said heroes are everywhere on campus, such as students who volunteer for USC’s Joint Educational Project.
“All of us have something within us to be heroic,” Wilkerson said. “Anytime you help someone else out, that’s you being a hero.”
Tyson Tyree Smith was arrested Sept. 14 and was charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault in connection with the shooting. Smith plead not guilty on all counts.
 
The Daily Trojan previously incorrectly reported that the female victim of the shooting, Wilkerson, was a graduate student.
THIS IS SO DOPE!! Christina, you need to put on a costume and run around the city at night with theme music!!
Christina, you are amazing! Truely a real life hero in so many ways.  The article forgot to mention that Christina was injured in the shooting. In the midst of HER hand being shot, SHE was still able to care for the other victim. I am speechless, no words to describe how proud of you I am!  You are a star, and angel, a ray of light for us all.  Thank God no one died, and I am so happy they caught the shooter.
Kudos to a young lady who has ALWAYS been the best and most supportive individual a person can have in his or her life. The situation was completely unfortunate, but it was no surprise to me that Christina stepped in the way she did, and saved her peer’s life. 
God graces people in different ways, and it has been God’s grace over Christina’s ENTIRE life that has always made her the: courageous, valiant, beautiful, smart, successful, and AMAZING human being she is today. 
WE LOVE & ARE PROUD OF YOU! 
Your Sister
A job well done!
she got that from her grandmother who is also silent hero to so many. I’m proud to know you Christina and stay blessed
Good job.
Thank you from her father

USC took another step on Wednesday toward obtaining day-to-day control of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
The university, along with the Coliseum Commission, the stadium’s nine-member governing body, released a list of terms outlining modifications to the existing lease, which was enacted in 2008.
Agreement · According to the term sheet, the university would be allowed to sell naming rights for the Coliseum as long as the name includes “Memorial Coliseum.” - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The 16-page terms sheet outlines major provisions that would be included in an amended lease. If agreed upon, the term sheet would be transferred into an amended lease document subject to the commission’s vote.
“We are moving toward entering into a long-term master lease with USC, where USC would be the master tenant at the Coliseum and be responsible for operating and maintaining the stadium,” said L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the commission. “In exchange for this long- term lease, USC will be obligated to undertake several tens of millions of dollars in improvements to the stadium that the Coliseum desperately needs.”
Under the proposed list of terms, USC will have the exclusive right to manage the Coliseum, the adjacent Los Angeles Sports Arena, as well as other facilities around Exposition Park. It will also hold first refusal rights to lease the 88-year-old facility and be afforded the opportunity to extend the deal as far as 2054.
In 2007, the university lobbied for control of the publicly-owned venue before eventually agreeing upon the current 25-year lease that stipulates that the university annually gives eight percent of ticket sales and $1.8 million to the commission provided the commission supports upgrades to the stadium.
The commission, however, acknowledged in June it would be unable to make nearly $60 million in necessary renovations, breaking the terms of the original lease, which has led USC to seek day-to-day operational control of the facility.
“Primarily, we believe this facility needs to be improved,” said Tom Sayles, USC’s senior vice president for university relations. “The Coliseum currently has the obligation to make those improvements. We are willing to invest the money to make those improvements.”
Under the released terms, USC will be responsible for completing a list of renovations by the end of 2021. The exact cost is unknown.
“The Coliseum is at a crossroads,” Yaroslavsky said. “We can either make it a functioning, viable venue for athletic events, or we can make it a museum piece. We don’t want this to become like the Roman Colosseum. We want this to be the 21st century Los Angeles Coliseum.”
To help pay for the renovations, the school would be given the option to sell the naming rights of the stadium to a corporate sponsorship provided “Memorial Coliseum” is included in the name.
Under the terms of the master lease, USC can also make the Coliseum available to no more than one NFL team for up to four seasons, and outside of football season, the commission can reserve eight days to hold public events such as graduations or Fourth of July celebrations.
“What we want to make sure is that the public can continue to have access to this venue,” Sayles said. “They would have the right to come in and utilize the facility for a period of time.”
Coliseum Commission Vice President Don Knabe said he was optimistic about successful negotiations between the university and the commission.
“At the end of the day, hopefully we can negotiate the terms that are fair to both, fair to the public and preserve this wonderful facility for many years to come,” Knabe said.
Does this mean they will start selling beer again?

As the sixth-ranked USC Trojans enter the offseason, players, coaches and fans have a lot of things to remember from the 2011 season. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley threw a conference-record 39 touchdown passes, sophomore receiver Robert Woods and freshman receiver Marqise Lee totaled more than 1,000 yards receiving and, best of all, the Trojans went 10-2.
Another year wiser · Monte Kiffin and the USC defense allowed 400 yards per game during the 2010 season. One year later, the defense only allowed 23.6 points per game, ranking in the top-50 in the country. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
But behind the offensive fireworks stood a defense with a chip on its shoulder, and behind that defense stood a 70-year-old man many thought should have been fired after the 2010 season.
Monte Kiffin and the Trojan defense began the 2011 season as a major enigma. Many wondered whether Kiffin’s famous Tampa-2 defense would work in college football. He made a living in the NFL from this defensive strategy, which relies on speed and agility, especially linebackers who can drop back into pass coverage.
When Kiffin entered the college ranks in 2009, it was his first time coaching student-athletes since 1980. After a short tenure at Tennessee, Monte and son Lane ventured to Los Angeles to restore an explosive offensive and stingy defense.
Defensively speaking, things didn’t start off as planned, to say the least. During the 2010 season, the Trojans gave up 26.7 points and 400 yards per game defensively. Despite Monte Kiffin’s defensive prestige, something was not working.
Fast forward to 2011.
The Trojans gave up 23.6 points per game, ranking 45th in the country. That might not seem like a huge difference from the previous year, but a closer look at the numbers and the roster reveals that the squad had only two senior starters, and featured mostly freshman and sophomores, particularly at linebacker. Hidden behind that youth, though, was a perfect recipe for the Tampa-2 system.
The linebacking core was made up of redshirt freshmen Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard, senior Chris Galippo, and true freshman Lamar Dawson, who started the last few games of the season in Galippo’s place. Bailey was formerly a safety, and Hayes and Dawson are lightning quick on their feet. At defensive end were juniors Nick Perry, Wes Horton and Devon Kennard, all great athletes with the ability to get to the quarterback or play the run. The defensive backfield featured sophomore Nickell Robey and junior T.J. McDonald, who, combined, had five interceptions in 2011.
Monte Kiffin finally had the players he needed to compete in the ever-changing landscape of college football: his explosive linemen, linebackers and playmakers in the secondary.
The defensive improvement was most evident against Oregon, which was one of the top offenses in the country, averaged 46.1 points per game and racking up more than 520 yards a contest. The Trojan defense allowed 35 points, Oregon’s third-lowest output of the season, and by far the least amount of points they scored at Autzen Stadium. They forced turnovers and got to the quarterback. Their linebackers made plays in coverage. They held the nation’s leading rusher, LaMichael James, to 78 yards on the ground.
Though it might have taken a year longer than expected, Kiffin’s defense is finally in place. It was not a liability in 2011. It was a strength. The defense has the right players in place for 2012 with nine returning starters. With a preseason top-five ranking in sight, the Matt Barkley-led offense now features a defense that can match its play-making ability. As exciting as the defense was this past season, it figures to be even better next year, in the same way that the 2011 defense improved after 2010.
Oh, the difference a year makes.

The Pac-12 Conference has released its schedule over winter break for the 2012 season. Coming off a 10-2 season that saw them finish No. 6 in the AP poll, the Trojans know that an undefeated regular season could mean special things for the program.
USC will open its 2012 season Sept. 1 at the Coliseum against Hawai’i .
Following the home opener, the Trojans will travel east to take on Syracuse in New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium.
The game against the Orange will be the first time since 1990 that USC has played Syracuse in New Jersey.
USC  will face Stanford on the road and to gain some measure of revenge for the 56-48, triple-overtime loss they suffered in 2011.  The conference schedule follows, with a home game against Cal, road contests at Utah and Washington, Colorado’s first visit to the Coliseum, and then a trip to Arizona.
The toughest test for USC will likely come Nov. 3 at the Coliseum, when the defending Rose Bowl Champion Oregon makes the trek to Los Angeles for what could be a matchup of two top-five teams.
The Trojans then take on Arizona State at home before finishing the campaign with two rivalry games. The Trojans will play UCLA at the Rose Bowl before completing the regular season back home against the Fighting Irish.
If USC qualifies for the Pac-12 Championship game as expected, the team will play in its first conference title game on Nov. 30.

Not many teams in any sport ever have to deal with the loss of three two-time All-Americans.
But that’s what the Women of Troy will have to do next season when seniors setter Kendall Bateman, outside hitter Alex Jupiter and middle blocker Lauren Williams are no longer setting records for the women’s volleyball team.
Spiked · Seniors middle blocker Lauren Williams and setter Kendall Bateman helped lead the Women of Troy to two final four appearances, with the most recent in 2011 as USC lost to the University of Illinois Fighting Illini in five sets. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“It always looks bleak about this time of year when you’re losing great seniors,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We’ll have trouble with replacing all those points [they scored].”
The team’s ultimate goal for the season might not have been met, after USC (29-5) lost to the University of Illinois in the Final Four for the second consecutive year, but the graduating trio’s overall body of work is still impressive.
Jupiter became USC’s first recipient of the American Volleyball Coaches Association National Player of the Year Award and is the program’s all-time leader in kills (1,918) and points (2,255.5). The three-time All-American led the Pac-12 this season with 5.4 points per set while being named the Conference Player of the Year. She also had 32 kills and 12 digs in the Final Four matchup against Illinois.
“Jupiter has been the most durable,” Haley said. “She started for four years, she’s been a dynamic blocker and she’s been a great server. This year, Alex’s output was absolutely amazing.”
Bateman, along with sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund, rounded out USC’s list of first team All-Americans this season after leading the Pac-12 with 12.03 assists per set.
Haley praised Bateman, who was also named the Pac-12 Setter of the Year, for her intangibles.
“Kendall was the leader of the team, without question,” Haley said. “She was our captain for two years. … When you get that kind of leadership, everyone knuckles down.”
Haley also credited Williams for being a quiet, yet still important, leader in the locker room. The fifth-year senior was engaged in a position battle with sophomores Alexis Olgard and Hannah Schraer for most of the season after her blocking took a slight turn for the worse, but Williams never lost her starting spot or her composure.
“This was not her best year blocking,” Haley said of Williams, who still managed to earn third team All-American honors for the second straight year. “[But] she never felt threatened, that was what was interesting.”
Williams leaves USC with a .377 hitting percentage, the second-highest mark in school history.
In the past 12 seasons, since Haley came to USC in 2000, the Women of Troy have won two national championships, four conference championships and have appeared in the Final Four seven times, more than any other program.
In the end, the trio’s legacy — two Final Four berths (three for Williams, who redshirted during the team’s 2007 Final Four appearance) and the first conference championship since 2003 –— may be seen as just another four-year stretch of that successful run.
But Haley says the threesome, and the 2011 squad as a whole, was more than that.
“They’ve raised the bar in so many different areas,” Haley said. “I want people to appreciate them as much as I do. There’s 344 other schools [in Division I] that would like to be where these guys are.”
Fortunately for USC fans, Haley thinks that despite the loss of the trinity of decorated seniors, the Women of Troy’s remaining pieces will combine with the upcoming recruiting class to form yet another formidable squad.
“We’ve only lost nine matches since 2005 in [the Galen Center],” Haley said, referring to the team’s 77-9 home record since the facility opened. “That’s less than two per year. So when you come to a match here, you expect to see us win. … I just think the best is yet to come.”
You can’t give Haley credit for the year 2000 when Jerritt Elliot was the interim coach and won the Pacific
Region Coach of the Year honors.
There were only 6 final four appearances in 2002 – 03 – 04, 07 – 10 – 11. Show me which year was  #7.

It’s the cliché college scene: a dorm room decorated with pizza boxes, poorly hidden beer bottles and candy. Ramen is practically currency, and Ben & Jerry’s is the stand-in therapist.
Green machine · Thomaz Paschoal, a junior majoring in civil engineering, shops for fresh produce at the local Ralphs supermarket. In addition to saving you money in the long run, cooking for yourself is an easy and effective way to monitor your diet more accurately. - Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
College students aren’t particularly known for their healthy eating habits. But to dismiss the advantages of decent nutrition is silly: Good food keeps your energy up, your skin clear and certain — ahem — activities more regular.
Don’t be afraid to fight the truism. Eating healthy in college is easy, regardless of whether you shop at Safeway or Subway.
Cooking is the best way to control nutrition — you call the shots, ingredients and portions. And for those whose kitchen expertise ends with the microwave, college is the perfect time to learn.
An easy way to start is online. Websites like Eating Well and Oregon State’s Healthy Recipes provide a bevy of recipes to get you started. Cook This, Not That!, a men’s health publication, is an excellent primer for the kitchen newbie, as is Mark Bittman’s behemoth How To Cook Everything. And don’t  feel limited to health foods. Any recipe can be tailored to be as decadent or healthy as you desire.
Take, for instance, macaroni and cheese. It can be a gut-buster or a yummy and remarkably reasonable side. Swap cream for milk; trade some of the regular cheese for cottage cheese; replace refined flour pasta for whole wheat, quinoa or rice pasta. The result is a dish with more protein and fiber and fewer calories. No need to swap in fat-free cheese, either — that stuff is gross and doesn’t melt right. Just don’t eat the whole pot.
When Mom said to eat your veggies, she was right. Vegetables fill you up and supply vitamins. Since you now rule the kitchen, cook the ones you like. For the ones you don’t like, roast them in the oven, add chopped bacon and then reassess your opinion.
Other ways to cook healthy without making gourmands cry is to pick tasty swaps. Protein-rich Greek yogurt can replace sour cream in many recipes. Mustard-based dressings require less oil because the mustard acts as an emulsifier. Corn tortillas are higher in fiber and lower in calories than flour ones.
Good eating is not necessarily about cutting calories. Everyone needs vitamins and minerals, and they aren’t found in a bowl of frozen yogurt.
Strapped for cash? Cooking saves money. To further tighten the belt, choose foods in their most unprocessed forms. For example, a whole chicken is much cheaper than individual breasts and provides more portions. Break out a slow cooker or stock pot and create delicious soups that trump Campbell’s.
Cooking also cultivates a greater respect for food. It’s not just something to wolf down during Modern Family, but something to savor. Chewing, instead of hurriedly washing food down with iced tea, helps too.
But students are very busy. Between calculus classes and video games, sometimes there’s just no time to cook. In that case, it’s time to tackle eating out. With some quick thinking, you can still sneak in all your favorite indulgences.
Say you’re craving a hamburger. Ride forth and claim your meaty grail — but swap the fries for a salad this time. Booze or dessert? Bread or an appetizer? Beans or rice in your Yorkie-sized burrito? It’s all about priorities. And if you just want everything, adjust for that by decreasing portions across the board.
Many restaurants today dish up giant serving platters worth of food. Your mom isn’t around — you don’t need to clean your plate. In fact, you probably shouldn’t: Science has proven most people eat with their eyes and not their stomachs. Add a few margaritas and disaster is brewing. The easiest answer is to take some home for a quick lunch the next day. You save time, money and your waistline. Everybody wins! Except cellulite.
Another rule of thumb for healthier restaurant questing is to pick places with fresher food. Chick-fil-A’s nuggets are meatier and less breaded than McDonald’s. Lemonade creates gorgeous veggie and meat dishes, not limp-lettuce salads that smell like plastic. For those with extra cash, check out some of Los Angeles’ popular restaurants like Animal, Sugarfish and Real Food Daily. Their selections are natural and tasty and offer some culinary adventure.
Finally, good eats are only part of the health puzzle. Stress and sloth can wreak just as much havoc. Getting more sleep, moving around and eating well are all key factors for staving off the college blues.
[…] Small diet changes bring big results Except cellulite. Another rule of thumb for healthier restaurant questing is to pick places with fresher food.

The Mahler Project: Mahler 4
Friday-Sunday, Jan. 13-15
Gustavo Dudamel, the acclaimed, illustrious conductor and music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, loves Mahler.  So you can bet that the Mahler Project, Dudamel’s epic quest to perform the full symphonic cycle of the late-Romantic-era Austrian composer Gustav Mahler, will be worth seeing.
Mahler 4 will feature, logically enough, Mahler’s Symphony No. 4. Mahler’s first four works, nicknamed the “Wunderhorn suite,” are noted for being musical derivations of the classic German folk poetry collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn, or “The Youth’s Magic Horn.” Symphony No. 4 is particularly heralded for its thematic complexity, as it brings together spirituality and humor in a poignant, pensive search for the meaning of life.
Maybe more significantly, the opening program this weekend will feature two breathtaking vocal soloists: acclaimed Swedish soprano Miah Persson will perform in Symphony No. 4, and equally talented American baritone Thomas Hampson will be highlighted in Mahler’s “Songs of a Wayfarer.”
Oh, and did we mention that Dudamel will be conducting?
 
Milk Carton Kids
Thursday, Jan. 12
Got milk? Lactose intolerant or not, it’s time to indulge in the gloriousness of The Milk Carton Kids.
Most notable for harmonic hits like “New York” and “Undress the World,” The Milk Carton Kids find the perfect balance between heartfelt lyrics and delicate acoustic guitar sets.
In their top iTunes hit “Michigan,” for instance, the folk fantasy duo, consisting of Joey Ryan and Kenneth Pattengale, croon “Michigan’s in the rearview now/keep your hands where I can see em/you took the words right out of my mouth/when you knew that I would need em/what am I supposed to do now without you?” — a set of perfectly plain lyrics and yet they speak to listeners with their unabashed honesty.
The Milk Carton Kids are set to perform at Largo at the Coronet, located on La Cienaga Boulevard near the Beverly Center. Doors will open at 6 p.m., the show begins at 8 p.m. and tickets can be purchased on the Largo website.
If you don’t know them yet, act now. Guaranteed, they will become a folk force to be reckoned with.
FELA!
Now-Sunday, Jan. 22
If you have rhythm in your soul, if you can’t help but dance the night away, if singing is second nature then FELA! is the show for you.
Using original music from the dynamic afrobeat music legend Fela Anikulapo-Kuti himself, FELA! follows Kuti’s life and the creation of a new energized music sensation and genre.  The musical, however, is more than a mere superficial gaze at afrobeat — it also delves into the deeply rooted issue of the political corruptness of the military dictatorship of Nigeria and other African countries.
Accordingly, FELA! is both thought-provoking as well as fun and exuberant — the perfect theatrical hybrid.
Tickets can be purchased through the Center Theatre Group website, but you’ll have to act now, given that the show will be closing at the Ahmanson Theatre in a mere couple weeks.
With the new year comes new theatrical opportunities.
Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk:
Thursday, Jan 12.
It’s back! The Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk, held every second Thursday of each month, will continue on Jan. 12. The self-guided Art Walk features a venerable smorgasbord of exhibits at Downtown Los Angeles’ most notable galleries including Crewest, the REDCAT and even Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising’s fashion museum.
The Art Walk also highlights many treasured establishments — such as Cole’s French Dip — and will play host to numerous street vendors and food trucks. On top of all that, MCs Ninjasonik and Nat Bouknight will perform at the Art Walk lounge, where attendees will be able to relax and sample products while sipping on samples of coconut water.
It all adds up to a long evening of intriguing activities — a perfect respite from what was undoubtedly a cruel and grueling first week of classes. For more information, check out DowntownArtWalk.org, where you can look at all the participating establishments and even make a map of your personal trek through downtown’s streets.

Wim Wenders new 3-D dance documentary, Pina, is Germany’s official entry for the Academy Awards and, more importantly, a stunningly gorgeous film.
It is a strange sensation to watch a documentary in 3-D, though Pina isn’t the first of its kind.  For this movie’s purpose, however, the format works incredibly well.
Dancing queen · Pina, the German documentary commemorating the dancing and choreography of the legendary Pina Bausch, comes to life with its vivid imagery and captivating cinematography. The film is further enhanced by the lively 3-D screen, serving as a beautiful tribute to the legend herself. - Photo courtesy of IFC Films
The film is largely composed of numerous dance pieces choreographed by the film’s namesake, Pina Bausch, and uses technology beautifully to play up the depth of the stage and the spaces between the dancers — every movement of the dancers’ bodies is accentuated due to the subtle effect of the 3-D.
There is very little in the way of contextualizing any of the dances; Wenders gives the viewer almost no information about the history of the routines, the company or Bausch herself.
The film is much more a showcase of Bausch’s work than it is a portrait of her as a human being. Wenders never delves into Pina’s background, her life or her untimely death from cancer a mere five days after diagnosis and two days before the film was set to begin production.
Instead, the film largely cuts between striking footage of the dances she choreographed and interviews with the dancers in her company.
The most fascinating thing about these interviews, though, is that one never actually sees anyone speaking. Each of the dancers highlighted in the film merely sits in front of the camera pensively, making various facial expressions while the actual audio recordings of their interviews are used as a voiceover.
It’s an interesting take on the interview format, allowing the viewer to focus on the physical emotions of the people they’re viewing through the tiniest movements on their faces. This format is a testament to the fact that dancers make their livings with their bodies through the singular use of movement, thus showcasing Wenders’ clever directing skills.
Wenders also lets each of his interviewees speak in their native tongue, with subtitles in English displayed on the screen, thus highlighting the multicultural integration of the dance company as well as the idea that dance and Bausch’s expressive themes are universal.
Many of the routines in the film are set in outdoor locations: next to a busy street, in monorails, parks, railroad tunnels and abandoned buildings. These locations create a unique context for the dances and are much of the reason why the film is so beautiful.
These settings are Wenders’ main contribution to the dances and he creates several gorgeous compositions with various environments throughout Pina. The film incorporates natural elements into several of Bausch’s dances, even flooding the stage with water for one of the more spectacular pieces. The colors, in particular, are beautifully vivid: the blue sky, the blood-red dancer outfits and the surrounding greenery all contribute to a sense of wonder.
Wenders also employs several unique film techniques to show the dances in a way they could never be seen on stage. He cuts between the stage and other locations while the same dance takes place. Additionally, there is one routine in which he cuts between dancers of different ages doing the same movements in the same costumes, expertly portraying the passage of time and how the various levels of sensuality within the choreography are perceived at various stages of life.
Through the presentation of her choreography in the film, it becomes clear that Bausch was deeply interested in sex, nature, the elements, repetition, urgency, sorrow, fear, passion and the dynamic between men and women.
For instance, the film opens with the preparation for “The Rite of Spring,” with several dancers covering the floor of a stage that features a giant dirt square on which they perform. It’s an extremely simple and primal setting for a dance that largely communicates terror, lust and power — a dance in which each dancer naturally gets filthier and filthier as the performance progresses.
The film ends with a quote from Bausch herself: “Dance, dance, otherwise, we are lost.” These words seem to explain Bausch’s lifelong relationship with dance as something she was incapable of living without.
Wenders is clearly full of the same passion for both dance and film. Here, his collaboration with Bausch offers beautiful imagery through the combination of two mediums supremely and uniquely human, both deeply rooted in movement and emotion.

Like many other old school mediums, comic books are being forced to adapt to the digital age.
In the last year, comics have jumped onto the digital bandwagon rather than just awkwardly putting one foot in. The major companies have adopted day and date digital releases, meaning all readers get their issues at the same time. They have also moved much of their libraries to the digital market, and comic reading apps such as Comixology are growing in popularity.
It’s a smart move. Comic books have faced the same big problem that all markets face: piracy. Even with Warner Bros. and Disney backing big companies such as DC and Marvel, this is an industry without the studio support that usually backs films and television shows. Not to mention, comics are also facing the same slow decline in sales.
Until recently, comic book piracy was a simple, free alternative to buying a book. Now the producers are adjusting to the circumstances by offering great service packages, from bundled issues to same-day releases. The quality is great and sales are strong. This isn’t to say that digital is the end-all, be-all solution to the comic book industry’s problems, but it is a new avenue toward financial and popular success.
And if there’s one thing the industry needs, it’s new readers. Comic book shops are excellent, but they are restrained by their fixed location as opposed to the easy accessibility of the Internet. Accordingly, the demand for comics in a more accessible form is forcing companies to shift their focus from singular stores to digital outlets. Anyone interested in reading the further adventures of Iron Man or Batman after seeing the recent films can now, using the growing app market, get the latest issue.
But that’s the business side. What about the creative aspect? Are comic book companies taking the newspaper route by simply re-posting material to the digital world, or are they taking advantage of a new medium to find fresh spins on telling stories?
Even with the presence of big companies, comics are part of a creator-driven industry. Writers and artists drive trends and are responsible for the content. It’s an open world; the last two decades have brought in indie creators who worked on topics far beyond the bread and butter of superheroes and their capes. New ideas are constantly being adopted, and as the industry moves toward the digital field, it is bringing in ideas and models from trans-media movements.
A great example of what can be done with the digital medium is in Cognito Comics’ Operation Ajax. A historical thriller developed specifically for the iPad and adapted from Stephen Kinzer’s All the Shah’s Men: An American Coup and The Roots of Middle East Terror, it features moving panels, ambient sounds and most intriguingly, pop-ups of additional information for the reader’s choosing, including timelines, declassified documents and even archival footage of the people involved. It’s an innovative idea, and it makes for a captivating story. Operation Ajax was one of last year’s best releases in part because it created a world that drew the reader in.
This sort of thing isn’t new. In recent years, major companies tried their hands at motion comics with voice acting casts. DC put out a Watchmen motion comic concurrently with its big screen release, while Marvel has tried some big name titles such as Warren Ellis’ Iron Man: Extremis. However, these were seen as special releases and neither company really adopted multimedia elements with their digital releases.
What the comic book industry needs is to full-heartedly embrace those elements. Operation Ajax showed that it can be done and there is a whole world of opportunities that digital offers. Imagine in-page-pop-ups on Batman’s gadgets — Arkham Asylum-style — or being able to play the soundtracks Brian Wood and Ryan Kelly devised for each issue of their series, Local.
And the creators will continue to drive the style of their comics. Whether they are working for big name titles or crafting their indie masterpiece, they’ll just be using a new outlet. With the rise in tech start-ups and the continued growth of augmented reality and social apps, it’s easier with each passing day for comics to dominate the digital world. The only thing to hope for is that it catches on.
The digital medium isn’t the easy solution to the industry’s problems, but it’s a new canvas through which new readers can be brought in and new ways of telling stories can be found. And that makes it an exciting new frontier for everyone.

When you take a photograph, you don’t necessarily have to capture everything correctly the first time. From amateurs to  professional photographers,  plenty of technology exists that can make a photo more surreal and fantastical.
Modern man· Pierre Beteille plays with postmodernist artistic ideologies as he recreates his subject multiple times as the eggs in an egg carton, fusing the art of photoshop with an innovate conceptualization. - Photo courtesy of Annenberg Space for Photography
The Annenberg Space for Photography’s current exhibition, Digital Darkroom, explores the ways in which photographers utilize technology to create their pieces. From humorous to dramatic to visionary pieces, the works of the 17  artists are far from ordinary.
Digital Darkroom is not only a showcase of some of the best artists playing with the best technology, it’s also an in-depth exploration into a relevant question: Have technological advances in photo manipulation, such as Photoshop, changed fine art and photography for better or for worse?
Even if visitors don’t have a strong tie to either side, the exhibit compiles enough intriguing photography to keep any visitor’s curiosity piqued. Visitors armed with a map and 3-D glasses are left to roam the first few pieces and also sit down to watch a video. The short video introduces the artists in the show and the technology they use. One by one, the artists let viewers in on their artistic machinations. Viewers hear what inspires these artists and watch them in action behind a computer as they click away to create their edited works.
Yet despite the fact that they all share the commonality of sitting behind a screen to create their works, the artists of Digital Darkroom are stylistically diverse.
The jokester of the group is Pierre Beteille, an artist who confesses he isn’t a good photographer and doesn’t like to explain the meanings of his works. Beteille takes simple photographs of himself in his home and then uses his computer to insert a nugget of comedy here and there. His piece “Me, me, me, me, me … and me!” is a photograph of his face in different expressions set up as eggs in a carton. It’s not a complicated idea but it’s immediately amusing.
In another photograph titled “Waiting For Holidays #3,” Beteille is seen in front of an ocean holding what seems to be a surfboard but upon a closer look is actually an ironing board.
Martine Roch’s pieces are also humorous but less overtly silly. The artist places animal heads onto human bodies, similar to those strange dogs with human hands that appeared on Sesame Street, which were inspired by William Wegman’s photographs. Roch, however, doesn’t only use dogs and tries to capture the expressions in her chosen animals’ eyes and match that emotion to a human body. The resulting photographs are funny but crafty.
The artist expertly pairs animal and human bodies in pieces such as “The Delicate Lady,” a photograph of a rabbit in a dress. The dress makes sense with the face and the body of the animal; the animal’s face and neck mesh seamlessly with the rest of the body. Somehow these animal-human hybrids seem to fit right into reality.
In fact, many of the artists’ works either attempted to redefine reality or create something completely different.
Brooke Shaden’s works are her attempt to recreate different scenes from her imagination. Shaden is the youngest in the group but her talent is evident; the subdued colors and eerie settings of the pieces evoke the mental image of a disturbed fairyland. “Sleepwalker” shows a woman from the top, her hair loose and her hands grasping her face. The photograph is especially stunning because of its emotional content but also because it could be perceived as either a photograph or a painting; the colors, texture and background make the work both dark and alluring.
The 3-D section of the exhibition also presents a range of aesthetic inspirations. Fittingly, the 3-D video picks the brains of the artist and explores the history of 3-D photography.
Mike Pucher’s photos of flowers beautifully magnify the delicacy of his chosen subjects while Christopher Schneberger’s historically inspired, creepy works shed light on old tales. Schneberger’s photos illuminate how 3-D technology could also help portray the supernatural -— save for a few, his photographs are effectively captivating and chilling, and at times the scenes seem almost real.
Overall, the 3-D and non-3-D showcases mix well because they explore how much a photograph, even when tweaked with technology, can approximate reality.
In this aspect, Digital Darkroom leaves it up to the viewer to answer the question of where photography and reality meet and whether technology is elevating photography as an art form. Though the exhibition seems to suggest that advanced technology can produce great artwork, the answer is ultimately in the eye of the beholder.

You’re sitting at a table, idly watching a pencil spin between your index finger and thumb. The drone of some TV show is streaming on your laptop screen, but you’re not paying attention. Papers with unknown titles, numbers and pictures are strewn in front of you. You’re not paying attention to those either. You rub your eyes. You sigh.
You decide to compromise to save yourself time and stress. You type “SparkNotes,” “GradeSaver” or “GradeBuddy” into your address bar. Though SparkNotes is commonly known, GradeSaver and GradeBuddy are the new kids on the block. GradeSaver charges for in-depth summaries, reviews and essays. GradeBuddy, on the other hand, departs from study guides about course materials and instead offers day-to-day lecture notes and detailed study guides for tests that can be bought with just a click of the mouse.
For years, teachers have cautioned against these kind of shortcuts, the academic equivalent of fool’s gold highways: websites that provide free study guides or summaries of canonical reading. Incredibly easy to find and access on the Internet, such websites bypass the paralyzing and overwhelming path of required reading and actual attendance.
The presence and popularity of these websites raises two questions: Are SparkNotes and its peers useful, and are they ethical to use in the first place?
SparkNotes and the like are widely used for good reason: They work. They do their job, which is helping students squeeze out the most content in the least amount of time. For instance, SparkNotes condenses the verbose language of the 500-page Great Expectations by Charles Dickens to a list of one- or two-paragraph chapter summaries.
The ethical viability of the websites is a trickier issue. It depends on how we, the students, use them.
Students who have used such websites know the feeling of getting a decent grade on a test without much preparation or personal effort. You feel a rush. You feel as if you cheated the system. You did not read the book, yet you find yourself doing as well as someone who did.
You are rewarded for your lack of preparation without facing any consequences. Sure, it’s not as good as actually reading the book, but how could reading a summary not be at least slightly useful? With limited time, isn’t reading a summary better than not reading at all?
Beyond using these websites as a crutch before daunting tests, students could also use them as supplementary resources. Even if you have your own lecture notes, another perspective never hurts. It might be revolutionary to consider such websites a “perspective,” but that’s what they are — sources that can reinforce and even improve upon what one has already learned.
SparkNotes and GradeSaver offer free study guides.
Still, some websites, like GradeBuddy, charge money. At a cost of $1.99 for a day’s lecture notes, or $29.99 for a course packet over an entire semester, GradeBuddy and its peers are not free sources, making them less accessible to some students.
But who are we kidding? An equal playing field never existed in the first place. Everyone will always have different resources and different levels of access.
By this point in their lives, college students should be comfortable with the idea that in life, money does translate into more and better opportunities. Our very enrollment in USC reaffirms that idea.
Remember taking the SATs? The test was supposed to make it easier for colleges to judge us fairly, but at the end of the day, some of us bought Kaplan books; others took entire classes for the purpose of doing well.
Moreover, these websites aren’t selling anything that isn’t already being sold. As a basic principle, GradeBuddy isn’t any different from a private service that charges students for tutoring. Both operate as a supplementary resource for students who need something extra to get them through a paper or test. There is a stigma attached to these websites, and it needs to be erased.

Ideology aside, I can see why many Americans find Rick Santorum relatable. He presents himself as the underdog. He wears a sweater vest. He called himself the candidate you’d bring home to mom.
But a close look at his statements should frighten anyone who values education. On Jan. 10, Santorum called President Barack Obama an elitist snob. Why? Because Santorum believes that, if Obama had his way, every American child would go to college.
His assertion is just the latest example of anti-intellectualism in American politics. For too long, we have written off cerebral politicians as cold and untrustworthy, only to be charmed by the candidate most frequently photographed wearing a pair of cowboy boots.
But you can’t fix the economy with a smile. It’s time to see intellect as a necessity in our leaders.
First of all, let’s make the distinction between intellect and cleverness. Former president George W. Bush was clever. During his campaigns, he frequently dodged attacks by turning them into compliments.
Intellect, however, is about having a thirst for knowledge. Intellectuals think critically, as we’re repeatedly told to do in our classes.
It’s unfortunate that many Americans see intellect as a sign of elitism. True intellect encourages the opposite: the exploration of new ideas, and the willingness to admit when one might be wrong.
In part, anti-intellectualism is driven by the idea that smart people are inherently unlikeable. It’s an assumption present throughout pop culture: From Lisa Simpson to Sheldon Cooper, no one likes the nerd.
Pop culture aside, though, anti-intellectualism does have deeper roots. Obama holds degrees from Columbia University and Harvard Law School; the educational opportunities that were available to him still aren’t available to most Americans.
Although intellect has little to do with where one went to school, the connection between intellectualism and exclusive institutions is hard to shake.
That’s why former president Bill Clinton emphasized his small-town Arkansas roots over his time at Georgetown University. Did the latter prepare him for the presidency? Probably. Would it have helped him in the polls? Probably not.
Ironically, then, one of the best ways to combat anti-intellectualism is to improve access to education. A well-functioning public school system that encourages more Americans to exercise their minds would make brainy candidates seem less alien.
On the other end, elite education institutions should — well — tone down the elitism. They should do their best to open themselves up to the public.
The intellectuals in politics aren’t always going to be able to work a crowd. Still, as symbolic as many political positions are, leading isn’t always about looking good on stage.
Sorry, Santorum: sometimes, a degree does make you more qualified.

Governments point to problems and say that the populace is helpless against them, that only government can solve the problems – this is a logical fallacy because the governments are comprised of the people. Governments are powerless to solve problems unless the people can also solve them.
Reasons to avoid substance in campaigning (in America today):
1. Voters who disagree with SOMETHING you said are more likely to vote against you than voters who agree with it are to vote FOR you.
2. Anything you said you favored that doesn’t happen during your tenure can become a broken campaign promise.
3. Any position you express is subject to criticism for “insensitivity” by anyone whose racial/ethnic background could possibly sustain offense at the way you expressed it. Insensitivity invariably trumps not only substance but even other, concurrent SENSITIVITIES on the candidate’s part.
Just wear cowboy boots and smile. GOOD article, as always from Maya Itah!

As we settle into the spring semester, the most obvious difference upon our return to campus is the absence of so many of our classmates, lured away by the excitement of the enticing study abroad opportunity. Those of us remaining on campus are left staring at the cartoon, poof-like Facebook updates proclaiming our peers’ departures to London, Sydney or Madrid. We’re happy for them, if not slightly envious of all the unforgettable life experiences they’re surely about to have that we somehow can’t get in Los Angeles.

Studying abroad has long been held up as a crucial, once-in-a-lifetime experience, one of those make-the-most-of-your-time-here -at-college things.
Except you’re not here. The inescapable flipside of studying abroad is that while you’re choosing from the limited selection of classes you can take in Barcelona, you’re skipping one of your precious semesters at USC. Everyone knows the value and the novelty of travel, but consider what you’re missing — athletic events, fraternity formals, the chance to take the classes you really want, and Coachella.
On top of subtracting four months from your time on campus, it’s nearly impossible to take your traditional course load at a foreign university because aside from almost all courses appearing as only credit/no credit, you can’t take any general education, writing or diversity requirements. This means aspiring dual-degree students might have to make the choice between travel and their second major or minor, and even students with moderate course loads could find it difficult to graduate on time. But we still want to travel because we like adventure, accents and new food, because we want to say we did it and because we’re young.
To that end, I’d like to shed light on an oft-overlooked and infinitely more manageable alternative to studying abroad: interning abroad in the summer.
Entering college, I always assumed I’d study abroad. Eventually, however, I remembered I was going for three degrees in four years.
I also wanted to spend spring semester of junior year, the unofficial yet no less traditional “study abroad semester,” doing directed research. New Zealand wasn’t in the cards, and it’s not for a lot of people. Then I learned about the intern programs.
Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Marshall School of Business and a host of other schools offer summer internship programs abroad; you apply to your choice of location and, once accepted, work with the faculty to land an internship that suits you. And aside from simply being more productive, interning abroad means you’ll spend a summer working in the field of something you love rather than a spring sitting through lectures.
There is no downside. You have your time abroad — often alongside your friends. It also looks better on your résumé and you gain practical work experience.
Meanwhile, you don’t fall behind academically, you don’t miss any time at USC and when a potential employer calls the number you gave as a reference, they’ll reach someone with a very impressive accent. There are even scholarships available to help offset the cost, which, over the course of two months instead of four, almost certainly cost less than studying abroad would cost in the first place.
Many of you will spend the summer interning anyway. Why not do it in Dublin?

As a college student, USC alumnus and singer-songwriter Kina Grannis  said she used to claim a spot in the stairwells of the New North dorms and Troy East apartments to practice. Now Jimmy Kimmel will be welcoming her to his stage on Jan. 12.
This will not be her first appearance on television screens across the country. When Grannis won the Doritos Crash the Super Bowl contest in 2008, millions of Super Bowl viewers saw her video for “Message from Your Heart” during a commercial break.
Since then, Grannis has grown in popularity as an independent artist, leaving Interscope Records in her past.
Her latest music video for her song In Your Arms received over 4 million views on YouTube and caught the attention of people like Ellen DeGeneres. It is a very innovative stop-motion video made out of jellybeans – 288,000 jellybeans to be exact.
The production time for the video was predicted to take one month, but ended up lasting almost two years. “In Your Arms” landed the number 20 spot on VH1’s Top 20 Countdown this past Sunday.
Grannis is now preparing to travel to the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and other countries for an international tour throughout February. Catch her on Jimmy Kimmel Live! this Thursday night on ABC.

The Directors Guild of America has announced their nominees  for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film for 2011.
The list of nominees includes several expected names, including Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist), Alexander Payne (The Descendants) and Martin Scorsese (Hugo), as well as some surprises, such as Woody Allen (Midnight in Paris) and David Fincher (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo).
Their nominations have tightened up the race to the Oscars. The only director being recognized for the first time is Michel Hazanavicius, whereas the other filmmakers are all veterans, having either been nominated or winners in previous years.
The surprising omission includes Steven Spielberg, who was snubbed for his directorial efforts in War Horse. Terrence Malick, who has been overlooked all year for his breathtaking film, The Tree of Life, was also left unacknowledged, lessening his chances for future ceremonies.
The DGA awards are a good indicator of who will go on to win the Best Director Oscar. There have only been six instances since its inception in 1948 when a winner of the DGA award hasn’t also won the corresponding Best Director Oscar.
The winner will be awarded at the 64th Annual DGA Awards Dinner on Saturday, January 28, 2012 at the Grand Ballroom at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.
