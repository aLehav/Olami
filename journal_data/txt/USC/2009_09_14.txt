The story: After finding itself in an unfamiliar deficit heading into the fourth quarter, USC charged back against Ohio State in an emotional 18-15 win that came down to the final seconds.
Down 15-10 and 86 yards from the goal line, the Matt Barkley-led Trojan offense completed a 14-play drive, culminating in a two-yard Stafon Johnson touchdown run in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.

Barkley, a true freshman, kept his composure on the decisive drive, completing three of five passes for 55 yards. Some of his best plays came when he got the ball into junior running back Joe McKnight’s hands. McKnight rushed for 30 yards on five carries during the drive and also caught a 21-yard pass.
Once near the goal line, Johnson relieved McKnight, taking a handoff and sprinting to the right corner of the endzone, where he high-stepped in untouched for the go-ahead score. USC converted the two-point conversion on a Barkley pass to McKnight to take the lead for good.
The game-winning drive provided the Trojans’ only points of the second half.
Ohio State dominated the field position battle, beginning three second-half drives in USC territory. The Trojan defense kept USC in the game, stymying the Buckeyes and allowing them only three second-half points.
Play that changed the game: Barkley’s 21-yard pass to McKnight.
Barkley’s pass came on the third play of its game-winning drive. Barkley was sacked on the first play and a false start penalty took the Trojans back. After a McKnight run, the Trojans were faced with a 3rd down and eight from their own 16-yard line and appeared to be in trouble.
Barkley dropped back to pass and found an open McKnight a few yards past the line of scrimmage. McKnight beat an Ohio State linebacker to the inside on an option route and sprinted up the field after he caught Barkley’s pass.
The pass gave USC’s offense much-needed breathing room as well as game-altering momentum. Everything seemed to start clicking as the Trojans put together their longest scoring drive of the game by far.
Most valuable player: Matt Barkley.
Although the youngster’s numbers weren’t amazing — 15 of 31, 195 yards, one interception and no touchdowns — the poise with which he carried himself on USC’s final drive could not be captured in the stat sheet.
The roaring Ohio State crowd didn’t seem to faze him. Neither did the interception he threw in the first half to the Buckeyes’ Ross Homan. His teammates said his demeanor remained the same throughout the entire game.
“Matt was the same person the whole game,” McKnight said. “[He] never lost his composure, [he] just kept coming in the huddle and calling plays.”
Coach Pete Carroll was impressed as usual with his 19-year-old sensation.
“It’s just remarkable that he can show all that so early,” Carroll said. “But he showed also that he can take you and win in the fourth quarter, which is huge.”
Stat of the game: 106,033.
The number of fans on hand at “The Horseshoe,” a new attendance record for Ohio Stadium. The jam-packed crowd hardly sat down the entire night and was at its loudest when the game was on the line.
“It was 100 guys versus everyone in the world it seemed like,” Carroll said.
But the Trojans remained unfazed despite the noise.
“It was pretty loud, not gonna lie,” Barkley said. “I think my ears are still ringing a little bit. But I mean we played through it. The actual noise didn’t affect how we were going to play.”
Quote of the game: “The questions that everybody has been asking about Matt [are] legitimate… All we can tell you is the guy’s really special. He’s into it, he’s having fun, he’s not arrogant, he’s not cocky — he’s just a complete ball player.”
— Carroll about Barkley’s ability to handle big-game situations.
On track into the Pac: After surviving their biggest non-conference test of the season, the Trojans are in prime shape entering their Pac-10 schedule, which starts next week at Washington.
But seeing as their only loss in 2008 came against conference opponent Oregon State — the game following the Ohio State matchup ­— Carroll said he already warned his team to not get caught up in the celebration and overlook the Huskies.
“I already addressed it,” Carroll said. “This game can’t carry into the next week. This game’s over. I told them, ‘It’s already on ESPN, they already showed the highlights to everybody, so that’ll be over by the time we get home.’”

Thousands of people poured into the Galen Center on Saturday decked in Cardinal and Gold, but they weren’t going to see a USC basketball game.
Instead, the 7,500 people who attended the ESPN viewing this Saturday saw a historic college football game — in three dimensions.
Alternate viewing · Wearing special glasses, a few of the more than 7,000 fans cheer wildly at the Galen Center while watching USC’s nail-biting 18-15 win in a pilot three-dimensional telecast produced by ESPN. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan
With the Trojans in Columbus, Ohio, for their highly anticipated matchup with the No. 8 Ohio State Buckeyes, many faithful Trojan fans were looking for a way to experience the game without actually making the trip to Ohio Stadium. ESPN gave Trojans fans just that, as the Galen Center saw the first-ever broadcast of a college football game in RealD, which has been used in the past for movies such as Monsters vs. Aliens and the recent X-Games 3-D: The Movie.
The RealD experience is not what one might expect from a 3-D broadcast. Instead of images popping out of the screen, the feed — combined with special glasses which look much like the classic wayfarers of RayBan fame — create the illusion of depth, which provides a much more realistic viewing experience.
The Galen Center’s broadcast was not the only place to see the game in 3-D this weekend, as ESPN set up six other broadcast areas around the country, including the theater at L.A. Live.
The game experience seemed so realistic that fans might confuse the atmosphere for that of the Coliseum. The crowd shouted when the Buckeyes had the ball, and hushed when the Trojans drove on offense. They jeered whenever a Buckeye was even mentioned or shown on screen.
By halftime, with the score tied at 10, many were impressed by the 3-D viewing experience.
Jared Greiner, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment, was among those enjoying the broadcast enough to stay for the remainder of the game.
“It’s very cool, I’m glad I came,” Greiner said at halftime of the game. “I wasn’t planning on staying for the whole game, but I think I will now. As long as the game stays close.”
But Greiner, along with most of the crowd, was somewhat confused about how it all worked. Ed Cunningham, who joined Bob Davie and Mark Jones as the specialized broadcast team for the 3-D feed, had some explanation early in the first quarter.
“Two images are being pumped out into the [Galen Center], just like your eyes,” Cunningham said. “The game is shot at a little different angle than you’re used to seeing. It’s like a stop sign, from a distance it doesn’t look like it has much dimension, but as you get closer, there is more dimension to it.”
The crowd never seemed to care much for the real engineering behind the extravaganza, though. They only cared about the game.
As the game came down to the final minutes, the crowd was treated to the most realistic viewing experience they could have had without being at Ohio Stadium. When freshman quarterback Matt Barkley led the Trojans to the final scoring drive of the game, all of his passes were seen in three dimensions, as were all of junior Joe McKnight’s game-changing runs.
At the end of the night, the fans were asked to return their glasses in recycling bins to be reused, likely for one of the various 3-D movies that were previewed during commercial breaks. Because the game was so exhilirating, it was unclear how much the 3-D angles contributed to the fans’ post-game elation.

Matt Barkley has officially relinquished the title of freshman.
With the game on the line in just his second collegiate game, in front of perhaps the loudest crowd he will ever face, Barkley’s play was not that of a teenager.
Cool under fire · Freshman Matt Barkley (7), seen here pitching the ball to Stafon Johnson (13), passed the first major test of his college career by keeping his composure. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
His numbers weren’t spectacular. His missed opportunities were plenty. But for the defining drive that spanned just over six minutes at the end of the fourth quarter, a kid days removed from his 19th birthday stood up in front of 106,033 screaming fans and somehow wasn’t fazed.
With USC down 15-10 in the fourth quarter, the ear-splitting Ohio State crowd could taste the victory. The USC offense had been spotty all night. One more stall would have been the nail in the coffin for the Trojans.
Enter Barkley, a kid who didn’t know he was supposed to play one.
Cool as can be, Barkley led a 14-play, 86-yard drive that culminated in a two-yard Stafon Johnson touchdown run. The resulting sound was the best thing Barkley could have hoped for:
Golden silence.
Was there ever any doubt? Not to this hotshot freshman.
“I knew our offense was going to score,” Barkley said.
Really? Because I’d wager that every USC fan was devouring their fingernails by that point in the game.
Until Barkley’s miraculous drive, the Buckeyes’ defense had been shutting down the Trojans all night. USC’s only touchdown was a gimme, set up by a Chris Galippo interception that he returned to the Ohio State two-yard line. The offense couldn’t seem to get anything going in the second half, finding itself continually stuffed drive after drive.
Before Barkley led them out of the darkness, the Trojans’ first four second-half drives broke down like this:
Three-and-out, punt.
Bad snap over punter Billy O’Malley’s head, safety.
Eight plays, punt.
Three-and-out, punt.
Then out of nowhere, Barkley orchestrated the game-winning drive with the poise and grace of a 10th-year senior.
When the Buckeyes blitzed, he made the right choice and took the sack. When their coverage held, he checked down to the right receiver. And when the crowd noise intensified, he brushed it off like he couldn’t hear it.
“We played through it,” Barkley said of the crowd, which was deafening at best. “The actual noise didn’t affect how we were going to play.”
In the huddle, he was a leader, his youth making no difference to the 10 pairs of eyes looking to him to lead them to a victory.
“Matt was the same person the whole game,” junior running back Joe McKnight said. “[He] never lost his composure, just kept coming in the huddle and calling plays.”
In an environment when most seasoned college quarterbacks would have folded, Barkley never looked shaken, never looked rattled. Even after a first-half interception, when he threw the ball across his body and it was picked off by Ohio State’s Ross Homan, Barkley just shook it off.
“He’s not an 18-year-old kid anymore,” McKnight said.
Right, he’s 19 now, but I don’t think that’s what McKnight meant.
“He stepped up to be a man,” McKnight continued. “[He] made big plays at big times and he’s going to take us to the promised land.”
Even though Barkley set foot on the USC campus as a student for the very first time eight months ago, this moment was not as outlandish to him as it seemed to the rest of us.
Being the starter, leading this team in the most hostile of environments, was just how he knew it would unfold.
“This is what it’s supposed to be,” he said. “This is what I came here for.”
Barkley does not seem to notice how different he is. The fact, however, is not lost on coach Pete Carroll.
“All we can tell you is the guy’s really special,” Carroll said. “He’s into it, he’s having fun, he’s not arrogant, he’s not cocky  — he’s just a complete ball player.”
According to Carroll, there was not one particular moment when Barkley proved that he would be ready for situations of this magnitude. To the contrary, there just never was a moment that proved he wasn’t.
“There’s been no indication otherwise,” Carroll said. “I’m talking from spring football, from day one, for real he can handle it unlike anyone we’ve seen.”
Back in spring, Barkley was asked almost jokingly if he’d be confident starting against Ohio State. He was just as confident then as he is now, and now that it’s all come to pass, he recognized its dreamlike quality.
“It is kind of surreal but at the same time, it’s what I wanted, its what I’ve always wanted,” Barkley said.
Believe me kid, it’s surreal for everybody else too.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Matt Barkley heard it all Saturday night, but it was the final sound that rang sweetest.
The thumping drumbeat of the Ohio State band and verbal assaults had pelted his eardrums all day. His ears were ringing and his receivers could hardly hear his instructions.
Galloping glory · Running back Stafon Johnson high steps into the end zone for a two-yard touchdown run to cap the fourth-quarter drive that gave the Trojans the go-ahead score. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
But the true freshman quarterback shook off the noise and the familiar scenario of a long field ahead to spark USC (2-0) on a 14-play, 86-yard drive that would prove to be the difference in the Trojans’ 18-15 comeback win against Ohio State (1-1) in Ohio Stadium.
USC’s offense had struggled all night after consistently being dealt bad starting field positions. But even after a sack and a penalty that put the Trojans at their own five- yard line on 2nd down and 19, Barkley had no doubts about what the final outcome would be.
“I knew our offense was going to score,” said Barkley, who finished 15 of 31 for 195 yards. “When we punched it in, it was good to hear that silence.”
Running back Joe McKnight was a frequent aid to his quarterback on the game’s defining drive. The junior from River Ridge, La., caught a pass from Barkley on an option route and weaved his way downfield for 21 yards. His three side-stepping runs later in the drive put the offense inside the Ohio State 10-yard line, where senior tailback Stafon Johnson later punched in a two-yard touchdown.
On the two-point conversion, McKnight caught a swing pass and barreled into the end zone to put USC up by three.
Despite mentioning that it was one of the few close contests he has experienced coaching college football, USC coach Pete Carroll mirrored his star quarterback’s confidence after the game.
“We didn’t think we were going to lose at any time,” Carroll said. “We just had to find our way.”
The Trojans rallied late in the first half to overcome a flat start, hitting a short field goal to tie the game at 10-10 heading into halftime. But USC’s errors continued to mount in the second half.
A snap to redshirt junior punter Billy O’Malley sailed over his outstretched arms and into the back of the end zone for a safety on USC’s second drive of the third quarter. The short field the Buckeyes started with on the next possession set them up for a 22-yard field goal, although the USC defense held its position on a goal line stance.
With the Trojans still down five points after two unsuccessful drives, Johnson’s dancing jaunt into the end zone where the majority of the USC fans were sitting provided the relief that the Trojans’ offense had been searching for all night.
Barkley was off the mark on several of his early throws, but all his teammates took out of the game was his last march.
Linebacker redshirt sophomore Chris Galippo ranked the performance among the best drives that former USC quarterbacks Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez had produced.
“I don’t know if any of them could have done it better,” Galippo said. “Matt really stepped up and proved he’s the man.”
The drive came in the face of a record crowd of more than 106,000 people who packed into the stadium for the primetime game. Ohio State’s band thumped The White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army” throughout the game as scarlet-clad fans bounced up and down.
But the Trojans joined in on the fun when the USC sideline also began to hop around to the song, which led the raucous crowd to respond with a wave of booing.
“It was 100 guys versus everybody in the world, it seemed like. I hope people don’t see that as disrespectful,” Carroll said. “We were just trying to have fun and keep the fires burning on our sideline. We needed every single guy jumping the whole time to do what we did today.”
A handful of coaches and players gave their own renditions of “Seven Nation Army” in the locker room after the game, with some just mimicking the beat. But as a song whose lyrics are centered around fighting back, it quickly became the team’s unofficial anthem for the night.
“It’s a win we’re going to cherish,” Carroll said, “because it was as difficult as it could get.”

Few words mean less today than “genius,” which casual overuse has seriously devalued over time. Like “brilliant” and “awesome,” “genius” is cheap praise, and too often it is mistaken for simple intelligence. That’s why I humphed noisily and rolled my eyes when I overheard some woman say that the man whose performance we were about to see — one Rinde Eckert — was indeed “a genius.”
Honey, there ain’t no such thing.
Mastermind · Rinde Eckert reprises his Obie Award-winning role of Nathan, a brilliant piano tuner trying to finish his operatic adaptation of Moby Dick before he loses his mind, in And God Created Great Whales. Singer and actress Nora Cole also reprises her role as Nathan’s muse. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Or is there? In less than 80 minutes, Eckert makes a frightfully compelling case. Some have powers of mind; others have ones of body. Eckert, miraculously, was gifted with both. It is a rare privilege to behold.
Eckert’s And God Created Great Whales, which was shown Thursday and Friday at the wonderfully dilapidated 24th Street Theatre, is the highest kind of performance art — crazily ambitious, deeply felt and occasionally sublime. But mostly, it’s ineffable. Words are rarely enough.
Eckert plays Nathan, an aging piano tuner trying desperately to finish a colossal undertaking — turn Herman Melville’s notoriously stylized novel Moby Dick into an opera — before his diseased mind goes blank forever. Nathan wakes up every morning at his old piano with fewer and fewer memories, but surrounded by color-coded tape recorders, notebooks, scores, flash cards and sticky notes. With these objects, he is able to piece together his life and continue writing the opera.
To inspire his creative efforts, as well as to keep him from permanently going under, Nathan enlists the help of a muse (Nora Cole). Of course, this muse, as Nathan’s own tape-recorded voice tells him each morning, is the product of Nathan’s deranged imagination made in the image of his lifelong love, famous opera singer Olivia Walsh. The muse carries the plot — both of the show and of Nathan’s opera — constantly getting Nathan back on track as his seagoing mind begins to wander to strange places.
Each day is an uphill battle against time. Nathan completes less and less of his work as his condition worsens. Sometimes, he even has to relearn how to speak. His muse is his rock, anchoring him to an increasingly precarious reality. But as Nathan goes, she goes. Time, like Melville’s great white whale, is relentless.
Eckert’s performance — think of an operatic John Malkovich, with resonances of Russell Crowe’s Professor Nash from A Beautiful Mind — nearly engulfs the room, even in his quieter moments. He can convey great feeling with the simplest gesture; no stagy facial exaggerations here. Elation is but a smile; longing, but one far-off glance. And when he sings — whether in rich baritone, arms fully extended, or vulnerable falsetto, hunched painfully over — nothing can stop him.
In perhaps an even greater feat, Cole matches Eckert’s incandescence. Had she been a lesser performer, the show would not have worked, for Eckert and Cole play essentially the same inseparable person, but they are also — and crucially — worlds apart. She is the lighthouse to his ship, the shore to his sea. Neither can exist without the other.
Cole plays her opera diva to perfection. Heaven’s gates are flung wide when she opens her mouth. With piercing vibrato, and inhumanly high notes, she does the Muses proud.
If it’s possible, Eckert and Cole are even better together, which is as it should be. Weak harmonization often spoils great productions; not so with these world-class artists. Theirs is effortless.
Eckert’s script is beautifully written, carrying with it a feeling of incompletion that mirrors Nathan’s own state of mind. Big ideas like madness, memory and mortality are treated seriously, but never didactically. But it isn’t all weighty stuff. Lighter moments — Cole has an especial gift for comedy — are served up in near-equal measure, as when Cole plays the various street vendors selling whale-bone corsets and shark-tooth earrings.
The stage design, like David Schweizer’s direction, gives us only the bare necessities, and to great effect. Everything — the muse’s perch of old boxes and Nathan’s piano — are held in place with rope, giving the stage a ship-like feel. The backdrop, a billowy white sheet, can, with Kathi O’Donohue’s basic lighting, be either a blood-stained sea or a cool-blue sky.
In the end, few shows are as good and few men are as visionary as And God Created Great Whales and Eckert.
“Consciousness is what defines genius,” writes prominent literary critic Harold Bloom.
Genius, in other words, expands man’s collective mind, and brings it to unfathomable places. Eckert proves Bloom right.

It takes a confused director to make a film like I Can Do Bad All By Myself. Tyler Perry, who is the world’s most bankable drag queen as the legendary and legendarily crass old woman Madea, seems to be just that type of person.
Perry, the famous filmmaker whose review-proof films are consistent hits within black communities, lacks the mature sensibilities to prevent his film from quickly devolving into a mess of potent melodrama, music and comedy. Perry got his start on stage, however, and his theatrical sensibilities essentially make up for the tonal jumpiness of I Can Do Bad All By Myself.

His latest film concerns a selfish young lounge singer named April, played by the effervescent Taraji P. Henson, who finds herself stuck with the three children of her deceased sister after their grandmother goes missing.
April eventually finds herself roadblocked by a number of decisions about what to do with the kids, as well as being forced to choose between Colombian immigrant Sandino (Adam Rodriguez), who skews somewhere between saint-nice and serial killer-nice, and philandering sociopath Randy (Brian White), who goes over-the-top in the opposite direction.
It is to the credit of Perry and Henson that April maintains an aloof attitude toward the entire melodramatic plot, remaining cold and sarcastic toward Sandino and her charges for much longer than most films could hold out without a change of heart.
The story is set in motion by a break-in at the home of Madea, a plot point which inspired the shameless riff on the classic poster for Sam Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs. The defiant old woman and her housemate Uncle Joe (also Perry) catch the children, and comedy mostly involving Madea threatening the defiant kids ensues. Using Madea in such a melodramatic movie is a sometimes-careless waltz with comedy that cheapens some excellent dramatic acting by the other principles.
Madea, who has been around since the early ’90s, is wearing out her welcome among some of Perry’s constituents, but for a neophyte she is a genuinely entertaining character. But I Can Do Bad All By Myself is not really Madea’s movie, and she eventually disappears from the scene altogether so Perry can focus on his melodramatic and musical elements a little more lucidly.
I Can Do Bad All By Myself is simultaneously a musical film featuring only lounge and gospel performances. Perry deftly displays his experience in theater and films in all the musical performances with a sure hand. Each song is used effectively to show character development, particularly within April, which lends the scenes of emotional transformation a deeper power that mere dialogue simply cannot convey.
Performing a cool opening number, Henson acquits herself nicely amongst the likes of Gladys Knight and real-life Detroit pastor Marvin Winans, but the real showstopper is Mary J. Blige. The hip-hop legend brings down the house performing the soulful “I Can Do Bad,” (which she co-wrote), which is the film’s unsurpassable high note.
I Can Do Bad All By Myself spreads itself very thin between several genres, and as such it is painted in mostly broad strokes. The last 30 minutes in particular are comprised of one emotional explosion after another, until eventually the audience finds itself in either laughter or tears. Naturally, the best part of I Can Do Bad All By Myself  — other than Mary J. Blige’s singing voice — is the subtle moments found in between all the drama. A prime example is how April’s teenage niece, played by the wonderful young actress Hope Olaide Wilson, expresses her frustration over being forced to grow up so fast. Many of the actors in this film, not the least of whom is Henson, reveal a great amount of depth behind their eyes when they aren’t caught up in the theatricality of it all.
The film’s ending is the broadest stroke of all, one inappropriate for the 30 minutes of melodrama that precede it, yet simultaneously one befitting the film’s musical sensibilities. You can stay for the credits to see some bloopers, mostly of Madea’s scenes, which are amusing solely because they reveal quite an ego behind the director, who also has the gall to give himself first-billing.
But Perry is a bona fide phenomenon, a grand showman who knows just how to create characters in true moral and emotional distress, usually within the urban setting that reflects his own difficult childhood in the inner city of Atlanta. It is said that his movies just don’t resonate with younger black audiences, and maybe the soapy qualities of his plots aren’t helping. Yet for its scenes of complex emotion, its moments about the power of music and, especially for Henson, I Can Do Bad All By Myself is a worthwhile film for anyone who doesn’t mind an overload of theatricality.

When a number of people are confined to the same workspace, the office rumor mill starts churning out gossip at a rate that puts professional blabbermouths like Perez Hilton to shame.
While the gossip is occasionally made up of harmless, passing comments like, “Oh dear God, did you see what so-and-so wore to that meeting?” the office buzz tends to be much more bizarre than that.
And, for whatever reason, the gossip in a law firm — mine in particular — is especially juicy.  Maybe it’s the high-strung attorneys hyped up on excessively caffeinated java or a few bored secretaries who oh-so-enjoy stirring the proverbial pot. The only thing that’s certain is that the combination of colorful personalities generates water cooler conversation so enthralling that it brings co-workers back time and time again to refill their ridiculously impractical cone-shaped cups.
One secretary — who my co-workers nicknamed “Brit Brit” in (dis)honor of tabloid train wreck, sometime-pop sensation, Britney Spears — was the source of the office’s most entertaining rumors.
It all began with Brit Brit coming into work and picking at the blisters on her palms that resulted from a bout of scabies. She then began putting her contagious paws on the copy machine, the fax machine, the filing cabinets, the printer — no office equipment was spared. Needless to say, many of the other secretaries were disgusted by her unsanitary indiscretion and decided to approach the human resources manager in hopes of preventing an office epidemic.
When human resources came to Brit Brit, she reacted in typical Brit Brit fashion. Suddenly, she no longer had scabies. What then, you might ask, were the festering sores on her hands? Maybe she chalked it up to a heat rash (it was December) or calluses from too much weightlifting, but her matronly shape rules out any possibility of this being the case. We never did get a straight answer on that one.
Against all odds, Brit Brit was proposed to during the 2008 holiday season. Like so many brides-to-be, she walked around flaunting her new ice for all of the office — or at least the ones who could muster up a few minutes of feigned excitement — to fawn over.
By the time spring rolled around, she added another ring to that scabies-ridden finger of hers, which led many of her colleagues to the conclusion that she had tied the knot on the utterly romantic Cinco de Mayo holiday. When confronted about the addition of a second ring, presumably a wedding band, she stopped wearing it altogether.
Unfortunately, Brit Brit made the mistake of telling at least one of her colleagues the real reason why she stopped wearing it: She wanted to wait for the next company newsletter to officially break the news of her nuptials.
Now on the surface, most would consider this decision a little on the unusual side. Upon further investigation, anyone — with the exception of maybe Jim Cramer — would see she was in need of a good therapist.
After conducting the required legal research, I gathered some interesting and compelling facts to help me substantiate the claim that she was indeed crazy.
One piece of information being that in the decade-long history of the company, there had only been one newsletter and it didn’t even have an official name. Just how long would she be willing to wait to unveil the details of her holy matrimony?
Luckily for Brit Brit, the never-ending rumors circulating about her mental instability didn’t seem to damage her career professionally. But socially, she was very much an office outcast. At times it got so bad that human resources had to step in and hold a meeting threatening the other secretaries to “be nice” to Brit Brit or risk losing their jobs.
Unfortunately, office gossip is about as inevitable as the next celebrity meltdown and doesn’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon. Work can be difficult, boring and frustrating at times, so if inane news about a co-worker is what keeps you going through your day in a way a cup of joe cannot, then hey, do what you’ve got to do.
Maybe the real moral of the story is we all need to be a little bit better about disguising our inner Brit Brit. If you don’t give the gossipers something to work with, chances are, you will be spared.
In the case of loony versus lawyerly, it is the judgment of this column that you shall be sentenced to a life term of office scrutiny should you behave more National Enquirer than National Geographic.

We live in a time when Walt Disney’s name is linked to everything from theme parks to mouse ears. But people often forget that the name belonged to a true artist and a man who worked hard — and imagined even harder — to lay the building blocks of what has now become a magnificent empire.
What we see today are Disney’s greatest successes: Disneyland, his countless classic animated films and the joy his legacy continues to bring to so many people. What we don’t often see are the struggles that Disney had to endure and the hardships he had to overcome in order to make his dreams a reality.
El jefe · Disney’s latest documentary, Walt & El Grupo, captures a slice of the brilliant animator’s life unknown to most Disneyland-goers. - Photos courtesy of Walt Disney Studios
Walt & El Grupo, which screened on-campus Wednesday, is a documentary masterfully put together by writer-director Theodore Thomas and his producing partner, Kuniko Okubo. The film gives us a glimpse into one of the toughest periods in Disney’s life — a time when there was not only a world war going on, but also a war within his newly established movie studio.
In 1941, Disney was asked by the US government to take a trip to South America as part of a goodwill tour to win over the Latin countries as allies. The government wanted Disney to simply go and represent the positive aspects of American culture, but as Disney himself says in a sound clip included in the film, he’d “feel better about going down to do something rather than to just shake hands.”
Disney, along with wife Lillian and 16 chosen artists, animators and other employees (including Thomas’ father, Frank), set off on a 10-week trip through Brazil, Argentina and Chile. They went not only to promote goodwill among the Latin Americans, but also to conduct research for future films.
Meanwhile, Disney’s fledgling studio, which had just produced Pinocchio and Fantasia after having monumental success with Snow White, was struggling because finances were constantly being cut due to the war in Europe and a bitter animators’ strike in full swing. But the young, energetic Disney — who was not yet 40 at the time — embarked on his South American adventure nonetheless, hoping that all would be resolved by the time he returned.
And what an adventure it was. Photos, never-before-seen footage, drawings and animation displayed throughout Walt & El Grupo show us Disney learning the samba, dressing up like a gaucho and making friends wherever he went. The story of Disney’s trip bursts with color throughout the film, despite the fact that much of the material used to tell it is in black and white.
Though none of the travelers are still living, filmmakers Thomas and Okubo worked around this difficult challenge by artfully using sons, daughters, spouses and others close to those who accompanied Disney on the trip to relay stories, memories and even actual handwritten letters from their loved ones’ experiences in South America.
While these secondhand accounts provide a basic narration of the trip, the true essence of Disney’s travels south of the border is captured in the on-location shots of all three Latin American countries he visited, both of the scenery and of the people. The constant comparison of the places then and now through paintings done by Disney’s artists, photographs and videos shows us how much change the countries have undergone since Disney’s stay more than 60 years ago.
Walt & El Grupo makes it apparent that one thing has not changed, however, and that is how excited people in Brazil, Argentina and Chile become simply upon hearing Disney’s name. We hear commentary from a number of people from each of these countries,  and it is easy to see that they still admire him with the same vivacity as when they were young.
One person from Argentina recalled that although he and Disney could not understand eac other because of the language barrier, he could sense that Disney was very happy. Who could think otherwise when the man walks into a room on his hands, greeting those around him with a jolly “Hola, chicos?”
While Walt & El Grupo portrays an episode in Disney’s life that gives us a closer, more personal look at the man behind the magic, the film is about so much more than Disney’s journey to South America.
“It’s about artists and how artists make art and the role they play in society, whether it’s wartime or peacetime,” Thomas said in a Q&A session following an on-campus screening.
To tell a story about one of the most prolific, creative storytellers of all time is not an easy task, but Thomas and Okubo do it in such an artistic, multifaceted manner that even Disney, the great storyteller himself, would undoubtedly be proud to be a part of it.

When did some people start losing their marbles?
Maybe it was when the so-called “Birther Movement” challenged President Barack Obama’s citizenship, in the face of a legitimate certification of live birth issued by the state of Hawaii, along with other concrete examples of his legality.
Or maybe it was even further back, when people accused Obama (then a presidential hopeful) of being a terrorist, brought here to destroy the United States (his middle name “Hussein,” of course, being a primary piece of evidence).
Ultimately, Obama is one of the most polarizing figures in modern time.
So it should come as no surprise that many conservatives were in another uproar last week.
The saddest part, however, is what this controversy actually surrounded: a plan to give a pep talk to our country’s schoolchildren.
In all respects, this seemed like a perfectly innocuous thing to do; after all, kids are the future, and they could use some advice on staying in school and keeping off the hypodermic needle. And who better to give them this advice than the leader of our country?
To many, the gesture seemed sweet: a display of common values of hard work and wellness that hopefully would translate to the younger generation — something we can all agree on, right?
Wrong.
Apparently, there are parents in the United States who believed that Obama would use the time to press the importance of his politics. The assumption, of course, was that he would use impressionable minds to change the politics of an entire generation; this would make sense, maybe, if the president did not have a drop of common sense.
Did anyone really believe that Obama would have both the insanity and the cojones to, in front of an entire sensible nation, extol the greatness of a socialist agenda? Florida GOP Chairman Jim Greer thought so, as he was quoted as being “appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama’s socialist ideology.”
It seemed highly unlikely that Obama would stand before a nation and commit career suicide by throwing propaganda at kids.
Admittedly, some of the disagreement came from the fact that the US Department of Education proposed a plan to have students, post-speech, draft letters on “how to help the president.” But to be fair, the Department of Education conceded that the original plan was not well-worded and released a revised plan clarifying that the kids should list how to achieve their short- and long-term education goals. So why are people still upset?
The biggest issue here is the pointed division of political views in America today. To those who fundamentally oppose him, everything Obama does is an act of the enemy to be shot down at earliest notice.
There are some things that we as a nation might not agree on (such as the issue of a public health care system and its alternatives), but shouldn’t we all be somewhat eye-to-eye on at least the basics (such as the fact that our health care system could be much better)? How bitter does the bipartisanship have to be that some conservatives genuinely believe Obama is out to brainwash kids?
The statistics highlight this issue: As of Aug. 31, Obama had a 75 percent approval rating among Democrats, but only an 8 percent approval rating among Republicans.
Those who oppose Obama need to stop making assumptions and fighting non-issues. Not agreeing with the president is one thing — after all, we need debate on the important topics to help show the best path towards a healthy, powerful nation.
But needlessly picking fights and overanalyzing small issues is a setback for the whole country. It’s clear that there is a profound lack of maturity in American politics today. It’s often difficult to figure out who the real children are.

This is the way careers end — with a bang and a whimper.
The past week saw the public images of two seemingly irreproachable politicians take hits: Yorba Linda Assemblyman Michael Duvall, whose lewd comments were inadvertently broadcast during a Sacramento meeting, and Rep. Joe Wilson, whose shout of “You lie!” during President Obama’s address on health care has swept across Youtube with proliferations envied by piano-playing cats and talking geckos everywhere.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
The former resigned on Thursday amid a storm of cheerfully vindictive backlash, and the latter is currently sitting in the eye of a firestorm of criticism; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for a formal apology on the floor, and many others feel that Wilson should be chastised.
The representative, however, possesses a certain decorum-be-damned audacity that Duvall thankfully never assumed; the New York Times reported that he is now asking for campaign contributions in his new position as the vocal opponent to the Democratic health care plan. Wilson has raised more than $700,000 since Obama’s speech, and has spent the time developing a self-aggrandizing image for himself: the martyr who dares to stand up for free speech.
“They want to silence anyone who speaks out against this,” he said with Joan-of-Arc piety in a video posted on his campaign website.
Wilson’s incendiary outburst followed Obama’s assurance that illegal immigrants would not be covered under his new health care plan — an incidentally true statement. The representative’s itchy trigger finger, however, is indicative of a roadblock mentality that threatens to stall much more legislation in the coming year.
The topic of illegal immigration is one that is guaranteed to get people riled up. Wilson has surely gained many supporters for simply falling on one side of the issue’s fence (so to speak) despite the tactless and untimely way in which he voiced his opinions.
Ultimately, however, not only was Wilson’s animosity unfounded, it was unnecessary. The health care issue must be resolved, and piggybacking on catty cause célèbres instead of working toward a solution will only set the nation’s health care back even further.
The fact remains that it is ultimately possible for illegal immigrants to purchase insurance from unsubsidized providers — something that makes Wilson and his cohorts wary of Obama’s plan. But there’s nothing that can be done to change that, and we’d be foolish to waste time and resources policing a crack in the dam. Politicians’ efforts would be better spent coming to a resolution on the health care plan as it is.
This is not the time for a debate about illegal immigration; there will be a time in the near future, and we can only hope that Wilson has come up with some fresher rhetoric by then. But now is the time for as strong a show of nonpartisanship as politicians can muster.
Whether or not Wilson decides to apologize, we can only hope that other politicians realize the futility of argument. In the din of the health care debate, it’s hard to separate reason from emotion. Comments like Wilson’s are merely sound and fury, signifying nothing.

Katherine Goar, USC Fisher Museum’s education and programs coordinator, has always had a keen eye for beautiful artwork and a great enthusiasm for yoga. It is no surprise, then, that she has long thought the wide and soothing space of the Fisher Museum would be a great place to lay out a yoga mat.
Now, her vision has come to fruition.
Beginning this week, the Fisher Museum will host a free yoga class every Monday. The class will be taught in the museum, surrounded by the fall 2009 exhibit, Victor Raphael: Travels and Wanderings, 1979-2009.
“I’ve always been really inspired by the space of the museum,” Goar said. “It’s very tranquil…I do yoga myself and always thought it would be very nice to do yoga in here. Once I learned about this artist, I started planning a class … I’ve always somehow wanted to marry the two, and it just seemed like a perfect wedding here.”
The exhibit that will run in conjunction with the classes is a collection of more than 150 multimedia works detailing Raphael’s travels during the past 30 years.
Catherine Baker, a yoga instructor from USC’s Department of Physical Education who will lead the classes at Fisher, said she was excited by the idea of doing yoga alongside Raphael’s work. She believes Raphael’s work relates well to a principle metaphor that yoga enthusiasts follow: “Water is like the reflectivity of the mind.”
“This way of being able to present [yoga] in a new environment is just creative,” Baker said. “Yoga is holistic so there’s not much it doesn’t relate to.”
Goar said she hopes the program not only gives visitors a chance to do yoga in a serene environment, but also brings more people to the Fisher Museum.
“When you can get people to participate in something while they are in the museum, you’ve got them in there looking at the art and they are doing something participatory,” Goar said.
Some student yoga enthusiasts were intrigued by the idea of practicing in a museum.
Kyle Mombell, a junior majoring in biological sciences who has done yoga in the past, said peaceful and natural settings make a difference when practicing yoga.
“I think it would be cool just because of the nature of yoga and how it’s very sensual,” Mombell said. “For me, when I do yoga, the environment is very important.”
Mombell said he might consider attending the class, as long as the exhibit was not too distracting.
“I feel that [it] might be a little tranquil, interesting,” Mombell said. “But it’s kind of hard to say without seeing the actual exhibit.”
Arif Khan, a graduate student studying engineering management, had similar concerns. He said the exhibit’s multimedia features could detract from the thought processes and focus required during yoga.
“The idea behind yoga is to obtain mental peace through stretching your muscles,” Khan said. “If [the exhibit] is running at the same time it could be distracting because you’re trying to focus on your breathing pattern, muscles and that takes a bit of focus.”
Classes are open to the public and will be held every Monday at 3 p.m. Baker will lead the classes with help from yoga teachers from the USC Recreational Sports program and meditation teachers from the USC Office of Religious Life.
Goar noted she wants to keep this program going with every future exhibit at Fisher.
“My long term vision for this would be yoga under the stars where we have yoga at the museum and then go out in the courtyard and have a night event,” Goar said.

Thousands of people — including a handful of USC students — gathered Saturday in front of the Federal Building in Westwood, brandishing signs reading “Obamacare is a Nightmare” and “Nobama!”
An estimated 5,000 Angelenos attended the two-hour “Tea Party,” co-organized by local groups such as the Los Angeles Patriots, to rally for limited government and protest proposed health care reform.
Groups nationwide have organized similar “tea parties,” named after the original Boston Tea Party, because they feel the government has overstepped its boundaries through increased taxes and regulation.
The “Tea Party” was similar to an event held in Washington, D.C. on the same day, during which protesters marched from the White House to Capitol Hill to voice their opposition to the increase in government oversight, the New York Times reported.
Attendees at both the Washington protest and the Westwood protest voiced concerns about the recent legislation for health care reform in Washington.
Micah Zehnder, a senior majoring in philosophy, said he attended the rally with his father to see what  was like. He said he felt the event could have been more constructive, because no protesters offered solutions to their complaints.

Dan Schnur, director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said, “Obama’s conservative critics have decided that a ‘tea party’ is much more likely to catch the attention of the voters. [The name] evokes American history — it might interest someone who is not an ardent follower of politics.”
After bouts of chanting and rallying, the Westwood protestors were treated to a number of speeches espousing the conservative cause, including one from Thomas Del Beccaro, vice chairman of the California Republican Party.
Although the majority of protesters were older, a few USC students attended the rally to voice their concerns about health care reform, the Federal Reserve and taxation.
Schnur said the tea party, which ended at the same time Saturday’s football game began, probably wasn’t scheduled with USC students in mind.
“In the long run, the way the government spends its money is probably going to have more effect on our lives than how Ohio Sate defends Matt Barkley,” Schnur said. “But I wouldn’t want to make that case on campus on Saturday afternoon.”
USC College Republicans President Alexa Ekman said many college students don’t understand the role of government spending in their everyday lives.
“Some students think that, ‘Oh, they passed this stimulus legislation, but it doesn’t affect me,’” Ekman, a junior majoring in political science, said. “Students may not feel that an increase in taxes affects them now, but four years down the road, you will feel the effects.”
Even so, Ekman expects more students to get involved because of the present political climate.
“These students are going to be able to say, ‘I experienced this, I lived through this.’ Students are noticing this is a great time to be politically active. This is a time that’s going to go down in history, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican,” she said.
Arthur Pertzel, an undeclared freshman who did not attend the tea party, said he and other students did not go because younger people view taxes differently.
“Students don’t have to pay the same taxes as professionals,” Pertzel said. “And so a tax increase won’t grab our attention.”
Donna Bright, a member of the Pasadena Patriots said although not many college students attended the tea party, the youth movement is still important to the political process.
“They are great, they have energy, they are passionate and they are our future,” Bright said.

“Are we ready for equality?” Christine Pelosi, daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asked same-sex marriage activists gathered at USC during her keynote address.
About 160 students and community members gathered at USC this weekend for “Campaign Boot Camp.” The program, titled “Education and Empowerment for the Grassroots” included seminars and workshops, that sought to educate attendees about civil rights activism and political campaigning.

The Campaign Boot Camp ­— inspired by Pelosi’s book of the same name — focused specifically on preparing to continue the fight against Prop 8, the ballot proposal banning same-sex marriages in California. The proposition was passed in November 2008, overturning legalization of same-sex marriages by the California Supreme Court six months earlier.
“I believe in equality for everybody. The more that we can inspire people to be involved in public service, to be involved in something better than themselves, the more that we can get,” Pelosi said in an interview.
The event was organized by the coalition Organizations United Together West — a coalition of about 40 different equal rights organizations. OUT West composed an interactive training program with the support of other national organizations, notably Equality California and the Courage Campaign.
“I think this has the chance to impact the very near future, with candidate races and also with the upcoming marriage equality battle that will take place in the next couple of years,” said Chris Hauck, an OUT West event coordinator. “People actually have real-world lessons that they can apply, not just theory.”
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who sent a letter to the participants praising their desire to take action, promised to assist the activists in their fight to overturn the marriage equality ban.
“I don’t believe that we should discriminate against any of God’s children,” Villaraigosa said in an interview. “We should promote the institutions which have always been about families. That’s why I’m so supportive of this issue.”
As part of the boot camp, USC hosted speakers, election simulations and educational series on campaign operations, due in large part to the effort of the school’s LGBT Resource Center.
“It will get people prepared and ready for the next marriage equality battle, but then again, it’s not just about marriage equality. It’s about how these tools and techniques can be used for any sort of campaign,” said Vincent Vigil, director of USC’s LGBT Resource Center.
The focus of the boot camp was on dealing with challenges and frustrations of running any sort of political campaign.
“It’s incredibly hard to be patient when you’re trying to change the world and when you think the world is denying you the very basic human right, but learning to be operational and strategic in our thinking without sacrificing or compromising any of our principles — that’s the ultimate test,” Pelosi said to the participants.
A number of the attendees took part in a quick-paced campaign simulation on Saturday, forcing them to think through and implement campaign strategies in one hour that would typically take place in the nine months before any election day.
People with limited campaign experience worked in teams to learn how to manage a political campaign for the first time. The simulation was based on a state the size of Maine with the demographics of California to make it relevant to advocates of marriage equality in California.
“They’ve given us a look into how a nine-month campaigning process works and the realities of it, the limited knowledge that you’re given at the beginning and how you have to work with that and how you have to work with other people,” said Gregory Oertel, a freshman majoring in music performance.
Only one out of 17 teams that undertook the challenging campaign- simulation game won their ballot measure, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of passing a controversial issue like marriage equality. Fleischer said that it was common for all teams to be defeated in the simulation, reflecting real campaign efforts on gay marriage.
“Many people don’t know how hard it is to win these campaigns,” said Kathleen Campisano, who co-authored the simulation game and is a senior field organizer with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. “It helps them understand the frustration; it gets them to really understand that we’ve got to be really smart campaigners to make sure that we can win these elections.”
Participants and speakers at the Campaign Boot Camp also weighed in on the debate over when the gay marriage ban will be contested.
While the organization Love Honor Cherish is positioning itself for a 2010 ballot initiative for marriage equality, Equality California and others are setting their sights on the 2012 election.
Keith Peyton, a senior majoring in international relations and the lavender commencement project manager at the LGBT Resource Center on campus, said that marriage equality will likely be seen on the 2010 ballot.
“It’s definitely practical,” said Peyton. “Six states have already legalized gay marriage, California just went backward.”
In addition to the workshops, several notable activists spoke at the weekend event, including the Reverend Eric P. Lee, the president and CEO of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles.
“It starts with you to change the societal attitudes about LGBT justice,” Lee told the audience of activists. “Be passionate about justice universally because the fight for justice is not self-serving, but selfless. Look to serve the needs of humanity before our own needs, then our needs will take care of themselves.”
Lee paralleled the denial of fundamental human rights to the LGBT community to the African American civil rights battle and added that proponents of marriage equality must have a personal and unwavering conviction that they deserve equal justice, liberty and legal rights.
“The only thing that sustains us is knowing that it’s right,” Lee said. “Someday you will achieve it.”
