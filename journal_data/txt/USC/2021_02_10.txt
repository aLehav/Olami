One of the best artistic decisions director Catherine Hardwicke made for “Twilight,” and yes, it’s hard to narrow it down to just one, was using Radiohead’s “15 Step” to score part of the ending credits. 
The five-time Mercury Prize-nominated, 2019 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-inducted, six-time Grammy Award-winning English experimental rock band needs no introduction. Their musical influence has pushed the industry into the computer age, revived art-pop and has even inspired an emotion — the “Radiohead effect” was coined to describe the exact moment when one of the band’s songs captures your attention and leaves you at the mercy of its lyricism and sonic fantasies. 
I experienced the Radiohead effect recently. I watched Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Phantom Thread” with my Daily Trojan boss and, long after the credits had rolled and we said our goodnights, I laid on my back and stared at the ceiling while listening to “House of Woodcock,” the main jazz-improvisational/British posh theme of the movie. I felt like Beth Harmon as I almost could see and touch the kaleidoscope of note colors and textures that fills your ears and heart with every new crescendo and whine of the violin. 
And who is responsible for this? Jonny Greenwood, lead guitarist and keyboardist of Radiohead. The project, earning an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score in 2018, can truly be described as an arrangement, where Greenwood melded harmonies to its narrative and character compatriots and Anderson saw fit to edit as the music dictated.
Beyond what the music may symbolize to each viewer, Greenwood’s inclusion in the film conjures both the idyllic and the bittersweet. In what would be Daniel Day-Lewis’ final acting role, Greenwood said to the New York Times that the two collaborated to find a score that answers the following: “How can music sound English and still be Romantic?”
Although not known for its overt romance, Radiohead’s heart and love are held by the musicians. The group has not released anything since 2016’s “A Moon Shaped Pool,” and while the fixtures of the band go their separate ways, the movement can’t be described as a puzzle losing its pieces when each individual production is so impressive. 
Greenwood’s particular talent within the music scoring field has garnered the attention of audiences, filmmakers and composers around the globe for his other contributions. He scored the late Lynne Ramsay’s psychological terror “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” incorporating sounds such as a harp with metal screens to fill the screen with the echo of tension that permeates throughout the film. 
I have to admit that I’m jealous of Paul Thomas Anderson. As a fan of Greenwood’s, Anderson has incorporated his scores into several of his movies, including maybe one of the most significant departures from Radiohead-esque sound in “There Will Be Blood.”
We actually reviewed the film last week in my “American Film” class, and though everyone wanted to talk about the score, I find it interesting that the same pattern emerges in that no one talks about its composer (unless it is John Williams). When you listen to a score by Greenwood, especially in “There Will Be Blood,” you can’t help but make connections between the soft, patterning piano arrangements that remind of his home band, along with the influence of jazz and classical composers in Charles Mingus and Krzysztof Penderecki.
I’m not very keen at describing my relationship with music in film due to hearing impairment and other losses for words, but it is a disservice to our arts education if we don’t yield to the natural interdisciplinary aspects of film media and the influence of its individual visionaries. Whether you think Radiohead is washed, a meme or your favorite band of all time, there needs to be a rejoice of this sort of engagement of music influence — a project that can open the field from its elitist and predominantly white boundaries.

Christopher Manning will serve as USC’s first chief inclusion and diversity officer, President Carol Folt announced in a Universitywide email Monday. The all-new position was created following the events of last summer, including the national Black Lives Matter movement and the creation of the @black_at_usc Instagram page, and the role was defined through “extensive community feedback,” according to Folt’s email. Manning will assume the role March 1. 
Manning’s 90-day plan once he assumes the role involves facilitating conversations with students, faculty, staff and administrative leaders about their understanding of diversity at USC, and areas in which there is room for growth. In addition, he plans to conduct an audit of all the diversity, equity and inclusion work done to understand the University’s current state. 
“I’d like to combine the qualitative information from those dialogues with the quantitative information from that audit to then begin identifying high yield opportunities,” said Manning in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “My hope would be to start really launching some pilot programming in response to what we learned in that first survey of information as early as fall.” 
In the long run, Manning said he hopes to establish regular channels of communication with student affinity groups to “more effectively respond to student needs.” Following the national Black Lives Matter movement, Manning said that he doesn’t “want to pursue a model where the only time we communicate is during crisis.” 
Manning also consulted the @black_at_usc Instagram page, which provides a space for Black students, faculty, staff and alumni to share their experiences of anti-Blackness at the University,  for insight into the University’s need for diversity. He noticed that the page included stories not only about faculty and staff interactions but also students’ interactions with each other. 
“We need to think about a systematic way to equip students to be global citizens,” Manning said. “What I would like to do is encourage dialogue … and to figure out, ‘How can we create experiences that all of our communities have to go through that prepare them to be better participants in our miniature global community, that’s our campus, but more importantly, the larger global community that we all live in?’”
In addition to creating and implementing diversity-focused programming, Manning will lead the University’s Diversity and Inclusion Council. He will also assist in executing the President and Provost’s Taskforce on Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, and the Department of Public Safety Community Advisory Board. 
Previously, Manning served as the associate provost for academic diversity at Loyola University Chicago. There, he worked in diversity, equity and inclusion at an academic affairs level, creating a staff of diversity, equity and inclusion liaison trainers this year. He also served as an American Council on Education Fellow in 2019,  where he studied student success and metrics for diverse student populations. 
“I realized that diversity and success … are flip sides of the same coin,” Manning said. “You want to have diverse populations, and you also want to see evidence that they are fully actualized as human beings in whatever their role is in the institution.” 
Manning also founded nonprofit Inspiración Dance Chicago, a Latin dance company that teaches dance to young students at area schools, and hopes to utilize his experience in the arts to inform his work in diversity, equity and inclusion with artists at the University. 
“I am hoping that my understanding of what it feels like to have a life as an artist will enable me to communicate with artist populations, both within the University, but also connect to artist populations that are outside of the community, building partnerships and relationships that relate to our work in [diversity, equity and inclusion],” Manning said. 
As Manning begins the transition to take on his new role, he said he is “very excited to be a part of the USC family.” 
“I hope that, in time, USC will be a place where every one of our populations, students, staff, faculty, administration feels that USC is a place [where] they can be fully successful and actualized human beings, without regard to any aspect of their identity,” Manning said.

On any given weekend, the dulcet tones of Cary Grant’s voice and countless other Hollywood stars from days gone by would fill the Reed household. Curled up in her pajamas, Kennedy Reed grew up watching Turner Classic Movies with her mom. A tradition passed down by her grandmother, the two would spend hours captivated by the breathtaking performances of Hollywood’s finest. 
Reed discovered her interest in filmmaking as a child. But it wasn’t until college that her passion for classic cinema would take root through the creation of her digital platform, Gold Souls. 
Reed, a 2020 graduate who majored in cinematic arts, film and television production, started Gold Souls as an apparel shop on Red Bubble in 2017. Since then, Gold Souls has grown into a YouTube channel with a presence on Instagram and, most recently, TikTok. 
With the slogan, “Look back. Move forward.,” Reed uses Gold Souls to share both her love and criticism of vintage pop culture by presenting retro movies, fashion and music in a new way that is engaging for younger generations. Through Gold Souls, Reed hopes to create aesthetic content but with the long-term goal of educating and telling stories from bygone eras to today’s youth. 
“I feel like, as a Black woman, I bring a unique perspective,”  Reed said. “And my hope is [that] other Black girls will watch my channel and feel like, ‘Okay, cool. It’s okay for me to exist in this space and community. And if anyone tries to tell me that I can’t, if I know my history, then I have every right to be here.’” 
The Golden Age of Hollywood is an important cornerstone of Los Angeles history and as college students living in this city, Reed hopes that her peers will take the time to educate themselves on the injustices against, as well as the achievements of, Black artists at that time. 
“They had so much put against them. They were really struggling to be able to just exist, let alone create art,” Reed said. “The fact they push[ed] through and persevere[d], despite all of that, laid the groundwork for what I’m able to do. I stand on the shoulders of those people every single day.” 
Journey to classic cinema
Reed’s all-encompassing love for artistic expression allows her to wear many different hats: actress, singer-songwriter, content creator and digital artist, to name a few. A true Renaissance woman, art for Reed — in all its forms — is a way to escape, heal and reflect on the past. 
One of the strong motivators for the Gold Souls YouTube channel came from Reed’s two years at the TCM Classic Film Festival, spending her days with the TCM marketing team and running between theaters for screenings. For Reed, this is the best way to watch classic cinema as it’s the closest anyone will get to the original viewing experience one would have had in the 1940s or 1950s. After the festivals, Reed started making videos to share her experience and posted her first festival recap along with the Gold Souls trailer in April 2019. 
But the real launching point for the YouTube channel was an occupational therapy class Reed took at USC called “Creativity Workshop.” Under the guidance of Kim Eggleston, an assistant professor of occupational therapy, Reed got the push she needed to take Gold Souls to the next level. 
“It kind of changed my life as far as just creative confidence and really understanding the creative process and how to kind of care for your ‘inner artist,’” Reed said. “And I ended up making the Gold Souls channel trailer for my final project in that class. And that’s what really kicked it off.” 
For many in Reed’s cohort at SCA, the YouTube channel really seemed to pop up over night and the reception was overwhelmingly positive. 
“Everyone knew that Kennedy was the gal for Old Hollywood glamour,” TJ Ryan, a 2020 graduate who majored in cinematic arts, film and television production, said. “Kennedy has always been so genuine and authentic in her love for that medium, and sort of that world that you couldn’t really help but follow along and be … eager to delve down those roads with her.” 
Gold Souls
On the channel, the breadth of Reed’s knowledge of Golden Age Hollywood is truly astonishing. In her videos, Reed discusses everything from her collection of vintage Vogue magazines and the hot gossip between Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor, to her favorite Hollywood history books and classic films starring Black actors. 
“Her work is so impressively researched. She knows the backstories to every single person that she references, she understands the interconnected relationships between all these people and how that manifested in the work,” Madi Boll, a 2020 graduate who majored in cinematic arts, film and television production, said. “That is only something that people can gain from hours and hours of reading.” 
Reed acknowledges that finding ways to make the old more palatable to a modern audience can be tricky; particularly when it comes to generating interest in black and white films. 
For Reed, it’s the storyline that really matters the most. If people are willing to look past the outdated filmmaking techniques, she believes that they’ll be pleasantly surprised. 
“What I try to do at Gold Souls is to repackage some of those things in a fresh way that will hopefully get young people interested and influence them to want to check stuff out,” Reed said. 
On the Gold Souls Instagram page, Reed creates a unified aesthetic with warm colors and scrapbook-like composition where each of the posts compliments the other. Video clips, vintage photos and an occasional period portrait of Reed are surrounded by doodles and objects symbolizing the era. 
Reed is currently building up a similar aesthetic on her TikTok page. 
“The aesthetic qualities to it are so clearly and meticulously thought out,” Boll said. “She has done such a good job of finding the qualities in the medium and sort of the history that she loves, but also making it so visually attractive that there’s no way that anyone within our generation could discount the fact that what she’s doing is really pretty damn impressive.” 
Black Hollywood 
Because of these misconceptions and others, Reed believes that young people — especially young people of color — need to be introduced to classic cinema in the right way. Another reason younger generations tend to lack excitement for Old Hollywood is due to the lack of diverse representation. 
Whether in front of or behind the camera, Black creatives such as actresses Ethel Waters and Hattie McDaniel, dancers like the Nicholas Brothers and directors like Oscar Micheaux and groundbreaking films like “Cabin In the Sky” and “Paris Blues” made their mark on the film industry. 
“Cancel culture can be problematic,” Reed said. “If we pretend that Hollywood wasn’t racist by erasing racist films, I feel like then we’re discrediting what people like Harry Belafonte or Sidney Poitier or Lena Horne had to go through. So I feel we just have to contextualize them properly, not so much cancel them, but perhaps change the conversation around these films.” 
Reed also encourages people to go beyond the screen by reading up on Hollywood history. She recommends starting with author Donald Bogle, who is one of the leading authorities on Black Hollywood. Reed believes that his books and others can help the modern moviegoer learn more about Black creatives and how their experience differed from their white colleagues in the industry. 
“A lot of the people in the vintage community are totally open about criticizing the past eras and, and a lot of them use this phrase called ‘vintage style, not vintage values,’” Reed said. 
By using this phrase and the slogan of Gold Souls — “Look back. Move forward.” — Reed wants her generation to understand that people can appreciate the artistry of classic cinema and still be critical of the era. 
“People dress[ed] beautifully back then [and] I like the way people talk, I like the music, it’s just kind of a fun escape and it’s just an interesting way to learn about the past,” Reed said. “But more than that, I think as a woman of color, as a Black woman, knowing my history empowers me.” 
Still, Reed has found that some people don’t understand how she can have an interest in the culture from a time that was so oppressive to people of color. But Reed says that there are quite a few Black women in the vintage internet community, it’s just that they’re very underrepresented and can be difficult to find given that vintage YouTube content tends to be heavily marketed to white people. 
“People don’t expect a Black woman to be interested in some of the things I’m interested in. So I kind of like that, because it kind of shows people not to put people in a box,” Reed said. 
Ever the optimist, Reed hopes to use Gold Souls to bring attention to the vintage internet community and to continue the conversation on the contributions of Old Hollywood artists of color. 
“They left behind a legacy of strength, resilience and excellence that we should fight to preserve and use to educate ourselves,” Reed said.
Looking to the future
Reed hopes to continue growing Gold Souls. While the YouTube channel is still her main focus, Reed sees TikTok as an opportunity to catch people’s attention with her DIY content to then direct them to her longer YouTube videos. In the long term, Reed would like to see Gold Souls become a resource for creatives to learn from one another. Samantha Sadoff, a 2020 graduate who majored in cinematic arts, film and television production, shares that sentiment. 
“Her passion with this project is so immense, that it’s not something she would walk away from,” Sadoff said. “She has the ability to take this project and turn it into something bigger, like her own production company … possibly even consulting and advising with studios today about how to bring back some of that nostalgia and some of that romance of these old Hollywood films.” 
While the pandemic has disrupted the film industry and other creative fields, Reed’s friends and peers all believe that she’s the type of person who will excel at whatever she sets her mind to. 
“Everything Kennedy touches turns to gold,” Ryan said. “Whether that be in front of the camera, as an actress, or behind the camera, as a creator.”

Nearly 20 years ago, a fire drill went off at the USC New North dorms where the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life’s Director of Belonging, Cat Moore, lived as a freshman. She looked through her window and saw people gathering in their pajamas outside the building. Then, after touching the door to make sure it wasn’t a real fire, she hid in her closet out of fear of being among people.
“In that moment, I realized I would rather go down in flames than be in a situation with other human beings where I [would] feel so much social anxiety,” Moore said. 
Moore, who graduated from USC in 2005 with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, said she used to struggle with isolation and social anxiety and was terrified of rejection as an 18-year-old freshman. Moore’s life turned around 10 years later during her pregnancy, as her son helped her overcome her difficulty with connecting to people, she said. Since then, she has been helping individuals deal with similar challenges.
The Office of Religious and Spiritual Life houses Moore’s five-week workshop class “CLICK!,” which is taught through the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life’s Campfire initiative. This is a noncredit, free class available to all staff, faculty and students to join. Moore said the goal is to create a culture in which everyone feels that they belong.
“Being chronically lonely was a million times more painful than childbirth,” Moore said. “I know that those are different kinds of pain, but that kind of deep soul level pain where you feel like you do not have a place in the human family — which was what my experience was — it was severe.”
Three years ago, the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life brought in Moore while they were looking for ways to help USC students with mental health issues and to reduce suicidality, according to Senior Associate Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life Reverend Jim Burklo. Burklo, one of USC’s chaplains, invited Moore to become the director of Belonging. 
Burklo said several suicides in recent years prompted him to create Campfires — the ORL’s initiative to encourage closer relationships and friendship at USC. While Campfires includes programs such as “CLICK!” it also includes “Campfire” meetings to cultivate belonging. Burklo and Moore lead Campfires during holidays, but anyone can follow the guidelines online to learn how to lead one at any time. 
The guidelines, which include “stoking the Campfire” (posing the first question to the group) and “closing the Campfire” (creating a five-minute space for reflection), apply to both Zoom meetings and in-person park meetings, pre-pandemic, where campers would gather around a fire and get to know each other through various community-building exercises. 
“Some of these students that committed suicide had perfect Facebook lives,” Burklo said. “Their social media presentation was perfect, and everything’s hunky dory. So you just realized a lot of these relationships that people have are superficial, and a big problem on a campus full of very ambitious people is transactional relationships.” 
The natural reaction for mental health problems, Burklo said, is the direct approach of essential mental health services. Several biological and social factors have been linked to mental health, not just issues with belonging, according to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
Mental health is important as it includes emotional, psychological and social well-being; 50% of Americans are diagnosed with a mental health disorder at least once in their lives, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those suffering from mental health problems should seek professional help. Helplines and confidential services are available through the CDC’s website. 
“The nature of this mental health problem partly is cultural,” Burklo said. “So what you need is an orthogonal intervention, where you do things that don’t look like they’re addressing a problem at all. It doesn’t look like a mental health intervention at all, but it might have [the same] effect. That’s what we’re doing.”
Discussions at Belonging revolve around what questions to ask to create meaningful relationships and may involve talking about what feelings or challenges might prevent these connections, Moore said. These spaces are not therapy for mental health problems, but they are providing an alternative method to build community and support. 
Burklo said Moore’s class is not only a place for learning to connect with people, but it also trains student leaders and University staff on how to build community. In her class, Moore teaches leaders to structure their clubs so relationships can form among members. She emphasizes tools such as active listening and the importance of eye contact when someone is speaking during a gathering.
“[Moore’s] own journey informs her interest in this,” Burklo said. “It’s like ‘I suffered all those years, and I want other people to not suffer like I did. What can we do to make our society a place where there’s more friendship and connection and community?’” 
Moore’s work encompasses various approaches with a focus on listening to individuals and their concerns. Practices include teaching gratitude, forgiveness and empowerment for productivity.
Moore said she wants these practices to become student-led and is developing a future training focused specifically on student leaders, as well for professors who may be interested in supporting students’ social lives.
Besides teaching at USC, Moore hosts her own website where people can contact her as a speaker, counselor or coach. Moore also writes about “How to Create New Family When You Live Far from Home” and analyzes the role of relationships and integrity in systemic change within the Los Angeles Unified School District.
“[Moore] is authentic, she’s empathetic, she’s compassionate,” said Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, who is also the vice provost of campus wellness and crisis intervention. “I would like [students] to know that they’re seen, they’re heard, that they belong, that they matter, and that they are loved.”

The pandemic ushered in a sudden digital awakening for older adults, especially those who were forced to find new means of communicating with loved ones, or to even figure out how to get food on the table. However, while we can recognize that older adults are doing their best to learn more about technology, the lack of coherency on the state, local and federal levels paired with a lack of internet savviness has resulted in thousands of older adults simply clueless about how to sign up for vaccinations. 
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader asks. “Didn’t you give this whole rant about how older adults are able to use and learn more about technology? Why don’t these people just figure out how to use the computers and the Internet?”
Simply said, you’re absolutely right. Older adults certainly have the capacity to learn more about the current innovations in the tech sphere, and they should continue to learn more about the technologies or tools that you or I may use on a daily basis. That being said, this could certainly evolve into a whole conversation about crystallized and fluid intelligence and their respective impacts across the lifespan, but I’ll do you all a solid and save that for another time. 
I’d like to reiterate that while older adults are more than capable of learning about new apps or interfaces, the time-sensitive nature of the pandemic situation and noninclusive nature of big tech has made it difficult. I’d like to say that older people have made that leap to learn more about technology, but sticking the landing or even just making it all the way across in the first place is where people are falling off.
This leap also entails a flurry of scams and misinformation that have been derailing the vaccination effort as it pertains to older adults. Older adults are going to be targeted once again (as they have been particularly during the holiday seasons and, frankly, year-round), as scammers and fraudsters play into the panic and ambiguous nature of vaccine distribution. 
According to the AARP, some of these fraudulent schemes include providing ‘early access’ for a vaccination with a deposit or requiring someone to be vaccinated. People who may not know any better may easily play into these scams and end up empty-handed.
These disparities go beyond simply an individual’s ability to surf the internet. 
We should also take a hard look at transportation logistics and accessibility to said technology in the first place. While cities like New York City have introduced programs to accommodate older adults without readily-available transportation for vaccines, these initiatives must be pushed out at national level, since drivers at rideshare services such as Uber or Lyft may not have the time or patience to wait hours on end. Even after they are dropped off at vaccination sites, many older adults are unable to stand, let alone wait in line for the vaccine. Additionally, they may have access to a desktop or computer at home, but not knowing how to restart a modem or router if the WiFi goes down or having insufficient internet in the first place can make this already stressful vaccine registration process seem impossible.
Even worse, many of the older adults who are neither located in assisted living communities or nursing homes nor have family to depend upon must contend on their own. Many isolated individuals already struggle with degrading mental health and the impending thoughts of an ever-shortening lifespan. 
We’re looking at vaccination scams, faulty websites, conflicting government initiatives and the inability to find transportation. Let’s not forget the handful of individuals having to do all of this on their own.
If we’re going to push the conversation to encourage anti-vaxxers to vaccinate, we should also ensure that older people — especially those who actually need the vaccine — are provided ample resources to attain an appointment. It is imperative that we introduce new and innovative communication protocols to get everyone on the same page.

Israel has been leading the world in vaccinating its population. Fifty-nine doses have been given for every 100 people, whereas in the United States, just 10 doses have been given for every 100 people. Furthermore, 75% of Israelis over the age of 60 have gotten at least one shot. The small Middle Eastern country is far outpacing the U.S. in rolling out the vaccine, and this speaks to both the success of their existing public health infrastructure and the failure of ours.
Israel was able to secure vaccines quickly by selling themselves as the perfect pilot program for pharmaceutical companies to test their rollout strategies. Their public health infrastructure is what makes them the perfect pilot program.
The country has four nonprofit health maintenance organizations, and every Israeli is part of one of them. This ensures that all Israelis have at least some form of health care coverage. These HMOs do not just insure Israelis — they also operate clinics and provide doctors. The nationalistic quality of this health care system and the fact every Israeli essentially belongs to it has made it extremely popular. Seventy-five percent of the country has trust in their HMO-provided physician and 90% of Israelis are satisfied with their plan.
In addition to its popularity, Israel’s health care system is the fourth most efficient in the world. The streamlined infrastructure includes a single electronic medical record system, making it much easier to execute a vaccine distribution campaign. This is because government and public health officials can easily see the progress of vaccinations for different demographic groups, while individuals can login to their HMO account and see all the local vaccination centers and book an appointment.
The situation in the U.S. is vastly different. The two things Israel’s health care infrastructure excels in — trust and efficiency — are what the U.S. health care system lacks. 
According to a poll from the Pew Research Center in December, over 20% of Americans are completely unwilling to take the vaccine and an additional 19% said they will probably not take it. Meanwhile, only 9% of Israelis say they will not take the vaccine.
This lack of trust in public health systems in the U.S. has only served to slow down the vaccination process and lack of efficiency has accentuated it. Throughout Operation Warp Speed, which had the main objective of procuring vaccines for Americans, there was never a serious effort made to prepare and plan for vaccine distribution.
This resulted in widespread confusion over eligibility requirements, difficulty securing appointments to become inoculated and thousands of doses being thrown out a day. These problems are directly caused by the weakness of our public health infrastructure.
The U.S. lacks a centralized coronavirus vaccine website where people can see all the potential appointments in their area. This means people have to pour through dozens of websites a day in order to find an available vaccine. This also makes it more difficult for the government to track who has gotten vaccinated and at what rates different demographic groups are receiving the vaccine. 
As a result of this lack of efficiency and trust, only 8% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine so far, and there are signs that the distribution has been inequitable among different income and racial groups.
The slow pace of the U.S. coronavirus vaccine rollout speaks to the need to build upon the country’s existing public health infrastructure and the people’s trust in it. Health care policy is an ongoing debate in this country, and the coronavirus crisis points to the need for a more centralized, unified system in order to tackle issues of trust and inefficiency in public health.

Fresh off an energizing blowout win over UCLA, USC is top of the Pac-12 and set to face Washington at 7 p.m. on Thursday at Alaska Airlines Arena.
USC sits at 15-3 this season and is now ranked 20th in the country by AP after the team’s win over the Bruins. The Trojans hold the top spot in the Pac-12 with eight more regular season games to close out the campaign.
“The team is confident that we can keep winning, however, our league is very good this year,” said head coach Andy Enfield Tuesday. “We also understand that any team in our league can beat us, especially on the road. We obviously had a big win Saturday, but the two games that we play this week on the road present different challenges.”
For the Trojans, away games look and feel a lot different this year with the presence of coronavirus precautions. 
“There are no fans in the arena, which makes it an unusual experience,” Enfield said. “We’re completely isolated when we go on the road, so we have no interaction with anybody but our travel party.” 
Both of the Huskies’ conference wins this year, upset victories over Colorado and Utah, have come at home. Conversely, two of USC’s three losses this season have been on the road. Enfield expects his players to recognize the significance of the away game.
“They have had some big home wins this year,” Enfield said. “Our players will be ready. They understand the importance of this game, and we really respect [them] as a basketball team.”
In terms of personnel, Washington’s main scorer is senior guard Quade Green, who is averaging 15.4 points per game. The team’s marquee 3-point threat is junior guard Jamal Bey, who’s hitting around 54% of his attempts from beyond the arc this season. 
“They’re tough-shot makers,” Enfield said. “They can get hot and beat you from the 3-point line and also are quick enough to get by you and get in the lane.” 
Washington defends predominantly using a zone, something that Enfield noted in his game preparation. The Trojans dispatched the Huskies 95-68 in their previous meeting, and the head coach wants to see more of the same the second time around. 
“Last time we played them, we did a good job of sharing the basketball, hitting the open man and then making shots,” Enfield said. “We have to have a similar game plan where we make the extra pass and make strong and efficient moves to the basket.”
USC’s win over Washington this season saw five players reach double digits in scoring. Freshman forward Evan Mobley leads the squad with an average of 16.3 points per game. The surplus of options on the offensive end has been critical for the Trojans all year. 
“I’m really happy at our position and happy that all our players know that on any night anybody can score double digits and get hot,” said sophomore guard Ethan Anderson Saturday night. “We have a team that can keep this momentum rolling.”
The Trojans have grown into a cohesive unit this year despite an irregular offseason and just three returning players from last season’s team.
“We [have] so many new faces, and we didn’t have an offseason to work with our players or have them even get to know each other,” Enfield said. “The coaching staff [is] very impressed how this group of new players has bought into the team concept. We’re a much better team now than we were at the beginning of the season because we finally got to know each other and our players [are] very unselfish.”
As the regular season reaches its final third, USC has its sights set on the postseason and a Pac-12 championship. Enfield doesn’t want to look too far ahead just yet. 
“It’s a game-by-game season,” Enfield said. “We have to focus on each game, we can’t look ahead. Our league is outstanding this year with a lot of talented teams that can beat you on any given night.”

As a sports columnist, I would’ve never expected February to be a slow month for me.
Over the last few weeks, I’ve read countless articles discussing the Super Bowl. Even after the game, discussions over the results seem to drag on for the rest of the month. But in the esports world, nothing major is going on.
No significant tournaments, no new trends on Twitch, nothing. The most widely discussed news that was somewhat related to gaming was the recent GameStop stock surge. But it doesn’t take a financial expert to know that nothing about it had to do with actual games. In other words, it’s a slow month.
That is unless you take a look at Japan.
When talking about games, Japan is one of the countries that should instantly jump to mind. Not only are various famous gaming companies from there (such as Sony and Nintendo), but Japan often has a different approach to game development and video games in general than the one in the U.S. This was the case for Japanese role-playing games, an umbrella term for RPGs that don’t follow the western formula, such as the “Final Fantasy” and “Persona” series. 
And once again, Japan has an innovation not seen yet in the U.S. Of course, I am talking about “Super Nintendo World.”
For those of you who are not familiar with the project, “Super Nintendo World” is the newest addition to the Universal Studios park in Osaka, and will come soon to the U.S. The project was first announced in 2015. However, due to the pandemic, the opening was delayed, eventually settling on a Feb. 4 opening date. Sadly, Osaka had issued a state of emergency early-January   due to rising coronavirus cases, delaying the opening indefinitely. But since annual pass-holders had a chance to preview the area back in December and January, we already know what to expect. 
I would try to describe the area, but I genuinely recommend you look it up and see for yourself. The land looks straight out of “Super Mario Bros.,” and is filled with various “mini-games” outside of the attractions themselves. It is so true to source material that, even if you aren’t a theme park person, you will likely still have fun playing AR Mario Kart with your friends.
But how does this have anything to do with esports?
Well, while the land itself doesn’t explicitly fit the classic definition of esports, it is undeniable that its existence signifies major changes in the gaming industry. It shows that games are finally a mainstream form of entertainment, worthy of being put next to the likes of “Harry Potter” and “Jurassic Park.” But more importantly, it demonstrates that more traditional entertainment industries are willing to cooperate with gaming companies. And that has potentially huge consequences for the esports world. 
Let me give you an example: a gaming company cooperating with a record label.
This partnership would be beneficial for both sides, even on the simplest levels. It is no secret that music copyright strikes are a big issue in the streaming world. In actual tournaments, music is essential in order to build the “hype.” If a partnership is agreed upon, esports tournaments would be allowed to blast popular music, while the record label would gain control over a niche that is currently being underserved. 
If both sides engage in a successful partnership, it’s only natural they would want to expand. The next logical step would involve hosting a live concert by one of the bands on the label. This would allow the tournament to generate more loyalty and attention while the label would solidify its role in this particular tournament. All the while making more money as a result, of course. 
While there is no single blueprint to follow, it makes sense to me that a music and gaming festival would eventually be in the cards, alternating between high-level gaming events and shows from the most popular artists around the world. This combination could completely change the face of esports tournaments for years to come, and it’s just one possible scenario.
If both parties are invested in the partnership, the possibilities are endless, regardless of what type of entertainment company is involved. Ultimately, this would require a positive initial experience. After all, Nintendo partnering with Universal Studios is not the first time traditional entertainment has tried to bridge into video games. Or were you forgetting gems such as the 2016 “Assassin’s Creed” movie distributed by 20th Century Fox? 
But we shouldn’t allow some bad experiences to curb our enthusiasm. After all, bridging the gap between two different forms of media requires a lot of trial and error. But eventually, if both parties are dedicated and capable enough, some incredible projects can come into fruition, like “Super Nintendo World,” or even the 2020 “Sonic the Hedgehog” movie, which apparently did really well. And if that movie can succeed, then there truly is nothing to be scared of.

Correction: a previous version of this article misspelled head coach Marko Pintaric’s name. The Daily Trojan regrets this errorFrom his office at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, decked out in USC gear, water polo head coach Marko Pintaric opened up a Monday press briefing with a sigh.
“I think this is the first time I’m doing an opening statement after losing three in a row,” Pintaric said.
The No. 2 USC men’s water polo team went 0-3 this weekend at home in a round robin tournament against No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 Cal and No. 2 UCLA. 
Cal and UCLA are tied in the Collegiate Water Polo Association polls after each team won one and lost one against each other, leaving the UC Berkeley Spieker pool last weekend with records of 2-2 each. 
This past weekend restaged these tough matchups with the addition of a dominant Stanford team, who was competing for the first time in over a year, starting its season off in Los Angeles. 
Despite losing Olympian 2-meter Ben Hallock and quick drivers Bennett Williams and Dylan Woodhead to graduation, it seems that the Cardinal didn’t miss a beat with stand-outs sophomore 2-meter Beck Jurasius and freshmen drivers Ethan Parrish, Soren Jensen and Jackson Painter — all of which would be critical to Stanford’s scoring drives. 
USC and Stanford met for the first game of the tournament Saturday morning, with the Trojans hitting six to the back of the net to go into the second. After a period gone and eight minutes in, the Trojan offense came to an almost complete stop.
“We were able to score the goals early, our opportunities; the ball went our way. And that was the only time during the tournament that we had those momentums,” Pintaric said. “After that first quarter, again, offensively, our team completely died out.”
After matching the Trojans 6-6 at the half, the Cardinal added four to their lead in the third. Sophomore driver Marcus Longton, an offensive standout this weekend, tried to pull two out for USC after a dicey save from junior goalie Nic Porter, but the Stanford lead remained, finishing out the final period with a massive 14-8 upset over USC. 
Pintaric praised Longton’s contributions and sees great potential in expanding his offensive efforts. 
“If you leave him, he’s dangerous,” Pintaric said. “Stanford did leave him in that game, so Marcus was really more aggressive and finished his three shots … We need to do a better job to put Marcus in a better offensive situation.”
Saturday night’s game with Cal proved to be even more of a nailbiter. After taking a four-point lead into the half, senior driver Jacob Mercep, freshman 2-meter Max Miller and junior utility Alexander Lansill brought USC within inches of a lead, until the Bears answered back to carry a 9-4 lead into the fourth. The Trojans didn’t get the deficit any lower than 2 as the clock wound down and Longton’s last-minute strike was answered for a 11-8 finish for the Bears.
Though the Trojans took advantage of power plays and penalty shots for a .500 conversion percentage on each in the Cal game, each opponent in the tournament held on to a steady powerplay average of .400 against the Trojans, revealing holes in USC’s defense especially as the game veers into the second half. 
“Five on six defense is a communication,” Pintaric said. “We did some very, very good runs stopping the opponent for the long periods but again, I’m just going to revert to our third quarter. Our third quarter is very crucial in all these games. For our team, we’re really going to try to address why is our focus dropping down in that third quarter.”
The 6-on-5 defense and penalty opportunities would haunt the Trojans until their final matchup of the tournament against UCLA. Each team drew exclusions in the double digits, and USC made both its penalty shots by the work of Mercep, but only converted on one of 8 power plays. The Bruins and Trojans would go back and forth on drives, many times just one point away, until 2:25 to go and UCLA snuck one more in and held steady for a final 7-5 win. 
With part of the squad returning in their first games of the season this weekend after missing the last due to coronavirus protocols, the Trojans have yet to find a teamwide rhythm that, in the past, has made them almost unbeatable. 
Coach Pintaric sees that vision and continues to push toward it with the coaches, trainers and players. 
“Now this is really looking forward to getting everyone back, in any form,” Pintaric said. “Guys  were out for 10 days, some guys were out for 14 days, some guys played significant minutes — they’re obviously in different shape. But again, having them together and training in game situations, I think we’re going to have better practices and look much better and more positive.”
USC will stay at home this Valentine’s Day to host No. 5 Pepperdine for a matchup at 11 a.m.
