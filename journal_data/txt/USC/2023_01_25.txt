Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios president, producer and USC alum, will deliver the commencement address at the University’s 140th spring commencement ceremony, the University announced in a press release Wednesday. 
Feige, who graduated from the School of Cinematic Arts in 1995, leads Marvel Studios — home to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the highest grossing film franchise of all time at a cumulative $26.6 billion in box office revenue. Ten movies from the MCU have each grossed over $1 billion worldwide; “Avengers: Endgame” (2019) and “Avengers: Infinity War” (2018), in particular, earned $2 billion each at the box office. 
“He’s a creative force: an impresario who builds extraordinary teams and tells magical, diverse stories that captivate people around the world,” said President Carol Folt in the press release. “He sat in the same seats and walked the same paths as so many of our students — and look where his adventure has taken him. I can’t wait to hear his inspiring stories.” 
Feige, who currently sits on SCA’s Board of Councilors, established the Kevin Feige Endowed Fund for Creative Producing with the school in 2017 to support courses on taking projects from “idea to distribution.” 
In 2014, Feige received the Mary Pickford Alumni Award, an annual honor given to a former University student “whose extraordinary achievements bring special distinction to the USC School of Cinematic Arts and to the industry,” according to the Mary Pickford Foundation’s website. 
“Feige is an outstanding role model for all SCA students, as creative producing is a core competency across the breadth of the school’s curriculum, a hallmark of the industry’s best practitioners,” said SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley in Wednesday’s press release. 
In 2018, Feige received the Albert R. Broccoli Britannia Award for Worldwide Contribution toEntertainment from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. The following year, he was awarded the Producers Guild of America’s David O. Selznick Achievement Award. 
 “I’m honored and humbled to be asked to be the commencement speaker celebrating the 2023 graduating class,” Feige said in the release, “as they carry their own USC experience into the world to do big things as part of the next generation of storytellers and innovators and leaders.” 
The 140th commencement ceremony will be held May 12, 8:30 a.m. at Alumni Memorial Park.

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed a proposal to change the voting procedure to rank choice voting, an alternative voting system, for the upcoming presidential election during its Senate meeting Tuesday night. David Martinez, the parliamentary secretary, said the upcoming election will have five candidates — the most candidates USG has seen for this election in eleven years which creates a potential problem in voting outcomes.
Under the current system of plurality voting, Martinez said, there is a possibility for each candidate to get 20% of the votes. The result would be that 80% of student voters would not have a USG president they voted for, he said. 
“For the last 11 years, 71% of the time when we have more than two candidates, we do not reach a majority of the vote,” Martinez said. “This election with five candidates has the potential to have smaller than 50% of the vote share for the winner.”
The Senate will vote on the proposal to use ranked-choice voting during next week’s meeting.
Senator Sam Habibi presented projects he is working on, including the A+ Project and bringing back the Freshman Forgiveness Program, which allowed freshmen to have a pass/no pass option for their classes. 
Habibi also announced the RestSC project which he has been working on with senator Sanjana Sambhwani and Middle Eastern and North African Student Association advocacy liaison Eduard Ghazaryan. The project aims to create a commuter hub for students at USC so they can have a place to rest or take a nap before having to drive back to their homes. 
“The goal here is to implement at least a few sleeping pods on our campus even if we can’t find a centralized location for all of them,” Habibi said. 
Habibi also introduced an upcoming project, USG Remind, which will send text messages to those who sign up about USG events. The goal is to increase attendance for and promote USG events.
Christian Shaw was newly appointed as the new assistant director of the Philanthropy Fund. The Senate unanimously approved this appointment.
“I can’t think of a more qualified person for this job,” Habibi said.

The Alpha is back in Beacon Hills. Following the television series that aired from 2011 to 2017, “Teen Wolf: The Movie” (2023) brings creator and USC alum Jeff Davis’ world back to life, along with a terrifying new evil that has emerged among the pack. Fans have long awaited a reunion film after five years of anticipatory waiting. Despite the time away from Beacon Hills, Davis managed to tap into fans’ love for the show and devotion to the cast. Whether audiences are longtime fans of “Teen Wolf” or newcomers looking for a thrill, “Teen Wolf: The Movie” feeds all lovers of supernatural and drama. 
The film is set 15 years after the “Teen Wolf” season six finale. As the full moon rises, the wolves are howling again, calling for the return of every shape-shifter of the night to aid the cause. Staying true to its roots, the film retains classic elements of “Teen Wolf.” Scott McCall (Tyler Posey), while no longer a teenager, can still assemble allies and friends alike to fight against their deadliest enemy yet. Original pack members such as Lydia Martin (Holland Roden), Derek Hale (Tyler Hoechlin), Jackson Whittemore (Colton Haynes) and even Allison Argent (Crystal Reed) return to the screen in a fierce display of unique supernatural and natural power. New additions to the pack include Eli Hale (Vince Mattis) and Hikari Zhang (Amy Workman). Along with other familiar faces, the audience returns to Beacon Hills with an immediate flood of nostalgia.
The most notable aspect of this film is the cast. Despite the extensive time since their exit from the franchise, Davis still managed to reel back a majority of the show’s lead actors to resume the “Teen Wolf” story. This grand act created an almost seamless feeling between the two projects, greeting returning audience members with a sense of familiarity that they wouldn’t get in a spin-off.
While the cast contributed to the timelessness of Beacon Hills, the overlapping of originally separate storylines sometimes became convoluting in “Teen Wolf: The Movie.” Across the six seasons of the show, many actors exited or entered midway through. This led characters who had never interacted on screen before to suddenly be thrown together in the film without much introduction. The lack of time prevented the expansive development of such relationships.
Even though many in the cast have reached their 30s, the film highlighted the coming-of-age elements of “Teen Wolf.” Eli brought a youthful spirit to the film, demonstrating the emotional turmoil of being a teenager through the allegory of his budding werewolf abilities. 
As always, Coach Finstock (Orny Adams) provides comic relief with his competitive and unfiltered spirit during the anticipated lacrosse games. The balance between thrill, romance and light-hearted fun stays true to the vibe of “Teen Wolf,” only maturing its content slightly to gear toward the aged audience. 
A controversial, yet quintessential, move for Davis is the resurrection of Allison Argent. As soon as the film was announced, fans had mixed reactions toward her return. In an intertwined collection of plotlines, the film manages to reinvent the season she died: season three. Not every character from season three makes a return, however, as Stiles Stilinski (Dylan O’Brien) and Kira Yukimura (Arden Cho) do not appear in the film.
While the familiarity of both heroes and villains was also a draw for fan engagement, the film’s plot lacked some of the drive that propelled season three into becoming the most popular season of the show to date. The convoluted character storylines made it difficult to determine the end goal. What took 12 episodes to complete in the show was squashed into a roughly hour-and-a-half-long film, leaving some character arcs incomplete and others with an unsatisfying ending. While the story may have been better suited for a television format, the character reunions were still well worth the five-year wait. 
Just like the plotlines and characters, the visuals stuck true to the “Teen Wolf’’ show as well. The use of particular lenses fit the emotional intensity of scenes. The beginning of the film used more orange-toned lenses, highlighting open skies and bright details. As the conflict boiled, blue tones began shifting over the screen to enhance the tension and the brewing storm, both literally and physically. 
Unfortunately, some of the discernible CGI that was used in the latter-half of the film took away from the audience’s ability to digest the plot because of its artificial feel. Despite that, a majority of the shots felt very raw, such as in the woods or the lacrosse stadium, taking us right back into the heart of Beacon Hills. 
“Teen Wolf: The Movie” is set to release Jan. 26, exclusively on Paramount+. Expanding on the “Teen Wolf” universe, it is clear that Davis has a plan in mind for the future of Beacon Hills and its pack. So if you’re ready to watch the film, armor up, grab a sword or pop out your claws and be prepared for an action-packed adventure back into the heart of the supernatural.

Before Audrey Hepburn sipped coffee in front of Tiffany’s and Gregory Peck became a staple in grade school English classes through portraying Atticus Finch, the two Golden Age stars toured the streets of Rome in William Wyler’s classic romantic comedy “Roman Holiday.” Now, 70 years after its initial 1953 release, “Roman Holiday” has returned to the screen for a two-day theatrical run on Jan. 22 and 25.
When on a stop in Rome during her diplomatic tour of Europe, Princess Anne (Hepburn) craves freedom from her royal duties and decides to sneak away into the city. Before escaping, she throws a fit and is given a calming sedative, causing her to fall asleep on the side of the street. In a serendipitous meeting, American journalist Joe Bradley (Peck) stumbles upon her, unbeknown to her identity, and takes her to his apartment for shelter. 
When she wakes up the next day to find herself free from her constraints, Anne seizes the opportunity to live life outside palace gates; after realizing who he has taken in, Bradley seizes the opportunity to get an exclusive story about the princess. What follows is an escapade of Roman wanderlust as the two spend the day together, but life’s circumstances threaten to drive them apart.
Not often do films get to return to theaters after their original run, let alone for a nationwide release. With “Roman Holiday” especially, a film produced in classical-era Hollywood, viewers enjoyed the opportunity to view it as it was first intended.
“There were so many people [in the theater] who were older and who had the movie come into their lives when they were as young as I am now and who are coming and revisiting it as older adults,” said Quinn Soltesz, a junior majoring in business of cinematic arts. “It was really lovely to see it amongst that type of crowd.”
In 2023, viewing “Roman Holiday” in its original scale serves as a reminder of past audiences who once did the same.
“It’s like a time traveling device,” said Riley Ruiz, a senior majoring in public relations and marketing.  “I got to see what people saw the first time they experienced it.”
For the occasion of the film’s re-release, theater goers were also treated to commentary from veteran film critic and film historian Leonard Maltin. He is also a USC professor known for his instruction in the School of Cinematic Arts’ flagship course, Theatrical Film Symposium.
“I’m pleased to be asked to participate in anything that brings a good movie back into the spotlight,” Maltin said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
In his commentary, which was played after the film, Maltin shared behind-the-scenes facts about the production of “Roman Holiday” — discussing the impact of Wyler’s direction on the film, his groundbreaking choice to shoot on location in Rome and background stories about the actors and their performances in the film.
It is universally agreed upon that the film’s most significant performance is that of Hepburn, one that made her a star after being unknown to American audiences. 
“Audrey Hepburn’s charm is apparently ageless,” Maltin said. “She remains a style and cultural icon for girls and young women, even after all this time.” 
She also received the coveted Best Actress Award at the 1953 Academy Awards for her performance as Princess Ann.
“I really truly believe that Audrey Hepburn is a luminous, eternal presence on the screen,” Soltesz said. “She contains ferocious emotions underneath that are universally appealing.”
Ruiz finds Hepburn’s character of Princess Ann and her journey of personal growth to feel timeless and relatable.
“There’s an expectation that I think a lot of young people have when they’re still under their parents roof and they haven’t quite broken free and come into their own yet,” Ruiz said. “I think that the moment when [Ann] gets her hair cut … it’s one of the very first things that she does for herself. I think as a young woman that is so powerful, especially for me, whose mother literally cut their own bangs for them.”
Despite being released 70 years ago in black and white — a factor that tends to scare off modern audiences — the cinema of “Roman Holiday” has failed to diminish.
“The movie is quite funny and it’s quite physically comedic,” Soltesz said. “I think that it’s maybe overlooked for its physical comedy and only remembered for the romance, which I love both and I think they work in tandem perfectly.”
Ruiz also shared what elements of the film she found appealing. 
“It’s the cutest rom-com, with a twist. It has all the great makings of one, from the meet cute and the makeover scene,” Ruiz said. “Joe Bradley — what he was saying, ‘Life isn’t always what we want.’ To get to see someone live out that wish fulfillment with us in Rome, Italy of all places is such a fun version of escapism.”
With the chance to see “Roman Holiday” on the big screen surrounded by others, Maltin highlights the novelty of theater viewings — especially in a world where home entertainment is the standard experience for film watching.
“The best way to see any vintage movie is on a theater screen … such opportunities are becoming scarce,” Maltin said. “So I would jump at the chance to see this or any other classic film in a theater.”

A cacophony of ruptured noise transforms into a beautiful ballad, infiltrating the speakers and awakening a crowd lost in the midst of thundering music. As the booming beat of the drums provides a zealous rhythm for the bass and guitar, the vocalist hypnotizes the audience with their compelling lyrics, amplifying euphoric experiences throughout their set. These eccentric feelings, tied to everlasting memories are all shaped by the eminent rock scene.
Oftentimes, individuals might associate rock with popular bands such as Led Zeppelin or Metallica, all of whom are incredibly well known today. While these artists have come to make a name for themselves, the community falls short of representing people of color — notably Latine people — who have yet to make another breakthrough within the music industry. Although Latine rock had its peak in the ‘80s and ‘90s, this wave of interest could allow for resurfacing once again — with a new purpose.
Bands such as Archer Oh, Mexican Slum Rats and The High Curbs are all creating their own legacies among the scene, paving the way for people of color to change the narrative of how rock and surf punk is perceived. These bands are giving the opportunity to realize that their listeners’ favorite musicians are from similar backgrounds, knowing they are seen and recognized in this safe and inclusive environment. 
Archer Oh, for example, is taking the initiative of incorporating the exuberant sounds of a trumpet and harmonica to compliment their already complete ensemble. Their new album “Gradients” is a hauntingly stunning entity that explores the infinite possibilities of music, magnifying the stories of Hispanic origins. Specifically, the song “The Western Surf” is a must-listen, providing a semblance of mariachi music infused with lyrics that evoke an impassioned, indelible tone that will leave listeners wanting more.
The Mexican Slum Rats, who just recently released a new single “HIVEMIND,” are masters at composing songs one can feel to their core, balancing tranquility with chaos — a perfect mixture that is only heightened by their expressive instrumentals. Lead vocalist Kevin Villalba has an unforgettable and profound pitch that lingers to correctly portray the sense of vulnerability people often attempt to conceal, humanizing their music and creating an outlet for others to turn to. Accompanying Villalba’s vehement displays are the distinct sounds of a strumming guitar, making for a complete and ideal performance. 
Members of The High Curbs Eduardo Moreno, Alberto Alvarenga, Aaron Korbe and Kenny Huerta all expressed how going from small backyard shows to now preparing for their west coast tour was no simple feat. Without much experience in songwriting, they took the time and effort to teach themselves how to illustrate emotions in the form of melodies. Persisting through such obstacles, refusing to let anything hinder their journey toward producing memorable pieces, sets them apart from the masses. Their unyielding determination and willingness to make a name for themselves has brought them such well-deserved success. 
Their songs “Want,” “Always on My Mind” and their newest release, “I’d Run Away With You” have all become fan favorites with more than three million streams on Spotify. Echoes of intense and authentic emotions can be heard from each track they released, ranging from heartache to sonorous and piercing roars of rhapsody. The band allows for every unforgiving beat of the drum, reverb of a guitar and strum of the bass to be acknowledged, penetrating the barrier of exposed identity confronted with rock. Anyone listening to The High Curbs is reminded that they are not alone, regardless of whatever emotional or physical toll they might be going through. 
Having built a foundation of unwavering acceptance within their audience, more people are invited to take a peek inside this setting of camaraderie and respect. Understanding that the band had to navigate these realms without much guidance has come to reinforce the importance of appreciating their delicately crafted art. 
The difficulties of affording private music lessons and the privileges of being connected to the business stress how the music industry turns a blind eye to pure talent, served on a platter right before them. 
The call to attention for more representation augments a relentless battle that encourages artists from a multitude of cultures to keep pushing back against the injustices that mainstream society tolerates. These performers have all weaved together extraordinary harmonies with their music, and it is about time to spotlight such brilliance.

One of the most interesting and worrisome elections this past midterm season was the race for senate in Georgia. The bout was between incumbent senator Raphael Warnock and former University of Georgia star Herschel Walker, who repeatedly expressed his far-right and absurdist beliefs. Much of the worry for this election was that it had gone to a run-off and Walker was very close to claiming a seat at the Senate. Warnock beat Walker by a slim margin, 51% to 49%, to retain his seat.
Walker’s qualifications, as well as his policies, caused concern among many Georgia voters. With his allegations of domestic abuse latching onto his campaign, as well as political stances like being against abortion, it’s made him an easy person to dislike. Even those who sided with his political views started questioning his policies when there were allegations of Walker paying for abortions in the early 2000s, going against his anti-abortion stance. 
With no real background in politics, many feared that if he were to be elected into the Senate, it would be a detrimental loss for Democrats. Considering that Walker’s campaign managers had to limit the amount of public appearances he made to prevent him from spewing more controversy, it should’ve sparked a red flag for many that he isn’t the best candidate to vote for. But I suppose I can only speak for myself.
Another athlete who made talks about becoming a political figure is retired NFL and Cardinals star Larry Fitzgerald. While it was just speculation, there were talks of Fitzgerald possibly running for president, but Fitzgerald dismissed those claims saying he was uninterested. 
The likely future Hall of Famer wide receiver was friends with John McCain, who served as Arizona’s senator from 1987 till his passing in 2018. This relationship, it caused a lot of people to wonder if Fitzgerald would ever throw his name on the ballot and run for a position in government. Considering his stardom in Arizona, it wouldn’t have surprised many if he were to run for something in the Grand Canyon state.
Taking a look at other sports figures who aim to enter a political role in their respective nations, one that has stuck out to me ever since it was announced was that of Liberian President George Weah. If you don’t know much about Liberia or soccer, I’d assume this is the first time you’re hearing his name. The Liberian was one of the most successful strikers in the ‘90s, even winning the Ballon d’Or, the award for the best player in the world, in 1995.
With the success he achieved as an athlete, he became a household figure in Liberia. Soon after his retirement, Weah pursued a career in politics. In 2005, he ran for president, but fell short. He later ran for Senate in Montserrado County in 2014, winning the election that set up his eventual presidential campaign . He faced Joseph Boakai in the 2018 presidential election, winning the popular vote by a whopping 61.5 points. 
However his tenure as president hasn’t lived up to his promises for the Liberian people. Much of his time has been spent battling corruption scandals. One of the promises he made during his campaign was to fight against the corruption that had been plaguing the nation for years. With many of those issues still remaining under Weah’s reign, it’s clear to see that he hasn’t seen much success. 
It’s not to say he hasn’t tried to do something to help the economy of Liberia, as he cut his wages by and put salary caps on government officials. Weah has also made it a point to improve the roads, schools and buildings in Liberia, as well as providing scholarships to students seeking further education. With Liberia’s general election coming up this year, it’ll be interesting to see how Weah fares in his campaign to get re-elected. 
As shown in recent years, celebrities with no political background running for positions in government are getting more popular, not just in sports. It makes me uneasy to think about the large population of people who might value someone’s athletic achievements over their political capabilities. I’m just hoping that if a sports figure in the United States does end up winning a position in government in the near future, that everything goes swimmingly. But as of right now, I don’t know if I have much faith in that.

If you were anywhere in Los Angeles last week, you probably heard someone look at the sky and say “we needed this” as rain flooded the city. Like any good Californian, I took the rain as a sign to make soup. In my case, I made a pot of vegetarian chili — packed with beans, warm spices and fall vegetables.
As I let the steam from the chili fog up my glasses, I thought about how soup crosses cultural barriers. From ramen to matzo ball soup, every community has its own version of soup. For a food to have such a dominant global presence, there must be some magic to it.
My favorite soup has always been my mom’s kadhi, a delightfully tangy soup made with gram flour, yogurt and a plethora of spices. Whenever kadhi is on the table, we end our meal by filling our plate with everything on the table and drowning it in kadhi. As you stir the kadhi with rice, lentils and vegetables, it transforms these separate pieces of a meal into a complex mix of flavors and textures that bleed into one another.
The magic of soup is its ability to create something that is greater than the sum of its parts. This collection of spices, vegetables, lentils and meats turns into a heartwarming meal. Whether you grew up eating gumbo or borscht, you know the transformative power of good soup.
In the same way that soup brings ingredients together, it also brings people together. Considering the number of ingredients that go into most soups, the average soup recipe makes much more than one serving. Even a standard can of Campbell’s tomato soup serves at least two people.
Making soup is an invitation to create community in a time when human connection has become a scarce resource. In a 2020 survey, 36% of American adults reported feeling lonely “frequently,” “almost all the time or all the time” — with 43% of young adults reporting that the coronavirus pandemic had made them feel even more isolated.
Considering its detrimental health effects, loneliness is a developing 21st century epidemic. Chronic loneliness increases the likelihood of developing heart disease, stroke, a weakened immune system, depression, anxiety, long-term disability and a variety of other adverse health outcomes.
In a world full of apps designed to make us feel more connected, we somehow feel more alone than ever. Social media is sold as a way for us to stay in contact with those we love, but it often replaces more meaningful interactions. Rather than checking in on one another, we rely on Instagram stories and BeReal comments to keep our community alive.
 A recent study showed that approximately a third of people communicate with their loved ones less frequently since they follow them on social media. Though social media can be a powerful tool to help us maintain our relationships, the screen separation can make it harder to maintain vulnerable and honest communication.
Not only does it decrease the quantity and quality of our interactions, but it also feeds our insecurities. Social media is a space of constant comparison, where we see the best moments of the parties we weren’t invited to and the people we can never become.
These comparisons manage to make us feel alone in our loneliness. While we watch the people we follow have the best days of their lives, we feel as though our lives are uniquely miserable, as if no one else experiences those same moments of heartbreak or anxiety.
Social media often pulls us away, but soup brings us together. It’s a classic remedy not even Instagram can defeat.
Soup is a dish best made for a group; it encourages us to make space for the people that we love. It fosters those moments of laughter and nourishment at the dinner table when we feel most connected to and loved by the people around us.
Food ensures our bodies continue to function, but soup ensures that our need for connection is satisfied. Soup is the perfect opportunity to invite those around us, from lifelong connections to newly developed acquaintances, to find warmth in a bowl of phở and friendship.
There are few things that have the power to soothe our body and soul the way soup can. As we feel more and more disconnected from one another, the healing power of soup is stronger than ever. 
Even if it’s not a rainy day, when you feel social media pull you into a downward spiral, a pot of soup and a dinner invitation can melt away the insecurities and disconnection.

“Shit!” is the only thing that comes to my mind as panic takes hold of me. I woke up late again. I hit snooze too many times, wanting just another couple of minutes of sleep. I’m awake, and yet I still can’t get myself to leave my bed. 
Time is ticking, but I keep scrolling through my  For You page. Anything to distract me from the seemingly never-ending mountain of tasks that I need to complete today. It weighs on me, a heavy burden that slowly crushes my chest, turning the air in my lungs into mercury. It doesn’t help that, as I scroll, I keep stumbling upon videos of people waking up at 4 a.m. and having perfect, productive mornings. 
Seriously, why does self-care have to be so trendy? Everywhere I look, I find reminders of all the ways I am falling short in comparison to those around me. Does this ever happen to you? Do you ever feel like there are never enough minutes in a day? But here I am in bed still wasting the little time I have. 
This used to be how I felt every day. I used to wonder why I was feeling so burnt out. I thought it was because I was doing too much, but the issue was the exact opposite — I was doing too little. Well, at least for myself. I didn’t value myself enough to give myself anything or any time. I was only expending all my energy until it ran dry. Yet by simply setting aside a little time and creating better daily habits, I was able to feel my life get the revamp it needed. 
I now feel excited to get out of bed every morning, refreshed and ready to tackle my day. I can admit that I am a bit of a wellness junkie. For me, supplements, cute journals and wellness Pinterest boards are a big part of my own self-care. However, it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. Just like anything else, self-care is a journey of ups and downs. So amongst the sea of self-care videos, posts and products, it’s important to remember the most important factor in the equation: you. It all comes down to each of us making the time for ourselves. 
Personally, I have found it easiest to break down my daily self-care practices into three parts: grounding myself, challenging myself and protecting my peace. 
Grounding yourself is essentially being able to shut out distractions and bring your focus to what is right in front of you — the present moment. Personally, I have found meditation and journaling to be an effective and easy way to achieve this. In fact, meditation is one of the easiest ways you can start incorporating self-care into your routine. There are countless apps that can be downloaded to guide you through daily meditation. 
As someone with anxiety and a professional overthinker, I find that by meditating every day, I start my day with a clearer mind that lasts throughout the day. Studies show that meditation can play an important part in people living balanced lives. In addition, data shows that meditation can even reduce depression in some individuals. 
In terms of exercising, challenging myself through physical activity has transformed my life more than anything else. It has given me confidence and reassurance that has bled over into every part of my life. It has taught me that I am capable of enduring anything and everything, even when life seems difficult. I know that by doing so I am only getting stronger. It’s an incredibly powerful mindset that can be applied both in and outside of the gym. 
My final self-care practice is “protecting your peace.” It can perhaps be the most challenging, but also the most rewarding. This is because it requires more than just setting time aside for yourself. You have to be willing to sit with yourself and to be honest about what isn’t serving your best interest. This may require a lot of work and action, having to put up boundaries with people and making difficult choices. But it will save you time, energy and effort in the long run. 
I like to think of protecting my peace as gathering data about what makes me feel good. Through various life experiences and even making mistakes, I am able to take into account what choices will best serve my well-being long term.
So next time you see a video about self-care pop up on your For You page, it might be worth letting it inspire you to set aside some time to do something for yourself. While it might not be something you should live your life by, some trends are worth following. Trust me, you’ll be glad you did.

Student Health is introducing updated mental health services in the wake of two back-to-back mass shootings that have shocked residents of California. 
A new 24/7 chat service is now available via Student Health as part of their partnership with Oasis. They have also introduced extra sessions of the “Let’s Talk” program in partnership with Asian Pacific American Student Services, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday morning.
“It has been a really difficult couple of days beginning with the events in Monterey Park and now news of a second number of shootings here in California. I think many people are personally affected … as well as just the sense of loss of safety and loss of security, and the fear that people are feeling,” Van Orman said. “We really want to encourage people to reach out, if they’re feeling that, to talk to peers and friends or to reach out for resources.”
Van Orman said the new Oasis chat service is not a “clinical” service, “but it’s great for people if they’re feeling just overwhelmed or stressed.”
Students are also encouraged to ask for help via Student Health’s 24/7 mental crisis line.
Beginning Feb. 1, Student Health will organize influenza shot pop-up tents across campus. These will take place through the end of February on Tuesdays at USC Village, or Wednesdays during the Trojan Farmers Market at McCarthy Quad. Van Orman encourages students who have not already done so to get their flu shots, stressing that flu is still a risk.
“It’s very early in the flu season, and last year we had flu as late as April,” Van Orman said. 
Currently, only about 30% of undergraduates and 40% of graduate students have received their flu shot. 
“People with influenza actually tend to be pretty sick,” Van Orman said. “Flu shots don’t 100% protect you from getting the flu, but they definitely mean lower levels of symptoms and more mild disease.”
Student Health continues to keep tabs on coronavirus cases, which Van Orman says are down from 100 cases last week to 86 cases this week. In light of the Food and Drug Administration’s outline for an annual coronavirus booster plan, Student Health will focus on tracking national health updates and creating clearly outlined guidelines for the USC community.
“We think that there will be some need for ongoing boosters, at least for individuals at higher risk and older,” Van Orman said. “I think what [the FDA is] trying to do is really kind of start to lay out a plan that will allow people to move this into their normal sense of regular preventative measures.”
Currently, the University requires students, faculty and staff to receive their primary vaccination series as well as one booster. 
“We’re going to be looking at our policy over the next couple of months,” Van Orman said. “Unless something changes, I think it’s unlikely that we’re going to have a policy that requires people to get all their boosters, but we might recommend that.”
Van Orman said that Student Health is prioritizing good public health information and ensuring that the entire USC community has access to the vaccines they need.
“I think the real take-home [message] with the FDA issue is really that the medical and public health community [needs] to start providing clear pathways for people to understand who should be boosted and when should you be boosted,” Van Orman said. “Because it’s really very confusing right now.”

Jason King will serve as the new dean of the Thornton School of Music, Interim Provost Elizabeth Graddy announced in a communitywide email Tuesday.
A self-described “multihyphenate,” King is the chair of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, and the Institute’s founding full-time faculty member. He also served as the Institute’s inaugural director of global studies, and previously its artistic director from 2006 to 2012. The website for the NYU Tisch School of the Arts labels the Canadian-American a “scholar, journalist, author, musician, DJ, performer, producer, songwriter, radio and video host, and event curator.” 
“We are excited that [King] will be able to leverage his strong network and interdisciplinary experience of performance, teaching, production, research, and business acumen to benefit the Thornton School of Music community,” wrote Graddy in the announcement, sent on behalf of President Carol Folt.
In a series of tweets Tuesday, King announced he would be resigning from his positions at NYU at the end of Spring 2023.
“I’ll be leaving NYU with only the highest respect for all my faculty, staff, and colleagues,” King wrote, “and for all the truly exceptional and gifted students I’ve been privileged to meet and work with over the past two decades. It’s been a dream.”
King, an inaugural member of the Kennedy Center’s Hip Hop Culture Council, is also a regular contributor to Pitchfork, publishing articles and reviews centered on rhythm and blues and pop. In 2016, he hosted and co-produced the NPR Music docu-series “Noteworthy,” consisting of interviews and behind-the-scenes coverage of big names in the music industry, including Alicia Keys and Dua Lipa. Under his leadership at NYU Tisch, he has invited Keys, among a slew of other celebrated musicians — such as Pharrell Williams, De La Soul and Nile Rodgers — to the school.
“I’m excited to take the [reins] at Thornton, an exceptional institution with a profound history,” wrote King in a tweet Tuesday. “In my new role, I will help lead the school and extend its legacy of creative and educational excellence, building on the monumental work of the program’s previous leaders and from brilliant Interim Dean [Josh Kun].”
King will succeed Robert Cutietta, who served as Thornton dean for 20 years, as well as the founding dean of the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance since 2011, before resigning from both positions in June. Cutietta oversaw the hiring process for all faculty and staff at Kaufman, as well as a 40% increase in Thornton’s physical size with new and renovated facilities — including The Music Complex, Songwriter’s Theater, Schoenfeld Hall and a practice-room facility at University Gateway. In August 2021, then-Provost Charles Zukoski wrote in an announcement to the USC community that Cutietta would be stepping down and taking a two-year sabbatical before returning as a faculty member. Josh Kun, chair in cross-cultural communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, stepped in as interim dean while a search committee decided on Cutietta’s successor. Kun will continue his position as interim dean for the remainder of Spring 2023.
“I’d like to express our deep gratitude to Josh, whose bold vision and passionate advocacy throughout his time as Interim Dean has continued to propel Thornton’s critical role in the arts at USC and in Los Angeles, and set a strong foundation for its new dean,” Graddy wrote in Tuesday’s announcement, thanking the search committee and the Thornton community for their contributions to the hiring process. “Our school is a thriving group of scholars, artists, performers, educators and more, and we look forward to continuing to advance our pursuit of musical excellence.”

After emerging victorious from a tug-of-war against No. 14 UC Santa Barbara Thursday, No. 10 USC will look to continue its momentum against CSUN on Wednesday. Under Head Coach Jeffery Nygaard, the Trojans have a 5-2 overall record heading into the match against the Matadors. Two brothers, CSUN’s Kyle Hobus and USC’s Luke Hobus will clash.
“[We want to get] their setter uncomfortable,” said sophomore opposite hitter Luke Hobus in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They’ve got some big pins, ones like my brother, so I don’t want him hitting.”
Kyle Hobus led all players with 11 kills in the Matadores’ previous match against the Trojans and currently leads CSUN with 66 strikes on the season. The San Pedro native is 24th in the nation with 3.47 kills per set.
“He’s their go-to guy,” Nygaard said. “[He is a] big, physical [guy] that improved in a lot of ways from last year to this year.. . We’re going to throw a number of different things at him and see what works for us.”
USC defeated CSUN three sets to zero earlier in the month at the ASICS Invitational. However, the game was closer than the match score suggests, with the Trojans winning by 3 points or less in two of the three sets.
Graduate opposite hitter Kevin Kobrine and redshirt junior opposite hitter Simon Gallas led the Trojans with 9 kills each in that game. Kobrine is second on the team in kills with 77 in seven matches. 
Aside from Kobrine, USC’s offense is led by freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein, who is having a fantastic start to his collegiate career. After recording just 11 kills in the first two games of the season, Klein has notched 81 kills in the last five games. 
The freshman is 20th in the nation with an average of 3.54 kills per set. As a team, the Trojans are 14th in Division 1 with 12.04 kills per set. Klein credits his early success to junior setter Nate Tennant.
“Nate trusts me a lot,” Klein said. “He sets the ball really nicely [. . .] If you get a good pass, you get a good set. With a good set, it’s easy to get a good swing.”
Klein will have to face a CSUN team that is on a four-game winning streak after failing to win a single set against USC and No. 2 UCLA to start the season. Defensively, CSUN limits opponents to a .188 hitting percentage, the ninth-best mark in the nation. Klein recognizes that USC will have to handle the ball well to get past the Matadores’ defenses.
“We want to control the first contact whether it’s serving or it’s passing,” Klein said. “[We want to be] the best we can be and then let the rest of our game take over.”
So far this season, USC is 0-2 on the road, while CSUN is 3-0 at home. Despite this, Nygaard believes his team will do well at the Matadome.
“We’ve proven that we’re a good away game team,” Nygaard said. “We can take our brand of volleyball and perform at a good level everywhere we’ve been so far. We’ve been tested a lot, [only having] one home game.”
And by the way, Luke Hobus says there’s no bad blood between the Hobus brothers.
“[The UCSB game], we had lunch right before, but we weren’t talking about the game,” Kyle Hobus said. “We were just talking about life.”
The Trojans will hit the court at the Matadome on Wednesday at 7 p.m. when they take on CSUN.
