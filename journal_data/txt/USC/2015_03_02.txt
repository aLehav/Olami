Ray Irani, trustee, alumnus and Judge Widney Professor of Chemical Engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering and Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, has donated $20 million to fund the creation of the new Ray Irani Residential College at the USC Village, projected to open in spring 2017.
The $20 million donation contributes to USC’s multi-year fundraising campaign which seeks to raise $6 billion for academic and philanthropic advancements throughout USC and non-USC communities.
The Ray Irani Residential College is one of two residential colleges set for construction at the USC Village. USC trustee and fellow alumna Kathleen McCarthy will chair the McCarthy Honors College, the first residential college to be established for the USC Village. The Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Foundation donated funds last year to establish McCarthy Honors College.
According to USC News, $15 million of the donation will be allocated toward the creation of the Ray Irani Residential College and $5 million is set to introduce two faculty chair positions, as well as contributions toward a student support fund. The donation also funds the creation of the Ghada Irani Chair in the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
Irani’s donation is among the largest donations to the $650 million USC Village retail-residential project.
“I believe residential colleges are invaluable to helping students acclimate to and make the most of their university experience — especially students coming from other countries and cultures,” Irani said in a statement released by USC News.
Irani, a doctorate recipient from USC in 1957, worked for Monsanto as a research scientist and later moved to work for Diamond Shamrock Corporation and the Olin Corporation. Afterwards, Irani moved on to conduct research for Occidental Petroleum, where he later served as chief executive officer and chairman. Irani retired from Occidential Petroleum in 2013.
In addition, Irani has received honors from the French National Order of the Legion of Honor and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
“As a trustee, donor, alumnus and distinguished faculty member, Ray Irani has been a pivotal partner — and beloved member — of the USC community for more than six decades,” said President C. L. Max Nikias in a statement released by USC News. “Dr. Irani’s most recent gift helps assure that the USC Village will provide the world-class living and learning environment that our outstanding students deserve, while nurturing their intellectual, creative and personal growth.”

USG kicked off USC’s fourth annual EdMonth on Monday night with “SparkED,” a panel featuring activists who spoke about their work promoting educational justice for traditionally marginalized students.
The panel addressed grassroots initiatives and obstacles to education reforms, particularly within Los Angeles and Chicago. It was moderated by Assistant Director Nnenna Ezeh, a senior majoring in health and humanity.
Malcolm London, a freshman at University of Illinois and a poet-activist known for his spoken word piece “High School Training Ground” performed at TED Talks Education, explained the resource disparities within Chicago’s public education system.
London explained that the problem is not that schools in poorer areas are not producing results — the problem is that those schools do not receive proper attention and funding.
“When on the opposite side of the city [from where the mayor’s children attend school] you have one teacher for every 40 kids, you replace counselors with policemen, and then you underfund these schools and say, well they aren’t being used correctly,’ well whose fault is that?” London said.
London helped organize protests when Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel closed 50 schools, many of which contained a high proportion of minority students, because those schools were labeled as “underutilized.” The protests included up to 15,000 people demonstrating in the streets weekly.
Emily Almendarez, a high school activist involved in the Coalition for Educational Justice and Schools that LA Students Deserve, expanded upon the discussion of inadequate resources.
Almendarez noted the differences between the predominantly Caucasian middle school she attended in the valley and the high school she attended in Koreatown.
Almendarez’s high school had five campuses that shared one nurse, one college counselor and one library.
“There are no resources that indicate that you’re worth going to college,” Almendarez said.
Jose Lara is the vice president at El Rancho Unified School District and a founder of Ethnic Studies Now Coalition, a grassroots group that is working on asking unified school districts in California to require a Ethnic Studies class to be a high school graduation requirement.
Increased efforts to include Ethnic Studies in high school curricula has lead to the implementation of the course in four school districts in California.
Lara discussed that minority students are not exposed to education on the histories, cultures and languages that affect their every day lives and communities because curricula are western-centered.
Director of EdMonth Hannah Nguyen also explained that this year’s panel speaks to the theme “Spark a Movement” because it highlights the power of the student voice so that education reform is approached from a different angle.
Easiest to blame the public schools or teachers, or maybe even urge the  “parents” to care for the child and motivate the child to learn. But the father is unknown and the mother has to work or – worse – is mentally absent through drugs or alcohol. Some parents. What happens then? A gang and the street that raise the child. When children grow up this way, their ability to learn and be productive is rare.  So what is the solution? Throwing money at the problem is a waste.Better funding cannot make up for the horrible non-parents. A potentially effective solution would be for the children to grow up in orphanages, but that is politically not possible. So, in fact, there is no effective solution. Get over it. In our culture, this is what must be.

The three-week USC Mobile Development contest came to a close this past weekend, with two student participants winning the $5,000 prize for creating an app meant to improve the USC registration process.
The competition was hosted by the USC Business Technology Networking Group at the request of Douglas Shook, the dean of academic records, registrar and professor of clinical information and operations management. The Association for Computing Machinery and Applied Statistics Club also took part in organizing the event.
To partake, students had to create a working application for USC’s web registration tool that could be installed and provide live access for all students. Competition guidelines required that the winning team should include distinct features such as an advanced filter system, course recommendations, a list of prerequisites and corequisites and other specialized features unique to the team.
The first place team won a $5,000 cash prize, the second place team won $2,500 and the third place team was awarded $1,000.
Winners of the first place title included siblings, Riley Testut and Kassidy Testut. The duo named their app, Testut Tech. Riley Testut, a freshman majoring in computer science, was the primary coder and his sister Kassidy Testut, a senior majoring in cinematic arts and film and television production, created a commercial for the app and helped generate functionality features for the app.
Kaitlyn Lee, a participant of the competition and member of team Phoenix, explained that she was impressed with Testut Tech because it proved to be unique in comparison to other team apps.
“It was very well done,” Lee said. “When we were looking at their presentation and watching them demo their app, we could tell they put a lot of effort into it. There were a lot of other things they did, different features that we didn’t do and vice versa.”
Team Phoenix, which included USC students Jesse Chand, Kaitlyn Lee, Nikhil Bedi and Ayberk Yilmaz, placed second for the creation of two separate apps. One app was an iOS version and the other was for Android.
After a hackathon at Stanford, Phoenix was able to have iOS designers at Facebook’s Creative Lab review and critique their apps. Phoenix’s iOS app lets users share their schedule directly to Facebook.
According to Lee, creating a mobile app and a revamped version of web registration would aid students.
“People use their phone so much now having a mobile version would make their lives so much easier,” Lee said. “There’s a lot that can be improved with the current web registration system so our goal was ultimately to improve that and make it a good experience for the user.”
Third place winner, team Ca$hM0n3y, wanted to help users view possible schedules before making a decision on their classes.
Group presenter Nathaniel Reardon said their “autoschedule” feature was their app’s unique quality.
“If you had searched for a class that you wanted, you would have the option to click a button that allowed you to ‘auto schedule’ it,” Reardon said. “Then you would go to your auto schedule course bin and you could then swipe left and right to see all the possible combinations of the schedule.”
In addition, Ca$hM0n3y’s app added the ability to search for classes by course code, course description, instructor and diversity requirement.
One of the competition’s organizers, Andrew Valsamaki, said though Ca$hM0n3y’s app had impressive features, there were not enough to move their group into second or first place. The contribution will nonetheless help in improving the app that USC releases.
Lee said she was happy that students were working on the apps they would ultimately use.
“I’m very glad that USC provided us with the opportunity to work on this project,” Lee said. “I think it’s a really great idea to have students helping to come up with ideas on how to make apps for things we can actually use. This app is going to be for student by students, because students have found out how they want this to be implemented. Having the chance to be apart of [the competition] has been incredible.”

Juniors Renat Gabitov and Jon Koehmstedt were selected to attend the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative University program, an annual conference on social entrepreneurship and community development.
Based on the same model as the Clinton Global Initiative, the Clinton Global Initiative University is designed to engage and empower college students to address problems in their communities. This weekend, former President Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea Clinton will host 1,100 students, professionals and philanthropists to develop ideas at CGI U 2015 from March 6 to March 8 at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.
“I’m looking forward to meeting other young people who have a similar mindset … people who go out of their way to do good for others,” said Gabitov, a junior majoring in business administration. “At CGI U, students from across the country and around the world come together in one place to become educated on how to make a social impact.”
Gabitov and Koehmstedt, both transfer students, were selected for the CGIU program as a result of their project plan to create an application to help nonprofits.
“The entire idea of social entrepreneurship is that you see what you can do for money, but you find a tangent to engage and develop the community at the same time,” said Gabitov, who is originally from Moscow, Russia.
Several months ago, Gabitov brought together a team of 10 professionals in marketing, finance and development at the Viterbi Hacker House to brainstorm new business ideas.
“The Viterbi Hacker House is a pool for entrepreneurial thought. It’s a great resource that is really under-utilized … One of the reasons I came to USC was the entrepreneurial culture,” said Koehmstedt, a junior majoring in computer science who works as a student leader in the house.
Out of these meetings came the idea for Delo, a platform for task management. The location-based application allows nonprofit organizations to locate and identify individuals in the community who are interested in volunteering and contributing resources to the organizations. Gabitov and Koehmstedt integrated a social payment component into the app by allowing the organizations to receive crowdfunding from the local community.
“We found that the problem was most nonprofit organizations that are local do not have exposure. They have a really hard time connecting with the local community,” Gabitov said.
To develop the application, Gabitov and Koehmstedt worked with a team composed of USC undergraduate and master students, including Akshaya Shanbhogue, a first-year masters student studying computer science; Kevin Van Beek, a junior majoring in business administration; Anisha Pathak, a freshman majoring in economics and mathematics; Animesh Sinha, a first-year graduate student studying computer science; Samta Jain, a freshman majoring in computer science; and Calvin Leung, a sophomore majoring in computer science. The team is primarily composed of computer science majors, in order to handle the technical aspects of designing the platform. The group has plans to release the application next month.
“I think the most important thing we will get from CGI U program is the networking. Whenever you’re in an environment with 500 students from around the world who are equally passionate to make change, it’s bound to be valuable,” said Koehmstedt, who previously served as a mentor for the Clinton Global Initiative program. “I would love to see USC have a bigger presence there in future years.”
Gabitov and Koehmstedt are looking forward to the mentorship opportunities with the philanthropists and mentors at the conference and competing for funding for their Delo platform project.
All students who are selected for the CGI U program are required to develop their own “commitments to action,” measurable initiatives that address problems in their in local communities, or around the world. The CGI U program is centered on five specific focus areas — education, environment and climate change, peace and human rights, poverty alleviation and public health.
“The CGI U program will be very beneficial for us because we can leverage the network of talented social doers to support us and help us solve problems that we have faced in the development of our app,” Gabitov said.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Gabitov and Koehmstedt were selected to partake in CGI U because of their plan to create the Viterbi Hack House. They actually planned to create the application Delo. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The men’s volleyball team has had a rough last couple of matches. USC (9-4, 8-4 MPSF) dropped from No. 3 to No. 7 nationally. Hence, having a week off could not have come at a better time for the Trojans. They look to come back from their week off with back-to-back wins at home against No. 3 UC Irvine (16-3, 11-2) and UC San Diego (2-15, 0-12 MPSF) Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Trojans have been practicing hard during their week off, honing fundamentals and focusing on their serving and passing skills that have been struggling recently. It should have served as a nice break for the Trojans, who have been constantly traveling and played the full five sets in three of their last six games.
Following the team’s loss to UC Santa Barbara, head coach Bill Ferguson noted that it is critical in future matches that the Trojans focus on one point at a time while on court.
UC Irvine will prove to be a tough match for the Trojans. In their last match in Irvine, the teams battled out to a full five sets (28-30, 25-17, 21-25, 25-23, 15-13). Both teams were undefeated in conference and USC was undefeated overall, and the Trojans went into the match as the underdogs. Pulling out the win in Irvine propelled the Trojans back onto the national stage. The UC Irvine match served as a test for the Trojans, and they passed with flying colors.
Coming into the match as the underdogs once again should motivate the Trojans to regain their victorious mentality and readjust their technique, so they can beat the Anteaters once again.
Junior opposite Josh Kirchner dominated the net for USC with a team-high 15 kills against UCI. Senior setter Micah Christenson and Kirchner both had a team-high two aces. Similar production from the USC offense and service line should translate into slew of points for the Trojans, pushing them to a victory at home.
The two teams have had a vastly different last couple of weeks: UCI has won their last seven matches, while USC has gone 3-4. Hopefully, the Trojans can make a complete 180-degree switch and turn their play into high gear.
If the Trojans can limit sophomore opposite hitters Tamir Hershko and senior Zack La Cavera, they should be able to slow down UC Irvine’s dominant offense. Both make up the teams 13.77 kills per set average and .355 hitting percentage.
USC’s match tomorrow night is against UC San Diego. In their previous match, USC won easily in three-straight sets (25-14, 25-16, 25-19). UCSD has lost in three sets against all conference opponents except two this season (UCI and Stanford). If the Trojans can get back to their fundamentals tonight, then they should ride that momentum for back-to-back wins at home.
A decisive set of wins for the Trojans will help put the team back on the right track as they head into the back end of their schedule with their eyes set on the MPSF and NCAA Tournaments.
See the Trojans take the court at 6 p.m. Tuesday against UC Irvine and Wednesday at 7 p.m. against UC San Diego.

I don’t usually follow the NBA until the playoffs start, but this year, I have been slightly more tuned in throughout the season. I must admit that this is largely because my team has a good shot at going deep into the playoffs. However, this season has given me more reasons to watch than just being a fairweather fan.
Part of my aversion to the NBA regular season is the constant hype that usually surrounds LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. While I openly root against both of these players at every chance I get, I can’t deny their greatness. But since I do dislike Kobe and LeBron, watching regular season NBA games that are all about them makes me uninterested.
Kobe has recently battled injury and is a part of a struggling Lakers team and luckily for me, the Clippers are the better team in L.A. right now, so Kobe’s star is dimming if only slightly. And Kevin Durant has given LeBron a run for his money in the MVP running as of late, but his injury-ridden season has paved the way for another rising star to rival LeBron.
Sunday’s Rockets/Cavs matchup was full of scrappy plays and scuffles between LeBron and the other King James, MVP hopeful James Harden, who leads the NBA in scoring. The game definitely had playoff implications for both teams, which explains why the game went to overtime and was decided in the final seconds.
But I think the biggest takeaway from the game was the intensity and competition between Harden and James. Aside from the constant tussles, the two MVP candidates and their respective teams played a close game that was back and forth through the final seconds of overtime. James and Harden were neck-and-neck the entire competition.
James and Patrick Beverly got into a skirmish that earned them each a technical foul. James and Harden got tangled up many times, one such encounter ended with Harden kicking James in the groin and drawing a technical.
James had 37 points to Harden’s 33 and they each had eight rebounds. LeBron had four assists and Harden had five, while LeBron had three blocks and Harden had one less. Though they were evenly matched, it is hard not to say that the           105-103 Rockets win was decided by a pair of missed free throws by James.
Houston had won five consecutive games to take control of the third seed in the Western Conference. With Dwight Howard out with a knee injury, it’s hard to deny that Harden has emerged as a leader and made a strong case for MVP.
The Cavs on the other hand halted a 10-game winning streak against the Western Conference and held them from moving into the number one spot in the Central Division.
I do think the emergence of Kevin Durant and James Harden marks the downturn of LeBron’s career, as he is already past his peak. And while I support the Rockets and the Thunder and would definitely consider myself a fan of both teams, Durant’s scoring titles and MVPs and Harden’s success this season pale in comparison to LeBron’s four MVPs and two titles.
With that being said, I think the remainder of the season will be very telling of the direction of both Harden and James’ careers. Is there a new King James in town? I personally hope so, but for now that remains to be seen.

Much like his position implies, sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic is always moving forward. Hailing from Belgrade, Serbia, Jovanovic came to the United States in order to pursue a career in basketball.
His father played professionally in Europe for 15 years and gave Jovanovic his first exposure to the game.
“My dad used to be a professional basketball player for 15 years but he never pushed me to play basketball or something like that, it came naturally to me,” Jovanovic said. “I remember I was like 10 years old, and I was watching his highlights and I took his arm and I asked him to make me practice and so he assigned me to a school basketball academy for one year and then to the Red Star Club and I stayed there for seven years.”
Though his father never pushed him to play basketball, Jovanovic says his dad watches all of his games online despite a nine-hour time difference.
“I always get a brief report after every game, something good and something bad,” Jovanovic said. “Usually, even if I play really well he always finds something that I need to do better, which really helps.”
Jovanovic didn’t start playing forward until a growth spurt prompted his coaches to encourage him to give the position a try.
“I’ve only been playing forward for the last three years because I’ve recently grown up,” Jovanovic said. “I was always behind my generation in physical strength so I was always playing two guard, three guard, sometimes point guard. When I turned 16 I was 6[-foot-]7 and coaches were starting to push me to play forward and every year I grew an inch and now I’m 6[-foot-]11 and now I’m always playing forward.”
Jovanovic’s skill and growth garnered him a lot of attention and faced him with a difficult decision when he turned 18. He could either play professionally in Serbia or come to the United States and play college basketball.
“My decision for college was very difficult because I was coming from Serbia and I had a bunch of offers but when I was looking at USC as a school and a basketball program in this town I couldn’t find anything better,” Jovanovic said. “USC was the obvious choice.”
Jovanovic says he is glad he ended up in Los Angeles because he can see that head coach Andy Enfield and USC have already improved his play in just two seasons.
“[Coach Enfield] is like my second dad,” Jovanovic said. “He improved my game systematically and individually. I got a better feeling for the game. I improved my shooting dramatically and I think my game overall got better. Especially since when I came in as a freshman I got the opportunity to play right away.”
Jovanovic chose USC over offers from schools including Arizona, Vanderbilt, Columbia, Gonzaga, Washington and Oregon. Though he has experienced success in the States thus far, he admits that it was never his plan to leave Serbia.
“I never saw myself in the States because I was playing professionally right when I turned 18 and they offered me a six year contract,” Jovanovic said. “But when you play pro over there you’re not able to go to school so I wasn’t able to get a degree and play basketball at a high level at the same time, you have to pick one of the two. I figured in the United States everything is balanced so you can do both at the same time.”
Despite the long distance and cultural differences that separate Los Angeles and Serbia, Jovanovic said he had a very easy transition thanks to his teammates. He is especially close to fellow Serb, junior forward Strahinja Gavrilovic.
“He is from Serbia as well and he is one year older than me and he really helped me to adapt and get a feeling for USC,” Jovanovic said. “The adjustment has been good, especially with great teammates and all the coaches.”
The star forward hopes to earn a degree in business and work in banking investments and stocks should a career in the NBA not work out. Nonetheless, he is confident that he has a future in basketball.
“Hopefully it takes me to the NBA, we’ll see after that,” Jovanovic said. “I think I have a bright future so hopefully that works out.”
Jovanovic has enjoyed following the Clippers and the Lakers since moving to Los Angeles. Aside from his father, who is his biggest role model, he looks up to current NBA stars Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant and his friend and former Trojan standout Nikola Vucevic.
“I like all of those players of course, but I want to build up my own style of game,” Jovanovic said.
Though Jovanovic and the Trojans have struggled this season, posting an 11-18 overall and 3-14 conference record, he is excited about the promise his team has shown.
“We’re the youngest team in the top five power conferences and we are mainly a freshman and sophomore squad,” Jovanovic said. “We’re so young and talented but we have a lot of potential. This year has been frustrating because maybe on paper we have better players but we lose close games because we are not able to score in the last five minutes and we have a lack of experience in our team but it’s going to turn around.”
Jovanovic and the Trojans travel to Westwood on Wednesday to take on rivals UCLA in their last game of the season.

The USC baseball team is looking to continue its winning streak today against the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos. The Trojans (12-0) kept their winning streak alive last weekend with a      three-game sweep against the Fordham University Rams (1-8).
USC rallied for a couple of one-run victories on Friday and Saturday but completed the series sweep in dominant fashion on Sunday, defeating the Rams 10-1. The Trojans benefitted from an offensive outburst Sunday highlighted by a seven-run rally in the bottom of the fourth inning.
The Trojans got big contributions from many different players, as redshirt junior outfield Bobby Stahel, senior catcher Garrett Stubbs and junior outfield Timmy Robinson combined to go 6-for-11 with six runs scored and two RBI. USC got on the board in the bottom of the first inning with a two-run rally but broke the game open in the bottom of the fourth.
Senior second baseman Dante Flores tied his career-high with five RBI on the day, including a three-run home run to cap the Trojans’ seven-run outburst in the fourth.
The most dominant performance of the day, however,  came from the other side of the ball. Freshman starter Mitch Hart impressed for the Trojans, tossing seven innings while allowing only one unearned run on two hits and a walk. Hart needed only 94 pitches through his seven innings of work to earn his second win of the season. Relief pitchers freshman Mason Perryman and sophomore Andrew Wright combined for the eighth and ninth innings to lock down USC’s 12th-straight win.
The Trojans will travel to face the UCSB Gauchos (8-3) today as they look to extend their winning streak behind junior starting pitcher Tyler Gilbert. USC head coach Dan Hubbs said he’s excited about the winning streak but the team is focused on the games ahead.
“I think the kids have really bought into the idea that we never know which game is going to be the one that knocks you out of playing in the postseason,” Hubbs said. “We were so close last year and maybe there was a game or two that we should have won that we didn’t, so we just make sure we keep up the energy and never take a day off.”
UCSB is coming off a weekend in which it went 1-2 against the No. 12 Oregon Ducks. Though they dropped two out of three games against Oregon, the Gauchos might be riding a wave of momentum after they shut out the Ducks in the series finale on Sunday, 1-0.
The Trojans will be put to the test against the Gauchos, who feature a strong duo in the middle of their order. Outfielder Cameron Newell (.425 batting average) and designated hitter Robby Nesovic (.432 batting average) have powered the UCSB offense thus far in the season, and shutting them down will be crucial to the Trojans’ success.
“If you look at UCSB’s game against Pepperdine last week, [Newell and Nesovic] had big days and really gave them a chance to win,” Hubbs said. “Tyler is just going to need to be able to execute pitches, work the ball in and out and throw his off-speed pitches for strikes so that we can keep them off balance.”
The USC baseball program has been projecting confidence all season long with strong playoff aspirations, but they will face their greatest challenge yet in a string of tough games coming up later this week.
After facing a solid UCSB team tonight, the Trojans will prepare for the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic this weekend. With games against three nationally ranked teams in Vanderbilt, TCU and UCLA, USC will get its first real chance to prove it can compete with the elite programs in the country. Hubbs echoed that this week could be a big opportunity for the USC baseball program, but it will not necessarily make or break the rest of their season.
“I don’t think [this week] is the be-all end-all, but I think we could make a statement to everybody,” Hubbs said. “We’re playing four quality opponents this week and I think it will be a good test for our guys, but we’re going to have to beat these kinds of quality teams [once league play starts] anyway.”

A little more than a month ago, FOX debuted its newest pilot Backstrom, starring Rainn Wilson in a role entirely different from that of his Dwight Schrute in NBC’s comedy The Office. In the show, Wilson plays Det. Lt. Everett Backstrom, a genius detective in Portland, Oregon. On the poster, Wilson’s character is billed as “BRILLIANT DETECTIVE. TOTAL D*CK.” Backstrom is also described as “offensive” and “irascible,” and according to Brian Lowry — a TV columnist for Variety — he is yet another “anti-social savant” that television executives love to churn out in droves.
Perhaps the most famous character that fits this detective archetype is that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes. Hyper-intelligent and a bit of a recluse, Holmes has been reiterated into not one, not two, but three versions in recent years. Director Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes film starring Robert Downey Jr., BBC’s Sherlock television series that launched Benedict Cumberbatch into superstardom, and finally CBS’s Elementary starring Johnny Lee Miller, with the talented Lucy Liu in the gender-swapped version of Dr. Watson.
Holmes in all of the versions is smart, socially inept and undoubtedly the star. All three versions also happen to be smash hits, requiring more films and more seasons as the years push on. Downey has even taken the smug genius to another mythology with his character Tony Stark in Marvel’s Iron Man — a franchise that has earned over $2 billion to date. If we push further into the brainiac mythos, there’s FOX’s House M.D. starring Hugh Laurie as the irreverent, mean, rude and almost always right Dr. Gregory House (a character actually based on Sherlock Holmes). The popularity of the show catapulted it into eight seasons and remains one of FOX’s most successful series to date.
Clearly, this model has and does work. Not simply America, but the world at large enjoys watching a white male run around his chosen world solving mysteries. In his way, Sherlock is his own superhero — he “fights crime” and seems to have superhuman capabilities and pretty much always saves the day. In short, Sherlock Holmes sells. But it begs the question: where’s our female Sherlock? And no, I’m not settling for Lucy Liu as the female Dr. Watson.
Here’s why: Two days ago, Michelle Rodriguez — most notable for being the tough yet lovable car chick in the hyped-up, macho Fast and Furious franchise — told TMZ that minorities should “stop stealing all the white people’s superheroes.” Later, she cleared up her statement by saying: “Instead of trying to turn a girl character into a guy or instead of trying to turn a white character into a black character or a Latin character, I think that … people should make an effort in Hollywood to develop their own mythology.”
Like Rodriguez said, I don’t think we should have a literal female Sherlock on air. Her name doesn’t have to be Sharon Holmes and she doesn’t need to live in a cute London flat with her best girlfriend Joan Watson. But we do need a protagonist who is strong, smart, invaluable and also a woman. Yet, I feel as a culture we have a tendency to pigeonhole women who exhibit these qualities.
When asked about her “notorious sadist” boss in The Devil Wears Prada, Anne Hathaway’s character declared, “O.K., she’s tough, but if Miranda were a man, no one would notice anything about her, except how great she is at her job.” Despite the fact that this movie opened 10 years ago, this bias continues to extend into Hollywood’s female leads today. A woman who acts like a man, per se, isn’t readily accepted and is most often called derogatory names in order to pull her down from her high status. We have yet to open up the gender inequality in terms of smart women in television and film who are in charge and maintain control, yet whom audiences are also willing to respect, admire and (maybe most importantly in this extremely economic industry) give their dollars to.
In September, NBC premiered its show The Mysteries of Laura — a comedy pilot about a brilliant detective (played by Will & Grace’s Debra Messing) who attempts to balance her job with her “chaotic home life” of raising two boys and dealing with her ex-husband. While I feel this might be a step in the right direction, Messing’s character is by default defined by her feminine duties. Where is the character that need not be defined as a mom or a wife — two titles that are inherently linked with men — in addition to fighting crime, but defined as simply herself, imperfection and all?
Sherlock does not need a woman. In fact, he’s often described as asexual, and in one of Doyle’s novels he is cited as saying, “I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind.” So then, if we were to create this Holmes-inspired woman, can we untether the female detective from her male binds? Could audiences handle it?
In the press, famous comedienne and actress Tina Fey has often come head to head with the apparent age-old question of whether women can be funny or not. In a Vanity Fair article entitled, “Who Says Women Aren’t Funny?” Fey is quoted as saying that though people still say women aren’t funny, “it’s just a lot easier to ignore [now].” Clearly, the culture has made way for women in the male-dominated comedy world.
Furthermore, in an op-ed in The New York Times, writer Maureen Dowd has declared the emergence of a phenomenon she named “Dirty Words from Pretty Mouths,” describing the trend of raunchiness from female writers and directors. Increasingly, women are seen exploring formerly taboo sexuality with more apparent ease and free will than ever before. These subjects are also used most frequently in the name of comedy — Lena Dunham’s Girls is the easiest example, as is the 2011 raunchy comedy mega hit Bridesmaids, written by two women: Kristin Wiig and Annie Mumolo.
So, if women have transcended the comedy-sexuality boundary — at least somewhat — and have officially declared that women can actually be funny and sexual, let’s make way for the woman who’s also smart, brash, solves crimes and yes, maybe, can be a little rough around the edges, but it doesn’t matter because the community desperately needs her for her powerful brains. We’re well into 2015, and I think we’re ready for Ingenious Words from Pretty Mouths, now — mouths that also can rake in $2 billion and counting.

Oh, sure.  There needs to be a female Sherlock Holmes.  Right after we have a White Martin Luther King and a break dancing “Ironsides”.  I love Lucy Liu, and a female investigator (private or public) has long been accepted.  Especially on TV.  But…don’t take a stock, historical character and put them through a sex change.   Think of a new character.

Alongside Half and Half, Cup o’ Joy and Volcano Tea House comes the newest addition to quench USC’s tea obsession. Located opposite the popular restaurants Bacaro L.A. and Nature’s Brew on Hoover Street, Rewts Tea Bar offers a plethora of specialty teas, boba and coffee for those late nights or just for a simple cup of tea.
Known as bubble tea, pearl milk tea or simply boba, the Taiwanese tea-based beverage has taken Southern California by storm. The Taiwanese drink is a simple mixture of sweetened tea with milk and a chewy topping. The demand for boba milk tea has driven many shops to favor speed over taste however. Many stores use powders for a quick milk tea, and boil, then refrigerate, large amounts of tapioca pearls at one time. During the blending process, most stores powder, sugar and shake in an assembly line. This often leaves the boba with a rubbery texture and the milk tea tasting similar to a ready-made, instant mixture.
Co-owner Tony Chen, being a tea enthusiast himself, felt the need to provide the public with quality service and ingredients.
“People deserve better and I can do better,” Chen said.
In just a couple of months since its Dec. 14 grand opening, Rewts has received positive reviews as well as a very high rate of returning customers -— some four times a week and others who visit twice a day.
“All items are made from scratch, can be made cold or hot, with or without milk,” Chen said. “Everything is very customizable.”
True to its word, Rewts spares no expense to provide the very best for the customers. Down to the minutest detail, this tea bar always keeps the consumer’s health and satisfaction in mind. Each page of the menu not only categorizes drinks by type but also by nutrition and calories. Not many other stores go the extra mile and offer the option to replace an entire drink if it failed to meet the customer’s expectation.
“Ingredients are G.M.O-free. We use Stevia sweetener which is diabetic-safe,” Chen said. “For a drink place, the sweetener is the most important part of the recipe.”
The purpose of this is to give customers the sweetness without the negative impacts of regular sugar and corn syrup.
The store includes a variety of classic favorites and enough exotic flavors to satisfy the most skeptical customer.
“One of our main goals was to introduce people to a more interesting way of having tea,” Chen said. “We serve it plain, blended with milk, and tea blended with juices.”
During those hot So Cal afternoons, Rewts provides refreshing ice-blended drinks. For a quick picker upper, customers can’t go wrong with the “latteas,” or milk teas. Notably, this tea bar’s most impressive menu would have to be their tea sangrias, which blends the tangy taste of juice and expertly brewed tea. In addition to a variety of organic teas and all-natural boba, Rewts serves a limited coffee selection. Coffee fans can feel at home with Rewt’s shakerato: a shot of expresso shaken over ice, with a dash of simple syrup and topped off with their sweetener.
Of course, every new store faces its own set of problems. Though Rewts has had some rough patches, it has continually improved their already efficient operations without sacrificing quality. Customers crave Rewts’ boba so much that the store occasionally runs out before closing time. Yet the hazel hue of the tapioca isn’t the only difference between Rewts and other tea stores.
“It’s sweet and the starch itself is subtly sweet. That’s why most places start soaking it in sweetener to give it flavor,” Chen said. “Rewts uses turbinado sugar or raw sugar to enhance its natural flavor instead of trying to make it taste like something else, like honey.”
Some of their best sellers include their house-blend tea, a black tea with a slight floral finish, as well as the taro from their milk tea menu. The taro milk drink comes with small chunks of real taro. From their tea sangria menu, customers often ask for the blood orange and the Formosa.
Rewt’s modern decor and spacious interior welcome casual diners for a sociable afternoon or a quiet study space. Customers can sit near the bar and watch their drinks as they are crafted.
“Our main focus is for customers to be able to use this space how they want so they can enjoy their time here. That’s why the layout is kind of open,” Chen said. “You can choose a place where you feel comfortable. At the grass in the front, the back or at the bar.”
With a variety of regular teas, milk teas, ice-blended drinks, coffee and tea sangrias, Rewts boasts a spectrum of refreshments for both the casual tea drinker and the caffeine addict. Unlike a regular cafe, however, Rewts Tea Bar combines the experience of both a tea shop and a coffee house.
Expect to wait slightly longer than at a regular tea stop. Each drink is carefully tailor-made, which takes a little bit of time, but is worth the wait.
“Our ways of doing things are more geared towards being eco-friendly and healthy. And towards people who are conscious about their lives and having things healthy,” Chen said. “We really care about what we do.”

The group consisting of brothers Jean Paul Makhlouf and Alex Makhlouf, along with Samuel Frisch, along with a slew of other names gaining ground in the EDM scene took over Avalon nightclub in Hollywood last Friday night.
Opener Sam Hiller along with duo Riggi and Piros set up the stage for what was to be an electrifying night. Hiller slowly brought the venue to life through his ever accelerating blend of dance and deep house. On the other end of the spectrum, Riggi and Piros brought a surprising energy driven Big Room, setting the bar high for the headliner to follow.
Cash Cash came on to thunderous applause, bringing everyone in the house to their feet and bouncing to their electronica infused adaptation of dance music. They played classics such as “Overtime,” along with their newest hit “Surrender” that has been making waves all over the dance scene. They also premiered remixes of songs such as Queen’s “We Will Rock You” to Capital Cities’ “Safe in Sound.” Cash Cash also displayed a startling variety in their choice of music. They explored genres as wide ranging as Jungle Trap to Moobahton, displaying their versatile producing talents in the best way possible.
Their two hour long set utilized Avalon’s lighting and sound systems to the maximum, with lasers and fog systems activated in tune to the catchy drops and smooth melodies that comprise their music. The bass reverberated with an intensity that was not too overwhelming yet forced everyone onto the huge dance floor. They debuted not one, but two unreleased tracks through the course of the night, giving the Avalon crowd something to go home and brag about.
Overall, Cash Cash played a stellar set to a packed club venue, displaying their skills at adept mixing and transitions, and created lasting memories for all those involved.

Fifty-five years ago, Fidel Castro made a deal with the Soviet Union and publicly denounced “Yankee imperialism.” For President Dwight Eisenhower, that was enough to justify cutting off all trade with Cuba, and later all diplomatic relations, in the name of ending communism.
Following the embargo, the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis proved that the sanctions were necessary in that context. But now, decades later, Cuba is still communinst, impoverished and separated from the world.
While the country’s embargo was originally related to solely thwarting the spread of communism, the country is now considered to be a state sponsor of terrorism. This designation was put into place when the country supported ETA and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia decades ago. The State Department’s most recent report on the countries under this designation, however, presented very little evidence that Cuba is still a state sponsor of terrorism.
In fact, the report only mentions one terrorist organization in communication with Cuba, ETA, and then states that they are currently eliminating ties with ETA. The report also discusses Cuba’s influence in peace talks between FARC and Columbia, and explicitly states “there was no indication that the Cuban government provided weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups.”
The other countries on the United State’s terror list are Iran, Syria and Sudan. Iran’s offenses include directly aiding terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Hizballah, Shia militant groups and many others, as well as failing to prosecute Al Qaeda members and operating a nuclear program that is outside the boundaries designated by the international community. Sudan harbors Al Qaeda, the Lord’s Resistance Army and Hamas members. Syria’s offenses are no better, as they feature a chemical weapons program and support for organizations such as Al Qaeda.
Just one skim through the report makes it clear that the other countries on this list present clear terrorist threats and that Cuba does not.
Our problem with Cuba, then, is not a terrorist problem; rather, it is a personal problem. Because most of our country’s leaders were around during the Cold War, the United States is still operating under outdated Cold War ideology. Cuba is still seen as a country that needs to be monitored closely like a time bomb.
The United States used to be afraid of Cuba, which we labeled communist. The only difference is that now we are afraid of Cuba and calling them terrorists.
The issue with this logic is that they are not a threat to us as either terrorists or communists. “At a time when we are focused on threats from Al Qaeda to ISIL, a nation that meets our conditions and renounces the use of terrorism should not face this sanction,” President Barack Obama said of Cuba in December.
Instead of sanctioning Cuba, we should instead be engaging in diplomacy with them on how to repair their economy.
Under the Bush administration, the United States claimed to be fighting for freedom in Cuba by keeping embargos in place. But there have been no successful revolutions against the Castro regime as the United States hoped. This leaves Cuba still poor and still communist.
If what the United States wants is better conditions in Cuba, releasing Cuba from the terror list must be its first step. The sanctions we have in place have clearly not improved anything for the country, and an embargo lift could be the start to a diplomatic relationship between the two countries.

Since the surprise announcement of reconciliation between Cuba and the United States, Presidents Barack Obama and Raúl Castro have had two meetings to work on negotiations. The historic first meeting took place in Havana, and last week, American and Cuban officials congregated again to work out diplomacy. Amid the peace talks, however, Cuba still remains on the State Department’s terror list, joined by states such as Iran, Syria and Sudan. Though removing Cuba from the terror list would spur more amiable relations, United States officials should ultimately put national security over foreign diplomacy.
From the Cuban standpoint, it is understandable why the nation’s inclusion as a threat to the United States and the world is an offensive title. According to the State Department, any changes made to the terror list would require an extensive process. Therefore, Cuban pressure to amend the list is superfluous. Moreover, the head of the Cuban delegation, Josefina Vidal, should realize that opening embassies and supporting trade between the two nations does not require Cuba to be taken off the terror list. Apparently, one of Cuba’s conditions for diplomacy is removal from the list. “It would be very easy to restore diplomatic relations, if they would not link those two things,” a State Department official disclosed.
Indeed, the relationship between Cuba and the United States and the United States’ national security are two completely different things. The stability of the state of the union should factor in the Cuban exile community in Florida, obvious opponents of the negotiation. Additionally, two weeks ago, more than 200 protesters were arrested in Cuba for their support of the Ladies in White, a oppositional movement consisting of the wives and female relatives of jailed dissidents. According to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, these efforts by the Cuban government symbolize escalated “repression, harassment and incarceration” from the Castro dictatorship. Compromising their protests denotes that “it’s clear there is zero intent on behalf of the Castro dictatorship to engage in a genuine conversation that centers around bringing freedom to the island’s residents.”
The regime, which is in a state of unrest, presents a dangerous intrusion on American affairs and should remain on the list until human rights are rightfully awarded to the Cuban people. Measures that focus on other agendas during negotiation will not impede upon the reduction of antagonism between the United States and Cuba.
Even more alarmingly, many United States fugitives are still in the custody of Cuba. Sen. Robert Menendez warned, “The Castro regime has a long track record of providing sanctuary to terrorists and harboring U.S. fugitives.” Menendez cited that ever since 1959, many who were wanted for murder, arms trafficking and hijacking in the United States sought refuge in Cuba. A State Department statistic from 2007 stated that 70 American fugitives were stationed in Cuba. In order to not be a threat to United States security, Cuba should return American fugitives so they can face proper jurisdiction in the American legal system. Then, negotiations to subtract the nation from the terror list can resume.
These recent meetings between the United States and Cuba represent a step in the right direction. National security, however, should always take precedent, and that starts with Cuba remaining on the terror list until they meet us halfway.

One of the most loved (or dreaded, if you’re a couch potato like me) traditions of Japanese primary education is the sports festival. Classes are assigned a team color and pitted against each other. The school grounds are opened for cheering parents. The warm sound of shouting and laughter drifts through the air. When I was in Japan two years ago, I had watched a sports festival at my host sister’s elementary school, cooing along with the parents as we watched children toddle through all manners of obstacle courses. This Monday, it was finally my turn to compete.
The sports festival I participated in was a collaborative event planned by the two main international circles of Waseda University. Japanese and foreign students alike mingled and ran wild throughout the gym, playing dodgeball, running relays and jumping rope. Tug-of-war was ferocious. Six ropes, worth 10 points each, had been left in the middle of the room; we were to race to them, and then tug them back to our respective goals. The planners, all of whom had quite a sense of humor, also decided to throw in an extra, 25-point “golden snitch”—in the form of a pair of lacy panties. The end of the festival was crowned by a muscle contest, in which students were given a chance to show off their bulging biceps (or, in my case, lack thereof) through planks, pushups and arm-wrestling contests.
The game that stood out the most for me, though, was called Kiba-Sen, translated as “cavalry battle.” Four people form a team; three on the bottom, joining hands to become a “horse,” with the final person (retaining their human identity) riding on top. Opposing teams then charge at each other, with the riders on top vying to snatch each others’ headbands. In our case, however, these were metamorphosed into flamboyant purple afros. I, by the way, was given the role of the horse’s left flank.
At the end of the day, I was sweaty, tired and bruised by dodgeballs. But, somewhere along the way, I had come to realize why Japanese schools prize the sports festival so much. There’s something about adrenaline and endorphins that bonds people together like nothing else. Add in a pair of lace-panties, and there’s your formula to camaraderie.

Tomorrow, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be delivering a controversial address before Congress about policies affecting Iran’s nuclear program. The subject of the address, however, has nothing to do with the controversy.
What makes this meeting odd is that Netanyahu was invited by Speaker of the House John Boehner who failed to inform the administration of the invitation, Netanyahu has chosen to make this visit two weeks before Israeli elections, stating that he is on a “fateful, even historic mission,” and President Obama, who believes the prime minister merely coming because of election politics, has refused to meet with Netanyahu.
Both citizens and members of Congress should be alarmed by this political game. Netanyahu’s visit is the result of two acts of political sabotage. First, Netanyahu’s acceptance of Boehner’s invitation suggests that the Prime Minister is more interested in his own political advancement than in the increasingly strained relationship he retains with the President of his nation’s most vital ally. Second, Boehner’s invitation undermines the traditional role of President as Head of State and communicates a blatant lack of respect for the administration and an unwillingness to extend even the most basic courtesy from one branch of government to the other.
Each of these flagrant violations of cordiality should be worrying to the American people.
To start, the President of the United States is intended to be a figurehead for the nation. It is not uncommon or unreasonable for this figurehead to be criticized, mocked and disrespected by members of the opposing party within our own country, but when our figurehead is disrespected by a foreign entity, the entire nation should feel disrespected. Netanyahu has now set a negative precedent that the executive branch can been seen as irrelevant and ignored. Though this view would be damaging if held by an enemy, it is an even more cutting insult that this view is held by an ally. Netanyahu’s acceptance of Boehner’s invitation delegitimizes presidential authority in foreign relations, and in a time where foreign affairs are increasingly important to the country’s safety, a delegitimized President is a very worrying proposition.
Additionally, if our government cannot extend the basic courtesy of communicating within branches and across party lines, all hopes of compromise, diplomacy, and bipartisanship in this country are lost. The pressing policy decisions made on the Hill, like the United States’ decisions regarding the nuclear program in Iran, should not be tainted by petty political pissing matches.
Members of government cannot possibly hope that we will trust them if they cannot trust one another. Netanyahu and Boehner need to reevaluate their priorities and begin to put policies over politics.

This morning I was talking with my roommate/best friend as we simultaneously brushed our teeth and checkout ourselves in the mirror. We realized that we have few minutes like this in our busy days where we just stop and have to time to be alone with our thoughts. It actually took me a minute to realize that I was even brushing my teeth. My face became pale as she told me this was her first moment in the past 3 days where she was actually mindful with what she was doing…and without her cell phone.
I felt my life flash right in front of me as I walked through my daily routine in my head. Rarely do I unplug and let myself just breathe. If I’m not in class, at lacrosse practice or taking a break to eat, then I am on my phone or listening to music. I don’t walk through campus without headphones and really soak it all in.
I want to change that. I want to be more appreciative of the little things, which is something that I think all of us have put forth as a goal before, but being present in the moment is one of the hardest things about life.
Though technology has many obvious benefits, the connectivity that we have acquired has ironically disconnected us from the real world. Here are some reasons to stop and unplug, which I think you already know by now!
1. Connection.  The more time you are apart from your cellular device, the more you are open and able to associate to the special people in your life.
2. Mindfulness. You miss things when you are constantly on your phone. Think about all of the times when you were bored and instead you turned to your phone. Look up from your phone and put it away! You will be so surprised at how many more things you appreciate.
3. Mental Clarity. When you put your phone away you instantly feel this burden is lifted from you. I find that all my obligations towards other people sort of float away and I can really focus on myself.
4. A Waste of Time. In the end of the day, cellular communication is for just that — communication. We live in a world where our connectivity somehow seems to determines our self worth. It almost is perceived that if other people aren’t constantly surrounding us and not on social media then there is something “wrong” with us. That is where we are wrong. Social media and communication are useful tools, but we should never forget that real life connectivity is the healthiest.

Manchester City’s 2-1 home defeat to Barcelona in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 was a stumble, but their second half performance saved them from a face plant.
As Sergio Agüero deftly tucked the ball into the back of the net to cut Barcelona’s lead in half midway through the second period, City fans could not help but let their minds roam. Was this yet another epic comeback in the making, a stunt they pulled off in the group stage against Bayern Munich?
Well, not quite.
Still, City’s second half performance was an absolute masterpiece. The effort was valiant, as a number of City players noticeably elevated their games after the interval. The team’s ability to weather the tempest and to turn the tide of the match in the latter 45 minutes was nothing short of remarkable. City waddled through the first half with little vigor and faced a two-goal deficit within the opening half-hour, thanks to poacher Luis Suárez, but the second half brought City optimism and promise — and an all-important goal.
To say that Manuel Pellegrini’s side had their backs against the wall in the first half would be an understatement. City were experiencing the cruel treatment Barcelona so often inflict on their victims. They were trapped in Barcelona’s intricate labyrinth of mesmerizing passing and intricate footwork. City chased the ball—and the game—and could not find an escape from Barcelona’s incessant offensive pressure.
It was, however, evident from the onset of the second period that City were a different team, full of newfound energy and gumption. The proof? Just a few seconds into the half, they won a corner. Barcelona clearly had to turn off cruise control for the second half because City came out flying.
They were placing more and more pressure on the Barcelona defense, but precious seconds were ticking away and the scoreboard still read 2-0 in favor of the visitors. Sergio Agüero was displaying his usual energy, while Samir Nasri and David Silva were looking increasingly threatening on the flanks.
Chance after chance went begging, leaving City with nothing to show for their efforts. Edin Džeko squandered a handful of chances, but City arguably did not deserve to level the scoring so soon after awakening from their first-half stupor (read as: Barcelona had 62% of the possession in this game and City were wildly subpar in the first half).
The high-press defense was working for City early in the second half, as Fernando and James Milner corralled stray balls in the midfield and managed to keep possession for extended periods of time in Barcelona’s half. Džeko was throwing his weight around in and around the box, as he drew attention to himself as a goal-scoring threat. City forced turnovers and won a few corner kicks, some of which were nearly converted into goals. It had taken 45 minutes for Pellegrini’s troops to find their legs, but they were finally playing like the defending Premier League champions.
At times, City gave Barcelona a taste of their own medicine by keeping possession, as they waited for spaces to open and then played incisive passes to forwards and wingers. They had grabbed the game by the scruff of its neck and put Barcelona on their heels.
The faithful at the Etihad could feel the breakthrough coming.
The Champions League gods rewarded City for their efforts in the 69th minute, as Sergio Agüero beat Marc-André ter Stegen after a goal that was as tenacious as it was skillful.
In an eerie turn of events, Barcelona players like Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi were caught in possession in their own half. City amped up the pressure and looked like they might grab a second goal while their momentum was still sky-high.
Despite Gaël Clichy’s second yellow card and subsequent sending off, reducing City to ten men with just under 20 minutes remaining, the Sky Blues defended with all their might. The penalty giveaway by Pablo Zabaleta in the final minute of stoppage time was a heart-in-mouth experience for the home crowd, but Joe Hart fended off Lionel Messi’s spot kick and kept City’s hopes of advancing intact. It was a miraculous moment.
A harbinger of what is to come?
City fans certainly hope so. The late plot twist gone awry for Barcelona will undoubtedly serve as added momentum and motivation for City as they prepare for Act II on March 18.
City might have emerged from the post-Clichy ejection unscathed, but overall, the 2-1 defeat was a disappointment.
Playing with ten men obviously affected Pellegrini’s substitution tactics. Jesús Navas or Frank Lampard could have been brought on in an attempt to draw City level had they not been at a man disadvantage, but instead it was outside-back Bacary Sagna who was brought on in relief. The collateral damage from the red card could have been catastrophic, but City’s defense frantically warded off danger time and time again in the game’s closing moments.
The lack of center-mid Yaya Touré was a tough pill to swallow, especially when you factor in Touré’s physicality and his ability to somewhat effortlessly dominate the middle of the park. But the defensive unit as a whole obviously had their hands full with Barcelona’s countless weapons, including outside backs Jori Alba and Dani Alves, who are pacey down the wings and are more than willing to join the attack.
Success at the Nou Camp may seem impossible at first blush, but City will stand a chance if they can shore up the play from their back line and can put away an early chance in the second leg.
A 2-1 defeat at the Etihad was certainly not the result the Citizens were seeking, but they are heading to Cataluña with a seed of hope and, in turn, a realistic prospect of advancing to the last eight.
Don’t pencil in Barcelona for a quarterfinal spot just yet.

Are you feeling like going into a food coma? Having a food baby? Gaining two pounds in one meal? If you answered yes to any (or all) of the above, then Fogo de Chao is where you want to go next.
Fogo is located in 800 Figueroa Street, just a couple of minutes away from campus. Make sure to call in earlier and make a reservation, because it is bound to be packed. To be able to afford Fogo de Chao, you will have to save up a week worth of meals, because that college budget of yours will take a hit. The meal costs $70 per person…plus tip. But don’t worry about that, because you will definitely eat your $70 worth of food.
The place itself is cavern looking, dimly lit, with servers running around with meat on skewers and dressed in traditional Brazilian clothing. They will sit you at your table and explain the basics of how the restaurant works:
You get a paper disk with a red sign on one side and a green sign on the other. Whenever you want meat, you have to place the green side up and whenever you’re done you place the red side up. The salad bar is buffet-style and open throughout your meal for you to enjoy it as much as you can.

The meat is simply spectacular. Here are 17 different kinds and, by the end of the meal, you’ve forgotten which one’s which. They have pork chops, filet mignon, chicken wrapped in bacon, rib eye — just about everything that you can imagine! It is heaven for carnivores and hell for vegetarians.
Servers will keep roaming around the restaurant, so you can turn your disk green at anytime and make them come your way. If you want anything in particular, the menu also has everything listed with pictures, so you can always ask your server. The menu, by the way, is not there for you to order because everything that’s in it is included. Plus, the portions that they give you are small enough that it allows you to try everything they have.
As side dishes, you get unlimited amounts of fried bananas, baked potatoes and cheese bread. Let’s talk about that bread. Pão de Queijo is a type of authentic Brazilian bread wrapped around a bundle of cheese. They bring it to you straight from the stove, so it’s not only deliciously warm but also the perfect blend between doughy and cheesy. And if by the time you’re done with the meat, you’ll still be wondering if $70 was worth it, all you need to have more bread. I definitely had $70 worth of cheesy bread.
Miranda Mazariegos | Daily Trojan
For me, Fogo de Chao was not so much about the taste of the food (though it is wonderful), but the experience. Fogo is not an Americanized Brazilian restaurant, but rather a chain that was brought to the USA all the way from Brazil, so you definitely get a taste of how a meat restaurant works over there. From the overwhelming amount of food, to the good service and the overdose on cheese bread, Fogo is definitely an experience you must have at least once in your life.

For those of you who may be following these posts, I mentioned last week that we were expected to get a snowstorm last week in Amman, one that threatened to shut the city down for days and merited a massive Safeway run to stock up on basic foods and plenty of water.
Well, the storm didn’t happen then, but this past weekend when we were significantly less prepared — we actually ran out of water on Saturday — we were greeted with three days of wind, snow and ice.
We got about five inches of snow, which is pretty catastrophic for Amman, and haven’t had school since Thursday! Snow completely debilitates the city because they don’t have many snow plows, and because of that the area in our neighborhood was never cleared, we just had to wait for the snow to melt. Blizzards are pretty uncommon here, to say the least; snow covered palm trees was something I never I expected to see in my lifetime.
Walking around the empty streets on Friday once again felt post-apocalyptic, absolutely nobody was out and the roads were blanketed in snow. We joked that we felt like the first explorers of Amman, stomping the first bootprints into the fresh powder, that is, until we turned a corner and saw a bunch of children singing Frozen and building a snowman and we happily joined in. So given that nothing in our area was cleared of snow, we couldn’t really go anywhere most of the weekend. But after three years spent in sunny, weatherless Southern California, a snow day (or three) was much appreciated. I spent most of the weekend snowed in, watching Parks and Recreation, eating frozen pizza in bed and playing cards with my roommates — and it was perfect.
Five days later, the city is still recovering, and we’re still not back to a normal school schedule. But this weekend promises 70-degree weather and sun, a true transformation from the blizzard of the past weekend, and the snow will quickly melt, inshallah.
