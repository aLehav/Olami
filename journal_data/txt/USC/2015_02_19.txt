The USC men’s basketball team (10-16, 2-12 Pac-12) ended its win streak at one, as the Trojans lost to the Arizona Wildcats (23-3, 11-2 Pac-12) on Thursday, Feb. 19 by a score of 87-57.
The Wildcats outplayed the Trojans throughout the entire game, led by freshman forward and Pac-12 Player of the Year candidate Stanley Johnson, who had a well-rounded game with 13 points, seven rebounds and six assists.
For USC, freshman guard Elijah Stewart played with a lot of energy and was productive on the defensive end with a pair of blocks, while sophomore guard Julian Jacobs proved once again why he is the captain of the team. Even in a losing effort, Jacobs played with abandon, as he drove to the hoop and was the vocal leader on the court. Jacobs finished with 13 points, six rebounds and four assists. Freshman forward Malik Martin led the team in scoring with 15 points, and he even made a shot from behind the arc.
Johnson led the charge in the second half as the Wildcats secured the win, but he was joined by a balanced roster. Sophomore forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and senior guard T.J. McConnell contributed to the victory. Hollis-Jefferson had 12 points and seven rebounds, while McConnell added 10 points and seven assists.
The Trojans came out of the gate making it look like a competitive game, but shortly thereafter, the Wildcats proved why they are a top 10 team in the nation. In the first half alone, the Wildcats had 13 assists on 19 made baskets, and they outrebounded USC 21-12. Arizona was sparked by junior center Kaleb Tarczewski, who scored 13 points in the first half and had a pair of thunderous dunks to get the crowd going and lead his team to an 18-point lead at the half. He finished the game with 15 points and nine rebounds.
The Arizona crowd was pumped up the entire night, as the university honored alum Jason Terry by retiring his jersey. Terry played for the Wildcats from 1995-1999 and holds the record for the most steals in program history with 245. The current Wildcats honored the NBA champion by performing the “jet” celebration after every made 3-pointer. Terry became the fifth Wildcat to have his jersey hung in the rafters of the McKale Center.
The Trojans will stay in the desert for the weekend, as they next take on the Arizona State Sun Devils (14-12, 6-7). This will be the first meeting between the two teams this season. Arizona State is led by head coach Herb Sendek, leading scorer junior guard Gerry Blakes and leading rebounder sophomore forward Savon Goodman.
Arizona State is coming off a close victory over the UCLA Bruins (16-11, 8-6), and they currently sit at eighth in the conference standings. The game will tip off at 5:30 pm on Feb. 22 at the Wells-Fargo Arena.

The Marshall School of Business hosted a discussion, “What a Communication Perspective Brings to the Study of Organizations,” as part of the school’s Expert Speakers Series in Business Communication, at Ronald Tutor Hall on Thursday evening.
The keynote guest speaker was Dr. Stanley Deetz, professor emeritus at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Other panelists included Valerie Folkes, professor of marketing; Patricia Riley, director of master of arts in global communication program at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism; Bob Feldman, co-founder of the consulting firm PulsePoint Group and lastly, Jim Fleigner, managing partner at Impact Consultancy LLC.
The panel discussion was moderated by Dr. Robyn Walker, the associate professor at the Center for Management Communication.
Deetz began the talk by highlighting the lack of proper communication and empathy within companies — a problem that he explained could be easily solved through a change of perspective.
“I went into groups and organizations and they always have ‘problem people,’” Deetz said. “But I don’t think there are problem people. There are just a lot of really bad conversations. I do fun things in some organizations; like in small group discussions I pin little things on employees’ foreheads, which give them different kinds of personality characteristics. And I find that they rapidly reproduce those.”
Deetz then explained how our communication is affected by social constructions, which limit positive results in companies.  He discussed how the way we define meaning in our lives are derived from information sponsored by other people.
Deetz also argued that some of our current central issues are caused by a lack of proper communication, not a lack of knowledge.
“If we did a careful analysis of much of the debate around climate change, we would see that this is not a knowledge question at all,” Deetz said. “It really is a competing set of narratives about the ‘good life’ and how life works and the fear that one’s very life form is going to be given away.”
After Deetz finished his presentation, Feldman gave a different perspective on communication, one that took the reality of power structures within companies more into account. He revealed the importance of identifying company stakeholders — individuals who drive reputation, sales and business performance.
Fleigner added to this response, stating that market forces affected communication in the newspaper industry more than a change in individual perspective did. He explained that communication in the newspaper business has been dysfunctional for the last hundred years, but also included that things are changing for the better.
Fleigner mentioned that interdisciplinary communication is now more important than ever before, as industrial sectors are becoming more dependent due to the increase in technology use.
“Information is everything in terms of making good decisions in [the newspaper business]. So if you are in IT within a newspaper, people are coming to you [who] never used to speak with you before,” Fleigner said. “Information is everything in terms of making good decisions in [the newspaper business]. So if you are in IT within a newspaper, people are coming to you that never used to speak with you before.”

USC has signed a lease to expand its stake in downtown Los Angeles office buildings at the AT&T Center complex and to officially change the signage at the top of the tallest tower from “AT&T” to “USC.”
The 32-story AT&T Center building will be renamed the USC Building at AT&T Center  sometime during the fourth quarter, according to USC Associate Senior Vice President for Real Estate and Asset Management Laurie Stone.
The university already leases 215,000 square feet of space at the AT&T Center complex, located at 1149 S. Hill St. and 1150 Olive St., and will expand it’s lease to include 30,000 additional square feet of space.
“We have been a tenant in that building for a number of years, and this is an expansion of the lease that is currently existing,” said Stone. “We’re adding about 30,000 square feet to an existing presence in that building.”
The complex already houses the university radio station, Classical KUSC-FM, as well as portions of the Viterbi School of Engineering, the School of Social Work and the Marshall School of Business. The new square footage is only designated for the School of Social Work and Marshall, however.
“Having space Downtown is important for the university,” Stone said. “It solidifies our presence in Los Angeles and Downtown, so there’s a good reason for those departments and schools to be Downtown to have the connections.”
Stone said the space will be available for university operations sometime in May or June, following some routine renovations.

Erna Viterbi, wife of USC trustee Andrew Viterbi and joint namesake of the Viterbi School of Engineering, died in San Diego on Feb. 17 at the age of 81.
“For well over five decades, Erna was Andy’s beloved wife and trusted partner as they built an extraordinary life together,” said President C. L. Max Nikias in a statement released by USC News. “She earned the affection and admiration of everyone in the Trojan Family, and we take comfort in knowing that her remarkable life story will inspire generations of Trojans to come.”
Viterbi was born Erna Finci in 1934 to a Jewish family in Sarajevo in the former Yugoslavia, and her family fled to Montenegro during World War II as the German army advanced. The Finci family eventually found refuge in Parma, Italy, and later resided in Switzerland to wait out the war. They finally immigrated to California in 1950.
In 1956, she met her future husband, Andrew Viterbi, who was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena at the time.
In a 2007 interview at the USC engineering school, Andrew said, “Erna was destined to be my wife.” Two years after meeting, the couple married in 1958.
Throughout their marriage, Erna was at Andrew’s side as he navigated through the wireless revolution, eventually going on to co-found San Diego-based Qualcomm, a world leader in wireless telecommunications.
In 2004, the Viterbi’s donated the historic naming gift of $52 million to the USC engineering school, where Andrew had received his doctorate degree. The Viterbi School of Engineering debuted its new name on March 2, 2004.
The Viterbis’ continued generosity to the school and university over the next 10 years contributed to the creation of various scholarships, graduate student fellowships and endowed chairs.
Viterbi will be remembered for her leadership and generous contributions to philanthropies all over the world, including the USC Shoah Foundation.
Yannis Yortsos, dean of Viterbi School of Engineering, said Erna Viterbi will always be remembered at the school.
“[Erna] was a wonderful human being, with great heart, generous spirit, full of optimism, humility and grace,” Yortsos said in a memorandum to Viterbi colleagues. “Her legacy will live on for generations to come in the Viterbi school. And those future generations who will never have the chance to know her, will keep receiving the gifts of her magnanimity and humanity.”
She is survived by her husband; her son, Alan; her daughter, Audrey; and numerous grandchildren.
A memorial service was held at 2 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 19 in La Jolla, California, and USC will host a celebration of her life in May.

The USC Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council presented a check for more than $12,000 to the Dept. of Public Safety’s Explorer Program on Thursday night. The program allows at-risk youth ages 12 through 21 to explore careers in law enforcement and public service.
The donation, raised during the Greek Carnival put on by IFC and Panhellenic in the fall, will provide funds for participants in the Explorer Program to go to leadership camps in the summer and gain other skills through the program.
“We’re truly excited,” said Deputy Chief Johnnie Adams, who heads the Explorer Program. “[This donation] gives us the opportunity to grow our program because the more funds we have, the more we can do. We can do more outreach and have more kids join the program.”
Each fraternity and sorority chapter donated money to the carnival, and IFC and Panhellenic reached out to the Undergraduate Student Government and nearby businesses to sponsor the event. Last fall was the first time the Greek system held the carnival, and it has plans to continue the philanthropy.
“It was just a natural partnership pairing up with DPS and the Explorer Program because they do so much for us as a Greek community, whether it be education or keeping us safe on The Row,” Panhellenic President Caroline Cannan said. “We’re looking forward to the next few years and expanding the event and making it even more successful.”
DPS Chief John Thomas called the Greek system DPS’s most consistent supporter in his nine years working for the university. The groups have collaborated more in recent years, and now, IFC and Panhellenic have weekly meetings with Adams.
IFC President Jake Simon commented on the growing relationship between the members in the Greek system and DPS.
“Over the last year, the relationship between DPS, IFC and Panhellenic has been growing to an amazing degree,” Simon said. “We have a lot of dialogue, which helps us stay safer as a community.”
Ryan Lopez, a freshman majoring in chemistry, is serving his third year as a cadet with the program. He is also the post commander, tasked with overseeing the cadets and making sure that enough people are working at events.
“My experience with the cadet program has been an incredible one,” Lopez said. “Being a kid from the neighborhood, it’s given me a chance to explore something that I really didn’t think I’d like. It’s given me an opportunity to be exposed to more of a college atmosphere and develop relationships with the people on campus.”
Sergeant Rick Gonzalez was also part of a cadet program before he came to work at USC, where he has headed the program for the past 10 years. His favorite memory of the Explorer Program is when USC hired 15 out of 20 cadets from the local community after they went through training.
“When I was a cadet, what helped me was that I was able to interact with someone who was just like me from the neighborhood,” Gonzalez said. “Having somebody at that young age walk you through the process of becoming a law enforcement officer is really beneficial.”
Adams explained that Thomas has promoted community engagement throughout his time at USC and that DPS has a goal to reach out to the nearby community as a Trojan family. In the future, DPS hopes to have its cadets more engaged with the campus and serve more actively alongside DPS in promoting public safety.
“[The donation] is really great because it shows the kids that the community cares about them,” Gonzalez said. “Not only does our department care if they’re successful, but it’s the USC community that is also contributing.”

Though we had Valentine’s Day to celebrate last week, Lunar New Year takes the spotlight this week. Also known as Chinese New Year, the date of the holiday follows the cycle of the moon, and doesn’t match up any one day. Instead, the date of the Lunar New Year switches each year, taking place somewhere between late-January to mid-February. In Chinese families, the occasion is marked by reunions with close friends and family, a hearty dinner, and well wishes for the coming year ahead — perhaps all privileges for college students.
This year marks the Year of the Goat and whether you’re missing your family traditions back home or have never once considered celebrating the holiday, these are a few places you might consider checking out, for quick but worthwhile trip. As The Mountain Goats relevantly preach in their song “This Year,” we’re going to make it through — even if it kills us!
Golden Dragon Parade
Feb. 21 – 1 p.m. – Los Angeles Chinatown
Come see a traditional dragon dance in Chinatown! The event will be festive and lively, including marching bands and over two-dozen parade floats. Additionally, the parade aims to promote local Chinese businesses and Asian American culture, so if you’re looking for ways to get involved with local Asian community organizations, perhaps this is a place to start. The annual event will take place on Saturday, occupying Hill, Bernard, and Temple Streets, as well as Broadway.

Capital Seafood Restaurant
Landmark Shopping Center, 755 W Garvey Av.e, Monterey Park 
Ring in the Lunar New Year Cantonese-style. In contrast with many American holidays, when families will prepare home-cooked meals, it’s just as popular for Chinese families to visit their favorite restaurants on big holidays. On Chinese New Year, it’s custom to gather with lots of family and friends to head out to dinner and exchange lucky red envelopes. If you do this, make sure to wear something red or especially vibrant — you want to start out the New Year with some positive flair!
Capital Seafood is a good place to celebrate if you want to try some high quality Chinese dishes, that are popular in Hong Kong. The menu includes the traditional selection, of soup, seafood, rice and noodle dishes, as well as Chinese desserts — so don’t come here if you’re craving oil and takeout. Chinese dinner food in contrast is very simple and light on seasoning. Much of the flavor you get will come from fish cooked in soy sauce, or the meat that is in your fried rice. The fried rice with crab eggs and sausage is a personal favorite. If you’ve finished your meal and are still craving a sweet kick, the bubble tea spot, Half and Half, is just steps away.

Half and Half Tea House
Landmark Shopping Center, 755 W Garvey Ave, Monterey Park
I’ve had a lot of bubble tea in my day, but I’ve never seen a tea menu as extensive as Half and Half’s. There are milk and fruit tea flavors that are hardly conceivable and can be paired with any topping from popular tapioca to more daring pudding. The pages-long menu also includes Half and Half’s signature Iced Milk Drink, a sweet, milky drink that actually contains no tea. It is definitely worth a try if you like drinks with a kick of honey. At Half and Half, all drinks are served in a stout-looking bucket cup, a reminder of what you might look like if you start giving into boba addiction. The upside? Realizing that it might just be worth it.

AU79
1635 S. San Gabriel Blvd. San Gabriel, CA 91776
Another tea house not too far from Monterrey Park is AU79. With locations in San Gabriel and Pasadena, the cute spot is known for its milk teas and light snacks. There are sesame noodles and an assortment of yummy fried snacks too. If you like Chinese food and boba and are looking for a sit-down place to enjoy both, go check out AU79 this Chinese New Year. Their tapioca is really well made, so that’s an obvious plus.

The USC women’s basketball team is in the home stretch of its regular season run, with only two home games left. After a tough loss to the Stanford Cardinal (20-7, 12-3 Pac-12), the Women of Troy overcame the California Golden Bears (20-7, 11-4 Pac-12) by a score of 65-54.
The game belonged to seniors Kaneisha Horn and Alexyz Vaioletama, who scored 17 points apiece. Head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke called the game “the tale of two halves.” Vaioletama experienced foul trouble early against the Bears, while Horn had reliable offense in the first. In the second half, Vaioletama would have a surge in offensive success.
“No matter what Cal threw at us, we didn’t get down on ourselves,” said Cooper-Dyke. “We executed both in the half court set offensively and in the half court defensively.”
Sophomore guard Alexis Lloyd performed well offensively, scoring 14 points against the Bears.
“We just went out there with nothing to lose,” said Lloyd. “We helped one another, we picked one another up. We were just having fun out there.”
Now the Women of Troy are back at home, preparing to face the Arizona Wildcats (9-16, 2-12        Pac-12) on Friday at 7 p.m. On Sunday, USC will crusade against the Arizona State Sun Devils (22-4, 11-3 Pac-12).
The Sunday game against Arizona State will be Senior Day, and USC will honor Horn and Vaioletama for their hard work fighting for Troy.
“I’m just happy that my whole family will be here to support not only just myself, but the whole team,” Vaioletama said.
Horn has been consistent on both ends of the court, averaging 10.3 points and 7.1 rebounds per game. Vaioletama has made great strides this season, shooting 49 percent from the field. She also leads the team in blocks, with 15 so far this season. Cooper-Dyke said the duo’s talents would be missed, but she knows they will have prosperous futures.
“They are two very talented players. I fully expect them to go pro,” Cooper-Dyke said. “They’re very athletic. They can stretch the defense with their outside shot.”
The Sun Devils reside in the higher echelon of the Pac-12, sitting in third place. The previous weekend, Arizona State condemned the Oregon Ducks (12-13, 5-9          Pac-12) to defeat. However, the Oregon State Beavers (23-2, 13-1 Pac-12) overwhelmed the Sun Devils.
The Sun Devils are led by Katie Hempen, who scores 12 points per game and has a 37 percent shooting average from behind the arc. Sophie Brunner has led the team in either points, rebounds or both for the past six games. She has earned 11.9 points and 7.5 rebounds per game for the Sun Devils.
The Friday night game against Arizona is also a “pink” game in honor of the Play4Kay campaign. Former North Carolina State University women’s basketball coach Kay Yow created the fund to raise money for cancer treatment research. Yow lost her third fight with breast cancer in 2009.
Arizona’s Candice Warthen averages 12.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. LaBrittney Jones earns 9.4 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. The Wildcats were USC’s first victim in its road to the championship in the Pac-12 tournament last year.
“We play at a very high level, and we’re gonna bring that to Arizona,” said Cooper-Dyke. “Every team in the Pac-12 conference is very competitive.”

USC is home to some of the greatest sport teams in the country. With over 120 national championships in sports ranging from football to water polo, you could say USC is the school to attend for student athletes.
However, even with all the national championships, Olympians and Heisman Trophy winners, something feels missing.
Soccer is the world’s largest, most watched and most played sport. To put things into perspective, 115 million people watched the Super Bowl this year, setting a U.S. record for the most viewed television program in history. The day before the Super Bowl, however, Premier League leaders Chelsea and Manchester City played, drawing over 500 million viewers worldwide, or almost five times as many viewers as America’s biggest sporting spectacle.
Despite soccer’s massive international appeal and rising domestic popularity following the past few World Cups, USC does not field a Division I men’s soccer team. However, there are numerous reasons why USC should be pushing to add a team.
To start off, I’m still amazed that USC has teams in much smaller sports like water polo and swimming. These are great sports, but they draw nowhere near the popularity that soccer does. The skeptic will be quick to point out that USC does have a women’s soccer team and is limited by restrictions from Title IX.
Yes, the Trojans do field a women’s team, a pretty good one too, as it won the NCAA tournament back in 2007. But USC’s constant claims that it cannot field a team because of Title IX is rubbish.
Title IX requires that universities have equal funding for both men’s and women’s collegiate teams, which has contributed to the rise of women’s sports in the United States. While many smaller schools are hampered by Title IX regulations, leading to some sports teams being cut, larger schools such as UCLA, Stanford and Virginia, to name a few, all manage to have both men’s and women’s soccer teams.
This past year, UCLA and Virginia played in the NCAA men’s soccer national championship game, with the Cavaliers taking the trophy home (thank God). Both of these schools also field highly competitive football and basketball programs, yet still manage to have a men’s soccer team. Other top schools like North Carolina, Louisville and California also manage to field teams in football, basketball and soccer.
It is incomprehensible that a university with more than $4 billion endowment cannot find the money to fund a Division I men’s soccer program.
As a former member of the USC men’s club soccer team here on campus, I can speak firsthand in saying that the interest and talent is present for the administration to start a Division I squad. Every semester, the club team draws over 100 players vying for a spot on a    30-man roster.
Most of the players that play for the club team have the talent to easily play for competitive Division I or Division II teams. However, by choosing to attend USC, the players are stuck in a much lower level of play.
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, home to the USC football team, recently sold out an annual tournament featuring teams from Mexico’s premier soccer division. The Coliseum is also set to host the Mexican national team versus Ecuador this coming March.
Soccer is growing rapidly in popularity, especially in Los Angeles, following the United States’ successes in recent World Cups. USC is situated in one of the largest youth soccer hotbeds in the country. Numerous players from the L.A. area, like Landon Donovan, have gone on to play professionally.
On top of international success, Los Angeles’ professional team, the Galaxy, has won the MLS championship three out of the last four years, while selling out almost every home game. On top of that, the Galaxy recently signed English star Steven Gerrard to a contract for next season, driving home the fact that U.S. soccer is becoming a global brand.
How can a university which enrolls almost more foreign students than any other school fail to recognize the importance of soccer?
USC often boasts about being one of the most diverse universities in the United States, enrolling more than 9,000 foreign students during the 2012-2013 year. Most of these students come from countries where soccer is viewed as a religion, leaving them shocked by the fact that the Trojans do not have a team.
Upset by the fact that the university has yet to add a Division I program, some disgruntled students have taken action into their own hands. There is currently a petition on the popular website change.org with close to 800 signatures, almost 5 percent of the undergraduate student body.
The university recently announced that it will be adding another men’s sport in the coming future, after women’s lacrosse was added three years ago. Along with wrestling and lacrosse, soccer is one of the sports up for consideration. For now, students will have to be content with intramural and club soccer.
There will always be obstacles, and I’m not saying it will be easy, but adding a men’s soccer team to USC is a must. The ball is in your box, USC. Give the students what they deserve and bring the beautiful game to Los Angeles.

There are many mens sports that are not present at USC, because of the Universities push towards adding more female sports teams. Unfortunately, girls teams don’t bring in revenue to the sports programs other than perhaps, basketball. Title IX is the demise of mens sports at most schools as it is here at USC. USC AD Pat Haden is a huge proponent of women’s sports, so don’t hold your breath to see a mens soccer team, unless it’s a non-schollie sponsored club team.

Seven USC football players will participate in the NFL Combine from Friday, Feb. 20 to Monday, Feb. 23. The players will take part in interviews and be further evaluated by being put through a variety of drills, specific to their position. Types of these drills include the 40-yard dash, bench press and vertical jump.
Players who have been invited to partipate in the combine hope to increase their draft stock and in turn, thei chances of playing professional football in the NFL.
Defensive end Leonard Williams, wide receiver Nelson Agholor, linebackers Hayes Pullard and J.R. Tavai, running back Javorius “Buck” Allen, cornerback Josh Shaw and tight end Randall Telfer will represent the Trojans. The seven USC players tie Oregon for most in the Pac-12.
On-field workouts will be split up by position over the four days. Specialists, offensive linemen and tight ends will work out on Friday; quarterbacks, wide receivers and running backs on Saturday; defensive linemen and linebackers take the field on Sunday; and defensive backs work out Monday.
Williams is the most highly touted prospect of the group, sitting at No. 1 on Mel Kiper’s Big Board. He entered the 2014-2015 season as one of the likely candidates to go No. 1 and has decisions off the field, despite being a promising prospect in the secondary.
Shaw recorded only 12 tackles in the three games he played, but he had 119 tackles and six interceptions in his collegiate career with USC and Florida.
Pullard and Tavai are both coming off strong seasons and look to improve their draft stock. Pullard led the Trojans with 95 tackles last season, 5.5 of them for loss. Tavai fiwnished with 53 total tackles, 13.5 for loss, and his seven sacks tied Williams for most on the team. Both are projected as mid-round picks.
Telfer finished with 21 receptions for 197 yards and two touchdowns. He’s projected to be drafted in the last couple rounds.
Updated results and recaps will be available on the USC RipsIt Twitter feed and blog.

The 87th Academy Awards are only three days away, and the suspense is beginning to build into a battle of “wills.” Will Richard Linklater’s tender coming-of-age story Boyhood win the night as many analysts are predicting, or will Alejandro González Iñárritu’s surreal showbiz satire Birdman fly off with the top prize clutched in its talons? Will the other nominees in J.K. Simmons and Julianne Moore’s respective categories even bother to show up? Will anyone tease Best Actor frontrunner Eddie Redmayne about all the guy-liner and sinister whispering in Jupiter Ascending? Finally, there’s the most important “will” of all: Will those of us who aren’t hopeless awards season junkies care enough to tune in?
2014 was a wonderful year at the movies if you knew where to look, but with the notable exception of Clint Eastwood’s jingoistic crowd-pleaser American Sniper ($307 million at the box office and counting), none of the current Best Picture nominees were engineered to be mass-appeal hits. They’re art-house efforts for the most part, ranging from the blood-on-the-skins grit of Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash to the Merchant Ivory-style polish of Morten Tyldum’s The Imitation Game and James Marsh’s The Theory of Everything. The only other nominee to crack $100 million was Wes Anderson’s delightful confectionary caper The Grand Budapest Hotel, mainly due to its conspicuously early release date — a March opening is rare for a would-be Oscar contender — and repeat viewings from the idiosyncratic director’s sizable built-in fanbase.
So, who’s actually going home with the little gold guy? The Best Picture race is a tough call this year.  American Sniper and Selma are both too politically polarizing to have a real shot at winning, and The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything are little more than glorified acting showcases, even though the performances they’re showcasing are admittedly phenomenal. Whiplash and The Grand Budapest Hotel were my first and second favorite movies of 2014, respectively, and I’d dearly love to see one of them score a come-from-behind victory. In the end, though, it will likely come down to either Boyhood or Birdman.
Boyhood deserves to be celebrated for the sheer scope of Linklater’s creative ambition — it was filmed over 12 years, thus allowing the actors to literally grow up with their characters — but the nearly three-hour film suffers from a soppy, meandering third act and an alarmingly passive protagonist who winds up resembling the whiny, directionless cynic we all took pains to avoid in high school.
Birdman, on the other hand, is a dark and daring technical marvel — film majors will be drooling over that single-take illusion for years — elevated by a fearless, career-topping performance from the great Michael Keaton. Iñárritu, a director whose previous work was hobbled by thematic pretension, has finally discovered his own wicked sense of humor, and attention must be paid. If Boyhood wins Best Picture, it’s a good bet the Mexican filmmaker will be given Best Director as a hefty consolation prize.
What about the other major races? The Best Actor category is definitely Redmayne’s to lose at this point. His transformative portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything should be judged separately from the film itself, an aggressively mediocre mélange of historical fact, cheap sensationalism and gauzy romantic gobbledygook. Redmayne’s stiffest competition is sure to come from Keaton, the comeback kid inhabiting the role of a lifetime, and The Imitation Game’s Benedict Cumberbatch, who previously appeared as Hawking in a BBC movie back in 2004. While it’s true Cumberbatch could embody tortured genius in his sleep at this point, the actor actually manages the difficult feat of turning the coldblooded code breaker Alan Turing into a tragic, achingly human figure whose facets and foibles are distinctly separate from the shadow of Sherlock.
J.K. Simmons should be considered the lock of the night to win Best Supporting Actor for his towering, fire-breathing performance in Whiplash. As Fletcher, the tyrannical music teacher who gleefully pushes his students past their mental and physical breaking points in order to satisfy his own ruthless pursuit of perfection, the longtime character actor has finally stepped into the spotlight, and the result is both hilarious and utterly terrifying. Julianne Moore, another gifted performer whose Oscar seems long overdue, appears poised to win her first Best Actress statuette as a linguistics professor battling early-onset Alzheimer’s in the devastating drama Still Alice.
The outcome of the Best Supporting Actress race is slightly less certain. Emma Stone and Keira Knightley both turned in top-notch work in male-dominated stories, but their awards circuit track record doesn’t bode particularly well for either of them. Laura Dern’s flashback scenes prevented Wild from being too much of a slog, but sadly this just isn’t her year either. Meryl Streep was undoubtedly the highlight of Disney’s watered-down Into the Woods adaptation, but her nomination really should have been given to Tilda Swinton for the latter’s turn as a simpering, bespectacled bureaucrat in Bong Joon-ho’s certifiably insane sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer. Without Swinton around to make things interesting, the award will likely go to Patricia Arquette for Boyhood, a solid but dispiritingly safe choice.
Oh well, “solid but dispiritingly safe” is often the order of the day when it comes to Hollywood’s awards season. That doesn’t mean Sunday’s broadcast won’t contain a few welcome surprises, however. Neil Patrick Harris is hosting this year. Maybe he and Rosamund Pike can recreate the bedroom scene in Gone Girl as an interpretive dance number or something. Let’s see Amy and Tina beat that craziness.

The cream of the Oscar-nominated short film crop this year is the live action category, and by a good margin. This year’s group is a collection of five excellent films from around the world. The United States got squeezed out of this group in favor of two films from the U.K., one from Switzerland, one from Israel and one from China. This wonderful group of films collectively leaves behind the whimsy of the animated category and the gloom of the documentaries for a more diverse selection of moods.
Boogaloo and Graham, from the U.K., is one of the best of the nominated five. The film focuses on two Northern Irish brothers and their relationship with a couple of chickens that their father gifted them. The kids are inseparable from the chickens, walking around Belfast with the chickens on their shoulders. All is rosy until their mother grows increasingly frustrated with the chickens and eventually tells the children to get rid of them. Beautifully directed by Michael Lennox, the story does not hit on any big issues or try to make any overarching claims. But this story of a family and a pair of chickens is, simply put, adorable. The brothers are a delight, and their father’s love for them is so well depicted that it’s sure to put a few lumps in some unsuspecting throats.
Next is Parvaneh, another lovely film. In it, a young Afghani refugee in the Swiss Alps, the eponymous Parvaneh, goes to Zurich in an attempt to send some money back to Afghanistan to help her sick father. She is lost in the busy city and has trouble adjusting to some of the cultural differences she comes across. But after a while, Parvaneh makes a friend who takes her on an adventure through Zurich. Like Boogaloo, the story is only a small vignette, but it is charming. Nissa Kashani is relentlessly appealing as the lead, and over the course of the night the meek Parvaneh unveils a newfound toughness. Kashani does a great job depicting this gradual change over the 25-minute runtime. The film is quite good, but in this highly competitive field, it will probably fall short.
Another that will likely fall short is the most difficult to decipher of the five — Butter Lamp, a Chinese film with no narrative. The entire film consists of a traveling photographer taking pictures of villagers in a small Tibetan village in front of a series of backdrops. There is no narration and almost no dialogue. As a viewer, it takes a while to realize that the entire film will indeed consist only of the photos being taken, instead of moving to a different location or anything else happening. On the surface, it is simply as follows: a Tibetan family sets itself up in front of a backdrop, a photographer gives it instructions, a picture is taken, the Tibetan family leaves, the backdrop is changed, rinse and repeat. However, the little quirks of the families interacting with the photographer, the backdrops and each other give the film a compelling charm. It obviously wouldn’t work as a feature-length movie, but 15 minutes is not long enough for the charm to wear off. Unfortunately, the category is very strong, and despite its latent charm, Butter Lamp can’t really measure up to its competitors.
One of the strongest of this stacked field is The Phone Call. Like Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1 in the Documentary Short Subject category, the story takes place in a crisis hotline office. And like in Crisis Hotline, director Mat Kirkby manages to extract a boatload of emotion and suspense from a standard office that at face value does not scream “emotional roller coaster.” The majority of the action focuses on Heather (Sally Hawkins), and as she is on the phone, most of the film is cut close to her face. The voice on the other end of the line is a sad Stan (Jim Broadbent) at the end of his rope, though we never see him. Over the course of 20 minutes, Hawkins’ character connects with Broadbent’s, as Heather pleads with Stan to let her call him an ambulance. They develop a strong connection over their short conversation, and Hawkins sells it with some incredibly nuanced facial acting.
Now, in a strong field like this, it takes an exceptional film to rise to the top. Israel’s Aya manages to do just that. In the film, the titular Aya ends up picking up a stranger at the airport when she is mistaken for his assigned driver. Aya decides to not correct the mistake and drive the man anyway. Over the course of their drive together, the two develop a strange dynamic, first while he carries on believing that she is the driver, and then when she reveals the mix-up to him halfway to his hotel. Sarah Adler is enchanting as the enigmatic Aya. Her character is an open book who expresses her feelings to a complete stranger, but there is an unplaceable aloofness to her that makes the character fascinating. The passenger, a Danish music researcher named Mr. Overby (Ulrich Thomsen), plays off of her extremely well. He is very reserved at first, and then outraged at the deception. But in the end, Mr. Overby cannot help but be intrigued by her je ne sais quoi. Directors Oded Binnun and Mihal Brezis complement the performances expertly, and the result is a lovely film that should win in this all-around impressive field.

By Brian Williams’ own account, he has had a dream journalism career. Not only has he successfully reported on exciting stories, he’s lived them. He saved two puppies from a burning home as a teenage volunteer firefighter. He witnessed a dead body float by during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. And in Iraq, he rode in a helicopter that was shot at by a rocket-propelled grenade.
The key words here are “from Brian Williams’ own account.” It’s an account that, as a professional and esteemed reporter, should be exceptionally trustworthy. Instead, it was recently discovered that Williams blatantly exaggerated his experiences in Iraq, leading to his without-pay suspension from NBC Nightly News. His helicopter didn’t come under fire; the chopper over an hour ahead of him did. Since this discovery, fellow journalists have dedicated themselves to investigating Williams’ entire career, revealing other embellishments he made about his experiences over the years.
Instead of solely focusing on Williams, however, journalists need to apply the same vigor to reviewing their own careers. Williams’ slip shouldn’t be considered a single scandal for the media to obsess over; it should prompt members of the media to revisit traditional journalism ethics. Sure, Williams’ transgressions were major and obvious, but many journalists stretch the truth. Nonetheless, the public outcry over Williams’ lies proves that audiences expect journalists to be trustworthy.
Admittedly, storytelling is an important aspect of journalism, but these stories need to be true. This is nothing new: the central tenet of journalism has always been reliability, even if this is occasionally forgotten. The Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics requires reporters to “seek truth and report it,” “minimize harm,” “act independently” and “be accountable.” By falsifying events, Williams violates this code.
According to the Code of Ethics, deliberately distorting information is unacceptable. This rule is echoed in NBC’s contract with Williams, which reportedly included a “morality clause.” The clause allows the network to fire Williams for offending the general public, or offending himself.
Some claim that according to this clause, NBC should immediately fire Williams for his lies. In actuality, there’s a bit of a gray area; many of the exaggerations occurred outside of Williams’ NBC broadcasts. Williams didn’t exaggerate directly from the position of a reporter — he exaggerated during public appearances. The stories came from Williams the celebrity, not from Williams the journalist.
This blurred line is occurring more and more within the industry, and journalists must be careful to hold themselves to ethical standards, regardless of the situation. Traditionally, journalists were the “behind the scenes” people. They weren’t part of the news –— they simply observed events and reported them truthfully. Like Williams, many of today’s prominent journalists have reached celebrity status. They are interviewed on the shows of their colleagues and garner thousands of Twitter followers. This gives journalists a more personal platform than the media outlet they work for.
Though it is easy to slip into storytelling mode on these personal platforms, journalists must tell the truth when relaying even personal stories. The Code of Ethics clearly states that one of the main tenets of being accountable is “abiding by the same high standards to which [journalists] hold others.” If journalists criticize Williams for stretching the truth, they must judge their own work accordingly. Williams may be an extreme example, but he’s an example nonetheless.
As for Williams’ punishment, does it really matter? If he is permanently terminated from NBC, he’ll be a cautionary tale for other journalists. Even if he is allowed to return, the surrounding scandal will keep journalism ethics relevant. As tempting as it is for journalists to adopt a celebrity persona, the backlash against Williams proves that the public doesn’t want more celebrity personas; it wants want reporters that it can trust. Hopefully, this will motivate other journalists to avoid a scandal of their own by committing to traditional, honest reporting.

When Otto von Bismarck compared the process of making laws to making sausage — saying in both cases it is better not to observe the process — he likely never imagined that sausage factories like Congress would keep accidentally shutting themselves down. And yet, come Feb. 27, the Department of Homeland Security is scheduled to run out of money amid the latest congressional soap opera.
The dispute concerns President Barack Obama’s executive actions, taken last year, to protect some illegal immigrants who already reside in the country from deportation. Republicans in Congress believe that the actions are unconstitutional, and, in the wake of a Texas federal court ruling that temporarily halted the actions, wish to defund them. Republicans quickly passed a bill in the House that both funds the DHS and prohibits that money from implementing Obama’s anti-deportation scheme. Though in the minority, Senate Democrats have filibustered the bill, preventing it from reaching Obama’s desk for what would be a certain veto. If an agreement can’t be reached, there will be no funding bill for the DHS by the Feb. 27 deadline.
This latest of the hostage-taking, funding-style drama is petty and based on an illogical interpretation of Congress’s power of the purse. Before showing why, two facts are worth highlighting that have, as usual, been lost in the media confusion.
First, the Department of Homeland Security will not actually shut down if the funding deadline passes. Instead, workers deemed “non-essential” to DHS functioning would be furloughed (given time off without pay) until the funding resumes. Security services like the TSA would still be fully functional.
Second, the federal judge in Texas who issued the injunction merely halted implementation of Obama’s actions until the lawsuit runs its course. The government will likely appeal, and there is good evidence to suggest that the circuit court will, rather quickly, uphold the president’s deportation protection as constitutional due to this great irony: Obama’s policy of deciding which illegal immigrants to deport and which to protect has not happened in a vacuum, but is actually an outgrowth of — you guessed it — Congress’ power to appropriate.
This is because Congress never appropriates enough funds each year to deport every illegal immigrant in America. In fact, it only designates enough money to deport roughly 400,000 of the 11 million illegal immigrants annually, according to Slate. Obama’s decision not to deport certain individuals continues a tradition followed by presidents for years, and it doesn’t even factor in that Obama has overseen one of the largest deportation regimes in American history, prompting The Economist to refer to his immigration policy as “America’s deportation machine.”
If the DHS won’t shut down, and the federal judge didn’t actually validate Republican lawmakers’ claims that Obama’s action is unconstitutional, and Obama’s action really is constitutional, then why the fuss?
There shouldn’t be any. Congress’ ability to restrict funding for certain executive actions is one thing, but conflating the power of the purse with the power to hold funding for anything hostage in exchange for restricting executive orders is a terrible interpretation of that particular aspect of the Constitution. But that’s what the GOP have embarrassingly done.
In United States v. MacCollom (1976), the Supreme Court said, “The expenditure of public funds is proper only when authorized by Congress, not that public funds may be expended unless prohibited by Congress.”
If the GOP is serious about subverting Obama’s deportation easing, it should send him a bill pursuant to the MacCollom decision that appropriates enough funds to actually deport people. As it stands, Obama couldn’t deport the 5 million people his plan protects even if he wanted to. To resolve the current situation, the DHS funding bill should stripped off the anti-Obama clause. Short of that, Congress could also pass a clean (but short-term) stopgap measure that funds the DHS until the courts either validate or strike down Obama’s executive action, something that sensible conservatives like John McCain have called for in recent days.
Sadly, the media on the left doesn’t care about solutions, either — they care about scoring as many political points on the GOP as possible. In a spectacular example of polling chicanery, CNN asked voters who would get the most blame if the DHS shut down. From the list of choices, 53 percent of Americans said they would hold the GOP in Congress responsible, 30 percent said they would fault Obama and 13 percent said both. This seems convincing — until you consider that CNN didn’t even list “Democrats in Congress” as an option, a really depressing realization.
Be it laws or polls, sometimes it’s a more blissful existence when you don’t know what goes into the sausage.

The DHS did not exist until shortly before the current president took office. Giving them a few days off will not jeopardize the safety of a nation of 300 million people and their over 200 million guns. Additionally, the DHS is a small fraction of the “defense” of the nation.
With all due respect, it is the Democrats that are feeling this fire and not passing a House sponsored, bi-partisan DHS funding bill, not the GOP.
This president has overstepped his powers and authority with his Executive Orders and Memos, so it is time for America to step up and try to correct these illegal legislative moves by the president. Just think… if the next president were a Republican, how what would you ask of you Congressional representatives and senators if the president decided I n his own to tax your Internet access, to penalize you via an IRS audit for disagreeing with him, was caught directing the NSA to execute some nefarious deed that is unconstitutional?  Oh wait, that’s what Obama is doing.
It’s time, Nathan, to begin the cleanup of the mess that this president has been allowed to do via the Harry Reid led senate the past 4 years. This is just the beginning of a congressional effort to clean up the mess. It’s going to take a long time to do it, but you and your children’s freedoms, the ones my dad and his dad fought for are at stake.
Yes, times… they are a changin, but here, today, it’s in a nefarious way… not a good thing.

As far as Valentine’s Day is concerned in the United States, I consider it to be the day mostly manufactured by Hallmark and Hershey’s, the day when I can expect to see at least one embarrassed girl carrying around a teddy bear bigger than herself.
Surprisingly enough, Valentine’s Day is also a hit in Japan, though how the Japanese celebrate it differs slightly from how Americans celebrate it. Or maybe I shouldn’t be so surprised, considering that it isn’t uncommon for Japanese to celebrate Christmas with KFC.
One difference between how Japanese celebrate Valentine’s Day and how Americans celebrate it is that in Japan, following convention means that only women give Valentine’s gifts. There’s a separate day referred to as “White Day” in March, when roles are reversed and men give gifts to women.
This Valentine’s Day, just a few days ago, a friend and I decided to make small packages with short Valentine notes and green tea KitKats and hand them out to the other students in our program. While the purpose of the valentines weren’t to express any romantic feelings, we figured they would be a convenient way to convey our appreciation for the moments we had all enjoyed together since meeting each other for the first time, less than two weeks ago.
The notes contained cheesy puns, so my friend and I ended up having to explain what phrases like “you’re the cat’s meow” meant to the Japanese students who received them. From “you’re the cat’s meow” to Mean Girls references to “hella dank,” one of my favorite aspects of spending time with the Keio University students has been sharing American slang with them.
It has resulted in laughs for Japanese students and international students alike, proving that cultural exchange doesn’t necessarily have to be stiff and formal.

Hi! My name is Emily, and I’m directionally challenged. I’m the girl whose eyes are constantly glued to my phone turning in circles trying to orient Google Maps. As a passenger in the car I’ll arrive at a destination with no idea how to return back to my starting point if I was asked to take the wheel. Struggling to navigate my way through American cities like New York or Los Angeles, I was slightly concerned about getting around in a foreign city where I don’t even speak the language fluently.
Before I left for Madrid, I asked my mom, who had studied abroad in London as junior in college, how she could possibly navigate through Europe without an iPhone. Apparently, a sense of direction and paper maps were all she needed. It completely boggled my mind how she not only found her way through London, but also traversed through Europe on a backpacking trip without Google Maps planning her every move.
Yet, four weeks into my semester abroad and most of my navigational qualms have been suppressed. I know each different neighborhood in the center of Madrid and the best route to each from my apartment. I know how to get to school and back taking the Metro or walking. Much to my surprise, finding my way across the city through Madrid’s public transit system has been a piece of cake.
While I still have to turn in circles sometimes when I walk out of the Metro station slightly disoriented, it’s never long before I’m off to my destination. Even if I will always remain a little directionally challenged, Madrid is teaching me to become more comfortable with getting lost. I can meander the city freely knowing that I will always find my way home (with a little help from Google Maps here and there of course), or hop in a Metro station if my legs get tired and figure out my best route home.
There was something about getting lost that used to scare me. After a month in Madrid I’ve learned (through trial and error) that getting “lost” is nothing to be afraid of. It’s even kind of fun. If I didn’t let myself get lost every now and then I wouldn’t have found half of my favorite restaurants and stores.
In fact, getting lost has been the best way for me to learn the city.

The Valentine’s weekend release of Fifty Shades of Grey was marketing genius. Not only did the film ride off the commercial success of the novel, but it also took advantage of the Valentine’s Day hype. Reeling in $93 million in less than a week, Fifty Shades grossed the highest amount of money for any film directed by a female.
But does that put her down in the history books as the most successful female director?
Not if you’ve ever watched any quality movies before.
I don’t disapprove of the bondage and unabashed sexual appetites in Fifty Shades, simply because those are natural human instincts — nothing to be ashamed of. What bothers me is that Fifty Shades is not a lasting work of film.
In 20 years, we won’t be analyzing the carefully composed shot of Christian Grey showing his pube hairs, nor will we be exploring the subtext of Christian’s and Anastasia’s dirty sex-talk. Fifty Shades earns money because it broaches a fairly taboo topic — deviant sexual practices.
And that’ll definitely lead to an…interesting path for mainstream media. Fifty Shades is considered a romance, but it’s really much more about sexual attraction than it is about real love (not that those two are completely different entities, but that’s a whole other argument).
What I’m trying to say is that Fifty Shades will tell you a lot about things you can do in the bedroom, but it won’t give you any insight on real-life, under-the-broad-daylight relationships. If you want some sexual fantasy in your life, I recommend a dose of Fifty Shades. But if you want to connect with real people about real issues, I recommend the classic When Harry Met Sally.

Anyone who eats often enough at any one of USC’s residential dining halls knows that the food runs on a cyclic schedule. Fridays are usually the best nights at Parkside with salmon being a regular, and breakfast rotates the occasional pancakes or breakfast burritos, in addition to the main affair of eggs, bacon and waffles. The food isn’t bad by any means, at least by my standards, but the lack of variety can be tiresome. 
The idealist in me hopes for a constant change-up in dishes served at our residential dining halls. If you think about it, chefs have some of the most creative jobs — recipes don’t just appear out of nowhere. They are invented by chefs who have been struck by inspiration, their hearts guiding them to create very dish they’ve envisioned. USC could draw on chefs’ past experiences and give them greater individual freedom. What do they love to cook? Each chef could take creative control of the bar or even the entire dining hall for one day of the week and serve what he or she is passionate about. If a chef told me that he or she was inspired to cook something that their families love to eat, I’d be all the more willing to come down and support them.
From the kitchen’s standpoint, having a rotating schedule makes sense. Feeding hundreds of hungry college kids each day is no small feat. Think of the volumes of food (and the cost) involved! As difficult as it is, it’d be nice if just once in a while, students had a little more to look forward to in their residential dining halls. Whether or not the dining halls ever expand their food horizons, I give our chefs exceptional credit for being the hard workers that they are. It’s a tough job.

Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel spoke about the history and future of Snapchat and the nature of entrepreneurship at the event, “Fireside Chat with Evan Spiegel,” on Wednesday evening in Taper Hall.
The event was planned by Ashish Soni, executive director of digital innovation at the Viterbi School of Engineering and founding director of the Viterbi Student Institute for Innovation.
Snapchat, an app that allows users to share photos and videos with select recipients for durations between one and 10 seconds, is possibly looking forward to opportunities in the mobile system through music, according to Spiegel.
“Music is really appealing to us right now because it has some of the same attributes that communication had when we were working on Snapchat in the beginning,” Spiegel said. “Right now on your mobile phone, music is largely non-differentiated, so you usually search for a song and you can play it. It plays from four of five different places, they roughly cost the same, but it’s also high frequency. After communication, [music is] the highest frequency behavior on your phone and so that in our view, makes it a really interesting opportunity and it’s something that we are thinking about.”
Snapchat’s newest addition, Discover, allows users to view short articles and videos from various media outlets, such as CNN, Yahoo! and Vice.
“The first [problem with feed based media is that] the fastest story wins and that means a lot of times, you make mistakes because you’re in such a hurry to get things on the internet,” Spiegel said. “We also found that headlines were driving distribution to different websites in the feed to try and attract people to click on them.”
Spiegel said the new Snapchat feature alleviates the issue of branding issues that Twitter has created. The purpose of creating Discover was to drive viewers away from simply scrolling through their Twitter without recognizing what information they were looking at.
“We also saw that brands were kind of losing their value because on Twitter, the brand wasn’t really so important and people weren’t paying attention to where they were reading their news,” Spiegel said. “So we tried to build something that tried to bring back the editorial perspective, because we believe it’s really valuable to have someone who’s smarter than us figure out what’s important, because that’s a full time job and a really hard one.”
Spiegel explained that part of Snapchat’s current success comes from users not wanting to manage online profiles.
“Social media in its first kind of incarnation was really about identity,” Spiegel said. “It’s about building the virtual Evan. ‘Here’s the things Evan likes, here’s all his friends, here’s pictures of Evan,’ and that just gets really boring at some points.”
Spiegel further commented on the issue of building an online profile. He explained that online sites that require individual profiles are inaccurate depictions of people, as we continuously change.
“Part of what makes it so tedious is that people change — they grow actually really, really quickly — so you end up with this kind of huge accumulation of things that don’t really reflect who you are at all,” Spiegel said. “Worrying about that and managing this huge identity of you on the Internet just wasn’t really fun and it was also much more fun to talk with pictures.”
According to Spiegel, the app is simple because it is solely based on snaps. Spiegel described snaps as small windows into another user’s perspective.
“[Snapchat] is really focused on feeling and that means that we care a lot about the essence of conversation,” Spiegel said. “I think what it really enabled people to do is focus on ‘what is this person trying to say to me with this picture,’ not ‘what are they trying to save’ and so by shifting the attention to ‘what is … someone trying to communicate to me,’ we focus on the feeling and not the appearance of image.”
Spiegel also discussed the nature of entrepreneurship and explained that building a strong team of workers is one of the most important parts in creating a great startup. He commented that effective startups have leaders who are able to say no to outsiders and to stay focused.
He stressed the importance of being fully aware of legality when agreeing to build a startup.
“If you hear the words ‘standard terms’ then figure out actually what the terms are, because they are probably not standard and the person explaining [them] to you probably doesn’t know how they work,” Spiegel said.
Soni said that one of the most important things Spiegel emphasized was the importance of team choice.
“Building a company is a long, hard journey and you need good people by your side to go with the ups and the downs and the fact that the team matters is huge,” Soni said.

The USC women’s sand volleyball team was voted the No. 2 team in the nation in the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) preseason poll, which was released on Feb. 16. The only team to receive more votes than USC was Pepperdine, the defending national champion.
The Women of Troy had the No. 1 ranking last season on their way to a third-place finish in the AVCA national championship semifinals. USC reached the national semifinals each of the past two seasons, and members of the team have also won the pairs’ championship. Kirby Burnham and Stevi Robinson, who have graduated, won the pairs’ title in 2013, followed by Burnham and current sophomore Sara Hughes in 2014.
To complement their pairs championship, Burnham and Hughes also represented the Women of Troy as AVCA All-Americans.
USC garnered another accolade as well last season. Head coach Anna Collier, a USC athletic legend and graduate, earned AVCA Sand Volleyball Coach of the Year honors.
In addition to Pepperdine and USC, the preseason poll ranked Florida State No. 3 and Hawaii No. 4. Both teams were participants in last year’s national championship. Long Beach State rounded out the top five. Crosstown rival UCLA is ranked No. 7.
The Women of Troy have a strong home schedule this season that consists of 10 matches, with seven of them being broadcast by the Pac-12 Networks. High-profile home matches include USC hosting No. 1 Pepperdine and No. 8 St. Mary’s. USC will also host the Pac-12 Invitational, which includes Arizona, Arizona State, California and UCLA. The team looks to qualify for the fourth annual AVCA Collegiate Sand Volleyball Championships, which will be held during the first three days of May in Alabama.
The transition for sand volleyball from an emerging sport for women to an NCAA championship sport took a huge leap forward this offseason, as NCAA Division II and Division III membership approved the sport’s addition. A selection and bracketing committee will soon be established. In 2016, USC will be competing for an NCAA national sand volleyball championship. First, however, the Women of Troy seek their first AVCA national championship.
The Women of Troy will play in the Cardinal and Gold Alumni Match on March 5 at Merle Norman Stadium, followed by a scrimmage with the USA Beach National Team on the March 7. USC opens the season with a home match against TCU on March 12.

Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Both honors theses and capstone projects can be a daunting task for seniors. Here’s a peek into what some of our students have been doing for their final research projects.

What is your thesis about?
I’m writing about the effect a model air pollutant has on the expression of autism-associated genes in human neural progenitor cells. I’ve compiled a list of about 13 or so genes; I’ve cultured human normal cell lines, exposed them to environmental air pollution and studied their micro-gene expression to try to determine a pattern.
How have you gone about your research?
My research methods are primarily lab techniques. I’ve also done literature review to try to understand the background of the experiment, but I’m mostly focused on lab techniques like qPCR and cell culturing.
What are some of the obstacles you’ve faced so far?
There have been quite a few obstacles in the lab, including troubleshooting when something doesn’t go as I expected. One of my greatest obstacles has been organizing my time because this semester was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. Planning out my time so I can devote an adequate amount to writing a strong thesis and doing well in my classes during my last semester here is pretty important. Even while I was doing research over the summer, it was difficult to manage my time because my work required being in a lab for an extended amount of time and I had to balance that with other aspects of my life.

What is the topic of your capstone project?
My topic is a mixed media fiction piece with special emphasis on how Christianity influences inter-personal relationships. It will include different kinds of narrative writing, such as poetry, short fiction and screenwriting, and will feature a brief researched component.
What are a few challenges you’ve come across?
It’s quite difficult to stay disciplined when I’m working under restrictions I created myself. On the other hand, the flexibility that an individual project allows makes it much more manageable with my schedule.
What makes this project important to you?
This project is important to me because it has encouraged me to push myself against the boundaries of my abilities. In addition, I’m exploring a topic that I chose for myself because I’m interested in it. I’m lucky enough to have an adviser who supports my work while still holding me to a higher standard and I’m looking forward to having a finished product that feels like a culmination of my years as a narrative studies student.

What is your thesis about?
My thesis is about national self-identification of Korean American adoptees and how adoption and citizenship laws may affect identification. I’m looking at how these laws reflect national attitudes toward transitional adoption both in the United States and in South Korea. I’m researching policies such as the bill that allowed the Holts to adopt several children from Korea after the Korean war and the Special Adoption Law to see how those reflect national attitudes as well as how they influence a Korean American adoptee’s national identification.
Is there personal significance to this area of study?
This topic is important to me because I am a Korean American adoptee. I first visited Korea two years ago and realized how I relied on my national identity more than my racial identity. I became curious about what influenced me to identify as an American in some situations and as Korean in others. It’s also important because of how much transnational adoption has changed between the U.S. and South Korea in the last several years. Researching and understanding transnational and transracial adoption has helped me understand myself as well the adoption context in which I am a part of a little bit better.
What’s something unexpected you’ve learned while working on this project? 
Something unexpected I’ve learned while working on this project is that it’s a lot more work than I initially expected. I knew it was going to be difficult, but there are some things you can’t anticipate. I’m writing this thesis as part of the American Studies and Ethnicity honors program, which is a yearlong course. Last semester, my topic was completely different. It has been really frustrating at times because I want to know exactly what I’m doing but I know all of the hard work will pay off.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics continued its Students Talk Back series in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday afternoon. The discussion titled, “How the Present Affects the Future: The 2016 Presidential Election,” focused on the implications of the country’s current political climate on next year’s presidential election.
The panel featured Professor Bob Shrum, political consultant and Dornsife Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics, and Matt Klink, owner and president of Klink Campaigns.
Co-moderators included Dan Schnur, executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Nathaniel Haas, a columnist for the Daily Trojan.
Schnur and Haas kicked off the conversation by addressing how Hillary Clinton might face a potentially weak cast of competitors in the Democratic primaries. They asked what potential benefits or drawbacks a lack of competition could produce for Clinton’s campaign.
Shrum saw Clinton’s clear road through the primaries as a good thing.
“I don’t think she’ll face a difficult primary,” Shrum said. “I think she basically is at this point the nominee. At this point the only one who could defeat Hilary Clinton is Hillary Clinton.”
Klink discussed how there are positive and negative results that correspond with a weak set of competitors in the Democratic primaries.
“I could argue both [benefits or drawbacks] pretty convincingly.” Klink said. “But I think any candidate going through the rough and tumble, debating other candidates openly and in public has to make sure that you get your head knocked in a couple of times early so you don’t do that late.”
The debate then shifted to the Republican primary when Haas asked whether or not the Republican Party was coalescing around Jeb Bush.
Klink disagreed but explained that he was not impressed with the candidates from either party.
“As an observation in general, I’m kind of disappointed that in a nation of 330 million people that America can’t do better than a Clinton and a Bush to run for president in 2016.” Klink said. “It doesn’t inspire me for the future.”
The topic later shifted to issues of foreign policy. Schnur and Haas asked how these issues could have the potential to be major talking points for the 2016 election, in light of recent high profile events, such as ISIS as well as challenges in the Ukraine and the Pacific Rim.
Klink was skeptical that Clinton would be able to distance herself from her experience as Obama’s secretary of state.
“It’s a mess,” Klink said. “ISIS, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, Europe in general. All of these things are all up in the air, the world is more unstable than it was eight years ago and it doesn’t seem like it will be settling down anytime soon.”
The final question asked by the co-moderators shed light on the concerns of each panelist for the upcoming election.
Shrum began by saying that he was worried that Jeb Bush, who he considered most likely to be the Republican nominee, would be a formidable opponent for the Democratic Party.
”If he can somehow give the sense that he has some ideas that kind of seem mainstream to people, I think he can be a very formidable candidate,” Shrum said.
Klink took a different viewpoint and explained that he is concerned about the issue of finding a well-liked candidate for his party who has the ability to garner attention upon party members.
“The biggest single concern that I have is the pull between nominating a candidate that motivates the base to turn out and nominating a candidate who can win in November,” Klink said. “And the challenge in that, is if Jeb Bush can do it, can Jeb motivate the conservative base to get energized and turned out”.
Schnur summed up the contrasting viewpoints.
“The Democrat’s greatest concern is that the Republicans nominate a relative centrist, and the Republican’s greatest concern is that they don’t.”

Panhellenic sororities participating in continuous open recruitment have extended bids to 64 women this semester. This number shows a significant increase to the amount of women who have chosen to participate in COR.
“This is the first year we’ve seen such large numbers, which can be attributed to more chapters participating in COR,” said Panhellenic President Caroline Cannan. “Last year we had 39 bids, so we’re hoping for a full double.”
COR is an informal recruitment process that takes place during the spring and provides transfer and spring admits a chance to rush for a sorority without having to wait for formal recruitment in the fall.
After formal recruitment was held last fall, chapter totals were increased by National Panhellenic guidelines, allowing several houses the ability to expand. As a result, six out of 12 sororities are participating in continuous open recruitment this semester.
“It’s up to the individual chapters how they pursue [recruitment],” Cannan said. “Some have hosted more publicized formal events while others choose to get to know girls in a very individualized process.”
This semester, recruitment events have ranged from larger activities, such as cookie-decorating parties, to one-on-one outings for coffee or lunch, depending on each chapter’s approach to COR.
Cannan explained that informal recruitment provides a more relaxed alternative to fall recruitment.
“Fall recruitment is a very formalized system where girls visit every house and narrow down day by day, whereas informal recruitment is much more relaxed since you can reach out to the houses that you see a potential fit in,” Cannan said.
Melanie Allegretti, president of Sigma Delta Tau, joined her house through COR and explained that she has found that the less formalized structure brings in several girls each spring. Sigma Delta Tau has extended 14 bids this semester and plans to have a second round of COR in the coming months.
“We love finding more girls with similar values and ideals, so if we can increase our chapter size, we can make a bigger difference in things like philanthropies and making connections,” Allegretti said. “COR is a really fun way to engage with new people on a one-on-one level. I actually met my little through COR last semester.”
New members through COR receive “big sisters” and go through the same general initiation process as individuals who go through formal recruitment. Later in the semester, new members are initiated according to national guidelines so that they are eligible to recruit new members formally by the next fall.
Over 1,000 women participate in formal recruitment each fall, but the opportunity to go through informal recruitment is not as widely known.
To promote COR this year, Panhellenic had representatives at the orientation for spring admits and transfer students to compile a list of women interested in COR, which they gave to eligible chapters. They also answered questions at the involvement fair and sent letters to incoming women about the chapters participating in COR.
“Some girls decide they want to wait [until formal recruitment] and go meet every single chapter, but I encourage those who are even a little open to COR to check it out,” Cannan said. “You never know what connections you’ll be able to make, and if it doesn’t work out, you can always wait.”

USC has officially announced their decision to offer gender neutral housing for students both on and off campus, effective fall 2015.
Last spring, a group of students joined forces with the Queer and Ally Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government to pass a resolution proposing this idea, which was later approved by the university in August 2015.  The negotiation began in the fall of 2013 and has been led solely by students, especially those involved in the queer community.
This spring, USC has offered a gender-neutral housing option on the online housing application.  Students who select this option will be placed in a pool with others who wish to live in  gender-neutral housing.
Freshmen students who opt in will also have the option to choose from on or off campus housing.  Those who decide to live on campus will be placed in Arts and Humanities Residential College at Parkside. Students who choose to live off campus will be placed, along with transfer and continuing students who request gender-neutral housing, in Cardinal Gardens, the Rainbow Floor in Century Apartments or the Annenberg House.
The idea for gender-neutral housing first started after a group of students from QuASA realized how this was a priority for the queer community. The decision to implement gender-neutral housing was heavily dependent on the strong network of LGBTQ students.
Alyssa Coffey, director of QuASA, explained that previously, many students were forced to live off campus to accommodate their desire to live in a gender-neutral space.
“A lot of students had to resort to living off campus because they were not comfortable with gender-exclusive housing, which was the only option USC offered until now,” Coffey said.
Sarah Herald, co-president of the Transgender Advocacy Group, explained that she had to resort to non-USC housing because she and her friends could not find what they were looking for through USC housing.
“Had gender-neutral housing existed in that time period when I was looking for housing, then that would have been very helpful to me,” Herald said. “And there are people I certainly know in this kind of predicament.”
Gender-neutral housing hopes to alleviate this problem for students who are currently experiencing transitions with establishing their gender identity.
“Gender-neutral housing is taking what exists in USC housing to accommodate students who are not comfortable in gender-                                                                                                                                          segregated housing,” Coffey said.
Currently, students who would like to live in gender-neutral housing can apply to the Rainbow Floor or the LGBTQ floor in Century Apartments off campus.
Coffey explained that residential assistants will be specially equipped to handle all matters surrounding gender-                                                                                                           neutral housing.
“Resident assistants that will be placed in floors with these students will be specially selected,” Coffey said.  “They want to make sure that the RAs are able to handle the roommate arrangements and problems that come with gender-neutral housing.”
However, this limited option proved to be difficult for those students if their roommates did not identify themselves as LGBTQ.
“When we were considering USC housing for junior year, we did technically have an option,” Harold said. “But then my roommates who do not identify with LGBTQ would’ve been dragged there to live with me.”
Herald explained how one of the main concerns when passing the resolution was whether or not they could garner enough interest.
“It is very hard to target incoming students, and it might not be clear on the housing application,” Harold said.
Kelby Harrison, the director of the LGBT Resource Center at USC, explained that the application has already been opened for returning students and that they have seen a significant number of people interested.
“Having this resource available makes sure that the Trojan family actually includes all of us, and not a select group of people,” Coffey said.

Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California and former secretary of homeland security, delivered the 37th Earl V. Pullias lecture on campus Wednesday, addressing that a previously announced tuition hike of 5 percent will not affect the upcoming summer quarter for the UC system.
In the lecture, she also addressed the longstanding conversation about higher education in California. The event was hosted by the Pullias Center for Higher Education and the Rossier School of Education.
Napolitano’s lecture titled, “A Trifecta for the Future: Higher Education, California, and Innovation,” also focused on the unique role that research universities have played in making California a center of innovation and a world leader in its own right.
“California, if it is to pay its dream forward to future generations,” Napolitano said. “must never abandon its sense of itself as a society built on innovation, and it must never abandon the institutions that seek that innovation. That is the California that we are fighting for.”
At the start of the lecture, Napolitano referred to participants of previous Pullias Lectures, such as former University of California presidents David P. Gardner and Richard C. Atkinson.
In 1988, Gardner participated in a lecture that discussed global transformations and the internationalized quest for knowledge. He argued that the reach for American research universities such as those within the UC system must be altered. Atkinson reinforced that point in his 1997 lecture by emphasizing how research universities are not only important for economic growth, but also for discovery and the application of knowledge.
Napolitano furthered the lectures of former UC presidents by discussing how Californians have built and nurtured an iconic society known to the world as a beacon of progress and opportunity.
“They [Californians] built it with a native creativity and ceaseless innovation, introducing to the world everything from the Silicon chip to fine Napa Valley wine to the wetsuit,” Napolitano said. “They built it with a strong sense of common purpose, fostering a true commonwealth for those with dreams and ideas and notions about the next big thing. In the spirit of a commonwealth, they built it with a deep commitment to education and research.”
She continued to discuss current problems she believes the UC system needs to address. Napolitano explained that the UC schools are currently receiving the same amount of funding as they had in 1997, with 75,000 more students enrolled now than in 1997.
Napolitano explained that the 75,000 extra students is the equivalent of adding another University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Berkeley without any additional funding from the state.
Napolitano said there are only so many tax dollars to go around, and the education system has to compete with public services, healthcare and corrections for funding. She commented that society has drifted away from the concept of a commonwealth.
“Taxpayers, who used to view education at the University of California as a public investment, increasingly now see it as a private good, one that ought to be paid for by the individuals who derive a direct benefit from it,” Napolitano said.
Joseph Chan, a graduate student studying postsecondary administration and student affairs, said he was interested in how tuition rates were impacted by these increases.
“She [Napolitano] mentioned in her speech that the priorities of the state as far as funding have flipped, causing a tuition increase,” Chan said. “I always questioned, ‘Why is the tuition cost increasing?’, and I never knew the huge role that tax played into that.”
Napolitano ended her lecture by explaining a decision made last November to move forward with a new tuition and financial aid plan in the UC system, which will include increased enrollment of students from California.
The plan means investing and reinvesting in academic quality. Napolitano said that they are serious about the UC school system maintaining both affordability and quality.
Shujin Zhong, a graduate student studying postsecondary administration and student affairs, said she was especially interested in Napolitano’s research on tuition payments.
“Last semester I did some research on tuition fees and came to know that although we’ve paid a lot for tuition, we actually enjoy more [at USC] such as better resources, better faculty members and better services. Also, I would like to hear something more about the international environment at UCs,” Zhong said.
