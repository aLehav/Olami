No. 5 seed men’s volleyball finished their season with a loss in their third consecutive game against No. 4 seed Grand Canyon University in the MPSF Championship Tournament at BYU.
USC won one out of four sets (30-28, 20-25, 17-25, 23-25) and finished the season with an overall record of 5-13. They also finished the season unranked in the American Volleyball Coaches Association top 15. 
Redshirt junior outside hitter Billy Fauntleroy led the Trojans with 18 total kills followed by junior Brandon Browning with 16. USC’s overall hitting percentage was only 31.6% compared to GCU’s 37.5%. 
The Trojans also had a total of 58 kills, compared with 53 by the Antelopes, and 21 errors to GCU’s 14. There was a discrepancy among hitting attempts, with USC finishing with 117 hitting attempts compared to GCU’s 104. The discrepancy between the two teams’ statistics was a bit closer in other categories — USC had 54 assists to GCU’s 52, one ace versus GCU’s six and five blocks compared to GCU’s 7.5. 
In the first set, a six point run gave the Trojans a significant lead, but the Antelopes closed the gap with a four point run. USC held on to win the set by scoring the last two points with a hitting percentage of 50%. 
A three point run in the second set gave the Lopes the point and the third set was taken by GCU after a seven point run put the set out of reach for the Trojans. 
In the must-win set for USC, the teams played neck-and neck-until the Trojans had a four point run. Soon afterward, the Lopes responded and went on a three point run bringing the teams to a tie at 17-17, then establishing a lead of 23-21, eventually taking the set at 25-23.
The Trojans had a number of ups and downs this season, starting off with a win in their first game against UCLA followed by a seven game slump in which they lost seven games in a row. The team broke the slump with a win but still went on to record two more losing streaks of three and four games later on in the season, respectively.
Considering the challenges the team faced, including having a shorter amount of time to practice and prepare for the season as well as rescheduled games and an inconsistent practice schedule, they certainly demonstrated some resilience but will have much room for improvement come next season.

Well folks, we did it. This is the last week of classes and I am signing off as a sports columnist — even if just temporarily. 
It’s crazy to think I started this job during a pandemic … when no sports were happening. I remember the first Daily Trojan sports editor meeting over Zoom — all of us panicking on how we would actually do our jobs without any sports. 
Looking back now, I see how this dilemma forced us out of the sports coverage muscle memory. We couldn’t fall back on the cat and mouse game of recaps and result columns, and we had to push the boundary on our storytelling. We told stories of how athletes were training through this pandemic, how coaches were keeping up team morale and how the events of 2020 forced many into activist roles.
With fans filling stadiums again and almost 100 million Americans vaccinated, the signs are pointing towards a return to normalcy in the sports industry. But, can the media industry return to the pre-pandemic normal with sports teams? I don’t think so.
Nearly all of the articles published by the Daily Trojan sports section were written remotely — save for the few football and basketball games some of us could attend. We reached every coach and player either through prescheduled Zoom conferences or one-on-one phone calls for interviews. 
Without commute times or exact practices to rush to, you would think that interview availability would be easy to sort out. But, that wasn’t the case for many of our writers, and from what I’ve gathered from professional sports journalists, the struggle to connect with team members is industry wide.
Journalists have to go through a PR staff to either gain access to virtual press conferences or gain the contact information for teams. Such an exchange is supposed to be a miniscule business relation, but writers now face stonewalling to build a relationship with sources.
Locker Room interviews — as chaotic as they appear on camera — allow athletes and coaches to see the faces writing about their performance. If you hound a team in your column the next day, there’s at least the accountability measure of having to see them that night in the stadium. 
It’s a relationship dynamic currently being interrupted by PR teams, and I’m afraid of what will happen if this limited access continues. 
Teams want control over their brand, and every interview done by a member of the organization can possibly throw the image carefully crafted. On top of that, athletes tend to have their own large social media following where they can directly break personal news without having to deal with a million journalists wanting the first scoop.
It’s an intimidating dilemma — and I feel the industry holding its breath as the pandemic plays out. Authenticity is what fans want to read, and I’m not sure articles or broadcasts can achieve that without the face-to-face interviews. 
The sports market is on the brink of a boom once again, but that success doesn’t always trickle down to the individual journalists hunting for a new angle about their town’s team. I know our own beat writers struggle, and it’s something athletic organizations need to consider if they want to keep healthy relations with the press.

In a highly anticipated two-game set against crosstown rival No. 3 UCLA, the No. 1 women’s water polo team lost their first game of the season against the Bruins in Westwood on Sunday following a 5-3 win on Saturday. The 17-1 Trojans will now head into the MPSF and NCAA tournament with championship hopes still strong. 
The two-game series began Saturday morning in what was a defensive battle from start to finish. After eight minutes of scoreless play to start the game, junior driver Grace Tehaney was able to find the back of the net, giving the Trojans a 1-0 lead going into the second period.
Just a minute into the second period, redshirt senior utility Maud Megens came in with an assist to junior utility Bayley Weber to put the Trojans ahead on the scoreboard 2-1 through the fourth period. Weber would again contribute with an assist to redshirt senior driver Kelsey McIntosh to put another point on the board 16 seconds into the fourth period. UCLA responded with a goal of its own, but Megens cushioned USC’s lead to 4-2 just 20 seconds later. 
McIntosh hammered the final nail in the coffin with a top corner shot that made the final score 5-2 with 1:33 remaining. The driver attempted six shots throughout the game and added to her season total of 14 goals.
Megens led the squad with seven shots, while Weber rounded out the leaderboard with five shots and two points. This senior lineup has been the backbone of USC’s defense all season, and on Sunday, it became clear the Bruins had adjusted to shut them down. 
The Trojans could not keep up with UCLA’s offensive production. While USC scored the opening goal on a penalty shot from Megens and redshirt senior driver Denise Mammolito, UCLA responded with three straight goals. By halftime, the score remained tight at 5-3.
When USC returned to the water they experienced a scoring drought. The third period slump allowed four UCLA goals, two by junior attacker Val Ayala, and created a deficit the Trojans could not claw back from. Three Trojans would score in the final eight minutes, but the Bruins managed to respond every time and finish with a 13-6 victory. 
Megens again led the Trojans with nine shots and two points, with Mammolito following behind her with six shots and three points. 
This is the first loss for USC since Feb. 9, 2020 against a UCLA squad with many of the same top players. Prior to the loss, the Trojans were on a 23-game winning streak that solidified their top seeding in the upcoming MPSF tournament.
The team will enjoy a week of rest by the virtue of their first-round MPSF tournament bye. They will then travel to Tempe, Ariz. to play in the MPSF semifinals on May 1.

This review contains spoilers.
After almost four months of airing, “RuPaul’s Drag Race” season 13 ended its sixteen-episode run and crowned a winner on Friday. Tied for having the most episodes of any season in the show’s history, season 13 was also the first American season to be filmed entirely during the pandemic. But rather than limiting the show or dampening its joy, the strange new circumstances breathed new life into “Drag Race,” showcasing the persistent power of drag to inspire and producing one of the most entertaining and spectacular seasons in recent memory.
Above all, what made season 13 such a joy to watch was its cast of queens. The thirteen-person roster touted what felt like a particularly diverse variety of talents, drag-styles and personalities. This is evident by even just looking at the season’s top four queens: from Los Angeles-based queen Gottmik’s edgy clown-white makeup to New-York-City-based Kandy Muse’s wild brand of humor, there was someone for everyone to root for.
The season’s champion — L.A.-based Symone — was a fantastic addition to the exclusive list of queens crowned America’s Next Drag Superstar on the show. Throughout the season, Symone rocked the runway with her high-fashion looks that celebrated Black culture and won over judges and viewers alike with her lovable personality and candid vulnerability.
While the crown will rest well on Symone’s perfectly-styled wigs, this season was truly a race all the way to the finish line. Although Symone was a frontrunner from the beginning, competition was stiff with queens such as finalists Rosé and Gottmik all excelling in different areas. It was a close call all the way up until the very end, which made the season all the more exciting to watch.
One thing Season 13 will be remembered for is its excellent runways. Producers came up with original categories like beast couture, beads and fascinators that encouraged queens to think outside the box and bring their best drag — and the cast delivered.
Week after week, the queens brought elevated looks to the mainstage, exemplifying the high bar that “Drag Race” has set and the increasing intersection of drag and the high-fashion world. This level of expertise was upheld in design challenges too, with Minnesota-based Utica Queen delivering one of the most impressive looks ever made in the workroom, created entirely from sleeping bags for the “Bag Ball” challenge.
In addition to serving jaw-dropping runways, season 13 also brought the laughs. This season’s iteration of the show’s infamous “Snatch Game” celebrity impersonation challenge was especially impressive with Gottmik and Rosé, again, as definite standouts. Chicago-based queen Denali and Atlanta-based queen LaLa Ri delivered wonderful, high-energy lip syncs, checking yet another box for what makes a good season of the show.
Newer seasons of “Drag Race” often receive some criticism from fans who believe the show has become overproduced and less authentic throughout the years. Unfortunately, season 13 doesn’t make a great case against the argument. Producer meddling was apparent from the first episode, where, in a twist, the queens all lip-synced two-by-two immediately upon arriving. The queens who lost their lip syncs were then separated from those who won, and the two groups each got their own traditional premiere episode.
This twist was clearly employed to create tension within the cast and produce a “winners vs. losers” storyline that could be utilized throughout the season. However, pairings and judging in the episode favored some queens more than others, and the show never really took the storyline it worked so hard to set up anywhere interesting.
Instead, it just robbed viewers of the delight of getting to see all the queens first meet in the workroom, as well as produced a boring, repetitive episode that failed to showcase the plethora of talents the cast had. Luckily, the premiere proved to be just a brief misstep.
Judging throughout the season was questionable at times as well, but “Drag Race” fans have come to expect this. Denali landed in the bottom twice for minor offenses while judges seemed to overlook flaws in other queens’ performances. NYC-based queen Tina Burner was given passes for underwhelming looks all season, then booted abruptly, essentially because the judges were tired of her.
Luckily, judging inspired only minor frustration. Every queen presented who they are and what they do — even first-eliminated Kahmora Hall got to showcase her glamorous fashion for three episodes due to the season’s lengthiness. Even though the season narrowed its pool of contestants slowly, it didn’t feel like it dragged. Instead, extra time with queens felt like the show respected their art and allowed audiences to get to know them and their drag as much as possible.
Overall, season 13 of “Drag Race” possessed a joyful quality that’s hard to pinpoint. Maybe it was a result of newfound gratefulness in the wake of the national lockdown. Maybe it was queens like Symone and Gottmik — the first transgender man to compete on the show — representing their communities with such grace and pride. Or maybe the cast of queens possessed a stronger chemistry with each other than other casts have. Maybe it was for all of those reasons and more.
Whatever it was, season 13 was an absolute joy to watch and the show’s best since the similarly excellently-cast season nine. If the show continues to cast such talented, diverse groups of queens, it’s exciting to think where it could be. The show carries the heavy responsibility of bringing drag — and queer culture — to mainstream audiences, but it still has fun doing so.

I am typically not one to give advice, but seeing as this column will likely be the last thing I will ever write at the Daily Trojan, it feels appropriate to reflect on some of my experiences and share what I’ve learned. 
I realize that, given the name of this column and its theme throughout the semester, some grand treatise on political literature and its significance might’ve been more apt. I’ll touch on that idea before this is over, but it won’t be some grand treatise, and if a USC education is still worth anything, it shouldn’t take my column for you to already recognize the significance for yourself. 
None of the suggestions I will provide are gospel. However, I do feel pretty confident about them, and I’d venture to say that most of them — assuming you don’t follow them already — will make your reading life easier and a bit more enjoyable. 
I’ll begin with a maxim that I only recently began to adhere to, and it’s one that has drastically changed my reading life: Read more than one book at a time. 
If someone had told me that a year ago, I would’ve run, convinced that they had been sent to tempt me into descending into reading ruin. How would I be able to keep multiple narratives and characters straight across several books along with the already voluminous and disparate sets of information and tomes that were already being foisted onto me by my professors?
Well, the answer was and is: quite easily. Even though I’ve only recently begun practicing this reading tenet, it’s drastically improved my reading stamina and, to an extent, the enjoyment I derive from reading. Also, longer reads become far more bearable when they can be broken up by the likes of Tolkien or Carver whenever your primary book of choice begins to feel like more of a chore than a treat. 
I would caution, however, to make sure that two books of the same genre are not read at the same time. I admit, keeping two books of the same genre straight is not the hardest thing to do in the world — after all, classes at USC frequently require you to read and comprehend approximately 1,200 books at a time. Still, splitting genres does make reading just a bit less mentally taxing, and reading two biographies or two novels at a time just sounds tedious and excruciating.
My second bit of advice is to understand that it’s perfectly okay to put a book down. Again, about two years ago, I would’ve assumed that anyone trumpeting could’ve accurately been labeled a schmuck or a reading-lightweight, but my reading habits have changed dramatically in the past year or so, and learning when to put a book down has been the biggest reason for that. 
Previously, I believed that once I had begun a book, it had to be completed, no matter how boring or arduous reading became. Starting a book was like entering into a sacred blood pact or starting a new season of “Love Island” — no matter how difficult things became or how horrifying what took place on screen was, you had to finish what you signed up for. As you might expect, this conviction was remarkably wrong-headed.
Put simply, if you’re not enjoying a book or just don’t really feel like reading it anymore, just call it quits and put the damn thing down. The same goes for “Love Island,” less so for blood pacts. 
Finally, do the reading. 
I’ll admit, I’m borrowing a bit from Ezra Klein here (this was one the final lessons he offered listeners during his final podcast on Vox), but the lesson directly touched on a general feeling of mine that developed toward the end of the fall semester. 
Today, politics is seemingly more democratized than it ever has been in American history. I don’t mean “democratized” in the sense that voting is more accessible than ever — the Republican party appears to be working quite hard to halt and reverse democratization in that arena. I mean “democratized” in the sense that the information, both good and bad, and the means necessary to effectively contribute, participate and influence public political discourse is more accessible than ever. 
As a result, it often feels that slogans, buzzwords, personalities, summaries and summaries of summaries have begun to dictate our political views, rather than merely inform them.
This is why actually doing the reading is so invaluable. The challenges we face are potentially calamitous, and solving them requires a level of nuance that is seldom captured through the common mediums many now understand politics through, such as social media, television and quick explainers, to name a few. 
So, please, if the future of the U.S. and its nearly 330 million residents mean anything to you, pick up a newspaper, magazine or book and actually do the reading.

Visual artist, production designer and Roski senior Mackenzie Starr has found art as a way to conceptualize difficult emotions and ideas of life to share with the public.
Growing up, Starr’s grandma was a painter and a sculptor. Since early childhood, she grew up doing art of all different kinds, particularly paintings. Her supportive family allowed her to stay passionate about art for so long that she ended up pursuing a fine arts major at USC.
Starr has a variety of mediums she is passionate about when it comes to art, including mixed media, oil paintings, sound art and installation.
“I really like combining different things with art and interdisciplinary studies … I’ve combined sound art with a lot of my paintings,” Starr said.
Starr draws her inspiration for her art from the people around her. She uses them as inspiration to explore themes of memory and loss through her artwork.
“Oftentimes, I’m interviewing friends, or kind of taking deep dives into myself, or researching artists, and drawing inspiration from what’s already been done,” Starr said.
Art is so important to Starr because it’s become a way for her to understand complicated and difficult things. She views her artwork as a productive way to connect with other people. 
“I find that the most gratifying part of art is connecting with other people and having other people see your art and resonate with it,” Starr said.
As a result of being stuck inside because of the pandemic, Starr has been devoting much of her time to oil painting. However, she has also been dedicating a lot of time to production design, which is how she hopes to continue her art career professionally. 
Starr has been working on several undergraduate and graduate student films, making posters and designing sets. She has simultaneously had to endure the difficulties of creating inspiring art this year when life has felt paused, challenging her to produce even when she hasn’t felt like it.
Many aspects of art apply to production design, like color theory, aesthetics and telling stories visually. A lot of Starr’s paintings don’t depict people, they are mostly object-based and tell human stories.
Nerris Nassiri, who created a film known as “Brokenhearted Magic,” a proof of concept about five women who practice magic and experienced racism and sexism along the way, hired Starr as his production designer. Starr was in charge of props, costumes and designing sets, all while staying under budget.
“She tells a story with her set design and I think that’s really special and it’s really unique to the point where she brought out through the props and through the set decoration facets of the character that I wrote that I didn’t even think of,” Nassiri said. “So I think that makes her someone who will have a very big impact in working with directors on really unique genre or period films, because she really is able to collaborate.” 
Karen Liebowitz, a professor at the Roski School of Art and Design, has worked with Starr for several years as a professor and mentor. She has seen her grow tremendously in talent and the way she represents diverse stories and perspectives through her art.
“Historically there have only been certain voices that have really gotten center stage and the world has been changing and it’s still in need of more change and I know that Mackenzie cares a lot about representation and not just within aspects of her own identity like queer and female, but just with any underrepresented groups,” Liebowitz said. “I anticipate her to be a champion for new perspectives.”
Liebowitz also mentions that as a very young artist, Starr has her whole career ahead of her to be a refreshing and needed voice in the art world.
In order to further share her work, Starr has jumped onto social media. She recently got back on Instagram and has been creating a website for her artwork as well, finding a new outlet beyond Roski to connect with the art community. 
Moving forward, Starr wants to use her art to be a part of the positive push towards morality, diversity and inclusivity in Hollywood that’s happening now. She wants to help create impactful films that are ethically made, while continuously sharing her art with the world.

After a year of offering the legal studies minor and in response to students’ increased interests in social justice and immigration-related issues, the USC Gould School of Law will offer two more specialized minors. 
Gould’s new law and social justice and law and migration studies minors will be offered beginning in Fall 2021. According to Robert Rasmussen, the J. Thomas McCarthy Trustee chair in law and political science, it is beneficial for people to familiarize themselves with the law, regardless of their professional background. 
“We added the specialized minors, each for an independent reason … The immigration minor is really targeted for people who want to understand some of the complexities of the current immigration crisis in this country,” Rasmussen said. “The second minor is a touch broader, it’s focused on issues of social justice, and our conception of that is the required courses give you a background in law and then the elective courses you can decide what aspect of social justice you want to learn more about.”
Most of Gould’s students are pursuing juris doctor degrees, and the school does not offer any undergraduate majors. Gould began offering undergraduate minors because law affects everyone, and students can broaden their education by understanding the concept of law and its impact on society. 
Maddy Zamany, the director of undergraduate programs at Gould, said getting the new minors added to the undergraduate programs was the product of teamwork and collaboration from Gould faculty. Zamany believes that the minors will be attractive to undergraduate students because Gould is one of the top 20 law schools in the country. She also believes the minors are unique because 95% of the faculty that teach the courses are full-time Gould faculty that also teach J.D. students. 
“It all goes back to our mission statement for the office of the undergraduate programs at Gould, which is to educate undergraduate students [and] to introduce them to the concepts of law early on in their education so that they can contribute to society in a more meaningful way as informed citizens,” Zamany said. “Law is everywhere, so we want to make sure that our undergraduate students are informed, they know basic concepts of law in order to help them through their education and also through life.”
The law and social justice minor is an 18-unit program that will teach students about the present justice system and provide critical-analytical skills to understand where changes to society must be made. The minor also provides an interdisciplinary approach, as it can be satisfied by elective courses from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. 
Olivia Tyler, a sophomore majoring in journalism, was one of the first students to declare a minor in law and social justice. While Tyler originally went to a political science adviser to declare a political science minor, she ended up signing up for a minor in Gould because she said it offered exactly what she wanted. 
“I’m very interested in social justice,” Tyler said. “As a minority, it’s important to understand the law, and be educated on what your rights are, and I’ve always wanted to fight for people who look like me.”
The 20-unit law and migration studies minor introduces students to the American legal system by looking at it through the lens of immigration law, how it affects communities in the United States and the consequences it has for society, both domestically and internationally.
The curriculum for the minor allows students to understand the complex concepts of immigration law and migration studies, and also equips students with an interdisciplinary approach through elective courses offered through Dornsife and the Sol Price School of Public Policy. 
Rasmussen said that the law and migration studies minor “allows for people who care a lot about issues of immigration to be “sophisticated consumers on the news.” He said that sometimes, people hear about immigration on the news but do not understand what the ground rules are or who the major stakeholders are in these situations. 
“Part [of this minor] is courses about immigration law, so people know the parameters, and then there are also courses not taught by the law school, but by other parts of USC, about some of the policy choices that we make,” Rasmussen said. “Law is how we implement the policy choices, but law doesn’t determine what they are … and the other courses help frame your thinking of, ‘What should our stance be as a country towards immigration?’”
Rasmussen said that he hopes undergraduate students who take Gould’s courses “understand how law impacts what they’re doing,” even if they’re not going to law school or planning on pursuing law further.  
“I think for too long, when you look at undergrad education, there wasn’t enough …  opportunities to understand how law fits into what you’re learning as an undergraduate,” Rasmussen said. “Law is a social product. It shapes our society, and if you think a lot of what we’re studying as undergrads are issues that affect our society, law is part of that.”

The premise for Peacock’s new sitcom “Rutherford Falls,” which premiered on the streaming service April 22, sounds great: A descendent of a small town’s white founder is obsessed with preserving his family’s history, ignoring the history of the town’s Native American reservation. Throw in the lead actor and co-creator Ed Helms along with Sierra Teller Ornelas’ fresh voice and Michael Schur’s sitcom magic, and you have the makings of an instant hit. 
Unfortunately, the first three episodes of the streaming series don’t totally live up to their potential. While the story  brings a new refreshing perspective to television, it falls short of becoming a conversation-changer or a comedic hit. 
“Rutherford Falls” follows the big-hearted yet stubborn Nathan Rutherford (played by Helms) after the town mayor (Dana L. Wilson) wants to move Big Larry, the statue of Nathan’s colonial ancestor, which sits directly in the middle of a town road. 
He agrees at first, convinced by his best friend Reagan (Jana Schmieding) that it would stir up good will with the town’s citizens and bring in more business for his town history museum. When he learns that the people of Rutherford couldn’t care less about Big Larry, he vows to do everything in his power to keep it in its place. 
Helms is funny and likable, keeping us from completely hating his character, but Nathan seems a bit out of place in his own story. He has good intentions and is not purposely insensitive, but he shouldn’t be allowed to be so out-of-touch. The creators’ choice with their protagonist is obviously deliberate, but it’s unclear why. Do we really still need an ignorant white man to be the catalyst for starting important conversations? No. 
Schmieding plays the dynamic, loveable Reagan Wells, a member of the fictional Native Minishonka people who runs a cultural center attached to the Nation’s casino. However, it is often mistaken for a gift shop. Like Nathan, she’s more interested in her culture’s history than the actual people, and pretty much every other Minishonka individual hates her. 
Reagan’s journey involves reckoning with her past, vying for an updated culture center from the tribal leader and her boss (Michael Greyeyes) and falling in love with the exciting out-of-town journalist (Dustin Milligan). Her storyline is much easier to invest in than Nathan’s barely noteworthy desire to keep his statue in place. The show would’ve been much better served if it focused on Reagan instead of easily throwing her aside in favor of Nathan’s funny but overdone temper tantrums. 
It’s hard to find something to root for in the first few episodes. Reagan is interesting and Schmieding is impressive, but her story isn’t central or gripping enough to carry the show. We don’t want Nathan to win his ridiculous fight, but he isn’t showing any signs of being open to learning or growing. Terry, the Minishonka leader, is portrayed as the show’s antagonist, a capitalistic shark who decides to sue Nathan in the second episode. However, he seems like more of a good guy in the culture clash with Nathan, leaving the audience with nothing that really draws us in. 
“Rutherford Falls” also falls short in terms of comedy. The actors are all impressive and the writing is pleasant, but the jokes are often predictable and underwhelming. The lack of an engaging plot could be compensated for by insanely funny characters, as we’ve seen with some of Schur’s hits like “The Office.” There are moments of wit and hilarity in this show, but it does a better job of reaching for laughs than delivering them. 
The show’s strength comes from bringing up the conversation about Indigenous history. With five Indigenous writers, the show provides new perspectives and lets the characters be real people instead of using them solely for a political agenda. The authentic Native American experience is something too often left out of mainstream entertainment, and “Rutherford Falls” creates a non-judgemental space for audiences to confront this. 
Overall, “Rutherford Falls” is, like its protagonist, well-intentioned but a little misguided. It has the recipe of a great show, so perhaps it just needs a little more time to get there. It’s a charming and light-hearted way to present important topics, but it has trouble balancing its roles as both a conversation-starter and a sitcom.

The coronavirus ripped away the ubiquitous luxuries of cafes, restaurants and movie theaters. Instead, parks became the new normal. High school football fields became the backdrop for college students playing ultimate frisbee. Lakes were the accompaniment to idyllic picnics and barbecues in the late summer. Playgrounds became the escape for toddlers to frolic in, and parents to tire in. In the South Central community, parks even became safe havens from crime and violence. 
In fact, three in four Americans live within walking distance of a park. For USC students, this would be our very own Exposition Park. A 160-hectare urban park, Expo Park has all the potential to be the South Central escape. However, 6.3 violent crimes occur every week. To those who have visited, Expo Park is a sad backdrop to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Now, it needs to be brought to the forefront.
Unknown to most people, parks are vital to our own prosperity. USC needs to invest in Exposition Park because it will be a huge source of economic, social and environmental benefits.
The more parks are used, the more personal economic benefits are gained. It’s a simple feedback loop: As more people go to the parks, demand for services will increase, so more firms will come to the area, who will then invest in local initiatives that make the park nicer, which will eventually incentivize more visitors to come to the park. Local parks have generated more than $166 billion in economic activity and supported more than 1.1 million jobs since 2017. Surprisingly, parks are more than a force of nature; they are a force of profit.
Socially, the revival of parks could even be a tool to achieve equity. Community engagement initiatives may help foster a sense of community, bridging the wealth differences between neighborhoods. A USC-Expo Park partnership would nurture the South Central area, making it a safer location for residents and students alike. 
In the late 1950s, the University of Chicago undertook the first park renewal initiative. Through joint projects with the City of Chicago, the University physically reshaped the low-income, very dangerous Hyde Park region. It removed derelict buildings, replacing them with the green new wave. Hyde Park experienced an economic boom, bringing a stability and safety that has turned it into one of the most sought-after urban residential areas. This is promising for the South Central neighborhood and USC.
Furthermore, parks are environmental miracle workers. Over a 50 year lifetime, one tree generates $31,250 worth of oxygen, provides $62,000 worth of air pollution control, recycles $37,500 worth of water and controls $31,250 worth of soil erosion. For us, the air is breathable, the ground walkable and the trees pleasurable. Both the aesthetic and environmental benefits of parks make it an unmissable opportunity for our future and that of the planet.
Before USC invests in Expo Park, it needs to ensure it is contributing to green gentrification. South Central is a historically underserved area, and without proper foresight, Expo Park may fall victim to the same fate as USC Village. It must make sure it does not drive up housing prices and push out the local residents. USC should thus integrate community involvement into their investment.
USC should partner with L.A. County to revamp Expo Park. The danger of the South Central area is often touted as the main downside of USC; revamping the local area by way of investing in parks can only be beneficial. It is time the parks become our ubiquitous luxuries, and it is time USC begins to take a role in making its community happier, healthier and safer.
