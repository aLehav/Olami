Sometimes, life imitates art. Other times, art is the cushion against life, particularly when the going gets tough. Of the many historical trends coming to light amid the coronavirus pandemic, one of the most salient is the enduring power of art in times of turmoil. 
A recent Nielsen report indicates that the coronavirus crisis may lead to a 60% increase in the amount of content streamed online. Yes, that’s 60% more than the excessive amount of content we already typically consume in a non-quarantine situation. Nielsen also looked at media consumption during past crises — namely, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and a major snowstorm in New York in 2016. Unsurprisingly, TV use increased by similar rates — 56% and 45%, respectively — in both cases.
Obviously, in large part, people are turning to their screens to stay informed and pass the time. When group gatherings and many outdoor activities are no longer an option, it only makes sense to resort to the virtual world. But I don’t think that captures the full scope of our dependence on the arts. 
As illustrator and senior lecturer at the University of Portsmouth Louis Netter so eloquently put it: “People are dying, critical resources are stretched and the very essence of our freedom is shrinking — and yet we are moved inward … Of all the necessities we now feel so keenly aware of, the arts and their contribution to our well-being is evident and, in some ways, central to coronavirus confinement.”
Whether fleeing the eye of a hurricane, trapped passively in one’s own home or awaiting the end of war, it seems to me that once basic needs (safety, sustenance and shelter) are met, there is an emptiness that the arts can fill. And as time passes, they fill that emptiness in fresh, idiosyncratic ways.
Italians are belting out impromptu opera songs from the confinement of their balconies. An entire generation is raptured by the Netflix original, “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” EDM artists are turning to YouTube to host virtual raves and festivals (however that works), Zack Bia’s live DJ sets are popping off and beat, R&B and hip-hop battles on Instagram are basically fostering a whole new form of musical entertainment. It is clear that, whether we realize it or not, the role of art becomes more central to our lives in times of crisis and isolation.
Indeed, throughout history, the arts have interacted with periods of turmoil in powerful ways. Picasso’s “Guernica,” a 1937 anti-war painting inspired by the bombing of a town in Northern Spain by Nazi Germany, took on a life beyond the canvas and became a marker of modern warfare and humanity that still resonates with audiences today. 
More recently, photographer Nan Goldin’s intimate documentation of her own addiction to opioids is a powerful meditation on America’s opioid crisis that other forms of interpretation fail to access. For better or for worse, good art created during moments of uncertainty and struggle have unique longevity and iconicity. I’m certain there is great art being created right now, and I’m certain it will serve as a visceral reminder of this pandemic for years to come.
Beyond the power of art to simply reflect reality lies its ability to protect us from it. A 2008 study conducted by China’s Sun Yat-Sen University and England’s University of Southampton sought to investigate just that. Believe it or not, the center’s experiments with migrant children, college students and factory workers showed that nostalgia can act as a buffer against loneliness. According to the research, nostalgia has a restorative function in that it creates with others symbolic connections strong enough to combat the very real pangs of isolation. If you ask me, this phenomenon and our quarantine-induced return to childhood classics like “Zoey 101” are no coincidence. Right now, art can play an underrated but integral role in our coping. 
On the other hand (you knew this was coming), the idea that we can all find ubiquitous comfort in art during this crisis is deceptive and, quite honestly, too good to be true. Some can’t access luxuries like streaming platforms; for those who can, the “power of art” does little to curb the darkness of living in an abusive household or having dire mental health needs that are not being met. Some are living in constant danger that makes the idea of turning to art sound trivial and stupid. 
National Domestic Violence Hotline Chief Executive Katie Ray-Jones expects to see rates of abuse escalate during quarantine in frequency and intensity — a pattern recorded during the economic downturn of 2008 and after 9/11, hurricanes Sandy and Katrina. Some people are trapped with their abusers, trapped in their minds and trapped in poverty — situations that make many of our quarantine experiences seem peachy. 
I’m not trying to go against everything I just said — if you can turn to art, you should, as much as possible. It will probably help a great deal. I also want to recognize that, in the vein of Maslow’s hierarchy, safety and psychological needs always come first. They are the foundation on which the pyramid of self-actualization is built. Art is the icing, not the cake itself. Without the cake, you have way bigger problems on your hands than whether Carole Baskin fed her husband to the tigers.
It is important to remember that while content consumption and innovative art may be making the difference for you and many others during this time, it is the last priority for some. We should welcome the comfort and transcendence of art with open arms, without letting a false sense of universality fool us.

If you are too stubborn to download TikTok but are in need of mindless entertainment to watch between Zoom classes, tune in to these high-quality reality television picks that are worth every second of your time. 
“The Bachelor: Listen to Your Heart”
“The Bachelor” — what a classic. You can forget all about the chaos that was Peter Webber’s season with the latest series from “The Bachelor” franchise. “The Bachelor: Listen to Your Heart” combines music and love as 20 single men and women explore romantic relationships with one another. They sing songs as individuals and couples, attempting to find love through their collective passion for music. 
The trailer already promises plenty of arguments, guitars and enough tears to keep you hooked for a while. As one of the contestants puts it: “It’s no fun singing a love song when you’re not in love.” Now that is something worth watching. “The Bachelor: Listen to Your Heart” is set to premiere April 13 on ABC. 
“Glow Up”
For the makeup enthusiasts out there, “Glow Up” is a competition show where aspiring makeup artists compete for a contract with a leading makeup artist. The 10 contestants are pushed to craft looks in a variety of challenges, ranging from high-fashion editorials to using prosthetics in their art. 
“Glow Up” delivers fabulous facial art as the contestants put their vision and talent into each challenge. This show is perfect for any fans of “Project Runway” and “Skin Wars.” The diverse cast of contestants promises to entertain you and possibly even inspire you to recreate a look you’ve seen on Instagram. “Glow Up” is available to stream on Netflix. 
“Love is Blind”
A bride running down the street on her wedding day, couples getting engaged without ever seeing each other, emotions running wild and more are all featured in Netflix’s new dating show “Love Is Blind.”
Hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, “Love is Blind” is a test to see whether single men and women are able to form emotional connections without ever seeing each other. Each person is placed in a “pod” across from someone else, where they get to know one other through “blind” dates.
Eventually, couples get engaged and see each other for the first time in a grand gesture that could give Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. However, the real test is how their relationship continues to develop outside the show. To find out the results of this social experiment, make sure to stream “Love is Blind,” now available on Netflix. 
“The Masked Singer”
“The Masked Singer” follows a simple premise: It’s a singing competition with celebrities disguised in costumes. Each week, the contestant with the fewest audience votes gets unmasked. 
This all sounds incredibly silly, but the show manages to grab your attention with over-the-top outfits that resemble a mix between extravagant Halloween costumes and Met Gala attire. The show keeps the viewer guessing who could possibly be under the mask. Some singers to be unmasked are easier to guess than others, but you can never quite tell if the person will be a famous athlete, actress or politician. “The Masked Singer” is so bad that it’s good, and it’s available for streaming now on FOX and Hulu. 
“Terrace House” 
Unlike other high-energy reality TV shows infamous for their abundance of emotion, “Terrace House” delivers entertainment in a slow, leisurely way.
While it is not filled to the brim with drama, the Japanese reality show is calming and refreshing. It features six strangers living in a beautiful mansion surrounded by a forest. The house, complete with state-of-the-art furnishing and modern aesthetics, has various cameras placed throughout the rooms. Viewers are able to watch the housemates as they befriend each other and talk about their backgrounds, dreams and morals. 
The audience follows the strangers as they go to restaurants or their day jobs, offering a glimpse into contemporary life in Japan. There is also a group of studio commentators that watch along with the viewer; these commentators analyze conversations, body language and other interactions between the housemates. “Terrace House” is peaceful and relaxing, and will boost serotonin levels in the middle of a global pandemic. It is available to stream on Netflix. 
“The Circle”
A mix between “Big Brother” and “Catfish,” “The Circle” has contestants scheming to see how far they would go to win $100,000. In lieu of real human interaction, the eight contestants interact through a platform called The Circle. Here, the players make friends and enemies as they strategize a way to gain enough popularity to remain in the game, crafting social media personas — real or fake. 
Apart from being a reality television show, “The Circle” runs an interesting social experiment to see who exactly someone has to be in order to rate highly and become a crowd favorite. It’s the concept of the “Black Mirror” episode “Nosedive” brought to life, as contestants either climb the social ladder or are eliminated by the group. Head to Netflix, where you can watch “The Circle” and see what it takes to become an influencer.

The rapidly-evolving situation surrounding the coronavirus has completely transformed the USC college experience. Many students hurriedly packed away their belongings into storage rooms before jetting across the globe back home. Other students left without collecting their things and must wait an unforeseeable amount of time before USC allows them to pick up their items. Most students left campus without saying goodbye to all their friends, whom they will not see again for months. 
Students certainly face an extremely wide range of different situations, but disruption, chaos and abrupt lack of closure bind these unique circumstances together. Assuming that students will be able to resume in-person classes for the Fall 2020 semester, USC should offer a Welcome Week that takes into account the unprecedented ways students had to leave campus the prior semester. 
The week before classes begin, in what is known as Welcome Week, the University usually offers several different events for students to bond and get to know one another, which often include a Welcome Back concert, a comedy show, Explore L.A. and a Visions and Voices event.
Typically, this week is directed at incoming freshmen and transfer students. However, the upcoming Welcome Week should also include activities that acclimate all students back to USC, many of whom will not have seen their campus or each other in a long and chaotic five months. 
This semester, freshmen and transfer Spring 2020 admits only spent nine weeks on USC’s campus before they were advised to leave. Welcome Week should focus on also supporting those admitted for Spring 2020 by allowing more people to participate in Explore L.A. events. Since Spring 2020 admits did not even have a full semester to find organizations and meet people, the University should support them similar to how freshmen and transfers are supported in the fall. 
Welcome Week support should also be extended to all returning sophomores, juniors and seniors. “AskMe Booths” are usually set up around campus for freshmen to ask questions about where things are located on campus as well as any other Welcome Week questions. Similar to this, there can be “AskMe Booths” related to the coronavirus for returning students who need help understanding how the pandemic will impact housing, classes or other parts of the USC experience. 
Friends and Neighbors Day, a program that pairs student volunteers with community partners for a day of service, is another event offered during Welcome Week. Friends and Neighbors Day for Fall 2020 provides the perfect opportunity for students to help those in the local community hurt by the coronavirus — whether it be because of unemployment, illness or any other factor. This event could put into perspective for students the effect the pandemic has had on people outside the college community. 
Welcome Week can provide a way for older students to reconnect with friends after an abrupt departure from school last semester. Instead of just a pool party or concert, there should be additional laid-back events that allow students to talk and catch up after many months apart. Surely, when everyone returns, they will crave chances to bond and reconnect with friends and the college experience like never before.
By catering Welcome Week to everyone, the University can facilitate relationships across grade levels while allowing Spring 2020 and Fall 2020 admits to meet more people and feel more integrated into the USC community. The primary objective of the Fall 2020 Welcome Week should be to promote cohesion between students and renew feelings of spirit and community both inside and outside of campus. 
Everything is extremely uncertain right now, and a large-scale Welcome Week may not even be possible in August given current health concerns. There is no doubt that Welcome Week should take a backseat to the safety of students and communities. However, when the conditions are safe again, USC should consider events that connect and support all students. A Welcome Week — or any week of events whenever possible — that caters to the entire community would remind people what it means to be part of the Trojan Family.

Tuition at USC scrapes $60,000, while head football coach Clay Helton took home over $3 million last year. President Carol Folt earns a base salary of over $1 million, not including potential benefits. Senior administrators and professors bring in a respectable income as well. There is no shame in profit. I assume individuals earning these whopping sums bring in more money to the institution than they take out. Many of them truly earn these salaries. 
Custodial staff, food workers and service providers don’t make nearly as much. But their work is just as vital to the University. They provide students with essentials needs, keep us safe and take care of many behind-the-scenes activities that ensure a high quality of life on campus. 
But now, when campus is nearly empty, they may soon find themselves out of a job. USC must work to keep these employees on the payroll.
As students, we should commend Folt for taking a 20% pay cut and the rest of the senior leadership for taking a 10% pay cut. They’ve put their money where their mouth is, but the question remains: How will USC alter its budget through this crisis? Near the top of the school’s list of priorities should be continuing to employ USC workers, which has several benefits. 
First, it will better the reputation of the University both nationally and locally. Second, it will preserve the safety of the neighborhood. And third, it’s just the right thing to do. Let’s talk these through one by one. 
It’s no secret that USC’s national reputation could use a little boost. Of course, no press is bad press. USC’s profile has certainly risen in the last decade, making it comparable to some of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. But I’m talking about the reputation in terms of the University’s character. The repeated scandals have revealed tendencies not all Trojans are proud of, to say the least. Continuing to pay USC workers would showcase a reset in University culture — especially when schools such as Harvard University, which has over $40 billion in its endowment, has refused to pay its custodial staff. 
USC’s endowment is substantially less than Harvard’s — only $5.7 billion. Nonetheless, it is more than the GDP of several countries. USC does not lack money, and taking this step will raise the University’s image, especially in comparison to other schools with, let’s call it, less-than-generous administration. 
Besides the national reputation, an enactment of this policy will combat the USC stigma in the local community. There is little denying that USC’s construction projects have caused gentrification in the local community, driving up rents and forcing families to move out. We can debate the intentions and repercussions of gentrification all day long, but the reality is that the surrounding neighborhoods may not be our biggest fans. While construction projects may help with supplying student housing and appealing to an elite class of families across the country, it overlooks the needs of locals. 
That said, USC is heavily involved in helping the surrounding neighborhoods, administering programs including various professional clinics, such as the Good Neighbors Campaign, Scholars Leading Scholars and countless others. USC likely hires hundreds of workers from its surrounding neighborhoods; this is precisely why the University must keep them hired. 
In that same vein, the school should consider the implications of laying off hundreds of workers. The University Park neighborhood is one of the poorest in Los Angeles, with the median household income clocking in at $18,533 in 2008. Laying off workers will increase poverty in the surrounding neighborhood, and there is a direct correlation between poverty and crime. USC has made tremendous strides in keeping its students safe, but there’s always room for improvement and none for regression. 
And finally, let’s not forget that all USC workers are also part of the valued Trojan Family. A decision to keep them in the family will show that the University means it when it says that Trojans care for Trojans. If for no other reason, the University should keep its workers on the payroll because it can afford it, because it exemplifies the characteristics of the Trojan Family and because it will make us all proud.

With the cancellation of the NCAA’s remaining spring sports schedule, the coronavirus pandemic is imposing unprecedented financial strain on college athletic departments. Faced with the loss of ticket sales and TV revenue for the foreseeable future, many programs are getting creative to absorb the unexpected decline in profits.
Iowa State University recently announced a one-year pay reduction for coaches and some other athletic department staff members that will save the school $3 million. Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard explained that his department’s expenses were so highly concentrated among its highest-paid coaches and staff that he would have to lay off all of his administrative employees and cut entire sports to pay their full salaries amid the financial downturn.
The mere fact that Iowa State is forced to trim coaches’ exorbitant salaries to avert widespread cuts throughout its athletic department not only reflects a broader trend concerning the pandemic but also underscores the absurdity of football and basketball coaches’ pay in college sports today.
It’s no secret that big-time college coaches command massive salaries. Following his second national championship in January 2019, Clemson head football coach Dabo Swinney secured the largest contract in college football history — a whopping $93 million 10-year contract, making him the highest-paid public employee in South Carolina. 
To make matters worse, Swinney is not an anomaly. In 2017, the highest-paid public employee in 39 states was a college football or basketball coach.
Defenders of college head coaches’ massive salaries often argue that those salaries reflect their market value because they generate so much revenue for their respective schools; it’s true that football and basketball are the primary revenue streams in college athletics, often bringing in the majority of the money necessary to fund other sports. 
At a 2015 forum, then-USC athletic director Pat Haden reaffirmed that idea, noting that 19 of the University’s 21 sports were losing an average of about $2 million per year, while football substantially profited. 
But therein lies the problem with the justification for football and basketball coaches’ massive salaries: College athletic departments are not big corporations and therefore should not be driven by profit. 
Athletic departments are institutions tasked with promoting intangible qualities, such as sportsmanship and the pursuit of excellence. They weren’t built for the sole pursuit of profit, and if they were, the majority of college sports that lose money every year would have been cut a long time ago.
The virtues of college sports — among them fairness and equality — dictate that in the wake of athletic departments’ current financial distress, smaller sports should be saved at the expense of football and basketball coaches’ massive salaries, not vice versa. The fact that athletic departments around the country are considering such trade-offs — weighing entire sports programs and sets of administrative staff against the salaries of an elite few —  suggests that many coaches’ bloated salaries shouldn’t exist in college sports to begin with.
The effects of the coronavirus are widely expected to persist beyond the 2019-20 academic year. Even assuming football season commences as scheduled in late August — which is far from a certainty at this point — the prospect of fans being unable to afford tickets or avoiding packed 50,000-plus-seat stadiums has many athletic directors bracing for further losses. Per a survey conducted by Lead1 (an association of 130 college athletic directors), 63% of universities expect their department’s revenue to drop by at least 20 percentage points during the 2020-21 academic year.
The economic upheaval ahead will likely upend college athletic departments around the country. Let’s hope that football and basketball coaches’ outsized salaries are the primary casualties.
