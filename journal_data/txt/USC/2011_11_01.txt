As the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences evolves its image, academic content and administration, its leadership is reaching out to students and constituents more often, Executive Vice Provost Michael Quick said.
The school held a forum Tuesday to ask students what they wanted the search committee to look for in a new dean, as current Dean Howard Gillman will step down at the end of the year. Earlier in the semester, USC Dornsife College held forums on how the school should rebrand itself in light of the $200-million donation.

Quick said student forums are integral because many internal discussions spring from issues students bring up.
“The undergraduates had good suggestions about how to better position the university relative to the role in the community,” Quick said.  “They had a lot of input on GE’s and how to think about general education as a part of preparing students for the 21st century. Our internal discussions have been based on that, thinking about those kinds of issues.”
Some students said they are skeptical about how much administration values their input.  Hayley Sherman, a sophomore majoring in international relations said it is difficult for students to know what qualities the new dean should have.
“I don’t really know what a dean does,” Sherman said. “I don’t know if students have the time or interest to go to forums so maybe that’s not the best option.”
Despite student hesitations, Quick said administration is looking to understand the qualities and characteristics students’ value and want to see in the school’s leadership.
“Maybe an undergraduate doesn’t have the full idea of what a dean even is.” Quick said.  “I don’t think you need to know the whole job description to have an opinion on what kind of person the dean should be.”
Some students said they are thankful that administration cares enough to ask.
“It is really interesting that my role within the college is not lost among the many students,” said Alexa Pace, a junior majoring in psychology.  “This shows that they care about individual students.”

USC Libraries is providing more electronic resources, and changing the way it serves students in response to the rising popularity of e-books, administrators said.
Bookworm · USC Libraries are expanding its collection of electronic material in response to students’ increased usage of e-books and online journals and databases. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
A recent study by the Library Journal and School Library Journal said academic institutions increased the number of e-books available to users by an average of 93 percent.
USC libraries said they currently have 470,000 e-books available online and will continue to increase the number available according to student demand.
Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC Libraries, said the university’s libraries are committed to evolving in the Internet age, and will be proactive in ensuring that students continue to receive the best resources, whether online or in print.
“It is not so much a change, but an evolution that is not going to stop,” McHarg said. “Not everything is available online, so the question lies in providing the best content in the best situation.”
Many students access academic resources online through the USC Library Catalogue of online journals and e-books. This digital collection alters the way students utilize USC Libraries because students can access the research sources online instead of going into the library to check out books.
The Library Journal study also found 43 percent of academic libraries reported an increase in the number of e-book requests.
Though e-book usage is increasing, USC Libraries administration said the need for in-person attention and physical resources remains just as important to students.
USC Libraries Dean Catherine Quinlan said students should consider the benefits and drawbacks of deciding whether to use e-books or printed texts.
“There are many benefits [to using e-books] such as easy access — anywhere, anytime,” Quinlan said. “However, there are drawbacks. There is not always an e-books copy of a printed book, and students have to be careful when using e-books because they may not be digitized correctly.”
Many students said they use e-books as their first choice, using physical copies at USC libraries less and less for finding research resources.
Mika Lee, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said e-books are more convenient and this changes the way students view information for class.
“I try to use e-books as much as I can. I don’t want to deal with going to the library and returning books,” Lee said. “Although [e-books] may decrease the importance of physical books … [they are a] lot more convenient … and really helpful to have at USC.”
Vanessa Haddad, a senior majoring in communication, said the role of libraries has changed for her generation.
“The new library of this age [is the] online library. … There are less and less reasons to go inside,” Haddad said. “The USC online library also has a service where you can chat online with a librarian to help you search, which really helps.”
Other students said they still prefer to search for books in the library to assure the credibility of sources first hand.
Hal Wright, a sophomore majoring in economics, said physical books are easier to use for research.
“I like to see the actual book in person,” Wright said. “I feel like sometimes you can get lost online with searching [because there is] so much there. When you go to a library, it has credibility and you can see if sources look like they are well put together and ask a librarian’s advice.”
USC Libraries said it will continue to grow its online resources but will focus on teaching students how to adapt to the changing times.
“Our job is now to teach students how to be critical consumers of information and evaluate sources critically in order to use them appropriately,” Quinlan said.
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of e-books available online through USC Libraries t0 be 47,000.  There are 470,000, according to Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC Libraries.
Just wanted to say there are privacy issues with regards to ebooks, especially if you are using Amazon.  I hope the library explains the issues to their patrons.
Hello, everyone.
I just want to note a correction. The USC Libraries currently make available over 470,000 e-books, rather than the 47,000 indicated in the article.
Thanks for giving attention to this important issue for libraries and our community at USC.

Students reacted positively Tuesday to the new “We are Considerate. We are USC” campaign, saying issues surrounding bikes need to be directly addressed.
The new campaign “We are Considerate. We are USC” calls for Trojans to generally be more considerate, with a current focus on bike-related problems around campus.

The school introduced the campaign to the USC community through a mass email, a full-page advertisement in the Daily Trojan and a banner in front of Alumni Park. The signs on Trousdale Parkway noting the area where bikes must be walked during peak hours were replaced with larger signs bearing the “We are Considerate” logo and goals.
Some students said they are glad the administration is working to address the issue.
“USC needs to work it out because there is no getting rid of bikes,” said Andrew Chen, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “All in all, I’m glad they’re trying to actually do something about the problem.”
Jasmine Wasserman, a sophomore majoring in communication, said changes in biker behavior have to come from individuals.
“People have to be more careful,” Wasserman said. “Bikers are usually doing four things at once — it’s kind of scary.”
Simon Moshkovich, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business), said the increased enforcement of walk-your-bike zones will encourage students to follow rules.
“I know I [walk my bike] when I see security around,” Moshkovich said. “The school looks like it’s taking a step in the right direction. It’s all you can hope for.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi said he was happy with the launch.
“We definitely made a strong presence on campus,” Tyagi said. “I haven’t had enough time to gauge detailed student reaction, but in general, it definitely got people’s attention.”
Tyagi said students he spoke to did not seem to completely understand the purpose of the campaign, but he feels that campaign awareness is the most important thing at this time.
“Some people don’t immediately associate it with the bike and traffic issues on campus,” Tyagi said. “Hopefully it will grab people’s attention so they will understand more about the message behind the campaign and being considerate by biking safely.”
Several students said they encountered many problems related to the large number of bicycles on campus.
Liz Soriano, a sophomore majoring in communication, said bicyclists’ behavior endangers pedestrians.
“There are these small spaces people try to ride their bikes through and I got hit by a passing [bike] the other day,” Soriano said. “It hurt pretty bad and it must have looked bad, because the guy behind him offered to chase the [bicyclist that hit me].”
Students said they also want to see security issues addressed. Neil Tamashiro-Miyamoto, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, recently had two bikes stolen in less than two weeks.
“Bike theft is just as big a problem as accidents, if not bigger,” Tamashiro-Miyamoto said.
Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a junior majoring in political science who works at the reception desk in Leavey Library, said parking issues should also be addressed.
“We’ve had instances where [the Dept. of Public Safety] has come in to tell us they needed to confiscate bikes that were parked on the handicap rails,” Golin-Blaugrund said. “DPS should have the power to do what they need to because that sort of thing is just wrong.”

On July 1, the day the Pac-10 officially became the Pac-12, the change seemed like a great idea.
Commissioner Larry Scott welcomed new members Colorado and Utah, saying the two schools “instantly enhance the strength of our conference both academically and athletically.”
The additions helped Scott secure a 12-year, $3-billion television deal with ESPN and Fox, creating a national Pac-12 network that would greatly increase exposure of member schools’ athletic programs.
Four months later, the Buffs and Utes are a combined 1-9 in Pac-12 play, and with schools like Texas A&M, TCU and Boise State switching conferences, Scott’s expansion choices are looking more short-sighted by the day.
To be fair, Utah couldn’t have been expected to struggle this mightily. The Utes had won at least 10 games in each of the last three seasons, including a 13-0 mark in 2008 capped off by a 31-17 Sugar Bowl win over Alabama.
A season-ending injury to quarterback Jordan Wynn and a banged-up receiving corps have caused Utah’s passing game, ranked 100th in the nation, to suffer. Its next four opponents have a combined record of 10-23, which means the Utes could still qualify for a decent bowl game.
Colorado’s results have been more in line with the program’s recent history. The Buffaloes haven’t won more than seven games in a season since 2005, finished the season ranked since 2002 or won a bowl game since 2004. Colorado went a combined 6-18 in its final three seasons in the Big 12.
For many traveling USC fans, Friday night’s game against the 1-8 Buffaloes is not a must-see matchup, but rather a convenient excuse to take a weekend ski trip to the Rocky Mountains.
Colorado has lost its last four games by 41, 28, 43 and 34 points. The Buffaloes only win came at home back in September against now 3-5 Colorado State.
The Buffaloes rank last in the Pac-12 in scoring offense, rushing offense, red zone offense, scoring defense, rushing defense, passing defense efficiency, red zone defense, sacks against, opponents’ first downs, interceptions and kickoff returns.
In short, this is one bad football team.
The newcomers’ struggles haven’t been contained to the gridiron either.
Colorado’s women’s volleyball team is 0-15 in Pac-12 play. The Buffaloes have won only three sets in conference play this season. Utah, meanwhile, has posted a 4-11 record, good for 10th place in the Pac-12.
Utah sits in sixth place in the conference in women’s soccer, while 1-8-1 Colorado is in 11th.
The Pac-12 preseason basketball polls predict Colorado to finish 10th on the men’s side and 11th on the women’s. The Utah women’s team is slated to finish a respectable sixth, but the men have been picked to finish dead last in the conference.
The Buffaloes did just sweep the men’s and women’s cross country championships last week, but for the self-titled “Conference of Champions,” surely a school has to do more than dominate long-distance running to earn admission.
Though the Pac-12 hasn’t dominated the modern football landscape like the SEC or stacked up to the ACC and Big East on the basketball court recently, the conference stands out nationally for the all-around strength of its athletic programs.
The Pac-12 has led all conferences in national titles in 45 of the past 51 years and its 442 all-time national championships are nearly 200 more than its closest competitor.
Just last season alone, the conference won national titles in men’s tennis and men’s water polo (USC), men’s and women’s swimming (California), women’s water polo and men’s gymnastics (Stanford), women’s indoor track and field (Oregon), softball (Arizona State), and women’s golf (UCLA).
Things could still turn around for Colorado and Utah. The schools have combined for 42 NCAA national titles in their history.
From 2001 to 2005, Colorado’s football team played in four Big 12 championship games. They finished their season ranked in the top five nationally four times between 1989 and 1994, including when they split the national title with Georgia Tech in 1990.
Utah’s men’s basketball team won the Mountain West title in 2009 and has a history of success. They finished in the top 10 nationally from 1997 to 1999, including a trip to the national title game in 1998.
Their membership in the Pac-12 alone, along with the increase in television revenue and prestige that go along with it, will help both schools in recruiting top athletes.
First impressions are powerful and the Utes and Buffaloes have done little so far to win over critics.
The “we need time to adjust to a higher level of competition” excuses won’t fly for long.
If Colorado and Utah don’t get it together soon, Scott will have some serious explaining to do. A combined record of 1-9 is not going to cut it in the Conference of Champions.

The No. 1 USC men’s tennis team has already laid claim to two individual singles titles this year. Now USC coach Peter Smith hopes that one of the team’s younger players can capture another one as the fall tournament season nears its end.
Five USC underclassmen will have that chance as they travel to the 55th Southern California Intercollegiate Championships at the Los Angeles Tennis Center in Westwood, which begins today.

Sophomore No. 66 Emilio Gomez and freshmen Eric Johnson, Jonny Wang and Yannick Hanfmann will represent the Trojans in a 32-player singles main draw beginning Thursday, while sophomore Corey Smith will begin the competition in the singles qualifying draw today.
“I’d love to see one of them win this UCLA tournament,” Smith said. “Of all the tournaments we’ve played, winning a majority of those would be special.”
Following a run to the semifinals of the International Tennis Association Southwest Regionals in Malibu two weeks ago, Hanfmann holds the No. 1 seed in the competition. Gomez stands on the opposite side of the bracket with the No. 2 seed.
The players look to follow up the success of USC alumnus Jaak Poldma, who captured the singles title at the five-day competition last year.
Gomez boasts a 10-1 record in preseason singles along with a singles title from the Battle in the Bay Classic in San Francisco in October. He hopes to bounce back after his first loss in the round of 16 at the ITA Southwest Regionals.
“I’ve been practicing a lot with coaches, and I think we’ve been improving a lot the past couple of weeks,” Gomez said.
USC will also send two pairs to play in the doubles draw. Gomez and Hanfmann hold the tournament’s No. 1 seed, while Johnson and Wang will pair up together in the 16-team bracket.
“We played doubles a few times during [the Harvard Invitational], and we played pretty well,” Gomez said.
Along with Gomez’s success in the fall, the freshman trio of Hanfmann, Johnson and Wang has also shown its capability throughout multiple tournaments this year, and the rest of the team has noted the newcomers’ efforts.
“They’ve done a lot and done well at regionals,” senior Daniel Nguyen said. “I think they’re definitely maturing more and getting used to college tennis.”
With the younger core of USC men’s tennis attaining experience and success early in fall tournaments, the coaching staff believes the team has a lot of promise to succeed once the spring season begins.
“The team knows we got to keep working, and we got a long way to go,” Smith said. “But we have a great team, so I’d just love to see these guys have individual glory in the fall.”

No. 21 USC looks to rebound from a triple-overtime loss to Stanford as it prepares to travel to Boulder, Colo., to face Colorado, marking the teams’ first meeting since 2002. It also marks the first meeting between the two schools since the formation of the Pac-12.

Though the Buffaloes are winless in Pac-12 play, USC coach Lane Kiffin has told the team not to overlook its opponent.
“Colorado has played well at home and have done that for years,” Kiffin said. “[Its] blowouts, with the exception of Oregon, have been on the road.”
With the possibility of snow and inclement weather during the game, the Trojans aim to not let the forecast affect their mindset as they head into Friday’s game.
“Everyone will probably be in long sleeves but besides that, you can’t think about it,” junior defensive end Devon Kennard said. “If you don’t make it a factor, it won’t be a factor.”
Coming off a loss, junior quarterback Matt Barkley said USC should be ready.
“I think it will be an opportunity for us to dominate rather than just coast through,” Barkley said.

After a standout game against Stanford, junior tailback Curtis McNeal is looking for a repeat performance against Colorado. McNeal admitted his fumble in the third overtime offset his strong play earlier in Saturday’s game.
“It took a lot away from me,“ McNeal said. “It just really hit me hard because we played our hearts out in that game.”
Barkley said he has told McNeal to remain positive and focus on the game ahead.
“I know what’s going through his head,” Barkley said. “Right now, he is the best back we have and I have told him that [he] can’t pin [the loss] on [himself].”

Kiffin noted the team’s improvement of the defense and the team as a whole since the beginning of the season, especially in its last two contests against Notre Dame and Stanford. The Irish were limited to just 41 rushing yards and 2.9 yards per carry. The Cardinal, meanwhile, was limited to 3.9 yards per carry after coming in to the game averaging over five yards per carry. Though Stanford put up 56 points, the Trojans managed to sack Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck twice and sophomore Nickell Robey picked off the top Heisman candidate for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter.
“I think the impact of Nickell [Robey] playing well has been a big part of our improvement on defense,” Kiffin said. “He’s playing at a really high level, which is great to see from a kid that is only a true sophomore.”
—
Injuries have increased for the Trojans in recent weeks. Kiffin announced redshirt junior defensive end Wes Horton, redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris, redshirt freshman linebacker Dion Bailey, freshman tailback George Farmer, senior tailback Marc Tyler and senior fullback Rhett Ellison did not practice.
Junior safety Jawanza Starling was limited in practice. Kiffin does not believe that Tyler will play on Friday.
—
Kiffin announced that redshirt junior safety Drew McAllister will be starting in place of junior safety T.J. McDonald during the first half against Colorado. McDonald is serving a first-half suspension after incurring a penalty for unnecessary roughness in last week’s game.
“[McAllister] has practiced really well and has more interceptions than anyone else in our practices,” Kiffin said. “It will be a great opportunity for him to step up.”
McDonald was penalized for targeting for the fourth time this season, with three coming against Arizona State in late September.
“I accept the penalty and I apologize to my team, Stanford’s team and to our fans,” McDonald said. “I’m going to figure out a way for this to not happen in the future.”
McDonald said he believes his first-half suspension is fair because he has been penalized before for harsh hits.
Kiffin was also fined $10,000 after publicly criticizing the officiating after Saturday’s game.
“I am sorry that all this happened and I have learned from this,“ Kiffin said. “Regardless of questions, I can’t answer anything that has to do with a call during a game or any conversation that an official has with me.”
Both Coach Kiffin and TJ are reacting to these penalties like good stand up guys but what Scott did to both of them was bogus and political BS. The SEC Commissioner would have NEVER done this to a LSU or Alabama player because thats just good football. What was the 15 yd penalty for in the game?
Good thing Taylor Mays isn’t still playing college with Scott as our Commish. or May’s have to get a lawn chair for the sidelines.
I’ll also assume Larry Scott has never watched a ASU game with Burfict in it for the last 2.5 seasons. What a joke.
I hope the team sees this for what it is aganist USC and trying to keep them down from “effecting” The BCS or PAC 12 title game and make it their mission to lay wood on every damn team remaining on their sched. starting with Colorado this Friday night.
Washington especially needs a beating of their life from us.
Word to McNeil , do not pin this loss on yourself. You were a f’ing stud out there and thousands of Trojan fans are super proud of what you did.  Bad officiating that took away our regulation time to kick our deserved FG is what lost our game, not what any SC player did including you MOST of all…
you are a F’ING BEAST …. ” The Beast McNeil” ..lol..
Note we are now #21 from 20. Thats because the Mighty Cardinal got beat within an inch of their life and went home literally crying about it and giving thanks to their tree god.
Show The NCAA, Scott, and the hayta’s what your made of and pound Colorado this Friday..  We are SC !! Fight On !!

For decades, Nintendo has been one of the most successful video game companies in the world. But in terms of annual revenue, this year is turning out to be one of Nintendo’s worst.
Last Thursday, Nintendo announced its staggering $925 million net loss for the first half of the fiscal year. Its total net loss — the company’s first annual loss in 30 years — is projected to be $264 million.
With a combination of disadvantageous factors, such as underwhelming hardware and software sales, price cuts and an unbalanced exchange rate, Nintendo is facing the consequences of poorly executed business moves.
Is this the end to the company’s impressive legacy?
There’s no denying the enormity of the situation. Nintendo has relied heavily on Japanese clientele, but the Japanese yen has recently appreciated, contributing to losses in international profit, from which Nintendo collects 80 percent of its revenue.
In addition, several financial problems surfaced after the March launch of the Nintendo 3DS system. Last August, in an attempt to increase sales, Nintendo dropped the price of the 3DS from $250 to $170. Though this move might have enticed some customers to purchase the unit, it has done little except contribute to overall revenue loss.
With all of these factors deterring Nintendo’s usual success, it’s difficult not to assume the worst looms around the corner. But Nintendo’s plans prove this market tragedy is not by any means an end to the company’s reign.
First off, to attempt to lessen the impact of this projected net loss, Nintendo hopes to increase sales with two of its most highly anticipated holiday releases for the 3DS. The company expects Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7,  the first original franchise-based games for the 3DS, to re-hook the gaming community and to spark more positive word of mouth, ultimately leading to increased sales of 3DS systems.
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata’s recognition of past mistakes suggests this year’s market loss might not be a complete failure in the end. If anything, this misstep has given Nintendo more incentive to improve the 3DS system’s capabilities.
“The company will aim to develop and launch products that can provide meaningful surprises to the public by taking advantage of the company’s position of being able to make new proposals that integrate both hardware and software, and of its ability to develop products that can be accepted by a wide variety of consumers, irrespective of age, gender or past gaming experience,” Iwata said in a semi-annual financial results briefing with Nintendo on Friday.
Nintendo is hinting at making the 3DS a more mobile device, similar to an iPad or a smart phone.
But can the 3DS really compete on the same terrain?
Judging by the ambitious nature of Nintendo’s plans, the answer is yes.
Since the launch of the Wii in 2006, Nintendo has developed a reputation as a go-to brand for casual gamers. This audience is the same audience that mobile devices, such as the iPad, target with their collection of fun, affordable games available for download.
Nintendo plans to improve its 3DS’ eShop in the near future by adding more downloadable content support as well as a bigger supply of demo versions of downloadable games. The company will also provide recording capability to the 3DS and allow the system to download eShop content while in sleep mode.
In addition, Netflix, which launched as a service for the 3DS in July, has been downloaded on more than 400,000 3DS units.
It’s a bit alarming that it took a market tragedy for Nintendo to realize that big-name, original software is a must-have when launching a gaudy piece of hardware as overpriced as the 3DS. Marketing the 3DS as an alternative to mobile devices is clearly one of the best moves Nintendo can make to redeem itself from this year’s stumble. Though Nintendo will have to accept a disappointing net loss come March, one bad year doesn’t necessarily mean an end to the Roman Empire of gaming. Nintendo has definitely had its share of disappointment, but bouncing back is just one of its many talents.

I think you’re absolutely correct. Nintendo has made some mistakes, but its recent moves are indicative of what’s to come. It’s boldly decided to sacrifice short-term profits for a more optimistic long-term financial outlook, and “we the gamers” are the beneficiaries. 
Nintendo’s been at this for a long, long time. I have no doubts as to its sheer versatility and strength.

Spotted everywhere on style blogs and occasionally on campus, their style provokes envy from other girls and draws a second look from guys: They’re girls who look impeccably unkempt, making a just-rolled-out-of-bed appearance seem put together.
Walking down Melrose Avenue, a haven of vintage stores, it becomes apparent that all of those “cool” girls flock to the same places to put together their one-of-a-kind outfits.
Bargain hunters · On Sundays, shoppers converge on the Jet Rag parking lot, where the store piles items of clothing all sold for $1. - Megan Harmon | Daily Trojan
 
The most highly concentrated stretch of vintage and consignment stores in the city is located on and around Melrose between Fairfax and La Brea avenues. Many of the merchants are synonymous with Los Angeles style culture, having been around for decades. Ranging from shops that sell inexpensive local designer goods to famed retailers that sell gowns for thousands of dollars, there is more treasure hunting to be done in this mile-long stretch than one day allows.
Melrose is the perfect weekend vintage shopping destination. The street is usually filled with locals and tourists, who come to find great style, great food from mainstays like Pink’s Hot Dogs or food trucks parked along the curbs and, on a nice day, to enjoy a sunny stroll.
Any item of clothing made more than 20 years ago is considered vintage, and adding a piece or two of vintage clothing can spice up an entire outfit. It is possible to get a lot of “look” for a small amount of cash if you play the bargain hunting game with the right strategy. Vintage accessories, like a bright belt or turquoise jewelry, can be worn with modern clothing. The most successful vintage shoppers keep a mental picture of what they already own in the back of their minds, then browse the racks for a little addition, be it a vest, shorts or a piece of statement jewelry.
The perfect place to start looking for quality pieces is Jet Rag, a local favorite that feels distinctly West Coast with its rusted signage and wooden steps. Located on La Brea Avenue, just north of Melrose, Jet Rag offers an astonishing selection of boots, bags and button downs generally priced between $10 and $40. Some of the long coats can get a little pricy, but otherwise, Jet Rag’s well-merchandised racks are friendly to even the rookie vintage shopper. Vests in denim and suede are all placed together, as are leather skirts and cross-body bags. Men can choose from hundreds of solid, striped, check or chambray shirts in good condition.
On weekdays, Jet Rag is a serene store and good for browsing, but on Sundays, the store piles goods in the parking lot and prices each item at $1, bringing in waves of fashionable bargain hunters. This is the time to find T-shirts and jeans that can be cut, painted or dyed.
Within walking distance of Jet Rag, crafty inspiration abounds. Los Angeles’ artsy crowd flocks to the coffee shops and stores farther west on Melrose, sporting fedoras, fringe, dark nail polish and breezy hair. For the most part, the shoppers and coffee drinkers have a similar air about them, but it is their style nuances that add individuality.
These shoppers play muse to the photographers and designers who influence the product at mainstream retailers like Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, which occupy large spaces on the stretch of shops on Melrose. The stores’ aesthetics meet the vibe of the area, but after walking through racks of authentic vintage clothing, it is easy to see how the designs of the new clothes are inspired by their older counterparts. Soft, loose knits, leather goods and beaded tops are available at both new and vintage retailers, and the similarities are striking. Buying a new version of any of these pieces might feel cleaner, but the price is a major drawback.
A store whose style Urban Outfitters seems to be mimicking lately is SLOW, a vintage store that focuses on Western-inspired apparel and Native American influences, such as prints, beads and suede.
American Vintage has the same kind of look, but with more of a classic feel reminiscent of the ’70s. Its layout is much like that of Jet Rag’s, with wooden floors and a second-floor balcony. Scouring collections of clothes that date back to your parents’ college days and trying to decide what is relevant today can be stressful. But the experience shouldn’t be focused on analyzing every detail of a purchase. The important part is how you decide to wear it later on. Go with something in mind, but don’t be afraid to stray from the original plan. You never know when inspiration will strike.

The Ark Theatre Company’s new production of The Taming of the Shrew presents a refreshing and bold take on Shakespeare’s classic romantic comedy. Actors perform in modern dress and present a plot that, while still adhering to the original text, has modern undertones.
Contemporary duets · Lucientio (Brad Satterwhite, left) and Bianca (Carolyn Marie Wright) exemplify Wagar’s attempt to modernize a Shakespeare classic. Modern dress and undertones fuel Wagar’s rendition. - Photo courtesy of Philip Sokoloff
In accordance with director Paul Wagar’s conviction that “the play didn’t need adapting, just playing what’s there with different assumptions,” the performance adheres precisely to the original plotline, complete with Shakespearean vernacular.
The Taming of the Shrew explores societal expectations for men and women and uses disguise, deceit and slapstick to embellish the play with color and comedy.
Baptista Manola (Walt Gray) is a wealthy man of Padua with two daughters: the beautiful, mild-mannered Bianca (Carolyn Marie Wright) desired by many men for marriage and the ill-tempered, aggressive Katherine (Sarah Kay Watson).
Much to the chagrin of Bianca’s suitors, Lucentio (Brad Satterwhite) and Gremio (Jared Dagar), Manola will not allow Bianca to marry until Katherine is wed.
The suitors’ woes are alleviated with the arrival of Petruchio (Joe Tower), a brash young man who agrees to marry Katherine and subsequently “tame the shrew out of her.”
Wagar’s rendition features two distinct plotlines: the relationship between Katherine and Petruchio and the game of disguise to decide who will marry Bianca.
After marrying the unwilling and unruly Katherine, Petruchio commences his quest to “tame” her, which he accomplishes by depriving her of food, sleep and clothing.
Though a few details of the intricate plot are lost in Shakespeare’s esoteric vernacular, the play successfully conveys the general story in a comprehensible and clear manner — a difficult feat when reproducing Shakespeare for a modern audience.
At times it is difficult to distinguish certain characters, and the audience’s perception of the play’s setting is obscured. But Wagar’s minimalism emphasizes the underlying themes of the play without relying on elaborate costumes or sets, and it proves to be somewhat refreshing.
Because of Wagar’s direction, the audience is able to appreciate the story’s subject matter and listen to the characters’ voices without feeling disconnected from the material, as is often the case in period pieces.
Unfortunately, Wagar’s tactics don’t redeem every aspect of the play. The plot’s delivery suffers from several of the actors’ stage fright, resulting in dropped lines and performances that come off unnatural and cartoonish.
Though the production suffers from acting nerves, the exploration of the relationship between Kate and Petruchio is timeless and poignant, saving the play from falling into sub-par moments. Their relationship undoubtedly shines as the show-stealer, thanks to supreme performances by Watson and Tower and a unique exploration of Petruchio’s reaction to his “tamed” wife.
Petruchio’s relentless cruelty and undeniable wit coincides with the gradual corrosion of Katherine’s body, mind and spirit, creating a chilling and moving portrayal of the break down of one human at the hands of another, a theme that resounds powerfully and timelessly with any audience.
Katherine reaches her breaking point while traveling back to Padua, when Petruchio forces her to vocally contradict known facts in nature, resulting in a heartbreaking exposure of male dominance.
In the final scene, Katherine presents her famous monologue in which she chides her sister for failing to live up to a wife’s duty as gentle servant to her “loving lord” or husband, proving to her disbelieving friends and family that she has been tamed.
Watson’s words are poignant and unwavering, and her demeanor is so heartfelt and gentle it’s impossible to take your eyes off her.
Perhaps the most defining moment in the play is the unforgettable expression that clouds Petruchio’s face when he embraces his wife after her passionate speech.
Rather than conveying pride at the submissive woman Pertruchio sculpts from a shrew, his face is consumed with shame and guilt. He finally realized that he smothered Katherine’s fire and spirit, the very things that initially made her fascinating.
Tower’s ability to convey this realization with no more than a simple tortured look speaks volumes about his mastery as an actor. The director’s choice to conclude the play with Petruchio’s reaction adds an interesting dimension to the story and further appeals to a modern audience less inclined to accept a story about a woman’s inferiority to her husband.
The Taming of the Shrew runs Nov. 11 through Nov. 20 with performances every Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and every Sunday at 7 p.m. For ticketing, visit www.arktheatre.org.

USC should require flu shot
“I hate needles, it’s going to hurt so bad.” “I don’t need the flu shot; it’s only for the elderly.” “I never get the flu; there’s no need for me to get the flu shot.”
These are all quotes from my roommate, who until last week, when I forced her to go to the health clinic with me to get my annual flu shot, had not received a shot since the first grade. I, on the other hand, am used to getting vaccinations. From the chicken pox, to the meningitis, to the HPV vaccine and to yearly flu shots, I have become immune to being poked with needles.
Should all USC students be required to get the flu shot, or is that simply unnecessary? I am a firm believer in the efficacy of the flu shot and after having a first-hand experience with swine flu nearly two years ago, I hereby advocate for USC to make it mandatory for all students to be vaccinated.
People scared of needles can take a sigh of relief: There is an alternative. The nasal-spray is inhaled through the nose and contains a weakened strain of the live virus found in the flu.
“But I got the flu shot last year!”
As much as we would all like to get one flu shot that lasts a lifetime, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Mayo Clinic, the flu virus evolves so rapidly that last year’s vaccine will not protect you from the strains present in this year’s flu.
“But I can’t afford it.”
This is not a valid excuse anymore, considering for students with USC health insurance, it costs just $2.50 for a flu shot. And for those students with another form of health insurance, it’s only $25. Because USC is covering 90 percent of health care costs for students, we should all take advantage of this and protect ourselves from the flu.  And if $25 seems like too much money, consider the costs you incur when you are diagnosed with some form of influenza and are required to purchase Tamiflu, Advil, etc.
The New York Times said in a health article about pertussis that “people living in dormitories or other crowded conditions” should be vaccinated.  Sure, some students might be commuting and others might live in single dorms, but for the most part, the majority of USC students have at least one roommate, which automatically increases our chances of contracting the flu. By receiving the flu shot, we are not only protecting ourselves, but we are also reducing the chances that our roommates/peers will come down with the flu.
USC already requires proof of a variety of other vaccinations and mandates that all international students provide documentation of a tuberculosis test prior to enrollment. What is one more shot, and one that could ultimately protect tens of thousands of students, teachers and faculty members?

Can we just walk into the health clinic on campus, slap down 2 dollars and couple quarters, and pick up the nasal spray?

The walk to class every day is surprisingly tricky. Anyone who has walked on campus knows to be aware of the multitude of wheeled vehicles that weave precariously among pedestrians in a frenzied mesh of near-collisions and last-gasp rushes for the start of class.
USC has had a longstanding bike problem, and the few changes done to try to fix it have not really worked. USC’s new initiative called “We are Considerate. We are USC.” sets out to tackle this issue in a new and tactical way.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
 
USC will partner with a consulting firm to count bicycles and take aerial shots in an attempt to record and assess the behavior of bike traffic on campus while employing new strategies to ultimately change the bike culture on campus.
This kind of clear-thinking approach signals one important thing: USC has identified a problem directly affecting students and is attacking it head-on in a productive way.
Attempts to curb heavy bike traffic have included the installation of bike-free pedestrian safety zones, in addition to tighter restrictions on bike registration and parking.
These attempts did not meet the full expectations of students as the policies proved difficult to enforce and failed to address the overall issue directly. Banning bikes in the central areas on campus seems to be attacking the problem at its core.
But it seems to cause heavier bike traffic in the areas outside the zones, and to increase possibility of accidents whenever someone tries to ride through these zones — either forgetting or ignoring the rule.
These policies seem to be an indirect way of addressing the real problem: the number of bikes on campus.
Banning bikes through main junctures of foot traffic could never be enforced fully, and the university rightfully backed away from the hard-line policy.
By hiring an outside consultant, USC shows it is willing to accept help in a problem that has become clear the university is not sure how to handle.
The move inspires confidence in the leadership abilities of our current administrators and student government.
Instead of stubbornly maintaining its previous decisions, the university is showing it will continue to search for solutions until an efficient solution emerges.
By gathering data, the consulting firm will have the ability to form a good plan of attack.
By taking aerial photos from around the school and collecting bicycle traffic totals, the firm helps the university form an accurate model of bicycle traffic during the day. They will also apply lessons learned from other traffic situations that have been managed.
In a city like Los Angeles, which continues to struggle with a traffic problem, it seems fitting that a bicycle problem would emerge in the same vein.
Obviously, the jury is still waiting to see what the consultants will come up with. But the fact that USC accepted help in such an innovative way shows that the university is truly committed to solving the problems. This bodes well for the resolution of the bike problem and other dilemmas we might choose to tackle in the future, as opposed to the administration merely taking the problem upon itself.
 
Daniel Grzywacz is a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts-critical studies. His column “Thoughts From the Quad” runs Wednesdays. 
Only at USC would “too many bikes” be considered a “problem”. In car dominated Los Angeles, it only makes sense that your institution would try and limit the number the of students actively trying to get to class on time, while engaging in semi-athletic behavior. 
Why not take a cue from Stanford, which I know may be hard, and actually promote bike use by installing bike racks out side buildings and designating areas where bikes and pedestrians and interact safely??
Better yet, why not read the editorial below from another ‘Daily’ newspaper. You just may learn something….
http://www.stanforddaily.com/2011/04/22/editorial-biking-at-stanford-how-to-keep-leading-the-pack/
You claim this is a “clear thinking” and “progressive” approach, while failing to see or at least acknowledge a huge assumption. You state the the “problem” is the “number of bikes on campus”. While it may be a problem that bikes and pedestrians are not currenlty mixing well (though I wonder if there is anything real to back that up), you fail to consider that this could indicate a problem beyond the number or behavior or cyclists.
If large numbers of students are riding bikes on campus, there is a reason. It is a safe, quick, convenient, and inexpensive way for students to navigate a large campus and larger neighborhood. By discouraging students, faculty, and staff from cycling, you are instead encouraging them to use cars which have a large number of space and safety problems, shuttle services which are not convenient or adequate, or walk which is not often quick enough to navigate this large area.
When bike and pedestrian interactions are not going well, this is usually an indication of poorly designed roadways and paths rather than a problem with the number or “culture” of cyclists. Simple and cheap fixes could improve how cyclists navigate the campus and neighborhood. Identify key routes and mark them for bikes. Integrate on campus bike routes with neighborhood bike and transit infrastructure. Limit areas banned to bikes to only those small regions where distances are short and pedestrian presence is especially heavy.
Especially with the opening of the Expo Metro line, the number of USC students and staff using bikes to get to, from, and around campus is only going to increase. This should be encouraged, not portrayed as a “problem”.
USC simply needs paved bike paths throughout campus similar to University of California at Irvine. If you give bicycles a proper place to ride, most will use it.

Stella Artois is wishing you a Happy Belated Halloween by giving you a free Christmas album. But really, who’s complaining?
Log on to Stella’s website and you can grab a brand new collection of Christmas tunes inspired by Stella Artois’ 2010 “Originally Crafted for Christmas” commercial.
The inspirational commercial followed an ice carving competition in which competing entries were an ice piano and an ice living area complete with Stella Artois. Can you guess which one? 
The fan favorite aspect of the ad was the French version of the “12 Days of Christmas,” which had a cozy, jazz feel. The brand offered the song, “Les 12 Jours de Noel” as a free download to consumers last year, but it’s stepping up the game this time around with a full EP for dedicated fans.
Stella Artois and its marketing department released a statement saying that the album was recorded in 1960s fashion, including the usage of vintage sound equipment. The oldies feel is even translated through the album artwork.
“Under The Holiday Star” will be available through the month of November. Think of it as a late Halloween trick-or-treat and an early Christmas present all wrapped in one. The first song that will be up for download is the album’s first single, “The Nutcracker March.”

Bank of America announced Tuesday that it was dropping its plan to install a $5 monthly fee for using its debit cards after a month of outcry from customers.
The backlash after BofA said in September it would start charging debit card holders the new fee included pledges to cancel accounts and move to credit unions. Protesters have encouraged bank holders to participate in “Bank Transfer Day” this Saturday and close their bank accounts at large corporations.
Many account holders perceived it was unfair that BofA was proposing a fee to access their own money — as opposed to credit card accounts.
“I’m unemployed and $5 makes a big difference,” Diane Abela, who learned of the bank’s reversal just before heading into a job interview, told WBSTV. “When you’re working on a budget every week, it’s the last thing you need.”
Larger banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo had said they would not follow BofA’s suit after the banks saw the consumer reaction to additional fees.
“For a lot of consumers, this was the last straw,” Jean Ann Fox, director of financial services for the Washington- based Consumer Federation of America, told Bloomberg News.
BofA had originally said stricter regulation and limits on other revenue sources had forced it to consider the debit card account fee. Last month, the federal government cut the amount of money that banks could earn from debit card purchase fees.
The bank’s backtracking reflects movie giant Netflix after it decided to forego its separate DVD-by-mail program, which would have been an additional cost for consumers. Netflix is estimated to have lost about 800,000 subscribers since the announced plan.

In the inaugural Jack Kramer Invitational played this past weekend in Palos Verdes, Calif., two Women of Troy gained valuable experience that could pay off as the season progresses.
Sophomore Kaitlyn Christian, who enjoyed much of her success playing doubles thus far, advanced to the semifinals, while junior Valeria Pulido played in her first collegiate match of the year after playing for Mexico in the Pan American Games.
Christian, who came into the tournament ranked No. 60 in the country in singles, was the No. 3 seed in the draw.  She defeated Ekaterina Iakovieva of Mississippi State in straight sets in her first match, then took down Carling Seguso of UCLA in the quarterfinals in straight sets as well.  Pulido fell in the round of 16 at the hands of Khunpak Issara of Pepperdine.
In the semifinals, Christian squared off against another Bruin, this time the No. 2 seed and No. 45 Pamela Montez.  The match was a thriller, with Christian winning the first set 6-3 before dropping the second set 4-6.  In a decisive 10-point tiebreaker, Montez prevailed by a score of 10-4.
Christian and Pulido will have little time to recover, as the Women of Troy play next weekend, starting Nov. 3 ,at the ITA National Indoor Championships at Flushing Meadows, NY.

The USC Pertusati Bookstore reported Friday that it had the largest number of iPad sales across college campuses nationwide with sales reaching an all-time high of $12 million last year.
Director of USC Bookstores Dan Archer attributes the increased tablet computer sales to Apple’s release of the iPad 2 last March.
“Sales of other tablets are miniscule,” Archer said. “Apple products are a majority of everything sold [at USC]. This has always been an Apple campus, even going back in the ‘90s.”
Students are using tablets in the classroom and for fun, Archer said.
“Tablets are such a convenient tool to use,” Archer said. “You can pull up stats while watching sports, surf the web or take notes in class.”
Lillian But, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said tablet computers’ note-taking capabilities are particularly helpful for college students.
“Tablets are great because they allow you to write directly on the screen,” But said. “I see students drawing graphs on their iPads during science lectures.”
The Marshall School of Business also found that handwritten notes are a more convenient method than notes taken on tablets, according to Archer.
“The Marshall School of Business found that the iPad was cumbersome in the classroom because lecturers talked too quickly for students to take notes on tablets,” Archer said.
According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center’s Excellence in Journalism project, 11 percent of American adults now own some form of a tablet computer. Of these tablet owners, 77 percent reports using the technology on a daily basis, spending an average of 90 minutes per day on them.
ZDNet, a business technology website, also conducted a survey that revealed 16 percent of mobile customers have purchased a tablet computer and another 41 percent plan to buy a tablet in the next 12 months.
The increase in tablet sales also comes at a time when eBook availability has risen. Though few textbooks are available electronically, other types of books on syllabuses are often available online.
“Many eBooks are now available for course material,” Archer said. “EBook sales are still small in comparison to overall course material sales, but inevitably course material is going to go in the direction of eBooks.”
Nicholas Kosturos, a freshman majoring in political science, said he tries to download as many eBooks as he can for his classes.
“Not only are eBooks cheaper, but using eBooks is also more convenient and more green,” Kosturos said. “An eBook gives you way more tools, like the dictionary, and it can be downloaded on any device you own.”
Still, some students prefer physical copies of books, even when electronic ones are available. Vincci Lau, a freshman majoring in international relations, said she prefers using tangible rather than electronic course material.
“Not having an actual book in my hands takes away the authenticity of the reading experience,” Lau said.
Archer said tablets illustrate how technology is revolutionizing the sharing of information in an academic and personal setting.
“The streamline use of technology to disseminate info will keep being used, but the device itself will forever be changing,” Archer said. “Tablets are all over the place right now, but something else will pop up.”

USC organizations held trick-or-treating events Monday to provide families in the surrounding community with a safe environment to celebrate Halloween.
Spooky · More than 1,500 children and parents from the community participated in USC Safe Halloween at the Hoover Recreation Center. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
According to a LivingSocial survey this week, one in five parents said their city is not safe for trick-or-treating and nearly two-thirds of parents said they check their kids’ candy for tampering.
A variety of organizations affiliated with the university host Halloween events each year to ease this concern in the surrounding community. USC organizations hold events for local children to trick-or-treat in a safe, controlled environment.
Each year, sororities and fraternities on The Row pass out candy to children in the surrounding community. Kappa Alpha Theta sorority President Emily Barth said about 12 of her sisters passed out candy to children Monday.
“We hope to contribute to the community so kids can have a safe environment to participate in Halloween,” Barth said. “We want to make sure that they see The Row as a safe place and want to support them, so the community feels comfortable with the Greek community at USC and we can establish further relations with them.”
Several groups also joined the University Residential Student Community to help put on the Halloween carnival “Spirits at Troy” in McCarthy Quad on Monday.
USC Interaxon, the Marshall Women’s Leadership Board, Mortar Board honor society, USC Circle K and representatives from the Panhellenic Council helped run programs at the event.
The Dept. of Public Safety, which had officers monitoring the safety of the event, also passed out candy.
URSC Community Outreach Coordinator Lindsey Estes said the carnival’s location and regular occurance reassure parents of its safety.
“It’s in an enclosed environment, so parents know it’s controlled,” Estes said. “The event has also been going on for a while, so parents know they can trust us to keep their kids safe.”
URSC advertised the event at elementary schools in the USC family in the weeks before the event and Estes said more than 500 children participated.
“We have so many resources at USC and so many opportunities to give back to our community,” Estes said. “Events like these give students an opportunity to give back to the community, where we are able to provide a safe and fun environment.”
This year’s “Spirits at Troy” featured a haunted house in the Marks Tower lobby, bouncy houses, carnival games and face-painting.
The USC Norman Topping Student Aid Fund also hosted a Halloween event Monday. It collaborated with the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks to host more than 1,500 neighborhood children and parents at the USC Safe Halloween celebration at the Hoover Recreation Center.
Topping Scholars helped plan and run Safe Halloween, which included a haunted house, inflatable games, craft booths, costume contests with prizes, a DJ and candy and treats.

International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 11, a union representing electrical workers in the Los Angeles area, increased its picketing efforts Monday on Jefferson Boulevard near the construction site of the new Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann Student Health Center in response to the USC administration’s decision to employ Bergelectric Corp for construction projects on campus.

IBEW Local Union 11 is accusing Bergelectric, a Los Angeles-based electric contracting company, of not meeting Los Angeles County’s worker health benefit standards.
The objective of the picketing is to convince USC to pressure Bergelectric into providing appropriate benefits for its workers, according to Kevin Norton, organizing director and political coordinator for IBEW Local 11.
“We [want] to have people out here making good wages and having proper benefits.” Norton said. “We want them to meet area standards like medical insurance for families, while not undermining our ability to have good construction.”
Norton said the union will continue to protest until Bergelectric changes its policies.
“[Bergelectric] aware of our feelings toward them, and until they meet standards, we are not going to stop protesting,” Norton said.
The university is uses Bergelectric for construction projects because of the competitiveness of the electrical company’s contract bid, according to Kristina Raspe, vice president for USC real estate development and asset management.
“Several IBEW-affiliated contractors submitted bids that were not as competitive as the non-union bidder, and as a result, the non-union electrical subcontract bidder, Bergelectric, won the contract,” Raspe said in an email. “USC continues to enjoy long-standing and strong relationships with the construction unions in the city, and looks forward to working with them extensively on future projects.”
While I find the lack of specific data in the article disappointing, I find it more disturbing that there appears to be an argument between what one user noted as “obvious Bergelectric employees” and what I’ll term as “obvious union supporters” with no supporting data.  Why aren’t both sides providing the wage and benefit data they are debating?  This debate will end quickly if we could just see the facts!
The bottom-line is when companies, like Bergelectric Corp, push down wages and do not offer healthcare benefits, we the taxpayers pay the price. We then have to subsidize a health care system for the thousands of Angelenos that do not have access to health care. USC is not a stand-alone institution. It is located in one of the neighborhoods that has been hardest hit by this recession. It is your responsibility, Ms. Raspe to ensure that USC not only has a good, quality construction project but that those people working on the project get paid fair wages and healthcare benefits.
Again, where is the evidence?????
Apparently what you fail to understand is Berg does provide healthcare benefits. Try and do a little research like possibly visiting their website? Or you could use the IBEW’s strategy and talk nonsense with no accountability.
It is disappointing Ms. Raspe did not specify why Bergelectric’s bid was more “competitive” than IBEW-affiliated contractors. Was it simply because the bid was lower? Typically those who get short-changed by these lower bids are workers, who are not properly paid the wages and benefits they deserve.
This is not the first time Bergelectric has been accused of not being a responsible contractor. USC should make sure that they are not getting “more bang for their buck” at the expense of workers’ safety and livelihood for future contracts.
I assume you’re also disappointed in the lack of specificity regarding the allegations made against Bergelectric?  I’d be interested to know specifically what the IBEW wants to change at Bergelectric.  Does Bergelectric have a poor safety record?  Are they known for abusing workers?
Since IBEW seems to be tossing out accusations with no evidence why not I give it a shot!?
Maybe just maybe, the union contractors are losing their bids by the amount added to labor rates due to UNION DUES?! What added value does this add to the Owner? Apparently it helps pay for picketers and bad press for USC. Hardly what an Owner would be willing to shell out more money for.
This is not a union non-union issue. Companies like Bergelectric hire electricians from out of state who are willing to work for less than area standard wages. These workers send most of their money back home to places like Texas and Arizona.
Its sad that Berg electric doesnt pay the area standard wage and benefits. They are just like Wall Street and the large Corporations who take adavantage of the middle class and erode our way of life.
Shame on you Berg….
Shame on your for not doing your homework.  Marc Greenfield is right.  This isn’t a Union/Non-Union issue.  It’s a fact / fiction issue.  Let’s see the facts.  Nowhere in any of these posts nor in the artcle itself does anyone identify how Bergelectric doesn’t pay the area standard in wages, benefits, etc.  If it’s true, shouldn’t the facts speak for themselves?  It would seem to me that a simple illustration of what the area standards are and how Bergelectric is below them is in order.
We do not argue that Bergelectric Corp. is a not good employer to some of their employees, upper management, superintendents, foreman and long term employees. We want Bergelectric Corp to be a good employer to all of their employees, on all projects they perform work on. Construction work has been a solid middle class job for decades and companies like Bergelectric Corp undermine the Area Standards that have been built up over the last one hundred years in the construction industry. We salute Kristy Pike for giving a more balanced story than the 5 obvious Bergelectric Corp. employees that commented anonymously have given her credit for.
I’m curious where I can find the data supporting the argument that companies like Bergelectric pay lower than the “Area Standards” and I’m even more curious why no one has been willing to show this imperically.  I’m also wondering why “Area Standards” should mean anything in a capitalist economy.  We’re not talking about worker abuse in the industrial revolution spawning unions to grant workers rights, we’re talking about employment.  Why shouldn’t I have the right to work for a lower wage than someone in a union?  Isn’t that my choice?  Isn’t it my right as an American?  The capitalist model is built on innovation, efficiency, and consumer choice.  When we eliminate that choice and unions drive employment, we lose as Americans.  Look at our auto industry as a harbinger of what’s to come in construction if we accept these arguments without facts.
Kevin, you are a typical union mudslinger ( I mean Politician ). You are not interested in anyone
but yourself. Or haven’t you noticed the only people playing the cry wolf game are union.
If you were a good leader you would whip your  local into shape. Talk is cheap and so is the work i’ve seen from some of your members ( I mean electricians ). I to this day have not met a union
electrician that could do it all….and thats where you guys are lacking. bullies never win.
by the way nice try with the Certification Test.  Whats next  “having to prove that you own a pair or two of Carharts” even if, that is not the way you find out what someone knows.  Not to mention with how looted your coffers are shouldn’t you be drumming up business instead of harrassing those who do?
Let me get this straight . . . so you want Berg a non-union  shop to be a good employer to all of their employees? You do realize they are your competition?? In what parallel universe does a competitor want the other company to treat their employees better? In the real world you want them to treat them like crap! It’s called the free market. If Bergelectric treats their employees below standards as you so claim (and with no evidence) wouldn’t you be jumping all over the opportunity to lure away their best employees?! I mean if the grass is so much greener on the other side wouldn’t their employees be defecting in droves to join the union?!
From the article is seems like Bergelectric does not only have very competitive bids, but is able to deliver a quality results. Why else would the largest employer in LA (USC) be giving these guys so many projects?
Lets get real here guys. Anyone can toss false accusations without proof, but in the end those people end up looking infantile.
Hold on Kristy Pike wrote this article? I don’t really know what to tell you other than do some homework before making ill informed statements.
As an Alumnus of USC, loyal reader of the Daily Trojan and long-time employee of the Bergelectric Corporation, I was extremely disappointed and disheartened by the lack of journalistic balance and research in your article entitled “Local Union Pickets for Better Health Care Benefits”.   Your article states several broad allegations by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) but does not include specifics of the allegations nor does the article include a response from Bergelectric.  As a journalist, you have a responsibility to write for the community that you observe and provide balanced information to allow your readers to draw fair conclusions based on the facts you present.  However, in this case, you have given a voice to once side of a debate while silencing another through inaction.  
The IBEW has a long-standing tradition of promoting the rights of their workers and for that I commend them, but to state publicly that Bergelectric does not do the same, particularly in the arena of healthcare benefits, is both untrue and irresponsible.  As a former field electrician of Bergelectric and now a manager, I can speak from personal experience that Bergelectric offers excellent benefits to employees, including healthcare and fair wages.  Bergelectric’s benefits meet or exceed those provided by the IBEW to their workers.  Further, Bergelectric offers these benefits with no hidden costs to the workers in stark contrast to the IBEW.  
This is not an issue isolated to the USC Campus but rather an epidemic in Los Angeles County.  The IBEW and associated groups consistently promote the institution of Project Labor Agreements (PLA’s) on public and private construction work predicated on the specious argument that non-union contractors do not offer comparable benefits to employees nor provide good wages.  This is not only discriminatory to non-union workers, but it is damaging to tax payers and community.  
Mr. Byron, you have a voice and a vehicle to communicate these facts to your community.  I implore you to do so in a responsible, fair and balanced way.
Shame on the “Journalist” and Editorial staff for publishing this story without fully researching the claims made by the union. Did you ask the Bergelectric employees if the claims made by the IBEW are true? How about asking their HR department what their benefits are? Simple fact checking would be nice every once in awhile and would actually present a complete story, this isn’t TMZ. Also wouldn’t the picketers like to know that they are picketing for no reason other than to try and cause bad press for USC and Bergelectric?
Fight on Bergelectric!!!  Thank you for providing us with quality projects at competitive prices so we can afford to make more and more improvements at our university.  Labor unions should work on their own image instead of trying to pick a part a successful business model.
88% of the construction workers in the United States are non-union. They must be doing something right.
We are, and thank you for noticing.   we don’t protect the the lazy or obese worker just because he calls me brother everyday. we exist on merit not mudslinging.
Unions have out lived their usefulness in protecting workers and become huge burdens costing the workers dues, productivity and jobs.  Everyone would LOVE what the unions ask for, but it is not possible.  Do you want to protest to get everything or live like the rest of the world and get what is possible?  Well done USC for getting the right contractor to the job, not just the one that threats you.
The unions and Kevin can cry all they want. They like to play spin doctor like a defense attorney.
Don’t they know USC has a fine business school……………….. No???? oh well that explains it.

USC will roll out a new campaign today in an effort to improve bike safety and encourage riders to develop more courteous bike behavior.
The “We are Considerate, We are USC” initiative is an effort to use the strength of the Trojan Family to enact positive changes on campus.  The university plans to use the programs’ principles to address the problems related to bikes on campus.
“It is not just about us enforcing a code of conduct, but looking out for one another, being safe on campus and not being distracted when we are on a bike, or even on foot,” said Thomas Studdert, the campaign’s project manager and director of Orientation Programs.
The campaign will be announced in a letter to students, faculty and staff from Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson, Vice President of Career and Protective Services Charles Lane, Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi and Graduate and Professional Student Senate President Ryan Estes. The letter attributes the increase in congestion from biking to USC becoming a more residential university.
With the campaign, Studdert said he hopes to make “considerate” the sixth “Trait of a Trojan,” after faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious.
“It’s going to be part of a larger campaign where people are more considerate on campus,” Tyagi said.
The campaign includes an Operations committee, which comprises representatives from a diverse range of parties, including the Dept. of Public Safety, USG, GPSS, the athletics department, Career and Protective Services and departments in Student Affairs.
“It’s out of hand for a university perspective as a whole,” Studdert said. “We are not just addressing bikes, we are addressing the culture of being considerate community members to one another. We are talking about a bigger picture. This is something that, as members of a Trojan Family, we need to do for one another.”
The bike initiative encompasses five key points: “share the pathways and yield to pedestrians,” “walk your bikes,” “encourage safety,” “park it” and “watch the road.” Studdert said the goals will be publicized in the coming months and at a kickoff event Nov. 7.
In addition to launching the campaign, the university has hired an external consulting firm, Kendall Planning and Design, to analyze the bike situation.
Though the ultimate goal of the campaign is to reduce reliance on DPS to enforce bike policy, Studdert said the university will increase bike rule enforcement in the coming months.
“We are going to have to move into a strict enforcement phase,” he said. “Over the course of the next couple of months, we are going to ratchet up the enforcement of existing bike policy or [policies] that might be suggested as part of the consulting process.”
The consulting firm will gather information, including the number of bikes on campus at various times of the day and student opinion for about eight to 12 months, after which the firm will make suggestions about bike policy on campus, Studdert said.
“They have done this at other campuses,” Studdert said. “They come in and look at the design and infrastructure of a campus.”
The school is not ruling out any possible policy changes, including bike bans or bike parking on the campus perimeter, Studdert said at last week’s USG Senate meeting.
“Everything and anything is on the table to have discussions throughout the process,” Studdert said.
Tyagi said although students would be upset by a bike ban, they will be equally upset if bike traffic becomes so congested pedestrians cannot walk safely on campus.
“Most students are on the same page and they are looking for some sort of compromise … where pedestrians and bikers can share the space safely and considerately,” Tyagi said.
Studdert said that unlike past campaigns, this effort has the support of key university officials.
“We have a president, provost and vice president for student affairs who are interested in addressing this problem,” he said.
The one-hour kickoff event next Wednesday, Nov. 9 near Tommy Trojan will include remarks from Tyagi, a performance from Kenton Chen, who graduated in 2010 and is a member of the a capella group Backbeats, and other activities. DPS will also be available for students to register their bikes.
Kendall Planning and Design will distribute surveys at the event.
