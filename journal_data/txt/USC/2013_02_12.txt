Students reacted after the administration announced Monday that Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Universal Music Group’s Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records unit and co-founder of Beats By Dr. Dre, will speak at the university’s  130th commencement ceremony.
Iovine began his four-decade career in the music industry when he was a teenager. Early in his career, he worked with John Lennon and Bruce Springsteen.
Interscope, which he co-founded in 1990, primarily deals with hip-hop, pop, rock and urban performers. The record label merged with Geffen Records and A&M Records in 1999. Artists that have signed with Interscope include Dr. Dre, Marilyn Manson, Kendrick Lamar and Azealia Banks.
Iovine also co-produced the 2002 movie 8 Mile, which starred the rapper Eminem. He was also the executive producer for LeBron James’ 2008 documentary More Than A Game.
In 2006, Iovine and hip-hop producer Dr. Dre created Beats, a high-performance headphone and sound transmission company. The company markets Beats headphones as well as speakers and other audio technologies.
Currently, Iovine also serves as a mentor on Fox’s American Idol. He uses his expertise and experience of the industry to guide the show’s contestants in their weekly musical challenges. Successful Idol contestants, such as Scotty McCreery and Phillip Phillips, now release their music through Interscope.
Some students believe Iovine and his advice will add compelling depth to the commencement ceremony.
“It was a good choice of USC to take someone who doesn’t have the same visibility as huge stars and huge famous people we have had before,” said Julia Riley, a senior majoring in art history and political science. “I don’t know his background as much or his view or what he can give us for advice, but I think someone who is that accomplished is someone we can learn from.”
Other students believe the university could have chose a more well-known speaker.
“I wish it could have been someone more renowned in a general sense,” said Ama Hayes, a senior majoring in communication. “Personally I am not going to be too thrilled or bragging to my family about it. But, at the end of the day, it is about the message he gives to us, so I’ll have to listen to him before I judge.”
Though students differ on how they view the selection of Iovine as a speaker, many believe that his diverse experiences will be applicable to students of all majors.
“Just because you are going to be a doctor or engineer does not mean you won’t be working with other fields,” said Andrew Inadomi, a sophomore majoring in music industry. “[Iovine is] a great example of how to better ourselves and make a name for the Trojan community out in the real world.”
Last year, Christiane Amanpour, the chief international correspondent for CNN, spoke at the commencement ceremony. In past years, former USC President Steven B. Sample, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, astronaut Neil Armstrong and comedian Bill Cosby have delivered the speech.
The commencement ceremony will take place on May 17. Honorary degree recipients have not yet been announced.
I have only heard of Jimmy Iovine because one of my favorite bands signed with Interscope and were very unhappy. For their next album, they made their own label and insult Jimmy and “Inter-coke Records” in several of their songs.
I guess Lady Gaga was too busy
LOL

UPDATE (Thursday, Feb. 14  — 4:15 p.m.): Medical examiners have positively identified the human remains found Tuesday evening in the burned-down cabin as those of suspected killer Christopher Dorner, according to multiple media sources.
UPDATE (Wednesday, Feb. 13 — 12:15 a.m.): San Bernardino County sheriff’s spokeswoman Jodi Miller has told the Associated Press and other media outlets that human remains have been found inside the burned-out cabin. It is unconfirmed whether the remains are those of suspect Christopher Dorner.
The manhunt for the suspected killer of USC Dept. of Public Safety officer Keith Lawrence, his fiancee Monica Quan and two law enforcement officers has taken a dramatic turn.
Law enforcement engaged in a shootout on Tuesday with a suspect, believed to be ex-Los Angeles Police Department officer Christopher Dorner, who had holed up in a cabin near Big Bear Lake, Calif. The confrontation ended with the cabin in flames, leaving questions of whether or not a body was found inside.
Several media sources said a body was found Tuesday evening in the remains of the cabin. These reports, however, conflict with the LAPD’s official announcement that no body has been found as of 10 p.m. Tuesday. If and when the body is found, it will also have to identified by law enforcement, a process that could take days or even weeks, according to LAPD.
Dorner, the suspect-at-large for the murders, was tracked into the mountains after his truck was found burning in the area last week. Law enforcement began searching the Big Bear area over the weekend, checking cabin-by-cabin for any evidence or tips.
Earlier Tuesday, Dorner allegedly broke into a home near Big Bear, tied up the residents and stole a pickup truck, according to the Los Angeles Times. Later that day, Dorner was allegedly spotted by state California Department of Fish and Wildlife officers, which led to a shootout between the two vehicles. Dorner then allegedly crashed the stolen truck and went inside a nearby cabin; though reports suggest he tried to escape into the woods, law enforcement kept him at bay until reinforcements arrived, according to multiple media reports.
When police arrived, they exchanged gunfire with the suspect and eventually broke down windows, fired tear gas into the cabin and asked over a loudspeaker for Dorner’s surrender. Not hearing a response, law enforcement used vehicles to begin ripping down the cabin’s walls one by one, according to various media sources. With one wall remaining, police heard a single gunshot, and flames began to engulf the remaining structure, according to the Times.
Two San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies were wounded; one of the deputies died from the injury, according to media reports. Dorner allegedly has now killed four people; along with Lawrence and Quan, Riverside police officer Michael Crain was killed in an ambush, according to ABC News.
For the sake of argument, this certainly looks like a situation where they could have waited the suspect out as he was thought to be alone (how would they know if there were in fact hostages?). He had a limited amount of ammunition, they had the area surrounded and cordoned off, and he has to sleep sometime whereas they could rotate the coverage of the perimeter.
The previous instance of police opening fire on the truck with women delivering papers makes it seem they did not want to take Dorner alive.

Approximately 100 students packed the east lobby of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Tuesday night for a live viewing of President Obama’s State of the Union address. Students of all political leanings gathered to watch as the president listed his legislative agenda before the 113th Congress.
Country talk · Matt Rodriguez, Austin Coleman, Dean Ernest Wilson III, Charlie Epting, Bill Simon and Dan Schnur speak at a panel Tuesday evening following President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
 
In addition to outlining his plans for the upcoming year, the president highlighted issues that will likely prove paramount throughout his entire second term.
Obama began his speech by addressing the economy and job creation. The president encouraged the return of manufacturing jobs to the United States, citing top American companies such asFord and Apple as examples of businesses committed to strengthening the U.S. job market.
The president also continued to emphasize themes of bipartisanship and across-the-aisle negotiations that have been central to past State of the Union addresses. Still, his speech served to reinforce some of the chief policy goals of the Democratic Party: comprehensive environmental reform, increased federal funding toward early-childhood education and tighter gun control legislation.
Obama’s plans resonated with many students. Arvind Iyer, a graduate student majoring in biomedical engineering, was optimistic about the plans.
“It is great to hear stuff about investment in education. The pre-school emphasis today was a welcome addition,” Iyer said.
The president committed a significant portion of his address to climate change and clean energy and made clear that environmental policy will play a more prominent role on the national agenda than it did in his first four years. He urged Congress to act on behalf of future generations by addressing the causes of increased global temperature, such as reducing carbon emissions. However, Obama was sure to announce that changes in environmental policy will come regardless of whether Congress chooses to act.
“I will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take,” Obama said.
Education was a prominent aspect of this year’s speech as well. Though calls for lowered college costs are not new for the president, he took his message beyond just the reforms necessary for pursuing higher education.
“Tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America,” Obama said.
Obama went on to stress the need for more rigorous high school curricula, citing Germany’s education system as an example of the more technical, job-ready high school programs that many countries have implemented.
As for the issue on many Americans’ minds, the president was unwavering in his insistence on passing stricter gun control laws. Referencing some of the more notable — and recent — instances of gun violence, Obama urged members of Congress to look beyond the confines of party politics and vote on behalf of a safer future for the country.
Students also resonated with the goals the president has for foreign policy.
Christian Aguilar-Castellanos, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry, believed the president’s announcement to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year was the most important part of the address. Yet, he expressed doubts in the plan’s implementation.
“My biggest concern has to do with foreign policy,” Aguilar-Castellanos said. “I know that Lockheed Martin and all those military contractors are thinking, ‘How are we going to keep this cash cow from getting away from us?’ That worries me.”
EJ Levin, a freshman majoring in international relations, remained optimistic with the points discussed in the president’s speech.
“Obama touched on a lot of points during his speech,” Levin said. “I’m interested to see which he’ll be able to follow up on, but I’m optimistic that we’ll see some big reforms in his second term.”
The president concluded his address by encouraging cooperation among Americans as they work to achieve new goals in the coming years.
“It remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story,” Obama said.
Once again Obama shows a startling failure to comprehend even basic economics with his desire to raise the minimum wage. All this is going to do is create inflation, increase pass through costs to consumers, and increase the unemployment rate. More class division. More victim narratives. More taxing. More entitlements. More euro-socialism. I can’t understand how people keep buying into this garbage. #liberalartsmajors

Last Friday, USC decided to part ways with offensive coordinator Kennedy Polamalu after three seasons on the job. Head coach Lane Kiffin offered a predictable and politically correct statement on the firing, saying “as we continue to evaluate all facets of our program, including the organization of our staff, we made the decision to go in a different direction at this coaching position. Kennedy Polamalu is a good coach, a good person and a good Trojan. We wish him and his family the best.”
We don’t really know why Polamalu was let go. That information probably won’t be disclosed anytime soon. And normally, the dismissal of an assistant coach wouldn’t really garner much analysis.
In this case, however, there’s another question worth examining: Was the timing of Polamalu’s firing ethical?
Think about it: National signing day was Feb. 6. Polamalu was fired on Feb. 8. It’s not unreasonable to believe that some of the new recruits, especially on the offensive side of the ball, could be influenced by the fluidity of USC’s coaching staff. So was this move put off until after the Trojans officially recruited the prospects they were hoping to lock up?
My best guess: Probably. And while it’s not a particularly proud moment for Kiffin and company, firing a coach a few days after signing day is about as tame as it gets during an incredibly tense recruiting period.
If another coach had done something similar to Kiffin (and surely other coaches have done something similar in the past), there would be significantly less blowback from the media and the team’s fan base. That’s not to play the “woe is me” card for Kiffin — after a string of dishonest maneuvers last season, including the infamous ball-deflating incident, USC’s coach really doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt anymore.
That doesn’t mean what he did this time around was particularly wrong though.
The recruiting process in 2013 is about as cut-throat as it gets. Prospects change their minds on where to go to school on a day-to-day basis. Case in point: highly regarded linebacker Reuben Foster committed to Auburn, got a tattoo of his soon-to-be alma mater, and ended up choosing rival Alabama on signing day. USC needed every scholarship it could get, especially after multiple verbal commits ended up going elsewhere when it came down to decision-making time.
Add in the crippling sanctions that continue to limit the Trojans’ options on a year-to-year basis, and it becomes increasingly harder to blame Kiffin for making a tactical decision of sorts.
It sounds strange summing up the job security of a coach as a tactical decision, but that’s essentially what it was. Polamalu was an important recruiter in the program and helped bring in running back Ty Isaac, among others. Kiffin likely knew long before Friday he didn’t want to keep Polamalu around, but he needed to keep the outside appearance of stability in the coaching staff. Besides, for all we know, recruits and even Polamalu himself knew what was coming.
If no one involved in the signing day process had any idea of the impending firing, then Kiffin’s maneuvers become a little more suspect. That would change things from a strategic decision to something less acceptable. From all indications, Polamalu was a well-regarded figure in the locker room, and his firing was met with a fair amount of opposition from Trojan players. Ultimately, though, Kiffin made a choice, and dwelling on his motives isn’t worth the time and effort.
After a 7-6 season, Kiffin is on the hot seat more than Haden will ever admit. It’s put-up or shut-up time for the Trojans, who, admittedly, won’t be as talented as the last season’s underachieving squad. Kiffin has been criticized for his lack of creativity at times with the play-calling, especially with weapons such as sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee and junior running back Silas Redd at his disposal. This is his chance to show that he’s capable of righting the ship. Bring in a new offensive coordinator, take the issue seriously and make the offense a top priority.
Polamalu wasn’t the problem for the Trojans in 2012. In the end though, he took the fall for the Trojans’ coaching staff. The timing of the move was questionable, but if Kiffin can make amends next season, all will be forgiven and forgotten.

back in the early 70s.same thing happend to at bmhs.then other coach went afterother coachs until hegot the head coaching job.he did not produce.stayed until released.bs the people at lbst.anthony.did the same there,got booted out there also.same goes for the recent deal on the pope same thing,things are getting hot.got to bail out. look at mahony,and he has the testicles to wear a cross around his neck.
are you trying to be the DT’s version of scott wolf? is this the new yellow journalisma dn do you too have an ax to grind like that hack at the daily news? How many asst coaches fled to new jobs the day after signing day? including the georgia o line coach, their dc, the florida dc,. the bama o line coach…do you think those too were also spur of the moment? dont you realize that they too waited until after signing day to announce? its not kiffen that is the problem, it is the media like yourselves who keep harping and counting on page hits, sad journalism and nowhere near objective. Kiffen had nothing to do with the footballs etc. why keep mentionint it like its gospel he did? wow
Your lack on knowledge on this particual subject, the one your have chosen to opine on, is very troubling. If you had done any investigation at all, instead of just suposition, you might have written a half-way interesting article. But, since you seem to have no knowlege of what everyone else knows, from just reading blogs from the recruits, concerning this situation, your are just a day late and a dollar short.
On the other hand, yes, when the Head Coach fires a large number of his staff while he remains, it is very troubling indeed, as the problems seem to be related to the Head Coach and not to his staff.

As a result of her stellar play over this past weekend, USC women’s tennis standout Danielle Lao was selected as the Pac-12 women’s player of the week.
Strong performance · Senior Danielle Lao (above) defeated two top-10 opponents during the ITA National Team Indoor championships. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Competing in the ITA National Team Indoor championships in Charlottesville, Va., Lao led the Trojans with two victories against top-10 opponents in singles play, including a tournament-opening upset over Virginia’s No. 4-ranked Julia Elbaba in straight sets.
Lao followed that the next day with another straight-set win over North Carolina’s No. 30-ranked Zoe De Bruycker. And Lao concluded the weekend with yet another upset, this time over Cal’s No. 1-ranked Zsofi Susanyi. The 7-5, 6-1 victory clinched the Trojans’ defeat of the Bears.
Lao was also strong in doubles play, teaming up with sophomore Giuliana Olmos to go 2-1 over the course of the weekend. That record included a clinching victory over the Tar Heels’ ranked pair.
The senior, from Arcadia, Calif., is currently ranked No. 3 in the nation and holds a 15-3 overall record in singles on the season in addition to a perfect record in dual-match singles play. She is the third Trojan to be named Pac-12 women’s player of the week, following recognition of Olmos and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria.
Following their 2-1 showing at the ITAs, which included the squad’s first loss of the 2013 campaign, the Trojans fell from No. 4 to No. 6 nationally. The loss came at the hands of North Carolina in excruciating 4-3 fashion. Following the matchup against San Diego State, the Women of Troy will begin Pac-12 play with a rematch against the Golden Bears in Berkeley on Feb. 23.
On the year, the Trojans are 7-1 overall, including an impressive 4-0 mark at home. Having just finished up in Charlottesville this past Sunday, the Women of Troy will get a miniature break before returning to action on Feb. 20 with a matchup against the San Diego State Aztecs at Marks Stadium at 1:30 p.m.

It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to say that there is no athletic program at USC with loftier expectations than baseball.
What’s next? · The USC baseball team finished the 2011-12 season with a 25-31 record, ending the year with a 13-1 defeat against the Washington State Cougars. The Trojans have had just one winning season in 10 years. – Daily Trojan File Photo
Twelve College World Series championships, the most all-time by twice as many as Texas’ six. Third all-time in wins over 117 seasons. One of, if not the most famous, baseball coaches in NCAA history: Rod Dedeaux.
In short, USC baseball has plenty of pedigree to its name. And a lot of history too. But as of right now, history is about all the USC baseball program can claim.
As the Trojan baseball program nears the completion of its twelfth decade in existence, 2012 concluded what was unquestionably the worst 10-year span in its history. Of the 1,354 losses USC baseball has suffered in its 123-year history, 277 have come in the last 10 years. That’s 22 percent. USC has had a winning record just once in the last 10 years.
That’s an awful lot of numbers, none of them very good. And the program will be hard-pressed to get those numbers to change.
Per the NCAA and Title IX, a college baseball team is allowed 11.7 total scholarships to divvy up as the program sees fit among a maximum of 27 players. And each player receiving scholarship money must be awarded at least a quarter scholarship. As such, the majority of players on a team will be paying for a significant portion, if not all, of their time on the team.
That poses an issue for all college baseball programs, none of which can come close to fielding a full team of full scholarship athletes. But the problem is compounded at private schools  such as USC, where tuition is often two or three times as much as those of its public counterparts.
“Of all the sports in college athletics, statistics show that baseball is the most difficult one for private schools to be consistently competitive on a championship level,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said. “And the numbers are trending downward.”
In Southern California, the top college baseball programs are currently Cal State Fullerton and UCLA. According to each school’s website, the estimated total expenses for a year at Fullerton is $25,000 and $31,000 at UCLA. At USC, it’s $60,000.
Though UCLA can split a scholarship among two players and leave them about $15 thousand per year to pay out of pocket, USC can award just one player a 75 percent scholarship to leave them with a similar cost. And if a player’s family has money to afford $25,000 per year, it will cost USC more than half a scholarship, while at Fullerton they can pay full tuition and not count against the 11.7 limit at all.
“We have a ton of guys -— significant role players and even some starters — who are walk-ons,” USC head coach Frank Cruz said. “But we’re also lucky in that this is USC. We have a lot of people who want to come play here and are willing to pay to do it.”
Private schools are able to make up for the competitive disadvantage against public schools because of the amount of need-based aid the school gives out. However, competition for need-based aid is among all students, not just athletes. And the same goes for academic scholarships too. It becomes a never-ending mix-and-match game for coaches who try to give as much help as they can to as many players as they can.
“We’ve got some guys who certainly had the GPA (out of high school) to get some sort of academic scholarship,” Cruz said. “But they didn’t have the same resumes as the students who get those packages. They’ve been too busy playing baseball.”
This issue is further compounded because a student receiving even a portion of an athletic scholarship is not eligible for any need-based financial aid. And while the 11.7 scholarship limit is equal among all schools, the amount of financial aid schools give is most certainly not.
Eight teams make the College World Series every year. In the last decade, just 14 of 80 have been private schools. The last time a private school won or even made the finals of the College World Series was Rice in 2003. Rice has a considerable endowment of $4.5 billion, and that manifests itself in the financial aid packages the school gives out. According to the College Board, students from families that make less than $75,000 in income pay an average of just $10,000 per year at Rice, compared to the full cost of $52,000.
The last private school to make the College World Series was Vanderbilt in 2011. At Vanderbilt, all students who are eligible to receive loans simply receive an academic scholarship of the same value instead of the loan they are eligible for.
Stanford’s $16.5-billion endowment is the fourth largest in the country and far and away the largest endowment of any non-Ivy League school. All students from families making less than $100,000 per year receive free tuition. Students from families making less than $60,000 per year receive free tuition and free room and board.
USC gives out a good bit of financial aid too. While the university doesn’t offer quite the same packages as Stanford, both Haden and Cruz believe that the program can still be competitive.
“The expectation is certainly there by all of us at private schools to win national championships in all of our sports,” Haden said. “But baseball programs at private schools have to work hard, be creative in their approach and have some luck and good fortune come into the equation.”
Cruz echoed Haden’s sentiments.
“It can be a challenge, but we’re still just as capable of getting great players as any other program,” Cruz said. “We’re a great school with great facilities. I mean, this is USC baseball after all.”
All nothing but excuses from the athletic dept. Divide the scholarships in half and you have 23 players who have
a partial one. Like stated there are grants and loans. The good recruits who turn pro are more a problem of the
coaching staff than anything else. How about a top tier head coach to turn the program around?

The movement known as V-Day began 14 years ago from the “outrageous idea that we could end violence against women.” This goal, as described above by V-Day pioneer Eve Ensler, has created a new culture celebrated at USC with the annual production of The Vagina Monologues.
According to the Family Violence Prevention Fund, one in three women will face sexual or physical assault in her lifetime. For 2013, V-Day sought to emphasize that ending violence against women is a global battle with the theme One Billion Rising.
The Vagina Monologues provides an artistic medium to raise awareness about these issues of violence through camaraderie and comedy, by way of vaginas. V-Day aims to raise campus awareness within the student body concerning the problems faced by students with vaginas by engaging the campus in the show and reducing the stigma of discussion surround vaginas.
Samantha Brown, the current director of the production,  said she became involved because the organization has gotten smaller since people have graduated. She believes the show to be insightful and that everyone should see it. Since USC once hosted the author of The Vagina Monologues, the goal is to revitalize the organization to its greatest period of involvement seen in 2009.
Francesca Bessey, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies and international relations, said she was drawn to her involvement with V-Day and The Vagina Monologues in an effort to exemplify how diverse the student body is and to engage issues of gender, race and sexual violence which are underrepresented at USC.
The monologues, with names like “Hair” and “My Vagina Was My Village,” range in tone from comedic to heartfelt, emotions that will be communicated by the cast of 28 students. The female-identified cast was recruited and auditioned late last semester, with directors Alexis Agolsove and Katelyn Morse  matching them with particular monologues. The cast has been diligently rehearsing for the show at the Village Gate Theater.
Brown hopes that attendees will feel compelled to stand up this year and join One Billion Rising after seeing the show. The show looks not only to enlighten but also enliven in this way.
To contribute to the movement at large, V-Day at USC is supporting programs actively engaged in work against domestic violence. All of the proceeds from The Vagina Monologues will benefit V-Day USC’s nonprofit partner, A Window Between Worlds. This is a nonprofit that works to use art to combat domestic violence and facilitates the healing and empowerment of survivors through their creative expression projects.
The organization’s curriculum of renewing art has helped over 74,000 women and children since 1991. As a contribution to V-Day’s One Billion Rising effort, A Window Between Worlds developed its own project called “I Can We Can” where people create art on their palms expressing what they can do to fight, bring awareness to or overcome different forms of gender violence we encounter.
After creating their piece, people are invited to upload an image to the catalogue of images on A Window Between Worlds’ website, which functions as a compilation of action-worthy statements regarding the movement against domestic violence. People will be able to participate in this project both at The Vagina Monologues show and later in the semester on Trousdale Parkway.
Other productions of The Vagina Monologues and the movement at large have raised more than $90 million, benefited numerous community-based programs dedicated to anti-violence causes and helped to sustain shelters among other philanthropic efforts. The V-Day campaign has been acknowledged for its outstanding charitable work in publications including Worth’s 100 Best Charities and Marie Claire’s Top 10 Charities.
Despite its unique and slightly risque title, The Vagina Monologues is a production well worth seeing this Valentine’s Day weekend.
 
This was/is a great movement. One of my biggest hopes is that while they are raising awareness of the struggles that women face and especially in a violent situation is that they do remember to mention the children. It seems so logical to try to get the women out of the situation, perhaps to educate the violent offenders or better yet incarcerate them. This seems logical. This is how the medical community would approach the problem. Wait for the symptom to show up then treat. This is wrong. The Cycle starts with the children of domestic violence. cdv.org has put out a great documentary the trailer can be seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPcsuNbnJ68 Break the cycle. Show the children there is another way.

Is it cool to bring the ’90s back yet? The songs featured in this week’s edition of New Noise sure seem to suggest that it is. With the rise of computer-generated technology in producing music, hearing tunes that use actual instruments has become rare in today’s mainstream hip-hop scene.
From the solemn piano in Mistah F.A.B. and Nerina Pallot’s new tracks to the sharp, acoustic guitar on Wale’s latest, this week’s spotlighted songs call back to the good old days of ’90s hip hop and R&B. Whether it’s the legendary Original Regulator Warren G making a production appearance or the mad talent of Gerson & Tristan bringing back the smooth hip-hop beats of the early ’90s, the styles of the old are resurrected and refined. There’s even a CeCe Peniston cover featured, so enough said.
Mistah F.A.B.: “Dreams”
Missing the mid-’90s? This song is likely to take you back. Oakland rapper Mistah F.A.B. is one of the kings of freestyle, known for taking on numerous rappers and being able to freestyle for insane amounts of time. Part of the Bay Area hip-hop talent, Mistah F.A.B. is releasing his third mixtape in his “Backpack” series later on this year, and “Dreams” is the first leak from the edition. With its heavy bass and dreamy (see what I did there?) ascending piano, the song sounds like a throwback R&B song. Lyrically, Mistah F.A.B. does not disappoint, delivering introspective rhymes with his trademark effortless emceeing. The song is produced by the one and only Warren G, who makes a good decision putting Mistah F.A.B.’s vocals in the forefront. If there’s any weakness in the song, it would probably be the chorus — the constant whispering of “dream” in the background is a little too obvious and ends up sounding slightly cheesy. Otherwise, the simple production works for the track and the piano is a nice touch for atmosphere. Any time there’s piano in a rap song, you know that it’s legit — this is what happens when regulators get serious.
Gerson & Tristan: “Night Life”
There’s stoner rock, but is there such a genre as stoner rap? (Or is that a little redundant?) Gerson & Tristan are set to release its first EP sometime this year, and the group’s latest single solidifies the leftfield vibe that it’s been honing to perfection. In “Night Life,” the Richmond Hill duo spits smooth flows alongside a steady, pure hip-hop beat that takes its time. The staccato raps blend well against the silky production of the track; both emcees drop their rhymes as if each word of theirs was walking over a fire pit, jumping up at every burning coal it touched.
That style, showcased over the glossy, laidback beat, makes for a compelling combination that takes the listener on a gravity-defying audio experience. Produced by MutaBeatz, “Night Life” is the length of an epic punk song (i.e. just under three minutes), and even though the chilled track fronts as if it has all the time in the world, it leaves the listener wanting more of the velvet beats and sleek style of the talented twosome.
Wale featuring Tiara Thomas: “Bad”
D.C. rapper Wale emerged onto the rap scene in 2005 as a unique and mega-talented emcee who stood out from the rest of the vocalists in the mainstream hip-hop scene. His 2009 album, Attention Deficit, was one of the best of the year, being nearly flawless as a whole.
Then, in 2011, he sold his soul to Rick Ross and released the aptly titled Ambition, which had maybe two good tracks on it — the rest were all bawse’d out, and Wale lost all of the uniqueness that made him different in the first place, becoming just another Maybach clone.
His new album, Bad, is scheduled to be released sometime this year, and if “Bad” is any example of what we can expect from him, it’s something to look forward to, only because it doesn’t sound like Rick Ross hijacked the album.
Aside from a borderline-annoying, squeaky metronome in the background, the song is produced with no frills or extras. Drums, bass, acoustic guitar and vocals — “Bad” is more of a return to Wale’s original style, where he used actual instruments to back his songs instead of the Maybach machine. The chorus is headed by the talented Tiara Thomas, who is becoming a staple of the Wale team, and her sharply scuffed vocals are perfect for the Kelson-produced track about relationships gone “Bad.”
Nerina Pallot: “Finally”
Veteran singer-songwriter Nerina Pallot is releasing her Lonely Valentine Club EP this week, and one of the five tracks on the record is “Finally,” a cover of the uber-famous 1991 CeCe Peniston song. Peniston’s original is one of the most famous dance songs ever and, though other covers have been recorded, Pallot’s version is downright amazing.
The Brit’s strong yet melancholy vocals take complete control over the track and change the entire vibe of the song. All the words that you would never use to describe the original — haunting, sorrowful, profound, arcane — are the only words that define Pallot’s adaptation. All of a sudden, hearing the words “Finally, it’s happened to me” doesn’t make you want to bust out your best dance moves, but instead makes you a little worried about what exactly has finally happened to you.
With the sparse production and woeful piano (see, pianos make everything serious), Pallot makes “Finally” sound like a deep and wonderfully reflective hymn about self-discovery, and the steadiness of her vocals bring a tranquility to the still seriousness of the track. Pallot truly owns the song and illustrates how to properly do a cover. Listen and learn, kids.

In our society, the words ‘Valentine’s Day’ are either welcomed with a warm rush of affection or looked down upon with a cynical sneer. Like it or hate it, it is inevitable that on this “day of love” people everywhere will be left feeling harried and pressured to prove their affection for their significant others through material objects.

This year, instead of diving into the consumerist mosh pit, choose to rediscover the true meaning of love in a new and refreshingly unmaterialistic yet entertaining way. Los Angeles’ very own Elephant Theatre Company has created what it advertises to be “An Evening of Dysfunctional, Not-So-Romantic Short Plays.” The series of vignettes — aptly named Love Bites — incorporates plays written both by company members and playwrights from around the country and are performed and directed by Elephant Company members.
With eight different plays within this production, there is something for everyone. The plays range from absurdist to realistic, and all have a unique commentary on love and relationships. For instance, take the physically driven play The Name Game, written by Gloria Calderon Kellett and directed by Brendan Farrell. A comedy of errors, this one-act shows a man named Paul (Nelson DelRosario), who, in the middle of a steamy moment with his partner, accidentally calls her by her best friend’s name. Sarah (Maya Parish), upon finding out that Paul actually thinks about several of her friends during intimate moments with her, responds in a shockingly raunchy and hilarious manner by describing and showing just how much other men (such as Paul’s father) turn her on during those aforementioned intimate moments. Parish bravely and successfully portrays just the right amount of sexual power and manipulation during the scene, while still allowing for a realistically touching look at the vulnerability and hurt her character experiences after hearing her husband call out her best friend’s name.
Farrell also aids both actors in showcasing the complexity, hilarity and heartbreak of such a fight by, as he puts it, “allowing the actors to shine through physicality and prove their argument in the most interesting manner possible.”
Indeed, having Parish and DelRosario crawling, jumping and falling in and around the bed — the main set piece of the play — creates a very entertaining and captivatingly physical approach to the initial argument.
Though bawdy and sexy on the surface, The Name Game is at its core a sympathetic and heartfelt look at the dynamics between a couple and the profound affection that runs between two partners, even in the face of adversity.
The other shows are just as multi-faceted in their supposed cynicism on the subject of relationships. At first glance, each one appears to disprove the romantic myth of love — one, Studio Head by Louis Jacobs, even goes so far as having a half-naked male escort/actor die at the hands of his studio-executive mistress on stage. However, each piece reveals a deep and surprisingly truthful look at the emotions that different couples experience in a relationship.
Take the least comedic and most symbolic play of the bunch, Humpty Dumpty by Deana Barone. The beautifully sentimental piece shows a woman telling a man a sort of bedtime story about an egg whose shell could not be broken and a worm who finally breaks it with a hug.
The play is lit only by a faint blue light and the creative use of a single flashlight. This gives the whole performance a very intimate and raw feel and works to draw the audience further into the story being told. Lead actor of the piece, Marco Naggar, describes the play as being “cynical yet touching,” adding that it was “[rather] fun to go against the grain and commercialism of Valentine’s Day” by performing in such a different show.
For a show so fervently advertised and described as being skeptical and scornful toward love, Love Bites is filled with tenderness and compassion and, most importantly, a truthful look at the craziness and passion behind human devotion and affection. Though there were moments in the performances when the absurdist nature of some plays as well as some momentary overacting by the performers was confusing, the production is very entertaining and successful at offering an invigoratingly honest look at love.
 
Love Bites runs at the Elephant Theatre at 6322 Santa Monica Blvd., through March 2, with regular admission tickets priced at $20, while a special “Anti-Valentine’s Day” event on Feb. 14 will be $30 per ticket. To purchase tickets or for further information, visit www.ElephantTheatre.org or call 855-663-6743.

Though the recent regime changes that took place during the Arab Spring proved to be a victory for social media and democracy, its aftermath, plagued by uncertainty and ambiguous goals, has nearly undermined the entire movement. It seemingly shows the inherent problems of having a revolution shift toward a form of retribution rather than the pursuit of a brighter future.
Positive · René Saavedra (Gael García Bernal) leads a revolutionary positive political campaign to unseat Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in No. Saavedra’s advertisements mobilized voters to elect a parliamentary government. – Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film  shows that by using marketing and advertising techniques to promote the prospect of happiness, rather than vengeance, as a weapon against the previous regime, genuine political and social change can be achieved.
The film, set in 1988, centers on the Chilean public’s opportunity to decide whether or not General Augusto Pinochet should be allowed to stay in power or leave office.
After a growing amount of international pressure forces the military dictator to allow the Chilean public to decide whether or not he should stay in office, the government, which still controls the airwaves, only allows the opposition, known simply as the NO coalition, to have 15 minutes of campaign marketing on public airwaves during the 27 nights leading up to the election.
The NO coalition selects a young TV marketing expert, René Saavedra (Gael García Bernal) to spearhead the people’s marketing campaign to oust Pinochet. Instead of focusing on the heinous acts committed by Pinochet, be it the CIA-backed military coup d’état, the thousands of imprisoned political prisoners or even the desaparecidos — the thousands of people who “disappeared” through the years — Saavedra does something novel, focusing the campaign on ideas of happiness and optimism.
Despite skepticism and criticism that the campaign will become something similar to a Coke commercial, Saavedra stands by his decision, reasoning that if the campaign resorts to criticism and fear, they’ll lose the vote.
The NO campaign was revolutionary for its time, transforming political campaigning into a hybrid of commercialism and feathery optimism. Though some might argue that the campaign contributed to the dumbing down of politics,  it was nevertheless a  remarkably effective campaing, with 55.99 percent of Chileans voting ‘no’ to an extended Pinochet reign. Perhaps even more remarkable was that the campaign also encouraged an incredible 97.52 percent of the eligible voting population to turn out to cast their ballot.
Chilean director Pablo Larraín approaches the material, based on the unpublished play El Plebiscito by Antonio Skármeta, very much like the main character would. Though it would certainly be effective to remind the audience of the tyranny of the Pinochet regime, by steering the film with optimism and the simplicity of saying “no” to the past and “yes” to the future, the film proves to be an effective reminder of the power of optimism in the face of tyranny.
There has been some criticism that Larraín in many ways simplified a political campaign to a TV commercial. However, Larraín seems fully aware that the silliness and possible detriment of reducing a campaign to this and, if one pays attention, it is clear that the film itself does carry some notes of irony. The film makes a point to show that Saavedra, who is solely committed to the idealism of marketing, is slightly unhappy himself and feels uncertain of his own future.
Bernal himself also strikes the right balance between cockiness and pathos, and the little moments of weakness and exposure his character goes through stand out against the image of the hotshot ad executive he generally presents himself as.
For the look of the film, Larraín took the novel approach of using low definition, 3/4’ Sony U-matic magnetic tape, which was widely used by television news in Chile during that time. By using the same analog cameras, Larraín creates a level of seamlessness comparable to the look of Forrest Gump, with the film fading in and out of the actual commercials and political ads used during the campaign.
In some areas, the line between the film and the actual footage is flawless; nowhere is this more  evident than in scenes depicting actual police crackdowns and pro-democratic assemblies. At a certain point, you’re no longer able to tell the difference between the two, which gives the film an impressive sense of verisimilitude.
Much like the campaign at the core of the feature, the film No is efficient, memorable and doesn’t get bogged down in the details. Though it might not dig too deep into the state of the culture or the mentality of the Chilean populace, the film makes a valid point that sometimes the simplest approach is the most effective for providing a positive experience for those involved, both politically and emotionally.

The detrimental effects of USC Hook-Ups
Of course when I came across the USC Hook-Ups Facebook page this evening on my Facebook, I eagerly perused the posts with my roommate and laughed over some of the better-worded sexploits detailed on the page.
However, as the evening progressed and more and more updates began to pop up, accompanied by an influx of “likes,” I started to get a bit more disturbed. Rather than fulfill its stated purpose of “help[ing] the fellow Trojan reconnect with that hot piece of ass, [etc.],” the posts have instead took a turn for the worse by calling numerous people out on their failures in bed. As one post reads, “You went down on me last week and it was the worst thing ever. Don’t ever think about calling me again.” The recipients of the post are highlighted through highly recognizable personable traits.
This is so heartbreaking to me. Especially compared to my high school promiscuity levels, I’ve been a nun here at USC, so I’m not too concerned about my own reputation, but I’m perturbed as I watch my own great, altruistic community crumble before my eyes.
As a transfer student, one aspect of USC that stood out to me as the largest positive and unique element was the “Trojan Family,” This concept is more cheesy than EVK pizza — or that analogy — but seriously, it exists. I attended another university, one that was consistently ranked in the top three in student satisfaction in the United Kingdom, but I can tell you that this family spirit is unique in a college and something to be treasured.
It’s the spirit of supporting one another, of helping out in simple ways and it’s the reason that USC has been lauded so much for helping out our gritty surrounding community. And I sincerely believe it’s being undermined by a page that seems to exist to publicly humiliate other members of our Cardinal and Gold community.
It’s interesting to juxtapose this page with the far less nefarious “USC Compliments” Facebook page, in which people can offer anonymous compliments to those they love or even strangers. How paradoxical that these two pages on the same social networking site can exist, and that one can cause so many positive vibes while the other is just ratchet. Maybe both of these types of pages are national or worldwide trends — I’m not sure — but I once believed that we could distinguish between the positive and negative at USC and choose correctly between the two. Obviously, I was wrong.
There will always be nasty people in the world who take some satisfaction in the mortification of others, but I sincerely wish I hadn’t seen so clearly how many there are and how cruel they are at USC. I’ve felt like I was looking at the world through rose-colored glasses during my semester and a quarter here, but apparently that was a fantasy that had to end. To all of those who have been mentioned on the page, I hope that you have more stalwart self-esteem than I would in your position. Take comfort that “haters gonna hate,” as they say. I guess I myself can look at the bright side and say thanks, USC Hook-Ups: avoiding public degradation is a good incentive to keep my panties on.

I agree with your sentiment regarding the Hook-Ups page. Anonymity paradoxically lets people show their true face. It’s disheartening to see that, rather than being sex-positive, a portion of the submitters use the page as an opportunity for slut-shaming and homophobic jokes. 
Perhaps this comes as a shock to some guys, but if you want girls to have sex with you, you probably shouldn’t go around discouraging girls from having sex. Just my two cents.

A year after President Barack Obama rejected the original construction permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, the proposed project has once again become a popular discussion topic among policymakers. Critics of Keystone have been outspoken about the potential environmental risks the pipeline could pose, but these objections have largely drowned out those extolling the significant benefits associated with it.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
Many do not understand that environmental friendliness and economic growth need not be mutually exclusive. Policymakers must work to implement a plan that will allow the construction of the pipeline without further delay while also providing thorough environmental oversight. Continued inaction would only result in delayed progress toward energy independence and unnecessarily deprive the United States of some much-needed economic growth.
The pipeline, which would bring about 700,000 barrels of tar sands oil from Canada to oil refineries on the Gulf Coast every day, would not only generate revenue and create thousands of jobs for our underemployed workforce, but would also bring the country closer to energy independence from far-off, potentially hostile nations in the process creating more resources for developing cleaner alternative energy sources.
Just this past Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry met with Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird to discuss their countries’ shared interests with regard to the pipeline. Though Kerry remained vague on any specific plans and when (or if) they would be finalized, Baird summarized something that everyone engaged in the Keystone debate needs to consider: “We all share the need for a growing economy to create jobs, the desire [for] energy security in North America. And we also share the objective of protecting our environment for future generations.”
The economic benefits should not be understated. According to builder TransCanada, for example, the Keystone pipeline could generate 20,000 jobs in the construction phase alone. And oil sands development following construction could create or support well over 600,000 U.S. jobs by 2035, according to the Canadian Energy Research Institute. Additionally, $20 billion could be pumped into the U.S. economy through Keystone, a figure that does not even account for the estimated $5 billion that the Keystone project would pay to local counties throughout its lifetime.
Perhaps the most far-reaching advantage of Keystone is the potential that it brings for American energy independence. Tapping into the abundant oil resources on our own continent would greatly decrease our dependence on oil from ideologically different countries and with that allow us to end expensive — and not to mention environmentally detrimental — entanglements with oil-producing nations. The money and resources subsequently saved could then be reallocated toward research and development of alternative energy sources.
Environmentally speaking, Keystone has passed three different environmental reviews at the behest of the State Department. Past controversy over the originally proposed route of the pipeline is now a moot point as well, since the route has been re-adjusted to avoid sensitive areas in Nebraska.
Those who make the argument that Keystone would damage the environment and contribute to global climate change also overlook the fact that the oil the United States imports often comes from nations that do not give much consideration to environmental impact or work to combat climate change. By relying on Canadian oil sources, the United States would not only reduce its crippling dependence on oil from potentially hostile countries but also have more oversight of environmental precautions when it comes to oil production. Continuing to adhere to the not-in-my-backyard mindset displayed by some environmental activists with a one-track mind would thus be both hypocritical and damaging.
Instead of taking us further from clean and independent energy in America, the Keystone pipeline would actually allow the country to take a step toward it by removing our reliance on Middle Eastern nations for their oil and focusing attention on developing clean, renewable energy sources. The sooner policymakers and the public realize this, the sooner real and lasting change will begin to take root for the future of energy.

It’s been called the coldest place in America and, more recently, the luckiest place on Earth. But whatever you call it, North Dakota is the premier economic safe haven – thanks largely to the state’s largest oil boom in history.
Seven years ago, North Dakota ranked as the nation’s ninth most oil-producing territory; today, the state ranks second, behind only oil-producing giant Texas.
North Dakota has experienced oil booms before, but none quite like this most recent explosion in the Bakken Formation, an approximately 200,000 square mile patch of land near the western border of the state.
Due to local businesses’ bottomless need for employees – in sectors including retail, food service, and law enforcement, along with on the thousands of oil rigs in the area – CNN reports that one can find work earning over $15 an hour serving burgers, $25 an hour waiting tables, or even $2,000 a night dancing at one of the two strip clubs in Williston, ND.
Of course, the influx of residents and laborers has brought almost as many negative consequences as well. Since the oil boom, violent crime has more than doubled in North Dakota. However, the number of violent crimes is still considerably less than a state like California, which experienced 527.8 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens in 2004 compared to North Dakota’s 80.2 crimes per 100,000 citizens.
Nevertheless, with a $3.8 billion budget surplus and the lowest unemployment in the country, North Dakota is simply a great place to live right now.

The 2013 commencement address will be delivered by Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Universal Music Group’s Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records unit and co-founder of the Beats By Dr. Dre.
Iovine began his four-decade career in the music industry when he was a teenager. Early in his career he worked with John Lennon and Bruce Springsteen.
Interscope, which he co-founded in 1990, primarily deals with hip-hop, pop, rock and urban performers. The record label merged with Geffen Records and A&M Records in 1999. Artists that have signed with Interscope include Dr. Dre, Marilyn Manson, Kendrick Lamar and Azealia Banks.
Iovine also co-produced the 2002 movie 8 Mile, which starred the rapper Eminem. He was and the executive producer for LeBron James’ 2008 documentary More Than A Game.
In 2006, Iovine and hip-hop producer Dr. Dre created Beats, a high-performance headphone and sound transmission company. The company markets Beats headphones as while as speakers and earphones.
Currently, Iovine serves as a mentor on Fox’s American Idol. He uses his expertise and experience of the industry to guide the show’s contestants in their weekly musical challenges. Successful Idol contestants, such as Scotty McCreery and Phillip Phillips, now release their music through Interscope.
Last year, Christiane Amanpour, the chief international correspondent for CNN, spoke at the commencement ceremony and in past years former USC President Steven B. Sample, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, astronaut Neil Armstrong and comedian Bill Cosby have delivered the speech.
The commencement ceremony will take place on May 17. Honorary degree recipients have not yet been announced.
