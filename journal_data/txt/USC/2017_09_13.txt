Daniel Zhu | Daily Trojan
There were many question marks surrounding USC after its season-opening scare against Western Michigan. In particular, the Trojan defense seemed to have trouble keying in on the Broncos’ rushing defense. WMU out-rushed USC 263 yards to 232 — even as the running back duo of junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr averaged more than nine yards per carry and combined for five touchdowns.
It looked like more of the same to start last weekend, as Stanford brought its potent rushing offense to the Coliseum. Cardinal running back Bryce Love torched the Trojans for 102 yards on the ground in the first quarter alone, including a deflating 75-yard scamper that tied the score at seven immediately after USC had pushed in front. At the end of the first 15 minutes of play, Trojan runners were averaging less than four yards per carry; Love was averaging north of 20.
It wasn’t an ideal start, especially for a team with high hopes that seemed to be trending downward after Week 1. But no one was panicking in the Trojan locker room.
“Our saying is to stay up here all game long for four quarters,” junior linebacker Cameron Smith said. “Everyone’s buying in on that.”
Mantras like that often fall by the wayside when teams fail to adjust, but USC was a different defensive team for the final 45 minutes of Saturday’s game. Stanford rushed for only 68 yards over the next three quarters combined. The Trojans stopped five runs for a loss, the offense built up a lead and the Cardinal were forced to take to the air. Then, USC unleashed its full might — as the team had been preparing to do all week.
“[It was] one of the most aggressive plans that I’ve ever been a part of in 23 years,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I think [defensive coordinator] Clancy [Pendergast] had every blitz in his entire package and used it, and these kids executed.”
The Trojans only got home for two sacks on quarterback Keller Chryst: Senior defensive tackle Josh Fatu notched the first in the third quarter, and senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu earned the second on Stanford’s final drive (redshirt sophomore linebacker John Houston Jr. recorded the lone quarterback hit of the night). 
Nevertheless, the pressure was enough. The Cardinal mustered just 211 yards on offense after the first quarter, while USC racked up 463. Stanford trailed by at least two possessions through the entire second half.
It was a remarkable turnaround, but the Trojans appeared nonplussed after the game. To them, they were merely making expected in-season adjustments.
“We were able to step it up and really just fix the little things … to play more assignment-sound this week,” junior linebacker Porter Gustin said. “I think that was the big difference.”
Indeed, Helton emphasized containing the ground attack, and Love only managed 58 more yards after his 102-yard outburst to begin the game. But while improved execution revealed the defense’s potential on Saturday, the long season will also require confidence and chemistry. USC believes it has both.
“I think we’re playing really well as a unit,” Smith said. “We answered some questions we needed for ourselves.”
Considering the Trojans seemed unconcerned after their win against Western Michigan, it seems those questions didn’t stem from Week 1. They were likely from last season, when the Cardinal dominated USC 27-10 and relegated then-starting quarterback Max Browne to the bench.
That game turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as it handed a redshirt freshman quarterback named Sam Darnold the keys to the Trojan offense. A year later, Darnold’s presence has now elevated USC into the national championship chase.
 For the defense, however, the game remained a thorny memory, especially as the last of three consecutive losses to Stanford. Saturday’s statement victory may have exorcised those demons.
“It took us a couple hard losses to get moving and preparing, and I think we learned from that last year,” Gustin said. “We’ve got guys in the film room hours on hours every single day because we don’t want to be in that situation again. To be able to get this win and see our preparation pay off is huge.”
With a confidence-building performance fresh in its mind, the defense now looks to carry over its success to the next grudge match, as the Trojans look to avenge their infamous loss to Texas in 2006 on Saturday. Crowd noise aided the defense against the Cardinal, and Helton urged fans to spur on the Trojan defense this weekend as well.
“Let’s get loud — we could feel it for the Stanford game, especially on third down,” Helton said. “We’ll lean on our Trojan Family once again for support.”
No. 4 USC kicks off against the Longhorns at 5:30 p.m. It is the first Coliseum sellout since 2013.

Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
Coming off of a statement 42-24 win against Stanford, the Trojans will look to continue their strong start to the season when Texas comes to town on Saturday. With an impressive performance against a competitive Pac-12 rival behind them, the Trojans stay at home for the third week in a row to take on another storied program. 
Scouting the Longhorns 
After losing in Week 1 to Maryland, Texas bounced back with a 56-0 beating of San Jose State. 
“This is a big football team and a talented football team that improved from Week 1 to Week 2,” head coach Clay Helton said.
 After hiring Tom Herman, one of the most prized coaches in college football, the Longhorns look to get back in the conversation of college football’s elite. Helton praised the Longhorns’ new hire. 
“I’ve also been ultra-impressed and respect coach Herman for a brilliant offensive mind,” Helton said. 
Herman has reloaded the Longhorns’ offense with Texas averaging 48 points a game. The Trojans will look to shut down the Longhorns’ run game after rushing for 406 yards against San Jose State.
The Longhorns’ quarterback situation is unclear, as sophomore quarterback Shane Buechele was injured in their opening game against Maryland. Playing in place of Buechele, freshman Sam Ehlinger performed well against San Jose State in their 56-0 win. Despite the lack of clarity on a starter, USC’s game plan will remain. 
“They’re really similar guys,” Helton said of the two quarterbacks. “They can both spin it. They have enough athleticism to move the chains, so I don’t think you have to have different game plans.” 
Defensively, USC will look to neutralize junior linebacker Malik Jefferson. 
”He plays in other people’s backfield,” Helton said. “He’s ultra-athletic, so it will be a challenge.”
Avoiding the Letdown
Many called the victory on Saturday the most complete win in Helton’s tenure at USC. The Trojans are satisfied with the win, but the coaching staff continues to stress the importance of fighting complacency. 
“Each week is like a blank slate to me,” Helton said. “I really liked the way they came out today and how they practiced. They’re here for a purpose. We talked about starting fast in September and this is that next step.” 
It’s a philosophy that helped USC get to the Rose Bowl last season and the staff hopes the same attitude will keep the Trojans focused on the now. Offensively, the Trojans look to continue the balanced attack that was successful against Stanford. Heading into the matchup, the Trojans are ranked fourth in the country while the Longhorns enter the game unranked. 
“I really think [Texas] is a sleeping giant,” Helton said. “We’re going to have to play our best game because it’s our next game.” 
One big advantage for the Trojans is that the game will be held in the friendly confines of the Coliseum. 
“Our fans in the first two games have been electric,” Helton said. “They’ve helped us in both games. Now there’s going to be even more fans, so it’s going to be a great atmosphere.” 
Injuries 
In their win on Saturday, the Trojans were a little dinged up. Junior linebacker Porter Gustin injured his shoulder and toe in the game, but played through pain. Gustin was held out of practice on Tuesday and he will be monitored as the week goes on. Junior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga fell awkwardly on his wrist in and will be reevaluated for Saturday.
Redshirt sophomore linebacker John Houston is also being evaluated after he suffered a “stinger” against Stanford and is experiencing neck stiffness. Helton said that the staff continues to hold out redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe, who has been fighting a nagging hip injury. Helton said he will not practice until he is back to 100 percent.

College football is subject to sudden shifts and changes by nature. In 2010, Auburn stormed its way to an undefeated national championship season on the shoulders of a junior college transfer named Cam Newton. Two years later, the Tigers finished 3-9 and the school fired Gene Chizik, the same head coach who led them to a title just 24 months prior. 
While not necessarily as extreme as what happened to Auburn, each team looks different from year to year as players leave for the NFL and others fill their roles. For the Trojans, this season’s biggest change is that sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold no longer has to be the focal point of the offense. That distinction belongs to running backs, junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr.  
When Carr entered campus as a five-star recruit in August, he started making waves in fall camp almost immediately. Coaches and teammates alike praised his vision and elusiveness as he continuously broke off long touchdown runs in live scrimmages, sometimes flipping the field if his original hole was clogged. Very quickly it became clear: An already solid backfield featuring Jones, junior Aca’Cedric Ware and redshirt freshman Vavae Malepeai was about to get even more crowded. 
In the first game of the season, Carr needed just seven carries to show the USC faithful what all the hype was about. He raced for 69 yards, including one dazzling 52-yard scamper where he sidestepped a Western Michigan defender straight into their Week 2 matchup with Stanford. 
Accompanying the star-making performance for Carr, was a bigger and stronger Jones who trucked his way toward 159 yards and three touchdowns, opening the game with a Marshawn Lynch-esque 29-yard rampage where he broke tackle after tackle. Whereas Darnold often struggled to find open receivers against the Broncos, the Trojan running backs seemed to find nothing but open space. 
Entering Week 2 against No. 14 Stanford, many were worried about how the Trojans would fare given their struggle to put Western Michigan away. The team came out with a clear game plan from the very first drive: Run the ball, and then run it some more. Offensive coordinator Tee Martin fed Jones the ball four times in a row on the Trojans’ first possession, and his ground-pound strategy never relented from that point. 
Collectively, the running back group rushed 45 times for 300 yards with both Jones and Carr topping over 100 yards. Jones did most of the dirty work, grinding in between holes for 3- to 4-yard gains, while Carr once again was the sparkplug. He ripped off another impressive 52-yard run.
USC has featured many talented running backs over the past decade, but this year’s two-headed monster has a chance to be the program’s best tandem since the “thunder and lightning” days of LenDale White and Reggie Bush. 
If the Trojans continue their string of dominance, it will not be long before they have their own collective nickname. The most important development from Jones and Carr’s success, however, is that Darnold no longer carries all of the weight of the offense on his shoulders.
Last year USC’s rushing attack was solid but inconsistent. The team finished fifth in the Pac-12 for rushing yards with 200.7 per game. However, the running game often faded away in big game situations. 
Against ranked opponents, the Trojans’ rushing yards per game dipped to 150, which meant that the offense tended to rely solely on Darnold’s arm in key situations (such as the Rose Bowl, when he had a season-high 53 pass attempts). While watching Darnold sling around the ball against marquee opponents will never get old, the Trojans need a more balanced attack in order to run the table this year. 
Jones and Carr’s success does not just alleviate some of the offensive pressure on Darnold; they can also help open up the passing game. With Stanford’s defense keyed in on the run, two of his four passing touchdowns came off the play action. When the running game was established early in the game, Darnold looked more settled than he did in his shaky start against Western Michigan, rattling off his first 10 throws for completions. 
The emergence of USC’s explosive running game does not necessarily mean that Darnold has to take a back seat in terms of the spotlight — after all, his 316-yard, four-touchdown performance against Stanford earned him Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. 
It does, however, mean Darnold has a larger margin for error as he develops chemistry with a burgeoning receiving corps and the pressure to win games no longer lies squarely on his shoulder. 
“I think we realized that in practice [what kind of player Stephen Carr is],” Darnold said after the Stanford game. “When you watch him run, he just has it,whatever it is. RoJo has it too.”

It is only fitting that the Secretary of Education selected by a president who once advocated for the sexual assault of women would roll back protections for sexual assault survivors. Indeed, Betsy DeVos’ announcement that she would revoke Title IX protections for sexual assault survivors implemented by the Obama administration sends the message that women will not be protected during the Trump administration.
It is true that the implementation of Obama-era guidelines is not flawless, and civil rights advocates must be honest about their need for reform. The preponderance of evidence standard — generally thought of as just over 50 percent confidence that what was alleged took place, which is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in the criminal court system — dictated to universities has been of particular controversy, even though universities are not courtrooms, and sexual assault is unique in that evidence is extremely difficult to procure. The lack of cross-examination and discovery make adjudication more difficult for both parties. It is still unclear whether the right against self-incrimination for the accused should be recognized. Sometimes, the blunt wielding of these rules can lead to absurd consequences.
But the Obama-era guidelines, coupled with Joe Biden’s “It’s On Us” campaign, still did a lot of good for students. They placed the burden on schools to take sexual assault allegations seriously and to impart justice on their students; they actively worked to dispel victim-blaming and myths about women crying rape; they created an impetus for campuses to hire Title IX coordinators to deal directly with the issue; it introduced the concept of affirmative consent, a “yes means yes” policy which encouraged better communication;  and they catalyzed campus activism on sexual assault. Biden’s personal involvement with the campaign — visiting colleges around the country, telling young men that sex without consent is rape — created a male role model for young men to act ethically.
Thus, although the adjudication process for campus sexual assault is imperfect, greater due process protections could be instituted without a wholesale rollback of the Title IX protections. With this rollback, much of the progress being made could be halted.
It is not a coincidence that, when it comes to campus sexual assault, President Donald Trump is suddenly interested in civil rights and due process. As Lucia Graves points out in The Guardian, “The sexually accused are overwhelmingly male, overwhelmingly white (57 percent, according to RAINN), and presumably, entitled. In other words, they are Trump’s core constituency to a T.”
Yet another example of Trump’s attempts to seek protections for white men, in order to appeal to white identity politics, the move is also an attempt to further the narrative of white, male victimhood. Laura Dunn writes in the Washington Post, “DeVos has positioned herself as the patron saint of those who claim, preposterously, that students being falsely accused of rape is just as prevalent and just as important a problem as students being raped.” And while due process and civil rights should be ensured for everyone, DeVos’ position speaks to a false equivalency between white, male oppression and the oppression of other groups, an equivalency which Trump’s administration and base have repeatedly invoked. 
Look no further than the Justice Department’s intentions to sue universities en masse for discriminating against white applicants in affirmative action admissions policies, while failing to devote resources to understanding the circumstances that created racial inequity to begin with. Yet, while Trump believes white college applicants deserve civil rights, he does not think the same for others; his campaign’s calls for police to manhandle suspects and his executive orders’ stripping due process from immigrants all signal that, when the affected parties are immigrants or suspects, the Trump administration is more than willing to overlook due process and civil rights.
Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in The Atlantic, “Trump has made the negation of Obama’s legacy the foundation of his own.” Just like his repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Trump’s revocation of Obama-era guidelines on sexual assault is continued evidence of his desire to undercut the accomplishments of the Obama administration.
Instead of accomplishing real progress, the move is almost certainly devoid of the nuance required to make campus sexual assault proceedings truly just to both parties. It works to increase the already pervasive perception that women who accuse men of rape are liars, and will likely discourage reporting. It fails to recognize that in many adjudication settings, rapists still have an upper hand, due to stigma, stereotypes and privilege. It may depress the sexual assault awareness and prevention activism that many campuses have seen over the past few years. Most tragically, it fails the young sexual assault survivors for whom Title IX protections were a shining light of hope.

Am I even allowed to talk about Title IX? I’m a male who isn’t particularly steeped in the history of sexual assault prevention and justice. I don’t have the wealth of knowledge that activists and scholars on this subject might possess; other matters of hot-button political debates pique my interest, but I’ve never had any real intellectual interest in Supreme Court cases or the nuts and bolts of federal law.
 Regardless, I’m an opinion columnist, which I guess allows me to write with one degree of authority on any public subject. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ proposed actions revoking Obama-era Title IX guidance in the department’s internal bureaucracy bring up a lot of interesting questions.
 To begin, my understanding is that the Obama administration’s Title IX guidelines did two things: They expanded the definition of sexual assault to a broader context than previously determined, and grated teeth to the existing class of enforcement officials employed by universities, expanding their authority and responsibilities with regard to prosecution.
 The enforcement is part of the policy that I don’t have any problem with. The expansion of the definition and treatment of sexual assault in court is a different matter. It’s probably justified in some regard, but when it expands to include whatever activities the Harvard Gender Studies Department wants it to include, or when it rejects the need for corroborating evidence other than the victim’s own testimony, it  starts to become shaky legal ground. I understand that the Obama-era regulations began to cover some of this territory.
 Under these circumstances, it was probably a near-certainty that the next time a Republican administration controlled the Department of Education, some kind of review of Title IX would occur, especially in the aftermath of such major flukes as the Rolling Stone scandal regarding its reporting of an alleged rape at the University of Virginia. Continuously high rates of sexual assault on campus demonstrate the need for a commitment to enforcement; but if the enforcement of sexual assault rules is done haphazardly and without deliberation, there looms over the awkward irony that a “War on Rape” could grow as haplessly institutionalized, bureaucratically straitjacketed, and socially unjust to large groups of people as the failed, ongoing “War on Drugs” of the late 20th century.
 For argument’s sake, I looked at The New York Times’ collection of opinion pieces from across the ideological spectrum — “Right and Left React to Betsy DeVos’ Changes to Campus Sex Assault Roles” — and noticed three things.
 First, the left-leaning opponents of DeVos’ proposed reforms — Lucia Graves at The Guardian and Christina Cauterucci at Slate — seemed to be more concerned with justice for victims of sexual assault than with overall due process for both the victims and the accused. They also highlight that President Donald Trump and his core constituents are privileged white males who presumably are not feminists, and that DeVos’ actions reviewing Obama-era policies are a form of white identity politics. I don’t believe either of these attitudes is wrong, but I do think both concerns sidestep DeVos’ stated purpose in pursuing these reforms: “ensuring that the intent of the law is actually carried out in a way that recognizes both the victim …  and those who are accused.” In other words, due process.
 Second, the right-leaning supporters of DeVos’ proposed reforms, National Review fellow David French and Ashe Schow in The Federalist, were predictably caustic and partisan on the topic. Both lambasted “junk science” and “sex bureaucracies” as being illiberal and un-American. Their support for the reforms seem as ideological — opposed to feminism and big government — as  they are practical.
 But most interestingly, the authors culled from the center all came out in skeptical, cautious support of DeVos’ eform efforts. Their skepticism and caution came from an acknowledgment of the concerns of those on the left; but overall, Emily Yoffe from The Atlantic; Christina Hoff Sommers in the Chronicle of Higher Education; Karol Markowicz in the New York Post; and Ruth Marcus in the Washington Post all agreed that the Obama-era regulations were cumbersome, top-heavy, and threatening to due process. There was also a consensus among the critics that it is necessary for Congress to issue guidelines of its own as to what Title IX actually means, so that true deliberation and modest discussion can be held.
 If the centrists are for DeVos’ reforms, albeit cautiously, there’s reason to believe that some good will come from them. I hope reasonable voices will prevail in the forthcoming debates over DeVos’ actions.

Strained family dynamics and gripping plot twists all wrapped into an American rock sequence — this is the unnerving yet uplifting musical Next to Normal. Written by Brian Yorkey and composed by Tom Kitt, this 2008 award-winning Broadway musical entertains audiences as it follows the highs and lows of a suburban family. This weekend, the USC Musical Theatre Repertory will present its own take of the production in the Massman Theatre, premiering on Friday. 
Next to Normal tells the story of a mother named Diana (portrayed by Maxine Phoenix, a senior majoring in critical studies and minoring in theatre) as she deals with her delusional bipolar depression. Throughout the course of the show, each family member attempts to find their own ways of coping with Diana’s deteriorating mental health. At its core, the show delves into what it means to be a normal family, especially in the face of mental illness. 
According to director Sean Soper, a junior majoring in business administration and minoring in theatre, the themes in Next to Normal can be difficult to relate to on paper; however, the creators succeeded in making the story relatable to all audiences. 
“They gave us this family that constantly struggled with new burdens layered on top of them, which we can all relate to,” Soper said. “They did a great job of examining that pressure, that struggle just to wake up in the morning and push through the day. We’re all just trying to find our own ways to get by.”
Next to Normal features a cast of six: theatre students Liz Buzbee, Michael Kaczkowski, Patrick Olsen, Harrison Poe, Luke Matthew Simon and Phoenix. Production of the show started in March, with rehearsals beginning in mid-August.
With this year’s new fall musical, the MTR Artistic Board wanted to give students more opportunities to be involved in other productions. Thus, MTR is holding an earlier premiere in mid-September rather than its usual late-October debut, giving the cast and crew only four weeks to prepare. 
The actors began rehearsing songs individually over the summer. Poe spent every day in the University Gateway practice rooms, listening to his recordings and sitting at the piano to “figure things out in advance,” as he knew playing the role of Gabe would be physically demanding. 
According to co-producer Sophie Thomason, the themes, small cast and resulting “higher caliber” performances — Phoenix’s character, for instance, performs over 20 numbers — make Next to Normal remarkably different from past MTR productions that she said were “dark comedy-centered or uplifting and heartfelt.”
“There’s not a show that’s had this much exposure that deals with the themes of mental illness,” Thomason said. “We’ve never done something so heavy and dense, but this show has the potential to move audiences in a much more tangible way than other shows have.”
Because of these nuances, Soper wanted to bring MTR’s own twists to the overall production. After planning and sorting out production details, he decided to integrate weather imagery into different scenes, changing the show’s signature purple color palette to bluer hues. Sets were also redesigned from scratch and the production will showcase more ensemble choreography and more vivid movements. 
However, the most notable distinction for this MTR production is its cast. Since the roles are so iconic based on the Broadway actors’ portrayals, audiences may already have a set perception of the characters. During one rehearsal, Soper told the actors that if they looked around the room, all of them were very different from those on Broadway. 
“We don’t want to be a replica of Broadway,” Soper said. “Our actors’ representation of the roles is so different from the way they are typically portrayed, and I’ve been waiting for the audience’s reactions to our actors and their styles ever since we found these six guys.”
For instance, Aaron Tveit, who originated the role of Gabe, played the role as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed teenage hunk. Although Poe’s interpretation shares several similarities with Tveit’s, Poe wanted to portray Gabe in a more relatable light.
“Aaron Tveit kind of plays it like this sexy, almost edible bad boy, and I think my take on the character trying to be this perfect son who’s always there for Diana and less of the image of what society thinks is the perfect son,” Poe said. 
For co-producer Sarah Hahm, it proves to be a challenge to divert from the usual standards people have for Next to Normal. In casting a family of two middle-aged adults and two teenagers from a pool of college students, Hahm and the rest of the casting team found that they needed to construct a family that was believable in maturity and age. Therefore, they stuck to the very principles of the characters while casting.
“We’re not casting Alice Ripley [who originated the role of Diana], and our Diana may not look like Ripley, sound like Ripley or have the same kind of energy, but she’s our Diana,” Hahm said. “That’s the beauty of musical theatre: You see so many types of people play these characters in a different way, but they still come across clearly.”
With the production deviating from being a carbon copy of the Broadway version, Soper is ecstatic to see  to the audience experiencing a fresh new take on the musical. Since the show is already embedded with secrets and plot twists, Soper believes people’s expectations of Next to Normal will change after viewing the production this weekend.
“By having that new spin, people are going to be surprised just from the first moment,” Soper said. “They’ll forget about the secrets so that when they’re revealed, they’ll be hit twice as hard.”

I have faithfully embodied the trademark characteristics of a Type A personality for as long as I can remember. I have an unending to-do list on my laptop; I am easily impassioned and emotional; I don’t find relaxation as appealing as being busy; and I am prone to worry and stress. Some of these traits are symptoms of an upbringing by immigrant parents and taking after my conscientious father, I am hyper-organized and programmed to plan ahead. My most enduring and defining trope is that I am obsessed with formulating and executing plans — in life, in relationships, in my career. 
Now don’t get me wrong — I have no issue with the way I’m wired as a perfectionist. Even though I live my life around the clock and am perpetually worried about the little things, being Type A has made me a career-driven go-getter with a clear vision for my future and a creatively analytical mind. 
At 7 years old, the plan was to read every book from the meticulously curated list I harbored in my journal, imitate my favorites and become a best-selling novelist. As a high school freshman, the plan was to ascend to mock trial team captain, make the tennis team, obtain Ivy League degrees in English and law and live the illustrious life of a modern woman in a big city. 
The plan is fluid, ever-changing, increasingly detailed with every revision, but always there. But in all its cliched glory, here’s the thing: Life happens. 
I grew up to realize I needed more than just a love for books to become a famous novelist. I made the track team instead of tennis and took an introduction to journalism class on a whim, which catapulted me deep into a field I now love. I came to the sobering conclusion that an English degree would be too limiting for my ambitions. I was rejected from my dream universities, but wound up here after a semester-long stint in Paris that I wouldn’t trade for anything. 
It wasn’t until recently, in the throes of one of my weekly existential crises, that I began to question the plan. Not its content, but its very essence. It’s omnipresence. Why has the plan always been such a vehement constant in my life? What’s the point of letting my life be dictated by the promise of unrealistic ideals? 
Honestly, I don’t have an answer. Other than providing an artificial sense of security and housing my wildly misguided optimism that my life will play out exactly as I envision it, the plan has mainly yielded disappointment, no matter how diligently I refine and believe in it. But I do know that the plan is far too twisted, elusive and inherently flawed for me to ever harvest genuine happiness from it.
I have 19 years worth of proof that the plan seldom becomes reality. And in spite of all its shortcomings, I am here and I am happy. Having a plan falsely led me to believe that the circumstances of my life are within my control but every time the plan has failed, everything has worked out in my favor regardless.
So, to keep it PG, screw the plan. Thanks to advice from adults far wiser than me, my exceedingly Type B boyfriend and some inspirational TED talks, I’m done trying to plan life — done strategizing a guaranteed path to happiness because no such path exists. Life is too chaotic, unpredictable and beautiful to tame or mold to fit my quixotic mindset. Rather than agonizing over the nuances of circumstances outside my control, I will focus on appreciating everything I have now and trusting in the greater scope of things. And, trite as it may sound, I’m going to enjoy the little moments day by day and stop to smell the roses.
I’m not going to beat myself up about dropping out of the business minor I planned to pursue. I’m not going to dwell on that internship I didn’t get. I’m not going to prioritize my professional pursuits and my foolish attempts to forge the perfect future ahead of my mental well-being. I’m not going to capitulate to my perfectionist instincts that constantly tell me I’m not good enough because I’m not perfect. 
Right now, the plan is to close my laptop and get to bed — because frankly, it’s enough for this column to be done than for it to be perfect.

Few bands are able to maintain a high level of respect from their peers, critics and fans for as long as the The National has. The release of its seventh studio album, Sleep Well Beast, comes at a pivotal, albeit confusing, phase for the band. The project is a breath of fresh air for a group has thrived off of its guitar-heavy melancholia for 18 years, despite sharing less time in the studio together.
While The National’s  popularity has continued to grow, each member has spent much of his time since 2013’s Trouble Will Find Me exploring his own work. In the meantime, principal songwriter Aaron Dessner collaborated with frontman Matt Berninger, known for his lyrical obscurity in past projects. The product is a record that feels every bit as grand, complex and emotive as the Cincinnati indie rockers’ devoted following desires.
Sleep Well Beast observes the melancholy rock giants comfortably atop their throne. Bands that develop an emotionally gripping sound over seven albums rarely hear their music described as “fresh,” but Dessner’s incorporation of modern sounds earns this description. The album’s heavy use of electronic instruments aids in The National’s innovation. Synthesizers, electric guitars and drum kits provide the album with a focus not typical of the band’s previous projects.
Berninger distinguishes himself from his traditional influences like The Smiths, Joy Division and Nick Cave. He has a tendency to sound more reserved than Morrissey, but his personality appears to open up on this record. Berninger again switches between his typical personas of the solemn scholar and the unruly dinner guest. However, this project sees Berninger unafraid to be vulnerable as he fully embraces his emotions. This change is not a new persona, but rather an observation of existing ones unhinged.

The album’s second track “Day I Die” brings the sophistication and introspection from the best of Boxer and Trouble Will Find Me to arena rock. Dessner’s investment in electric guitars pays off as his piercing chords trade blows with Beringer’s inspired vocals. The increased tempo and tightened drum arrangements give energy to an otherwise somber song. “Guilty Party” is another wistful effort that benefits from these sped-up arrangements. This track has less of the arena-rock appeal of other album cuts and it sounds like it would fit well within their early work.
“The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness” is as wintery and serious of a first single as it is radio-friendly. The song is a testament to Dessner’s versatility as a producer, as it seamlessly shifts between bass drums suited for an indie film soundtrack and stadium-rocking guitar solos. It’s fairly easy to understand why this track was selected to be the lead single — it’s monumental. Berninger croons with his typical baritone to build up the weight of the song’s bridges before unleashing his upper register during the chorus. Above all, the stellar track unveils an indisputable truth: The National knows how to play with listeners’ emotions.
In many ways, Sleep Well Beast is not the product of musical veterans that feel obligated to be especially experimental or curious. The National is much more confident in its longevity. This confidence has alleviated many pressures, and Sleep Well Beast is a product of this relief. Berninger is a frontman who has only recently tapped into the true value of his vulnerability, while Dessner’s confidence pours over into his experimentation in the studio. The National is a band with nothing left to prove, but this project proves that it is a band with everything to explore.

Over 2,500 miles away from Tropical Storm Irma’s center, the majority of USC students feel distant from the impact of the storm. Yet for some Trojans hailing from affected territories including Florida and some Caribbean islands, the storm hits home, causing concern as it makes its way toward family and friends.
Irma tore through the Caribbean last week before hitting the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm early Sunday and moving up Florida’s southwest coast, making landfall again near Marco Island. On Monday morning, Irma weakened to a tropical storm, although the National Weather Service warned rain and tropical storm conditions could affect parts of Florida, Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina through Wednesday. 
For Ana Rescala, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science, hurricanes have been a concern. Her younger sister, Paula, is a freshman at Rice University in Houston, Texas, where classes were canceled the week of Aug. 28 due to Hurricane Harvey.
Less than two weeks later, her parents were under mandatory evacuation orders to leave their home in Tampa, Fla., as Irma’s path tracked directly toward the city.
“Especially as the one outsider of the entire family, I know my parents are safe, but I’m a little concerned about Tampa right now,” Rescala said. “We haven’t experienced anything this bad, at least not in my lifetime. So I don’t know what to expect.”
Professor Julien Emile-Geay, an expert on climate change in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said that despite the common perception, hurricanes like Irma are actually an expected event. 
“The remarkable thing is, for hurricanes, like all weather phenomena, their function is to even out energy,” Emile-Geay said. “Turns out there’s about 90 tropical storms per year worldwide, and that number is amazingly constant, which makes climatologists think that [hurricanes are] kind of like a vent to get energy out of the ocean, into the atmosphere and eventually out to space.”
What is rare, Emile-Geay said, is not a hurricane but rather a hurricane that makes landfall. A storm’s starting point is unpredictable, unlike the prediction capabilities available after it has formed. Most hurricanes occur in open water, going largely unnoticed. 
However, in the last month, hurricanes have made their way into the American psyche, after both Irma and Hurricane Harvey made landfall.
Like Rescala, Brennen Lopez, a freshman majoring in business administration, thinks Irma is distinct from the other storms he’s seen hit his hometown of Miami. Although Irma didn’t cause any lasting damage to his family or home, Lopez said the experience was still surreal.
“[My parents] were pretty calm about getting prepared for it … so it wasn’t like a huge deal,” Lopez said. “[But] I’m not used to asking my parents like, ‘Hey, how’s the hurricane going.’ So that’s still a little freakish to me.”
While Lopez admits the idea sounds unreasonable, if his class schedule and parents would’ve permitted it, he would have flown to be with his family when Irma hit. Although his parents kept him updated, spotty cell service and power outages in Miami made it difficult to stay in contact from Los Angeles.
“I haven’t heard from my parents in probably six hours [right now],” Lopez said. “All of my friends here are like, ‘Hey, is your family OK?’ and I’m like ‘Oh yeah, yeah, yeah’ but in actuality I’m just hoping that nothing’s happening.”
Lynette Merriman, the associate vice provost for Campus Support and Intervention, is leading USC’s outreach for Irma. Her office has emailed students whose hometowns may have been affected and is aware of students’ possible concerns following natural disasters. 
“A student’s experience [can be challenging] … their anxiety, their stress, feeling that they weren’t there and the rest of their family had to go through it,”  Merriman said. “So one of the things we do is help connect them with crisis counselors to help them process the event.”
Additionally, if a natural disaster causes financial hardship, Merriman’s office will connect the student to the financial aid office, which can offer support. 
And for those not personally affected, but worried about possible future storms, Emile-Geay warns hurricanes like Harvey and Irma may become increasingly common. Climatologists can’t tell if climate change will mean more hurricanes making landfall, but know it will change the hurricanes themselves.
“We know that they [storms] are going to have to be overall carrying more energy,” Emile-Geay said. “So either you’ll have more storms of the same intensity or you’ll have maybe even fewer storms but individual storms will be bigger and stronger.”
Emile-Geay urges those with concern to take action, not wait for the next Irma to strike.
“There are a lot of people who don’t want to take any action on climate change because it’s a change in their lifestyle,” Emile-Geay said. “And what I like to tell people is a hurricane is a pretty big change in lifestyle.”
To help slow climate change, Emile-Geay suggests limiting one’s carbon footprint and pressing the government to take action. Little changes now can help prevent the next disaster.
“The people whose lives have been flattened by a hurricane can tell you that that’s a pretty serious change in lifestyle,” Emile-Geay said. “So are you willing to give up your planet or your car?”

Kyle Kawaguchi | Daily Trojan
On Tuesday night, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted a naming celebration for its newly minted debate space, the Sheindlin Forum. Housed within Wallis Annenberg Hall, the forum is named for Judge Judith Sheindlin and her husband, Jerry Sheindlin, both of whom were present for the ceremony. 
Annenberg Dean Willow Bay opened the event by introducing Sheindlin, popularly known as Judge Judy, the star of the Emmy Award-winning show.
Bay thanked the Sheindlin family for the generous gift, noting that the forum would not only create a dedicated space for the Trojan Debate Squad, but also encourage students to engage in civil discourse through a new Annenberg Debate Series and the Sheindlin Debate Fellowship to support graduate students pursuing public advocacy.
“Universities have a unique opportunity and distinct responsibility to encourage this civil exchange of ideas,” Bay said. “There is no better place than Annenberg to create rigorous and informed debate.”
As she took the podium, Sheindlin presented her perspective on the importance of respectful debate by drawing parallels between disagreement in the public sphere and differences in entertainment preferences.
She emphatically noted that using violence and intimidation to prevent healthy debate because of ideological differences was not a productive solution.
“Some [viewers] agree with me and some don’t, but no one is going to come into your home and rip your TV off the wall simply because they don’t agree with me,” Sheindlin said.
Sheindlin specifically selected Annenberg to receive her gift because of her belief that it must set a standard for the rest of the country. Saying she was shocked by recent instances of students preventing speakers from sharing their ideas at university campuses, Sheindlin took it upon herself to designate the forum as a place for civilized debate.
“What will destroy the spirit of this country is fear of expressing an opinion that is different,” Sheindlin said. “What will destroy this country is the death of civilized discourse.”
The judge and television star ultimately encouraged her audience members to hold themselves to a higher standard of discourse and critical thinking.
“A closed mind is a small mind, and Annenberg doesn’t produce small-minded people,” Sheindlin said.
Sheindlin then turned the microphone over to Gordon Stables, professor of communication and former director of the Trojan Debate Squad, who stressed the importance of respectful dialogue.
He kicked off the Annenberg Debate Series by moderating a discussion between Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jeremy Philips, general partner at Spark Capital, about the future of regulating online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.
While Soltani advocated for reframing the perception of information and privacy in the digital age to build better policies, Philips argued for free speech and insisted that consumer education and competition between major corporations will hold institutions accountable for respecting user data.
The ceremony and debate were followed by a reception attended by Provost Michael Quick, who echoed Sheindlin’s hope for the future of constructive discourse.
“The way we go forth in this world is to rigorously debate and do so in a civil manner,” Quick said.
