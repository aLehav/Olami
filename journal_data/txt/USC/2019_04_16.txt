Over the weekend, the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books descended upon the USC campus, lining Trousdale Parkway with a parade of white tents. It was a heartening sight: Attendees of all ages came together to celebrate the power of the written word, proving that print, while perhaps on its last legs, is not dead yet. 
As a book columnist, I consider the Festival of Books my personal paradise. I was like a kid in a candy shop. Before I headed over to the festival, I gave myself a stern talking-to; I would only allow myself to pick up one or two new books, and anything else that caught my eye I would check out from the public library. And no trinkets!
Needless to say, by the time the festival ended, I was the proud owner of four new books, a couple of cute cat pins and a marimekko-print pencil bag. Here are some books I haven’t read yet but am very, very excited to get started on:
“Dreyer’s English: An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style” 
I won’t lie; I really enjoy books about how to write. I’ve read both Strunk and White’s “The Elements of Style” and John McPhee’s “Draft No. 4: On the Writing Process” purely recreationally. I realize not everyone shares my proclivities, but even the most reluctant English student should have fun with “Dreyer’s English,” written by Benjamin Dreyer, the vice president, executive managing editor and copy chief of Random House. Dreyer peppers his grammar guide with witticisms and funny anecdotes. I’m not sure if this says more about me or him, but I can’t wait for him to lecture me more on the Oxford comma.  
“Chemistry”
The cover of Weike Wang’s “Chemistry” demanded my attention — it was a bright, buttercup yellow, featuring the universal restroom symbol for “female” with an atomic structure hovering around her head. “Chemistry” follows a 20-something Chinese American student working toward her Ph.D. in chemistry at a prestigious university in Boston, while simultaneously grappling with whether or not she should accept her boyfriend’s marriage proposal. I have no desire to go to grad school, nor am I planning on announcing my engagement anytime soon. But what captured my interest was the description of the narrator’s attempt to live life on her own terms, rather than on her immigrant parents’ — and I’m still working on that. 
“Normal People” 
On the Los Angeles Public Library website, 215 people, including me, have placed a hold on an e-book copy of Sally Rooney’s “Normal People.” So when I saw the physical books on display, I figured I might as well grab one, unless I wanted to wait until 2020 to finally read it. Rooney is what one might call a prodigy. At the tender age of 28, she has already published two novels, and her first, “Conversations with Friends,” was lauded as critics and audiences everywhere. It’s only April, and Vox just called “Normal People” “the book of the year.” Whether it’ll live up to the hype remains to be seen, but I have a sneaking suspicion it will. 
“The New Me”
The New Yorker staff writer Jia Tolentino is my #girlcrush, and when she published a review of Halle Butler’s “The New Me,” I knew it was more a question of when rather than if I would read the book. “The New Me” follows 30-year-old protagonist Millie, who bounces from temp job to temp job and struggles to find stability, fulfillment, meaning  — all the things that she was promised growing up. I’m no stranger to office novels — two books I’ve written about for this column in the past, “Adult Gummies” and “Severance,” both followed disaffected millennial women whose soul and spirits were slowly sapped by the artificial contrivances endemic among the white-collar workers. But since I’ve only got one more year in college before I, too, enter the workforce for the next 50 years of my life, I figure I should be as prepared as possible.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti came under fire at the end of March for attending a Lyft event when, just a few days earlier, Lyft and Uber drivers were striking for better wages and treatment by their companies. According to the Los Angeles Times, drivers for both companies consider their rates “untenable” — especially for living in a city as costly as L.A. As these strikes continue, USC should reconsider its involvement with Lyft, a company that many drivers and their union Rideshare Drivers United believe do not pay a living wage. 
While USC’s Safe Rides collaboration with Lyft is valuable for students, USC should not partner with a company that does not properly compensate its own workers. Instead, the University should focus efforts on improving its own internal rideshare program, Campus Cruiser.
USC used to have a contract with Uber for its Safe Rides program, but the partnership was discontinued before Fall 2017, following the resignation of former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick amid accusations of discrimination and mismanagement of sexual harassment cases throughout the company. London canceled Uber’s contracts to operate in the city. USC was right to discontinue its partnership with Uber, and it should consider doing the same with Lyft. 
While Lyft’s corporate suite has not been plagued with the same scandals, some employees have reported mistreatment and unlivable wages. The Times reported that one driver was forced into homelessness due to the low pay: “His earnings on Lyft aren’t always enough to cover that fee in addition to the $240 weekly payment for the car and the cost of gas.” USC should not continue to contract with a company that doesn’t fairly compensate its employees.
Exclusively providing Campus Cruiser could help make late night rides safer for students. Earlier this month at the University of South Carolina, a student was kidnapped and murdered by her Uber driver while trying to get home from a bar near campus. While Lyft claims to have a more thorough background checking system than Uber, ABC San Francisco reported that that same day, a Lyft driver followed a student from his car to her front door and inappropriately touched her. 
In a statement from Lyft, the company claimed that the man “fraudulently represented himself.” This ordeal revealed that even with background checks, there could still be circumstances that compromise passenger safety. If USC were to make the Safe Rides program an internal effort, it could help ensure the safety of students, as the University would take direct responsibility to properly vet its drivers.
Increased Campus Cruiser usage would also help students find jobs on campus. Students could also be more easily vetted than Lyft drivers, as USC has already had to verify students’ status to admit them. This would also increase the University’s direct involvement in the safety of its students. The University could ensure that they are hiring safe and responsible drivers, rather than trusting a third party to run background checks and ensure the safety of its students.
If USC saw more demand for Campus Cruiser than student workers could fulfill, USC could also use this opportunity to hire more Campus Cruiser drivers from the community. These additional drivers could also help lighten the load for student workers during the week so they won’t drive late nights during the semester.
Throughout numerous press releases during the construction of USC Village, the University said it was committed to hiring people from the surrounding community to work on campus. USC could take the money it spends on the Lyft partnership and use it to pay living wages to people in the areas around USC. A Campus Cruiser expansion would reaffirm USC’s commitment to supporting the local community, while also ensuring that its students get home safe every day.

“A Stone Is Nobody’s,” the second show in the School of Dramatic Arts’ New Works Festival, premiered Friday and ran through the weekend at Massman Theatre. The play, set in an untethered time and place gracefully toeing the line between the real and the imagined, told a story of growing up, letting go and choosing to stay through the lens of a family’s tragic struggle for love.
As the lights dimmed and the play began, the quiet calm was replaced by a violent storm, an intense flash of white light and a cacophony that gave way to a haunting silence, foreshadowing the tumultuous tale the characters — and the audience — were about to experience. 
Sophomore theatre major Santiago Gavidia, who portrayed the main character Gently, said the relationship between Gently and his mother Luella was abusive and remained the show’s main source of tension. 
Noa Gardner, the show’s playwright and a theatre MFA student, worked closely alongside the actors and director Cara Phipps to refine his work in a process cast members said was extremely flexible and collaborative.
“As we evolved in our process, and as Noa evolved in his process, I think we found a little more love for Luella and slowly that character become more complex,” Gavidia said.
Luella’s complexity was evident in the family’s tense and erratic dynamics, emphasized further by the family’s only friend, Davina — portrayed by freshman theatre major Fiona Baquerizo — who acted both as a comic relief  and as a grounding force that ultimately kept the family together. Brought to their breaking points multiple times throughout the play, the characters never give up on each other, even when they seem trapped in a loveless cycle of possession and resentment.
“Often times we are abusive to those we are closest to and those we love the most because there’s fear,” Gavidia said. “Fear of letting go, past fear, trauma. Dealing with that is complex.” 
The plot of the play spans many years, as evidenced by Gavidia’s growth from a young boy to a young man throughout the show. Gavidia’s aging was the only real indication that time was passing, and his ability to walk offstage as one age and emerge moments later as an older version of himself helped the audience’s understanding of the story. 
Several of the cast members were also tasked with particularly difficult roles as members of the chorus. Assuming roles that included young girls, fishermen, elders and pregnant women, the chorus transitioned effortlessly between ages and genders to create the characters’ complex world. 
The demand for actors to play many different roles, paired with moments that deliberately push the parameters of reality through distinct lighting changes, contributed to the show’s folklore, as Baquerizo put it. The simple re-configurations of set pieces — a quilt on the kitchen table to signify a bed or an upside-down table and a few chairs to create a fishing boat — conveyed different locations, as well as the consistent miming of props, added to a world of both simplicity and fantasy.
“Just like how our world came to be and how we’ve come to be,” Baquerizo said. “And this question of age and time, is the setting imagined? It’s real, but when is it? Where is it? It was created.” 
The play breaks the convention of miming props in the final scene in which Gently and Luella sit down at the kitchen table and eat a grilled cheese sandwich with soup. This hauntingly simple moment, which deliberately lasts an uncomfortable amount of time, harkens back to the opening scene, where a young Gently asks his mother for a grilled cheese sandwich and she “makes” him one, which is, in reality, an empty plate that he “eats” off of. 
Luella continuously rejects the idea that people need to eat to survive. The lack of food in their home mirrors the absence of love.
Although mother and son push and pull against each other and external forces — paralleling the sound design of waves crashing against the shore before being pulled back to sea — at the end of the day, there is just the two of them sitting at a table, breaking the cycle, finally expressing their love for one another.

As 8 p.m. steadily approached, I downed my last shot of vodka and took off from the campsite. It was dark now and the air was rapidly cooling, but I still went forward, undeterred. I was about to witness history. Crowds of people surged around me, some in my direction, others heading to different acts in what I can only describe as a bad decision. There was quite a lot of overlap at this period of time; The 1975 was playing at the Coachella Stage, as was Ella Mai at the Outdoor Theatre. But neither of these acts were comparable to what I was about to see. As I neared the massive stage at the Sahara Tent, I heard the screams of the crowd unmistakably announcing the start of what was to be the first set by a female Korean pop group at Coachella. I broke into a full sprint — I couldn’t miss this. 
Entering the crowd, I arrived just in time to see the four members of BLACKPINK announce their arrival with a performance of one of their most recognizable hits — “DDU DU DDU DU.” I screamed. Everyone around me screamed. A fellow Asian guy in front turned to me and asked, “Who’s your favorite?” 
I couldn’t say. I don’t know any of their names. 
K-pop’s rise has been an overnight phenomenon. Growing up, I never described myself as a big K-pop fan. I’ve known a few big hits here and there from groups like SNSD. But I still stuck primarily to my comfort zone, listening to easy pop songs you could sing along to at talent shows — “If You Seek Amy” by Britney Spears, for example. I believed that K-pop would just be a genre of music confined to its native country, never reaching international prominence American pop music did. 
Boy, was I wrong. K-pop has not only broken out of South Korea, but it has also become a full-blown global sensation. Spearheading this revolution are groups like BTS and BLACKPINK, which have cultivated online fandoms surpassing acts like Ariana Grande and One Direction. The numbers don’t lie — BLACKPINK recently broke the record for most watched YouTube video in 24 hours (previously held by Grande’s “Thank U, Next”), with its “Kill this Love” video. BLACKPINK has also surpassed One Direction as the musical group with the most followers on Instagram — 17.1 million — compared to One Direction’s 17. 
The girls’ historic Coachella performance was live-streamed in Times Square. Social media analytics firm Crimson Hexagon discovered that BLACKPINK’s online presence during Coachella was 10 times that of Childish Gambino, who holds second place, and more than 20 times that of Grande. BLACKPINK seems unstoppable at this point.
But what really drew me to their Coachella set wasn’t the fact that they’re quite literally dominating the world. A K-pop group, whose music is primarily in Korean, breaking into the mainstream on such an astronomical level is something I never thought I would live to see. In addition to BLACKPINK, Perfume, a Japanese pop group, also made history as the first J-pop group to perform at Coachella. 
Asian pop is no longer on the backburner to American pop, and is no longer a niche genre of music only popular among Asians and weeaboos (a western person obsessed with East Asian culture, usually Japanese). Standing in that Coachella crowd, seeing thousands of people dancing to their music, gave me the exact same feeling I had when I watched “Crazy Rich Asians” for the first time. Or when I saw Sandra Oh cry as she thanked her parents during her Golden Globe acceptance speech for “Killing Eve.” Or even when I first watched “Kill Bill” and saw Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii in what was my first time seeing an Asian American in a leading role.
To me, BLACKPINK’s achievement is a sign of progress and acceptance. It was one small step for BLACKPINK, and one giant leap for Asiankind.

Bill Plaschke’s journalism career ironically began as a way to deal with his stutter. When the Louisville native was a freshman at a high school where he didn’t know anybody, Plaschke used his love of sports to make an impression on his fellow students by writing a story about the beloved 12th man on the basketball team, a fellow freshman named Earl.
“I couldn’t really communicate except through writing back then,” Plaschke said. “People came up to me and said, ‘Thank you for telling us about Earl, we heard people cheering for him and we didn’t know about him.’ I realized that by bringing this guy out of the shadows and into people’s lives, I was able to make a difference.”
Plaschke’s career is full of accolades — he has been recognized as the Associated Press columnist of the year seven times for his work at the Los Angeles Times — but he still carries with him a love for telling the stories of forgotten members of society. He attained this penchant during his time as a student at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, where he lived in a church basement next to an oil refinery because he had so little money.
“People wonder why I do so many human interest stories about off-beat sports — that’s all we had,” Plaschke said, referencing stories he wrote about a foreign javelin thrower and a pregnant homecoming queen. “That type of humanity, that’s what SIU-Edwardsville was all about.”
Arash Markazi, a fellow L.A. Times sports columnist who grew up reading Plaschke, noted the humanity of Plaschke’s work.
“There are times where sports are a way into telling a story about life,” Markazi said. “Bill does a great job of not just giving his opinion on what’s happening, but also showing the human side of the game as well.”
Plaschke’s love for people’s stories grew when he moved to Los Angeles. Since joining the Times to cover the Dodgers in 1987, Plaschke has become a spokesman of sorts for the city, holding any sports figure accountable when he feels they have disrespected the City of Angels.
“I love when people say they want to be the voice of a city,” Plaschke said. “People misinterpret when I’m ripping on the Dodgers or Lakers, saying ‘Oh, you’re an L.A. hater.’ No, I’m an L.A. lover, and they’re making the city look bad.”
Markazi added that Plaschke’s presence in the city can transcend the topic of sports.
“His column is not just on the front page of the sports section, it’s on the front page of the actual paper,” he said. “That speaks to him being here for as long as he has been and cultivating his voice that speaks what Los Angeles is thinking.”
Plaschke often infuses his own emotions into sports stories, which can lead to him taking stances that can be unpopular among his readers. For example, Plaschke referenced his disdain for former Dodger Yasiel Puig as a take for which he received plenty of criticism. But these negative responses can cover up the fact the Plaschke truly wants to write about the positive side of sports.
“Winning is better for the city, obviously, and it’s better for the newspaper,” he said. “People think I thrive on the negative, but it’s just the opposite: I want the positive.”
That being said, Plaschke said he prioritizes the responsibility he feels to the reader to call it how he sees it.
“You have to be honest with the reader because they trust you,” Plaschke said. “That’s what’s so sacred to me in this business. They have to trust that you’re being objective.”
Plaschke added that this relationship with readers is where he derives the most enjoyment from his work.
“The best award I’ve ever won is when someone emails me, texts me, tweets at me and says ‘Hey, thanks for writing this story, you said what I was thinking,’ or ‘My dad and I shared your story today’ or ‘We grew up reading you,’” he said. “Those are the things that really matter to me.”
Plaschke said the ultimate goal of his work is to cause a reaction, whether it be positive or negative.
“If you want to get mad at me, go ahead and get mad at me,” he said. “I love that you feel something. When I’m able to make people feel something I am very blessed, and that’s pretty much my whole reason for doing this.”

The No. 2 USC women’s water polo team achieved a decisive 17-3 victory over No. 10 Arizona State Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center, improving its record to 22-1 overall and 4-1 in conference play.
Saturday’s game snapped a two-game winning streak for the visiting Sun Devils, who now sit at 12-10 overall and 1-3 against MPSF competitors. Arizona State also lost to USC earlier this season at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational by a score of 7-1.
In contrast, the Trojans appear to be gaining momentum since their narrow loss to Stanford two weeks ago. Their dominant performances these past two weekends, including last weekend’s 8-3 win against Cal, are promising for a team looking to bring home another championship.
As Saturday was Senior Day, it was fitting that senior driver Courtney Fahey made some big plays for her team early on. Fahey drew an exclusion to open up the scoring for the Trojans, who surged to a 5-1 lead by the end of the first period. After the Trojans scored 3 more unanswered goals in the second period, the game seemed all but over heading into the final two frames.
The Sun Devils simply had no answer for the Trojan offense. While Arizona State’s defense conceded just 6.90 goals per game entering Saturday’s match, the Trojans quickly surpassed this mark. Nine different Trojans contributed at least 1 goal, while five Trojans had multiple-goal performances. Junior utility Maud Megens led the charge with 4 goals, while junior driver Kelsey McIntosh put up 3.
Along with maintaining offensive command from the start, the Trojans held strong on defense. While Arizona State was averaging 9.71 goals per game coming into Saturday’s game, the Trojans held the Sun Devils to just 3. Senior goalie Amanda Longan played a crucial role in shutting down the Arizona State offense with 10 important saves.
The Trojans’ dominance on Saturday was fueled not only by its starters and veteran players, but by its young talent. Redshirt sophomore goalie Holly Parker entered the game for the final six minutes of play, giving up only a single goal while making three huge saves. Meanwhile, sophomore driver Verica Bakoc and freshman utility Bayley Weber added 2 goals apiece to the Trojan total.
The team’s more experienced players, including Fahey and Longan, have been essential in guiding these younger players through the end of the regular season. After the mid-season departure of head coach Jovan Vavic last month due to his alleged involvement in the admissions scandal, their leadership has been integral to the team’s continued success.
“Each and every one of the girls stepped up into a role that they had to play to help us move forward,” said freshman two-meter Tilly Kearns in a video released by USC Athletics prior to the Stanford game, just two weeks after Vavic’s departure.
For the 22-1 Trojans, moving forward means pursuing a seventh national championship. Each upcoming contest is an opportunity for the team to improve against conference opponents that they may meet again in next month’s NCAA tournament.
The Trojans will travel across town to Spieker Aquatics Center to take on rival UCLA Saturday at 4 p.m. This will be the Trojans’ final regular season game before they vie for the MPSF championship the following week.

The Trojans started strong on the road in Salt Lake City, but they were unable to maintain their good form and lost the final two games of the series to Utah. With the series now behind them, the Trojans are 14-20 on the year.
Junior pitcher Connor Lunn started on the mound for the Trojans in their 6-0 victory in Thursday night’s opener and looked as commanding as ever. In six innings, Lunn hurled nine strikeouts while allowing only one hit and no earned runs.
“I was really able to introduce my new curveball that I’ve been working on,” Lunn said to USC Athletics. “I was able to get some swings and misses on that, and it helped my fastball a little bit.”
This marks three consecutive wins for Lunn, who started the season as the Trojan’s go-to closer late in the game. With some pitching struggles earlier in the year, there was an opening for someone to take the No. 1 pitching spot in the Trojan rotation, and Lunn has flourished in the role. He is 5-1 on the year and has some impressive victories against teams like UCLA and Arizona State.
However, Lunn was assisted by some hot Trojan hitting Thursday. Six players had multiple hits and the team accounted for 16 total for the game.
“It really gives me a lot of positive energy pitching,” Lunn said. “Knowing that they are going to pick me [up] and that all I need to focus on is what I need to do and just get it done.”
Specifically, sophomore right fielder Jamal O’Guinn couldn’t miss in the series opener. He went 4-for-5 in the game and contributed three RBIs.
“When I go up there, my thing is just get the next guy up and help the team out as much as I can,” O’Guinn told the Pac-12 Network. “So my thing is just get them over and get somebody else an RBI and go from there.”
However, the Trojans couldn’t replicate their lights out performance against the Utes in the following two games of the series.
In the second game in Salt Lake City, the Trojans lost by a narrow 5-4 margin.
Utah took an early 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning. The Utes then added another run in the bottom of the fourth before the Trojans tied the game at 2 runs apiece in the top of the fifth inning. Senior shortstop Chase Bushor drove in sophomore third baseman Ben Ramirez before scoring on a double play ball.
However, the Utes quickly struck back and retook the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning. Then, in the sixth inning, each team scored 1 run to bring the score to 5-3 going into the seventh inning. The Trojans then scored 1 more run in the seventh inning, but the Utes locked things down to take the contest.
The final game of the series ended the same way as the second. The Trojans came up short despite coming back from an early deficit, and the Utes claimed the final game of the series by a score of 5-4.
Following this series, the Trojans will take on Pepperdine, a team sitting above .500 on the year with a 17-14 overall record.
On paper, the matchup between the Trojans and the Waves appears to be even. Both teams have solid hitting with the same batting average of .270 on the year. Both teams also have comparable ERAs above 4. First pitch is Tuesday at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

Shortly after Tiger Woods secured his fifth Masters victory Sunday, I received a text from a friend. It read, “Is there anyone capable of stopping the whole sporting world the way Tiger just did?”
It’s a fair question, and one that requires a more in-depth response than you might think. Tiger has been golf’s biggest draw since he burst on the scene with a dominant victory at the 1997 Masters, where the 21-year-old became the tournament’s youngest winner by a historic 12-stroke margin. Woods’ dominance, laser-sharp focus and flair for the dramatic not only made him golf’s biggest star ever, it made the sport cool.
I don’t think it’s possible to overstate how famous Tiger was in the 2000s. His signature red shirt with black hat and pants combo became a staple of final rounds. Every youth golfer wanted the tiger club head cover. He single-handedly made Nike one of the go-to golf brands because he was a brand unto himself.
As Woods plowed his way to win after win, he built up a mystique reserved for sports’ all-time greats. Competitors wilted when playing final rounds with him, unable to cope with the combination of the blinding spotlight and Tiger’s deadly intensity. He seemed poised to join the ranks of Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan as athletes who were so great they transcended their sports to simply become public icons.
The height of the Tiger mystique was the 2008 U.S. Open, which Woods won in a dramatic playoff after holing a long birdie putt on the 72nd hole to stay alive. Oh, and he did it with a double stress fracture in his left tibia; the damage was such that he needed ACL surgery after the tournament. Watching Woods limp up and down that course and fend off the competition despite being unable to fully plant his feet is one of the greatest displays of grit and determination I’ve seen or even heard about in sports. To my 9-year-old self, Tiger was a god. He was unbeatable.
But then came the revelation that Woods had cheated on his wife with as many as 120 women. A mysterious car accident on Thanksgiving Day 2009 was revealed as the result of his wife’s discovery of the infidelity, and the ensuing reports and divorce took a major toll on Woods’ image.
Things continued to go downhill from there. Woods began to struggle with constant injuries, missing significant time from 2014-17 with back issues that forced him into four different surgeries. When he did play he was a shell of himself, missing cuts left and right. Tiger hit a low point in May 2017 when he was arrested near his Florida home for driving under the influence of what he said were prescription painkillers. A man once revered by all had become a punchline.
We’ve established that Tiger has serious issues at best and is a deplorable person at worst. So why was his final putt Sunday met with some of the loudest cheers ever heard on a golf course and “Tiger” chants so raucous that they seemed meant for a drunken tailgate rather than the neatly kept grasses of Augusta? And more importantly, why was I completely rooting for Tiger to win all weekend? Why did I nearly get choked up watching him raise his arms to the heavens and yell in celebration?
Following sports is often more complicated than it seems. There are certain players — the truly great ones — that have a singular impact, that grab the attention of the audience and captivate everyone watching. Getting to watch these players is the single best thing about sports fandom because it’s larger than you: It’s an experience you share with anyone else lucky enough to say “I watched one of the great ones play.” Tiger is indisputably one of the great ones.
Is it wrong that I, along with so many others, rooted our hearts out for Tiger this weekend? Is it selfish to look past the horrible things he has done and continue to support him? I don’t think that’s really for me to say. As I think I’ve proven, I might be a little too close to the situation to decide what is right and wrong. Obviously I don’t condone what Tiger did, but I can’t seem to escape the ineffable quality he possesses as a transcendent athlete. 
There are other reasons why his victory was so special. His comeback, no matter what you think of him as a person, is inspiring. It’s so rare to see someone be able to overcome the mental and physical challenges he’s dealt with, and you could see how much winning meant to him. His smile stretched from ear to ear, he let out multiple celebratory whoops and he hugged his caddy and family with uncontainable joy. It was hard in that moment not to be happy for a guy who took a long and difficult journey to get to this point.
And perhaps one of the reasons I wanted him to win so badly was that I wanted to feel like that awestruck little kid I once was. And I did. Growing up, Tiger always made me feel like anything was possible because of the overwhelming power of his talent. Now 43 years old, Tiger has taught an only slightly more mature version of myself that anything is possible with proper resilience and hard work. 
But when I try to sort through my conflicted feelings about rooting for Tiger, I keep coming back to the same point: It is simply special to watch him play his best. It is a privilege to experience anyone do something as well as Tiger has for the majority of his golf career. Sunday marked Woods’ 15th major victory, three behind Jack Nicklaus for most of all time. Watching Tiger is watching history in progress.
Woods is an outlier among outliers, a singular presence who stands out among the best not just for his talent, but the persona he brings to the links. Tiger’s ability to draw every eye in the sporting world and seemingly make everything stop is what makes him, and the experience of watching him, so special.

We’re currently in the midst of the worst (or best, depending on how you view it) two social media weekends of the year. Indeed, festival season is upon us, and no, I’m not talking about the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. Given the slew of beautifully obnoxious Coachella photos that have recently flooded my feed, I’m beginning to believe that the annual music festival should just be declared a national holiday. I recently saw a tweet that referred to Coachella as the “influencer olympics,” so we’re getting close.
Truth be told, if I were there, I’d also be flitting around in kimonos and taking ferris wheel photos. Attending Coachella costs hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars, so if I were to make the effort to attend, I’d also make an equal, if not greater, effort to get a damn good Instagram photo.
The Coachella aesthetic used to be sacred to the world of social media influencers. Growing up in Florida addicted to YouTube, I looked forward to — and almost revered — Coachella as this distant fairytale where all of my favorite internet personalities congregated to take pretty pictures that flexed their amazing lives, brand deals and excessive outfits for their fans. For a few years, the event routinely popped up on Instagram. I’m not even sure I registered that Coachella was, in fact, a music festival instead of a fashion show.
With its remote location, massive art sculptures, vivid light shows and cool palm trees arching in the background, Coachella is the surreal epitome of real-life Instagram. 
As I’m currently closing out my second year at USC, Coachella’s magical image has become a little dustier, with seemingly every other person I know going to Coachella on top of all the influencers I already follow. Honestly, the content my peers have been posting has rivaled, if not topped, the posts so-called “influencers” make a living off of. Interestingly enough, festival regulars and influencers alike seem to be vying for the same striking social media presence that makes absentees want to live the life they see on their screens.
Now that iPhones and VSCO filters are disposable commodities, anyone can post a pretty picture and call themselves an “influencer.”
Now, I find myself asking: So what are “influencers” influencing anyway, and why is the lifestyle so appealing?
The popularity of the term “influencer” has spiked significantly in the past few years, but I’ve found that many people outside of the social media world are still uncertain about what this word actually entails. Considering how casually the word is thrown around — from individuals with millions of followers across platforms to myself when my friends tease me after I post an Instagram photo — it’s no surprise that influencers are still widely misperceived.
The actual definition of “influencer” according to dictionary.com is “a person who has the power to influence many people, as through social media or traditional media.”
Sure, some social media personalities tangibly influence their followers to positively change their lives in some way — exposing them to different perspectives, helping people develop healthier habits or leading them to figure out how they self-identify. The common (and accurate) image of an influencer, though, tends to be of a conventionally attractive person posting a photo holding a paid product placement against a backdrop that promotes a lavish lifestyle.
The latter content format absolutely dominates social media and is often where “influencing” turns into encouraging a toxics game of comparison. Being more attractive. Attaining more expensive belongings. Achieving unending pleasure and fulfillment.
A few years ago, publicly being an influencer was a joke. Now? Being an influencer can be a viable career path (probably to many parents’ disappointment), with some of the biggest YouTubers like PewDiePie (over 94 million subscribers) making an estimated $1.2 to 19.8 million per year, according to Social Blade.
Despite popular opinion, I don’t view being an influencer as an “easy” job, as many assume. Though it may seem like a life of just looking pretty and posting on Instagram, it’s much more complicated and mentally draining behind the scenes. An influencer’s life is their brand, and there is little to no distinction between self and product. Living online has consequences — your life no longer becomes yours to live alone. 
My final column in the fall discussed my personal experience within the influencer sphere. After years of alternating on and off social media, particularly on YouTube, I found that the influencer life was not for me. I still stand by my decision, but I also fully support those who thrive as influencers and profit off of, well, being themselves.
So, whether you’re trying to achieve “influencer” status or not, go ahead and post that aesthetic Instagram photo from Coachella if it makes you happy. Thanks for tuning in to my sophomore year journey through “Internet Cultured,” and I’ll see you on the ‘gram.

The fight for the Iron Throne has begun again — and this time, for good.
On Sunday, “Game of Thrones” released its final season premiere on HBO and cut right to the chase. Westeros is in danger. Winter is here. The White Walkers are marching south on a blood-hungry killing spree. And despite the impending doom of fighting the Army of the Dead in the Long Night, political tensions across the Seven Kingdoms continue to rise — with the smug, ruthless queen Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) perched on her throne, relishing in her newfound power. 
In the Season 8 premiere “Winterfell,” the different roads paved throughout the series lead to the same castle. Since the Starks took control of Winterfell from the Boltons in the Battle of the Bastards, Winterfell has transformed into a thriving hotspot. Once the timid, idealistic girl who wanted to live in a perfect fairytale in King’s Landing, Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) now serves as Lady of Winterfell, handing down orders for all the people of the North and their allies to rally together and fortify the castle against the White Walkers when the time comes. At her side are her younger sister and assassin Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) and her younger brother-turned-Three-Eyed Raven Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) — the last remaining Starks — and together, they are here to defend Winterfell. 
Much to Sansa’s skepticism and the North’s frustration, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) has renounced his title of King in the North to bend the knee to Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), and has fallen in love with her. Unbeknownst to both of them, it is revealed in the seventh season by the omniscient Bran that Jon was never a Stark bastard as everyone believed; he is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys’ older brother, and Lyanna Stark, and therefore the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. In “Winterfell,” when best friend Sam tells Jon the truth about his Targaryen heritage, Jon is shaken up, torn between his duty to Westeros and love for Daenerys. 
The episode is marked by the emotional reunions between characters. Arya and Jon, who bid farewell to each other in the first season, share a hug at the godswood. And along with sharing a friendly exchange with Gendry (Joe Dempsie), Arya is shocked to see Ser Sandor Clegane, or “the Hound” (Rory McCann) alive and well in Winterfell, as he was minutes away from his death the last time she saw him. Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys, greets former wife Sansa after years of separation following King Joffrey’s death in the fourth season. 
And, to close the episode off, Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is greeted at Winterfell with a cold stare from Bran, whom he shoved out of an abandoned tower upon Bran’s discovery of his and Cersei’s incestuous relationship in the pilot. 
“Winterfell” strikes multiple parallels with the series pilot. Just as in “Winter is Coming,” during which the Starks open their doors to the Baratheons, the family in power at the time, Daenerys Targaryen and her lover-slash-nephew Jon march into Winterfell with their combined armies, with both scenes cemented by the same thrum of strings and drums composed by Ramin Djawadi. Additionally, viewers learn that the Night King, the leader of the White Walkers, has left the same message as he did in the pilot: a Fibonacci spiral of mangled limbs. And within its perimeter, a child has been turned into an icy blue-eyed wight — a reanimated corpse under the spell of the White Walkers — slowly creeping up to passersby and screeching until its final death by fire. It was clear that the creators intended to pay homage to the pilot; at the start, Westeros was on the brink of dissolving into the game of thrones, and winter was an impending but seemingly harmless threat. But now, winter is here, and houses are scrambling for safety come the Long Night. 
But even though most of the plotlines in “Game of Thrones” wrapped up by the seventh season, there are a few too many loose ends that have yet to be resolved. There are two critical plot points viewers are anticipating — battling the White Walkers and seeing who claims the Iron Throne — everything else is rightfully irrelevant. Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asbæk) and the Iron Islands seem too detached from the rest of Westeros, and him intruding on King’s Landing and laying with Cersei is rather misplaced. Harry Strickland (Marc Rissman), the captain general of the Golden Company, is also introduced when he comes to Cersei’s aid. But with only five episodes left, why continue with these trivial plotlines now? 
Also, illustrating the Jon-Daenerys duo as star-crossed lovers is too forced. The relationship already escalated quickly in the seventh season, and while the lovers have seemed to come together by means of fate (after all, the book series the show is based on is fittingly titled “A Song of Ice and Fire,” elements that can be attributed to the two), the two seem out of character when they interact with each other. Clarke’s cheerful demeanor seeps into Daenerys’ normally stone-cold personality when she embraces Jon. And when Jon and Daenerys ride her dragons Rhaegal and Drogon across Winterfell, the scene seems all too reminiscent of a romantic flight ripped out of “How to Train Your Dragon.” Perhaps the creators are drenching this episode with Jon-Daenerys love to somehow bend it into some tragic love story, but only viewers will see how their romance unravels later. 
But overall, this first episode has responded to fans’ anticipation with a bold opening to what looks like an unforgettable final season. The next few episodes will only expand on the chaos engulfing Westeros as the White Walkers take charge south.
Will Jon have to kill Daenerys when he dutifully claims the Iron Throne? Or will Daenerys’ hubris get the better of her as the Dead marches on? Viewers cannot help but just watch, listing their predictions for who will die and who will win the game of thrones.

Singer-songwriter Jaya Logani understands that love knows no boundaries and is forging a path for herself at the cultural intersection she occupies. Logani, a senior majoring in music industry who performs under the moniker JAYA, released her single “Double Rainbow” April 4 on Spotify. The Daily Trojan spoke with the rising artist about her musical career, creative process, Indian American heritage and plans for the future. 
Daily Trojan: When did you first realize that you wanted to pursue a career in music? Did you always want to write songs, or did you have an “aha” moment?
Jaya Logani:  My parents are both doctors … actually my grandparents are the ones who came from India, but my parents were toddlers when they came, so I’m second generation. So I have a lot of influences from my Indian culture, but also I’m such an L.A. girl.  
When I was 10, I had a formal sit-down with my parents, and I was like, “This is what I want to do with my life. I want to be a popstar.” And they were actually amazing about it. They took me seriously. When I was 10, I started writing songs and my dad would always take videos. He had a patient who ended up being a Grammy-nominated music producer. He showed that guy a video of me, and when I was 13, I actually got to start doing music. I had to prove to him that I could write my own songs, because he wanted me to sing songs that had already been written.
DT: How did you write “Double Rainbow.” What is the song about?
JL: I wrote [“Double Rainbow”] when I was 15. It’s the song that got me to prove to my producer that I could do my own stuff. I feel like the best songs that happen are the ones that just come … I really believe in these songs, and I want them to be finished. It fits into that whole theme of perfection and realizing that love can’t be perfect. My friends pointed out to me that [the song] also works well for those who are LGBTQ. I specifically did not use “he” or “she,” I made it “you” and “I.”
DT: Do you ever get writer’s block, or do songs come to you naturally?
JL: I am always writing things down. Someone will say something and I’ll think, “That would make a good title.” but the best ones are those that I am not expecting, the ones that come out of nowhere. “Double Rainbow” was actually one of those. This sounds so cheesy. I was waiting for hash browns to be made and I was in my room, strumming my guitar and waiting, and there was this moment when [I realized] something was about to happen, and it was not the hash browns. I grabbed my phone, and in 10 minutes, the song wrote itself.
DT: How do you describe your style? Is “Double Rainbow” different from your other works?
JL:  I call it pop, but that is a pretty broad genre. This first song is very singer-songwriter, and I’m actually going to put out another song April 26 during study days. That one’s a little more upbeat, and fits into the idea of empowering women. 
My EP is five songs, written at different points in my adolescence. “Double Rainbow” was [when I was] 15. 
“You’re not Getting Any” is coming out in the end of April, I actually wrote that when I was 12 and finalized the lyrics when I was 18 … I kept trying to write about a boy who I thought was my friend and I couldn’t for some reason, and I found that song from when I was 12 and I thought, “I have to change the lyrics to this and make it my anthem.” 
“Expectations” is from when I was 17, when I graduated high school. It’s about body image, and also college stress and all the expectations, all the “supposed tos.” I wanted to be perfect. “Down Low” is from when I was 19. 
The next set is going to be Indian fusion, R&B, hip-hop and pop.
DT: Do you have a team that make singles like “Double Rainbow” a reality?
JL: I’m so lucky. My best friends here are pretty much my team, and they are super talented. We’re all in the “DIY Marketing” music industry class where we form a team and we figure [out how to market music] for the rest of the semester. My friend Nick Smiley does all my visuals; we do photoshoots together, he [makes sure that I am] involved in the decisions on how I want the cover to look. We’re going to do a music video together. Emily Veh helps me book all my shows, my friend Madie Young is in charge of organizing and pitching to influencers and my friend Keri Srebnick is the behind-the-scenes queen who films everything that goes on and make these funny vlogs. I am so lucky that I have them. 
DT: Can we expect to see more songs in the near future?
JL:  I have a bunch of songs in the vault, but I don’t want to put them all out at once … It’s a streaming culture. You can’t put out an album with 20 songs — no one will listen to all that. People want to consume stuff really fast. To keep the ball rolling, you always have to have new stuff. I like that. I think it keeps things exciting. 
I think I finally reached that point where I don’t feel like I have to be perfect, so I can actually talk about it and put it out. That was part of the whole production process, too. I just need put it out and enter the real world knowing that I am done with that chapter and ready to move onto the next thing.
DT: How does your identity play a role in your music?
JL: I had always been the one Indian girl in my class, and when I came to USC there were thousands of Indian kids. I had to step it up. My next set of songs will be influenced by those experiences. I feel like being Indian is one culture and being American is another culture, and I’ve lived my life trying to be a blend of the two. There are a few actresses [like Mindy Kaling] who are starting to be that wave of Asian Americans who are Asian and American. A huge goal of mine is to bring those two together and bring them into the light in America. It’d be nice to be portrayed as super Indian and super American. I want to show that you can be both. I’m really excited to make the blend happen.

In recent years, social media has seen the rise of student-centered social media pages and groups, where students bond over shared experiences by posting humorous content. One of the most widely satirized topics is sleep, or students’ lack thereof. It is quite common to see memes with labels like “sleep is for the weak” and “sometimes when I sneeze, my eyes close.” While there is no harm in finding these posts humorous, they have inadvertently fostered a student culture in which sleep deprivation is normalized and even portrayed as an integral part of the college experience. By masking this dangerous habit with humor, it has become easy to ignore the serious consequences of neglecting sleep.
Sleep deprivation is not always a conscious choice for students — given the demands of school, work and extracurricular activities, it often feels like the only way to get everything done is by staying up late. On the other hand, when students do have free time and the chance to sleep earlier, they often feel pressured to fill up their schedule with more commitments due to the work-oriented mindset that persists in the college environment. Sacrificing sleep to cram in more work or activities is commended as a fruitful means of productivity, and the digital and campus culture that glorifies sleep deprivation validates this notion. However, all of the research in the field indicates that sleep has an adverse effect on productivity.
Sleep scientists have equated sleep deprivation to drunkenness — 17 to 19 continuous hours of being awake impairs cognitive functioning to the same extent as a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05, and longer periods push that number to 0.1. In both cases, the impact on cognitive performance includes shorter attention span, declined decision-making abilities and lower reaction time. More dangerously, most people who are sleep deprived do not realize how limited their mental faculties are similar to people who drive drunk.
This is especially harmful for students who pull all-nighters to cram for exams, believing that staying up longer gives them time to take in more information. Research has shown that without sufficient time to recharge at night, people not only work more slowly, but also make more careless mistakes. Furthermore, the brain commits all the information studied throughout the day to long-term memory when people are asleep. This means that even if students stay up all night to study more material last minute, they’re unlikely to remember it come exams.
In addition to causing cognitive slump short-term, lack of sleep also has far reaching consequences on emotional well-being. Students are already under a lot of stressors that put them at risk for mental health disorders like depression and anxiety, and prolonged wakefulness will only exacerbate the onset of these disorders. A study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine showed that medical interns who were chronically sleep deprived demonstrated higher levels of depression than their peers who were sleeping a healthy amount. This is because lack of sleep hurts the part of the brain responsible for mood regulation, hindering people’s abilities to cope with negative emotions in a healthy way. As mental health becomes a more widely discussed topic on college campuses, it is time to start making the importance of sleep a central part of the conversation.
As assignments pile up, it is common for students to stay up late under the pretense that just one late night will not have any dire consequences in the long run. However, just one late night can turn into an accumulation of sleepless nights over the years spent in university. In the long run, this build-up of prolonged wakefulness has extremely negative effects on physical health, including heart disease, diabetes and ultimately a shorter lifespan. 
The current trend of glorifying sleep deprivation on social media causes students to believe pulling all-nighters are not only expected, but impressive feats. However, considering both the mental and physical repercussions of sleep deprivation, all-nighters should be met with concern for the student’s health instead.
With exams approaching, it is more important than ever to recognize that sleep is an integral factor in academic success, not a barrier to it. Furthermore, long-term, physical and emotional well-being is far more important than an exam grade. Students must recognize that promoting sleep deprivation is toxic to both themselves and their peers and discard these perceptions to foster a healthy relationship with sleep.

In 1970, Richard Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency, and it received ample support across party lines. Fifty years later, the GOP administration has gutted the EPA and placed a coal lobbyist at its helm. Somewhere along the way, the environment wrongfully became a partisan issue, and we’ll need to reconsider policy discussions to change this.
We might blame Republicans for the shift away from non-partisan environmentalism. Over the decades, they have been more resistant than Democrats to environmental policy. Still, it’s important to note that approaches have evolved on both sides of the political spectrum. At one point, environmental protection meant preserving nature in the form of national parks. This aim was easily agreeable to both parties. As policies have increasingly imposed corporate regulation, Republicans have been resistant. Because of this, many of our discussions frame the GOP as an obstacle to overcome in addressing climate change. Whether or not this perception is fair, it does nothing to reconcile our conflicting positions. A better approach is to consider what kind of policy could achieve the bipartisan support of days past. 
The Green New Deal has been touted as one such solution, but its supporters come largely from the Democratic side. The plan makes promises for health care, trade unions and job leave, and while these issues are all worthy of attention, they ensure that the plan will not achieve the necessary Republican support. This is partly the reason President Donald Trump has called the deal “easy to beat.” But even if the Green New Deal restricted its scope to only its environmental policies, bipartisan approval would still be unlikely. The deal proposes regulations on major industries like oil, agriculture and energy. These points are a nearly impossible sell to a party that fundamentally opposes government interference in the economy.
If the Democratic Party dominates the next administration, then there’s a chance that the Green New Deal could succeed. We will likely see a flush of new environmental regulations, but this won’t mean much if the next Republican president rolls them right back. Our goal should be to establish a plan that will survive in the long run — a plan with strong support across party lines. This means accepting a conservative solution to climate change. 
The phrase “conservative solution to climate change” might sound like an oxymoron, but there are conservative plans that show promise. A number of prominent Republican leaders have crafted the Baker-Schultz Carbon Dividends Plan, and it has already gained widespread support from both parties. The plan proposes raising a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, which will be returned to American families. This carbon tax would far exceed America’s carbon reduction goals, which is why many Democratic leaders have supported it. The plan’s “hook” for the GOP is an agreement to reduce regulations as the plan achieves our emission reduction goals. 
That last point is a concession, but a concession is what we need to make progress in laying down climate change policy. The Baker-Schultz plan is not perfect, and a carbon tax will not be enough to seriously address climate change. But a perfect, all-encompassing plan is not what we need at the moment; we need a confident step in the right direction. 
It’s a great misfortune that our climate problem has become a partisan issue because it’s too dire to be addressed by one party alone. Nor can it be solved within a four-year term, which is why we need a plan that both Republicans and Democrats can support for decades to come. The environment is our collective responsibility, and we need to work together to protect it, regardless of our party affiliation.

When Olga Ramirez and Guilibaldo Rosales received a five-day eviction notice Friday from the home they’ve lived in for nearly 12 years, they had no idea USC was partly responsible for their misfortune. 
It wasn’t until their neighbor, Lisa Pulgarin, brought them to an informal tenants’ rights workshop Monday that they learned about USC’s widespread role in gentrification and rising housing costs. The workshop was held by USC Forward and other local organizations that are spending the week protesting USC’s displacement of local communities as a result of the University’s expansions into East and South Los Angeles, among other issues. 
Through the workshop, Ramirez, 45, and Rosales, 46, were able to meet with Noah Grynberg, an attorney from the Los Angeles Center for Community Law and Action. Ramirez and Rosales said meeting with Grynberg gave them hope for their future at 28th and Maple streets and that they plan to meet again Tuesday to discuss the details of their case.
Grynberg said that while LACCLA works with organizations that have dealt with USC in the past — like the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, which was present Monday — his organization was only introduced to problems like those facing Rosales and Ramirez about a month ago. 
He said that because LACCLA primarily operates in East Los Angeles, he hasn’t worked with people impacted by evictions and gentrification around University Park Campus. But as the Health Sciences Campus doubles down on its 25-year plan to expand by over 3 million square feet into the surrounding Boyle Heights neighborhood, he expects to see more cases like that of Ramirez and Rosales. 
“Traditionally [LACCLA hasn’t] dealt a lot with USC and with its impact on poor people in the city,” Grynberg said. “We’ve always been aware of USC and its impact on the cost of housing, but we are sort of acutely aware of it now.”
Grynberg emphasized the importance of local residents using their political power to push back against the University, but said change could take months or even years. 
“We will try to prevent as much displacement as we can,” Grynberg said. “But the way to do that is getting tenants to really exercise serious political power to change the behavior of politicians, developers [and] universities.”
Multiple organizers told the crowd USC could lessen the effects of gentrification in the surrounding communities by lobbying for tenant protection, providing more on-campus housing for students and engaging with tenants face-to-face. 
René Christian Moya, director of Housing is a Human Right — the housing advocacy division of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation — led a discussion with event organizers and local residents about the causes of displacement and gentrification. 
“There’s no other country in the world that does university like the way that we do, where it walls off the student community from the rest of the urban area,” Moya said. “You get a lot of students around here who are extremely complacent, who don’t actually see themselves as part of the community, they see themselves as part of something alien.”
Moya said he views displacement around USC’s campuses as part of a broader issue pervading the United States in the last 30 years, in which the growing appeal of urban environments has raised rent prices and pushed local residents out of homes they can no longer afford. 
“Big institutional actors end up playing a massive role in that process,” Moya said. “As they expand out, it puts massive upward pressure on home prices.”
Moya emphasized the differences between USC and universities like UCLA and Stanford, which, unlike USC, are not located in primarily non-white, lower class neighborhoods. 
“Gentrification and the housing crisis are not like hurricanes,” Moya said. “These are man-made social problems that can be resolved through social policy [and] political action.”
Earlier in the day, nearly 30 protesters from USC Forward, ACCE and other organizations discussed their experiences with eviction and gentrification and what solutions they expect USC to implement moving forward. 
Jackelin Lopez lived on Exposition Boulevard for seven years before getting evicted after the building’s new owners decided to renovate it for USC students. While she was able to find a new home in Mid-City, she said it is smaller and more expensive. 
“That person who evicted us was evicting people with families, was evicting people with disabilities, threw kids out onto the street, people who had nowhere to go,” Lopez said in Spanish. “That person didn’t even have the decency to offer relocation money and assure that we had a place to go after we were evicted.”
Since she moved, the building has been remodeled and cleaned. It was infested with cockroaches while she lived there. She also said that the rent for her old apartment before leaving had tripled. 
Lopez said she will continue speaking out to help people in the community find affordable housing options. She encouraged people to continue pushing for reform and legislation around equitable prices and just housing conditions. 
Veronica Castillo, a tenant from East L.A., was told in 2017 that she would need to leave her home by 2020 so that the  building could be turned from low-income housing into student housing. The landlord told her she could only stay if she was willing to pay $2,800 each month — an increase of about $1,300.  
When she went door-to-door talking to neighbors about fighting the evictions and asked for help from LACCLA lawyers, she faced pushback from the landlord, who reduced her parking spaces and accused her of various violations.
Moya also spoke about the Anti-Tenant Harassment Ordinance, a bill that he said is still being reviewed by the Los Angeles City Council. He said landlord-tenant harassment exemplifies some of the auxiliary effects of unregulated gentrification, which USC has the ability to mitigate. 
“Now I’ve woken up. Because of the lawyers I know that I have rights, that we’re still here and that the struggle is going to continue well after my case is over,” Castillo said in Spanish. “The seed has already been planted and now we’re watching it grow.”
Sergio Vargas, the District 9 organizer at ACCE, told stories of other local tenants who couldn’t make it to the event, but are also being pushed out of their homes due to increasing rents and poor living conditions, including mold and insect infestations. 
“Talking about infrastructure, how beautiful it looks around here and you go down [Martin Luther King Boulevard] and it’s just broken sidewalks … potholes everywhere, so that’s why we are here,” Vargas said. “We want USC to be a better neighbor, to be able to help out the community.”

The Los Angeles Times won the Pulitzer Prize Monday for investigative reporting for its series of stories uncovering the abuse of hundreds of former and current USC students at the hands of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall. 
In a May 2018 article titled, “A USC doctor was accused of bad behavior with young women for years. The university let him continue treating students,” Times reporters Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle revealed over 20 allegations of abuse against Tyndall. 
Columbia University announced the winners of the 2019 Pulitzer Prizes, which were awarded on the recommendation of the Pulitzer Prize Board. In a video posted on the Times website, the newspaper’s El Segundo office cheered and applauded after the announcement was made. 
According to the Times, this is the 45th Pulitzer Prize the newspaper has won since 1942.
“It was overwhelming and a huge honor — just a tribute to the commitment that the L.A. Times had put into covering USC and a credit to all the brave people at USC who spoke to us, many of them anonymously,” said Hamilton, a USC alumnus.
In the wake of the investigation, which rocked the USC community, former University President C. L. Max Nikias resigned amid calls from faculty, students and staff and Interim President Wanda Austin took office. After Austin’s appointment in August 2019, the University conducted a nationwide search for the University’s next president, which concluded with the selection of Carol Folt March 20.
“The award recognizes an extraordinary piece of journalism that continues the Los Angeles Times’ commitment to public service journalism and stories that have real impact on the lives of our readers,” L.A. Times Executive Editor Norman Pearlstein wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Through all of the turmoil of the last few years, the one constant has been the newsroom’s commitment to public service journalism.”
Since the investigation was published, the L.A. Times has revealed multiple investigations and reports about the University’s role in the scandal and the ongoing state and federal lawsuits against USC and Tyndall. In October, USC agreed to a $215 million class action settlement, which will distribute tiers of compensation to current and former patients of Tyndall. 
The series inspired investigations into Tyndall and the University’s knowledge of the abuse. The Los Angeles Police Department called the scandal the largest-ever sex abuse scandal in the department’s history. As of mid-March, there are over 650 plaintiffs across several lawsuits against Tyndall and the University. 
“In terms of impact, I think it was nothing that any of us working on the story could have foreseen,” Hamilton said. “That so many former patients of Tyndall would come forward. That so many professors would mobilize and protest against the administration — and specifically Max Nikias. It was shocking, and we certainly didn’t predict any of it.”
Hamilton, who graduated with a master’s degree in journalism in 2014, said the impact of the story on the USC community is what mattered most.
“I think what mattered is that it got the attention of the people who work at USC, who attended there and study there and care deeply about the University,” Hamilton said. “It had an impact on alumni and parents of students as well.”
Hamilton said during his two years of reporting on USC for the Times, he has seen changes in the administration  
“[In] the process of selecting the new president, there was much more openness with the community than in prior times,” Hamilton said. “The leadership at the Trustee level and the administration seem to recognize that transparency is important and that the old ways of doing business need to be reformed.”
During his graduate education, Hamilton participated in Annenberg TV News and Neon Tommy, a now-defunct online media platform sponsored by Annenberg. He credits his USC education for providing him with a nuanced perspective in reporting.
“It’s undeniable that I see the University differently than other reporters do,” Hamilton said. “When it comes to the reporter trying to hold an institution accountable, I probably approach it differently having been a student. And I think I care deeply about the University because it gave me such a positive and great education.”
According to the L.A. Times, the investigation began when Ryan received an anonymous tip in February 2018 that revealed Tyndall’s abuse. The reporters spent three months interviewing sources and victims.
“Harriet and Paul are both such amazing and dedicated and thorough and tenacious reporters,” Hamilton said. “It was like a masterclass in investigative journalism, being able to work beside them … Each of us brought different things to the table.”
