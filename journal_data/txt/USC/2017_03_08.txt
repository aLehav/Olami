Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanCrossing continents · Sophomore Hatim Eldawi realized that classrooms in American universities were different from those in Sudan.
On a Thursday afternoon, Hatim Eldawi glided through USC on a tiny black skateboard. He was wearing a denim jacket, skinny jeans and charcoal grey Vans — an outfit that differed dramatically from the wardrobe he brought with him when he moved to Los Angeles.
The 19-year-old came to college with suitcases full of collared shirts and dress pants, standard uniform for his high school in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital city. His friends at USC poked fun at his formal attire, which stuck out amid the sea of sandals and tank-tops most students wear on USC’s sunny campus. Still, other things surprised him even more about his new environment.
In Sudan, students who dared  to curse in class would be sent to the principal’s office — a norm he realized did not apply in American universities. When a classmate used profanity during lecture, Eldawi said the professor laughed and responded with an expletive of his own.
Eldawi’s peers appeared equally curious about his North African culture. Fellow students asked him if he slept with lions and rode a camel to school, if he descended from a royal family or if he had come to the United States as a refugee. Though Eldawi chuckled as he recalled some of these questions, the sophomore business administration major said he was disappointed by the sheltered worldview exhibited by many USC students.
“It made me feel so different,” Eldawi said. “Like an alien.” 
To many friends and acquaintances, he’s known as “Sudan guy,” a nickname he carries with pride, but one that has become increasingly difficult to break out of. 
One week into his administration, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that indefinitely suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees and temporarily barred people from seven nations, including Sudan, from entering the country. The sweeping policy stunned Eldawi, who wondered what the Sudanese people had done to deserve such condemnation from the U.S. government.
On Monday, Trump approved a revised version of the original travel ban, which created chaos at airports nationwide and was blocked by federal courts. But the order’s overarching message remains the same, and reflects broader trends Eldawi has observed about USC — and American culture in general. 
“It’s a norm at USC to use labels to define people,” Eldawi said.
Eldawi has always had an uneasy relationship with labels — they fail to capture the complexity of his lived experiences, he said. The middle child of three brothers, he was born in San Jose, Calif., to Sudanese parents. The family relocated to Dubai, The United Arab Emirates, when Eldawi was eight, before moving to Sudan five years later. Tall and long-limbed with caramel skin and contemplative dark eyes, Eldawi regards his identity as a function of time and place.
As a kindergarten student in San Jose, Eldawi spoke with an Arabic tongue that distinguished him from his English-speaking peers. In Dubai, his African heritage defined him, and in Khartoum, Eldawi’s lighter complexion and American passport gave him a privileged status that many in the sprawling, dust-choked city could only dream of.
Coming to USC forced him to search for belonging yet again — as an American-born black Muslim who had spent most of his formative years in Africa. He acquired a new wardrobe of T-shirts, shorts and sneakers and learned casual Southern California slang. He joined a fraternity, an involvement that initially made him uneasy, but one that he has come to embrace.
“I felt like I had to re-assimilate when I came to USC,” Eldawi said. “Nobody understood where I came from.”
Eldawi now shares a room in the Kappa Sigma house with his good friend and fraternity brother Mike Gurayah. The two met on orientation day and immediately bonded over their shared Muslim faith. Gurayah, a sophomore majoring in business administration, described his roommate as “one of the nicest guys you will ever meet.” He praised Eldawi’s selflessness and generosity of spirit.
“Once he sees someone sad, even if he doesn’t know you, he’ll go up to talk to you and get to know what you’re feeling,” Gurayah said. “That’s just the type of person Hatim is — always willing to help someone else.”
Gurayah said Eldawi offers him advice about everything from academics to personal relationships. He often comes home to a made-up bed and clean desk — favors Eldawi completes without asking for anything in return.
Just as Eldawi had begun to find his place at USC, Trump won the election — an outcome that upset him deeply, and one that he said reflected exclusionary sentiments pervasive in the United States. Although the President’s rhetoric has distanced him further from American culture, he said prejudices against Muslims existed long before Trump took office.
“The ban was fuel added to the fire [against the Muslim community],” Eldawi said.
Despite his American passport, Eldawi fears Trump’s policy has typecasted him as an outsider in his country of birth. But he said he never felt very American anyway — when people ask him where he’s from, he defines himself as Sudanese. 
Upon graduation, he intends to return to Sudan, where he hopes to start a business that will create economic opportunity for more people in the North African nation. He’s grateful for the opportunity to attend USC, and said the greatest long-term impact of the executive order will be impeding access to higher education. 
“If anything we should further encourage students to come here and study,” Eldawi said. “The quality of education [in Sudan] is nothing compared to here.”

After President Donald Trump’s executive orders restricting travelers from majority-Muslim countries and increasing the detention of undocumented immigrants, students have expressed their concerns about their ability to travel in and out of the country.
The Graduate Student Government has responded to these students by creating the GSG Emergency Fund for Undocumented and International Students. The resolution, which was drafted by the USC Price Student Organization Coalition, will allocate $20,000 in emergency funding for students facing student visa issues because of Trump’s policies, and also will also help students who benefit from the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals by paying the fees to renew their status, according to a proposal sent to the Daily Trojan.
“The resolution is denouncing President Trump’s executive order restricting the refugee resettlement program and travel from the seven Muslim-majority countries,” said Christina Gutierrez, one of the co-founders of the Price Student Organization Coalition. “[It] reaffirms support for refugees, Muslim immigrants and religious minorities.”
According to GSG, the initiative will provide a maximum of $700 per student to help with visa-, DACA- and other renewal-related costs, as well as legal fees and other expenses. GSG also stated its commitment to ensuring strict confidentiality with applicant records and promised to delete any personal information they receive within two days of distributing funds.
“No administration money is going into it, it’s our funding as Graduate Student Government, and part of that funding comes from international and undocumented students,” said GSG Director of Campus Affairs Christopher Lo-Records. “[The fund is] carryover, so it’s excess money that we have left over after seeding to our core programs.”
Because the emergency fund is run by GSG, undergraduate students will not have access to the funds.
“We’re the only branch of student government doing this, which means that undergraduate students are not being served to the same extent that graduate students are,” Records said. “I think that USG bears a responsibility to do what we’ve done.”
Records also stated that USC’s large international population means that the University has a duty to fight for inclusion and justice for foreign and undocumented students. According to the Department of Homeland Security, 252 students from countries banned by Trump’s executive action go to the University.
“We have a particular role to play because [USC is] so reliant on international students,” Records said. “We have a responsibility to be even more vocal and even more of a leader to advocate for this.”
Editor’s note: A previous version of this article stated Christina Gutierrez was a founder of the Price Student Organization Coalition. She was actually the co-founder along with Victor Sanchez, Britney Wise, Anna Evans Goldstein, Nick Weinmeister, Andrew Lamotte and Nadia Kelifa.
International Students and students here illegally (whom many continue to call “undocumented”) are not the same thing, unless as stated above, the international student does not have a valid student visa and is therefore here illegally. Everybody needs to pull it together and get a grip on reality. Concepts like visas, passports, green cards, citizenship, etc are all very important an meaningful. Democrats and others who continue to support illegal immigration are cheapening these important concepts, and promoting different standards of enforcement for different people. Consider this: A person who comes to the US on a visa, but then overstays their visa, is rightfully subject to deportation, and is not permitted to reapply for 10 years. Meanwhile, we see that illegal immigrants who came here with no visa or any documentation are “demanding” citizenship! It’s completely unacceptable! That is true injustice!
The President has issued a TEMPORARY TRAVEL BAN from 6 nations that have been identified by this administration AND the previous administration as lacking acceptable vetting procedures for travelers. The current executive order includes exemptions which are expressly cited. Among those are notably, persons with valid visas. All international students at USC, including those from the countries listed on the temporary travel ban, are required to possess valid student visas (or alternative documentation such as a valid green card). If they have a valid student visa, then they are exempted from the TEMPORARY TRAVEL BAN. Such students have nothing to fear, and suggestions by politically motivated groups (including attorney activists) are irresponsible and misleading. It’s disgusting
What’s really disgusting is the fact that “the President” (don’t seem to remember your kind extending that honorific to #44) wanted a Muslim ban, completely botched the previous one (because he thinks the law consists of him opening those fish lips and issuing commands) and now sugarcoats turd #2 with vagueness. So yeah, sure, the text says 120 days. 120 days in which “the President” will go through 1,000 different moods and tweet countless stupidities and say anything he damn well pleases depending on what he sees in Breitbart. And then he’ll renew it, because that’s the constant with this guy. He changes moods and minds and opinions (along with wives, mistresses, 6 foot long ties, sexual fantasies about his daughter, and toupees) on most things, but the core viciousness remains the same. He was a racist and a sexist yesterday; he’ll be one tomorrow. Just as he was a liar yesterday and will be one tomorrow.
As far as undocumented students, what a load of crap you’re spouting. I’m sick to death of people whose ancestors came here when there weren’t actually any meaningful controls on immigration talking about how everyone else (including children who came here at 3 or 4 years old) needs to obey “the law.” My great-grandparents came here in the 1890s. They didn’t have to wait in line. They got on a boat and went to Ellis Island and bam, they were Americans. That’s the way it was, up until the nativists took charge of immigration policy in 1920s and did what they good to keep the country Anglo. Gee, what a success that was, huh? No doubt President Know Nothing will be just as successful in attempt #2. 
But there’s no point arguing about it. You want your permanently excluded underclass and your militarized border, so there you go. Build your wall. Pay for it. Tax me for it. See what it gets you. Because it’ll be a big fat bag of nothing. You want Big Daddy to get the jobs to come pouring back and the factories to magically reopen and the country to magically return to lily whiteness and you want girls to be girls and men to be men and Archie Bunker at the piano and good luck to you. I just want whatever you’re smoking (which is legal, because this is California).
FINALLY… now that we’ve cleared up some facts, back to my original response to this particular article. Any president has the right to halt immigration and travel to our country at any time. The constitutional statute actually reads that the president may suspend immigration and travel to the US for “any person or any class of people” at his election, and may suspend that right “for such a period as he deems necessary”. Don’t be fooled by your own hatred for Donald Trump. If President Obama had made this executive order, we would not even be talking about this. So, in review… all i was saying is that it is WRONG, and IRRESPONSIBLE to be stoking fear among students at USC or any university because if they are here under valid student visas or green cards (as they should be… as I was when i was a student at USC)… then they have nothing to fear.
2. There is no vagueness with his second executive order. It is crystal clear, but rather than read the text of the order, you and others have chosen to interpret sub-text.
Christopher… I’ve been trying to post replies to your comment and they are being deleted.  Very disturbing.  I enjoy open, fair and honest debate… but it seems you won’t be able to see my replies because they are being removed.
There you go. It was emailed to me. Don’t know whether admin deleted it or you did that so you could do the whole “You’re all delicate, censoring snowflakes and I’m a big, brave, principled person being persecuted” thing. 
 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cbdcc1c2fadd4381121388461df5a94ba367015ff3c9157d7f03804ab9f39940.png
You’re killing me man!  Why are you continuing with the personal attacks (“Archie Bunker” etc).  Delicate flower… Snowflakes.. Persecuted?  Why are you even suggesting that I would lie about whether or not I removed it or DT did?  I promise you I do not post, then delete, then complain like a delicate flower!  None of that helps your cause in an intelligent debate.
Anyway… Glad you were at least able to read my reply.  You just can’t presume things about people when you go on the attack.  I don’t presume or attack.  I post comments in open and honest debate over the issue at hand.  Trump has done a lot of things wrong (and will continue to I’m sure)… But there will also be things he gets right.  In fact, in the end, that’s sort of how it is with most presidents.
And here are my responses:
1. Yep. I hate Trump. Lot of good reasons to. He’s a terrible, rotten, greedy, disgusting person. 
2. It is vague. It is vague when it supposedly exempts students with valid visas from the six countries but totally leaves out the matter of what happens when those visas expire. Do those students have any chance of receiving a visa renewal, even when they might not be finished with their programs yet? Do they have to wait for Trump to make up his mind about whether to extend it for another 120 days? It’s totally unmentioned. 
3. Hooray for you for pulling the Milo card (I’m gay, therefore you can’t attack me for being hateful). I’ve looked through previous comments of yours denying that Transgender people have legitimate identities. So, yeah, maybe you’re fine with conservative, white gay men, but you’ve obviously got a problem with queerness. And maybe that’s even worse than when straight folks hate on LGBTQ people, because you have a sense of what marginalization feels like and yet fail to extend it to other people who deserve the same understanding that you’ve asked for. 
4. Whatever. 
5. So, “the law of the time” should never be challenged or changed then? There goes all forms of civil and incivil disobedience in Western History. The Reformation, the American and French Revolutions, the Civil War, Civil Rights, Gay Rights, etc. Gone, because we have to be obedient to “the law of the time.”
1.  Again, you are certainly entitled to this position.  (One shared by many.)
2.  Correct.  Whenever anyone’s student visa expires, they have to apply for a renewal. That renewal can be approved or denied.  If denied, they must leave the country.  That has been the law for a long time.  Again, I think you are operating from the wrong premise that people are entitled to visas.  They are not.  They can be denied, and even revoked.  None of that existing law and policy has anything to do with Trump.
3.  Milo is gross and I am not a fan or supporter of his.  Yes, you did correctly read my position (and science’s position) on  so-called “transgenders”.  In review:  Sexuality does occur on a spectrum… but gender is binary.  Drop the T and the Q.  “LGB” is the truth.  If you indeed read all of my other commentary on this subject you would see that i explain the need for compassion for people who suffer this disorder (just like we must have compassion for people with any disorder).. But we must not pretend that this is normal.. and we certainly arent’ helping them out by indulging them in a lie.  (You cracked me up with the bit about me wanting “men to be men and girls to be girls”… as if that’s a problem.)
4.  You’re welcome.
5.  You totally misunderstood this point.  My point is not that we don’t have the right to challenge laws… what i’m saying is that using past laws in your argument is meaningless.  Borders and boundries etc have changed around the world all the time, through wars, and treaties and (as you mentioned) simple manifest destiny.  But how things worked then is not the same as how things work now.  For example:  Years ago, the area of Orange County known as “Newport Coast” was unincorporated county territory.  Then later, the city of Newport Beach annexed that land, and it is now part of the City limits… and residents there are NOW subject to city ordinances and taxes etc…  NOT county ordinances and taxes as they used to be. Your logic would suggest that a resident there can simply say “well, I will abide by county rule, not city rule, because i was here when this was county land”.

Such students have nothing to fear, and suggestions by politically motivated groups (including attorney activists) are irresponsible and misleading. It’s disgusting
Of course if international students do not have valid student visas, then they should be very afraid, and no attorney worth his or her license should be promising or suggesting otherwise.
The lies have to stop. I get it. People hate the President… But presenting lies and stoking fear is not acceptable.
Meanwhile: International Students and students here illegally (whom many continue to call “undocumented”) are not the same thing, unless as stated above, the international student does not have a valid student visa and is therefore here illegally. Everybody needs to pull it together and get a grip on reality. Concepts like visas, passports, green cards, citizenship, etc are all very important an meaningful.

Meanwhile, we see that illegal immigrants who came here with no visa or any documentation are “demanding” citizenship! It’s completely unacceptable! That is true injustice!
Finally, please note that there is no RIGHT to travel in and out of any country. That’s another lie. Travel in and out of almost any nation is a privilege that can be revoked or regulated at any time in a number of ways. Law must be made by Congress, but the President is granted a fair bit of latitude in regulating said law. As we know, the previous administration chose, at it’s election, policies of “looking the other way”. Thankfully the current administration is choosing not to look the other way, but instead to enforce existing immigration law almost across the board. That is inherently a more fair policy. Stop the lies and hysteria.
Stop the lies and histrionics.  The President has issued a TEMPORARY TRAVEL BAN from 6 nations that have been identified by this administration AND the previous administration as lacking acceptable vetting procedures for travelers.  The current executive order includes exemptions which are expressly cited.  Among those are notably, persons with valid visas.

The world is built on binaries: good and evil, war and peace and life and death. The work of Sherin Guirguis, an artist, associate professor and vice dean of faculty at the Roski School of Art and Design, challenges notions of the informal and formal, the structured and chaotic, the arts and the politics. 
On Tuesday, Guirguis spoke to USC students and faculty about the power art has to connect different artistic methods and people. Born in Luxor and raised in Cairo until she was 14, Guirguis has experienced both urban and rural environments, American and the Egyptian ethnic identities, and has fused these experiences into her activism and art. Her work focuses on connecting opposites together, both in art and in life. 
Her most recent work “One I Call,” which is currently on display at the Desert X exhibit in Palm Springs, is an interactive complex based on the pigeon towers of Egyptian villages. Often used to serve as beacons of the outskirts of civilizations or the ancient mail systems of rural communities, these pigeon towers were  central places for communities. “One I Call” aims to do the same by incorporating the natural landscape of the Whitewater Reserve of the Coachella Valley into a beautiful complex with which visitors can interact.
The final piece is a
beehive-esque tower, in which gold leaf circles and sticks align in geometric patterns that collect sunlight in a dazzling way. The landscape of the exhibit — tall mountains where sheep graze, and birds burrow in the boulders — complements the small tower nested in a beautiful desert. When visitors come, they truly are able to interact and experience the history behind the pigeon tower, the Coachella Valley and the civilizations before it.
“We came to a place, we made a work about that place and then we had people from that place engaged,” Guirguis said. “That felt good.”
Furthermore, the monument represents Guirguis’ goal when creating the art piece. Its sustainable resources and location connect what once belonged to another desert on the other side of the world to the animals and ecosystem of Southern California’s deserts. Just as it was created using the dust of the valley, the exhibit will soon deteriorate and return back to its roots: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
“I wanted to make sure the concept, the form, the research and the expectation I had was all really ingrained in that sight — that specific desert, that specific history,” Guirguis said.
Guirguis’ other work maintains this level of thought-out creation and representation. Her works, which have been featured in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as well as the California African American Museum, aim to connect the foreign with the familiar by breaking down the political notions of art. 
After noticing how Eastern ornamentalism was considered decorative and frivolous when compared to Western use of abstraction and geometry, Guirguis decided to prove the validity of ornamentalism in modern art through her works concerning the feminist movement in Cairo. 
Drawing inspiration from vintage photos of trailblazing feminists unveiled in front of a train station, Guirguis constructed large paintings that incorporated colorful watercolor splatters with the distinct, perfect design of minimalist, geometric patterns. Standing in front of depictions of the train station’s doors and the house of a feminist leader, the viewer is encouraged to pay attention to the details and see how Eastern and Western forms of art can work together — how the  spontaneous can complement the carefully constructed. In doing so, Guirguis challenges the viewer to question their beliefs about art and the politics that dictate our lives. 
Blending minimalism and abstraction with Eastern ornamentalism and decoration, Guirguis redefines history and the modern world. Standing in front of the door to the house or the train station, the audience recognizes that the current perspective on history and society can be far from the truth. In order to really understand the world, one must challenge the structures our society has created and recognize what is valued and what needs to be valued.
“I was hoping that in presenting [this collection], I could then access a conceptual idea of that when formal systems fail us, we use informal systems to replace them,” Guirguis said. “It’s how we value these things in today’s world.”

This year, Chance the Rapper was the first artist to win a Grammy for a streaming-only album, which basically means he won a Grammy for his mixtape. The award is revolutionary for music in a lot of ways, but what’s most important is that Coloring Book is another example of the changing landscape of the music industry.
 Chance the Rapper isn’t the only artist who has joined the trend of releasing music in a unique way. Frank Ocean and Beyoncé both released visual albums last year, and both sparked enough chatter to get fans wondering if this is the new trend that artists are moving toward.
 The history of visual albums is very obscure, and it’s only now that visual albums are getting the attention they rightfully deserve. Daft Punk did it while recording Discovery — creating an animated short film and collection of music videos that uses music to accompany a storyline. Even The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night could be considered a visual album, despite its dated age.
 However, one of the most unique and committed ways an artist has released new music is Childish Gambino’s Because the Internet. The rapper went all out with the release, not only making a darker album that showcased his growth as an artist, but also taking advantage of his public perception and shaping it into  something bigger. He even released a screenplay with Because the Internet to connect its overarching narrative to his first album.
 He accomplished this because it fit his public persona: a multi-talented artist who can act, write, sing, rap and produce — among many other skills. In a sense, he didn’t merely create a new album — he constructed a fictional universe that included this character in his albums. He even went so far as to dress, speak and act like the same character to promote his new albums, so whenever Childish Gambino was in an interview, he was also portraying this character.
 This begs the question — did he make the screenplay for this album? Or did he make the album as a soundtrack for the screenplay? Does it have to be one or the other? If you’re a true Childish Gambino fan, you can understand what he’s trying to accomplish as an artist who wants to do something groundbreaking. This is Childish Gambino’s way of finding his own voice as an artist in digital age, and other artists are doing the same.
 Beyoncé and Frank Ocean didn’t release traditional albums because they felt like their music was above that. Chance the Rapper said in an interview with Jimmy Fallon that he releases his music for free because it gives him “more space to create,” and that other artists are also doing creative and unique things with their music because that’s what the landscape of music is like today.
 He’s absolutely right about that. Artists are discovering new ways of making music that go beyond traditional albums. With the internet, anyone can download their music for free, so it’s up to artists to figure out different ways to make themselves stand out. New concepts like visual albums haven’t taken off until now because there was no need for them. People were happy to buy an album and call it a day, but that’s not the case anymore. The more creative you can get with your music, the more likely you’ll be able to find fans who respect and appreciate what you’re doing.
 The shift from releasing music in a traditional sense to the current, diverging methods of music release hasn’t been the smoothest transition. But this new wave of music trends is in its early stages, and there’s an electricity in the air that piques people’s interest. I wasn’t necessarily sure what to make of Kanye West’s fashion show and album listening party, but I was certainly intrigued. I thought it was interesting to see how his music inspires his fashion and vice versa. I was even more skeptical when he said he actively changed things on his album even after it was released, calling it a “living breathing changing creative expression.” But I’ll admit — most of the changes were for the better. 
 Living in the current world of music is living in a world of uncertainty. However, we shouldn’t resist the changes that are happening. It’s captivating to see new changes unfold. Never in a million years would I have thought that someone like Chance the Rapper would release their music for free, but it’s a welcome change. The music industry is changing at a rapid pace — don’t blink, or you might miss it.

A guitar hummed threateningly in the background, as a student clad in black stood center-stage, deeply breathing in and out. Playback Theatre was enacting a student’s story of the insecurity she felt not being cast in any theatre show.
Each member of the theatre played a different role — some served as the girl’s conscience, some contributed to the background noise and others acted as her inner emotions as the girl looked through callback list after callback list. 
Comprised of 13 USC students, Playback Theatre recreates audience members’ stories through improvisational acting. By incorporating music and dance into their acts, Playback Theatre aims to recognize the various human emotions people experience. 
The group acted out five stories on Tuesday night, beginning its performances at 8:30 p.m. Beyond its portrayal of a girl’s theatre casting rejections, the group also played out several other stories, ranging its emotions from humor to insecurity to even fear. 
One of the stories the group took on revolved around a girl’s Tinder experience, in which she went on a dinner date expecting to have only one date. However, she was met by two men who made a ruckus at the restaurant by trying to order expensive wine. Upon realizing the wine’s price, the two men left in the middle of the dinner, asking her to drive them to a grocery store so that they could buy cheap wine. 
The story continued until the girl found out that one of the men had actually spent a night in jail, and subsequently began to question her poor decisions in choosing to go on a Tinder date. Her lack of clear judgment led to her choice in other men as well, including her ex-boyfriend, who ended up having a drug problem. 
The show then focused less on the plot details and more on the girl’s tumultuous emotional experience throughout her encounters with the two men and with her ex-boyfriend. 
The members reenacted her feeling of anxiety, exhilaration, disappointment and her ultimate feeling of hope as she recovered from her negative experiences and looked forward. 
The use of music and rhythm added to the emotion and allowed Playback Theatre to give each of their stories a cinematic mood, dramatizing emotions to make the stories more accessible to the audience members. 
The improv troupe’s members also used their physical bodies to imitate mental thoughts and decisions, often acting as consciences and personality traits to bring each story to life. 
The effect was a night of silence, shock and laughter, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats as they felt personally immersed in each student’s story. Through the power of improvisation, Playback is able to depict an emotional narrative of students’ personal experiences that
fully captures the observer’s
attention.

Rejection has always been an uncomfortable word for me. Whenever I think of rejection, I think of crumpled papers, emails that start with “Thank you for your interest, but unfortunately we are unable…” and boys who say “I like you, but only as a friend.” 
A semester ago, I came across an article from Literary Hub by writer Kim Liao titled “Why You Should Aim for 100 Rejections a Year.” At that time, I was feeling defeated. I had such grand hopes for the beginning of my junior year, but nothing ever went the way I had planned the summer before. The article encourages readers to collect rejections as if they are something to aim for, rather than shy away from: “Collect rejections. Set rejection goals. I know someone who shoots for one hundred rejections in a year, because if you work that hard to get so many rejections, you’re sure to get a few acceptances, too.”
I didn’t know what to think of it. Quantity over quality? Putting yourself out there, socially and mentally, can be extremely draining and discouraging, especially if done continually. Whether it’s trying out for multiple campus organizations or interviewing for jobs and internships, it’s all the same routine. Our society encourages us to “always be yourself!” but it never tells us that we can only be ourselves to the extent that we are socially acceptable. Be social and approachable, but not so much that you are unable to be professional or get work done. Be proactive, but not too eager. There’s always too much overanalyzing involved in trying to be the best version of myself, and the more I thought about it, the more putting aside my fragile ego and insecurities to go for this new perspective sounded appealing. 
And so, with the mindset that there is nothing to lose, I began to try. If I saw something I was remotely interested in, I decided to go for it instead of backing out. It wasn’t so much blindly inserting myself in random situations just to say I did it. It was more about deciding to be unafraid to try new things or experiences and grow discovering new things about myself from them. I tried for a lot of things that aligned with my career goals and interests, but the most random thing I did was when my friend and I decided to try out for an a capella group together. The closest thing I’ve ever done to singing in front of people is whispering at a low volume in the car to the radio or standing in the back of my high school choir. When she asked me after the audition what scale they asked me to sing after my song, I realized that they didn’t even ask me to sing a scale. I guess they only ask you to sing a scale if you’re actually good. We laughed about it and we both didn’t get in, but it was a funny experience and I had no hard feelings about it thanks to my new “collecting rejections” mindset. 
I began to take everything with a grain of salt ended up raking in a lot of acceptances (as well as rejections of course) only because I went in without the terror of trying and failing. This mindset has been a saving grace for my constantly anxious mind.
Over a semester of collecting rejections later, this new mentality has become more than a social experiment for me. With social media as a way to broadcast our highlights and accomplishments, it has become harder and harder for millennials like myself to deal with comparison and self-doubt. It’s funny, when my friends from other schools see my social media and say that I’m doing so well at USC and am so involved in so many things, they have no idea that I probably submitted an application for 20 different jobs to get that one or had to try out twice for an organization to be able to get in. That’s probably what I should remind myself when I find that I’m envious of someone else who is seemingly doing very well. Embracing rejection with open arms has taught me to leave my ego at the door and not to be afraid to fail. In the words of Wayne Gretzsky and Michael Scott, “You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take.”
The next time a rejection rolls around, I’m pretty sure I’ll be 100 percent fine. On to the next one.

After playing hide-and-seek with the estimated 18 million Americans slated to lose access to healthcare via the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act, House Republicans finally, unceremoniously unveiled a provisional replacement plan on Monday evening. Many are already celebrating the bill as a bipartisan victory, as it will respect some of the ACA’s most popular features, such as allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26 and prohibiting insurers from denying coverage or charging more to patients with preexisting medical problems.
But these compromises belie an underhanded attack on women’s rights buried within the bill’s fine print, and a move that, for all of the unabashed conservative drive to attack women’s bodily autonomy, is ultimately counterproductive to conservatives’ own goals. That attack is the defunding of Planned Parenthood, an organization that serves millions of low-income women, girls, members of the LGBTQ community and, of course, on a particularly relatable note, broke college students with their futures at stake. 
Planned Parenthood offers these groups — and many others — crucial healthcare services, STI testing and treatment and the very contraception and sexual education that, frankly, prevent the abortions conservatives so loathe.
It’s no secret that legislative attacks on Planned Parenthood are directly rooted in conservative lawmakers’ disdain for the procedure, and their ultimate political goal of eradicating abortion. It’s funny, then, that they should target the ultimate mechanisms through which unwanted pregnancies and, as a result, abortions are deterred — but more on that later.
At this point, we’ve all heard the talking points cited as often as Planned Parenthood is subjected to political attacks and defamatory conservative propaganda (which is, well, often) — that only 3 percent of the services the organization provides are abortions, and of course, due to the Hyde Amendment, federal funding cannot pay for abortions. 
These talking points by Planned Parenthood advocates, while well-meaning, might just be worth reconsidering: To assert that abortions make up little of the services the organization offers almost caters to the conservative narrative that abortion is a shameful procedure, and to state that no federal tax dollars pay for abortion implies that this systemic denial of low-income women’s human rights is somehow justified. It’s as if we’re admitting that there is, indeed, something wrong with prioritizing women’s bodily autonomy and human rights over fertilized eggs and unviable fetuses. 
Abortion does not deserve the stigma it is mired in, and pro-choice activists must take care not to legitimize ignorant portrayals of it. 
But at the end of the day, believe it or not, pro-choice activists and their opponents share a common goal, and that is the desire to reduce abortions. 
Pro-choice activists do so by advocating for accurate sexual health education and access to contraception. Anti-abortion lawmakers seek to do so via needless legal and financial barriers, from imposing medically unnecessary regulatory laws that shut down abortion clinics, to mandated waiting periods rendering the procedure more expensive, to costly fetal burial requirements, to the aforementioned Hyde Amendment and so much more — all of this, on top of reinforcing cultural stigma around the procedure through inaccurate portrayals of it as murder.
These methods yield very different results, as Republicans’ effort to defund Planned Parenthood, if successful, will show. Don’t take my word for it, though. Take a look for yourself at data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the years: The national rate of abortions dropped from 16 abortions for every 1,000 women to 12.5 from the anti-abortion Bush administration to the pro-abortion rights Obama administration, which established the ACA’s contraception mandate and defended Planned Parenthood. 
Meanwhile, according to longitudinal research by Guttmacher Institute, restrictions on abortion across different states have almost no effect on the rate at which they occur — they singularly serve to burden and shame women.
We already know, via decades of research and analysis into how access to crucial sexual health resources affect living standards, that defunding Planned Parenthood would very likely be a disaster for low-income women, youth and, essentially, all citizens. The absence of the women’s health organization will probably have long-term, deeply severe consequences on the economy. 
But ultimately, conservatives zealously seeking to defund the
organization are playing themselves: Rather than reduce abortion rates by preventing unwanted pregnancies, eliminating the contraception and education Planned Parenthood provides would produce the opposite effect. And as the aforementioned study revealed, myriad restrictions might decrease safe, legal abortion, but will do nothing to prevent dangerous self-terminations and back-alley operations. 
The point here is not that Planned Parenthood and the courageous, compassionate work they do every day are only justified because on some level, they ironically advance a conservative goal. Planned Parenthood is legitimate and worthy of respect for no other reason than the fact that, objectively speaking, it saves lives and empowers millions of society’s most vulnerable demographics. Defunding it does not serve to help anyone and least of all — whether they believe it or not — conservatives.

If having a baby jeopardizes a college student’s future, as you suggested, then perhaps that college student should consider keeping her legs closed to avoid the possibility altogether.  Never mind the fact that aborting the baby end’s that person’s future right then and there.  Stop being selfish and grow up.
It is not conservative makers who are against the procedure, as you o ut it, but a majority of Americans and people around the world. Abortion as a medical necessity to save the life of the other is one th I g, and most,y agreed on by people. Howver, using abortion as a means of birth control is unacceptable considering today’s methods of birth control that are available today.  Who gave you the right murder your baby?  Women want control over their body, and that’s good. You should be responsible for your actions, but when y I ur actions cause harm to kthers, then y I u have overstepped your rights.
There was a Womens March in January. Another one yesterday. What a joke you gals are. You have been made fools of by your leadership.   You want equal rights for women. You already have that, but you don’t want equal rights for all humans, just yourselves.  That makes you selfish and foolish, easily manipulated.  It’s just a huge travesty that there are millions of females that weren’t allowed to live a good life, have afamily, career, a boyfriend or whatever these days….. abortion, as a means of birth control, is genocide and you, young lady and your peers, if having one, are guilty of murder. 
Instead of being pro qbortion, how about being pro life, and take on the true responsibility of your actions and use proper birth control methods.  There are over 20 methods.  Pick one. It’s not that difficult to make the right decision.  
Very well said.  All very good points.  There’s always too much focus on rights, but not enough on responsibilities.

This week, USC’s Graduate Student Government will open the first known emergency fund for international and undocumented students at an American university. The fund will provide emergency support for students facing revocation of their student visas as a result of the current administration’s actions (including this week’s updated executive order barring the citizens of six Muslim countries from entering the United States) and also enable students who have benefited from the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program to pay the required fees to renew their DACA status (if the program continues). 
As the chief designers of the fund, we feel a need to forthrightly address potential criticisms of this action and to explain why this fund reflects the best traditions of the University of Southern California and of American higher education. 
Colleges and universities rely on the contributions of students, staff and faculty from around the world, regardless of their immigration status, religion or national origin. At USC and countless other universities, these individuals provide the expertise that powers the innovations in social science and science that American citizens rely on in their daily lives. They produce the technologies that make our cities more sustainable and productive, conduct the medical research that results in cures for our diseases and provide solutions to many of the most pressing problems that we face. They also teach our classes, imparting their knowledge and sharing their skills, without checking to see whether their students are of the “correct” religion or possess the “correct” documentation. 
In addition, these students provide much more financial support to public and private universities than they receive from them. According to the Institute of International Education, nearly 70 percent of international students pay tuition entirely out of pocket, contributing billions of dollars that universities use for grant and scholarship aid. In many cases, undocumented and international students — including students from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — provide the necessary revenue that allows needy domestic students to access educational opportunities that would otherwise be out of reach. 
They also give back to our University community in countless other ways. They lead our student groups, participate in our sports teams and contribute their artistic and scientific talent in our classrooms and performance spaces. 
The bottom line is that these students are integral parts of our campus community. Their presence enriches (both literally and figuratively) the experience of all students, including domestic students, who are in no way disadvantaged by giving back to them a small fraction of the financial and moral support that they have provided to this institution for decades. To pit domestic students against international students, arguing that providing additional support to the latter means taking away from the former, is not only ugly and divisive; it is also a lie. 
With this fund, we are demonstrating both our solidarity with and our commitment to our fellow students, staff and faculty who face an unprecedented and un-American assault from forces who seek to obscure the essential contributions that immigrants and refugees have made and continue to make to this country. We will continue to identify and pursue opportunities to stand with them in the months and years to come, mindful of the fact that the Trojan family includes undocumented and Muslim students, and that this University could not and would not be nearly as vibrant or prosperous without them. 
USC Price Student Organization Coalition
Just to be clear, are there faculty and staff teaching or otherwise working at USC without “proper documentation”?  This is decidedly illegal, and presents the University with tremendous legal exposure.  Is this undisclosed “guest contributor” sanctioning this?
Are guest contributors normally permitted to contribute anonymously? Even as one posting comments I prefer to state my name, but certainly someone contributing a column should state their name. In any event, this little piece of defense is in a word, pathetic. Let’s discuss why.
First: It conflates issues of studying internationally with being present in a country illegally. International students, and illegal immigrants are not the same thing. International students must possess a valid student visa in order to study here in the US. This is the law, and has nothing to do with President Trump. Visas can be approved, denied.. and yes, revoked. International students are not necessarily looking to immigrate to the US. Some are; some aren’t. Illegal immigrants are present in the US illegally. There can be many reasons or excuses, but likening illegal immigrants studying at USC to international students at USC is a total insult to the vast majority of international students at USC who applied for and hold valid student visas. Indeed, there can be overlap on this issue if an international student overstays his or her visa… and is thus in the country illegally.
Second: This guest contributor goes on to suggest that the USC community is enriched by everyone, regardless of their religion or “immigration status”… and that they teach our classes, again, regardless of whether they have the correct “documentation”. Really? Is this their position? Because again, the law is very clear about working in the US without the “correct documentation”. It’s called working ILLEGALLY…. and frankly if there are any faculty or staff working at USC without the correct “documentation”, this exposes the University to tremendous liability. Also, same reminder as earlier:
This has been the law for years, and has nothing to do with President Trump or his temporary travel ban.
Finally: This column continues the dishonest and disingenuous rhetoric often used to excuse people here illegally, by willfully confusing issues of legal and illegal immigration (and in this case, issues of immigration with studying internationally). There is no question that immigrants contribute in a variety of positive ways… and that international students enrich our campus and classes. But our country also has laws that govern immigration and international study. The United States welcomes thousands of new citizens who have followed the process of law every year… as well as thousands of students from abroad who have applied for student visas to study at American universities. I know this personally, as I am a first generation immigrant who attended USC, legally, completing lots of additional paperwork every year, providing (among other things) my alien registration number. Will money from the GSG fund also go toward visa application fees of international students studying at USC legally?
Immigration is a privilege, not a right. Studying at USC (as a domestic or international student) is a privilege, not a right. I think we should celebrate and honour the contributions of those who have made sacrifices through following the law, not avoiding it.
Are guest contributors normally permitted to contribute anonymously? Even as one posting comments I prefer to state my name, but certainly someone contributing a column should state their name. In any event, this little piece of defense is in a word, pathetic. Let’s discuss why.

So your lumping ” International and Undocumented ( aka Illegal ) ” Students together ? I thought this was the Daily Trojan not The Daily Californian.
Well-said.  I have been attempting to post my similar thoughts on this issue, but they are being deleted.
