Australian singer-songwriter Vance Joy performed at the Shrine Auditorium as a part of his The Fire and the Flood Tour.  Joy and his band, consisting of three other members, have been touring North America since January and will continue throughout March, until they head to Australia in April. 
“L.A., it’s good to see you, welcome to the Fire and the Flood Tour,” Vance Joy announced as he opened the show.
The venue doors opened at 7 p.m., and after waiting in a long line outside, people rushed in to get as close as possible to the stage. Before Vance hit the stage, he had two opening acts. Jamie Lawson performed first, giving the audience a mellow vibe playing love songs on his acoustic guitar. Following Lawson was Elle King, known for her hit song “Ex’s & Oh’s”, who rocked it out on her banjo and performed with her ever-so-powerful voice. 
Vance Joy finally took the stage, opening with “Mess Is Mine”. A sea of cellphones rose up instantly to take photos and videos of the huge backdrop consisting of “Vance Joy” in marquee lights and Vance himself center stage. Vance played songs from his Dream Your Life Away album, a few off of his EP God Loves You When You’re Dancing, and also surprised the audience with a few others, including OMI’s “Cheerleader”. The younger crowd sang along throughout the night as Joy’s beautiful voice filled the auditorium. The whole crowd was packed tightly together, standing for the entire show. Vance introduced certain songs by explaining why he wrote them, and would then dive right into performing it. Of course, “Riptide”, Joy’s most popular song, was a crowd-pleaser. Orange and red concert lights flashed as all of the good vibrations were felt. He tried to act like the show ended with that, but we all knew he couldn’t get away without playing the song his tour is actually named after. So, back on stage he went, performing “Fire and the Flood”, along with a couple of others, allowing the show to last just a little longer. The simplicity of Joy’s performances, matched with his original voice, allowed for a spectacular night of music not to be forgotten.
Vance Joy is an Australian songwriter who is signed to Atlantic Records. He had the opportunity to open for Taylor Swift’s 1989 world tour in 2015. If you’re a Vance Joy fan, or into the indie-folk-pop genre of music, Joy’s newest song, “Straight Into Your Arms,” is worth listening to.

Twenty-one episodes. Two seasons and a nod at a third. Tens of millions of downloads. One Peabody Award, for one story, told week by week. And no one expected it.
“It’s incredible in the most literal sense of the word,” Julie Snyder, co-creator of Serial and senior producer of This American Life, said Friday at Bovard Auditorium. “We started in Sarah’s basement… and in six weeks we were at five million downloads.”
They expected it to be no pressure – nobody listens to podcasts, right?
“We were hoping for 300,000 listeners,” Sarah Koenig, host and executive producer of Serial, said, going on to explain that the expected crowd was grad students or public radio listeners that know how to use their phones. 
Two years ago, Koenig and Snyder launched season one their now widely-acclaimed podcast Serial, investigating the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee, an 18-year old from Woodlawn High School in Baltimore. Her classmate and ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed was arrested, charged with her murder and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years.
The story and where their investigation would go wasn’t set in stone from the start. Koenig and Snyder had been looking for some kind of spin-off for This American Life. Having pitched a dud to their boss, This American Life host and executive producer Ira Glass, they went a new way.
“We had an idea, but that was not Serial,” Snyder said. “We had done a theme for This American Life called This Week…Sarah and I prepared this whole pitch and we did it at our one and only overnight retreat we’ve ever taken with the show. We’re all in this living room together and there’s a fire…we make our pitch and we’re so enthusiastic and they weren’t into it. [The staff was] picking at the upholstery of the couch, it sucked so much.” 
Though fully intending to work on This Week, after Glass asked if they had anything else, Koenig brought up the idea of a serialized documentary – coming back to the same story week after week. To her surprise, it passed, and they were working on Serial within the week.
“A good idea can be easy because it’s obvious,” Snyder said. “It sort of speaks for itself.”
“Like porn,” Koenig said.
This sort of complementary back-and-forth prevailed through the talk at Bovard, eliciting heartened applause and laughter from the audience. Through stories about reworking the introduction to the show, where Koenig swears she ripped off all of Snyder’s ideas, to their honesty when discussing how they decided to leave in a lot of Koenig’s own musings about the case, Snyder and Koenig kept the crowd with them, just as they had all their many millions of listeners. They were honest in explaining certain creative choices, just as they were honest about not knowing how best to tell the story.
“We wanted Serial to feel like this living, breathing thing that was vital and out in the world that we could be experiencing with the audience,” Snyder said. “The stories are really dense. We need the listeners to understand the significance of the details and we came up with a really genius idea – we should just have Sarah tell us what she thinks.”
After playing a clip of Koenig and Dana Chivvis, producer of Serial, driving around and bantering about the unlikely timeline of events put forth by the state against Adnan, Snyder clarified her point.
“She was really honest about the fact that she didn’t always know what was right,” Snyder said. “It puts you in a really vulnerable position to admit uncertainty…I think it’s a really ballsy thing to do, to be honest in your reporting.”
On the topic of making nonfiction as entertaining as television, Koenig said that that was the only way to get people to come back.
“I think part of what happened with Serial is that, when people listen, the part of their brain that reacts to TV…was lighting up,” Koenig said. “People aren’t used to reacting to journalism that way. What is this? It must be something new.”
Snyder said she liked playing with the artistry on the show, even wanted to borrow certain aesthetics from television, like cliffhangers, music, a “what next” and a “previously on.”
“Artistry is okay as long as you’re sticking to the truth,” Snyder said. 
This is something she said she learned from Glass when making a spot for Public Radio International.
“We should always be looking for the details that reflect life the way it is,” Snyder said. “Try and reflect the world the way it’s really lived. Reporting stories with artistry creates intimacy and empathy. It takes the story from being simply interesting to being meaningful.”
And most of the things they did on Serial worked, leading Koenig and Snyder’s show to the crosshairs of popular culture. People started podcasts about their podcast (The Serial Serial) with their own “previously on” sections; they were parodied on Saturday Night Live; and then there was Reddit.
“They debated and parsed every single godda-n thing,” Koenig said. “Online discussions of the case filled us with anxiety. The rules of Reddit are not our rules.”
Koenig said while reporters carefully consider what information they’re putting out there, the Internet has no accountability – people began posting real names, damaging information, and speculating about real people. The staff felt like they were losing control of the story.
Besides keeping all of the facts straight and presenting a compelling story, Koenig and Snyder faced another challenge – ending the season.
“Ira helped us end it,” Koenig said. “He said, ‘I think it would be great if you guys solved it.’”
Snyder said that they of course wanted to solve the case, but that wasn’t going to happen. What they could do, though, was pose some questions.
“Are we okay with the fact that the prosecution’s story is full of holes?” Snyder said. “That someone’s spending their life in prison based on that story?”
“And how well can you know someone?” Koenig, the one who had to develop a relationship with Syed to tell the story, added. “How can you tell how much someone’s capable of?”
While Koenig cannot in full faith answer her own questions, both Koenig and Snyder are undeterred from telling more stories the way they did Serial. Their second season — investigating the more-publicized case of Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier taken prisoner by the Taliban for nearly five years who came home to mixed public reaction — is on its ninth episode, and they’re not giving up anytime soon.

The Trojans clawed back from a 15-point deficit to take a second-half lead, but could not finish off the comeback in a 76-66 loss to No. 9 Oregon at the Galen Center on Saturday afternoon to wrap up regular season play.
USC (20-11, 9-9) finishes the campaign with a .500 record in conference play while Oregon (25-6, 14-4) clinches first place in the Pac-12.
Doomed by offensive rebounds and poor free throw shooting (64 percent), the Trojans hung tough but could not pull out a win against a top-10 opponent. USC has now dropped 12 straight games to Oregon and ends the season 16-2 at the Galen Center.
“We had a chance to win the game, but we didn’t make any shots,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We missed floaters, layups, wide open 3s, free throws.”
The Trojans sputtered on offense in the second half, shooting just 36 percent and missing all eight of their 3-point attempts.
“Against a good team like Oregon, our defense was good enough to win this game,” Enfield said. “But you have to play on both ends. Our four best shooters [freshman forward Bennie Boatwright, sophomore guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart and junior guard Katin Reinhardt] shot 4-of-19 from the 3-point line and we missed a bunch of free throws.”
Much like the start of the game, the Trojans began the second half on a roll to erase what was a big Oregon advantage. An 8-2 run that included a thunderous dunk by junior guard Julian Jacobs and a tough finish inside by McLaughlin put USC ahead 47-46 early in the half.
But after the two teams exchanged leads over the next few minutes, the Ducks went on a run to take a lead they would not relinquish. Sophomore guard Casey Benson hit a 3-pointer to put Oregon ahead 63-56 and another make from distance by senior forward Dwayne Benjamin put the game away, giving the Ducks a double-digit advantage with under two minutes to play.
The Trojans picked the wrong time for a scoring drought of almost three minutes, as they shot just 1-of-8 from the field at one juncture down the stretch.
“If you’re not making shots offensively, you need to defend in order to stay in the game,” junior forward Nikola Jovanovic said. “That’s what we did for most of the game. We had stretches where we weren’t able to score. It’s just basketball, it happens.”
Jovanovic and Reinhardt both finished with 12 points to lead the Trojans, while McLaughlin had 10. Freshman guard Tyler Dorsey led the Ducks with a game-high 19 points.
The Trojans started off hot as senior Strahinj Gavrilovic, who got the start on Senior Day, scored the first four points before checking out for Boatwright. USC took a 9-2 lead to open the game and freshman forward Chimezie Metu brought some energy with a couple of dunks.
But the momentum was short-lived, as the Ducks heated up behind senior forward Elgin Cook, who had 13 points in the first half. An 11-0 run put Oregon ahead 20-15 as the Ducks shot 59 percent from the field in the half. They extended their lead to 11 with under seven minutes to play.
Meanwhile, the Trojans struggled on defense and went on several scoring droughts of three-plus minutes. Their largest deficit was 15 at 37-22 but USC managed to claw back within single digits by halftime. Boatwright knocked down a three to cut the lead to 42-34 and the Men of Troy went into the locker room down by seven.
The first half was interrupted for about 20 minutes after the power went out at the Galen Center with 5:27 to play in the half.
“It was weird,” Reinhardt said. “I was playing defense and the lights turned off. I thought it was like the Super Bowl.”
A city grid experiencing a power surge caused the outage, according to a USC spokesperson.
The Trojans will take whatever confidence they can get out of competing with a top-10 team to Las Vegas, where they will begin play in the Pac-12 tournament next Wednesday.
“It’s good that we know we can battle against top 10 teams in the country,” Reinhardt said. “Going into postseason now, we start fresh. It’s a whole new season starting Wednesday for us and we’re really excited about it.”

The Trojans fell to No. 8 Oregon State 63-53 on Friday night, marking the end of the team’s Pac-12 tournament play. Despite rallying several times, the Trojans were unable to outmatch the 3-point shooting to overcome an early deficit.
Oregon State opened the game with a 7-run to jump out to an 8-2 lead within the first three minutes of the game. Despite several strong plays from junior Kristen Simon and sophomore Sadie Edwards, the Trojans were unable to keep up the scoring pace and fell behind 18-8. 
USC chipped away at that lead several times — bringing the score within 6 several times — but consistent 3 shots from Oregon State disrupted the Trojans’ rhythm. But the end of the quarter saw the Trojans bounce back, when freshman Aliyah Mazyck sparked an offensive surge. Edwards finished the half with a converted 3-point play, cutting the deficit to only 6 points.
Despite carrying that momentum into the locker room, Oregon State came back with dominating offense to start the second half. After knocking down two 3s and another bucket, the Beavers took a 44-33 lead and held onto it for the rest of the half. Like the first half, the Trojans were able to chip away at Oregon State’s lead, bringing it down to seven or eight points on a few occasions, but it wasn’t enough to keep up against the high-powered Beavers’ shooting.
At the end of the game, Oregon State dropped nine 3s against the Trojans’ three and held USC’s leading scorer Temi Fagbenle to only 10 points and six rebounds. Without Fagbenle producing her normal amount of points, Edwards stepped up to deliver 20 points. 
As a total, the Trojans shot only 38 percent against Oregon State’s 53 percent. The disparity in effectiveness from the floor was the ultimate downfall for the Trojans, as they ended their run in the tournament and fell to 19-13 overall against the highly-ranked Oregon State squad.
