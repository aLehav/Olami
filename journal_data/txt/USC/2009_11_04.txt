The return of running backs junior Joe McKnight and redshirt junior Allen Bradford was a welcome sight Wednesday for a USC team still dealing with a spate of injuries.
Both McKnight and Bradford had been held out earlier with lingering injuries from Saturday’s game against Oregon. But the Trojans’ two leading rushers both ran Wednesday and are on track to play against Arizona State.

McKnight had been battling soreness in his ankle and hamstring earlier in the week.
“It’s still a little sore, but I think it’s better for me to be out here practicing with the team,” McKnight said.
Bradford had also been struggling with a knee injury, but said he felt fine after getting warmed up on Wednesday.
“I couldn’t cut that hard to get upfield, but I think by tomorrow I’m gonna be alright,” Bradford said.
The running backs will be needed against an Arizona State defense that ranks fourth in the country in run defense. Last week against Cal, the Sun Devils held the Golden Bears to 57 yards rushing on 30 carries.
“They swarm as a defense, but we’re ready for that,” Bradford said.
Although the two USC ball carriers have bounced back this week, senior tight end Anthony McCoy appears unable to play on Saturday. He sat out practice Wednesday in street clothes and is still too sore to run.
“I can’t imagine he’s going to bounce back in these last couple of days,” USC coach Pete Carroll said.

Although the USC defense came under fire this week, the Trojans’ offense is also looking for answers heading into the final four games of the season.
“We played just as bad as the defense played,” McKnight said of last week’s game. “It’s a team effort, and we lost as a team.”
Quarterbacks coach and playcaller Jeremy Bates said he was happy with the team’s performance in the first half against Oregon. But after falling behind, the Trojans emphasized the passing game, a decision that Bates said he regrets.
“We have to stay balanced and not try to force big plays,” Bates said. “You can’t start pressing too early, and looking back I thought we pressed too early. If we had stayed with the first-half game plan, I think we would have been better off.”
u
The health status of many USC defenders is still up in the air at this point in the week.
After Carroll said Tuesday that junior linebacker Malcolm Smith would not be able to play this week, the junior participated in non-contact drills on Wednesday.
Smith faces an uphill battle to play against Arizona State, but Carroll said he may have spoken too early about his availability.
“After seeing him today, maybe I was wrong,” Carroll said. “He came out here and got some work done.”
Junior defensive end Everson Griffen sat out of practice and remains questionable for Saturday. Freshman linebacker Jarvis Jones will not be able to play against the Sun Devils, according to Carroll.
I do think think the Trojans will win agaisnt Arizonia State but not easily. Especially since Arizona’s defense will be ready for the running game, it will be hard. The Trojans quaterback will have to step up.
It’s great that USC’s players recovered from there injuries. I think that it’s good that USC got there running backs again. Cause they are going to need them in this week’s game. I wish them good for this week’s game
I think the trojans can easily beat Arizona State. Their backs are good, but they do need a better quarterback. I’m looking forward to the game.

Last season a sleeping giant awoke from within the waters of McDonald’s Swim Stadium, and a roar was once again heard across the Pac-10 — USC swimming and diving is back.
After several years of trying to find its footing under a new coaching staff and a new training regime, the young team finally made a stand. Last season the No. 4 women’s team went undefeated in dual meets until its final battle against No. 2 Stanford.
On your marks · After a good showing at its opening meet against Oregon State, the USC swimming and diving team is ready to dive into the rest of its Pac-10 season. The team faces the Arizona schools next week. - Eric Burse | Daily Trojan
However, the biggest upset was undoubtedly USC’s victory against 2009 NCAA Champion Arizona.
“I’m very excited about the momentum this team has gathered over the summer, and I’m excited to ride that momentum and start getting this team back to the top of NCAAs,” USC coach Dave Salo said.
This season shapes up to be full of major challenges for the men and women of Troy, the most immediate being next weekend’s dual meet against Arizona, who will be out for redemption.
“I was standing on the pool deck at USC getting my fanny kicked,” Arizona coach Frank Busch told the Arizona Daily Star last year following USC’s win. “USC kicked us in the teeth.”
Aside from Arizona, Bay Area rivals Cal and Stanford will once again be among this year’s toughest competitors. Last season the Women of Troy succeeded in silencing the confident No. 1 Golden Bears, yet neither team was able to overthrow the Cardinal.
The loss of last year’s senior class is already showing its effects. At Oregon State, the women’s team lost its first medley relay dual in three years, an event it formerly dominated with All-American seniors Kristen Lahey, Katy Houston, Rebecca Soni and Rachael Waller.
In their absence, it will be this year’s sophomores and the top-rated incoming freshmen class who will be fueling the engine, though their lack of collegiate experience may prove challenging for the young team.
Sophomore Ella Kidron is beginning to show herself worthy of taking over Soni’s breastroke reign, winning both breastroke events in the women’s Pac-10 opener against Oregon State.
The event to watch on the women’s side will be the 200 butterfly starring All-American sophomore Tanya Krisman, All-American transfer junior Lyndsay DePaul, All-American sophomore Katinka Hosszu and freshman Yumi So.
“We have three of the top-10 times in the country,” USC assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said. “That’s going to be a great race.”
The men’s team will be led by an impressive group of international imports. Freshman Richard Charlesworth brings a national title all the way from Great Britain and will be continuing a USC men’s distance tradition that has nurtured Olympians Larsen Jensen and Ous Mellouli.
The French freshman Clement Lefert is a national champion and 2008 Beijing Olympian. Clement’s 100 butterfly will be an event to watch this season, as well as the men’s 200 freestyle featuring Charlesworth, sophomore captain Patrick White and senior Zoltan Povazsay.
“I’m excited about the guys being excited about their potential this season,” Kipp said. “The kids we’re bringing in speaks volumes about what we already had.”
USC diving gains an outstanding asset in freshmen Ariel Rittenhouse, a 2008 Beijing Olympian and long standing member of the USA National Team, who finished fifth on the 3-meter at the Rome World Championships this summer.
“Not only was this result a personal best for her,” USC diving coach Hongping Li said, “but the best individual diving performance for the US in over 15 years.”
All-American sophomore Victoria Ishimatsu will also be a key competitor for the Women of Troy, looking to improve on her already-stellar collegiate reputation after winning the 3-meter diving event at the Pac-10 Championships last year.
All-American sophomore Harrison Jones and junior Steven Starks will be the men to watch in diving this season, both with NCAA Championship experience behind them.
“This is the best team I have coached in 10 years,” Hongping said, reflecting on his 11 years at USC. “We have a combination of talent and depth that we haven’t had before, and I anticipate great things this season.”
The diving team will host its USC Diving Invitational at McDonald’s Swim Stadium this weekend. The Trojans will then travel to the Arizona desert on Nov. 13 and 14 to face the Wildcats and Arizona State.

The strangest part about Saturday’s loss to Oregon wasn’t how it transpired. It was how it felt afterward.
It didn’t feel like just a loss. It felt like a revolution.
Past losses have felt like exactly what they were: unexpected defeats. The loss at Washington six weeks ago was a hiccup, a setback the Trojans could overcome.
Defeats in the past — Oregon State, Stanford and even the loss in Eugene two years ago — felt like unfortunate bumps in the road.
But in the minutes and hours following Saturday’s loss at Oregon, it felt like much more than that. It had the feeling of a coup d’état.
Or, in this case, a coup de Pac.
Before the game, the air was full of uncertainty. USC was confident — and rightfully so, as the reigning king of the conference. But Oregon was confident too.
The Ducks strode into the stadium with the expectation that 60 minutes of football would bring about a changing of the guard. And the royalty had no reason to expect it couldn’t maintain order.
Both sides seemed to know that anything could happen in Oregon, a place where the Trojans’ struggles have been well documented.
And a few short hours later, order gave way to chaos.
Throngs of people packed the concourse and the aisles, and more spilled onto the field. They were there to celebrate, but it seemed like more than just a celebration.
No, they had worked themselves into a frenzy, as if they had just stormed the college football Bastille. Their hands were held high, but each hand was more than a sign of victory. It was a revolutionary pike, with the head of the now-deposed king sitting on top.
As I made my way from the roof of the press box to the space just outside of USC’s locker room, I was engulfed in the frenzy. The crowds impeded my progress, preventing me from hearing what USC coach Pete Carroll said to the media.
When I finally made it there, Carroll had stepped out of the spotlight. He was standing on the side, with a look on his face that said it all.
It was the look of a king who had just seen his throne taken away.
Senior safety Taylor Mays stepped up to speak with the media, and the room hushed. Mays spoke with his usual calmness, answering each question honestly. There was no air of resignation in his voice.
But there was a feeling of upheaval just outside the door.
As he spoke, the crowd outside could be heard roaring and chanting. Each time the door to the room opened, the noise peaked, then faded away as the door closed.
A wave of jubilant Oregon celebration washed over the room each time.
Mays finished, and freshman quarterback Matt Barkley followed.
He, too, was collected when he spoke.
But there was no calm outside. The crowd remained audible through the room’s walls, still chanting and roaring.
The revolutionaries were just outside the door, pikes held high.
A few Tuesdays ago, Carroll made a joke about the silent pauses between questions from the media. But those pauses were no laughing matter on Saturday.
Each pause gave the room an opportunity to hear the celebration outside.
It was as stark a juxtaposition as you will find.
Now the new king sits atop the Pac-10 throne: Oregon. The Ducks are riding high on a wave of success that was simply unthinkable two months ago.
But like every other revolution, this one has a chance of failing.
The overthrown said all the right things following the game. Both Mays and Barkley said they were not out of the conference race just yet.
And two years ago, that was true. The Ducks attempted an uprising in Eugene, Ore., yet circumstances conspired to reinstate the Trojans a few weeks later.
That may not be the case this time around, but kings do return. The Trojans may regain their throne next year.
But for now, Oregon can celebrate its revolution.

Let’s face it: We talk about our sports teams with pride, but our campus food is nothing to boast about.
Ridden with the likes of Taco Bell, Burger King, Carl’s Jr. and other fast food restaurants, USC is not exactly a haven for food lovers. You can only take so much kung pao chicken and pizza before feeling physically sick and gastronomically tired.
How-to · At Zucca Ristorante, an Italian restaurant in Downtown Los Angeles, cooking class students learn how to make pasta dough by hand. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
And though Los Angeles is home to many renowned restaurants, for those of us who don’t own a car, it takes real motivation to brave the public transportation just to get a decent meal on a tight budget.
Fortunately, a day with an executive chef of an esteemed restaurant will get you whipping out gourmet dishes within your own kitchen in no time.
Select restaurants of the Patina Restaurant Group are offering private cooking classes on Saturday mornings. Each class costs $90 per person, and reservations are limited according to the space available in the kitchen. Although the classes are hosted by high-end restaurants, is the price truly worth it?
Zucca Ristorante, located in Downtown Los Angeles, does not usually open for service until 4 p.m., but the doors were wide open at 11 a.m. Saturday morning. A tall, broad-shouldered man greeted the class with a rather charming accent and introduced himself as Chef Lucio Bedon.
“You want to cook anything, tell me, and we can cook it, even if it’s not on the menu,” he said as he gave his students for the day a tour of the kitchen. “We have the whole kitchen, and all these ingredients are yours.”
We immediately spewed out a list of dishes we wanted, and Bedon did not bat an eye.
The next three hours were a flurry of activities. We learned to make fresh pasta by hand, and watched Bedon dimple up gnocchi dough in lightning speed. We watched the pasta chef fold pumpkin tortellonis into pieces of edible origami art, and then messed up several good tortellonis while trying to imitate his nimble fingers.
Next, we taste-tested different types of heirloom tomatoes, and made an insalata caprese — a fresh tomato salad dressed with herb-infused olive oil, reduced balsamic vinegar and topped with a pillow of incredibly fresh and creamy Burrata cheese. After that we moved over to the stoves and spent a leisurely half-hour stirring toasted Arborio rice, onions, white wine, vegetable broth and roasted butternut squash in a big pot to make risotto. The outcome was a luscious, orange, sweet and savory bowl of ultimate food comfort.
By then we were swooning with a food coma, but Bedon was not done with us. He slapped out a whole Mediterranean sea bass, and prepared it two ways. Both were fried until the skin was charred and crispy, but one was doused with white wine, olives, grape tomatoes and fresh thyme; the other was placed over a thick creamy butternut squash sauce with brilliant droplets of green broccoli rabe pesto.
Despite all the high-end food and drink, the best thing about this cooking class was the simplicity and practicality of the whole experience.
You might have tried cooking something other than ramen once or twice. You might even have brushed across organic and sustainable foods from the farmers’ market around our campus. But being right there, next to a chef who clearly knows and loves what he is doing, you can’t help but be infected by the same passion and awareness for good and conscious food.
Bedon stressed the importance of self-confidence: “Cooking isn’t hard. You just have to convince yourself that you can do it.”
In the end, it isn’t just a few recipes you bring home to impress your friends. It’s a transformed attitude toward how food impacts an individual. You might not be whipping out tiramisu everyday, but you will never be able to look at a tomato the same way again.

There are two destinations where dreamers go to pursue wealth and fame: If you’re reading this, you’ve probably chosen Los Angeles. The other city, LA’s older sibling, still serves as a destination for wide-eyed youths yearning to make it big: New York City, which, on this side of the country, can inspire either wonder and excitement or a slew of cuss words.
Of course, as is inevitable with siblings, there is a marked degree of rivalry between the two satellite cities. When simplified to mere snapshots of each other, Los Angeles and New York City represent totally opposite and incompatible ways of life. But as disparate as the cities appear, in some strange and unexpected moments, the two cities can come together in mystical unison.
When Angelenos visit the Big Apple, they expect to find the cliché New York City crafted in Hollywood back lots for films like Ghostbusters, Sex and the City and The Godfather. But surprisingly, a piece of Los Angeles can be found on Broadway, playing full blast in the Brooks Atkinson Theatre.
Tony-nominated jukebox musical Rock of Ages threatened to “melt [my] face” with its songbook filled with mid-to-late ’80s arena rock — the thrusting, soaring kind the entire graduate school and the elder half of the undergraduate population was conceived to.
This hokey musical follows the story of a young, wannabe rocker Drew, played by the disconcertingly tall American Idol alumnus and LA-manufactured quasi-celeb Constantine Maroulis, and his unemployed actor love interest, Sherrie (played by fresh-faced Kerry Butler), who come to Los Angeles from middle America to, expectedly, get famous.
This plot is a familiar motif to New York City-based musicals as well — think of 42nd Street — but Broadway’s take on the Sunset Strip as a lawless, inefficient and hedonistic city where fragile souls can fall by the wayside is a syncretic production of city spirits.
Musicals are synonymous with the New York City character, and seeing that vision of its sister city as a loud, unoriginal but thoroughly pleasurable spectacle blends both cities’ stereotypical characteristics with the aid of some screaming guitar and good old Poison.
Rock of Ages isn’t just a love story, though — Drew and his cronies have to fight against European developers that have bribed corrupt LA politicians in order to knock out Sunset Boulevard’s rock clubs, including the famous one Drew sweeps the floor of, the Bourbon Room. Regina (Lauren Molina), the city’s Berkeley import, rallies her fellow Angelenos to bring the noise and protest the threat to this sacred institutions of binge drinking, inappropriate behavior in bathroom stalls and men with very tight and very sparkly pants.
This image of dated, silly excess as the essence of Los Angeles isn’t new, but the fact that it has been brought to a New York City stage and recognized in the snooty Tony Award circle is an admission to LA’s shared values with New York City. Though the musical’s fluffy yet hopeful show did not garner any Tony wins, the nominations meant an admission that maybe LA culture isn’t so bad.
The two cities have more in common than some of its dwellers would like to admit. There are characteristics that all urban places share, like the poverty, social stratification and age-old grime that pervades the city: graffiti-laden walls.
But it’s New York City’s iconic visual vocabulary that has cemented itself in the minds of society because of its emotional stimulus on the human conscious. It’s a city not built on rock‘n’roll and excess like Los Angeles, but a city with all sorts of people coexisting in cramped quarters and subway schedules, speaking in all sorts of languages at once. We’ve seen and heard New York City as a state of mind, a musical wonder, a runaway’s anonymous oasis and site for natural disaster, horrible crime and as a destructible playground for all sorts of giant monsters, faithfully presented by Hollywood.
Los Angeles and New York City have the same conception of each other as dirty, cracked and decrepit — inferior in some way or another. Los Angeles lacks real culture, while New York City lacks nature; Los Angeles has no organization while New York City has too much. They have theater and opera, while we have faultlines and TV tapings.
But where both cities come together is a love of an entertainment that moves, of images that influence and of symphonies that do their best to transform. We juxtapose the highbrow and lowbrow: The bustling pretzel cart across the way from the New York City Ballet is just like the ubiquitous “death dog” vendor that feed the season-ticket holding execs outside of the Staples Center. The same street musician plays the soundtrack of the end of our nights, a weary, wistful saxophone, guitar or harmonica riffing on a popular song recognized in both cities.
Sure, one man’s elevator is another’s freeway, one coast’s biweekly surf is another’s Central Park jog and one city’s farmers’ market is another’s Dean and Deluca, but the two feed on each other for the stories both cities love to tell to the rest of America. They are the two voices that the country looks to for inspiration.
So play nice, New York City and Los Angeles. No matter how you get to work or what books you read, you’ll find yourself singing along to the same cheesy song, remembering your own dreams and why you chose your city in the first place.
Clare Sayas is a junior majoring in public relations. Her column, “Lost & Found,” runs Thursdays.
The title of this piece is quite telling—any attempt to compare and contrast Los Angeles and New York is ultimately futile. LA is a fragmented collection of many different perceptions, and NYC has four boroughs that are not Manhattan. Summarily comparing the Sunset Strip to Broadway or Times Square is so silly as to be comical.
You’re right about one thing: New York and LA are both dirty and run down. If you want a city where they actually scrape the gum off the sidewalks, go to Chicago.
I’m not sure Rock Of Ages’ Tony Award Nominations meant an admission that maybe LA culture isn’t so bad, as you suggest.  It is the setting for the show, but this show is about the music and the performance, not a statement about Los Angeles one way or the other.  The nominations were about the artistic achievement of the show and its brilliant performers. Fake, plastic and overrated Los Angeles needs to get over itself.

Last year, No. 3 senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson lost in the finals of the ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships.
This time around, the Trojan tandem is looking to bring home the title.
One more try · Senior Robert Farah will take another stab at the doubles National Indoor Intercollegiate title he has fallen short of twice. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
“I feel like we’re a good doubles team indoors. We’ve done well lately, so we come in with some confidence,” Farah said.
The tournament begins Nov. 5 and lasts until Nov. 8 at Yale University in New Haven, Conn. It consists of 16 doubles teams and 32 singles players.
Farah and Johnson earned a berth into the tournament two weeks ago when they defeated Pepperdine’s Bassam Beidas and Alex Llompart in the ITA Regionals championship match.
The duo, however, enter the tournament unseeded after a first-round loss in the All-American Championship tournament in early October.
No. 3 Farah and No. 18 Johnson will also try their luck in singles this weekend. Both players received an entry into the tournament after reaching the semifinal round in singles play at the All-American Championships. Farah is seeded No. 3 in the tournament and Johnson is seeded No. 5.
Last year, Farah lost to Daniel Vallverdu of Miami in the quarterfinals. This is Johnson’s first time playing singles at the tournament, as well as his first time being seeded in a college tournament.
“I’m one of the favorites instead of one of the guys who can pull upsets. It’s kind of nice being the underdog, but I like to be the favorite — extra pressure,” Johnson said.
Johnson was also recently selected to represent the United States at the Master’U BNP Paribas tournament. The tournament is an intercollegiate competition featuring eight countries around the world. He was one of three men selected to represent the United States.
Despite the fact that the USC duo doesn’t see as much indoor action as some other schools, the two don’t feel like they’re at a disadvantage this weekend.
“You hit the ball cleaner indoors and that’s always a plus coming from USC where it’s windy and the sun is in your face,” Farah said. “I can’t pull out the excuse that it’s indoors.”
This weekend, the Trojans hope to enjoy success in singles as well as doubles.  Farah said he hopes he and Johnson will win doubles and both reach the finals in singles.
Johnson also hopes to do well by his teammate and secure the doubles title.
“Robert doesn’t really feel like having three finalist trophies in his room so we’re going to try to get him a win,” Johnson said of Farah, who has lost in the finals twice.
For now, the Trojans are looking to stay focused.
“I just need to maintain the ways I played these past few weeks,” Johnson said. “I’ve been playing really well and I’m just trying to stay at the same level.”
The rest of the Trojans will compete locally this weekend at the Southern California Intercollegiates from Nov. 5 to Nov. 8 at UCLA.
Freshman Joel Giger and sophomore Ben Lankenau will compete in the qualifying rounds. Freshman JT Sundling, No. 5-seeded sophomore Daniel Nguyen, senior Jason McNaughton and No. 5-seeded sophomore Matt Kecki will compete in the main draw.
No. 2-seeded Nguyen and Sundling and Kecki and McNaughton will also team up to compete in the main draw of 16 for doubles.

Oh, how time flies.
It’s been 10-plus years since the three blonde, shaggy-haired brothers known as Hanson left their first musical mark on the world.

“Mmmbop” helped solidify Hanson’s place in the hearts of diehard fans who have stayed resilient over the group’s decade-long career.
Back then the trio’s music, laced in perfect harmonies and ridiculous falsettos, helped define an interesting tween music culture characterized by all-things bubblegum and Total Request Live. Apart from the cheesy choreography and clean-cut hairdos, Isaac, Taylor and Zac Hanson always ran astray from pop music’s mainstream formula. A formula of its own, Hanson was the unique complement — part indie, part folksy, part rock and part pop.
But a lot has changed since then. For one, all the band members are now husbands and fathers, which makes the prospect of touring difficult.
“It’s definitely hard, especially when kids get old enough to understand and tell you they miss you. You feel like ‘old dad’ each time you get on the tour bus,” said Taylor Hanson, the group’s lead vocalist.
For the brothers, the pathway to musical success hasn’t always been easy. Even with respectable sales of the band’s debut album, Hanson fell victim to diffused record labels and later, in-fighting with executives over creative control. While other groups took off, Hanson’s music stalled.
But Isaac, Taylor and Zachary never completely left the scene.  With four studio albums and three Grammy nominations already under its belt, Hanson is busy at work on its fifth CD, due out spring 2010. Currently, the Tulsa, Okla. natives are traveling the country opposite rock band HelloGoodbye on the Use Your Sole Tour presented by Toms Shoes. The trio will play in Los Angeles on Saturday.
The brothers’ presence on the tour speaks to Hanson’s fight to stay culturally viable. As veteran rock stars living in a society faced with huge global concerns, a band trip to Africa in the summer of 2007 became a real eye-opener for the brothers.
“We spent some time in Africa not on tour, but just going as guys,” Taylor said. “We saw people who didn’t even have basic needs like shoes or water, and we felt like we should do something about it.”
The band has worked with the shoe company Toms Shoes ever since to help donate thousands of shoes to children in need. They launched the Take The Walk campaign, a series of organized one-mile walk events held before each concert in cities around the world.
Since the start of 2008, together they have completed more than 24,902 miles, a full lap around the globe.
“The charity work that Toms Shoes does is something, as a group, we strongly believe in,” Taylor said. “It really makes you recognize how simple needs can make a big difference and how our generation can be empowered to make change.”
In line with the cause, Hanson will also be debuting a new EP on tour called Stand Up Stand Up, a collection of acoustic versions of songs on its upcoming full-length album. In addition, the EP will include one studio cut, “World’s on Fire,” a politically conscious spitfire of a track that is not only beautifully written but also incredibly well executed. Breathy, impassioned vocals inquire, Do they know the world’s on fire? — meaningful lyrics all to the backing of a light thumping on the drums.
Musically speaking, don’t expect any half-hearted generalities — Hanson’s heart is in it.
“It’s our call to action anthem, and we’re proud of it. It’s a powerful thing to be able to connect a song with a message,” Taylor said. “Everyone faces the challenge of whether to get involved or not. We’re not preaching, just posing the question.”
Adding activism to their résumés, the Hanson brothers have still found time to unwind, let loose and regain focus on the music.
“Being on the road is exciting,” Taylor said. “It gets us pumped to be able to share new music each night with our fans.”
Hanson’s new material justifies the band’s lasting appeal. More than 12 years after “Mmmbop” graced radio airwaves, a dedication to charity and attention to social issues puts Hanson at the forefront of musical and cultural relevance.
Generally good article, but it must be said: there is no falsetto, ridiculous or otherwise, used in “MMMBop”. Taylor Hanson was 13 years old when he recorded that song. Thirteen year old boys naturally have high voices. They do not have to sing in a falsetto voice to achieve that sound. Also: Hanson’s music never stalled. Their sales stalled; not their music.

Why don’t you tell me what’s going on?
One of the reasons that the USC football team has problems adjusting to the adversity of raucous crowds on the road is because the USC athletic administration eradicated the familiarity of performing under adverse conditions during the spring of 2006.
Perhaps some football fans can remember how the Coliseum was “rockin’ and rollin’” during the 2005 USC-Fresno State game. Fresno State had brought a sizable fan base, which was primarily seated in the west end zone visitor section.
Following USC’s loss to Texas in the 2006 Rose Bowl, major changes were made in seating arrangements. To suppress the voices of the opponents, the visiting band and visitor seating section were moved from the west end zone to the upper wasteland corner next to the east end peristyle — far beyond the perimeters of the field.
Without getting input from the very students whose tuition paid their salaries, the athletic administration and Office of Student Affairs exiled the marching band from its seats in the student section to the east end zone bleachers (aka, the sun deck) to be separated and isolated from the very students and fan base it was supposed to be leading, so that the band, with amplification, could “drown out the opposing team’s fans and band,” which were now seated beyond the perimeters of the field anyway.
After filling the vacated band seats with students moved from other levels, the athletic administration then raised the price of the student activity card and offered the vacated student seats to prospective financial donors. By the time student government was notified, the seats had already been sold. (USC students were expected to subsidize their own discrimination.) It was all about exploiting the severed relationship between the student community and the band. Money was more important than self-esteem.
I warned Athletic Director Mike Garrett and USC Marching Band Director Art Bartner that severing the relationship between the student community and the band would create an atmosphere of detachment and ineffectiveness, thus eliminating the 12th-man advantage. I spoke from experience, because the same thing had happened at my undergraduate alma mater five years prior. (My alma mater has since moved the band back to its seats in the stands.)
The band’s amplification is now so tinny, piercing and out-of-sync by the time it hits the student section and seats farther west that it makes Trojan fans want to leave the arena due to headaches — and NOT cheer along — and the band’s sound remains out of sync with the routines being performed by the Song Girls in front of the main student section. If the band needs to be amplified so that its sound reaches the main student cheering section, then perhaps the band shouldn’t have been separated from the student body in the first place.
All of these changes eliminated the rock ‘n’ roll atmosphere that used to be enjoyed in the Coliseum and, instead, created a strange, antiseptic melee that can’t properly prepare the team for raucous crowds on the road.
Those rockin’ and rollin’ times could return to the Coliseum and the football team could be better prepared for adverse conditions on the road, if the athletic administration would admit its mistake and do its best to correct the situation. It’s that simple.

The cultural phenomenon known as slam poetry has been attributed to a man named Marc Smith, who in the late 1980s began performing a new spoken-word style at a poetry dive known as the Green Mill Tavern in Chicago.
Since then, many artists seeking an outlet to express the wins and losses of life have practiced the free-form performance art.
The inkSlam Los Angeles Poetry Festival, which started Wednesday and runs until Saturday, showcases the finest talents in the world of slam poetry. Hosted at the Greenway Court Theater in Los Angeles, the festival offers six instructional workshops for those interested in cultivating a propensity for the art form.
The event also presents eight of the nation’s elite slam teams and places them in competition with one another in an effort to highlight the purity of poetry.
“The festival acts as a marketing tool for poetry because its possibilities are often misunderstood,” said Shihan Van Clief, a slam poet and director of inkSlam.
The intrigue surrounding slam poetry stems from its service as an alternative to the academic poetry standards familiar to those who have ever taken an English class or studied literature.
The art form advocates a newfound interest in the struggling world of written verse, providing a more accessible and musical channel to the world’s youth. Its emphasis lies in the belief that its performance basis provides a surrogate for those disillusioned with traditional forms and that the intensity of live recitals lends more insight to the poet’s inherent emotion.
“Even Shakespeare, perhaps the world’s most recognized writer, meant for his work to be performed. That is what slam tries to achieve,” Van Clief said.
Though inkSlam has been the brainchild of Van Clief and his colleagues for a number of years, this is the first year the Los Angeles Poetry Festival has included slam poetry in the schedule. In fact, as there have been few events of its kind and enormity in Los Angeles, this will be the city’s first structured taste of the medium.
It is not a surprise, then, that almost none of the event’s coordinators, artists or presenters hail from Los Angeles. The poets scheduled to perform at the showcase come from many different urban regions around the United States, from New York to Seattle, and, as a result, their work encompasses varying life stories and backgrounds (as well as reasons for arriving at their poetic calling).
But the general message of their words highlights social consciousness and cultural progressivism while commenting on the struggles of personal and interpersonal relationships.
The renowned teams and individuals go by names indicative of their passion and hometowns: Bluz and Slam Charlotte, Marc My Words, Shawn Nercity Gullat and Bay City All Stars, Chris Wilson and Elevated!, Judah1 and Empire Mindstate, NYC and Team Whitman.
Van Clief says that the arrival of slam poetry in Los Angeles will bring genuine heart and emotion to a city artistically starving from its emphasis on vanity.
“Los Angeles is a city that has a strong basis in the idea of image. InkSlam is meant to bring an art form to a city that really needs it,” Van Clief said.
Because slam poetry’s widespread recognition grew through shows like HBO’s Def Poetry, which was hosted by hip-hop musician Mos Def, the art form has often been acquainted in the media as a separate branch of hip-hop culture. This indication has also been formed as many of slam poetry’s proponents and champions speak of urban issues and cultural strife.
But what is seen as influenced by rap music, Van Clief asserts, is a summation of the struggle and dangers of life experience.
“Slam poets speak from life experience and find inspiration from real emotion,” Van Clief said.
Great work, Juliani! :D

On Monday, USC President Steven B. Sample announced his retirement in August, bringing an end to a 19-year tenure marked by great achievement in the academic, athletic and financial profiles of the university.
The progress made under Sample’s leadership is easily quantifiable — the school’s ranking has risen from 51st to a highly respectable 26th in the hallowed US News & World’s annual college rankings, increased it’s endowment to nearly $4 billion pre-recession and decreased admissions rates in a manner that mirrors the exclusivity of some of the city’s high-end nightclubs.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
In short, Sample’s departure will undoubtedly leave the proverbial huge shoes for his replacement to fill.
Sample’s retirement, will quickly shift the focus from a look at his Herculean list of accomplishments to questions surrounding the appointment of his successor.
The university has set a May deadline to decide on a replacement for Sample, giving the Board of Trustees seven months to complete the arduous task of appointing the 11th president of USC.
As the process matures, a list of names will come to the forefront and emerge as front-runners for the position. From there, it’s obvious that a tough decision will have to be made.
While the onus can and should rest in the laps of the university trustees, who better to help than the students who will feel the effects of every decision made by the university president?
With chants of “Yes we can!” still freshly resonating in our ears following the giant groundswell of youth support in the 2008 presidential election, it would behoove committee members to allow students to have an input in the selection process.
After all, without the nearly 34,000 faces that make up the student body, there would be no need for a university president.
Although there are few specifics on how the search process will be conducted, it does not appear very likely that the university’s Board of Trustees would open up the floodgates to a torrent of student opinion.
This comes as little surprise, seeing how students had no role in the hiring process of any of the athletic department’s recent coaching searches; it seems foolish to assume that a presidential employment search would be any more accessible.
Perhaps it’s with good reason — few could argue that the general undergraduate population would be a proper evaluator of administrative competency. The people best qualified to make an informed decision would be those who interacted with the president on a regular basis, ruling out the vast majority of the student population.
Realistically, though, what’s the worst that could happen if student voices chimed into the conversation?
While maintaining a healthy relationship with the student body only constitutes a portion of the overall duties of any university president, ultimately all administrative decisions to improve the standing and reputation of the university as a whole will reflect upon its students.
Further, there’s no surefire formula to predict a president’s success. In sifting through a pool of those with backgrounds in higher education, we can only hope to find a candidate that appears to be the most prepared to handle the smorgasbord of jobs and responsibilities associated with the position.
Despite accumulating a trophy case of accolades during his career, Sample himself started off better known for his work in the field of electrical engineering before serving as president of SUNY Buffalo.
Ultimately, only responses to the uncontrollable, wild-card elements that occur during the next president’s tenure will come to reveal his or her true value as a leader, not unlike measuring the value of the president of the United States.
Along the same lines, although many see the popular vote system of the presidential election as a sham and incapable of truly influencing the eventual decisions of the electoral college, voters still flock to the polls, preferring to have their say than find themselves disenfranchised.
Students have arguably enough of a financial stake in the university by way of the tuition paid every year, so one might even be as bold as to channel the “taxation without representation” sentiment of the American Revolution to argue for the inclusion of a student voice in the decision-making process.
It is clear the student body should not have the last word on the selection process. The Board of Trustees tasked with preserving the welfare of the university is more than sufficiently capable of making decisions in the best net interest of all parties involved.
But if the task of finding a suitable replacement for Sample truly is the long and winding uphill climb that it appears to be, wouldn’t it be better to have some company?

As the 2010 election season gears up in California, two other big names threw their hats in the race on Wednesday.
USC’s College of Letters, Arts & Sciences has teamed up with the Los Angeles Times to sponsor six polls of California residents throughout the 2010 election season, when a governor and US senator will be elected.
The polls, which begin Sunday, will be called the “University of Southern California College of Letters, Arts & Sciences/Los Angeles Times Poll,” according to a press release.
The release also called this “the first such cooperative venture of this magnitude.”
“We are extremely pleased to team up with The Times to offer in-depth insight and analysis of the historic 2010 campaign,” Howard Gillman, dean of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, said in a statement. “The partnership will provide unique experiential learning opportunities for USC college students, and will also enhance the ability of our faculty to address issues that are critical to California’s future.”
According to the Times, the paper disbanded its in-house polling unit in 2008.

The USC College Republicans’ decision to bring David Horowitz, a conservative writer and activist, to campus sparked controversy from the moment it was announced, but the outcry ramped up this week when some students were denied admission to tonight’s event.
The College Republicans, who are hosting the private event, are denying admission to around 30 students affiliated with specific student organizations, including Students for Justice in Palestine and the Progressive Alliance. Alexa Ekman, president of the USC College Republicans, said the group decided to ban certain students because they were worried about potential protests.
Ekman said the College Republicans has obtained copies of emails that made the organization feel there was a real danger of physical or verbal protest by members of SJP and other groups during the event.
Ekman wouldn’t say exactly why she believed a protest might ensue. She did, however, reference an Facebook message that was sent to members of SJP from the group’s president, Alex Shams.
The email tells SJP members, “The fact that a USC student group is bringing this kind of racist trash to speak at our school is absolutely unacceptable, and it is up to us as students to resist it. Students for Justice in Palestine has voted to oppose this speaker in any way possible, and I am now calling on you to help us figure out how to respond.”
In light of this message, Ekman said College Republicans was concerned.
“We’re worried about our event and the people attending and our speaker,” Ekman said. “We do have reason to believe that there is a threat of opposition, whether it is by words or via violence.”
Shams, a senior majoring in international relations, said he is angry about the choice of speaker because of Horowitz’s conservative principles, which often target Islam.
“Right now, the USC College Republicans is bringing a man who is a very vocal and famous racist and Islamophobe who has in the past come to campuses across the country and targeted students in a similar way with his hate speech,” he said.
But no verbal or physical protest was ever planned, Shams said.
“That protest wasn’t supposed to disruptive at all. It was supposed to be silent,” he said.
Leena Ali, a second-year neuroscience Ph.D. student and a member of SJP, said only a silent protest was planned.
“We weren’t going to shout anything; we were going to get up and turn our backs,” she said.
But Ekman insisted there was a real threat of a protest at the event.
“They have shown active involvement in preparation to protest our speaker, and [we] feel that the reasons above justify their denial to our event,” Ekman wrote in an email.
She emphasized, however, that it is not the protest that concerns USC College Republicans, but the way in which it might be conducted.
“We are fine with their protest,” she said. “We welcome their opinions and ideas, [but] not to the speaker on our time, and at our event that we paid for, in a disrespectful manner.”
Shams accused the College Republicans of denying anyone with a “Muslim-sounding” name entrance to the event, but Ekman denied that claim. Many members of Students for Justice in Palestine are Muslim.
“We are not letting anybody in those [specific] groups in. It has nothing to do with racial profiling,” she said. “We spoke with Heather Larabee, [assistant dean of students and director of Campus Activities], and we told her exactly what we’re doing, so we’re in the clear.”
Larabee did not return calls asking for comment.
Ekman said the USC College Republicans are using Facebook to determine if students are associated with SJP or the Progressive Alliance and emailing these students to tell them they will not be allowed to attend the event.
“This is event is entirely privately funded, and thus USC College Republicans reserves the right to deny entrance to anyone for any reason,” the email reads. “The rhetoric utilized by students opposed to this event has given USC College Republicans extreme concern regarding the safety of our speaker and all those in attendance of the event. We have excluded your names from the RSVP list. Please do not attempt to attend our event, as you will be denied entrance.”
The College Republicans did not attempt to talk to members of SJP before the event in order to find a compromise between the two groups, because SJP and USC Progressive Alliance demonstrated they did not want to make amends with the College Republicans, Ekman said.
“[The USC Progressive Alliance made] fliers that pretend to be from our club and are inflammatory and derogatory and are types of slander,” she said. “By putting those words in our mouth, they have usurped their rights to have attendance to our event because they are not respectful at all.”
On his blog, Horowitz addressed the creation of the fliers, which were titled, “Hate Muslims? So Do We!!” and refuted the Progressive Alliance’s claims that he is a racist, saying they misquoted him.
Horowitz wrote that the Progressive Alliance flier attributed a quote to him which was “entirely invented” and “represent[s] nothing” that he has ever written.
Despite the controversy, Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said one of the benefits USC students receive is the opportunity to hear speakers of a wide range of ideas and opinions.
“Horowitz is certainly a very provocative speaker, but his is one voice of many in the debate over the future of the Middle East that has right to be heard,” he said.
How many times does it need to be pointed out:  Islam is NOT a “race”.  Islam is a religion.
Calling someone who calls Islam a supremacist religion does NOT make that person a “racist”.
Mohammed treated non-Muslims with contempt.  He forced them to convert to Islam, or forced them to pay a special tax that only non-Muslims had to pay, or if neither of these tactics worked he killed non-Muslims.
Mohammed waged many battles against non-Muslims.  This is easy to prove as stories of these battles and the sadistic actions Mohammed and his men participated in can be found in the Koran.  These stories are FROM the Koran.  David Horowitz did NOT make them up.
Mohammed taught his followers to force non-Muslims to convert, or to become second-class citizens, or to be killed if they did not convert or pay the special “non-Muslim” tax.  By the time of Mohammed’s death almost the entire Arabian Peninsula had been “cleansed” of all non-Muslims.  (Today this would be called “genocide.)
Islam is NOT a race.  It is a relibion.  It IS a supremacist religion which considers all others to be inferior.  This is what Horowitz said.
As a Mexican-American who identifies as a Republican, i find this kind of race based hate mongering as repulsive as it is unconstructive. This is exactly the kind of thing that is making the Republican Party less and less appealing to Americans, we need to return to the Repulblican Party of old, the party that protects civil liberties, that limits federal governmental powers while upholding states rights, that promotes the free market economy instead of making it an “old boys'” club. I hope the CR get their act together. : D
This is what a colleague of David Horowitz faced when speaking in London:
http://www.jihadwatch.org/2009/10/uk-muslim-protesters-threaten-geert-wilders-well-have-his-head.html
Is it any wonder the responisble college republicans are plocing who gains entry to Horowtiz’s lecture?
Sort of like the TSA looking out for the next Mohammed Atta.
If you want to talk about slander, how about the fact that the David Horowitz Freedom Center ran an ad in the UCSB campus paper claiming that the Muslim Student Association was a radical political group founded by the godfather of Al Qaeda and Hamas, what was this accusation based on, simply because they were muslim?
He started an organization called Discover the Networks that purports to keep tabs on leftist individuals and organizations because they may be in fact supporting Islamic terrorism.
So tell me how much of a benefit can students possibly derive from a speech from this guy? His parents were members of the communist party and ironcially if he were around back then he would most likely be part of the McCarthy mob that would have blacklisted them and even worse accused them of espionage and called for their deaths.
This is absurd. Not only because of the comments that Horowitz has made concerning other ethnic groups, but the fact that the GOP party can endorse this type of speaker/behavior. First Ann Coulter a few years back, and now this? The next thing I’ll read in the DT will be about Rush Limbaugh spreading his foolishness all over Bovard Auditorium. Ugh.
This is an outrage. If you want to associate/endorse this crap, then go off campus and don’t even think about using funds raised from USG towards paying your speaker/renting a venue to support this. I have been to several of the Unruh Institute’s events, and I really enjoyed them. Therefore, Mr. Schnur’s comment surprises me. No, he didn’t directly endorse it, and yes, we should be open to a variety of speakers at USC, but this is really just poor, poor taste. Surely there aren’t more conservative figures out there that are controversial for their concrete, well-reasoned points of view about the ME and not necessarily for the xenophobic comments they make?
To all of the sensible conservative Trojans out there, I know you’re there! Stand up and represent your party. Give Ms. Ekman a run for her money, and start your own Young Republicans club, as this is NOT how the face of the GOP should look at USC. The application of the label “conservative” should NOT be synonymous with racism and xenophobia, but inviting this speaker to campus convinces people otherwise.
…As for the right to peacefully protest: Why not?
I remember the controversy when Dr. Norman Finkelstein spoke on campus. He was also characterized as disseminating hate speech but was actually well-received by those in attendance. I saw Mr. Horowitz speak here at USC before on a panel with Yaron Brook discussiing the Mohammad cartoon controvery. He was often challenged on his assertions but was treated courteously throughout as I recall.
Maybe student groups could work together on events to pair some of the more provacative speakers so that a semblance of balance and the opportunity for rebuttal might diffuse some of the outrage that scheduling such individuals often engenders.
To reiterate one more time, the College Republicans only made the decision to limit who could attend based on past experiences Horowitz has faced when invited to and addressing college audiences.
Unfortunately Horowitz has often been met by Muslims and leftists who have shouted him off stage, and NOT given him the opportunity to freely speak.
Horowitz may not be right, or he may be perfectly right.  His words may be hateful, or they may be spot on.  In either case, he deserves the right and respect to share his words openly without being drowned out by a bunch of idiots who do NOT believe in an indiviual’s right to free speech.  This is all the College Republicans have decided to do because they knew to do otherwise would play into the hands of the real hate-mongers.
The ENTIRE LIST of SJP is restricted from the event. And only RSVP’d guests will be permitted inside. It is a privately funded event, and the CR’s are reserving their right to restrict entrance to potentially disruptive attendees who refuse to listen to what Horowitz has to say.
To say that CR’s hate Muslims or any race is a sweeping accusation prompted by ignorance and hate.
I pity those who look at this article and believe that the CR’s are inhibiting others right to free speech. In fact it is quite the opposite, and your comments that this should be shut down or the President of the club arrested is proof. They are not trying to stop protesting, they just do not want it to be done in a disruptive and disrespectful way to the speaker. And why would they let someone in to the event who they know is going to try to be disruptive?
Has anyone looked into what Horowitz actually talks about? Or are you all taking these out of context quotes at face value as fact. Anyone who does read what he has to say will know that he is not a racist, however, he is against fanatical hate speech, which I believe we have seen plenty of from the Progressive Alliance’s posters. Thank you all for proving his point.
unless the College Republicans are planning on paying USC for use of the space as well as electricity and other infrastructure costs, this event is far from “privately funded” thus, the CR claims about policing entry based on that fact are baseless.
CR has the right to refuse entry to whoever they please because they are not using USC funds for the event, they do not have the right to deny entry to USC students on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion.  This is a violation of SCampus, and the onus to prove that they are not using racial, ethnic, and religious discrimination to deny access to the event to Arab and Muslim USC students needs to be proven by CR.
Students with Anglo names that are members of the SJP Facebook group were not denied RSVP status.  Muslim and Arab students that are not members of the SJP Facebook group were denied access.  So what CR is claiming is not ever remotely accurate.
College Republicans is claiming to be advocates of free speech for themselves while doing everything in their power to suppress the rights of free speech of others.  Also, College Republicans wants a one-sided event with no debate, disagreement, discussion, or constructive criticisms.
If College Republicans is confident in their position, they should not be afraid of people that disagree with them.
The Omar Barghouti event on Monday evening about Palestine and Israel included the Israel Studies Chair of UCLA as a respondent so that the event was not entirely one sided and there would be academic debate and disagreement.  I challenge College Republicans to try to match the same standard for themselves instead of being cowards who are too afraid to have their own viewpoints challenged publicly at their own event.
The banned groups do not believe in free speech.
Why should they be permitted to attend if their only intent is to suppress the free expression of ideas of the invited guest?  We have seen plenty of demonstrations of the type of behavior we could expect, at other campuses.
They are free to protest outside.
The USC College Republicans have chosen to keep certian specific students from entering the event on the grounds that those students have openly said their only intention is to disrupt the speaker. The USC CRs are protecting Horowitz’s  right to speak without disruption. Students who wish to protest may do so freely, outside of the event.
That the anti-Horowitz groups are claiming racial profiling is ridiculous and a slander against  the CRs.
If these groups support freedom of speech they should allow Horowitz to speak, and maybe even try to listen to what he has to say.
Alan Dana
LA Regional Vice Chair – College GOP
Jenny, call Horowitz’s dialogue what you want, but to me, any discourse that involves the demonization of a general sect of people is extremely dangerous, and I think it is negligible of a school with a large Muslim population to allow such dialogue in a campus venue. When speech endangers others, the issue of free speech becomes irrelevant. College Republicans have banned many on fear of David Horowitz’s safety, so why should Muslim students not have the right to register similar grievances regarding a man who comes to campus to stir up xenophobic sentiments? I hear what you’re saying, but I find your defense weak for ignoring these troubling sides of the issue.
Talk about cherry picking your Muslim history, Ali. Yes, all those things did happen, but you completely ignore the positive achievements of Muslims. I’m not going to bother going into similar atrocities from Christian and Jewish history, because it’s neither of us is going to sway the other.
College Republicans is conducting a private event. While it is being held on campus, it is perfectly legitimate for any group to enforce a guest list if their event is being privately funded as SJP could do if they so chose. Furthermore, Shams comments in the DT are slanderous becuase neither SJP nor Progressive Alliance has produced documented, specific evidence of Horowtiz being a racists. I assume that now we live in such an intolerant campus environment that anyone who is a Republican or Conservative and persumably disagress w/Obama, is a racist. Lincoln was a Republican. So was MLK. Learn the facts and history before you make unfounded and false statments that seek to infmlame the student body. Horowitz and his organziaiton, the Freedom Center, will likely take legal action against Shams, SJP, and Progressive Alliance. While there is a disguisting double standard on college campuses that makes it ok for other student organizations to slander College Republicans, the legal system is not plauged by a double standard. Those who actively spread false statments in writing and in publications are comitting the serious legal wrong of slander. And they can expect legal action to be taken against them. I encourage the student body to visit David Horowitz’s Freedom Center website (www.freedomcenter.org) to learn for themsevles what Horowitz and the Freedom Center stand for.
Steve,
I detect a fair bit of hate in your comment.
I do not mean to be glib, just real.  Your comment was what it was: opinionated and harshly judgemental.  Would you say the same thing about Jerimiah Wright?  Or is your knee-jerk opinion aimed soley at the right?
I do not agree with much of what Ann coulter has to say and find some of it offensive.  That said I do agree with some of what she has to say.  The key for me is to TRY to be open minded.  To “TRY” to be open minded is avery hard to do for al of us.  To condemn without thinking is what we’re fighting against, and I include the Republicans who are doing the right thing by bringing a fresh and very different voice to the college debate.  Bravo to them for doing so!  For the rest of us let’s listen and think before trying, judging and convicting.
@ Lindasy.. calm down, your ridiculous
@ “Ali”: There are almost 2 bn muslims and 14 million Jews, if you look at things in relative terms and not abolute terms, Jews have historically caused WAAY more bloodshed then Muslims. From the times of Jesus, to Palestine now. The first testament its self is full of violent claims. Jews believe it is their god given right to take the land of Palestine, and they are doing so by use of force. Jews and Muslims where living side by side peacefully prior to the Israeli Palestinian issue. Take your biased research somewhere else.
PS. I am NOT an anti-Semite, Jews have lost legitimacy in that claim, way too over used.
and do not attack Alex Shams, do not sue anyone. Be civil about this, find some legit claims to attack SJP on and do not coward out and call the big brother, fight this peaceful debate, don’t run away and attack the debater.
@Ali
I would tend to agree with Miles. 1000 years ago, Christians were waging religious wars against Muslims. 500 years ago Christians were waging religious wars against each other. Christians still target women, gay people and Jews. Now we are so fortunate in First World countries that Christian extremists are only bombing abortion clinics (to entirely disregard Third World Christianity).
Yet Republicans focus exclusively on human rights abuses by Muslims. Why? Republicans are Christians. Even the secular Ayn Rand folks rarely dare to confront Christianity simply because they couldn’t get away with it.
It is entirely hypocritical for Republicans to attack Islam over human rights—their anti-Islamic rhetoric is based instead on Christian norms. This is not to say we cannot criticize Islamic societies; it’s just disingenuous to describe their abuses as inherently Muslim.  
The Republicans young and old are just hate mongers no matter what side of the ledger. They had Ann Coulter last year who is hateful of the Jews so they play no favorites only bringing the worst of the worst to the campus of USC. Their idea of “Fight On” goes the furthest away from the sports area.
Free speech remains a precious, and easily lost, right. USC should be proud that it can host such a wide variety of speakers from around the world in a civilzed, tolerant atmosphere.
As the legendary journalist I.F. Stone noted, “even under the worst dictator, it is not forbidden to agree with him. It is the freedom to disagree that is freedom of speech.”
agreed.
As an alumnus and donor I’ve just made President Sample’s office aware that the use of U.S.C. facilities in a way that prohibits free discussion and speech, as a form of preemptive censorship, not only offends me but will cause me to take my donations to my postgraduate institution.
This issue is not Jew vs. Muslim. I’m neither and frankly think the world would be better off is both groups would peacefully exist. However to ban individuals from a speech on a university campus because they theoretically may be disruptive is not something a high quality institution should allow. If College REpublicans wish to discriminate in this way they need to take their event off campus.
Thank you for making the relevant point. We can bicker all day about Horowitz, the point is, they’re letting him speak on the basis of “free speech” and then preventing those who disagree to attend. I understand they CAN do it because it’s a private event, but it’s just wrong and hypocritical.
To All
From what I have read, there has been a clear intent to disrupt this event. Lets not look beyond what it is, another group trying to disrupt anothers private event. This man clearly costs a lot to get here thus I understand Ekman’s decision to not allow those affiliated with the other group. That makes perfect sense especially after the slander that they sent out which i saw at VKC.
Fight On!!
Miles,
Mohammed was a warrior.  He preached the spread of Islam by whatever means necessary.  Are you caliming this is not true?
Then how do you explain the following?  Are these all examples of a “small, minority sect” as you claim?
Sudan:  Muslims have killed 400,000 and created 2.5 million refugees.
Somalia:  Total anarchy thanks to Muslims.
Thailand:  Over 4,000 Buddhists killed in last four years by Muslims.
India:  Under constant threat from Muslims…Mumbai massacres targeted non-Muslims.
Kashmir:  A hot-zone between Pakistan and India.  Muslims claim Kashmir belings to them despite Hindus presence there fro thousands of years.
Pakistan:  Thousands killed (sunnis by Shia and Shia by Sunnis).
Afghanistan:  Taliban have murdered tens of thousands with the emphasis on helpless women.
Iraq/Iran War:  One million Muslims killed by fellow Muslims, Shia v Sunni and vice-a-versa.
Saudi Arabia:  Shia are second class citizens.  There is not one, single non-Muslim citizen of this country.  Not one.
Yemen:  Several hundred Shias have been killed in the past year by Sunni.
Englan:  several hundred commuters were killed by Muslims.
Spain:  Several hundred commuters were killed by Muslims.
New York City:  Several thousand civilians killed by Muslims.
Beslan Grammar School/Russia:  Over one hundred school children killed by Muslims.
Western China:  Dozens killed by Muslims.
Some of the most ancient Christian communities are under attack…
Egypt:  The ancient Coptic Christian communities are under siege
Iraq:  The anciet Chaldean Christian community is under siege
Nigeria:  Christians in the south are being killed by Muslims.
Malaysi and Indonesia impose limits on Christian’s freedoms.
Bali:  Hundred killed by Muslims at a disco.
Turket:  Today Turkey is 99% Muslim, 1% other religions.  90 Years ago Muslims killed 1.5 million Armenian Christians in the “Armenian Genocide”.
Tell me again how kind and tolerant Muslims are.
Don’t get me wrong.  I’m sure your friends are wonderful.  But the facts ennumerated above are sticky facts, not some fantasy created in a right-winger’s mind.  The Bali disco was bombed.  One million Muslims were killed in the Iraq/Iran War.  Sudan has become a killing field thanks to Islam.  Are you denying these facts?  Why is this so widespread if Islam is a tolerant, peaceful religion?
And Chris & Ali, how can both of you make such sweeping generalizations of predominantly Muslim countries? Similarly, you make a romanticized generalization of Israel, completely ignoring its strong record of war crimes against civilians in recent years.
The issue is not as black and white as you make it out to be. There are dangerous sects of Islam, just as there are dangerous sects of Judaism and virtually all other religions. 9/11 brought us close to one such sect, but in spite of the horrible things that happened on that day, there is no basis to vilify the inhabitants of Muslim nations, the majority of whom are opposed to violence and fundamentalist fascism. Did you miss the protests in Iran?
I have several Muslim friends and they are among the kindest, most diplomatic and peace loving people I know. How dare you write off an entire ethnic population as adherent to religious barbarism.
Yes, I understand that the event is private. The CR can enforce whatever they want, as much as we may disagree with it.
The problem is that USC is allowing CR to use a campus venue when the enforced policy directly contradicts USC’s own written values regarding racial discrimination and tolerance. It’s a moral violation.
You want hatred?  You want freedom of speech?  You want freedom of education?  You want woman’s rights?  Or, do you want a hate-filled supremacist religion instead?
One of Islam’s core tenants is “us versus them”.  Muslims ARE superior.  Non-Muslims are Kafirs, inferior.  Find me one Muslim dominated country where this is NOT so.
Meanwhile, as Islam tightens its grip we get more and more of the following:
Pakistan: Jihadists blow up high school for girls
It is fairly common to see the tribal regions of Pakistan described as “lawless,” as this story does. But while the central government may not have meaningful authority in the area, it is not lawlessness, per se, that is the issue. Instead, it is the imposition by force of Sharia law.
“Militants blow up Pakistan girls school: officials,” from Agence France-Presse, November 1:
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Islamist militants blew up a girls school in Pakistan’s lawless Khyber tribal district Sunday, destroying the building and wounding four people in neighbouring homes, officials said.
Two explosions ripped through the 18-room government high school for girls at Kari Gar village and a boy who watched the premises is missing, possibly kidnapped by the militants, local administration officials said.
“The militants have blown up the school with two blasts and all rooms were demolished,” said administration official Shafeer Ullah.
“Four people in neighbouring houses were also wounded and their homes slightly damaged. We’re still trying to find out what happened to the office boy,” Ullah told AFP.
Another of Khyber’s administrators, Farooq Khan, confirmed the incident.
Islamist militants, who have carved out a strong presence in Pakistan’s semi-autonomous tribal belt on the Afghan border, have destroyed hundreds of schools, mostly for girls, in the northwest of the country in recent years.
Nearly 200 schools were destroyed in the Swat valley alone during a two-year Taliban uprising to enforce sharia law in a district once favoured by Western tourists for its ski slopes and bracing mountain air….
Lindsay is absolutely correct. Alex Shams, you cannot slander another individual is a student newspaper. There are legal consequences to your quote in DT and the flyers you have been distributing. Instead of attacking Horowitz, why don’t you go work for “justice in Palestine?” You won’t becuase your organization is not at it’s core pro-palestinian, it is at it’s core a virulent anti-Israel group which often employs anti-semitic methods. Why don’t we raise the issue of the speaker you brought? Omar Barghouti? He callied for the annihilation of Israel, which is the equivalent of the annihilaition of 6 million jews. Does that number sound familiar? Wake up USC community. Israel stands for peace, and human rights in the Middle East. I dare say if Shams visited Israel he would enjoy far more rights in Israel than in any other country in the Middle East. In all countires besides Israels, non-muslims, women, and homosexuals are denied many rights they enjoy Israel. In some countires, homosexuals are stoned to death for their sexual orientation as are women who to disobey the males in their families. Shams should take a trip to all the countries in the Mid East before he wastes his time calling a pro-Israel speaker a racist.
The is a private events. As such CRs can chose to enforce their guest list any way they choose. They are not receiving one penny from the Univeristy. Furthermore, Horowitz IS NOT  a racist or any other slanderous term these far left groups are calling. It’s interesting how they just say, Horowitz said blah blah but produce no documented quotes. These groups are setting themsevles up for a big, fat slander lawsuit. There are consequences to slandering other individuals. And College Republicans refuses to stand idly by while they are so disguistingly attacked as is their speaker. Before you make infmalatory and untruthful statements in a college newspaper, verify that what you are saying is 100% factual. Otherwise you set youself up for a big fat slander lawsuit. Sure, you think, “I am a student. I don’t have any money to pay?”. Well once you do start working, the court will garnish your wages for years. And that way you will be paying for years, for slandering a speaker and a student organization just becuase you disagree with their political views.
Wow.
Seriously, you fear for the safety of the audience and the speaker? I mean, I totally get the “not wanting disruptions on the speaker’s time,” since you paid for him and all, but don’t get melodramatic. No one is assassinating Horowitz, I would like to believe.
I’m not familiar with the background of this, but I think the College Republicans have entirely overstepped here.  Have a little faith in your fellow students to not assault a visiting speaker.
Weenies.
This is absolutely ABSURD! How can USC permit this kind of racial discrimination on campus?! This has to be reported to the administration by as many people as possible. The USC College Republicans have gone too far with racial profiling this time, and it is irresponsible and shameful of the USC administration to allow them a venue for such segregated events on our campus.
This man needs to be arrested tomorrow, along with this Ekman girl or whatever. These people are dangerous to society. They incite violence and racism.
I am one of a number of Muslim students who is NOT in SJP or any of the above mentioned groups and has been denied to the event out of the concerns of a security threat.
Eckman is lying through her teeth in this article, and I am proof of this.
USC GOP is denying students like me with Muslim-sounding names entry, which is illegal under USC rules.
[…] An article that will run in USC’s Daily Trojan newspaper Tomorrow addresses the USC College Republicans’ decision to keep members of the Students for Justice in Palestine and USC Progressive Alliance who wanted to dis…. […]

If there’s such a thing as law enforcement celebrity, William Bratton tops the A-list. The former chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, who stepped down Saturday after almost seven years of service, is widely credited with revolutionizing law enforcement strategy in Los Angeles and restoring to reputability the once-battered image of its police department.
And that’s quite an impressive résumé, though Bratton might not see it that way. For this policing titan, averting disaster is all in a day’s work.
The Departed · LAPD Chief William Bratton stepped down Saturday, after seven years in which he is credited with revolutionizing the force.- Photo courtesy of LAPD
“I describe myself as a transformative change agent,” Bratton said. “I’m somebody who looks to come into an organization that’s in crisis or in trouble to change it.
“If it’s not in crisis or trouble,” he continued, “I seek to create one, because I’m a great believer that crisis creates a sense of urgency. A sense of urgency creates change at a much faster pace.”
But in Los Angeles, Bratton never needed to create crisis. When he arrived in 2002 to become LAPD’s chief, the crisis was ready and waiting for him.
The LAPD and the city it protected were on the ropes. Gang violence was becoming increasingly dangerous, public funding was sparse and the police department’s image had been heavily dogged by accusations of racism and brutality.
Bratton set out to change all that, and it didn’t take him long. During his seven-year tenure as LAPD chief, overall crime dropped by 30 percent and violent crime, including murders, fell by a staggering 50 percent.
Bratton was particularly in South Los Angeles, home to some of the city’s most infamously crime-ravaged communities — and USC. From 2003 through 2007, LAPD’s South Bureau reported a 30 percent reduction in Part I crime, the category that includes homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, grand theft and arson.
But the numbers are just the culmination of Bratton’s success story. They are the fruit of what most would agree is his greatest tangible legacy — a brand new perspective on enforcing the law. The story of Bratton’s career really begins 3,000 miles to the east, with an idea called CompStat.
CompStat, or the Comparative Statistics system, was born in 1994 during Bratton’s tenure as chief of the New York Police Department. When he arrived in New York that year, he faced a crisis similar to the one he would face in Los Angeles eight years later.
To combat New York’s high crime rates, Bratton decided to focus on rebuilding the broken sociocultural bridges between the police department and many of its low-income and minority citizens, who often felt antagonized by law enforcement.
The new model was rooted in the assumption that successful crime reduction and
quality-of-life improvement depend on understanding localized demographic and social nuance. Under CompStat, more decision-making authority shifts from top-level officers to local precinct commanders, who are more familiar with the specific policing challenges that their communities present.
In New York, Bratton’s CompStat system was an immediate success. Between 1993, the year before Bratton joined NYPD, and 1997, the year after he left, violent crime in New York dropped by nearly 15 percent. Since 1997, as CompStat lives on, that statistic has plummeted further, shedding another 62 percent.
New York was the birthplace of Bratton’s model. But when he took over as chief of LAPD in 2002, he brought his evolving system with him — and looked to make it better.
He and his colleagues have modified the model to account for Los Angeles’ sprawling geography and relative dearth of public monetary resources, Bratton said, but the steps toward his overall vision are the same.
“I try to surround myself with people who share my vision, who have the capacity to set goals,” he explained. “All the ideas aren’t mine — I’m a delegator. I delegate a lot of responsibilities to people. Those people develop our goals. And then we push it further down into the organization, where we find other like-minded people — middle managers — who will embrace the vision. From our goals, they are able to develop the strategies that are going to work in their particular geographic area.”
Bratton’s system — from the vision down to the middle managers — worked for Los Angeles. And as his tenure gives way to new Chief Charlie Beck’s, the community is recognizing it.
In an editorial published on Oct. 18, the Los Angeles Times declared, “Today’s LAPD has topped 10,000 officers for the first time; crime is down; police are using less serious force; and city residents overwhelmingly approve of the department’s work. Those are heartening indicators.”
For Bratton, LAPD’s success ultimately depends on one simple principle: “cops count, police matter.”
It means that, at the end of the day, the key to successful law enforcement is the police officers themselves, and their ability to relate to the complexities of the people and the communities they protect.
And perhaps, above all other things, it is Bratton’s emphasis on personal interactions that has made him so successful in some of Los Angeles’ most conflicted neighborhoods — specifically the one that surrounds USC’s campus.
“One of the things I have to give him credit for is not ignoring South LA,” said John Thomas, a former LAPD officer who now serves as assistant chief of USC’s Department of Public Safety. “He spent a lot of time in South LA building relationships, going to churches, going to community groups. He never stopped going to South LA and making himself accessible, and listening to concerns.”
Over time, Bratton began to understand the most sensitive issues of race and class around USC’s campus — and he, unlike so many others, isn’t afraid to address them head on.
“The reality is that the majority of the crime around your campus is going to be committed by a minority youth — Latino or African-American,” Bratton said. “So that raises a concern among the student body, no matter what you are — African-American, white, Latino, Asian — about the kids from the neighborhood.
“If you reduce crime,” he concluded, “you also reduce that fear of somebody because they look different, or they’re not from your class or your group.”
Thomas, who during his latter LAPD years worked closely with Bratton as his adjutant, learned a great deal from Bratton’s CompStat methods, and, more importantly, his perceptive eye. When Thomas came to work for DPS three years ago, his time with the chief paid off.
Since then, crime on and around campus has been steadily declining, with a 50-percent drop in off-campus robberies. Thomas says he, and the rest of DPS, owe their success to Bratton.
“I’ve been at DPS for three years, and from the day I got there, Bratton’s strategies are what we have been using,” Thomas said. “It’s all CompStat.”
But for Thomas, the chief’s impact is greater than CompStat. It was Bratton, Thomas said, who taught him the importance of seeking out crime in its most intimidating forms — and confronting it head on.
“Working with Bratton taught me you don’t just have to react to crime,” he said. “You can be proactive, and stop it from happening before it occurs.”
As Bratton returns to the East Coast, prepared to bring his unprecedented law enforcement prowess to the private security realm, Beck — his newly appointed successor — certainly has his work cut out for him.

A new student group hopes to move discussion of the Middle East beyond polarized political conflicts to explore culture of the complex region.
The USC Middle East Studies Student Association, which launched last week, is a student-run group affiliated with the university’s Middle East Studies program. The group is trying to raise interest and awareness in all aspects of the region, including its culture, history, religion and language.
Although several other clubs at USC already cater to specific political, religious and ethnic issues related to the region, MESSA will be the first to explore the cultural and intellectual diversity of the entire Middle East.
“I realized there really wasn’t any organization for people interested in the region as a whole,” said Daphne Wu, a senior majoring in history.
Wu co-founded the group with Phil Zager, a senior majoring in economics and international relations, after the two spent last semester in Cairo studying Arabic.
“We hope that people who are interested in the Middle East can come together and have a more open exchange,” Zager said. “I would love to see people talk rather than just take one side; to have dialogue rather than just debate, where you yell at each other over different sides and viewpoints.”
More than a dozen students gathered at the group’s first event Thursday to watch Persepolis, an award-winning animated film about a girl growing up in Iran during the Islamic revolution.
In addition to screening films and bringing in speakers, the group wants to make use of Los Angeles’ diverse population by conducting trips to Middle Eastern restaurants and concerts. It also plans to make contacts with the local communities and host language tables.
For those with an academic interest in the region, MESSA plans to connect students with professors who have contributed research on the field to offer their unique perspectives.
The group is hoping to use its contacts to invite professors from USC, as well as in the region, to hold lectures and seminars about the Middle East.
“We are really focusing on bringing students together with faculty members,” Wu said. “They deal with so many different topics in all different disciplines. And hopefully that way we can get students out of polarized ways of thinking.”
Sarah Gualtieri, an associate professor specializing in Arab-American and modern history, is working closely with MESSA to give students a rounded understanding of the region.
Gualtieri is 	working along with other professors in the Middle East Studies program — an interdisciplinary degree that explores Middle Eastern studies through such diverse fields as economics, religion and language — which expects to maintain a close connection with the student group.
“My goal as faculty adviser to the program is to promote interests in the region, to promote considerations for the diversity, including the diversity of opinions,” Gualtieri said.
The program supported the Persepolis screening by providing funding, and Wu said she expects to continue working with advisers and professors in the program because she wants to promote the program and classes.
While the Middle East is obviously a very conflict-ridden area, I think sometimes that gets too much attention in American media and in college campuses.”
Though MESSA has no particular agenda or bias other than an academic exploration of the region, maintaining a balance of views on what can be sensitive subjects still remains a concern for many members.
“We know bringing some
speakers may upset certain people, and we definitely take that into consideration,” Zager said.
But the point is we want to bring different perspectives, we’re not presenting it as, ‘Here, this guy has the absolute truth,’ it’s just another perspective. We want students to hear something new and think for themselves.”

In the world of espionage, laws mean next to nothing.
The ability to kill effectively without a guilty conscience, however, is everything.
Espionage · In Vince Flynn’s latest thriller, counter-terrorist agent Mitch Rapp must find the culprits responsible for an attack on Washington, DC. - Photo courtesy of Atria
In his 10th novel in the Mitch Rapp series, Pursuit of Honor, best-selling author Vince Flynn delivers a cast of well-defined and realistic characters who must go beyond authority to catch the bad guys.
Pursuit of Honor begins six days after a horrendous terrorist attack on Washington, DC. Rapp, one of the CIA’s best counter-terrorist agents — a nicer way of describing his job of professional assassin — is at a loss for leads on the three culprits. But as a man of action and results, he rarely sits around.
In an interesting twist, the story begins not with a hunt for terrorists, but for Glen Adams, a CIA inspector general who has been leaking government secrets to the press in order to expose what he believes are unjust actions.
In a demonstration of his skills and expertise, Rapp easily captures Adams and takes him to a secure location for interrogation. Flynn provides a unique conflict in this scenario: Although Adams admits to leaking government secrets, it is hard to accept Rapp’s preference to executing him without some sort of due process.
It is a questionable decision; one that sets Rapp apart from other men in his position and a clear reminder of the kind of justice his character stands for. It is especially difficult to accept the decision when Mike Nash, Rapp’s sidekick, speaks out against it and questions his methods.
As a political thriller, Flynn is not afraid to instill conservative ideals in his characters and attack opposing views. In a congressional hearing, Rapp directly challenges the fictional senator of California’s criticism of torture by comparing it with a gruesome description of partial-birth abortion. Political affiliations aside, this is only one of the many ways Rapp’s bold and uncompromising personality drives an entertaining plot.
Legislative hindrances have long been a theme in Flynn’s novels, and Pursuit of Honor challenges it in a more proactive approach. To deal with the red tape, Rapp devises a plan in which Nash receives a medal from the President of the United States and becomes a heroic figurehead for the CIA.
Flynn also builds upon the pathos of the villains with the interwoven subplot of Karim, the self-proclaimed “Lion of Al Qaeda” and the man behind the terrorist attacks in Washington, DC, and his two supporters, Hakim and Ahmed. In his attempt to evade American law enforcement, Karim does not stray far from the typical fanatic: single-minded in his desire to hurt any and all infidels.
Rather, it is Hakim — his childhood best friend — who serves to question their unnecessary killing of innocents. Hakim eventually challenges their relationship by cooperating with the CIA and redeeming himself. Through Hakim’s emotion and choices, Flynn offers a fuller perspective of America’s enemy.
In his search for the terrorists, Rapp spends time in Washington, DC, where he captures a spy in a Russian nightclub, as well as the Bahamas and Santa Maria Island, receiving information from his British and French counterparts. The scenes are elaborate, but efficient, saying only what needs to be said. They shift often enough to keep the mood ever changing.
Surprisingly the book builds slowly toward Karim’s demise, then kicks to the climax. Much of the plot about the terrorists is developed through their in fighting, which does not have any direct connection to Rapp. Perhaps Rapp is too good at his job, because although the final and only confrontation between him and Karim is memorable, it is also quick, sudden, and feels underdone. The book could have benefited from a more gradual conflict between them beforehand.
But Flynn scores high in making the characters matter in a book full of different individuals. He balances a variety of them and for the most part gives each a fairly useful role in advancing the story. While Rapp, Nash and Karim receive most of the attention, the secondary characters, like Nash’s family and ex-Navy Seal Scott Coleman, help add another perspective to the story and provide a balance to Rapp’s brash behavior.

“Are you eating three meals a day?”
Of course you’re not lying to Mom when you answer “yes.” Just because lunch can fit in your pocket and comes in a wrapper does not make it unhealthy, right?
Although substantial meals will always trump food bars from a nutritional and gastronomical standpoint, a good bar can still make a well-rounded snack. But not every bar works the same way.
Unless your geology class involves scaling a mountain, you don’t need all the sugar and carbohydrates found in a Clif bar or PowerBar — their low levels of fat and protein coupled with high carbs and sugar will have you eating a textbook within an hour.
The best bars for a mid-class munchie have higher protein and good fats, to keep you full and give you just enough energy to last until dinner. Rushing to history class after a hard workout? Then snag something with higher protein and carbohydrates to refuel.
Between The Lot and sundry cafes, USC has a stockpile of food bars. Some are great, but others are hardly fit for human consumption. Take a gander at this crash course the next time hunger strikes. If you have to grab a bar, it might as well taste good and not destroy your stomach.
On-Campus Options
Balance Bar: Technically this bar is a good balance of carbs, fat and protein. But the ingredients list is unpronounceable, and your body does not even absorb all the touted vitamins. Taste-wise, Balance Bars taste like Girl Scout cookies — cookies forgotten in a drawer since Girl Scouts wore knee-length skirts.
Larabar: Made just from dates, nuts and whatever other fruits and spices make the flavor of the bar, Larabars come in tasty varieties such as cherry pie and cinnamon roll. In perhaps the highest compliment possible, they taste like their named flavors. These bars are also high in heart-healthy fats and sweetened only with fruit. The protein could be higher, but the fat content will keep you sated through your bio lecture.
Kashi GoLean: All things considered, this is the best bet for an on-campus bar. While more processed than some of the vegan bars, Kashi products are far more natural than most commercial fare. The Kashi GoLean Roll! and Crunchy bars are the best of the lot. Packed with fiber, whole grains and protein, these bars offer a substantial snack and a good energy booster. With flavors such as caramel turtle and chocolate almond, they also assuage a cookie craving.
Pure Protein: Blech! Any protein-hungry weightlifter should just chug some chocolate milk for a perfect post-workout pick-me-up. Pure Protein bars come loaded with sugar alcohols, which, as the bar itself states, may cause “gastrointestinal discomfort.” As far as taste, these bars are dry, medicinal and are no way to reward yourself for benching 280.
Off-Campus Options
Detour Bar: Maybe you don’t give two figs about the bounties of Mother Earth. But if you want a glorified candy bar, you might as well go for the best. Detour protein bars taste just like a Snickers or Twix but are jammed with surprisingly high quality protein. They also come in a lower sugar variety. Lab creations they may be, they will still totally earn you smirking rights over your classmates and their gross Pure Protein bars.
Pure Bar: If you like Larabars, these are another all-natural, vegan, raw and soy-free option. Full of crunchy nuts and chewy fruit, these bars should meet the standard of even the most health-conscious student. Beyond that, the chocolate flavor tastes just like a hearty brownie. The only hang up with Pure Bars is the day you realize that if you weren’t so lazy, you could make them yourself with a food processor and refrigerator.
Pro Bar: Forget the frou-frou little snack bars — Pro Bars are both the manly man and creative artist of the bar world. Despite their brawny package, Pro Bars have an artisanal quality with complex flavors such as cherry pretzel and cocoa pistachio. They are also made from whole ingredients such as rolled oats and almonds, providing healthy fats, carbs and protein. For a lighter snack, check out Pro Bar’s Fruition line.
Perfect Foods Bar: All things considered, these are the closest thing to a perfect food bar. Packed with protein, healthy fat, reasonable carbohydrates and even real minerals, these bars work great as mid-class snack or workout fuel. With a base of peanuts and honey, they will also take your most ferocious peanut butter craving demon and turn it into a purring kitten.
Great review! I haven’t tried hardly any of these (not much of a bar person though). I’ve had a couple LUNA bars before and they’re tasty, though I’m not a fan of the long ingredient list.
What about the Slim Secrets bars that were being sold at the Farmer’s Market last week? Where can I find more of those??
