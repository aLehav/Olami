President Carol Folt announced the establishment of a new Center for Generative AI and Society in a press release Thursday morning. The center will fund research on AI and its impacts — specifically, the innovatory potential and ethical use of generative AI.
“USC is uniquely positioned to understand and influence how this emerging technology is changing the ways we live, work, and play,” Folt said in the press release. “Our 22 schools are longstanding leaders in fields like the creative arts, media, health, education, engineering, and business. Working across disciplines, USC will vigorously explore the intersection of ethics and the use and evolution of gGenerative AI.”
The announcement of the new $10 million center comes just under a month after the Academic Senate Committee on Information Services announced updated instructor guidelines for generative AI use in academic settings Feb. 14. As the industry continues to evolve, with Microsoft’s OpenAI — the creator of ChatGPT  — planning to release GPT-4 later this year, “generative AI has the potential to revolutionize a variety of industries, such as cinema, gaming, journalism, education, and even the next generation of drug therapies,” the press release read.
The center will have two co-directors: Holly Willis, chair of the Media Arts + Practice division of the School of Cinematic Arts and Bill Swartout, chief technology officer of the Viterbi School of Engineering’s Institute for Creative Technologies. A “core group of leaders and faculty” from five schools — the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Rossier School of Education, SCA, Iovine and Young Academy, and Viterbi — also comprises the center’s leadership.
With its research, the center hopes to bolster the University’s potential to launch students into fields that will be revolutionized by generative AI platforms. Senior Vice President of Research and Innovation Ishwar Puri said the center will influence fields such as the arts, media, economy, health care, law and science.
“The genie is out of the bottle, and we’re not going back,” Puri said in the press release. “Our students are going to use this technology, and we need to teach them how to use it responsibly. We want to harness the power of AI for the public good.”

University Park community members and USC students came together on the sidewalks near Norwood Street Elementary School Thursday morning to raise awareness about the long-standing issue of cracked and unsafe sidewalks. 
The demonstration, Norwood Band Aid Activation, hosted by University Park Slow Jams, aimed to encourage community members to document poor infrastructure near Norwood Elementary. Participants placed large, colorful bandages on the sidewalks with QR codes linked to myLA311, Los Angeles’ service request system, to report the issues. 
Public Matters, which founded UPSJ in 2019, leverages art and creativity for civic engagement. Using artistic approaches, UPSJ aims to raise awareness about traffic violence and poor infrastructure around five elementary schools in the University Park community.
“Part of what we want to try to do with our band aid activation is to try to get as many people as possible to report it,” said Reanne Estrada, co-principal and creative director of Public Matters. “And to see if we could have a giant tidal wave of requests to be like, ‘Come on, 50 years [of broken sidewalks] is enough already.’” 
UPSJ works in collaboration with parents from the five elementary schools — Vermont Elementary School, John Mack Elementary School, Lenicia B. Weemes Elementary School, Foshay Learning Center and Norwood Elementary — and is also partnered with Los Angeles Walks, the Sol Price School of Public Policy, USC Kid Watch and USC University Relations. The project is funded in part by the USC Good Neighbors Campaign and USC Arts in Action.
“What we want to do,” Estrada said, “is to take the creative strategies or artistic media, different ways of working, and to bring them to bear on public participation — how we increase people’s participation and their sense of agency over the public realm and their civic processes and advocacy efforts.”
L.A. was the second deadliest city in the United States for pedestrians in 2020, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration compiled by data journalist Henry Hoenig. Last year, 159 pedestrians and cyclists died in collisions with cars, the Los Angeles Times reported in January. Poor infrastructure in University Park — including unclear signage and poorly marked crosswalks — raised concerns that community members are at high risk of injury or death.
“It started in the 1920s,” said David Sloane, a professor of urban planning, policy, history and community health planning. “Urban planners and street engineers really tried to corral and manage pedestrians for the cars, and this is the beginning of auto-centric urbanism, where you focus on trying to make a place for the cars.”
In addition to the threat of unsafe driving, members of the Norwood Elementary community risk injury from tripping on cracked sidewalks. Lilia Garcia, a volunteer at Norwood Elementary and USC Kid Watch, said she fell on two separate occasions because of cracked sidewalks. The second time, Garcia said she “flew off” after tripping on the sidewalk.
“A teacher who saw me fall said,  ‘Oh Miss Lili, you fly! My God!'” Garcia said, through an interpreter. “And, after I fell, I noticed that a lot of other children were falling, too.”
In the past, UPSJ led community members in “Slow Jams” — vibrant parades through crosswalks where participants carried large signs and drawings to remind drivers to slow down. UPSJ has also encouraged community members to conduct “walking audits” — where they would document broken sidewalks or other street hazards — as well as compiled resources into a digital story map and participated in an activity where members cross streets wearing large inflatable balls as commentary on the danger of crossing streets due to reckless driving. 
“L.A. is horrible at fixing what I would call simple infrastructure, so the sidewalks have been bad for a really long time,” Sloane said. “Part of it is that, is it the responsibility of the school? Is it a responsibility of the L.A. [Department of Transportation]? Whenever you have a jurisdictional conflict, things are really hard to do in L.A.”
For now, UPSJ aims to put power back in the hands of the community to resolve safety issues through art and creativity.
“[We] now have a coalition of USC and the neighborhood, which is a really positive thing,” Sloane said. “The really great thing about it is, you have the heft of USC as a major employer, and you have the enthusiasm and the commitment of the neighborhood.”

Just like the two free throws Grant Williams guaranteed he’d make with 0.8 seconds remaining against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Boston Celtics have been disastrously off. I mean, a 5-5 record over the past 10 games is nothing to scoff at, but if you’re trying to command the top seed in an NBA conference, the expectations remain much higher. Thanks to this mediocre stretch, combined with a 16-game Milwaukee Bucks winning streak, the no. 1 spot in the Eastern Conference has changed hands once again.
It could be because of injury, sure, but look at Milwaukee. They added a few more games to their winning streak while two-time MVP forward Giannis Antetokounmpo nursed a knee injury. The Bucks probably could be a playoff team without Antetokounmpo, but luckily they do have him, so that shoots them all the way up to top-three contender status. The Celtics may still have a chance, but it really comes down to the play of Jayson Tatum. Jaylen Brown can and will deliver just like he did in the Finals last year, but Tatum — who is no doubt the better player, mind you — needs to consistently show up in the big moments if he plans on winning a title this year. My gut believes in him, despite my eyes telling me differently.
The Philadelphia 76ers are on Boston’s tail, however, and if Joel Embiid continues to play absolutely out of his mind like he has recently, they have a chance to steal that no. 2 seed. Even the New York Knicks — yes, the Knicks — have been especially hot as of late. Julius Randle has powered New York to a 9-1 record over the past 10 games and elevated the club to the no. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference. At the end of the day, they are still the Knicks, so it’s likely unwise to place any faith in them overtaking the Celtics. However, the odds — as slim as they may be — aren’t zero.
In other pressing news, Memphis Grizzlies superstar guard Ja Morant continues to amaze not just me but the entire basketball world. No, not from his explosive play on the court — but his terrible decision making off of it. Morant flashed a gun on Instagram Live at a nightclub in Denver on March 4 and subsequently became the talk of the league. He may have also punched a teenager in the face last summer, but the gun incident takes priority at the moment. The NBA has since launched an investigation, and Morant may be suspended for as many as 50 games. Morant has since been away from the club, but a 50 game suspension would obviously derail the 3-seeded Grizzlies chances at a title.
I love sports drama as much as the next guy. I feel against the world when I say this, but I particularly love when a team or player is universally hated solely because they annoy other teams. Chris Paul calling a player out for having his jersey untucked? Call it despicable, but I can’t express how much I love his craftiness in that situation. Jared Dudley taunting the 76ers in the playoffs, despite only averaging 4.9 points per game in the regular season? Simply incredible. These moments provide a mere instant of joy for a fan like myself who occasionally grows bored of the monotony of basketball. Sometimes, I want to watch the world burn.
However, this feels different. Everybody, and I mean everybody, hates the Grizzlies and Morant right now, and this time it’s not funny and I do not enjoy this. Why is that? Because what they do feels like a charade. Morant claiming that Memphis is “fine in the West” despite never advancing past the second round in his career rubbed myself and other realistic fans the wrong way. I mean, sure, you can say that, but save that chirping for the season after you at least make it to the conference finals, got it? Then Dillon Brooks had to go and run his mouth about the defending champions Golden State Warriors and future Hall of Famer Draymond Green (argue with a wall). I proudly dislike Golden State, but just to reiterate my point — the Grizzlies have not earned any of this. I love trash talk, and I quite clearly love cutthroat behavior, but you must earn the right to do so. That is my one requirement, and no one, not even the superstar Morant has been given the authority to do so. At least, in my opinion.
Now Morant had to go and record himself brandishing a firearm. That’s got to be an all-timer in the realm of brainless athlete antics. Instead of proving how “unafraid” he is of the rest of the league, the suburban-raised Morant makes a fool out of Memphis once again. If you despise Memphis like the majority of fanbases right now, please continue to do so. I won’t stop you. And if their universal hatred is new to you, then watch that video of Morant on YouTube. I can almost guarantee that you’ll feel the same level of loathing I currently feel. This is a young roster on the rise playing for a franchise that has been titleless for decades now, akin to the 2021 Cincinnati Bengals that captured the hearts of fans everywhere. I want to root for them so badly. If only they’d shut the f–k up.
In my next column, hopefully we can stop talking about Morant. Seriously, this is supposed to be about basketball, not idiotic 23 year olds. We will be less than a month out from playoff basketball, and the race for the final spots will be nearing a sprint to the finish.

The Media, Economics & Entrepreneurship program hosted a panel Wednesday to discuss how the emergence of artificial intelligence is reshaping workforces and presenting ethical challenges in business. Since ChatGPT first opened to the public at the beginning of the year, some students at USC have been using the tool for essays, coding and other assignments.
Gabriel Kahn, professor of professional practice of journalism and co-founder of M{2e}, said he organized the discussion to encourage students to think about the challenges chatbots are expected to pose and to rethink the significance of education.
“[There’s a big question about chatbots, which is:] ‘If you’re letting a chatbot do your homework, what job can you expect to get?’” Kahn said.
The advent of tools like ChatGPT, Kahn said, presents entirely new challenges that “force you to think in new and different ways,” and the AI Forum is an opportunity to have that “conversation in a way that is not just black or white.”
During the panel, three experts in AI technology spoke on the impact of chatbots on future generations. Craig Knoblock, research professor of computer science and spatial sciences and vice dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, gave an overview of where he believes the field is headed.
“We are just seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Knoblock, who currently serves as the executive director of the Information Science Institute, an organization centered on researching AI and machine learning, including natural language, machine translation and information. “We are going to see a lot more opportunities for technology to improve things like medical care. We’re going to see the things that are already out there do much better.”
Gaia Dempsey — founder of 7th Future, a research consultancy centered on AI, augmented reality and Internet of Things technologies — first conducted an impromptu survey on attendees’ attitudes on chatbots in general. More than half of the audience said they were concerned about the changes brought by chatbots like ChatGPT. Noting the audience’s apprehension, she offered a glimpse of hope, discussing a solution she and her team have been working on: simulating possible futures. 
“We use techniques in flowing scenarios, building scenarios and forecasts, to try to come up with concrete future scenarios that we think are grounded in a technical reality, and also flesh out what we think these different futures could look like,” Dempsey said.
Ramsay Brown, chief executive officer of Mission Control (The AI Responsibility Lab), said it was important to maintain a sense of optimism on the development of AI, while still being cognizant of its potential to disrupt industries and replace human jobs. Mission Control helps companies move AI faster while breaking fewer things, dedicating to maximizing the revolutionary gains that AI is bringing the world while minimizing the harms, risks and negative consequences of this transformational technology.
“A lot of people have basically run out of positive visions of the future at large,” Brown said. “One of the things we’re missing is having meaningful, actionable realistic discourse about the remaining major problems we have … the type of work [AI companies] are doing is the cornerstone of that, because you need to have realistic visions of where this is going that is better than today.”
Both Knoblock and Dempsey said there were benefits to having a basic knowledge about AI and its real-world applications, simply due to the high demand at present for such technology. They also encouraged students to explore different fields in AI, such as machine learning and natural language processing, by taking courses in computer science, data science and statistics.
Roy Gantz, a sophomore majoring in public relations who attended the forum, said he had a change of heart about developments in AI following the event.
“I really liked Ramsey’s comment about optimism,” Gantz said. “It’s really true that everything I see is so negative … and it’s important that we try to imagine the best-case scenario, rather than just going straight to the terrifying movie.”

A women-led panel of human rights defenders came together to discuss human rights violations women in Afghanistan face in an online webinar. The event, held on International Women’s Day, was made to be a voice for the Afghan women and raise awareness of the ongoing situation and was sponsored by the American Society of International Law. 
Afghan women deal with gender apartheid in their country, a systematic policy driven by segregation and othering on the basis of gender, said Karima Bennoune, the Louis M. Simes professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School. Bennoune worked with Afghan women human rights defenders to further her study on the Taliban’s discriminatory practices. She said gender apartheid is not just discrimination, but it involves the systemic oppression of women.
“I define [gender apartheid] as a system of governance based on laws or policies,” Bennoune said. “The policy piece is very important vis-à-vis the Taliban which imposes systematic segregation of women and men, and may also systematically exclude women from public spaces and spheres.”
Hannah Garry, a clinical professor of law and founding director of the International Human Rights Clinic at the Gould School of Law, said women and girls have faced huge setbacks since the takeover of the Taliban in August 2021 and their ban on women and girls from attending universities.
“We have seen the Taliban return to its policies and practices of the 1990s in a systematic erasing, othering and removing of women and girls from all public spaces,” Garry said.
Since the 1990s, several experts have described the Taliban’s rule as apartheid. However, the international community has yet to adopt the gender apartheid approach, which would be more effective in countering the violations against women in Afghanistan, Bennoune said.
In the past 18 months, the Taliban has issued 100 decrees limiting women’s education and banning them from voting, going to parks and even seeking a medical doctor in many instances. 
“They are doing everything to put us in the homes and turning Afghanistan into a living concentration camp for many of its citizens,” said Horia Mosadiq, director of the Safety and Risk Mitigation Organization. 
Mosadiq also called for the support of civil society groups and women’s groups within Afghanistan. There were 58 demonstrations and protests in Afghanistan in 2022, resulting in over 60 arrests, detentions, assassinations, attacks and rapes to protestors.
“These are not simply numbers,” Mosadiq said. “These are women who are putting their lives on the line and they are going to the streets and trying to scream their plight to the world. We have to listen.”
The Taliban announced a ban on women working in nongovernmental organizations and international nongovernmental organizations Dec. 24. More than 80,000 Afghan women lost their jobs and over 3 million people face an economic crisis and starvation as a result. 
The goal of these human rights defenders is to encourage countries, world leaders and UN officials to acknowledge gender apartheid as its own label. The UN Human Rights Council has already filed a report addressing the situation in Afghanistan as gender apartheid. Journalists and media sources are also beginning to use the term.
 “The idea is for it to be labeled and framed as what it is,” Garry said. “The whole campaign is really to galvanize action by states and the international community to ostracize and sanction, and to put so much pressure on the Taliban that they reverse their policies.”
Mosadiq also talked about the importance of international sisterhood and the creation of worldwide solidarity. When women were banned from attending universities, male students and teachers opted out. They walked out of classrooms and said they would not come to university without their fellow female students.
Bennoune also spoke about the importance of regional alliances as well as cooperation on the international level.
“This is not a situation that Afghans created alone and they now ask us to help solve,” Bennoune said. “This is a situation that was created transnationally and requires a transnational solution … and consolidated action by the international community.”
Garry commended the women activists for their bravery in the face of the Taliban’s policies.
“It’s really important for us to hear from and be led by the women who are so courageously speaking about this,” Garry said.

Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu secured 38.12% of the vote from a field of five presidential slates Feb. 28, and were elected Undergraduate Student Government President and Vice President, respectively. They ran on a campaign platform they named ACT — an acronym for “Accessibility and Affordability, Community and Transparency.” The Daily Trojan reached out to the incoming presidential slate, along with the incoming USG senators, for interviews regarding their approach to neighborhood relations. 
The notion of “community” is a pressing one for USG as the University continuously looks to improve its relationship with the surrounding University Park neighborhood through efforts like the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, the Neighborhood Academic Initiative and TRiO. Currently USG Senators, Jakatdar and Lu have worked on neighborhood involvement and developed further plans for their tenure, which begins April 4. Several senate projects are in the works currently to involve students in their local community. 
“[The External Affairs Committee] is working on the Restaurant Crawl, which would be able to expose USC students to local businesses and small restaurants around the community and have them support local businesses,” Lu said.
The Senate is also working on involving local community members in a project to make food on campus more inclusive, Jakatdar said.
“I’m working on a project to add halal and kosher tags to foods in USC Dining materials,” Jakatdar said. “In our conversations with some of the stakeholders, they’ve mentioned a lack of diversity in our approved vendors list. So one of the things [involved in that process] is seeing what local businesses we should be bringing in to increase the diversity of the vendors that we have.” 
As their term approaches, Jakatdar and Lu said they are formulating plans to foster neighborhood involvement based on their experience leading similar initiatives. Among those ideas are ways to encourage students to get out into the University Park neighborhood. 
“We want to encourage participation [in the community],” Jakatdar said. “In high school, we used to give out ASB cards which had deals at all the local restaurants, so we are seeing if we can also collaborate with local businesses to encourage that kind of involvement.” 
The 12 candidates elected to the USG Senate were also announced at the Feb. 28 meeting. Among those elected was Halle Schaffer, a sophomore majoring in political science, who wants to prioritize improving what she sees as a negative perception that many USC students have of the neighborhood in which they live. 
“I sense a very negative connotation from USC students about the South [Central] community,” Schaffer said. “There’s a perception that everything is super unsafe and it’s unclean and that you kind of just want to stay in your bubble at USC. And I think our role at USG is to try to bridge that gap and break down these misconceptions and stereotypes of the South [Central] community.”
Among the new senators-elect is Rudra Saigal, a sophomore majoring in economics, who said he wants to utilize USC’s existing student organizations to foster community relationships.
“I would like to work on trying to see if USC can provide more resources and support to RSOs that are already involved a lot with working in the community,” Saigal said. “[These RSOs] have had difficulties with funding, so trying to streamline that process for them, trying to see how USC and USG can best help them.”
Bryan Fernandez, a freshman majoring in political science, wants to connect with local youth through USC athletics in his senate tenure. 
“In the non-big basketball games, it’s pretty empty,” Fernandez said. “I want to see if we can work with athletics to give out some tickets to the South Central community and invite them to campus.”
Above all else, the incoming USG officials encouraged students to get involved and explore their local community. VP-elect Lu praised USC’s weekly farmers market as an example of that.
“Being able to bring in local vendors and have students be able to purchase food and other items are a great way to get the community involved and for students to see the positives that the community has to offer,” Lu said. 
Jakatdar and Lu said they will continue to seek feedback on their community involvement efforts, as well as the rest of their work in office. 
“We’re definitely open to input especially as we kind of formulate our priorities over the next one and a half months,” Jakatdar said.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed the Restaurant Crawl as a Senate project. The External Affairs Committee, which is in charge of the project, is not part of the Senate.

When you enter a room, you’ll first notice two things: the furniture and the people. Whether accentuated by eccentric personalities or rustic chairs hand-carved from pine, the room dazzles, delights and draws you in. But there’s a key difference — people can talk, furniture cannot. People entertain you with stories of where they’ve been, what they’ve seen and who they are. Furniture stays silent and “looks pretty.” It services the people and their needs. 
Growing up in Texas, I often felt like a piece of furniture. Rather than being appreciated as an individual, I frequently found myself pushed aside. It was always “how can you help me with college apps?” never “how are you?” Often “I know Victoria, she’s a National Merit Scholar,” but rarely “let’s catch up, dinner tonight?” When it benefited them, I was invited. Otherwise, I might as well have been an armchair.
The other day, I came across a photo from my freshman year of high school. It was Halloween, and I was dressed as Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim, someone I greatly admire. Even with my Burton hoodie and Lindsey Vonn goggles, my smile in the photo seems a bit … strained. A long press on the live image revealed why: Halfway through the shutter, someone says “ugly” and waves a hand to block the camera. And yet, I kept smiling.
For years, I pursued this vicious definition of “belonging.” I was the president of two clubs and the vice president of another, a four-year varsity choir member and had published biotechnological research. Still, no matter what I did, it was never enough. I was never enough. 
I was a token Texan — a brunette in a sea of blonde, sweatpants in a world of jeans, lambskin instead of cow hide. Whenever it benefited somebody, I was remembered. Otherwise, I faded into the brush.  
Nobody should have to feel that way. It’s a terrible headspace to be in, and if what you’re reading resonates with you, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I can’t tell you what to do or why this is happening. But I can tell you that things will get better.
One. Be patient, not only with time, but with yourself as well. You’re still growing, and it’s bound to be painful. Just because you encounter tough situations, challenging people or lofty expectations doesn’t mean the burden falls entirely on you. It could mean “right people, wrong time” or “wrong people, right time.”
Two. It’s going to be difficult to walk away from the path you had planned and from the people along it, but trust me, it’s for the best. Before you love others, you must first learn to love yourself. Accept yourself not for who you should be, who you can be or who others want you to be, but for who you are. You are enough. 
As someone from Texas, USC is as revitalizing as a spread of warm cornbread and smoky ribs. Not only am I able to pursue my academic interests, I am also able to explore my passions with fresh-minded communities that leave me feeling energized and empowered. During the week, my Google Calendar is decorated with Korean American Student Association, Trojan Scholars Society and American Marketing Association meetings. At nights, I hang out in the Daily Trojan newsroom, and on the weekends you can catch me bombing down Mammoth Mountain with the USC Ski & Snowboard team. I have the most interesting (and questionable) conversations, ranging from “grizzly bear versus silverback gorilla?” to “how many five-year-olds could you fight at once?”
But best of all, I’ve found that I can finally be. 
I may still be a token Texan, but it’s taken on a new connotation. Rather than being a cowboy hat hanging on a wall, I’m riding the bull at the rodeo. I hold the reins to my identity and belonging. And when bucked, I hang on.
So shed that snakeskin, slip on your jeans and shine your spurs. It’s time to get down to the honky-tonk.

The world’s largest hip-hop festival Rolling Loud made history as the first festival to be held at SoFi Stadium Grounds. Tens of thousands of fans gathered throughout the three days to enjoy dozens of artists’ performances. The vibrant digitals contrasting the night sky and stream planes passing overhead as the buzzing crowd awaited some of the biggest names in rap created a vibe unique to SoFi. In signature Rolling Loud style, a number of guests made surprise appearances, boosting the energy of the crowd as they heard their favorite songs, features and all. 
Opening Day acts included fan favorites like Chief Keef, Ski Mask the Slump God and Kodak Black. Attendees got a taste of West Coast sounds with performances by Kamaiyah as well as Tyga, who brought out Compton rapper YG for the track “Go Loko.”
In anticipation of headliner Playboi Carti, artists under his Opium label Destroy Lonely and Ken Carson had successive sets. As soon as Carti came on stage, the crowd’s energy soared — but became too rowdy after three songs, forcing his set to be paused when a crowd injury occurred. He returned to the stage after about half an hour, debuting a new song and closing out day one with his transcendent track “Location.”
Day two acts of Rolling Loud got the weekend function into full swing, bringing a wide range of sounds and energies across all stages and even more unexpected stars to Hollywood Park. As dusk arrived, Young Nudy and City Girls got the crowd charged up at the main stage for the night acts. Don Toliver really got the festival energy up with his set, making the crowd go wild when surprise guest Justin Bieber was brought out during “Private Landing,” a track from Don Toliver’s newest album “Love Sick.” 
Bieber’s appearance was particularly shocking, as just days before he announced the cancellation of the remaining dates of his “Justice World Tour.” Fans were also treated with special guests Kali Uchis and James Blake.
Lil Baby kept the crowd hyped up after Don, starting his set off with “Wants and Needs.” The crowd never wavered in their energy, remaining hyped up as he performed hit after hit, bar for bar. Fans rapped lyrics along with him as he closed with “Freestyle.”
At the other stage, Lil Wayne shut things down with a set full of classic hits from his over 30 years in the rap game. Perhaps one of the most exciting surprises of Saturday was Nicki Minaj accompanying him for “BedRock,” “High School” and “Truffle Butter.” Minaj had intended to perform solo while on stage but experienced issues with her earpiece and stutters in music by the DJ. Despite technical difficulties during the set, the two still managed to put on a legendary show.
Filling the same time slot as Carti on Friday, fans waited for headliner Travis Scott to make his return — Rolling Loud would be his first live festival performance since the tragedy of Astroworld in 2021. Scott’s comeback was brief, only lasting about half an hour due to his late arrival and a hard cut off at 11 p.m. sharp, in the middle of his most popular song “Sicko Mode,” marking an abrupt end to day two. 
On Sunday, sounds of Los Angeles dominated all three stages. OhGeesy, BlueBucksClan, Kalan.FrFr, G Perico and Rucci represented their home turf, bringing some of the city’s favorite songs to the festival’s final day. Sunday also presented some historic moments for rising rap stars. UK rapper Central Cee made his United States festival premiere, and Ice Spice performed “Boy’s a liar Pt. 2” live for the first time during her first ever festival set. Eem Tripplin saw thousands of supporters at his set, an exponential increase from the 13-person crowd he had just five months earlier. 
The final acts threw it down and ended the show with a bang. Lil Yachty had an all-woman band for his set, and his audience heard several tracks from his experimental psych-rock project “Let’s Start Here.” Back at the main stage, Lil Uzi Vert delivered a unique, high-energy performance as his backup dancers jumped in a bouncy castle. Aside from his classics and hottest tracks, he also debuted a few unreleased songs. With these previews of the content of his next album “Pink Tape,” addressed the delay in the drop, telling fans he is putting some final touches to the album and apologizing for making fans wait so long. 
The festival wrapped up with Future, who started his set with the song “712PM” and ended with one of his most iconic songs, “Mask Off.” As he rapped his last lyric, the light drizzles of rain mixed with bright bursts of colorful fireworks overhead as a grateful Future thanked and showed appreciation to his fans for showing out — a sensational end to Rolling Loud California. The festival will pick back up in July, where it will return to its birthplace of Miami before beginning its international leg.

When I moved to Los Angeles for college, I was ecstatic to finally be away from home. I wanted to be away from the safety net of my family and learn all the “college life lessons” I always heard about from my older sister and upperclassmen friends. My hometown began to suffocate me, and I couldn’t wait to move to the big city at the University I worked so hard to get into. Frankly, I had never really been a family-oriented person nor have I ever truly had strong familial values. College seemed like a golden opportunity for freedom and independence. 
The first few months were bliss. I no longer had to constantly worry about a curfew or asking for permission to go out. Simply put, all my decisions were fully my own, and I became less dependent on the constant parental validation I wanted back home. 
The Atlantic writer Alia Wong states, “Many undergrads, especially those who live on campus, are caught in a sort of limbo between dependence and independence, making their own rules and schedules but relying on their parents to help them.” 
Without knowing, the more I had gotten used to my independence and the busier I got with my workload, the less I called home and the less I was present in my family’s lives. I still needed them but as I grew out of that, they faded into the back of my mind. But I soon got a harsh wake-up call: My grandmother had been hospitalized. 
The moment I was told of my grandmother’s condition, an immediate and overwhelming feeling of guilt, regret and panic washed over me. To me, my grandmother is the only pillar and source of unconditional love I unknowingly took for granted. I reflected on how neglectful I was towards my grandmother during breaks and chose to go out with friends, refused to play her favorite game of Go-Stop because “I could always do that later” and how I would never call her when I was back at school because “I could always see her during the break.” 
Family can be a source of strength or pain for many students. But, if you’re lucky enough to have a warm, loving and supportive family, cherishing that relationship and making an effort to show you appreciate them is indispensable. It’s easy to be swept up by all these new responsibilities with the constant stress of having to stay productive or risk falling behind your peers.  
College often involves anticipating every next move of your professors and preparing for the next new opportunity — whether it’s internships, exams, research or the social scene. Time feels limited. We only have four or so years of undergrad and want to look forward and succeed in life. But because time is limited, it’s necessary to take a pause and look back to the place and people you came from, so we don’t lose sight of what’s truly important. We never know what we have until we lose it. It’s not just time at university that is limited, it’s our time with the people around us. 
The time we spend with our loved ones is just as important as that internship, interview or exam. Our families need us, just as much as we need them. 
I could only imagine how much my grandmother’s loneliness was amplified considering how she left everything she knew in South Korea to immigrate to the United States to help my mother raise me. But, without me knowing, I was so caught up in the chaos of college life that I never really took the time to verbalize my appreciation and gratitude for her unconditional support and love. I can always ask for an extension, reschedule an interview and work on that application another time. But, I can never replicate or find my grandmother’s unconditional love anywhere else.
I have always seen sappy Hollywood movies of the protagonist regretting neglecting their family for work and personal growth and brushed it off as glorified nuclear family propaganda, but there’s some truth to those stories. The next time you go home, spend some time with your family. Be in the present and cherish the moments you have with them. Give them a quick call or shoot them a quick text to just let them know you appreciate them. Because when I get back home for spring break, I know I’ll be with my grandmother and giving her my undivided attention.

March is upon us.
As the pinnacle of college basketball is nearing, the Trojans are hopeful they will hear their names called March 12, also known as Selection Sunday.
But before the NCAA tournament is finalized, USC still has to play in the Pac-12 tournament, a four day, bracket-style event in Las Vegas. The Trojans are seeded third in the tournament, behind UCLA and the University of Arizona, meaning they received a first-round bye and did not have to play Wednesday. The team will play its first game Thursday at 8:30 p.m. against the winner of Arizona State, who defeated Oregon State Wednesday night.
“We just played Arizona State, so we’ve watched enough game video on them the last few days … It’s going to be an easy scout because we just played them,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
If the Trojans win their first game, they play their next game less than 24 hours later. The last time USC had to play games on consecutive days was back in November during the Bad Boy Mowers Battle 4 Atlantis, when they played three games in as many days.
Freshman guard Tre White thinks the team will be up to the task, despite having such a short turnaround between games.
“Since the beginning of the season our strength coach, he’s been saying we’ve got to be strong in March. So we’ve really been harping on that,” said White in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think it’s just an accumulation of the things we’ve been doing.”
The Trojans have not had much success in tournaments recently, amassing a 2-4 record over their past three tournaments, including the Battle 4 Atlantis, the 2022 Pac-12 tournament and subsequent 2022 NCAA Tournament.
USC will look to flip the script though, as their team looks much different now than in November. Coming out of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, the Trojans were 4-3 on the season, but have gone 18-6 since.
Part of that success is due to underclassmen becoming more comfortable in larger roles. That comfort has shown up on the stat sheet and through recognition from the Pac-12. White, who averaged 8.9 points per game during the regular season, was recently named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team, while sophomore guard Kobe Johnson was named to the Pac-12 All-Defensive team and sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters was named the Pac-12 Sixth Player of the Year.
“I think everyone’s stepped up,” said fifth year guard Drew Peterson in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think the awards across the board for our team prove that.”
USC will continue to rely on Peterson, who leads the team in rebounds and assists per game, and senior guard Boogie Ellis, who leads the team in points per game. But the two veteran guards have rarely put up high point totals simultaneously. Over USC’s last 10 games, Ellis and Peterson have only scored over 11 points each in the same game four times.
The Trojans have still managed a 7-3 record in those games, but all three of the losses came when only one or neither of the veteran guards reached the 12 point threshold. Peterson, who said he’ll play on Thursday, is still not 100% back from the back injury that almost kept him out of the ASU game. That means USC will need one of their role players to step up during the Pac-12 tournament if they want to advance and become champions.
“We need that third and fourth scorer if we’re going to do something in the postseason,” Enfield said.
Despite all of the question marks of who that third or fourth scorer will be for USC, confidence is still high in the locker room.
“Sky high. I’ve been saying this since the beginning of the year: I feel like we’ve never really lost a game,” White said. “We’ve always shot ourselves in the foot … We’ve been coming together at the perfect time. Keeping that confidence with our resume, I feel like we’re going to do some big things.”
That confidence extends beyond just the Pac-12 tournament.
“We’re playing our best basketball of the year right now,” Peterson said. “We’re really confident and we’ve got good momentum going into the tourney and we’re looking to take care of business there and set us up for potential seeding.”
The Trojans found out they would be playing the Sun Devils fewer than 24 hours before tipoff. But they have high hopes as they match up against conference foes for likely the last time this season.

To the women of comedy who have so inspired me: 
I must start with an apology. Recently, my column has not given you the respect and space you so deserve. As much as I may enjoy the work of those men, it is you who I admire, you who comfort me on a hard day, you who remind me I am not alone. 
While I may make the occasional meninist joke, those are just jokes. I repeat: My claim to be a meninist is a joke! It’s for laughs, for kicks, for giggles. I know that you understand that, and you understand me. You would never question the bit.
Comedy is a way to make friends, pass the time, brighten up the day and cope with the world. None of this would be possible without you. The comedy world is a harsh one, especially for women. I want you to know that your bravery in putting yourself out there does not go unnoticed. To provide the world with joy through humor, you must withstand incredible opposition. Thank you for doing so.
Although there are women everywhere who deserve a shoutout, I want to pay homage to a special few that keep me committing to the bit. 
To Jennette McCurdy, the first person I can remember finding funny: Thank you for introducing me to an entirely new world of hilarity. “iCarly” may have introduced me to you, but I am so grateful to see you get recognized for more. “I’m Glad My Mom Died” was the book of 2022. Your ability to never lose the humor when writing about incredibly vulnerable topics proves the power of comedy. Your literary achievement is one few will ever achieve, and I can’t wait to see what you do next. 
To Melissa Villaseñor, the first Latina on “Saturday Night Live”: Thank you for opening the door for a hopefully much brighter “SNL” future. The memory of watching you do your wonderfully quirky thing at Largo at the Coronet is one I will always cherish. Thank you for using that space to shine a light on Latinas who also deserve their spotlight in the comedy world. Your performance was a highlight of my semester — even though Bill Burr bailed. I was there for you anyways. 
To Chelsea Peretti, truly one of the greats: Thank you for being the best sitcom character of the 2010s. Gina Linetti is the state of mind I try to emulate daily. When I’m down in the dumps, spiraling into a pit of self loathing, I remind myself that Linetti would never let her insecurities stop her from doing anything. Sure, it may border on obnoxious delusion, but who’s to say I’m not also one of the greats? Tackling the day ahead becomes just a little bit more manageable thanks to your work.
To Janelle James, the next sitcom great: Thank you for carrying on the legacy of unwaveringly confident sitcom women. Peretti couldn’t have passed her crown to anybody better. Ava Coleman knows she is the shit. I can see a future where more women can live their Ava Coleman truth, a truth of unapologetic self-assurance. Arrogance is something to be wary of, but Coleman can get a pass thanks to your incredibly loveable portrayal.
To Rose Matafeo, a fellow flat-footed icon: Thank you for your painfully raw relatability. That mirror is not always flattering, but the moments of self-reflection you have provided me are invaluable. Your openness about your obsessive tendencies make me feel less alone. Honestly, everything you do makes me feel less alone. Thanks for just being truly you — the incredibly cool and the not-so cool. 
To Ego Nwodim, one of my favorite “SNL” cast members of all time and a fellow Trojan: Thank you for making those weekly 90 minutes slightly more bearable. Even though I have watched every show in the past 18 seasons, I’m not sure I could carry on without your ability to save floundering sketches. You stay committed to the bit, and I admire you for it. Fight on, Ego.
To Catherine Cohen, my fabulous inspiration: Thank you for being unapologetically obnoxious. You already got an ode from me, but I know you would want more. You deserve more. You deserve the world for the lessons in complete self-confidence you have given me. 
To Fern Brady, the “rightful queen” of both “Taskmaster” and my heart: Thank you for providing me with a multitude of clips that will never fail to make me laugh. No matter how soul crushing my day was, hearing you exclaim “oh no” in your Scottish accent lifts me up. But, most importantly, thank you for your bravery in destigmatizing autism. “Strong Female Character,” the title of your brilliant memoir, doesn’t even begin to describe you.
To Judi Love, for your wonderfully captivating persona: Thank you for your presence in the British comedy world. Thank you for using your platform to bring attention to the misogynoir rampant in society. “Judi Love: Black, Female and Invisible” is one of the finest productions from Channel 4 in a while. You’ve quickly climbed your way to the top of my comedian list. Any time I see you on a panel show lineup, I know it’s one worth watching. You’ve managed to break into my top five “The Big Fat Quiz of the Year” contestants — an incredibly challenging feat that you seemed to do easily. 
And, to all the women I didn’t name: to my wonderful friends, to my mother, to my tías — I love you. 
Thank you for everything.

At first glance, USC’s 8-7 men’s volleyball record isn’t all that noteworthy. After all, the Trojans have already tied its number of losses from last season.
However, underneath the surface, the Trojans have played nine matches against ranked opponents and are the 10th-best team in the country, according to the American Volleyball Coaches Association.
“The iron sharpens iron,” said Head Coach Jeff Nygaard in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We have not had that many easy matches … we’ve been really chomping at the bit and really close on all of them.”
On Thursday and Saturday, USC will face yet another ranked team in No. 7 Pepperdine.  
Freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein leads the Trojans’ offense that is 10th in the nation in kills per set. Klein has 222 kills on the season and is 15th in the nation in kills per set. 
Aside from Klein, redshirt junior outside hitter Simon Gallas is 2nd on the team in kills and 1st in digs per set after winning All-MPSF First Team honors his redshirt sophomore year. 
In the front row, junior middle blocker Kyle Paulson has a team-leading 51 blocks so far despite missing two games. 
“Having trusted my teammates and them having my back as well has really helped me further my game,” Paulson said. “The coaches have been really supportive of technical things like my approach, my footwork and stuff.”
As a team, USC blocks 2.26 balls per set, good for 12th in the country.
“Defense is a good offense,” Klein said. “[We have to] put the ball on the floor, take care of our passes, make smart swings and block well.”
The Trojans will face a Pepperdine team that racks up 13.23 kills per set, the second-highest ratio in the nation. In comparison, the Trojans are 10th in the National Collegiate with 12.26 kills per set.
“They’ve got a really competitive setter in [junior Bryce] Dvorak,” Nygaard said. “He’s going to bring gas from the service line and challenge us there. They’ve got fifth-year senior Jaylen Jasper who elevates at a high point and just hits with some really extreme angles.”
The Waves are 10-8 with a 4-8 record against ranked teams. Jasper has 342 kills, more than double the number of the second-highest scorer on the team, senior outside hitter Akin Akinwumi. Nationally, the Stanford grad has the 2nd-most kills per set.
Meanwhile, Dvorak’s 10.87 assists per set is the highest ratio in the country. The Newport Beach native has 739 assists in 68 sets.
However, Pepperdine’s defense has been a weakness. The team is not in the National Collegiate Top 50 for digs per set nor blocks per set. This season, Pepperdine’s opponents are attacking the Waves at a 31.6% success rate. Meanwhile, the Trojans’ competitors have an attack rate of 27.1% against USC. 
The Trojans are 3-3 at Galen Center and 1-3 away, while the Waves are 6-2 at Firestone Fieldhouse.
“They’re going to have a few weapons on their side of things,” Nygaard said. “So we’re going to go in and just bring our style of volleyball. And I think we’ve got a couple of weapons too, so it’ll be a fun night.
USC will play Pepperdine at Firestone Fieldhouse on Thursday, followed by a match against the Waves at Galen Center Saturday. The first serve will be at 7 p.m. for both games.

Music runs through Sammy Rabinowitz’s veins. Whether he’s playing the drums with his band Dark Trilobite back home in the DC area or taking a USC songwriting class, Rabinowitz brings creative talent and an appetite for perfection to every project. 
“I’ve been in music since before I formed memories … I think it’d be a shame to not pursue my passion,” said Rabinowitz, a freshman majoring in popular music. “I think of a passion as indescribable. It’s the thing that calms your heartbeat down and makes you feel comfortable.”
His newest venture is a solo career: his debut single, “2688 Miles,” was released last Friday. The pop ballad recalls a long-distance relationship Rabinowitz had, the distance between them measuring 2688 miles. 
Rabinowitz invited his friend Ava Ulloa, a freshman majoring in communications at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, to sing “2688 Miles.” Ulloa previously sung on Broadway as Matilda in “Matilda the Musical.”
“I wrote these songs that I fell in love with, and then I would listen to recordings of myself singing them, and I was like, ‘My singing voice is not doing the song justice,’” Rabinowitz said. “That’s how I ended up making decisions like bringing in Ava to sing ‘2688 Miles,’ especially with [it being] my favorite one on the album.”
Rabinowitz also brought on Grayson Pollard, a freshman majoring in music production, to produce the track. 
“I learned a lot this year so far and am still learning about how to give each song what it needs,” Rabinowitz said. “That’s one of the things I’m most proud of, is understanding who to bring in to help execute the vision.”
Pollard turned his dorm into a mini recording studio with instruments and multiple computer monitors, which he lent to making “2688 Miles.”
“I made my closet into a vocal booth,” Pollard said. “I hang clothes everywhere, on the sides of it, so it’s a super damp sound … And then I just have my microphone there, music stand and some headphones, enough to release quality vocals.”
Ulloa recorded the vocals in this makeshift studio over one weekend, taking notes from Rabinowitz and Pollard.
“[Rabinowitz is] not afraid to ask for what he wants if he wants something a specific way, which I really appreciate because I feel like sometimes when you’re friends with someone and you’re collaborating, you get a little nervous to give your full opinion,” Ulloa said. “He’s a really honest guy, and he’s really dedicated to what he does.”
In post-production, Pollard mixed the song, synthesizing electronic drums and piano for texture. He also layered guitar and bass lines that Rabinowitz’s friends had recorded, and his own drums.
“I wanted to go for a Beatles sound, like a Ringo vibe,” Pollard said. “I didn’t use many drum mics, like a minimal miking technique and a ribbon mic, which will go for a darker sound on the overheads. I was surprised because it was my first time recording drums on my own, so I was happy with how they sounded.”
Despite support from his inner circle, Rabinowitz still struggled with opening up in his songwriting and jumpstarting his solo career.
“At first, I thought it was going to be freeing to finally have something out there and to really put that stamp on [the fact] that I’m a solo artist as well,” Rabinowitz said. “Instead, I’m still just mega scared because I want everyone to like it, and I want everyone to connect with it.”
Rabinowitz’s upcoming album “What Are We Living For?” features 12 original songs, including “2688 Miles.” The title draws inspiration from something a therapist once quoted to him: “You work to live, but what do you live for?”
“I work so hard on my music, but there’s been so many different avenues lately,” Rabinowitz said. “What do I want to do with my career? I call music my passion, but what am I trying to do within it?”
“2688 Miles” is only the beginning for Rabinowitz. He’s already hard at work on the rest of the album, which features even more student talent.
“The team that helped me out with it is filled with amazingly talented people,” Rabinowitz said. “It’s my version of perfect.”

Sunday marks the 95th Academy Awards ceremony. In preparation for the event, a team of eight staffers at the Daily Trojan have made predictions for the following six categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Original Screenplay, Best Adapted Screenplay.
For Best Picture, the team was split between five movies: “Triangle of Sadness,” “Tár,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and “The Banshees of Inisherin.” Here are the arguments for each. 
Kimberly Aguirre
Arts & Entertainment Editor
“Triangle of Sadness”
“Triangle of Sadness” is certainly not a favorite to win — Variety ranks it as second-least likely to take home the prize. The odds are even more against it when taking into account its Palme d’Or win — a great feat but bad sign when considering only two winners of the grand Cannes prize have gone on to achieve Best Picture glory. 
Still, the biting Swedish satire is deserving of the nomination and the award. There is intention behind every shot; each scene takes the film to an entirely new level. The movie leaves an impression, never scared to push the boundaries further. “Triangle of Sadness” has everything a Best Picture film should; it has the perfect cast, sharp writing, gorgeous cinematography and seasick-inducing levels of projectile vomit. 
An unlikely winner, “Triangle of Sadness” should not be written off just yet. If “The White Lotus” proves anything, it’s that out-of-touch rich people fighting is award-worthy content. Also, if the Academy wants to feign an image of class consciousness, this is the choice to make.

“Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Where “Top Gun: Maverick” was the lungs of the 2022 box office, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” was its heart. An underdog that was powerful from the start, “EEAAO” embodies all of the qualities of a film that truly deserves the Oscar. 
Unleashed into theaters last March, a release date that is typically out-of-bounds for awards consideration, and considering the unorthodox nature of the film overall, “EEAAO” is an unlikely Oscar darling. But the longevity of its awards campaign — driven passionately by film lovers and industry folk alike — is a testament to the film’s exceptional power that has shot it to the finish line. And now, looking back at its numerous wins throughout awards season, it is indisputable that “EEAAO” is the Best Picture frontrunner.
“EEAAO” is unparalleled in its originality, never trying to be anything but itself. Though maximalist in its filmmaking, it boils down to a simple tale about family, time and the “American Dream.” Perhaps the fates aligned to make the film the miracle it was, from Michelle Yeoh’s career-best performance alongside a powerhouse ensemble, to a timely immigrant tale that stands for the representation Hollywood needs. A win for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” would be a win for everyone.

“Top Gun: Maverick” 
The iconic film “Top Gun” (1986) left a lasting mark on generations. It revived its dominant position in pop culture through the sequel “Top Gun: Maverick.” It was filled with breathtaking stunts and heartbreaking nostalgia for an action-packed two hours. Whether or not you even watched either installment, “Top Gun: Maverick” made its way into mainstream media and was a cultural phenomenon during the summer of 2022. 
“Top Gun: Maverick” will win Best Picture for its meteoric rise and ability to fill the shoes of the original “Top Gun.” The immediate adoration of Miles Teller as Rooster combined with the sentimentality of Tom Cruise’s reprisal of his iconic character, Maverick, make this movie an unbeatable work.

“The Banshees of Inisherin”
On a fictitious island nestled behind the craggy cliff sides of Ireland, Martin McDonagh’s dark tragicomedy, “The Banshees of Inisherin,” steals the audience’s breath away. An unlikely favorite on paper, with its heart-wrenching portrayal of a seemingly uncomplicated platonic breakup and a sharply funny tone that never quite decides how seriously to take this premise, the Los Angeles Times predicts “Banshees” will come out swinging at the upcoming Oscars. 
The Irish Civil War rages behind a magnificently cast Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, and their decades-long friendship disintegrates as Colm Doherty (Gleeson) decides he doesn’t want the dull simplicity that Pádraic Súilleabháin’s (Farrell) company provides, preferring to spend his remaining time composing music that will outlast him. This conundrum is so painfully universal, as dumper or dumpee, leaving critics, members of the industry and moviegoers alike finding parts of themselves in the desolate farms and rolling fields of Inisherin.
With a boost from the BAFTAS and Kerry Condon’s gorgeous performance as Pádraic’s sensible sister who yearns afor more than her island can provide her, “Banshees” is definitely right up there with “EEAAO” and “Tár” as a Best Picture frontrunner.
