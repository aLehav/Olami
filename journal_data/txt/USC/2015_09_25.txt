Ben Pila never dreamed that he might one day play classical guitar for the Pope — but that is exactly what he will be doing. Pope Francis’ first visit to the U.S. will have him in New York on Friday to meet the families of several 9/11 victims, and Pila, a Thornton alumnus, will be there, playing what he described as “ambient music.”
“It’s super humbling, and I’m very honored to be there,” Pila, who earned his doctorate in musicial arts in 2011 said. “I think it’ll be a very spiritual event. I’m not a very religious person, but I feel like being at something like that is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and has the potential to be life-changing.”
Most classical musicians remember learning musical scales and cutting their teeth on “Greensleeves” and “Für Elise.” Pila, however, recalls his guitar education starting a bit differently.
“I started playing guitar when I was 12 because I was obsessed with Metallica and Ozzy Osbourne,” Pila said.
At the time, he said he never imagined that he’d end up playing classical guitar. Even at his performing arts high school, Pila said he tried to avoid the genre.
Pila’s invitation to play at the National September 11 Memorial comes after spending six years — from 2007 to 2013 — playing at the annual 9/11 memorial ceremony, an opportunity he first got when he was still a graduate student at Juilliard. For Pila, these performances have been the most impactful in his long career, mainly because of the context in which he’s playing.
“What impacted me the most was … being able to look out and see all of these people who are holding up pictures of their lost loved ones,” Pila said. “By playing music that is beautiful and peaceful, I like to think that I brought a little bit of comfort to them during that terrible day, when they have to think about what happened so many years ago.”
Throughout Pila’s years playing at the annual memorial ceremony, he has brushed shoulders with everyone from politicians to fellow musicians. He recalls listening to psalms read by presidents Barack Obama and George Bush, encountering Michael Bloomberg in the musicians’ tent and having a three-minute conversation with Yo-Yo Ma about how musicians can maintain strong fingernails. These experiences, far from creating a sense of self-importance, have only served to accentuate Pila’s down-to-earth attitude — he calls playing for the Pope a “gig” and jokes about how his guitar instructor at USC named his book after a bodybuilding film.
“[Professor] Scott Tennant wrote the technique book for classical guitarists,” Pila said. “It was called ‘Pumping Nylon,’ which is kind of a humorous title because it’s like weight lifting but for guitar.”
Tennant, who taught many of Pila’s guitar classes as well as his one-on-one lessons, describes Pila in much of the same way, as a student motivated by a desire to share his music with others rather than a desire to boast about his success.
“A moment that stood out to me was when he kind of nonchalantly told me that he would be playing for the 9/11 ceremony in New York,” Tennant recalled. “When he said, ‘By the way, I’m going to be playing with Yo-Yo Ma’ — that was a very important moment.”
Pila came to USC to earn his D.M.A. after receiving his Master of Music degree, specializing in guitar performance, from Juilliard. Before that, he studied guitar as an undergraduate at Florida State University. At USC, Pila encountered professors who he felt helped shape his career today.
“The teachers here have careers of their own that are pretty astounding,” Pila said. “Being able to learn from people that really have a hands-on outlook of the music industry, people that actually are performing artists, who have Grammys, who go out and tour the world […] is very beneficial to building a career.”
Pila’s career has certainly been prolific. He is the only classical guitarist ever to be named a Presidential Scholar in the Arts, and his music has been featured on The Today Show on NBC as well as NPR’s From the Top. He has won numerous prizes and today teaches guitar at Polk State College in Tampa, Florida. But, despite his litany of successes, Pila’s focus for the future isn’t necessarily to achieve fame and excellence.
“I just want to have a steady teaching gig, and I would like to perform as many concerts as possible,” Pila said before mentioning he will be performing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in April. For him, the performance isn’t about the prestige of the location or the audience. Instead, it’s all about the music because despite his long career playing classical guitar, he can still clearly remember being a 12-year-old kid obsessed with hard rock.
“When I’m in really good guitar shape, there’s nothing better than playing a really good classical guitar repertoire,” Pila said. “But [playing pop songs] brings me full circle, back to my roots of playing Metallica and Ozzy.”
Indeed, his version of Metallica’s “The Unforgiven” is up on his website, right next to Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” which he’ll be playing for Pope Francis. It’s a combination that only Pila could pull off — and, whether he’s playing for rock or religion, one that he makes uniquely his own.

Duo Rae Sremmurd and artist Ty Dolla Sign performing with high energy on stage. Caroline Feda | Daily Trojan
LOS ANGELES – Putting the ‘fun’ in Sunday Funday, on Sept. 20, Diplo, guest performers, and a stellar lineup of opening acts entertained a crowd of over 5,000 people at Mad Decent Block Party. The show is part of a series of 22 concerts in 19 cities ranging from Brooklyn to Toronto to LA hosted by Diplo’s record label, Mad Decent. 
What began in 2008 as an intimate block party in Philadelphia to generate buzz for signed artists and their friends has become a full-scale dance, electronic tour. This is no surprise considering the roster now includes well-known names such as Flosstradamus and Major Lazer. As a larger event the set up is fairly consistent from city to city with a large main stage, local food trucks and a beer garden. 
After being blown away by the block party in Brooklyn this August, I jumped at the chance to go again in downtown Los Angeles. I was even more excited to learn that the venue was a quick Uber ride away at Los Angeles Center Studios on West Fifth Street. It was essentially an expansive parking lot that funnelled into a narrow, yet deep rectangle. The lack of width, unfortunately, did not leave much room for concertgoers to get up close to the stage. It also prevented them from having the freedom to grab food or water and easily return to their friends. 
Though the space was a major drawback, the music easily distracted me from the discomfort. I was able to catch the second half of Cashmere Cat’s set and, as per usual, the Norwegian artist did not disappoint. True to his genre-bending remixes he added futuristic and mellow beats under the vocals of Ariana Grande for their hit song, “Adore.” He also played fan favorite Mirror Maru mixed in with dancier beats to feed the concert vibes.
Thomas Jack followed with an equally groovy set filled with his signature “tropical house” remixes. His hit, “Rivers,” had the crowd instantly dancing to the folksy vocals and electronic beat. Also featured under this musical subgenre was Klingande who brought out a live saxophonist. The instrument added another dimension to songs like Jubel and RIVA. He also served as hype man, running across the stage with a gopro attached to his saxophone. 
And then came Cut Copy. Though their darker indie beats have always been a bit intense for my musical taste, the group put on a fantastic performance. Founder, DJ Dan Whitford’s vocals were raw and intense, paired with the a perfectly choreographed light show. As stunning visuals flashed in time with songs such as “Lights & Music,” “Free Your Mind” and “Hearts on Fire,” it was impossible to turn away. He was joined onstage by band members Tim Hooey, Mitchell Scott and Ben Browning. A breath of fresh air from the deafening bass of deep house, the instrumental skill showed by Cut Copy was incredibly refreshing. 
That being said, I admit that I spent a lot of time during the set fantasizing about the “friends” Diplo had promised to bring out. The headliner and host emerged from behind his massive, elevated booth and bass vibrated across the pavement. To the excitement Diplo featured a lot of strong female vocals such as CL, George Maple and Aluna of AlunaGeorge. My personal favorite was Aluna. Her energy was infectious as she ran across the stage belting out hits like JackU’s hit “To U.”
After six hours of dancing and standing in the blazing heat the crowd still managed to join in the party when Diplo brought out Ty Dolla $ign and Rae Sremmurd. They played their popular collaboration “Blase” as white confetti and streamers fell over the crowd. After a few songs they were also joined onstage by the rest of their entourage for a massive dance party.
Despite the venue’s poor setup, energy was high among concert goers and performers. The eclectic lineup made the transition from chill sunday vibes to a hype rap concert. Mad Decent Block Party once again proved Diplo’s prominence and influence in the industry. 
Through collaborations, he is able to introduce new artists and give them a platform to spread their music to a larger audience. A truly honorable mission for a simple block party.
