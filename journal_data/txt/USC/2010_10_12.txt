With the House of Representatives effectively stalling the Child Nutrition Act a few weeks ago, the controversy over government involvement in children’s eating habits has returned to center stage.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The bill, officially titled the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, unanimously passed through the Senate in August,  but the version presented to the House had a major difference — a portion of the $4.5 billion used to improve the nutrition of school-provided meals would come from $2 billion in cuts to the federal programs that pay for food stamps.
Although initially supported by Democrats in Congress, this amended version was met with criticism from the party.
“It’s just plain wrong … the way you are going to pay for a child nutrition bill is by dipping into people’s food stamps? Give me a break,” said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) in an interview with The Huffington Post.
McGovern, who has advocated for child nutrition bills in the past, is not alone — many Democratic representatives have voiced similar opinions about the bill.
Their argument, of course, is that it is wrong to take away food stamps from recipients, especially in the present economic conditions. Realizing that this bill could easily lead to a drop in popularity among voters, Democratic leaders decided to postpone a vote on the bill after the upcoming midterm elections — which are crucial for democrats.
Anti-hunger groups and 106 Democratic Representatives even wrote a letter to House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to express their disapproval of the bill, according to The Washington Post.
If passed, the bill would authorize the government to spend $4.5 billion on school meals over 10 years — the first increase since 1973. The bill would also improve school nutrition standards — a major tenet of First Lady Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign to combat child obesity. Obama has advocated strongly on behalf of the bill.
Democratic representatives made the right move in postponing the vote on this bill. Not only would it have been politically disastrous, but the idea of taking funding away from a group in dire need is neither fair nor morally sound. Still, that does not mean the idea of government oversight in school nutrition is wrong. 
Though the bill has been tabled, the controversy over how much jurisdiction should be allowed in school nutrition is more heated than ever.
Critics claim the government is overstepping its bounds by telling young students what they can and cannot eat — a job that many feel belongs to parents, not legislators.
Therefore, any legislation that deals with restricting certain foods in schools is dangerous, and many worry that this could be a gateway for further federal oversight that will involve not just food, but academic content as well.
Unhealthy eating in schools creates a pattern for students that can continue well into college and adulthood, and lead to more serious health issues later in life. If the government steps in to curtail unhealthy eating habits early on, it is more likely those affected will avoid obesity and heart complications as adults.
Despite what critics say about parents losing the freedom to feed their kids any type of food, it is of utmost importance that the government does all it can to help curb childhood obesity — even if that means extending its hand into the school system.
Many parents are unwilling or unable to help their children eat healthy, or perhaps lack the proper understanding of childhood nutrition to make the healthy choices. Some families living in lower-income neighborhoods have often said that grocery stores carrying fresh fruits and vegetables are too far away from their homes or maintain price tags that are too unrealistic. With government intervention in nutrition, children living in such areas would be able to eat at least one healthy meal a day.
Preventing the government from playing a role in school nutrition hurts efforts against childhood obesity, and the health of young students at large. Although the current bill needs to be funded through an alternative source, the content and intention of the bill is spot on.

Just for the record, Nancy Pelosi is not House Majority Leader (Steny Hoyer is). Pelosi is Speaker of the House.
Sorry, America. There is no Santa Claus. When gov’t gives something for free, it’s not really free.
Hey Angad — if the government stopped taxing the hell out of people and strangling business with regulation, then there would be more JOBS and more people could afford those expensive fresh fruits and vegetables. 
BONUS: The government wouldn’t have to play “mommy” to tell us what to eat! 
The sheer arrogance of a comment like this: “Many parents are unable or unwilling to help their children eat healthy” (by the way Angad it’s “healthfully” when used in that context) — anyway, the arrogance astounds me. “Many parents”? Really? I love the way he moves right to “low-income” families next, to clarify the elite arrogance that those dumb poor people really don’t understand that an all-Twinkie diet is bad! WE MUST HELP THEM.
This bill is the opposite of spot on. And even if it were the right thing, which it is not, we can’t afford it no matter WHERE the funding comes from. Our government is broke. The last thing we should be doing is throwing money at a problem that we have no business sticking our nose in.

The Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism has partnered with AOL’s online news source, Patch.com, as part of a new PatchU program, which unites the site with 13 journalism programs at universities across the nation.
Patch provides comprehensive hyperlocal news to cities that typically do not receive much media attention, said William Nance, vice president of developing business group at Patch Media.
“We’re committed to being a member of the community. That’s how we build business up,” he said.
The hyperlocal business model of reporting news in specific cities has helped Patch grow into a trusted news source for local issues in cities around the nation, Nance said.
Since it began reporting in three cities in New Jersey in February 2009, Patch has grown to cover the news in numerous cities across 16 states and Washington, D.C. Patch launched a site in its 100th community in August, and AOL announced plans to expand to more than 500 neighborhoods in 20 states by the end of the year.
To help reach out to a different kind of community, Patch began the PatchU program, where journalism students will work with Patch editors to report on local news in areas near their campuses.
“Over time we expect to expand to other universities,” Nance said. “It helps us become a part of the discussions around the future of journalism.”
Annenberg’s involvement with PatchU began when Marcia Parker, West Coast editorial director for Patch, collaborated with Sandy Tolan, an associate professor of journalism at Annenberg, after the two worked together on a state-wide investigative reporting project in March.
“We talked about how we could do something that was really local but also had depth,” Tolan said. “I originally thought of the idea of having all the reporting for one class be in one square mile of a city.”
Now a reality, Tolan’s “One Square Mile” launched this fall with eight students who cover one square mile of Westfield in Culver City.
“It’s not really like a class; I consider it more of an editor-reporter relationship. It’s almost run as workshops that try to replicate what it’s like in the newsroom,” Tolan said.
Students are responsible for hunting down stories about education, crime, entertainment and culture in the area, Tolan said. She and Parker edit the students’ stories before sending them to local Patch editors who cover Culver City.
“We’re inventing this [project] as we go — the spirit of invention and innovation is at the heart of this,” Tolan said. “We’re among a group of schools that are trying to help lead students into an uncertain world of multimedia journalism.”
School of Journalism Director Geneva Overholser said the partnership fits into a larger scope of collaborations between USC and other media organizations.
“This class creates interesting journalism at a time when journalism is reinventing itself,” she said. “One of the most promising aspects [of new journalism] is collaborations.”
Tolan agreed that this project is a way for Annenberg to help lead students into an uncertain world of multimedia journalism.
Because Patch feels the pressure of the changes and challenges in the field of journalism, it has enlisted the help of the universities through PatchU, Nance said.
“Annenberg is one of the top journalism programs in the U.S.,” he said. “We’ve got such a focus on good journalists; Patch wants to make sure they have good partnerships with good journalism programs.”
So far, there are no set plans for Annenberg to continue with the PatchU program after this semester, Overholser said. Patch hopes, however, that this partnership will continue to benefit both itself and Annenberg, Nance said.
“It helps [Patch] become a part of the discussions around the future of journalism [and] what content and economic models will work,” Nance said. “We want to be in a relationship where these conversations are occurring.”

California gubernatorial candidates Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman met face-to-face Tuesday night to discuss their plans for the economy, upcoming propositions and the role of the government in their third live debate
Hot button · Gordon Stables (left), director of debate at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, moderates a panel debate between former Sen. Kevin Murray and former press secretary Margarita Thompson. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
The USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a debate watch and panel, where former California State Sen. Kevin Murray and Margarita Thompson, former press secretary for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, discussed what they believed were weak points in the candidates’ platforms and what they saw as a lack of charisma in each.
“[Brown should] stay safe; no major booms, and hope that [Whitman] makes a mistake,” Murray said. “Show them who you are, show personality and show people they can have a connection with you.”
Thompson said the recent drama surrounding the candidates’ campaigns were examples of what attracted voters.
“The media has proven that negative campaigning works,” she said.
During the debate, former eBay CEO Whitman began by speaking about a vision for California.
“Today what I see is the California dream is broken. Not everyone gets the chance to live their life,” Whitman said. “I was very lucky. … I really lived the California dream. I don’t think my story would be possible in any other country in the world.”
Both Brown and Whitman reiterated the points they made in previous debates, such as Brown’s positions on pension plan reform and increasing funds to state education.
Whitman emphasized her plan to reduce the size of the state government and create jobs.
“We need to use technology to do more with less,” she said. “We need to shrink the size of government, we need to have fewer people working.”
When asked by debate host Tom Brokaw about the recent revelation that Whitman had employed an illegal immigrant for nine years, she responded with her intended course of action to enforce border control.
“We have to hold employers accountable for hiring only documented workers,” Whitman said. “We’ve got to secure the border, hold employers accountable, eliminate sanctuary cities.”
Brown, however, said he believed the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the federal government.
“We need a comprehensive immigration reform on the federal level,” Brown said. “These are real people, these are mothers, dads and kids, and they have this fear.”
Brokaw also addressed a taped phone conversation in which one of Brown’s campaign staffers referred to Whitman as a “whore.”
“Again, Ms. Whitman, I’m sorry it happened. It does not represent anything other than what happens in the campaign,” Brown said.
Whitman said, however, that the slur was more than just a comment.
“So Jerry, it’s not just me, it’s the people of California who deserve better than slurs or personal attacks,” she said.
Alex Villosuerte, a senior majoring in history who identified himself as a liberal, said both candidates focused on the negatives.
“There have been a lot of attacks, and it seems like it’s 60 percent attacks and 40 percent about things they’ll do,” Villosuerte said.
Peter Kim, a sophomore majoring in political science who identified himself  as a Republican, said he would vote for Brown because of his past experience.
“They are trying to solve a fundamental budget problem that only someone like Brown with the know-how will be able to tackle,” he said.

In preparation for President C.L. Max Nikias’ inauguration on Friday, USC staff, faculty and students are working together to plan events for more than 10,000 expected attendees, university staff said.
Take a seat · About 10,000 chairs from Classic Party Rentals blanket campus from Doheny Library to Bovard Auditorium in  preparation for President C.L. Max Nikias’ inauguration on Friday. The installation ceremony will begin at 10 a.m., followed by a picnic. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
Preparations for the inauguration began in March when the university announced that Nikias would serve as USC’s 11th president, said Jeff Olsen, managing director of academic events.
“We’ve only had 10 [inaugurations] before and that’s pretty rare for a university that is so old,” Olsen said. “[This is] a special experience.”
Three committees consisting of about 80 people from Facilities and Management Services, USC Transportation and many other departments are helping to oversee and plan the inauguration, Olsen said. In addition, about 400 people will be involved in facilitating the events Friday.
Staff set up about 10,000 chairs on campus earlier this week between Doheny Library and Bovard Auditorium, Olsen said.
An integral component of the event will be the approximately 200 hosts — including volunteers from Society 53, Trojan Knights, USC Helenes and various departments — that will be stationed around campus on Friday available to answer any questions that visitors or students might have, Olsen said.
“Really, people shouldn’t be able to go about more than 50 feet without bumping into another host,” he said. “[They will] provide a friendly face especially for people who have never been to campus before.”
Preparations for Friday are similar to the ways in which the campus prepares for commencement by cleaning up, replanting and working to keep everything neat around campus, Olsen said.
In the event that it rains, the inauguration will be held in the Galen Center.
“We have to prepare for anything,” Olsen said. “We’ve got it all planned.”
Department of Public Safety officers will be on campus Friday to ensure that fire lanes remain clear, but people are still encouraged to attend inauguration even without a reserved seat, Olsen said.
“We’re anticipating that more people will show up than we have seats for, but that’s great. That’s what we want,” he said. “There’s space for everyone.”
The university invited the entire Trojan Family — students, staff, parents, alumni and members of the community — to attend the inauguration, Olsen said.
“It’s that kind of event that students are going to want to look back [on] and say, ‘I was there when it happened,’” Olsen said.

While many students will be traveling home to spend Thanksgiving with their families, those who are remaining at USC for the weekend will have the opportunity to spend the holiday with President C.L. Max Nikias and the Trojan Family.
Nikias will host a Thanksgiving dinner at the president’s house in San Marino — free of charge — for any student staying on campus for the weekend. It will be the first of its kind hosted by a USC president.
A traditional Thanksgiving meal will be served along with several vegetarian options, and students will have the opportunity to meet Nikias and his family.
“My wife Niki and I, as well as our daughters Georgiana and Maria, will be welcoming the students and I’m sure we’ll have good conversations,” Nikias said. “I love students and I want to connect with them in every way that I can.”
Over the next few weeks, the Division of Student Affairs will determine which students will be staying on campus during the holiday weekend in order to send them invitations to the dinner.
Students will RSVP on a first-come, first-serve basis to the event, which will host up to 350 guests.
The dress code will be semi-formal, and those students who are attending will be bused to and from the president’s house.
According to Nikias, his wife originally had the idea to invite students over for the dinner.
“We want USC students to understand the warmth of Thanksgiving, and hosting them at my home with my own family seemed like a great way to do it,” Nikias said.
Nikias said he hopes that the dinner will give students the opportunity to enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving gathering even if they are not spending the holiday at home.
“Niki and I know that many students are not able to be with their families and friends at holidays, and we wanted to provide a way for them to still feel a sense of community,” Nikias said. “Our students come to USC from all over the world, and it’s wonderful to be able to share time with those who don’t have family close by.”
Charlie O’Connor, a freshman majoring in theatre, said that the dinner would be a welcome opportunity to spend the holiday with others.
“It’s nice of him to host this,” O’Connor said. “I wouldn’t want to be stuck here on my own if everyone else was gone. It gives people a chance to join together.”
In addition to providing students with a communal Thanksgiving dinner, the event will also serve to show international students a uniquely American holiday.
O’Connor, who is originally from London, said that the idea of Thanksgiving is completely foreign to him and an event like this would most likely help other international students learn about it.
“To me, Thanksgiving was always like that episode of Friends I could never relate to. I wouldn’t even know it was happening if I was in England,” O’Connor said. “The dinner will help people to get immersed in it because it’s a very American thing and a staple of American culture.”
Nikias believes that the Thanksgiving dinner will be helpful, especially to international students who are experiencing the holiday for the first time.
“Many of us have had the experience of being away from home when others are celebrating a national holiday,” Nikias said. “In particular, many of us are new to American culture and traditions. This is a great way to introduce Thanksgiving to those who’ve never celebrated the event.”
Cheuk Yi Lau, a senior majoring in communication, said the dinner would be a good chance to connect with the president.
“People who can’t go home can feel like USC is their second home at this dinner, and its a good opportunity to talk with the president of USC,” Lau said. “They’ll feel better about not going home for the holiday and students will feel more excited about this dinner.”
Correction: 10/13/10: The president’s is located in San Marino, not Pasadena as originally identified. This entry has been corrected to reflect the change. 
the house is in san marino!!! give us some cred!!
As the Mom of a former out of state student, who did not always make it home for Thanksgiving, I think this is a great idea.
What a wonderful idea. Kudos to President Nikias and his wife!

After becoming a hit television series on The CW, The Vampire Diaries has returned for a highly anticipated second season. Sure, the show has vampires, a witch and the newest addition of werewolves, but don’t consider it your typical Twilight-esque television series.
The show has young adults across the nation glued to their television screens, hesitant to blink in fear of missing a key part of the drama. Though the story of two handsome vampire brothers trying to maintain peace in a town even though they are both madly obsessed with the same girl is already intense, the music takes the feeling to a different level.
Bloody good · The soundtrack features songs from the show’s two seasons, includes tracks from Gorillaz and Smashing Pumpkins. - Photo courtesy of EMI Music 
Past music on the show has included songs from Silversun Pickups, Katy Perry, Vampire Weekend, The Fray, Metric and 3OH!3. The diversity of the tracks in each episode helps make the show unique, allowing it to reach a wide audience with different tastes in music. The Vampire Diaries: Original Television Soundtrack is a 16-track compilation of songs from the show’s first two seasons and includes songs by Bat for Lashes, Gorillaz and Placebo’s cover of Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God).”
The mix of trance-like melodies and upbeat electro-rock tunes fluidly represents the dark, complex themes of the show. After pressing play, the first track, “Stefan’s Theme” by composer Michael Suby, pulsates into a calming, orchestral instrumental. The syncopation creates an atmosphere that makes listeners feel as if they stepped through their television screens into the forest setting of the show.
“Bloodstream,” a remix by Stateless, continues with a solemn disposition, though drawn-out vocals and vivid lyrics such as, They can cut you open / And the silence surrounds you and You’ve gotten into my bloodstream.
The addition of a synthesized groove in “Bloodstream” is a pleasing surprise element to segue into Goldfrapp’s “We Radiate” and “Obsession” by 18-year-old Sky Ferreira.
Ferreira’s dance-worthy, power-driven pop song is a great contrast to the somberness of the rest of the album, however it still plays into the storyline of the show. One of the lines, Here’s my confession / Don’t want you to love me / I want to be your attention, shows thematic similarities to the story arcs of the show’s characters.
The core themes of lust, obsession and longing show up in the songs “Head Over Heels” by Digital Daggers, “Down” by Jason Walker and “All You Wanted” by Sounds Under Radio, featuring Alison Sudol. The heaviness of the topic is emphasized through the deep-toned chords of the piano, strings and guitars floating in the background to support the heartfelt lyrics about sorrow, desire and fear.
The iconic rock band Smashing Pumpkins even makes an appearance on the soundtrack with “The Fellowship.” Deviating from the band’s usual alternative rock sound, the song has a touch of techno, giving it a futuristic feel.
There could not have been a better closing song to the soundtrack than Michael Suby’s instrumental, “1864.” It is exceptionally theatrical and expressive in a way that could make someone feel as if they were in a horror movie, where the killer is expected to pop out of the shadows. It will provide listeners with a haunting afterthought, leaving both fans and non-fans, craving more.
For a show as dark and romantic as The Vampire Diaries, the soundtrack is a fitting compliment. The tracks are not the cliché organ pieces of older horror works, but rather a modern take on dark music. It captures the tone of the show and is a great way to enhance its viewing.

Douchebag, which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Festival, follows the story of two estranged brothers who embark on a road trip — a plot that sounds as thought it has promise, but ultimately falls flat.
Lost love · Douchebag focuses on two long-separated brothers, Sam and Tom (Andrew Dickler and Ben York Jones), as they reunite before Sam’s wedding and hit the road to try to find Tom’s fifth-grade crush. - Photo courtesy of Prodigy PR
Sam Nussbaum (Andrew Dickler) is reunited with his brother Tom (Ben York Jones) a few days before his marriage to his fiancée Steph (Marguerite Moreau), who insists that Tom be in attendance at their wedding. She takes it upon herself to pick Tom up and drive him to their house, where the two brothers — who haven’t spoken for two years — are now forced to confront each other and live together.
Starry-eyed Steph questions Tom about his love life and asks whether or not he has ever been in love. Tom admits to being in love with Mary Barger, a girl he hasn’t seen since they were both in the fifth grade.
Steph and Sam insist that he bring her as his date to their wedding. After finding her online and discovering that there are three women in California with the same name, the two brothers set off on a Southern California road trip in hope of finding Tom’s dream girl.
The film gives us a glimpse into the evolving relationship of these two awkward and very different brothers.
With a title like Douchebag one would hope for an over-the-top character that would make viewers’ blood boil and cause people to yell the film’s title at the screen, but that’s not the case here.
The brothers’ differing personalities only add to their dysfunctional relationships. The trip sheds light on their varying characteristics, exposing the audience to the obnoxious, bossy and arrogant Sam who humiliates his markedly sensitive brother and forces him to engage in activities he feels uncomfortable with. Tom is an artist whose work is frequently belittled by Sam, who condescendingly refers to his brother’s artwork as mere “doodles.”
In the end, neither character is extremely likeable, but they are not utterly detestable either. In fact, audience members don’t have strong emotions about the characters either way and remain indifferent about them throughout the film. Because audience members lack interest in the two characters, it is difficult to remain invested in the story. On the surface, the characters’ differences make for an interesting story and good material for dialogue, but the characters fail to capture this potential.
Not only are the characters uninteresting but their conversations are bland and carry on for too long. In one scene, there is a debate among Sam, Steph and Tom about whether figure skating is a sport or a dance contest. They spend what seems like a couple of minutes arguing about this — and no ones laughs in the process. The strange choice of topic might have been humorous if executed correctly, but in this case the dialogue sounds more like someone created it to fill up time.
This moment, like many others in the film, has potential to be funny but misses the mark. As is the case with some films, the title generates more laughter than the actual movie.
There are some moments in the film however, that invoke a nervous, unintentional laughter just as with its title. There is a scene where Sam and Tom arrive at the doorstep of the “wrong” Mary Barger, forcing Sam to ask her to give back the bouquet of flowers they gave her. Viewers cannot help but chuckle at this awkward situation, but the film lacks enough of these small moments.
The premise of trying to find a fifth-grade sweetheart, although outlandish, has potential. The idea of two brothers taking a road trip in search of a childhood crush could have made for some hilarious moments. But the film fails to deliver.
Although the film revolves around a road trip, it has no direction. One could argue that the film is more about the journey rather than the destination, but it leaves the audience asking, “What was the point?” The ending is disappointing and leaves the viewer wondering why they were forced to ride along on this pointless trip.
Although there are some amusing moments in the film, Douchebag fails to live up to its compelling and risqué title.  I suppose, then, the moral of the story is: Never judge a film by its movie title.

We all mimic the sights and sounds around us, whether by nature or ambition. Morgan Kibby, a Los Angeles native who has spent several years working and touring with M83’s Anthony Gonzalez, providing pop-inclined vocals and assisting on the keyboards, is no exception. After some considerable time away from public life, Kibby has returned under the name White Sea, with a new EP that is as schizophrenic and lazy as it is occasionally spellbinding.
Leaping from weak dream pop to Euro-trance throwbacks, This Frontier achieves consistency only in its compositions. The synths that Kibby presumably grew to know quite well since the recording of M83’s Saturdays = Youth are all here and for the most part unleash an interesting zoo of waves, ripping through some choruses like sharks’ teeth.

What’s missing is a sense of focus. Under the direction of Gonzalez, Kibby’s indisputably haunting pipes, comparable to those of Kate Bush, were put to fine use, evoking the lusty personal melodramas of the 1980s John Hughes era. Left to her own devices, she extends her talents unadvisedly beyond their means.
“Ladykiller,” the EP’s most stilted track, is the strongest instance of such admirable but nonetheless disappointing posturing. Although the keys are nice and dirty, complimenting the sampled screams and pants in a sufficiently sultry manner, Kibby tries too hard to render the work club friendly, with lyrics promising to find [her] trophy tonight, and lamenting her waiting for the grass to grow / waiting for the hustle and flow.
Kibby doesn’t find much else in “Mountaineer,” carrying the track with sustained vocals and fuzzier synths that conjure the same sounds pioneered by School of Seven Bells on Alpinisms. Even the main chorus, with its groping for “teen dreams,” feels more like a shallow nod to Beach House than an thoughtful statement.
It’s a shame that the substance of Kibby’s work here doesn’t match the impressive production. Even on “Oljato” — an ode to American folk chants and the EP’s most underwhelming and underdeveloped track — the resolution of every instrument and the coloring of every voice is worthy of any Brian Eno or Nico Muhly arrangement.
Thankfully, there is a bright spot on the EP in the first track, “Cannibal Love.” The song seems to have been recorded beneath liters of salt water; the Gothic choir samples, digital pipes and percussion, and Kibby’s densely layered, almost smothered vocals create something truly chilling. More than anything, the track feels like a relic from an age where death came at the end of a spear, resurrected now in digital shades.
The track exceeds the rest of the disc not only in its relaxing instrumentation, but also in its electronic take on the soundtracks of sea epics and their ancient, atmospheric echoes — also giving the name of Kibby’s project some weight. The repeated vocal and guitar samples, set against a backdrop of instruments typically found in a 19th century orchestra as opposed to a modern studio, works far better than it should.
This kind of experimentation has kept the genre alive and beating for the past decade. Though Kibby’s track is a lone gem among mediocrity, its creation shows that she has the talent to create stronger albums. If Kibby chooses to follow the emotional hurricane of this track farther down the road, White Sea could truly become a name to watch.
Sadly, the domination of the EP by more malnourished fare is an ill omen for the growth of Kibby’s new outfit. Whether her diverse but uninspired borrowing from other acts springs from nostalgia or irony — both unadvisable — it remains to be seen whether the winter electronic scene that she heralds is in for a stagnant tide or a more compelling squall.

Los Angeles might be well known for sun, surf and celebrities, but its literary history has a reputation for being dark, depressing and — in the case of Charles Bukowski — drunk.
Like other 20th century L.A.-based writers such as John Fante, Raymond Chandler and Joan Didion, Bukowski made his career writing tales of the city’s murky underbelly. Unlike other L.A. writers, however, Bukowski lived the hard-edged lifestyle of his characters, who drank away the days, worked dead-end jobs, gambled at the racetrack and mingled with other outcasts living on the fringes of society.
As the so-called “Poet Laureate of Skid Row,” Bukowski is an unlikely cult hero. But the wine-soaked womanizer and one-time mail sorter at a Downtown Los Angeles post office defied all literary and cultural conventions and become the voice for a disenchanted post-war generation by making fans out of book publishers and imprisoned felons alike.
Almost as unlikely as Bukowski’s own career is the location of a new exhibit chronicling the late author’s life and work. “Charles Bukowski: Poet on the Edge” opened last Saturday and runs through Feb. 14 at The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, which is known for its collection of 18th century French portraits and rare printed manuscripts.
A classical institution that showcases bronze Roman statues and Goya paintings, The Huntington is the least likely place to display the dusty typewriter and permanently stained wine glass that sat on Bukowski’s desk for the majority of his career. And yet, after winding through the main exhibition hall with the permanent collection (housing The Gutenberg Bible, letters written by Abraham Lincoln and John James Audubon’s folio Birds of America), a sign warns visitors that “this exhibit may contain strong language” before entering the exhibition.
“All I need now is what I needed then: a desk lamp, the typer, the bottle, the radio, classical music and this room on fire.”
The foyer of the exhibition is a museum version of Bukowski’s office. In a glass case lies everything from his desk; speakers to the side project his favorite classical music and framed broadsheets of his published poetry line the walls alongside some of the author’s more well-known quotes.
In the main room there are 10 glass cases, each with a chronological theme that sweeps visitors through Bukowski’s life from acne-riddled teen to voice-of-the-people with emphasis on his legacy and legion of devoted fans. From his childhood to his early writing to fame to his cinematic explorations, the exhibition contains more than 70 objects from Bukowski’s literary collection, which were donated by his widow, Linda Lee Bukowski, in 2006.
The Huntington displays some of Bukowski’s physical literary output, such as an original press of Ham on Rye and limited edition copies of L.A.-based literary journals he was published in, but more often museumgoers are treated to personal artifacts that give insight to the man behind the gruff exterior.
These never-before-seen papers and works provide Bukowski’s own perspective in an exhibit that might otherwise be overrun with his already-released cultural output. In the “Passions and Vices” case, for example, the compulsive gambler’s horse betting papers are displayed complete with his own hand-scrawled notes and strategies. Other cases featured letters to colleagues, edited poems and even a “Certificate of Poetic License” jokingly given to him by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg.
The exhibition walks between the personal and professional with ease, chronicling both Bukowski’s relationship with Black Sparrow Press, the independent publisher that offered him his first monthly stipend, allowing him to quit his job at the post office and write full time, and his large collection of fan mail, which in this instance included love letters and photographs of a woman’s bedroom.
At more sober points, the exhibit had all the markings of a Huntington-worthy academic display, but when Bukowski’s personality burst through the staid atmosphere, it became less like an exhibit of his work and more like an opportunity for visitors to rifle through his desk without permission.
For one of L.A.’s most iconic literary voices, it’s surprising that “Poet On The Edge” is the first comprehensive exhibit ever compiled of the late author’s work. It might seem odd to have an unconventional author such as Bukowski on display at an institution such as The Huntington, especially when the Los Angeles Public Library holds more personal significance to his growth as a writer, but thanks to his widow’s donation, Buk (as he was known by close friends) will now rest in the pantheon of publishing history alongside Geoffrey Chaucer, Henry David Thoreau and Jack London.

The team of more than 30 USC School of Architecture students that make up the USC Architecture Brigade are planning on making their second trip to Latin America for a charity construction project in January.
For two weeks, 16 of those students will take the group’s preparation and fly to Santa Rosa, Honduras to design a school and construct it “completely by hand,” according to senior architecture and business major Nathan Doctor, founder and president of the USC Architecture Brigade. The student-run group designs and constructs socially and environmentally sustainable infrastructure projects in Central America in collaboration with Global Architecture Brigades.

“I think at USC we have so many opportunities and a huge amount of resources,” Doctor said. “We should utilize them in a way that helps someone and makes a tangible difference in their life.”
There are about 35 students involved in the USC Architecture Brigades program in Honduras. It was no easy task; the students looked at several things unique to the area when creating their design, from building materials and techniques to culture and seismic activity.
The students have since consulted professors and will  finalize construction drawings before traveling to Honduras this January, spending two weeks to build the home — one week to finalize designs at the location and a second week devoted to construction.
“We get to go down there, meet the people and see the change we’re creating,” Doctor said.
Last February, the Architecture Brigade built a ranch home on an area occupied by subsistence farmers in Gatu, Panama. It was the first year the students formed a USC Global Brigade chapter.
“The fact that I can say that I helped design and build a real structure that is impacting people’s lives before I’ve graduated is pretty special,” said Bradley Sutton, a senior majoring in architecture and a member of the program.
In Gatu, people must travel to far away sugar cane plantations to chop cane for at least one month a year, leaving their families at home alone, Sutton said. The buildings that the students created will help provide more food storage and safety during times of financial uncertainty.
During the development process, the group made two trips to Panama. The first trip was a discovery visit to explore the site, its surroundings and talk with the people of the community to try to determine their needs and wants from the new farm building, Sutton said. The second trip was all business and breaking ground. The group worked from sunrise to sundown every day, building the structures.
The Brigades ultimately resulted in the construction of a building that allowed residents to dry and store crops for sale at market, enabling them to earn the necessary money and allowing them to stay with their families and farms year-round.
In Panama, the students lived with local families for two weeks, immersing themselves in Honduran culture.
“It’s rewarding to leave seeing a lasting sense of change, focusing on the root causes of the problems we see,” Doctor said.
For the students, it was a chance to get some real world experience.
“In architecture school, there is always a disconnect between the virtual world of design and the physical world of building,” Sutton said. “When you are actually building something with your own hands, you learn more than you would doing a thousand drawings or computer models.”
Clarification: A previous version of this story stated that the group would be building a house in Honduras.  In fact, the students will be helping to build a school in Honduras. This entry has been updated to reflect the change.

Let me start off by dispelling the notion that patience is a virtue when it comes to following sports.
In fact, I am convinced that whoever came up with that thought-provoking proverb never had to experience the agony of watching his team lose on gut-wrenching, last-second drives two weeks in a row.
A proven mind · Trojans defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin has instituted a variation of his famed Tampa-2 defense at USC, but the team’s recent struggles have some people questioning his decision. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
We live in a world of sports dominated by the phrase “What have you done for me lately?” It is a phrase that largely diminishes any redeeming value in rooting with a sense of calm and optimism, regardless of the outcome.
It’s the reason you likely pulled out some chunks of well-groomed hair, or, if you come from the more uncouth ilk of fanaticism, yelled your favorite four-letter obscenities when kickers Erik Folk and Nate Whitaker landed knockout blows to the Cardinal and Gold in painful succession these last two weeks.
Odds are, after the bitterness and shock of watching the ball sail effortlessly through the uprights subsided, curse words and sighs of “not again” quickly transformed into finger-pointing and overly emotional statuses on your favorite social networking websites.
And though I can’t blame you for your passion and enthusiasm, after perusing the endless amounts of online outrage, it appears your index finger needs some redirection.
When news broke in January that defensive guru Monte Kiffin would be Tennessee two-stepping his way out of Knoxville and heading where the grass really is greener, the buzz around Los Angeles was actually more noticeable than when the original announcement came down that his son, Lane, was actually the one leading the charge from the Volunteer State to the gates of Troy.
Here was a guy with almost 45 years of coaching experience, a Super Bowl pedigree not typically found in Division I football and a defensive method that went from unconventional methodology to a strategic staple in professional and collegiate locker rooms across the country before you could even spell out T-A-M-P-A-2.
It was simple: If the man with the actual blueprints was coming to USC, then the Trojans’ illustrious defense was surely back in business after a year of hibernation.
But somewhere between his first steps off the charter jet and the 69 points his defensive unit surrendered to Washington and Stanford, the once-beloved elder Kiffin has fallen out of favor with fans faster than Al Pacino did in the first 20 minutes of The Godfather Part III.
Sanctions or no sanctions, success isn’t just expected from the disillusioned play-callers from the stands; it’s demanded.
If you are directing your siege of cynicism in the 70-year-old coordinator’s direction, however, I’d like to politely caution you.
Frankly, as individuals that see the game on the less important side of the white lines, we only really know the Tampa-2 on a surface level.
We’ve heard of its historical significance, the trophies it helped win and even the players it pushed onto the map of notoriety.
But what often gets blurred, from the field to the land of lunacy we call fanhood, are the complexities that lie beneath the successes.
At its core, the Tampa-2 is a bend-but-don’t-break philosophy that relies more on the sum of its parts than on any one or two individuals.
It favors speed and range over the traditional size and strength. Prevention and subtle opportunism trump physicality and traditionalism.
Most importantly, your personnel is your personnel. Monte Kiffin’s innovative plan of attack relies on the ability of its participants to take on roles they ordinarily wouldn’t play in, say, a 4-3 or 3-4 scheme.
Outside linebackers are typically asked to drop back in the secondary; safeties are encouraged to blitz often; cornerbacks don’t need to be proficient at coverage skills but rather top-notch tacklers, and your anchor and most dynamic player is the middle linebacker, who captains the unit by combining his above-average speed with a knack for reading the opposing quarterback.
If this sounds like a match made in heaven for USC’s starting sophomore middle linebacker Devon Kennard, senior cornerback Shareece Wright and freshman Nickell Robey, and sophomore safeties T.J. McDonald and Jawanza Starling — who came into the year with a combined three starts — please re-evaluate your expectations immediately.
This team — and more directly this beleaguered unit — was bound to hit several bumps in the road this season.
Washington quarterback Jake Locker’s improbable 18-yard jump pass to receiver De’Andre Goodwin on fourth and long, Washington running back Chris Polk’s 26-yard scamper up the gut and Stanford running back Stepfan Taylor’s you’ve-got-to-be-kidding-me 16-yard stroll toward impending victory are the indelible moments that continue to open up water cooler debates as to whether or not Monte Kiffin still has the magic touch.
But to even fuel such fodder about a man and his renowned creation, whose rèsumès respectively speak for themselves, is foolish to say the least.
It’s an uncomfortable sight to watch opposing fans and players storm the field moments after watching your peers lay victim to another heartbreaking defeat.
And with a tradition that preaches immediacy and lofty goals regardless of surrounding circumstances, I understand the frustration and prevailing groans that continue to echo from Palo Alto to this melancholy campus in the aftermath of the most recent one that got away.
Yet, it is crucial not to neglect the writing that has remained on the wall since before the season even began — words that spoke to inexperience, change and patience as the Trojans and their program made a hasty about-face in the wake of untimely departures and NCAA backlash.
The sample size for USC’s defense this season is by no means aesthetically pleasing — 26 points per game, 428.7 yards of total offense per game, countless missed tackles, misguided penalties and two losses that more or less resulted from the inability to make crucial stops.
Nonetheless, call on some history of Monte Kiffin’s most recognized stomping ground and you’ll find similar alarming numbers at first glance.
In 1996, during his first year in Tampa Bay, the Nebraska native’s defensive unit was almost as hideous as its Orange Crush jerseys. The Buccaneers — who finished fourth in the NFC Central — began the year 1-8, behind a Warren Sapp-, Donnie Abraham- and John Lynch-led defense that allowed more than 20.6 points per game in those losses and suffered forgettable, lopsided routs to the tune of 34-3 and 27-0.
The following year, however, Kiffin’s defense lead the NFC in fewest points allowed, fewest yards allowed and total offense allowed, en route to the franchise’s first playoff appearance in 15 years.
During the rest of his 11-year tenure in the Sunshine State, the Tampa-2-led Buccaneers never finished  below the top 10 in total team defense.
Although I cannot assure you that such a turnaround will happen at nearly the same rate here, there is a reason why his playbook has rarely been tampered with, despite being passed down from eager coaches near and far: It works.
Time is of the essence. You have a four-year window to experience the winning culture firsthand, and then the door violently closes, forcing you to vicariously live through it from afar.
Despite the overarching tendency to view growth week to week only as it is defined on an LCD scoreboard, I advise, when looking at where Monte Kiffin and this defense are headed, to search beyond the box scores and stat sheets.
Look a little deeper, and I promise you will find that the proof really is in the pudding.

To call Lane “unqualified” despite his resume strips you of all credibilty. Who cares who Pat Haden would have hired. Any true football fan knows it takes more then a year to build a program. Maybe hold your tongue untill 2013, then you woud have a clear pix of where we are…right now you just sound ridiculous.
The only excuse for bringing an unqualified coach like Lane Kiffin to SC was the argument that his dad, Monte, was defensive genius.  The last two losses to Washington and Stanford, where those teams amassed 500+ yards, then launched last minute drives to negate all that the offense had done renders that argument totally false.    Sure the defense is young, but they showed no heart in letting the Huskies and Cards run over them.  Shame on Monte and Lane!
BTW…Are there any Torjan fans out there who really think that Pat Haden would have hired a coach who has done nothing to earn a position at one of the nation’s’ top programs?!

Even though USC is coming off last-second back-to-back losses, the Trojans are just trying to get past California this weekend and into the bye week without any more injuries.
Tripped up · Freshman tailback Dillon Baxter hyperextended the toes on his left foot during the fourth quarter against Stanford on Saturday. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
After playing a physical Cardinal defense and with another physical defense in Cal coming up, the Trojans will have had their depth tested.
Numerous key players were limited or sat out of practice Tuesday. Redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton, freshman tailback Dillon Baxter, senior linebacker Malcolm Smith and redshirt junior linebacker Shane Horton did not practice because of injuries.
“I looked out at seven-on-seven and in our second team’s defensive seven you might only know the names of two of them,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It is what it is. We got to find a way to get guys healthy.”
Kiffin said he hopes Baxter and Smith can both play Saturday, but Baxter isn’t so sure, as he spent Tuesday walking on crutches with a blue cast around his foot. Baxter, who scored his first touchdown early in the game last weekend, hyper-extended the toes on his left foot after running a Wildcat play in the fourth quarter.
Baxter said doctors initially didn’t know the extent of his injury; his foot was swollen after the game, and he said he planned to get it checked out after practice.
“I’m trying to get back this week. We’ll see. Hopefully I can,” Baxter said. “But this will be the only week I’ll be out. Bye weeks are so good, especially right now.”
Baxter, who said last week he wasn’t giving 100 percent effort earlier in the season, seemed to be a bigger factor in the offensive gameplan last week than in any of the Trojans’ first five games.
“I started getting more touches; we started working the Wildcat more,” Baxter said. “I finally got my first touchdown, and I was so jacked, and to be out the next game sucks.”
The injuries have also affected the defensive side of the ball, where multiple starters were limited. Kiffin said this has prevented the Trojans from trying to move people around and causing a spark.
“We’ve thought about it, but as you saw with the injury report, there’s a number of guys not here or limited, so we’re just trying to plug guys in,” he said.

Not only are the Trojans coming off back-to-back losses for the first time since 2001, they are also coming off back-to-back losses on the last play for the first time in history.
“We were talking today and USC’s played football over 100 years and there’s been four games in the last 100 years where USC’s lost on the last play of the game,” Kiffin said. “Four in 100 years and now we’ve done it twice in seven days. It’s a record we didn’t want to break or be a part of. It’s a lot of adversity for our guys to go through.”
Despite that, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said he was proud of the way the team came out in practice Tuesday.
“Well, I was really happy with the energy the guys brought out here,” Barkley said. “It’s really important we carry this through the week. Obviously the losses are really disappointing — we didn’t expect this. But it will show the character of our team and whether we can bounce back after these losses, and it’ll show who we are.”
With the poor play on defense, the Trojans are relying more on offense to win. Barkley said he doesn’t feel any added pressure from this and that Saturday was the most relaxed he has felt on the field during his time here.
“I had a great week of preparation in the classroom so when I got out on the field everything was just slow and it was real easy. I was seeing everything perfectly,” Barkley said. “Personally, I felt really comfortable out there.”
Barkley has played well since Kiffin singled him out in a team meeting after the Washington State game a few weeks ago, when Barkley threw two interceptions. The sophomore quarterback took it as an opportunity to grow.
“Regardless of what he was going to say, I knew something was coming or something needed to change because I knew with that play, once we got into a tougher schedule, it wasn’t going to fly,” Barkley said. “I took it personally and as a challenge to grow and become a better quarterback. I like the way he’s pushing me so far and I think I’ve grown better because of that.”

you sure ask alot of the coach in his first year. i see you are knowledgable (eye roll). See Carrols first year record…..does 6-6 ring a bell? why not wait three years to see where we really stand instead of sounding ignorant. 
Fight On!
Every team has injury problems at some point in the season. I get the feeling this is an excuse for the loses. Lane Kiffin has had more opportunities, riding daddy’s coat tails, than any coach in history. We are facing the heart of our schedule, with quality opponents, with a possibility of losing 5 of the next 7 games! What will Coach Kiffin say then? NO MORE EXCUSES! Excuses are for losers. Good recruiting and depth on a team is your hedge against injuries. I hope Pat Haden is watching very closely. I admire and respect our new AD. He has been around the NCAA, NFL and many sports organizations. I don’t know how long he’ll sit by and watch the Trojan meltdown. I hope he has alternate plans in the works. GO TROJANS! FIGHT ON!

The USC men’s golf team finished a strong fifth at the Jack Nicklaus Invitational in Columbus, Ohio, Tuesday, defying any doubts set by its first outing, the Ping/Golfweek Fall Preview.
Leaders of the pack · Sophomore T.J. Vogel (above) and freshman Jeffrey Kang led USC at the Jack Nicklaus Invitational as they both finished at 5-over-par 215. The Trojans finished in fifth place out of 10 teams in the two-day tournament in Columbus, Ohio. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Led by freshman Jeffery Kang and sophomore T.J. Vogel, the Trojans finished at 38-over-par 878 (287, 299, 292), landing them 14 strokes back from the winning Oklahoma State team on one of the toughest courses they will face all year.
Kang and Vogel tied for fourth in individual scoring, at 5-over-par 215.
Sophomore Martin Trainer said he was impressed by both teammates.
“[Vogel] is very good,” Trainer said. “This will be a typical finish for him, top 10 almost every tournament. [Kang] we all knew was really good, and very impressive in practice. He surprised us these past couple of days, and I’m glad to see it”
Kang had an impressive final round, shooting a 1-over-par 71 to elevate himself from seventh place.
He had a turbulent first nine holes, shooting two bogeys, one double bogey, a birdie and the team’s only eagle of the tournament. On the second nine, he hit for one bogey and one birdie.
On Monday, Kang had a solid first round, shooting for 3-over-par 73, with three birdies, four bogeys, and a double bogey. In the next round (which took place later Monday), Kang came back even stronger, hitting a 1-over-par 71 with three birdies, two bogeys and a double bogey.
On Tuesday, Vogel shot a 3-over-par 73, bumping him up from fifth place to fourth. He hit four bogeys and one birdie on the day.
On Monday, Vogel had a dominant first round, hitting a team low 2-under-par 68 with five birdies and three bogeys. In round two, Vogel hit for 4-over-par 74, with one birdie, three bogeys and a double bogey.
Third for the Trojans was Trainer, who finished tied for 26th with a 14-over-par 224.
Trainer overcame a tough first day to hit a stellar 2-over-par 72, elevating himself 10 places. On Monday, Trainer shot a 4-over-par 74 and an 8-over-par 78, and sat in 36th place.
Sophomore Stewart Hagestad hit a 6-over-par 76, with five bogeys, one double bogey and a birdie. This left him in 35th place, following a tough first day where he shot a 4-over-par 74 and a 7-over-par 77.
Rounding out the Trojan squad was junior Steve Lim, who hit a 10-over-par 80 to finish tied for 39th.
On Monday, Lim had a mediocre second round (7-over-par 77) following a strong first round where he hit for 2-over-par 72. Lim missed the last tournament because of a family conflict.
These results are a complete turnaround from the Trojan’s last outing, the Ping/Golfweek Fall Preview. The Trojans finished their first tournament with a disappointing last-place finish in a field of 15, hitting 84 strokes over par.
The progress reminds Trainer of last season, and he remains optimistic.
“Last year we were weak at the start of the year, and by the end we were one of the strongest teams out there,” Trainer said. “Hopefully this rate of improvement keeps up. We hung in there and did well. ”
The Trojan’s next outing is against Georgia Tech at the The Golf Club of Georgia on Oct. 24-26.

Lost amid the increasingly acrimonious campaign for governor has been a pleasant surprise in this year’s state elections — the relative silence that has surrounded the propositions.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The race between Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman is becoming about as dirty as politics can get. Two recent examples include an ad that shows Whitman’s nose growing like Pinocchio’s to dramatize allegations of lies in her campaign, and the recently leaked comments by someone within the Brown campaign calling Whitman a whore.
The campaigns for and against the propositions on this year’s ballot have been a welcome contrast. The most controversial proposition, Proposition 19, which would legalize the possession and use of marijuana under state law, has yet to generate the kind of loud, aggressive debate that one might have predicted a few months ago.
The benefits of this lack of hostility — beside the airwaves not being flooded with annoying advertisements — can be demonstrated via a comparison with Proposition 8 of 2008, which outlawed same-sex marriage in California.
As anyone who was in the state at the time will remember, Proposition 8 was the subject of an intense campaign in which both sides were increasingly hostile toward the other.
Because of the nature of the campaign, those on the losing side felt slighted when the proposition passed because they were not only morally outraged — and in the case of the gay community, deprived of the right to marry — but also felt the result of the referendum was determined more by politics than the opinion of most Californians.
After the election, many analysts pointed to the success of religious groups that opposed Proposition 8 and the unusually high turnout of African-American voters caused by President Barack Obama’s candidacy as one factor leading to the passage of the proposition.
The vast sums of money that groups such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints spent to advertise on behalf of Proposition 8 in ways that could easily be perceived as unfair — such as the campaign that linked same-sex marriage to elementary school curriculum — were also instrumental in the proposition’s success.
When this type of political campaign ends, whether it is over a referendum or a candidate for office, because the losing side inevitably feels cheated, the issue continues to linger long after the election. Proposition 8, which was overturned by the California Supreme Court earlier this year, is again a prime example.
By contrast, elections that are free of this style of campaigning tend to be perceived by the public as much fairer. Therefore their outcomes are more highly respected. That is likely to be true of this year’s referenda.
The Californian government should learn this lesson and apply it to policy by banning smear campaigning and putting severe limits on fundraising related to propositions.
Opponents of this type of reform would likely argue that publicity is irreplaceable in making voters aware of the consequences of their ballots. However, California already does an efficient job of educating the public about its choices even in the absence of expensive, complicated or demeaning campaigns from either side.
Registered voters receive an election guide in the mail that provides neat and fair summaries of each bill, as well as the full text of each, and the official campaigns for either side are given a small space in which to make their arguments. Leafing through this pamphlet is usually enough to allow voters to make informed decisions.
In contrast, allowing fundraising to be a major factor in campaigns gives too much power to special interests that can afford to flood television and radio airwaves with advertisements. Smear campaigning often distorts the issue and misinforms the public, skewing election results and creating a disaffected losing side.
Some might argue that the government should go even further and impose similar restrictions on campaigns for official positions.
This, however, would be going too far, because it would give incumbent candidates an unfair advantage, and leave too much room for subjective decisions about what constitutes a smear. Furthermore, such restrictions would have no chance of being passed in Sacramento because of how unpopular they would be with most politicians.
Still, that is no reason not to take sensible action to keep our referendum campaigns as clean and fair as this year’s have been in the future. Doing so would mean that results would mostly reflect the majority’s opinion and the minority would have more reasons to respect electoral outcomes.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Wednesdays.
Daniel suffers from LDD — logic deficiency disorder. 
He says California should ban smear campaigning (for propositions), but we can’t ban smear campaigning for elected officials, because it would leave too much room for subjective decisions about what constitutes a smear. 
So, Daniel, who gets to decide what constitutes a smear for propositions? 
Your implication that Prop 8 campaigning was a “smear” (because it linked same-sex marriage to a elementary school curriculum) is very weak, as this was indeed a legitimate point (borne out by the constant reports of controversy in school districts over what to say about homosexuality). 
As opposed to a real smear — for instance, like calling a woman candidate a whore. Now THAT’S a smear.

President Barack Obama said Monday that the country needs a “roads, railways and runways” program to fix the nation’s infrastructure, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The program would cost $50 billion, but Obama said the project would provide much-needed construction jobs for the American economy.
In a report issued, the administration said half of new jobs will be in construction.
The Senate, however, will not be discussing the bill any time soon, according to Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
“Because the November lame-duck session is all booked up, the very earliest the Senate could consider the president’s proposal now would be December,” he said.

Tonight’s hour-long debate between Democratic candidate  Jerry Brown and Republican candidate Meg Whitman will start at 6:30 p.m.  and take place at Angelico Hall on the campus of Dominican University in San Rafael, with Tom Brokaw serving as moderator.
6:31 p.m. Tom Brokaw is welcoming viewers to the third and final gubernatorial debate, calling it a “crucial election at a crucial time.”
6:32 p.m. Brokaw is asking each candidate to directly address Californians and say what they can do for the state. Whitman has the first answer, and is explaining what drew her to the state is the hope it had. She acknowledges that she was lucky enough to run a major Internet company and “live the California Dream.” This dream, she says, is now broken.
“Everyone’s going to have to make a sacrifice to get California back on track,” Whitman says, adding that it can be done.
Brown now has the floor, telling Californians that tough decisions will have to be made, but we can’t point the finger and scapegoat. “We’re going to have to rise above the poisonous partisanship,” he says. “We really have to think for the first time as Californians.”
6:36 p.m. The budget is now the topic. Brokaw is asking Whitman if she thinks Californian voters are being realistic in their views of the budget crisis the state faces.
Whitman says Californians have the right instinct, but goes back to one of main talking points, saying the way to improve the economy is to create jobs. The government must be shrunk — “There must be less people working,” she says, before quickly correcting herself. “There must be less people working in government.” — pension must be removed, and welfare must be shrunk.
Now there’s a Bay Bridge example that Whitman is using, talking about how the construction of the bridge was over budget.
6:38 p.m. Now Brown is responding, saying there are limits that we might recognize. He’s saying that given the state’s budget history, the budget process should begin earlier. If elected, he says he will start the budget process not in January, but in November. He’s travel throughout Northern California and then Southern California to put the budget together, he says.
“We can return power to the local level,” Brown says. “Those at the top should cut first. Lead by example.” If elected, he’ll cut the governor’s office, he says.
6:40 p.m. Now Brokaw is asking Whitman about Proposition 13, which she says is essential to the future of California. The only way to increase tax revenue, she says, is to increase jobs — again returning to her talking points. Competition is also important, she says, and taxes must be beneficial to big business to keep them based in California.
“It’s not OK that many big companies are leaving California for other states,” she says.
Now Brown has the floor, saying that he made the proposition work with a $5 billion surplus when he was governor. He speaks about eliminating the capital gains tax, which he says Whitman would do if elected but he wouldn’t. Doing so, he says, would take away money from public schools, “and that just isn’t right.”
“Jerry Brown’s just wrong about this,” Whitman says, saying it’s a tax on jobs and job creators. Eliminating the capital gains tax would create more jobs and make the state more competitive.
Brown delivers a zinger, asking Whitman how much money she would save on the tax breaks. The crowd stirs.
“I was a job creator,” Whitman replies.
6:46 p.m. After some back and forth between the candidates, Brokaw tries to regain control of the debate, but is interrupted by Whitman, who says Brown just delivered a classic politician half-answer. She says that the unemployment rate rose under his previous leadership as governor.
After Whitman is done talking, Brokaw doesn’t stand a chance. Brown has jumped in to reply, saying that it was during a recession but jobs were in fact created.
6:48 p.m. Brokaw is able to get a word in again, asking Brown about the budget again and saying that Brown’s plan is too similar to the one the state just endured in passing its late budget.
“That’s a great question,” Brown replies, saying that he has experience creating budgets — he’s overseen eight of them. He goes back to a point he made earlier, saying the budget process needs to begin earlier than January, with legislators and then special interest groups. He also wants to take it on the road and ask people, “What is California government?” to better create a conversation about the state’s needs, he says.
He’s going back to talking about making cuts at the top, taking 10 to 15 percent from the governor’s office and then moving on to the legislation.
6:50 p.m. Whitman is talking about Brown’s idea that the “process is the plan,” and is calling Brown out on his plan to cut the governor’s budget, saying it will not make much of a difference in the overall budget crisis the state faces. Brown interrupts, but doesn’t get far, and the audience claps.
Whitman is pitching herself as a Sacramento outsider, saying her experience in Silicon Valley will bring a fresh approach to problem solving.
6:52 p.m. Brokaw tries to ask another question, but Brown responds.
Brokaw now is asking about the “100,000-pound gorilla in the room:” pension programs and whether or not current pensioners should be required to cut back.
According to Brown, compromise is needed in pension reform.
Whitman says we can’t touch existing pensioners can’t have their money taken away since they agreed to it, but has turned the focus on Brown, saying his philosophy is “do as I say, not as I do,” saying the only city manager in the state that was paid more than the Bell city manager was Brown’s city manager in Oakland. The benefits are too padded, she says, and it’s squeezing money from other areas that need it. “The rank-and-file deal has to be entirely different,” she says, but saying that those serving in law enforcement roles should remain protected.
6:57 p.m. Brokaw now asks if there should be a state law overseeing the pension programs of cities and municipalities.
Whitman responds, saying this is where the government needs to step in. “What the governor negotiates with the unions sets the tone,” for the state, she says. Now she returns to another talking point — Brown is beholden to the labor unions, she says.
“I am spending my own money in this race, but it gives me the independence in Sacaramento,” she says, adding that she’s only beholden to the voters of California.
Brown is now responding to some of Whitman’s earlier claims about his city manager in Oakland, saying that Whitman is distorting the facts. He also calls her out on her pension plan for law enforcement, saying their costs eat up a majority of the pension funds.
Whitman responds, saying that there would be modifications to the retirement age of law enforcement officials.
7 p.m. Now the real elephant in the room is brought up: the leak earlier this week that someone within the Brown campaign referred to Whitman as a “whore.”
“I don’t agree with that comparison, number one. Number two, this is a five-week-old convseration picked up,” Brown says, to some “oohs” from the audience. He apologizes to Whitman.
“So Jerry, it’s not just me, but the people of California who deserve better than slurs and attacks,” Whitman says. “You know better than that, Jerry. The fact that you are defending your campaign for a slur and a personal attack on me, I think it’s not befitting on California.”
“It’s a private conversation,” Brown responds, apologizing again and saying he questions the legality of using the conversation. He tries to draw the conversation back to pension reform.
Brokaw now reprimands a growingly unruly audience, asking it not to be as demonstrative.
7:03 p.m. Brokaw has now brought up A.B. 32, asking Whitman where she falls on the issue. “You at first said it was a job killer, then said you would suspend it for a year then examine it,” Brokaw begins, asking Whitman if she would kill a bill that would create green jobs for California.
Whitman responds, giving some background on A.B. 32, saying that the 12.4 percent unemployment rate wouldn’t be fixed by the 3 percent of jobs that fall under the green economy. It’s not fair to the other 97 percent, she says, adding that she calls for a one-year moratorium for A.B. 32 to “see if we can’t nurture green jobs without driving the other 97 percent of the economy out of the state.”
Brown is now discussing the one-year moratorium, saying it won’t work because it’s “turning the clock back.” There are multiple benefits to the bill, he says, including low emissions and better renewable energy. “We’re going to use more California sun and more California wind, and we’re going to get it done,” Brown says.
Whitman responds, bringing up the 97 percent of non-green energy jobs, saying Brown ignored them. He responds by saying there would be jobs for people — retrofitting buildings to be more green, for example.
7:09 p.m. Brokaw asks Brown about education now, specifically the role of the teacher’s union in the education system. “A big role,” Brown says, saying the teachers are a powerful union, but affirming that he is independent from their influence.
“I think Jerry Brown needs to get out and campaign more,” Whitman says, bringing A.B. 32 back to the conversation for unclear reasons. She says she constantly meets people on the campaign trail who need jobs, and A.B. 32 jeopardizes that.
She’s now on topic, talking about the teachers’ union. The biggest problem, she says, is there is no “kid association.” “I want to defend the children,” she says to audience applause.
7:12 p.m. Brokaw now addresses Whitman, talking about how much money she’s spent. He raises a question, however, that if she were so invested in the state political process, why she didn’t vote. The audience claps.
“I am not proud of my voting record, it was wrong and I take full accountability,” she says. “I apologize to the people of California.”
She’s now talking about the California Dream and how if she were elected, she can work in Sacramento “with no strings attached,” because of the fact that she’s spent her own money and is a political outsider. “I can bring a common sense approach from the real world,” she says. “This was always supposed to be a citizen’s democracy.”
Brown responds, saying his entire campaign has been supported by a variety of campaigns and groups, unlike Whitman, who has been supported by “rich campaign contributors.”
7:15 p.m. Brokaw brings up immigration, reminding Whitman that she said businesses and households need to be held accountable for hiring illegal immigrants and asking about her personal experience with an undocumented worker. “If you can’t find someone in your own home, how do you expect businesses to be able to?”
Whitman throws her former employee under the bus, saying that multiple documents were forged and although “it broke my heart,” she fired her. This shows why a better system is needed to verify the documents, Whitman says. The border also needs to be bolstered, with technology and border patrol agents. A temporary guest worker program also needs to be created within the state, she says.
Brown has the chance to respond about businesses hiring undocumented workers, and he says that businesses should be held accountable, but that this is a federal issue under the U.S. Constitution. “The biggest problem here,” Brown says, is that millions of people are “living in the shadows.” “What are we going to do about them? What is she going to do about them? Deport them?” Brown asks. “These are real people,” Brown says, taking a jab at Whitman for not hiring her former employee a lawyer after working with her for nine years.
As far as temporary workers, Brown says it’s too similar to a serf system. “I don’t think it’s human and I don’t think it’s right,” he says to much audience applause.
7:20 p.m. Brokaw is now bringing drug cartel violence into the immigration question, asking if either candidate has any plans to address illegal drug use in the state.
Brown says the Department of Justice has taken down several drug cartels, and rattles off a list of cities as proof. The state is at risk of cartel overspill from Mexico, he says, and gangs are also an issue. “It’s a very high priority, and as Attorney General, I have made it a high priority.”
Brokaw now asks Whitman, an opponent of Prop 19, what she would do if the proposition passed.
“I am firmly opposed to Proposition 19,” Whitman says, adding that people should really ask law enforcement officials. Whitman says “every single law enforcement official in the state” opposes Prop 19, despite the fact that many officials have actually sponsored the bill.
7:23 p.m. Now Whitman is talking about Prop 8, which she says she does not support. She’s drawing Brown into the coversation, saying as attorney general, Brown has the responsibility of defending the proposition in court. Brown has refused to do so. “I think that’s really dangerous,” Whitman says, “I don’t think you can have an attorney general who can decide what part of the constitution he wants to defend and what part he doesn’t.”
Brown says he is following precendent, saying a previous attorney general did not defend something he thought was a discriminatory measure.
“When something is so fundamentally wrong …” Brown begins, saying that the measure was dealt with by the judge who declared it unconstitutional. “I’m not going to be the one to take that up,” Brown said.
Brown’s talking about his stance on crime and fumbles a bit with his wording, because of which Whitman calls him out.
Brokaw asks Brown how he thinks President Barack Obama has done in office, and if he’s like the president to come campaign for him. Brown rattles off a list of Obama’s accomplishments, saying he think he’s “done a good job,” to audience applause.
Whitman is now asked about Palin and if she’s ask for her advice. “You know what, she has a real following in the Republican Party,” Whitman says, talking a bit about the other Republicans she supports instead. When Palin is in California on Saturday, Whitman will be talking to Californians about one of her talking points — jobs.
7:28 p.m. Brokaw asks if the political scene needs to be reformed. Whitman responds by talking about jobs again, but is cut off because of time. Brown is now responding, saying that he’s been “in the kitchen, in the heat,” and Whitman has been in the “bleachers.” Brown says he loves California, but is cut off because of time.
The debate is now over, and the two candidates cross the stage to shake hands.
Election Year Medicaid Medicare Inducement issues left open for November not openly discussed.Politics have gone from heated to man on fire thoughts. Also the Judicial dilemmas, since all are offically allowed to bear arms again, the big city Mayors are concerned about how the poor will be able to rearm themselves, and are looking for some type of financial relief from Federal State Medicaid programs to maintain their status quo.The higher courts face tough issues this term since making honest fraud legal, there agenda now turns toward making honest kickbacks and honest bribes equally as legal. This topic remains high as a shared issue by the medicaid medicare enrollment providers since they are looking to expand inducements past the complicated pregnancy stage.
The DOJ has serious concerns that if legalized marijuana in California for medical reasons could be used as a inducement or inticement to help secure new enrollments for the Federal State Medicare Medicaid programs.The State of California is concerned that if the Feds step up their effort in killing off the marijuana crops it could cause higher tax problems that effect Medicaid currently under consideration by the State ‘marijuana tax control board’. Limo drivers cancel their planned Medicaid Cuts DC rally and leave for California to protect this years crop. Wow, don’t think I would like to be in Politics for this years elections. Govenor Schwarzenegger indicated that if the Tea Partys membership keeps holding their rallies at our Marijuana burning fields they will have to be taxed for their free use of inhalants, prior to having them bused back to Arizona. Senator Mccain wants the deportation of illegal Mexicans to stop immediatley claims their State has gone to POT and insists Californis return his landscapers at once.
The questions seemed to be very one sided and mean’t to be an attack on Meg. The only question
that even went close to questioning Jerry’s integrity was the whore question. I think the questions in a debate like this should be fair and balanced, equal questions for each side. Just a thought!
I kept waiting for Brown to say (a la Dan Ackroyd), “Meg, you ignorant slut.”

The USC football team picked up its 12th verbal commitment for the class of 2011 in Orange County product Charles Burks out of Edison High School in Huntington Beach.
The 6-foot-1-inch, 230-pound Burks is rated a three-star prospect by ESPN and Rivals.com and is athletic enough to be described as a potential linebacker, defensive end or fullback when he joins the USC football team next fall.  Burks also fielded offers from Duke, Boise State, Stanford and several other Division I schools before committing to USC last night.
Originally, Defensive and Recruiting Coordinator Ed Orgeron required that Burks enroll in the spring in order to be offered a scholarship but recently lifted the restriction so that Burks could graduate with his fellow classmates.
“It’s a relief that I get to focus on playing football and enjoying my senior year,” Burks told the website WeAreSC.com. “They tell me, ‘You have what it takes to be out there and play with [the best of them].’”

Banksy sure knows how to get your attention.
As a famous, mysterious and highly talented street artist, his grafitti works challenge government, juxtapose shocking images on everyday streets and even alter storied works of art.
Yet for his latest stunt, Banksy did not resort to hanging a smiley-face Mona Lisa at the Louvre or illegally spray-painting his stenciled works  on street corners. Instead, Banksy lent his creative energy and bold personality to the latest episode of the long-running classic animated show The Simpsons.
The ever-familiar introduction to the show included Banksy’s name spray-painted on Springfield’s streets — but that was the tame part.
The controversial bit comes before the animated family settles down on its couch, when there is an extended scene which shows factory workers performing tedious in a shockingly morbid environment.
Obvious commentary is riddled throughout criticism of working conditions — highlighted by the bones littered on the ground, a child worker performing dangerous tasks and the abuse of animals, shown through everything from an emaciated unicorn to kittens being thrown in a wood chipper.
The gruesome scenes threatened to throw the entire episode overboard, as Banksy’s storyboard led to delays and raised questions about broadcast standards, BBC News reported.  It was the first time an artist has been invited to storyboard part of the show.
Cheers to this dysfunctional animated family.

With three weeks until Election Day, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics has released a voter’s guide covering the nine propositions California voters will decide on Nov. 2.
The guide contains information from the California Secretary of State Online Voter Information Guide about each proposition, explaining the results of either a “yes” or “no” vote for each prop, as well as pros and cons for voting either way.
The guide also includes the positions of both the USC College Republicans and USC College Democrats on each proposition.
Two of the propositions in particular — Prop 19, which would legalize limited amounts of marijuana for those over the age of 21, and Prop 23, which would suspend state regulations addressing global warming until the California unemployment rate drops — have garnered significant attention from politicians and voters within the state.
The guide isn’t all about the props, however. It also includes information about polling places near campus, a sample ballot and an explanation of how to register to vote through the USC chapter of the California Public Interest Research Group, which will hold a week-long voter registration drive this week.
Copies of the guide are available in the Unruh Institute, located in room 263 of the Von KleinSmid Center.

The No. 8 USC women’s volleyball team consistently comes out of the gate strong against its opponents. The question is: What happens after this solid start?
Spike · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter’s kill gave the Women of Troy a 16-15 lead they wouldn’t relinquish in the fifth set Saturday. - Jesse Bowman | Daily Trojan 
That might be the most appropriate story line when looking at the two matches the Women of Troy played this weekend against No. 1 Stanford and No. 7 California at the Galen Center.
USC (14-2, 3-2) ended up going 1-1, losing to Stanford in four sets Friday (18-25, 25-23, 25-20, 25-15) before defeating California in five sets Saturday (25-19, 25-23, 23-25, 23-25, 17-15).
Saturday night’s match against Cal was as exciting as it was nerve-wracking. USC went up two sets and took a 7-0 lead in the third behind outstanding serves from junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter. But shortly after, Cal started chipping away at the gap, scoring five straight points and taking a 14-13 lead. The Golden Bears later won the third set before taking the fourth as well.
“Sometimes you relax just a little bit when you get a 7-0 lead or any kind of lead like that, and the other team gets momentum, and then you can’t get back on top no matter what the score is,” USC coach Mick Haley said.
Fortunately, the Women of Troy still had some fight left in them. In the fifth set, USC was down 14-12 and one point away from suffering a loss. After a block by freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard and a hitting error by Cal, the score was suddenly 14-14.
After a Cal kill put USC down a point for the second time, Jupiter came up big with a winning kill and block, giving USC the 16-15 lead. A hitting error by the Bears on the next point gave the Women of Troy the hard-fought win.
Haley said he was impressed with the way his young players competed in Saturday’s match, especially after they had just come off a loss.
“We made enough mistakes to lose it. On the other hand, we forced the other team into enough mistakes that we had a chance to win it, and when we had the opportunity, we took it, which is very encouraging,” Haley said.
Jupiter agreed.
“You can’t be scared to lose. Obviously, you don’t want to make any mistakes and you want to be flawless at that point, but you have to go all out. Playing scared is not going to get you anything really, so it just comes down to confidence,” Jupiter said.
Jupiter, who referred to Saturday’s match as both intense and fun, ended the night with an impressive 26 kills. Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana added 15 kills, while Olgard had 12.
The final result was not as sweet Friday. After taking the first set against the Cardinal, USC was unable to win another. Stanford’s Alix Klineman gave the Women of Troy a difficult time, recording 27 kills and helping the Cardinal earn its sixth straight win against USC.
The Women of Troy had a chance to go up 2-0 in the match, serving with the score tied at 23-23 late in the second set. A serving error by freshman libero Natalie Hagglund, however, gave the Cardinal a one-point lead and the eventual victory.
Haley largely attributed the loss to a lack of focus on the part of his players.
“They looked like they were looking at the situation and not sure of themselves,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy did their best not to let the upsetting loss faze them, as they knew they had to focus on Cal.
“I think we can learn from what happened, but we can’t get down on ourselves. We have to keep our confidence. We’re a good team,” junior setter Kendall Bateman said.
After a draining weekend for the Women of Troy, Haley said he was able to walk away satisfied, having seen what his team was truly made of, and confident there were some valuable lessons his players could take away.
“There’s always a chance to be successful if you just stay with it,” Haley said.

Sometimes, an underdog simply capitalizes on its chances and has one or two players outperform expectations. Such was the case Saturday when the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (15-1) suffered a 5-3 loss — its first of the season — to No. 6 Stanford (7-4).
The Trojans’ inexperience showed for the first time this season as the team admittedly struggled to overcome its first encounter with adversity. Stanford goalie Brian Pingree thwarted many Trojan scoring opportunities, denying a barrage of quality shots and recording 14 saves on the afternoon. The masterful goaltending emboldened an already raucous Stanford crowd that jeered the youthful Trojans for the entire match.
Stuffed - Junior two-meter Matthew Burton was held scoreless as the Trojan offense couldn’t mount an attack Saturday and had trouble finding the net. The Trojans shot just 3-for-26 as they lost for the first time this season. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan
“The crowd surprised us. They had a ton of fans there that were heckling us, and that took us out of our game a little bit,” junior two-meter Matthew Burton said. “When they first came out, they had some great intensity.”
Uncharacteristically, the Trojans — averaging a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation-leading 15.4 goals per game — were held scoreless in the first period and trailed 3-1 at halftime, with freshman driver Nikola Vavic contributing the only tally.
“We haven’t had one single game all season where the goalie blocked seven of our shots in the first quarter,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We actually shot the ball well in practice, but we did not shoot well in the game. We were 3-for-26 in shooting. That’s a terrible percentage.”
The second half began inauspiciously for the Trojans, as Stanford increased its lead to an insurmountable four goals with just 10 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. USC sophomore utility Mace Rapsey scored two meaningless goals, rendering the score more palatable at 5-3.
Although tarnishing what had been a perfect record, this hiccup might benefit the Trojans in the long run. Accustomed to fast starts, USC now knows what it takes to mount a comeback. Certainly, playing in the hostile Avery Aquatic Complex was also instructive for the young team.
“You obviously don’t want it to happen, but it’s a good learning experience for us to see what it’s like to go down and have some adversity,” redshirt sophomore two-meter Zayne Balel said. “From now on, we should know what we need to do to come back.”
One Trojan drew a parallel between this loss and USC’s loss to UCLA last year at the NorCal Tournament, expecting this setback to reinvigorate his team.
“This kind of thing happened last year. We had a tough loss against UCLA and we were able to turn things around,” Burton said. “We won every game after that and ended up winning a championship. It’s much better to lose now than to lose later. We have to learn from this loss and get ready for Cal.”
As Burton mentioned, there is no opportunity for the team to dwell on this loss because No. 4 UC Berkeley — a team the Trojans have yet to face — is next on the docket. The USC men’s water polo team will play its second home game of the season against the Bears on Saturday at 10 a.m.

After a strong non-conference showing, the No. 20 USC women’s soccer team kicked off Pac-10 play this weekend against No. 1 Stanford and No. 21 California.
On fire · Freshman midfielder Elizabeth Eddy scored a hat trick Sunday against Cal to help lift the Trojans to a 5-4 overtime victory. - Dario Griffin | Daily Trojan 
Despite a tough loss to Stanford Friday at the Coliseum, the Women of Troy (8-3-2) came back strong Sunday afternoon and responded with a 5-4 sudden-death overtime victory against No. 21 California   (6-3-4). The Women of Troy won the game five minutes into overtime after they received a free kick. Redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval did the rest as she placed the ball in the top right corner of the goal, putting an end to a wild game that gave the Women of Troy a hard-fought victory.
“We should have had them in the beginning, but it turned out to be an entertaining game,” Sandoval said. “[I] had to stay calm and focus on that one shot and just put it in.”
USC almost didn’t make it to overtime, as Cal forward Alex Morgan completed her hat trick with just two minutes left in regulation to give the Golden Bears a 4-3 lead.
The Women of Troy refused to quit and responded 14 seconds later, when freshman midfielder Elizabeth Eddy completed a hat trick of her own to tie the game 4-4 and send it to overtime.
“Our team showed a lot of character to pull out the win,” Eddy said. “We worked hard to get back each goal and we got it done.”
The Women of Troy gained an early lead, scoring two goals within the first 3:30 of the game.
Senior forward Megan Ohai added to her already-impressive résumé at USC with a shot that found its way inside the top left corner of the post. A few minutes later, Eddy scored her first goal of the day, giving the Women of Troy a 2-0 lead.
Despite holding a early two-goal advantage, USC allowed the Golden Bears to get back into the game — and momentarily take the lead — in the second half.
In the 65th minute, Cal forward/midfielder Lauren Battung scored her fourth goal of the season to cut the lead in half, 2-1.
“A 2-0 lead is the most dangerous score in the game,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We knew if they got one, we knew it would be a dogfight.”
And the game turned out to be exactly that as the Women of Troy and Golden Bears engaged in a seesaw battle the rest of the way.
The Women of Troy responded in the 75th minute when Cal goalkeeper Emily Kruger vacated the net after a defensive breakdown and Eddy poked the ball to the far right post to give the Women of Troy a 3-1 lead.
But in a game where the temperature reached more than 90 degrees, forcing two USC defenders, freshman Mia Bruno and junior Claire Schloemer, out of the game, Khosroshahin had to juggle the lineup.
“When you change your backline, problems can occur because of the continuity you have,” Khosroshahin said. “We don’t really change a whole lot back there, but we had to change it a lot.”
With some of the Trojans’ key defenders missing, the Golden Bears took advantage, cutting the lead to a single goal again when Morgan headed in a ball off a free kick to make it 3-2.
Before the win Sunday afternoon, USC played host to the top-ranked Cardinal on Friday night at the Los Angeles Coliseum. USC fell short, losing 2-1 to Stanford (10-0-2) in front of an announced crowd of 1,429.
“You got to give our ladies credit,” Khosroshahin said. “They kept fighting and kept battling. I thought we had more chances than [Stanford] did, but they just capitalized on the opportunities they had.”
In the first half, the Women of Troy had numerous opportunities to strike, most notably when Eddy was able to break free from her defender, creating havoc for the Stanford backline.
There was a scramble in front of the Stanford net, and the Women of Troy had three shots on goal but were denied by the Cardinal’s defense and goalkeeper Emily Oliver.
In the second half, it wasn’t long before the Cardinal would break the tie — in the 59th minute, forward Christen Press knocked a shot from outside the box into the top left corner of the goal post, giving her team a 1-0 advantage.
“We lost a little bit of momentum after we had a couple of great chances,” Khosroshahin said. “That’s a quality team that capitalizes on the opportunities they have.”
The Cardinal would add an insurance goal in the 65th minute when Stanford midfielder Teresa Noyola managed to get her shot just past USC freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church, giving the Cardinal a 2-0 lead.
“We just gave them too much time on the ball,” senior defender Karter Haug said. “They’re really good players, and if we give them that much time, they’re going to find the goal.”
Though the Women of Troy were trailing, they refused to give up. In the 84th minute, Bruno scored her second goal of the year, cutting the lead in half.
However, it would be too late for a comeback as Stanford held on to win, 2-1.
Khosroshahin said his players showed a lot of heart, refusing to give up when their backs were against the wall.
“We have a [great] team,” Khosroshahin said. “They just got to believe it. The ladies just showed unbelievable character.”

The ITA/Riviera Women’s All-American Championships ended this weekend, and USC walked away with moderate success.
The doubles pair of junior Alison Ramos and sophomore Valeria Pulido made it to the quarterfinals in the main draw. In singles, although two USC players did make it into the main draw, Ramos and sophomore Danielle Lao did not make it past the round of 32.
Pulido and Ramos won four straight matches to make it to the doubles quarterfinals in the tournament. However, they were defeated by a doubles pair from Cal, 9-7. Ramos said she was pleased with the results of the tournament nonetheless.
“I think Val and I did extremely well. I’m just really proud of our results. We beat some tough teams and made huge improvements in our doubles since last year and were a lot more aggressive,” Ramos said. “This tourney was our coming-out party.”
The Women of Troy did not make it as far into the tournament as they might have hoped, but USC coach Richard Gallien said before the tournament that regardless of their performance the tournament was not anything to overanalyze.
“If we have the winner and the runner up, it means nothing for when we play UCLA later in the year. [This tournament] is just preparation,” Gallien said.
Other USC participants included freshman Kaitlyn Christian and senior Cristala Andrews, both of whom did not make it past the pre-qualifying rounds in singles. The promising freshman, who was ranked No. 9 in the preseason Freshman/Newcomer ITA rankings, won her first two matches in the pre-qualifying round but lost the third against a UNLV player. This stopped her from moving up to the qualifying round and into the main draw. Andrews lost her first match in the pre-qualifying rounds and was also unable to move forward in the tournament.
The doubles pair of Lao and senior Lyndsay Kinstler also did not make it past the pre-qualifying round.
Still, the team is not discouraged by its losses in the tournament.
“Overall, we did okay as a team. The competition was really good and there were just a lot of tough girls,” Ramos said. “We didn’t really post great results in singles and that’s because our No. 1 girl didn’t play.”
Senior Maria Sanchez, who ranked at No. 3, was unable to participate in the tournament because of compliance issues.
The tournament is just one of many the Women of Troy will compete in before Pac-10 play starts later in the season. They are set to play next in the ITA Southwest Regional Championships, which starts Oct. 21 in San Diego.

You’ve got to believe!”
No resistance · Stanford running back Stepfan Taylor jumps over a pile of Cardinal and Trojan players for a 1-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Stanford kicked a last-second field goal as the Trojans lost on the final play for the second week in a row. - Dieuwertje Kast| Daily Trojan 
USC sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley used these words to urge his offense on, not willing to let the Trojans give in as they trailed Stanford late in the game.
The Trojans didn’t. They believed. They fought. They did all they could, only to come up short once again.
USC lost for the second straight week in the same gut wrenching way. Nate Whitaker’s 30-yard field goal sailed through the uprights as time expired, ensuring both a 37-35 Stanford win and another week of USC wondering what could have been.
“You’ve got to believe!”
Barkley told reporters about his motivational words as he stood bleary-eyed and stone-faced. He got his team to believe Saturday night; there’s no doubt.
But will it continue to?
USC’s confidence has been fragile since the season began. With the sanctions and coaching changes, it was already going to be a challenge to keep the Trojans mentally prepared week in and week out.
Piling on two consecutive emotionally debilitating losses only makes it more dangerous. The Trojans now find themselves on a tipping point where one side leads to a respectable season under unfortunate circumstances and the other leads to complete deterioration.
How will the Trojans continue to believe?
“It just stings because — for me at least, and for a lot of our team — we were the highest of highs that we had been all year,” Barkley said. “And then it just shoots right back down to the lowest of lows.”
The Trojans’ greatest challenge moving forward will not be Oregon or Arizona, but themselves. How the Trojans handle these emotional letdowns and that empty feeling in their gut will define this season.
“It just feels sick,” Barkley said.
The veteran players are going to be fine. They’re mature enough to know these games happen and wise enough to have short-term memories.
“I know there’s a lot of guys that are hanging their heads in there, a lot of the younger guys,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “You’ve just got to understand that it’s a game and it’s a lot more than just wins and losses.
“A lot of times it’s just about how you respond.”
How the less-experienced Trojans react is now of greatest concern. They didn’t come to USC to lose to Washington and Stanford. They didn’t sign up to be sanctioned underdogs. What’s to stop them from coasting through the rest of a season that seems futile at times?
USC’s leaders must make sure that doesn’t happen. There is hope at least. After all, the Trojans were able to pick themselves up following the Washington loss in the face of all the naysayers.
“I was pleased by the way the team responded,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “This was a week where every time they picked up an article it was about ‘The USC dynasty is over’ and ‘It’s going to take 10 years to come back.’”
Kiffin understands the fragility of his players’ mindset after games like this, and he makes it a point not too be too hard on them.
“You’ve got to be careful about getting on kids after a game like that,” Kiffin said. “Where one play [happens differently] and you guys are all sitting here and saying, ‘Ah, what an unbelievable job.’”
True, USC deserves credit. It could’ve simply folded this week, much like it did last year when the game got tough against Stanford. But it didn’t. The Trojans believed.
The Trojans showed no signs of quitting Saturday night. Take freshman wide receiver Robert Woods, for example.
I’m not talking about his accomplished receiving night of 224 yards and three touchdowns. I’m talking about how coaches had to literally take away his helmet so that he would take a breather on special teams.
Then there was redshirt junior linebacker Shane Horton, who stepped in for injured senior linebacker Malcolm Smith to lead the team with 10 total tackles.
“There was no question about effort,” Barkley said.
If a few plays had gone differently, the Trojans could be 6-0 right now. These heartbreaking losses are surely learning experiences at the very least.
“We’re growing,” Horton said.
They might be, but there has to be a limit. How many more losses like this can the Trojans take before they stop believing?

The men’s and women’s swimming teams flexed their muscles on Friday with commanding victories at the USC Invitational.
A number of swimmers set NCAA qualifying marks at the invitational, which included a dual meet and sprint session. Both squads took on Cal State Bakersfield during the dual meet, with the men winning 111-85 and the women posting a 141-52 victory. The Women of Troy also defeated University of San Diego 140-59 in the dual meet.
Senior Lyndsay DePaul said it was important for the team to post qualifying marks early in the season.
“We want to qualify for NCAAs hopefully by this December,” DePaul said. “That way it takes the pressure off us and allows us train for and focus on the NCAAs.”
DePaul starred for the No. 9 women’s team, notching wins in four different events and bettering the NCAA “B” cut in the 200-yard butterfly (1:56.45) and 200-yard breaststroke (2:15.03). Sophomore Tanya Krisman also set a qualifying mark in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:57.75.
“I think we’re doing better than we thought we’d be doing,” DePaul said. “Coach [Dave] Salo has been comparing us to the times we posted last season around this time, and we’re significantly faster across the board.”
Several other swimmers came up just short in their bid for a qualifying time. Freshman Kasey Carlson missed the NCAA “B” standard by six-tenths of a second in winning the 100-yard freestyle (50.91). She also took first in the 50-yard breaststroke (28.90). Sophomore Yumi So almost gave USC a third NCAA championship qualifier in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 2:01.47.
“We did pretty good considering the conditions,” DePaul said. “It was a long meet and we swam a lot of races.”
On the men’s side, freshman Vlad Morozov and sophomore Clement Lefert each won three races in their first meet of the season. Morozov set an NCAA “B” mark in the 50-yard freestyle (20.05), while Lefert, a member of the French national team, set “B” marks in the 200-yard freestyle (1:37.66) and the 200-yard butterfly (1:47.87).
“I was pretty happy about my results,” Lefert said. “I tried to give my best in every race to get closer to my times [from last season].”
Freshman Alex Lendrum won the 200-yard IM (1:53.06) and 50-yard backstroke (23.58) in his USC debut.
“We have a great incoming freshman class,” Lefert said. “They have been training hard, and it was time for them to experience a dual meet. They will definitely provide great support for our relays this season.”
USC had a significant advantage in numbers for most of the races, with several heats featuring exclusively Trojan swimmers. Still, DePaul said the team is happy with the outcome.
“It doesn’t matter who’s in the pool with us,” she said. “We’re going to race and we’re going to swim as fast as we can. We know that our team in some cases is our biggest competition because we have a lot of depth.”
The men’s team beat Cal State Bakersfield 104-40 during the sprint session. Scores were not kept for the women’s team during this part of the meet.
Next up for the teams is the Distance Swim Challenge on Saturday in Manhattan Beach, Calif.

The end of Saturday’s game at Stanford brought a familiar feeling to the USC locker room — one the Trojans do not like.
“It feels sick. It feels sick to lose,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said. “I think we all hate this feeling. It’s very disappointing.”
Dagger · Stanford kicker Nate Whitaker, who missed an extra point, kicked the game-winning field goal. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
For the second week in a row, USC (4-2, 1-2) lost on a last-second field goal and watched the opposing team dance around the field. This weekend, Stanford (5-1, 2-1) was the antagonist.
Stanford kicker Nate Whitaker kicked the 30-yard game-winning field goal to give the Cardinal a 37-35 victory and send the Trojans home with back-to-back losses for the first time since 2001.
“This was the second week in a row we had a chance to finish someone off, a very good team, and we didn’t do it,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “If you have an opportunity to close it out, you gotta close it out.”
Just one minute before Whitaker’s kick, it looked as if USC had the win in its pocket.
After redshirt freshman cornerback Torin Harris recovered a fumble forced by redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo on the 50-yard line with 4:17 left, Barkley took over.
He converted a fourth down en route to driving the team down for a three-yard touchdown run by senior tailback Allen Bradford with 1:08 remaining to put USC up 35-34, after Whitaker missed the extra point on Stanford’s previous touchdown.
The Cardinal was able to march down the field almost at will, however — five plays in a row went for a first down — before kicking the game-winning field goal. In a game where it seemed like the team that had the ball last would win, that’s how it played out.
“For us and our team, it’s the highest of high we’ve been all year and then it shoots down to the lowest of lows,” Barkley said.
The Cardinal was helped by a late hit penalty on Galippo on the second play of the series.
“There was no whistle,” Galippo said. “All I was trying to do was get him to the ground. I saw that Shane wrapped him up, and I saw that he was still standing, and I knew the game was on the line, and that every yard counted, so I just tried to drive him back like anyone else would.”
That play marred a solid performance by Galippo, the starter-turned-backup, who saw the most playing time of his season relieving sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard. The best performance of the day, however, went to freshman receiver Robert Woods.
Woods caught 12 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns — all of which are career highs. The freshman tied the game at 14, 21 and 28, as the Trojans kept coming from behind to match the Stanford offense.
“He was doing really well,” Barkley said. “He was getting open, making guys miss. I can only do so much when I give him a five-yard pass, he takes it 40 yards or whatever, so he played really well. I said this all along: I’m really proud of him and how he’s going.”
Those yards after the catch helped Barkley, who went 28-for-45 with 390 yards and three touchdowns — all to Woods. Barkley kept the Trojans in the game with his arm — and his feet  — when USC couldn’t establish a running attack. Barkley was the team’s leading rusher with 39 yards on five carries.
That reminded Kiffin of a certain player that beat the Trojans one week ago.
“I thought Matt really played like [Washington quarterback] Jake [Locker] did last week,” Kiffin said. “He made so many big critical plays and threw a lot of really, really good balls. That’s good for a true sophomore to be where he’s at.”
Unfortunately for the Trojans, they have left too much time on the clock late in the last two games. Their defense — which  did improve this week, forcing three fumbles — couldn’t come up with a stop when it needed it most.
“We’re giving them big chunks of plays and you can’t do that,” linebackers coach Joe Barry said. “Whether it be the penalty, through the air, missing a tackle or giving up a big run. The same thing happened last week, on [fourth-and-11]. If you want to win consistently, in two-minute defense you have to make teams earn every blade of grass, and right now we’re not doing that.”
