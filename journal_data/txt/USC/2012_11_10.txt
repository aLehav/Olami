Monte Kiffin’s battered baseball cap titled over his brow as he glanced toward the ground.
“It’s hard to talk about Oregon right now,” said the Trojans’ assistant head coach for defense when last week’s performance was brought up.
Understandably, it was hard to talk about Oregon. Just seven days earlier, Kiffin’s defense had surrendered school single-game records for points allowed, 62, and yards allowed, 730, in a primetime, nationally televised showdown against the No. 4 Ducks.
So Saturday’s Homecoming game versus Arizona State at the Coliseum represented an opportunity for USC to turn the page and begin anew. And at last, after consecutive losses, something clicked on the defensive side.
The Trojans’ defense surrendered just 10 points and 250 total yards, including just three points — a 28-yard field goal from Jon Mora — and 76 yards in the second half.
“We’re not the Steel Curtain by any means,” Kiffin said, alluding to the famed Pittsburgh Steelers defenses of the 1970s, “but that sure felt good today.”
The 250 yards allowed was USC’s lowest total for any game all season, equaling the same mark set during a Sept. 22 contest against California and a far cry from the 1,318 yards surrendered in its previous two losses. And similar to its victory over Cal, No. 19 USC (7-3, 5-3) was able to win in convincing fashion, 38-17.
“I feel like we got better today,” said freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams, who finished with one of the team’s seven sacks. “That’s the biggest thing.”
Woods a little off
It might’ve been yet another Heisman Trophy-like performance for sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, who caught 10 passes for 161 yards and one touchdown, but it was far from a banner day for Robert Woods. The junior wide receiver logged his worst statistical performance of the season, with just two receptions for -3 yards.
“I wish I was making more plays, of course,” said Woods. “But either than that, I’m proud of Marqise for making those plays.”
On the season, Woods has caught 61 passes for 653 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Lee attributed to the drop in production Saturday to circumstances and the fact defenses still “always play” to Woods.
“He gives up himself up for me, basically,” said Lee, a former high school teammate at Junipero Serra in Gardena, Calif.
Added USC coach Lane Kiffin, “He’s human. You want the ball. You play receiver, you want the ball. It was nothing negative. Just, from our relationship, I could feel him. He was a little bit down.”
Deflated footballs
USC announced late Wednesday night it had been reprimanded and fined $25,000 by the Pac-12 after a student manager had intentionally deflated game footballs below NCAA-mandated pressure levels during a Nov. 4 game against Oregon.
The school subsequently fired the manager.
When asked during the post-game news conference if the ordeal had served as a distraction among players in the days leading up to Saturday’s game, senior quarterback and captain Matt Barkley insisted it hadn’t.
“I don’t think players were really really talking about it in the locker room or anything like that,” said Barkley. “There’s attention on it in social media or what the media pushes out but we weren’t talking about it. Just brush it off and focus on football.”
When further questioned if he had been aware of the deflation, he responded “no.”
“I didn’t know anything was going on and I can’t tell the difference,” Barkley said.
Drop in penalties
For much of the season, USC has stayed the most penalized team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, but for the second straight week, it put a damper on this lingering problem. The Trojans were penalized just four times against Arizona State for 30 yards. The week prior versus Oregon, it had been penalized three times for 25 yards.

USC coach Lane Kiffin described it as continued “bad karma” in a week replete with controversy after a student manager was fired for deflating game balls during the first half of last Saturday’s defensive debacle against Oregon.
Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Only 45 minutes before kickoff, sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee entered Kiffin’s office with a swollen face after suffering an allergic reaction to something he ate. Kiffin figured there was no chance the star wideout would recover in time for the game.
But Lee received sufficient treatment and emerged out of the Coliseum tunnel with his teammates in time for another transcendent performance — catching 10 passes for 161 yards and adding 66 yards on the ground — buoying No. 19 USC to a 38-17 win over Arizona State.
“He’s every bit deserving,” senior quarterback Matt Barkley said of Lee’s recent Heisman buzz. “He’s the best player in his position. He’s done some tremendous things this year as a receiver and kick returner and across the board.”
Down 7-0 in the first quarter, Barkley completed an 80-yard touchdown strike to Lee, in which the sophomore sensation knifed through double-coverage and outran his pursuers, gliding into the end zone after junior wide receiver Robert Woods supplied one final block.
“I’m thinking, ‘This isn’t happening,’” Kiffin said when recounting Lee’s pregame visit. “As well as he played, that long touchdown pass isn’t even contested if he’s feeling himself. He’s arguably the best player in college football.”
The comfortable final victory margin and Lee’s continued fireworks belied what began as a competitive game in which the Trojans returned to the locker room at halftime amid a smattering of boos tied with ASU at 14 points apiece.
“I don’t really hear it,” Barkley said when asked about the boos entering halftime. “I kind of block out the noise, so I don’t hear those.”
USC committed three turnovers in the first half, including two interceptions to punctuate drives where the Trojans were poised to score touchdowns.
On the ensuing kickoff after Lee’s 80-yard score, senior linebacker Tony Burnett forced a fumble, which redshirt freshman linebacker Anthony Sarao recovered at the Sun Devils’ 29-yard line. Barkley threw an interception on the next play, however, as ASU linebacker Chris Young made a sprawling catch on the sideline that was upheld after Kiffin’s challenge.
ASU’s next possession ended prematurely on senior safety T.J. McDonald’s second interception of the season, but Barkley and the USC offense proceeded to squander the short field opportunity. After a Woods offensive pass interference penalty negated a touchdown and a delay of game penalty set up a third-and-24 situation, Barkley threw a 76-yard pick-six to ASU safety Alden Darby on a swing pass.
Undeterred, USC struck back to conclude the first half on a 13-play, 79-yard drive that culminated in a four-yard touchdown pass to sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble.
“We know the standards here,” Kiffin said. “Coming up the tunnel with an Arizona State player I know well, we’re getting booed off the field with it as a tied game at half, and the player gave me a look; well, that’s just L.A.”
The second half also began inauspiciously for USC, as Barkley threw his third interception on a pass tipped by onrushing defensive end Carl Bradford, who corralled the deflection as he fell to the ground. The play marked only the second time in his career that Barkley has thrown three interceptions in a game, with the last coming against Stanford in his freshman season.
ASU later capitalized on USC’s fourth turnover with a 28-yard field goal. The Sun Devils’ third score would mark the last time they notched points on the scoreboard, however, as the Trojans proceeded to score 24 unanswered points to bury ASU.
Senior running back Curtis McNeal emerged as the catalyst behind USC’s second-half surge. With Silas Redd unavailable, the Trojans’ other returning 1,000-yard rusher ran for 112 of his game-high 163 yards in the second half.
“It felt good,” McNeal said. “I’m worried about getting a ‘W’ even if I don’t get the ball.”
In addition to a five-yard rushing touchdown, McNeal nimbly broke a couple of ankle tackles in the third quarter on a short screen pass that he ultimately converted into a 22-yard touchdown reception. Surprisingly, the two scores mark the only times he has visited the end zone in 2012.
“A lot of credit to the offensive line and Curtis. He had a great game except for the fumble at the end,” Kiffin said. “If you look at the hidden stats, the negative plays … Curtis only lost one yard today.”
The embattled defensive unit arguably put forth its best performance of the season, especially considering the fact that seven of the points surrendered came from Barkley’s pick-six in the second quarter. USC’s defensive front-seven, which was gashed by the Ducks’ rushing attack, rebounded nicely, registering seven sacks for 56 yards split between six defenders.
“Our guys were really more aggressive,” Kiffin said. “Not in defensive calls, but really the front-seven.”
The vaunted Sun Devils’ offense picked up a mere 71 yards on 35 carries. Moreover, USC stole three interceptions from ASU quarterback Taylor Kelly, who ranked third in the Pac-12 in passing efficiency entering the contest.
“It’s been rough, just because of the type of defense we are and the type of players we have,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “Others teams have gotten the best of us. … We needed to get that nasty taste out of our mouths.”
USC survived the “sandwich game” test against ASU between its nationally hyped heavyweight bout against Oregon and its rivalry showdown with UCLA this Saturday.
“These games can be hard when you’re sandwiched in a game like this [between Oregon and UCLA], with the snaps and the emotions and a crosstown rivalry next week,” Kiffin said. “I give a lot of credit to our assistant coaches and players.”
