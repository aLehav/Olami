USC running back Kenan Christon and his lawyer Anton Diffenderfer are accusing USC and its Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards of being racially insensitive regarding Christon’s suspension from the team and other school activities in September. 
Christon was suspended Dec. 14 because of an altercation with another USC student. The two students have now reconciled, according to Christon, but a six-week investigation by a USC judicial officer found Christon responsible for seven violations of student conduct.
He is now appealing the suspension, accusing Barton of completing an “incomplete and inadequate investigation,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
“We have looked at this in line with university policy and have taken appropriate action,” said the University in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We are unable to talk about the details because of student privacy laws.”
Members of the United Black Student-Athletes Association, Christon, Diffenderfer and civil rights activist Najee Ali hosted a press conference Tuesday in front of Galen Center asking the University and Student Affairs to reevaluate the case.
“I really want the appeals more to really look at [the suspension], and I feel if it’s anything like the investigation, they’re just going to rubber stamp it and move it down the line,” said Diffenderfer in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “So [the press conference] will hopefully get them to, you know, take the file and put it on top of other files and make it a priority.” 
Diffenderfer said the other student involved was not reprimanded and the investigation was solely focused on Christon. The investigators knew about the reconciliation between the two, but it “didn’t appear to have any bearing [on the situation],” he said.
USC also provided no reasoning as to why the other student was left out of the investigation, according to Diffenderfer. 
“When you look [at the case] on its face, it’s pretty unbelievable,” Diffenderfer said. “You got two students involved in something, and one is completely dismissed and the focus is just on [Christon] … It’s really about the process, and the process is just as terrible.”
Once he received word of his suspension, Christon was given 10 days to decide whether or not he would appeal. Diffenderfer called the appealing system “doomed from the beginning.”
“It’s almost impossible for me to do it in 10 days. There’s so much evidence and facts that we have to figure out,” he said. “It’s totally rigged to fail.”
Neither Diffenderfer nor Christon have been in contact with the Athletic Department regarding the suspension. Diffenderfer mentioned that the appeal process for Christon and Student Affairs was not similar to a “legal process.” 
“[Student athletes are] not allowed to be represented,” Diffenderfer said. “There’s nobody there to really help them through [the legal process] and make sure that they are asked fair questions and stuff like that. So they got to do it all by themselves.” 
Ali, a USC alumnus, spoke at the event noting previous instances of racial discrimination against Black student-athletes. 
He also argued USC continues to mistreat Black student athletes consistently. 
“I know, for a fact, that there’s always been a double standard in the way that white students and Black students have been treated,” Ali said. “We’re seeing Black student-athletes being punished very harshly and severely, but the white students have no punishment whatsoever.”
The outcome of Christon’s appeal will weigh heavily on Black athletes deciding whether or not they should attend USC, according to Ali. 
He offered the example of former USC wide receiver Munir McClain who was suspended in September 2020. McClain was suspended because of an investigation involving USC students planning to apply for Employment Development Department benefits during the coronavirus pandemic. McClain and his brother Abdul-Malik McClain eventually entered the transfer portal and left the University. 
Diffenderfer hopes USC will consider Christon’s appeal along with other pieces of evidence in the coming weeks. 
“I think, really, we’re just in a holding period now,” Diffenderfer said. “So nothing can really be done until we find out about the appeal and, from that, decide what needs to be done next, and hopefully, nothing.”

Content Warning: This article contains mentions of sexual assault. 
Following seven reports of sexual assault and drugging at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house and other locations on and off the Row in mid-October and a delay in the Department of Public Safety’s reports of the incidents, multiple student and faculty-led protests targeted USC administration and called for greater transparency and additional action. The Daily Trojan spoke with President Carol Folt Nov. 19 to discuss the administration’s plans to address sexual assault on campus going forward. 
This article is part one of a two-part interview with Folt and has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: There’s currently a ban on Interfraternity Council activity, but we’ve received several reports of fraternities violating the ban. What is USC doing to enforce the ban and how will they punish fraternities who violate the ban? 
Carol Folt: There’s a complication here. Those are people that live in privately owned houses on streets that are not part of the University and that are actually private property. So what we can do in that respect versus what we can do on our own property is very different. If they started having parties in those houses, I think there’s very strong reason to say they’re either closed down or they don’t get to come back, but a lot of them are allowed to be in their homes. 
I know that a lot of students are going to other places to have parties; that’s more concerning to me … We’re very worried about safety. I get worried if everything goes underground because our influence gets much less, but, to some extent, there’s some things we can do and some things we can’t. 
A lot of the IFC presidents are actually really trying. I do honestly believe that it’s hard for any individual … to control everyone within their group, so I think my hope is the more we can try to make things about working together to get better than punitive, the more likely we are to fix things.  
DT: Have you made specific efforts to stop the violations? 
CF: We have a whole task force that meets everyday, and that includes people from all those walks. They talk about it everyday, and they think about the things they can do. I personally met with all the IFC presidents, all the [Panhellenic] presidents and met with all the other student group presidents … I’m spending a lot of effort trying to talk to people, but then, I need to turn to the leaders in those areas to help them put in place that progress. 
DT: You talked about the difference between being punitive and bringing people together. How have you tried to bring people along? 
CF: There are things where you absolutely have to be punitive, but you also have to be sure that you really train people. You have to do your best to have trained people thoroughly, and then, you can have a zero tolerance policy. So a lot of this too is getting these trainings to be much better and making sure that people are complying with the rules that we have. 
DT: According to the email that came out from Provost Charles Zukoski about the Working Group, the goal is to expand to the broader University’s issues of sexual assault outside of IFC. What level of accountability does IFC need to achieve before the Working Group can reprioritize and think about other campus groups? 
CF: One thing that we’re working on right now is, “Do we allow a return to social activities?” I think that’s pretty obvious … It’s reasonable that our first and most important goals are training, safety and putting in new practices. 
There are many things that you can do to work and regulate how those parties and those activities go, and if we can get to the point that we thought that was safe, then we have to decide if we’ll allow rush to go, and, if we do, how will that go? We owe this to people because everyone’s determined that we have to find things that can work, so that’s a high priority. 
DT: USC admitted to the troubling delay in the report of these sexual assaults. What specific action has the University taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again? 
CF: The real problem there was that [the reports] came from [Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention Services] confidentially, which rarely ever reports … People choose confidentiality for a reason, so we don’t want to violate it, but they decided that they felt that they needed [to] alligate, so we really did have a team that wasn’t trying to hide anything but didn’t know what to do when it was out. So that’s what we fixed first — completely retrained, rewrote our policy that said that, even if this is elevated and got your attention by RSVP, it immediately has to go to the Clery [Act] and the TrojansAlert. 
DT: What is the University’s general tolerance for these persistent issues within fraternities? 
CF: It’s hard for me to go back and talk about what happened before I got here … I tend to want to start with the no tolerance for violence and hazing, severe actions when people do it, excessive, if needed … working on training and prevention, and when violation takes place, be as quick as you can with due process, and then take action, and I think that’s what we have to do and be consistent. 
DT: I’m curious about whether you think decertification [of Greek letter organizations] would lead to these issues getting stronger, just because there’s been a lot of statistics about how schools with Greek life have higher incidences of sexual assault, so I’m just not sure if the evidence supports that decertifying would hurt anything. 
CF: It is very untrue to think that there are many schools in America that don’t have something that acts very much like an IFC, so I think we have to start at that to say, “What are we trying to do? How much do we want to say?” … The real point is to eliminate … sexual assault, harassment and bullying, and for me, that’s the goal I have. I have less of a goal to terminate the social organization until I can figure out how to offer people alternatives. 
There’s all sorts of ideas out there about how one could really change [the] culture, but I think that’s what our longer conversation is … If you oversimplify it, [I think you’re making] a big mistake. But do I wish I could [wipe a clean] slate and do everything over? Yeah, I’d love to. I don’t know how one does that, but I do think that 10 years from now, we might be looking at that. I’m not sure that we’re going to know systems like these right now.

Off the back of a home loss to UCLA, USC (4-6) will return to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the last time this season to face No. 13 BYU (9-2). 
The Trojans are 2-1 against the Cougars, with the most recent game being a 2019 overtime 30-27 win for BYU in Provo, Utah. 
The last two games of the season dictate USC’s fate in terms of bowl eligibility, as the team needs a total of 6 wins to qualify for a bowl game. The Trojans have lost two straight games, the second being Saturday’s 62-33 loss to the Bruins.
“In every aspect you can imagine, I feel like we should get better,” interim Head Coach Donte Williams said in a press conference Sunday. “Whether that’s coaching, whether that’s playing … there’s something that we could’ve done better.”
USC is 2-4 at home this season with just one win in five Pac-12 home games. The Trojans haven’t lived up to expectations at the Coliseum, unable to capitalize on home-field advantage. 
“I don’t know another way to put it, but [it’s] disgusting,” Williams said in reference to USC’s home record. “That’s just something that we have to correct. It’s something different every time … and it almost seems like [the opponent is] in our huddle, calling our plays.”
Defensive woes have marred the Trojans at home this season. USC has allowed a staggering 45 points per game in home games against Pac-12 opponents. 
Away teams have made a habit out of breaking records at the Coliseum this season. Oregon State picked up a victory on the road against USC for the first time since 1960, Utah won in the Coliseum for the first time in 105 years and UCLA scored its most points ever against the Trojans. It’s become routine for opposing teams to have their best offensive performances when facing USC, a trend that indicates an inability to adapt defensively.  
Defensive Coordinator Todd Orlando declined to be interviewed after the game Saturday, telling media that he would speak with them Wednesday. 
As the season draws on, injuries have taken a toll on the squad. Junior wide receiver Drake London’s season is over, and other key contributors such as junior outside linebacker Drake Jackson and redshirt senior defensive lineman Nick Figueroa have played with injuries in recent weeks. Junior quarterback Kedon Slovis also missed the UCLA game with a lower leg injury, and his future remains uncertain. 
“[There are] a lot of guys that are playing a lot of football for us that we didn’t expect to have to play a lot of football for us this year,” Williams said. “We have a ton of injuries on this team, [but] that’s by far no excuse at all. All of these guys are on scholarship and gotta continue to get better, just like we gotta do a better job of coaching.” 
BYU’s season has gone according to plan, despite losing its quarterback Zach Wilson to the NFL draft last offseason. In Wilson’s place, sophomore quarterback Jaren Hall has seen the most playing time. In 9 games this season, he’s thrown for 256 yards per game with 18 touchdowns and 3 interceptions on the season. 
The BYU offensive scheme’s main threat is the run game. Sophomore running back Tyler Allgeier is ranked No. 5 in the nation in rushing yards with 1,298. He has 18 rushing touchdowns on the season, tied for second-most in FBS.  
The Trojans have struggled against strong running teams this season, giving up just over 172 rushing yards per game, making them the No. 96 ranked run defense in FBS. 
BYU is known for jumping on its opponents early in the games this season, outscoring opponents 107-33 in the first quarter. 
USC will take on BYU at 7:30 p.m. Saturday Nov. 27 at the Coliseum.

Prior to the start of USC’s 2020 football season, guest speakers in a Zoom meeting spoke to the team about the process of starting a business. 
Micah Croom, a safety who transferred to USC from Dartmouth as a graduate senior, unmuted himself and asked a question about LLC’s and sole proprietorships.
“That was everybody’s first time hearing his voice and seeing his face,” Croom’s then-new teammate, Chase Williams said. “Everybody’s like ‘Who’s this guy?’”
For Croom, pursuing interests outside of the football field has always been a priority. He learned Japanese because of his favorite childhood anime “Dragon Ball Z”, is working on obtaining a general contractor’s license and has a budding career in music production.
“He’s a Renaissance man,” said Brett Arce, a defensive quality control analyst at USC who works closely with Croom. 
Croom’s many talents are no surprise to those around him. As a USC football player with an Ivy League bachelor’s degree in political science, Croom is part of an exclusive club. He credits the achievement to himself and his father for believing in the importance of maximizing “the best of both abilities.” Along with his academic strength and his passions aside from football, Croom is, according to many, an excellent communicator who makes every conversation feel special.
“He has a way of connecting with people. If you sit down and talk to him, he can be very profound,” said Larry Croom, Micah’s father. “He can take you to a whole other level mentally.” 
Larry recalls having to talk to his son “almost like an adult” in his childhood because Micah’s line of questioning was always at a high level. His speaking ability is not lost on his teammates.
“He’s very detailed and articulate,” Williams said. “He can break things down and relate to everybody, bringing people together.” 
Williams described Micah as someone whose social circle extends far beyond football, remembering times where Croom would regularly tell teammates about restaurant recommendations and new connections he makes. 
Micah’s focus on education didn’t waver when he was recruited out of high school. He credits the success of the Stanford-NFL pipeline, specifically Richard Sherman’s journey, for validating his belief that he could balance football and a commitment to excelling in his pursuit of education.
After decommitting from Utah and instead committing to Dartmouth his senior year of high school, Micah received mixed reviews. Some coaches and family members wanted him to go to a Power Five school, but when Micah mentioned his interest in the Ivy League to teachers and mentors, they were ecstatic.
“When I would say, ‘Dartmouth’, you would see the look on their face change,” Micah said. “It was with so much sincerity that I knew this was something different and I might want to take a second look at it.” 
His time at Dartmouth and the ensuing educational success weren’t without their challenges. Micah battled through his first true injury as an athlete, unfulfilled promises and culture shock moving from Los Angeles to New Hampshire.
“Micah had to endure it on his own, all by himself,” said his mother, Tiffany Croom.
Micah’s parents said he reached a “stalemate” his freshman year at Dartmouth, finding it difficult to balance an Ivy League academic workload along with the demands of playing college football.
For Micah, the injury he suffered his sophomore year at Dartmouth took him out of the “world of being a football player” for the first time since his childhood. Micah was inspired to play football at a young age after watching his older brother, Larry Jr., play in the NFL. Micah has fond memories of watching his brother on television, calling him the “first superhero” he ever saw on screen, aside from “Dragon Ball Z”’s Goku. 
Micah was athletically active year-round from his elementary years through high school, alternating between track and football. Experiencing life as a “regular student” was daunting at first, but it allowed Micah to reflect on what else was important to him. The same person who had once acted in a play, played the saxophone and won chess championships in elementary school was being rediscovered. Only this time, his passion was for producing music. 
Micah said he became “enamored” with the process of music production, and quickly saw parallels between the heights he wanted to reach on and off the field. Being exposed to a new world where, as in football, there was no true ceiling on what he could accomplish made Micah even more dedicated. Williams said Croom helps teammates realize their opportunities for success off the field. 
“He makes you realize that there’s more outside of football,” Williams said. “He’s going to make you feel like a normal person.” 
Despite his other pursuits, Micah remains all the way locked into football. His dedication to contributing to the team’s success — in any capacity — was on full display in USC’s victory over Washington State earlier this season. 
USC trailed 14-7 at halftime when Micah forced a crucial Washington State fumble on the second-half kickoff to put the Trojans in prime position to draw even, take the lead and ultimately pick up a key victory in interim Head Coach Donte Williams’ first game at the helm. The game-changing play was a long time coming for Micah. Staying true to his calm demeanor, he returned to the sidelines and told the offensive players it was their turn to score.
“He’s the same guy whether it’s in the locker room or outside the locker room, his personality never changes,” Chase said. “He’s just more serious on the field.” 
 Micah’s stoicism and level-headed attitude make him a valuable asset to the team outside the white lines — he regularly studies film on his own time and calls out the opposition’s plays even from the sideline. Micah’s commitment to helping USC any way he can immediately stood out to Arce, who remembers walking into the film room late at night and finding Micah watching game tape alone more than once. 
USC is Micah’s fifth school since he started ninth grade, but his unconventional path has driven him to prove himself as a reliable and talented contributor, making a constant effort to connect with those around him. Micah’s hyper-focused attitude is clear to those around him. Arce called his personality “infectious.” 
Tiffany always had an inkling her son would end up at USC and it happened. As Micah continues to step into new avenues and develop new interests, his friends and family wait patiently for his next big move. 
Micah isn’t worried about what’s next for him. He’s open to extending his football career, moving into real estate, continuing to grow as a producer or exploring any other door his network at USC, Dartmouth and elsewhere will open for him.
“I’m always going to hold a high ceiling for myself and those around me,” Micah said. “I understand that this is a long journey for me.”

Content Warning: The following article contains references to sexual assault, drugging and violence.
A few weeks ago, I woke up in a frenzy of incomplete assignments and an overflowing email inbox. Although I wish I were one of those people who could simply garner the willpower to work without an external incentive, I fear that day may never come, and I may forever be confined to sourcing my work ethic from iced coffees and electropop at 10 in the morning.
I finished a day’s worth of work in the span of an hour, and something about it made me feel so powerful. Whether my serotonin came from cleaning the angry emails from my inbox or one of my two antidepressant medications’ triumph, I mostly attribute my motivation to the fact that “reputation” — you know, the album where Taylor Swift reflected on her widely publicized celebrity feuds and bridge-burns — was playing in the background. 
Thus, my “reputation” era was born. In a 2021 context, the album was so ahead of its time, and although I do not necessarily identify as a “Swiftie,” it exquisitely manifests my current persona and motivated me to write this letter. 
I must admit, though, that I revised, restarted and deleted this letter before deciding on this version. In my first draft, I aggressively expressed my anger. In fact, I planned to publish it on this day because I knew that when it inevitably enraged people on all sides of the political spectrum, I could flee to the East Coast where I would seek asylum over the break. 
I was angry about writing to walls: You can garner the support of thousands of students and faculty with a piece that criticizes a broken system, yet an optics-obsessed administration’s response tells you that they either didn’t read it, or they read it but they will only ever see you, the student, as a profiting vehicle. 
I’m still angry, but after some reflection on my own letter about reflection, I had a timely epiphany: As the opinion editor at Daily Trojan, I obviously want to express my opinions, and while I can use an open letter to rant as a form of catharsis, to what extent will my opinions be productive and invite readers instead of ostracizing them? 
Like Taylor amid her feuds with Katy Perry and Kanye West, I have been entangled in my fair share of controversy in the past few months, from my personal life to my professional — or as professional as you consider a University student-run newspaper — life. 
Media illiteracy has been a main source of this controversy. For instance, our social media comments for the Editorial Board piece read along the lines of, “Why is the Daily Trojan so biased and editorializing news?” 
Opinions, believe it or not, are not impartial. Newspapers’ opinion sections intend to bring perspectives to the limelight and invoke discourse — as long as said discourse does not incite violence against marginalized communities nor disseminate misinformation. 
More specifically, in light of our Editorial Board piece addressing sexual assaults committed at Interfraternity Council chapters, discourse has flooded my carpet from all sides of the aisle. 
Most of these responses deflect from the nuanced issue at hand; hence, I call them deflections. In oppressive systems of power, reform — a deflection in and of itself — is not possible because it does not actually prevent harm: It only saves face. 
I witnessed outrage from fraternity members, families of fraternity members and people who don’t know the fraternity members who committed sexual assault but assure they are all “very good and innocent people.” One Instagram comment accused us of accusing “a lot of innocent, wonderful people.”  
Members of Greek life perceived calls to abolish IFC as deflections from sexual assault. Queer men in fraternities scoffed at the piece, perceiving themselves as immune to misogyny and complicity in sexual assault. Students resorted to toxic unity, insisting the piece divided us and that we must come together to support each other in lieu of dismantling the structures and culture that enable the rapists who continue dividing us. 
Although I could defend the piece and advocate for the school’s widespread need for some Kimberlé Crenshaw and Intersectionality Theory all day, the piece planted a necessary seed in the community, which the student body, faculty and staff continue to cultivate everyday. Its aftermath does not only warrant a continuous discussion regarding rape culture and Greek life, but it also prompts introspection. 
I thought about my position as a senior; someone who will graduate in May with two USC degrees emblazoned on my resume forever — an educational opportunity for which I am forever grateful. 
However, USC’s culture of classism and entitlement continually disappoints and embarrasses me. Students flaunt their privilege and oblivion like assets — i.e. student-made signs during the UCLA football game reading, “My maid went to UCLA” and “Public school sucks.” 
I am at a crossroads: Despite USC’s entrenched flaws, I demand better and hope for it to eventually stop endangering students. But after witnessing the administration’s deflection strategies during the past three years, from optical responses to Black Lives Matter to the Sigma Nu aftermath, I do not anticipate that the University — no matter the amount of pressure from students, faculty, staff and community — will ever burn down the ugliness it sows. 
Just as I find it continually exhausting to demand better from the United States — and I write this immediately after hearing the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict — this administration continually tests my sanity. Its system benefits me as a white, cisgender man and has yet to desensitize me to its injustices.
At the same time, as someone living with mental illness, I am desensitized in so many other aspects of my life, making it even more exhausting to consistently feel like I have to explain myself in both my personal life and my role as opinion editor. As much as we need empathy now, we must also admit its mental and emotional tax and confront respectability politics’ role in upholding systems of oppression. 
For instance, I still find myself navigating new friends’ ideologies, which directly contradict my own at times. Consequently, I struggle coping with and relieving the cognitive dissonance. In such a polarized world, not everyone will align with my ideology, obviously. To what extent, however, can I separate someone else’s political framework from our companionship and distinguish the beliefs I can tolerate from the dealbreakers? 
If I do not address people when they deflect from the issue at hand, am I deflecting from my morals? If I do not double down on my beliefs nor press further in discourse, am I deflecting from myself? 
Despite my natural inclination to join discourse when I see it (see: The Eck’s Factor), a “reputation” era warrants vulnerability amid a world on fire. It allows us to give ourselves the slightest peace of mind when our efforts fail in a system designed to squash them. It allows us to mediate conflict when the world rallies against us. 
Although I am by no means a quintessential music icon nor voice of a generation, we can use this reflection as an opportunity to make sense of the deflections around us. And if we determine it just, we can deflect from our own moral compass’ direction. Nowadays, we can at least give ourselves that flexibility.

Camberley, England — roughly 30 miles southwest of London — is known for two things: the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Elmhurst Ballet School. A famous alumnus of the former includes James Bond series author, Ian Fleming. But it is the ballet school that produced Glorya Kaufman School of Dance’s artist-in-residence, Fiona Lummis Eddy.
Born and raised in Camberley, Lummis — following in her older sister’s footsteps — began ballet at age three. After decades as a student and company dancer, Lummis now shares her experience, repertoire and passion with students in Los Angeles. She credits much of her success to the ballet boarding school that just happened to be in the same military town as her family.
“It [the school’s dance genres were] a broad mix and the teachers choreographed on us,” Lummis said. “[Which] certainly kept my imagination alive.” 
Studying ballet, tap, flamenco and American jazz, to name a few, Lummis stayed at school learning, rehearsing and performing from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. The school’s emphasis on performance bled into all of its activities even at the school’s chapel, wgere Lummis said was even more associated with theater and performance than religion.
“[At high church,] we wore ballet shoes and veils, and we carried the incense,” Lummis said. “I thought it was wonderful.”
At 18, she was accepted into the Netherlands Dance Theatre’s secondary company, NDT 2. Its mission was to build up young dancers’ repertoire to feed them into their main company, NDT, a jump Lummis made in just two years. Featuring ballets by famous choreographers such as Jiri Kylian and William Forsythe, NDT focuses on contemporary dance. 
Kylian — NDT’s artistic director for 24 years — was Lummis’ favorite choreographer to work with, and she performed from 1981 to 2001 in more than 40 of his ballets. “There’s something about his work that really challenges you in every part of your brain, your body, your esthetic, and your involvement,” Lummis said. 
Kylian grew up in Czechoslovakia before the Communist Party fell. As a child, he was active in the vibrant theatre and dance scene, which is evident in his later work.
“It’s a lot of intellect that goes into what is done,” said Lummis’ former dance partner, Jean Emile. “He wanted to open up his oeuvre on us. We were going to help him grow, and in turn, he was going to help us.”
As NDT is based in The Hague, Lummis and Emile performed Kylian’s black-and-white ballets for diplomats and embassies. They even attended the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and performed as part of a cultural exchange that took place before the opening ceremonies.
“I remember seeing [Lummis] and thinking, ‘My God, what a beast.’ It was like watching Bette Davis,” Emile said. “I was always jealous when I saw her dance with somebody else … because I knew how she’s going to make them feel.”
In her 20 years at the company, Lummis rarely missed a show, something she credits to her training. Her husband, Glen Eddy, who Lummis met when dancing together at NDT, said her seemingly miraculous lack of injury comes from the way she takes care of herself.
“She just had a way of working within herself that was protected. But she gave so much too,” Eddy said. 
Lummis faced two injury-scares in her career. The first was a fall in The Hague, Netherlands from a scaffolded stage set on “Queens of Golub,” a ballet by the Israeli choreographer, Ohad Naharin. The set was about three stories high, and Lummis fell from the third to the second level. This potentially career-ending fall was broken by a ballet bar, and she came out uninjured.
The second scare occurred during a 1996 performance of Kylian’s “Sechs Tanze” in São Paulo, Brazil, where she was set down on the ground in a way that twisted her ankle and broke a bone. Lummis said she heard her foot crack, but adrenaline got her through the rest of the performance. After the show, she was taken to a hospital and sent to England for surgery, where she only underwent local anesthetic, so she could understand what doctors were doing to her foot. She spent six weeks healing.
By the end of her career, Lummis won two prestigious European dance awards. She received the Golden Theater prize in 1992 for her performance in Forsythe’s “Steptext.” She also won The Oeuvre prize in 2000 to recognize her long career in the Netherlands. She was pregnant with her first son at the time.
At 37, Lummis had her first child, Jack. She did one more year at NDT after his birth, but the long and hectic touring hours made it difficult to balance her priorities. Lummis retired and moved to South Pasadena, Calif., to live closer to her husband’s mother, Edith. Eddy then got a job at his alma mater, California Institute of the Arts. At 41, Fiona had her second son, Gus, at home. 
Lummis said these years marked the hardest period of her life. Her career changed from dancer to mother, and she found herself across the world without her community and network. 
That all changed in 2009, as a teacher at the Loa Angeles County High School of the Arts and later at Kaufman as an artist-in-residence.
At LACHSA, she teaches ballet and Kylian’s repertoire to help students prepare for dance conservatory auditions. One of her former students, Sophia Oddi, who majored in dance with a concentration in choreography, went on to train at USC Kaufman after working with Lummis.
“I don’t think I really understood how special it was to be able to have her teaching [Kylian’s] work,” Oddi said. “The language she uses and the attention to detail, and just seeing her do the repertoire and then trying to emulate it was special.”
Lummis now teaches classes and gives ballet lectures at Kaufman and was recently promoted to interim co-chair of the dance department at LACHSA.  
“She’s one of the funniest people when you really get to know her. She can make light of many situations and has this little sass to her,” Oddi said. “It translates into how she teaches her students.” 
Now 58, Lummis plans to continue teaching for the foreseeable future.
“I get complete joy from people and from this career and profession,” she said. “It’s really fed me.”

“Cowboy Bebop,” the 2021 live-action series reboot of the 1998 anime of the same name, chronicles the story of Spike Spiegel and his bounty-hunting adventures throughout space. Its validity as a reboot may be in question because of the omission of certain characters and storylines diverging throughout the show, developing earlier, later or differently than the 1998 version. Fortunately, much of the original story’s identity remains intact through tongue-in-cheek references and nearly-identical storylines. 
Unfortunately, this causes a recurring theme throughout the show. Whenever a scene from the original anime is recreated, it tends to be inferior in execution because of the live-action medium lacking the versatility of animation. Even then, the 2021 adaptation’s original banter and new scenes are great highlights that help expand on aspects the original show never touched on, such as how characters function outside their daily lives as well as their untold backstories. 
This paradox for a show hellbent on telling the original story in a new medium is accentuated by how incredible the show’s production value is. Whether it be the sets, clothing or cinematography, everything from a technical standpoint is pretty much unrivaled. I’d be hard-pressed to find another American-made adaptation that had the same level of polish. If I had to imagine a real-life version of these characters, these depictions are about as close as you could get. 
The cast bringing these characters to life is an energetic and well-put-together group. Spike Spiegel (John Cho) and Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir) — the characters with the most screen time together — are believable as both friends and co-workers trying to manage their own lives. Scenes depicting the uniqueness of their bond are done quite well as complements to the instances where the duo disagree and leave enough context for the viewer to understand their dynamic.
Other characters such as Faye Valentine (Daniella Pineda), Julia (Elena Satine) and Vicious (Alex Hassell) round out the main cast, interacting with our main two as unintended allies and occasional adversaries.
With writing being a consistent and endemic issue when it comes to recreating shows, “Cowboy Bebop” unfortunately falls into this tangled web. Although at times the series has moments that make you go “Huh, that was pretty alright,” the vast majority of it is either stiff in execution or lacks nuance.
For example, in the first episode, Spike and Jet are searching for a potential bounty in a place called New Tijuana after they busted an earlier bounty. Once they arrive, they find out there were actually two potential marks, as the woman he was traveling with was actually the daughter of a rich man who was attempting to escape. While this interaction was done quite well in the original, the show’s attempt to insert Faye Valentine earlier than the original does not mesh well.
Where the anime had scenes illustrating Spike’s character and his altruistic, selfless philosophy being buried beneath a snarky demeanor and bounty hunting, the live-action iteration removes those components in favor of antagonism between characters that have not been properly developed yet. 
With much of the show being a retread of the original, some scenes can feel awkward or misplaced, mostly because of the plot’s reorganization. This reorganization prevents the series from being an effective reflection of the anime’s self-contained plot points. While this occurrence does diminish the plot at times, it does result in some scenes that are actually narratively intriguing and shows the potential competency many want from a show like this.
Whether it be original content or rehashing, the fight choreography is one of “Cowboy Bebop’s” most important aspects. But to put it simply, the show does not meet the mark. Fights in the show are limited by the lack of long-shots displaying action and how bad the actual fighting is.
In the first episode, one of the bounties takes a drug that enhances their fighting ability so he can take on a group of henchmen trying to kill him. The fight begins with the perspective of the character having this red-eyed vision, which is unique and should have been kept as a consistent part. Instead, it switches between that point of view and the third person, diminishing the fight’s value, as the viewer has to jumble between different perspectives that don’t work in sync. 
All in all, “Cowboy Bebop” is not that bad for what it is. Most live-action anime shows are downright bad, removing so much from the show’s identity or lacking many of the nuances that helped create the show in the first place. The effort to make the show a worthwhile adaptation, even with its numerous faults, is visible and at times successful. Other times, it can be seen why live-action adaptations can be hit or miss. 
In my honest opinion, watch “Cowboy Bebop” if you want an ancillary piece to the original and compare how animes trump their live-action counterparts. If this is your first viewing of the franchise, however, it’s not the worst viewing you could see … but there’s already a better version out there from 23 years ago. 
See You, Space Cowboy.
