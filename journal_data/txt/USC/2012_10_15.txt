Journalist Frank Rich and author Fran Lebowitz pulled no punches Monday when it came to expressing their opinions of the current state of politics in the United States at an event in Bovard Auditorium. The two delivered strong comments about topics, including abortion, health care and Tuesday’s upcoming presidential debate.

The Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism and the Interfraternity Council sponsored “A State of the Union Conversation: An Evening with Frank Rich and Fran Lebowitz,” a Visions and Voices event.
The speakers’ strong opinions elicited responses from the audience, usually in the form of a rousing round of applause.
“I am hoping that unlike last time, I will not have the impulse to jump through the television set like I did last time and say to the president ‘Move over, I’ll do it,’” Lebowitz said. “These are not debates at all — they bare no resemblance to debates. It’s more a question of who’s going to win this boxing match.”
Lebowitz has written two books of essays, Metropolitan Life and Social Studies, that have been collected in the Fran Lebowitz Reader. She has been called forthright and unapologetically opinioned, as she is known for her strong statements.
Rich was equally opinionated, often guiding the conversation by asking Lebowitz questions of various themes. Another issue the pair brought up was the lack of intellectual discourse in modern politics.
“It seems when you watch a presidential debate, it seems more like a reality show where the issues don’t even register,” Rich said.
Lebowitz made a similar connection to the role reality television and politics play in society.
“Maybe the way that these two things could work together is that someone could convince the Kardashians to go to Afghanistan,” Lebowitz said. “We’d have A, the virtue of getting them out of this country and B, the millions of people who are watching the Kardashians would pay attentions to the wars.”
The audience reacted positively to the duo’s banter, laughing and clapping at all their jokes.
“They are both renowned authors and journalists who have a lot of knowledge on the current political issues that are very significant in this upcoming election,” IFC President Michael Madden said. “It’s important for students to care about politics because it’s important for everyone to be informed about current events and the current economic and political environment of our country.”
Omri Horowitz, IFC vice president of public relations, said the role young people play in society makes this event even more important.
“College students are trendsetters and have a high sphere of influence in today’s society,” Horowitz said. “With this territory comes the responsibility of being knowledgeable and up to date with global topics. Our own nation’s political state is key to our individual future success on an economic level, on a foreign relations level and in terms of social issues legislation.”

If an earthquake hit Los Angeles, how would the media cover it? That was the question that kept Gabriel Kahn up at night during his tenure as Los Angeles bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal.
“We had a lot of reporters … but access to information was a challenge. We didn’t want to have to wait two hours for the sheriff’s department to hold a press conference to get the details necessary to do our job,” Kahn said.
Then came the epiphany: Why not let citizens do the reporters’ jobs for them? As Kahn put it, “What we needed wasn’t more reporters … we just needed to turn regular citizens into reporters.”
The timing was perfect, as Kahn had just started working with the Annenberg Innovation Lab at USC. What resulted from the idea is Crisis Connection, a website and smart phone application that allows citizens and emergency responders to exchange vital information in the event of a disaster.
Kahn demonstrated the capabilities of the Crisis Connection website at the 2012 Innovation Summit, which was presented by the Annenberg Innovation Lab on March 30. During an emergency, a user can quickly upload a picture or video along with a brief description of his or her predicament. The person’s location is automatically pinpointed on a map using geolocation.
Users can also receive notifications of new posts and use this information to organize search parties, offer supplies or simply post their location and contact information should anyone request their help.
Though people already have a number of options if they want to offer or receive help during an emergency, Kahn believes Crisis Connection offers important services.
“911 is a great, fantastic tool, but it doesn’t work in a widespread disaster because if 500 people are calling 911 every minute, the dispatcher can’t handle that volume,” he said. “They don’t have resources to dispatch to everyone who’s calling.”
Unlike Twitter or Facebook, Crisis Connection is devoted solely to disaster and emergency situations, reducing the amount of information users have to sort through.
Crisis Connection is still a work in progress. Shangsong Ji, who worked on the Website Team until he graduated in 2012, said the app still needs several improvements.
The Homeland Security Advisory Council, which helps the Innovation Lab with fundraising, recently secured a $600,000 grant from the Ahmanson Foundation.
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated the grant from the Ahmanson Foundation was $60,000. The foundation gave $600,000.]
The money from the grant, which will be doled out over a two-year period, will give Kahn and his team the resources to proceed with “rigorous testing of the product in a real community like USC,” according to Kahn.
Though the team is currently using USC as a testing ground for the app, Kahn says the eventual target consumers will be “communities that face constant environmental threat,” citing particular neighborhoods along the Mississippi River that face periodic flooding.
The app does not yet have a formal release date yet, as the team has just begun discussions with the Dept. of Public Safety and other USC officials about how to incorporate the project into the USC community.
“We’ve got to make sure we’ve got a lot of things in place before we actually test it,” Kahn said.
The online version of Crisis Connection can be found at CrisisConnection.info/live.

Former presidential candidate and Green Party activist Ralph Nader spoke to a packed room of USC students and professors in Doheny Memorial Library on Monday afternoon, encouraging them to become more astute in the political and civic spheres.
Passion · Three-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader tells students to use their academic experience to advocate for change in a speech at Doheny Memorial Library on Monday. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
During his speech, titled “The Corporatization of Your Dreams,” Nader argued that the ideas students learn in college must be applied to civic engagement to make a difference in the current corporatized political structure.
“We all grow up corporate,” Nader said. “We all see just a tiny bit of reality, but if we grow up corporate we see even less of that reality.”
Nader believes corporations prevent citizens from accurately and fully analyzing the environmental and humanitarian issues and disparities plaguing our lives. To remedy this, Nader urges students to become engaged with civic involvement during college.
“The lesson of history is that it doesn’t matter what you know in your head if you don’t have the fire in your belly,” Nader said.
Nader stressed that without action, unchecked power of corporations and the government will not be corrected.
PolitiSCize, a new Program Board initiative to raise awareness of politics among students, brought Nader to campus to kick off its campaign.
The timing might have been fortuitous, as Nader has been traveling on a busy schedule: He flew directly from UC Berkeley, where he met with students, and will be speaking at Purdue University on Tuesday, according to Monica Parra, a Program Board member majoring in broadcast and digital journalism.
During a presidential election where young voters have faced criticism for lower enthusiasm,  Para said the group selected Nader because they hoped he could inspire students.
“We wanted students to be motivated and have students leave here with the motivation to learn more about politics and engage more and to look forward to the upcoming elections as an opportunity to get involved,” Parra said.
Nader believes that “half of democracy is showing up” and claimed that the main reasons citizens refrained from their democratic rights were because they thought that they lacked the time, understanding and concern to engage the political sphere. Some students related with his views on their civic responsibilities.
“We need to increase our civic power, so I’ll definitely be thinking about that and hopefully looking into getting involved in sorts of civic engagement,” said Matthew Eighmy, a freshman majoring in environmental studies. “But it’s hard because people are always saying they are going to do things and don’t end up doing them.”
Even students who did not necessarily agree with Nader still found it refreshing to have his perspective on the politics during the final crucial weeks of the presidential campaign — in a time when politicians largely speak to voters only along party lines.
“I did not agree with all of his points, [but] I definitely admire his ability to speak what he actually believes and not just cater to political lines or say things for political gain,” said David Tobia, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. “It’s good to hear someone who doesn’t have many reservations about their viewpoints and can speak from a humanitarian perspective.”
Nader left students with the insistence that college is the most important time for students to start believing in their civic responsibility.
“Now is the time to start asking these questions, because right now you’re as free as you’ll ever be to make your own decisions,” Nader said.
The PolitiSCize initiative’s next speaker will be New York Times journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner Nicholas Kristof, who will speak to students about human rights abuses and social injustice on Nov. 5.
Ralph Nader would be an excellent choice for students to support in helping organize a “People’s Convention” in the 2016 Presidential Election.
A “People’s Convention” could galvanize and organize hundreds, possibly thousands, of local grass roots organizations to Host a giant alternative convention to the Republican and Democrat Conventions in four years. It would take the full four years to get it properly and effectively organized.
Such a “People’s Convention” could bring to light many specific Human issues that need exposure. It could create a voting collaborative with enough votes to be a major power in the 2016 election.
I would like to hear from any student organizers willing to work for four years to put together such a convention.
I may be reached via the Contact portion of my website: http://www.howellhurst.com
As a former 40 year marketing consultant to small businesses and others, I believe I could be valuable in helping students design a media event that would capture the national and international press it would deserve, and potentially help break the strangle hold that the two American political parties have on U. S. Society.
If you would like to discuss this, contact me.
Perhaps we can plant a seed that would attract Nader and others to focus on this as one more necessary strategy to fight the continued corporate dominance of our once vital Democracy and its economy.
Folks, I am a 65 year old who has been supporting and following Ralph Nader for many years. How fortunate you are to have the opportunity to hear him speak. My 41 year old son calls him,”the old white-haired guy that always drives in the left-hand lane and refuses to move over.” How untrue! This man is literally the father of consumer activisim. People of my age recall how he bravely faced criticism and the “corporate rags” for his stance against the once rampant manufacturing of products that are unsafe for use by the general public (as in Ford Pintos with exploding gas tanks) and the blatant corporatism that allows this to happen even to this day. You will never find an advocate that is more dedicated to your safety as a consumer. Remember him!
Ken, Please note my comment, following yours. Would you care to discuss the idea I raise?

With the end of September, a slew of new TV shows have graced airwaves. With each network premiering a handful of programs this fall, it can be overwhelming to sift through all the new shows.

Luckily, here’s a compilation of the best new TV shows on the air this season. Save yourself from suffering through unwatchable pilots (The New Normal, Guys With Kids, Revolution) and check out the list below.
The Mindy Project
Anyone mildly familiar with Mindy Kaling’s work — whether it’s her best-selling book or her seven-year stint on The Office — knows how inherently likable she is. As a writer, she taps into universal topics, such as a love for cheesy romantic comedies, and makes them fresh with her sassy, unique voice.
Kaling’s character on the show, aptly named Mindy, is refreshingly and unabashedly offbeat. She spends her days looking for love in New York City, as in most rom-com television programs. In two episodes, we have already seen two men come and go from Mindy’s life (in the funniest ways possible, of course). But Mindy’s life is a work in progress.
Not straying too far from familiar tropes, the show clearly already has a built-in “will-they-won’t-they” couple with Mindy and her co-worker Danny, played by the always-charming Chris Messina. The two already have undeniable chemistry, although the show will surely put off getting them together for as long as possible so as to torture its viewers. Though the show still has room to find its stride completely, the first two episodes indicate that Kaling and team are off to an ever-promising start.
Nashville
Connie Britton. If you’ve ever seen Friday Night Lights, you should not need much more convincing beyond those two words. For those unfamiliar with Britton’s work, she is the main reason to tune into Nashville; she plays one of its captivating, strong and loveable leads. The show explores the world of country music through Rayna (Britton), a former country queen now struggling to sell records, and her competition with the hottest new pop-country crossover act, Juliette Barnes (played by Hayden Panettiere).
Nashville has all the makings of a great soap — sexual tension, workplace drama, catfights and a stunningly good-looking cast. If that’s not enough, the original songs are also catchy and authentic; some songs featured this season are written by members of Lady Antebellum.
The pilot’s only fundamental flaw is that it tries to accomplish too much and establishes too many characters. Once the show finds its groove and sticks to a tight group of main characters, however, it will be unstoppable. Nashville reminds viewers of Country Strong — if the protagonist was likable and had realistic problems. Tune in to Nashville for your weekly not-so-guilty pleasure.
Last Resort
At first glance, it might be easy to write off a submarine-based show. But if you have any respect for good television, Last Resort is worth a watch. The pilot will not only leave you crying and smiling simultaneously, but its dramatic, inspiring ending will also leave you craving more.
Last Resort also features impeccable writing, perfectly setting up the underwater world of the American submarine “Colorado” and immediately establishing well-defined characters. By dropping these strong characters into the high-stakes world of nuclear wars and corruption within American government, ABC has created what can easily be considered the best pilot of the fall TV lineup. The production value is also sky-high and it shows; the underwater visual effects are cutting-edge and the scenery of the French Polynesian island  setting is beautiful.
Go On
Though at first glance this new show featuring Matthew Perry might seem like a comedy, Go On explores a darker subject matter. Perry plays a sportscaster who, in the wake of his wife’s death, is commanded to join a support group by his boss in order to grieve properly. Though this show doesn’t unleash a torrent of jokes, it skillfully walks the fragile line between comedy and tragedy. And this unique combination is what gives Go On its heart and emotional foundation. The show embraces the fact that some of life’s greatest comedy emerges from tragedy and is not afraid to explore real, emotionally grounded moments.
That being said, this is a single camera sitcom, and the show maintains a great balance of comedy even within the context of a darker subject matter. Perry’s character even creates a tournament at his support group, making a competition of whose tragedy is the worst. Moments like these make Go On a fun watch. Combined with its built-in emotionally moving moments, the show is a highlight of the fall season.

Artist Mark Rothko might have wanted to leave the themes of his works up to interpretation, but the artist left little room for ambiguity in what he saw as the right and wrong places to display his art.
Back in 1958, Rothko received a commission for The Four Seasons, a restaurant that was opening inside the then-new Seagram building in Manhattan, N.Y.
But something about showcasing his artwork inside the restaurant rubbed Rothko the wrong way — namely the overt display of wealth within the restaurant, from patrons or otherwise. He saw it as the wrong place to display his art, and though he initially wanted to undermine diners’ experience by making the paintings hard to look at, he ultimately called off the commission altogether. He returned the money to Seagram, and today the nine works originally created for the restaurant now reside in London’s Tate Modern museum, the Kawamura Memorial Museum in Japan and National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
It’s the setting that Rothko would’ve preferred. Here, people come to view art, not to enjoy a bourgeois eating experience. Here, people speak of Rothko in the atmosphere of art scholarship and critique, not to boast to their co-workers about their expensive meal at a plush restaurant.
Yet even if Rothko’s works fits better in this atmosphere, that doesn’t shield it from all dangers. Though plenty of viewers visit the Tate to view the work from afar, one visitor got too close to “Black on Maroon.”
On Oct. 7, Vladimir Umanets, a leader of the “Yellowism” movement, added an inscription to the work, painting out his own name, the last two digits of the year and the phrase “a potential piece of Yellowism” on Rothko’s original painting. Though Umanets defends his actions, unless you are an equally famous art figure — and even so — the act of tampering with classic works of art does not go unpunished.
Though the art world fumes about the incident, Umanets has taken the opportunity to spread his ideas on art. The movement’s website, ThisIsYellowism.com. immediately gives Yellowism’s manifesto, a long-winded paragraph that starts with the statement, “Yellowism is not art or anti-art.”
The website shows a variety of images, a good amount of them disturbing, that allude in some way to Yellowism, an idea centered around expressing the color yellow. Among the many entangled ideas the movement presents are the thoughts that “examples of Yellowism can look like works of art but are not works of art,” and “Yellowism can be presented only in yellowistic chambers.”
Somehow, Umanets thought Rothko’s “Black on Maroon” would serve as the perfect way to explore the ideas of  Yellowism. Through his actions, it would seem that Umanets considers Rothko an artist who exemplifies Yellowism and doesn’t see his act as one of vandalism but as a way of changing perceptions about the artwork, something that might be hard to swallow for die-hard Rothko fans.
“Black on Maroon” shows characteristic Rothko tendencies — it’s large, presents the viewer with huge color fields and evokes feeling with its simple composition. This piece, in particular, stands on the more somber side of the artist’s works, the dark colors seeming to swallow the canvas whole, filling the viewer’s field of vision with near darkness. Though its creation dates back to 1958, it’s dark mood remains timeless. By standing in front of this Rothko, a viewer can sense the power of color and understand an artist’s ability to take a variety of approaches to creating his or her own aesthetically unique work.
Umanets is no Rothko. He’s not known for creating huge pieces of art and, if anything, most of the attention he has been receiving comes in the form of anger.
The journey of the Seagram-sponsored murals already possesses a rebellious spirit. The murals stayed in the museum gallery to avoid the turned-up noses of rich restaurant eaters. They did not need the wayward fervor of an artist unafraid of ruining a masterpiece for the viewing of everyone else. Rothko’s message feels contemporary without Umanets’ contribution.
If it’s truly a piece of Yellowism, then “Black on Maroon” should’ve remained unscrawled so it could exist as a pristine example of what Yellowism should look like. If Umanets revered the piece, it would follow that he would respect it accordingly. Under any art movement name, Rothko’s creations would look the same, and it’s ultimately no one’s right to take the liberty of changing its surface. Until Yellowism takes off into a full-fledged art movement with its own veritable artworks, it is best advised that it leave classic works of art alone.

Though audiences will find much to like about director James Ponsoldt’s newest film,  the biggest highlight might come as a surprise: the performance from Ponsoldt’s leading lady, Mary Elizabeth Winstead.
Intimate moment · Aaron Paul and Mary Elizabeth Winstead star as Charlie and Kate Hannah in James Ponsoldt’s drama, Smashed. – | Photo by Oana Marian, courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
Winstead shouldn’t be completely unknown to the mainstream viewer: She starred in smaller studio films like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.  But she is not, by any stretch of imagination, an A-list star; she has yet to break that barrier which separates fine performers from the industry’s elite.
However, following her brutal realistic performance in Smashed, one can predict that Winstead will quickly become a household name.
Smashed follows the story of Kate Hannah (Winstead), a young woman struggling to control her alcohol addiction and the devastating effects it has on her life. Kate works as an elementary school teacher, but when her excessive drinking begins to influence her classroom lessons, a colleague suggests seeking guidance.
Smashed chronicles Kate’s endeavor to purge herself of this habit — yet the themes of this film involve deeper concepts than the realities of alcoholism. Through this story and the powerful marriage of Kate and Charlie Hannah (Aaron Paul), writer-director Ponsoldt creates impactful statements on family, marriage and love.
The most praiseworthy aspect of the film is easily the performances. All of the actors, from leading stars to supporting players, infuse their roles with a dark, natural quality that makes the film feel hauntingly authentic. Though each character is portrayed effectively, Winstead, in particular, seizes the audience’s attention each moment she’s on screen. She plays Hannah so honestly, managing to capture the character’s subdued moments while still hitting Kate’s drunk beats with heightened hilarity.
With performance, it’s often extremely difficult to effectively balance shifts between comedic and dramatic moments. The changes in tone are so quick and immediate in Smashed that the performances of most other actors would only come off as comical, interrupting any emotional connection the audience might have had with the characters on screen. Winstead, however, seamlessly moves between emotions, causing the audience to laugh hysterically one minute and tear up the next.
The dynamic nuances of Winstead’s performance are further highlighted through the beautiful chemistry of her relationship with Paul. Every subtle detail of their marriage, including how the couple intently gazes into each other’s eyes, is absolutely brilliant. From the beginning to the end, audiences can honestly feel that these two characters are deeply in love with one another.
Ponsoldt contrasts this intense love with fervent conflict later in the story. Originally, Paul’s character, Charlie, disapproves of Kate’s attempt at sobriety. He sees no issue with her “supposed” alcohol obsession and enjoys how liquor alleviates his wife’s stresses. Based on this description, one would expect the audience to perceive Charlie as selfish and crude. However, Paul plays him with a kind of sympathetic charm that persuades the viewer to hope for the preservation of their marriage.
But although Charlie is initially opposed to the notion of Alcoholics Anonymous, he begins to warm up to the idea as he observes the destruction Kate inflicts on herself. Here, Paul’s easy, understated actions emphasize Kate’s gradual change.
The aesthetics of Smashed are quite effective as well. Produced with only $1 million budget, the film has a grainy and texturized cinematographic style, which extends the feel of dark realism. Gorgeously shot on film stock rather than a digital drive, the photography adds dramatic contrast and visual imagery to Winstead’s performance.
The narrative structure of the story forms the only portion of Ponsoldt’s drama that isn’t quite as solid as the rest of the movie. For the first two acts, the plot moves smoothly as Kate progresses through her character arc, which is ultimately constructed in anticipation of reaching sobriety. In the third act, however, Ponsoldt seems to skip over major plot points and scenes that would have injected more emotion into the film. Sporting a short run time of only 85 minutes, the film had room to include additional scenes.
Despite a short, unexplained resolution, Smashed is still a very emotional and powerful film that demands to be seen — even if only because of Winstead’s praiseworthy turn.

In 2008, Martin McDonagh made quite the entrance into feature film writing and directing with In Bruges, a crime story that followed two tourist hitmen and utilized an excellent mix of humor and drama. The film was well received: It earned three Golden Globe nominations — including a win for lead Colin Farrell — and an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Already an award winning filmmaker — following a previous win in the Oscar’s live action short category — McDonagh took more than four years to release his next movie, Seven Psychopaths.

Seven Psychopaths reunites McDonagh and Farrell and features an all-star cast of some of today’s most eccentric and versatile actors: The dark comedy puts talented performers such as Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken in high-profile roles: If someone were to fantasize a credits list for a film with “psychotic” undertones, this ensemble of professionals would easily come to mind.
McDonagh provides these actors with a hilariously twisted journey weaved around some incredibly distorted characters, creating a thoroughly enjoyable satire filled with ridiculous hilarity and exaggerated violence.
The plot of this horribly fun trip centers around Marty (Farrell), a struggling screenwriter attempting to develop his next feature film script,  titled “Seven Psychopaths.” Initially only able to formulate the title for his movie, Marty begins to interview real-life crazies to find structure and inspiration for his story. The conflict truly arises when Marty’s best friend, Billy (Rockwell), kidnaps a small shih-tzu with the assistance of his business partner Hans (Walken). Unfortunately for this strange trio, the little dog belongs to Charlie, a sensitive crime boss played by Harrelson. A tale of violence, madness and action ensues, all of which acts as inspiration for Marty and leads to the eventual completion of his script.
The concept of setting one’s main character as a screenwriter is often hopelessly overused in Hollywood.  But though Marty might appear to be a trite character wrapped in hackneyed traits, nothing about him or the arc he undergoes is ordinary. Rather than allowing the screenwriting occupation to form only a minor attribute of the story, McDonagh uses his protagonist’s writing as a vehicle for the plot’s movement and narrative architecture.
Marty and other characters imagine scenes in his fictional film that are then narrated by voiceover.
McDonagh then intriguingly pairs these audible passages with visual dream sequences that represent what the psychopaths are describing. In doing this, McDonagh begins to construct a highly complex narrative structure that constantly demands the audience’s attention, leading to great moments of heightened violence and laughter.
In some ways, Seven Psychopaths is an interesting use of a film within a film, with a collection of scenes from Marty’s new script incorporated into the story of Marty, Billy and Hans evading Charlie. By using this narrative trick, McDonagh achieves a “meta” state of artistic portrayal, through which the characters are self-aware of their ridiculous circumstances. It’s safe to say the use of this self-referential technique allows for huge laughs by way of each character’s incredibly maddening nuances.
The performances of Rockwell, Walken, Harrelson and several other “psychos” help make Seven Psychopaths an incredibly entertaining film from start to finish. Rockwell’s portrayal of Billy comes off as so weird, disturbing and downright silly that audiences can’t help bursting into laughter while watching him. Walken delivers some of his best acting in years while Harrelson remains invested in his character. Both names should be mentioned come this January for Golden Globe nominations.
Though the acting is genuinely great, McDonagh’s writing defines the success of Seven Psychopaths. The dialogue moves at just the right tempo to allow for almost perfectly timed laughter and riotous audience reaction. The tone of McDonagh’s script also remains especially strong. From the hilarious first scene, the audience is immediately informed of the film’s hyper-realistic nature that nearly becomes pure, absurd fantasy. McDonagh, however, never lets the film’s ridiculous nature overwhelm the more dramatic, emotional beats. He restrains from saturating the frame with comedy during certain sequences, enabling a truly touching conclusion.
But McDonagh stumbles in the pacing of the action and in transitioning between quick cuts and slower conversation. Analyzed independently, the individual scenes are very successful, but when strung together the instantaneous differences in mood can be quite exhausting. As a viewer, it’s frustrating to watch intense segments followed straightaway by less demanding scenes — gradual shifts might have been a more beneficial choice. Another fault in the film comes from the lack of developed female characters. Marty’s girlfriend, Kaya (Abbie Cornish), and Billy’s lover, Angela (Olga Kurylenko), appear in fewer than three scenes and aren’t truly effective.
But despite these few issues, Seven Psychopaths achieves a new cinematic level and an abundance of laughter few films dare to reach. Its hilarious characters, thought-provoking plot and comical violence all make it an excellent fall release.

USC mounted an early 10-0 lead at Washington last Saturday and prevailed to improve its overall record to 5-1 at the midway point of the season.
But as the Trojans trotted off a damp CenturyLink Field in Seattle, the overwhelming mood was that of frustration. They didn’t score enough — held without a point in the second half. They committed far too many penalties. And hey, what’s up with Matt Barkley?
Smell the roses · Former USC coach Pete Carroll always maintained that his main objective was to win Rose Bowls, not national titles. – Daily Trojan file photo
The tone from fans and others who follow the program suggested something went drastically wrong in the Emerald City, but no, no, the Trojans did pull off the win — their third straight.
“This isn’t about anybody’s numbers or Heisman or any of that,” USC coach Lane Kiffin reminded everyone during his post-game news conference. “This is about winning games.”
Sure it is. That, of course, is obvious.  But that’s hardly the whole picture.
Fans are growing increasingly frustrated each week — even with the winning, and, really, they deserve to be.
On one Rivals.com message board: “Does anyone truly think [Lane Kiffin] is a good play caller?”
Another added: “This is what I see: an offense that seems to try to move while the hand brake is on, and the hand on the hand brake is the coach.”
USC might still be going 60 miles per hour, but these Trojans were supposed to be cruising at 90, right?
In the months leading up to the season, we were told by Kiffin this team had the “perfect Trojan” in Barkley under center. This squad had the eventual “best ever” at wide receiver in sophomore Marqise Lee. This wasn’t endless media speculation; these definitive declarations came directly from the mouth of the coach, the head of the program.
Internally, the bar was set quite high. The athletic department launched a “We Play” campaign, intended to highlight a number of goals for the upcoming year such as playing for keeps, playing to dominate and playing to finish.
USC plopped a billboard with Barkley on it in Westwood, just a couple blocks from the campus of crosstown rival UCLA.
Most of all, USC talked about “unfinished business,” using the words uttered by the senior signal caller during his announcement to return to school as a catchphrase for T-shirts, wristbands and other merchandise — anything to make a buck.
As much as Kiffin, his coaching staff and his players have referenced “prep, not hype” — a slogan that has been painted on the sidelines at Howard Jones Field since spring practice — the hype around the program for the last 10 months has been unparalleled.
And for what? To sell a couple extra tickets?
Kiffin’s predecessor, Pete Carroll, who coached the Trojans from 2001-09, excelled in terms of channeling expectations. Even with people around Los Angeles and around the sport fixated on the Trojans, the internal goal always remained: to own the Rose Bowl.
Owning the Rose Bowl was twofold. It involved winning the conference title to earn a spot in the Rose Bowl Game on Jan. 1 and beating UCLA, which plays its home games in the Rose Bowl stadium. Both were clear and simple objectives, and USC exercised quite a bit of control in achieving them by just winning the contests on the schedule. In fact, Al Davis’ “just win, baby” mantra would have fit the program quite nicely.
Instead, USC, in 2012, watched the expectations grow like wildfire. And if anything, it just added fuel.
It scripted the narrative of finishing business, implying a grand finale in South Beach by securing a bid to the BCS national championship game at Sun Life Stadium near Miami. It talked about amassing style points.
“There is a showtime element,” Kiffin said about playing in Los Angeles on the eve of the season. “There is a style factor to it.”
The problem lies in that these standards hardly leave any room for error. Lose once and your national championship hopes suffer rather substantially. Lose again and they’re gone.
Win only by a touchdown or two and the reaction becomes: That’s all?
Playing for the BCS title game places a team at the mercy of pollsters and computer rankings — it has to pass the eye test or fit a mathematical formula just right. In playing for the Rose Bowl, it needs to be atop the Pac-12 standings. Subjectivity dictates the former. Wins and losses dictate the latter.
Of course, a national championship remains the foremost goal, but why add the extra attention? Why make it so obvious?
USC, at present, faces a situation in which it’s expected to win each week and win decisively, as if the team is part of some sort of beauty pageant.
Heightened expectations, of course, are a part of college football. Carroll’s teams still dealt with them. And any team ranked in the top 10 and any program carrying a pedigree similar to that of USC faces them. But those expectations are usually external. They come from boosters or commentators.
In this instance, comparatively, USC set the expectations: finishing its business. And darn it, it was going to look good doing so.
The problem is, right now, this team doesn’t look all that good. No wonder everyone around Los Angeles is so grumpy.

In Saturday’s 24-14 victory at Washington, No. 10 USC’s defense shined bright.
Though the offense struggled, the defense held strong and forced four Husky turnovers. Things could have gotten ugly, however, when junior cornerback Torin Harris went down with a reported concussion and did not return to the game.
More to come · In limited duty this season, Josh Shaw already has two interceptions — one against Hawai’i and the other at Washington. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The cornerback spot opposite junior Nickell Robey has been a question mark the entire season, and Harris’ injury didn’t help depth at the position. Moreover, freshman Kevon Seymour, who had been rotating the most with Harris, made the trip to Seattle, but did not suit up for unspecified reasons.
But the defense’s biggest — and perhaps only — question mark might have been resolved Saturday, as sophomore Josh Shaw stepped in and played admirably. Shaw, a transfer from Florida, had practiced at cornerback intermittently the week before but had not seen significant playing time on defense before the Washington game.
Shaw, who has mostly practiced at safety, drew the praise of coach Lane Kiffin for his performance against Washington.
“I thought Josh did good, really,” Kiffin said. “To go in that fast at corner … that wasn’t the plan. He got forced into there by people coming out.”
Shaw has had a bumpy road to USC. He began his career at Florida after a standout career at Palmdale High School in Palmdale, Calif. A high school All-American, rated a four-star prospect by Rivals.com, Shaw went to play for the Florida Gators but was injured early in his freshman season. He came back strong his next season on campus and had 22 tackles and played in 10 games.
Shaw decided to transfer to USC, however, to be closer to an ailing family member. And luckily for him, he was granted a hardship waiver by the NCAA, allowing him to play without sitting out a season, per normal transfer rules.
Despite his experience in the SEC, he was listed as a third-string safety on the depth chart in advance of USC’s game against Washington, mostly because of USC’s abundance of players at the position.
A permanent move to cornerback might allow him to see the field more often.
“I knew coming into this week I was going to end up having my opportunity to play,” Shaw said after the Washington game. “So I was just ready in all cases … whether I was going to go in at safety or corner. I came out here and I just wanted to help our team win.”
Compared to Harris, who was beaten for a touchdown earlier in the game, Shaw didn’t give up any points and went largely untested.
He even recorded an interception toward the end of the contest, catching a tipped pass when Washington quarterback Keith Price had the chance to narrow the Trojans’ 10-point gap.
“The guy dropped the ball and I just dove for it and made a play on it,” Shaw said.
Despite not playing significant minutes in any game up to this point, and mostly appearing on special teams, Shaw indicated that fatigue and rust did not affect him.
“It wasn’t really difficult,” Shaw explained. “I have great players on the side of the ball with me. I have T.J. [McDonald] back there, Jawanza [Starling], so they make it a lot easier for me.”
The defense was tested against Washington, as senior quarterback Matt Barkley and the offense failed to score any points in the second half. The Trojans were repeatedly tested in the passing game, but held strong due in large part to strong play from the secondary.
Harris’ status is unknown at this point, as USC’s injury policy prevents Kiffin from commenting on injuries.
Regardless, it is likely that Shaw will play a part in the Trojans’ defensive game plan the rest of the season because of his strong play Saturday, even though Kiffin, in Sunday’s conference call, would not fully commit to him as the starter in the spot going forward.
Perhaps more importantly, Shaw was pleased with his effort overall and praised the defense’s perseverance.
“What really happened was we bent but we didn’t break,” Shaw said. “Whenever that happens, I think that’s a win for us.”

The USC men’s basketball team took to the court for its first practice of the semester Friday at the Galen Center, featuring an overhauled roster that is a far cry from last season’s. USC coach Kevin O’Neill welcomed back just a handful of familiar faces for the Trojans, who added five transfers and three freshmen to a squad that finished a school worst 6-26 in 2011-12.
Sure thing · USC coach Kevin O’Neill says senior guard Jio Fontan is the only player locked into a starting role right now. Fontan is returning from a torn ACL he sustained in last year’s preseason exhibition trip to Brazil. – Daily Trojan file photo
“It’s a 360,” senior guard Jio Fontan said. “We’ve got so many guys compared to last year when we were searching for guys. We started two or three walk-ons at one time. This year, we’ve got 10 or 11 guys that can start on other teams. It’s a big difference and it gives us a lot of room to make changes, play different styles.”
The added depth means some tough decisions for O’Neill. The only starter set in stone is Fontan, who will likely assume the role of the go-to veteran for a team that only has one month to mesh together.
“Jio is going to lead this team,” O’Neill said. “He’s our best leader. The point guard on any basketball team needs to basically be the leader, unless you’re the leading scorer by a bunch.”
One of the few returning players, junior center Dewayne Dedmon, hopes to assist the newer members as they assimilate into their surroundings.
“I’ve already been around the block so I definitely feel a little bit more experienced than some of the new guys coming in,” Dedmon said, “so I can help them teach the plays and help them get used to KO’s offensive and defensive strategies.”
Dedmon is joined in the paint by two other seven-foot seniors: center James Blasczyk and junior center Omar Oraby. Oraby, a recent transfer from Rice, is a particularly interesting case: Standing at nearly 7-foot-3, he would make the Trojans taller and help improve rebounding.
Despite the additions of Oraby and others, it wasn’t exactly an ideal offseason for USC. The Trojans were dealt a blow in early September when junior guard and last year’s leading scorer Maurice Jones was ruled academically ineligible. He later decided to transfer rather than sit out a season.
“Mo leaving was tough on a personal level and a basketball level,” Fontan said. “That was my closest friend here, so I still speak to him every day, but we’ve got to move on as a team.”
To pick up the scoring load Jones leaves behind, USC will turn to former junior college guard J.T. Terrell, who played at Wake Forest two years ago as a freshman. Senior Renaldo Woolridge, a 6-foot-9 athletic forward who shot 37 percent on 3-pointers last season, transferred from Tennessee.
“I like all the new guys,” Fontan said. “J.T. [Terrell] is going to be really big-time. He has unbelievable one-on-one ability, I think he’s just starting to get accustomed to playing in a different style of basketball and having more weapons around him. Renaldo [Woolridge] was a great pickup for us, a guy who can shoot it. [Senior forward and UCI transfer] Eric Wise is an unbelievable player. Obviously Omar [Oraby] at 7-foot-3 has been able to do a lot of things that I don’t think we were expecting, especially this soon.”
As the new group of Trojans gears up for the regular-season opener on Nov. 9 against Coppin State, O’Neill will emphasize five basic principles.
“We’re trying to instill what our identity is, which is going to be great defense, rebounding the ball, low turnovers, great shots, and sharing the ball,” O’Neill said. “We have to establish a DNA of those five things.”
Fontan agrees with O’Neill’s goals for the team.
“We want to keep it as physical as possible up until the game times come,” Fontan said. “We just get that mentality to come out there and be more aggressive than other teams. We beat up on ourselves enough to where when the game starts we’ll be ready to beat up on somebody else.”
 
τ
 
For now, Oraby must wait to see if the NCAA will approve a hardship waiver which would allow him to play immediately instead of sitting out a season.
Regardless, that hasn’t stopped Dedmon from considering the possibilities for his own game with two other centers on board.
“It makes my job a lot easier to have two other seven-footers that are taller than me,” Dedmon said. “They can guard the bigger man.”
Though Oraby offers size, O’Neill mentioned that improving conditioning and learning the system are key areas of focus for the center, who averaged 6 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.6 blocks for Rice last season.
“We’re big — we’re an NBA-size team,” O’Neill added. “We pass the eye test. It’s just now getting everyone on the same page, playing the same way and doing the right thing.”
[…] the year due to academics, but the return of Jio Fontan from injury will help out the backcourt. The revamped roster will feature five transfers, all of whom can contribute immediately. J.T. Terrell (Peninsula College) and Ari Stewart (Wake […]

President Barack Obama’s performance in his first debate against Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was far from spirited, making the passion Obama expressed for American manufacturing stand out.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
In his proposed revamp of America’s corporate tax rate to improve the economy, Obama promised a big tax cut for American manufacturers, “taking it down to 25 percent.” This cut would be offset by closing tax loopholes across all other lines of business, with additional incentives to bring jobs overseas back home to America, according to The Kansas City Star.
Though generally more robust on tax cuts, Romney supports a similar tax proposal that also promises a 25 percent cut to American manufacturers across the board.
Throughout the presidential race, both Obama and Romney have held America’s declining manufacturing industry accountable for the country’s high unemployment rate and lethargic economic growth. But isolating corporate tax cuts around American manufacturing in an attempt to reinvigorate this dying industry is a colossal mistake.
Giving tax breaks to American manufacturers would be a foolish attempt to bring antiquated 20th-century solutions to a technologically proficient economy. Any candidate who proposes similar tax policies should especially raise concern among students, as they are the voters who have the most to gain or lose from the country’s financial future.
It’s no secret that American manufacturing is decreasing across almost every industry. In the past 20 years, 6.4 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. Today, there are fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in 1955. Outsourcing slashes corporations’ costs to the bone, allowing quantities to soar and prices to plummet. And new advances in technology allow these same benefits to be achieved on American soil.
Though politicians paint this trend as a tragic blow to the working class, the truth is quite the opposite. In fact, the gradual decline of American manufacturing greatly benefits our country — not simply by lowering the price of goods for consumers, but by eliminating subprime jobs from the market.
Contrary to popular belief, phasing out manufacturing jobs actually makes room for more advanced, robust industries offering higher-paying jobs for American workers.
Take the music industry, for example. Though record stores experienced a 76.3 percent decline in revenue from 2000-10, the music industry has far from faded. According to Strategy Analytics’ Global Recording Music forecast, worldwide digital music sales are slated to top $8.6 billion in 2012, the highest amount ever recorded. Overall digital music spending is projected to increase by 17.8 percent this year while packaged sales — mostly audio CDs — are expected to see a 12.1 percent decline.
As a result, new opportunities are flourishing in the digital sales world, event management, social media integration and marketing. And this trend is hardly limited to the music industry.
By 2020, there will be 123 million high-skill, high-paying jobs in this country — but only 50 million Americans with the qualifications to fill them, according to Edward Gordon, an author and former college professor with expertise in workforce issues. Any economic plan that attempts to artificially sustain dying, largely low-skill manufacturing jobs for adults while funneling students into the jobs of the future would be detrimental to society. But even though Trojans and other college students will be prepared for these positions, there will still be millions of jobs left unfilled, sure to result in a net decrease in our nation’s productivity.
Washington’s policies should prepare Americans — from students to adults — for these kinds of jobs, not spending money to sustain an industry that is slowly growing obsolete.
To do this, corporations should receive incentives for providing training for high-skill, high-paying jobs for Americans. Many states already provide monetary benefits to companies that hire American veterans or released convicts. Company- and government-provided resources to help train manufacturing workers for high-skill jobs should be a central point of the next president’s economic policy.
After all, the road to a more prosperous United States lies in technological innovation in fields like software, biotechnology and financial services — not in bringing poor manufacturing jobs back from China.
Companies should not be penalized for having efficient manufacturing procedures overseas. These jobs are not valuable to the American economy, and the government ought to acknowledge this reality.
Any politician’s inability to understand the road to American economic prosperity is troubling. In light of the impending financial future, it’s crucial for students to be clear on America’s manufacturing problems — or, more accurately, the lack thereof.

think of unemployment as an advance on your retirement
Ryan,
You should be commended. Your article is now making it’s rounds within the manufacturing community and you are quickly becoming the poster child example of where our educational system has dropped the ball as it relates to manufacturing.
Let’s start with something simple: Take a look at your surroundings right now. EVERY physical thing that you see is MADE. It’s produced by a company somewhere. In fact, take a look around while you’re working at Disney and note some of the engineering that’s there and how intricate some of those mechanical rides are built. 
There is a higher volume of sales in the total amount of physical product than there ever will be in “digital sales world, event management, social media integration and marketing” … What exactly do you think that the bulk of those sales, events and marketing efforts are selling?  Primarily something that is MADE.  You seem to be promoting a purely service economy which is detrimental to a strong National Security stance where we have the ability to produce things for the DOD.  If you do some modicum of research you will find that Admiral Yamamoto’s primary concern in attacking Pearl Harbor in 1941 was the industrial capacity of the US at the time.  Manufacturing capacity is a big part of our homeland security.
You state: “Today, there are fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in 1955” You are indeed correct. In 1955 there where 30 people standing in front of 30 Bridgeport knee mills producing one part at a time on each machine  per hour for a total of 30 parts/hour.  Today, we have one horizontal CNC (Computer Numerical Controlled) machine producing 30 parts in 30 minutes. These CNC machines require an understanding of Lean Process, computer programming, CAD, CAM, G-code and mechanical engineering to name but a few. None of this is  “low skill”. So the foundation of your statement “Any economic plan that attempts to artificially sustain dying, largely low-skill manufacturing jobs” is completely incorrect.  Our manufacturing industry in the US has the highest productivity rate in the world per unit of labor.  CNC machines can run 24/7 in ‘lights out” environments if the programmer and operator have the technical skill set to make it happen.  And ‘skills” are currently what manufacturing lacks…. but more about that later.
This is not to say that we haven’t probably (permanently) lost a large portion of highly labor intensive work. Several years ago I had the opportunity to listen to the Ambassador from India. He had a rather candid appraisal of the movement of business from country to country. He observed that the Textile industry had moved from England to New England and then to the US south. It was now moving to places like Thailand and VietNam and someday (soon) it would move to Africa because of the high labor requirement.  So, to paraphrase John McCain from several years ago “some jobs are not coming back.” So those kids shoe’s that you sold at Nordstom not so long ago will probably continue to be made off-shore unless a disruptive technology changes that labor requirement.
Perhaps you are not aware of the something called the ‘Reshoring Initiative” started by a gentleman named Harry Moser.  Harry has been talking about a concept called “Total Cost of Ownership” for some time and, within several industrial sectors, the TOC values are being considered and manufacturing jobs are indeed coming back the the US. You should ask about that in some of your Business classes.
You state: “Contrary to popular belief, phasing out manufacturing jobs actually makes room for more advanced, robust industries offering higher-paying jobs for American workers”  Back in 1998, I suppose your where about 8 or 9 years old at the time,  I was asked to do some research related to rapid prototyping for NASA.  I found a new technology that was called “Shape Deposition Manufacturing”  That technology is the foundation of what you may know as 3D printing and within the industrial sector is called “Additive Manufacturing”  I think, if you did a bit of research, into this particular field of manufacturing, you would find that you may wish to retract your ill informed statement.
You also stated “…for these kinds of jobs, not spending money to sustain an industry that is slowly growing obsolete” Really?   At what point, may I ask, will you not require “things” to be made?  Right now it is estimated that there are over 600,000 open jobs in the manufacturing sector that are unfilled.  A recent report out of Boston faults employers because the employers claim that the candidates don’t have the minimum skill sets required.  That’s not just high school grads  but college grads as well..
Here’s an example. Over 12 years ago I was at the Pacific Coast Machine Tool Expo in Santa Clara and I ran into a young engineer who’s designs I had been looking at over the past several months.  I congratulated him on his new job, to which he was surprised that I knew he was new.  He explained he had only graduated a few months prior from college. I explained to him that I started to see his name pop up quite bit, to which he proudly puffed out his chest. That is, until I told him that he was costing his company 10,000 of thousands of dollars.  You know when you screw a bolt in, that sometime the head of the bolt sits below the surface of the part?  That’s called a counterbored hole.  This young engineer had changed a part blueprint to require that several counterbored holes now had an 8 RMS finish around the wall that that bolt head nested.  What’s an RMS value like that? It’s almost a mirror finish. I asked him why he changed that as it had no affect on part performance and was purely a cosmetic issue that no one would ever see because the part was an internal component of a larger product.. He explained that he merely had to “click the mouse.”  I went on to explain to him that his mouse click took the cost of that hole from about a $1.50 drill that could produce 5,000 holes to a $350 tool that could only make about 700 holes and it increased the total cycle time to make the part.  He didn’t realize that he admitted. He had never seen a CNC machine in actual operation in school.  Therein lies the skills gap that the manufacturing community faces. in Germany, engineers such as this young man, are required to make parts for 2 years prior learning how to design anything.
Why do we need encourage manufacturing?  The short reason is that when you produce products you discover better and more efficient methods of producing products and then the technology transfers to other industries.  Several years ago I was visiting a company that made the sails for the America’s Cup boats. You may not realize it but the sails are quite a piece of engineering. How the strands of thread are laced together to provide more strength in some areas while keeping the overall weight low is critical to performance.  Making a big sail on a BIG jig and programming all of the CNC controlled sewing is rather complex.  The technology that developed out of that was so innovative that when Boeing needed to lay up carbon fiber stranding for the Dreamliner they came to this very same company.  Innovation begets innovation. So you see, your commentary “phasing out manufacturing jobs actually makes room for more advanced, robust industries” is very inaccurate: First hand experience over about 10,000 hours enables companies to become more proficient and able to think out of the box and innovate new process’
I hope you don’t take offense to my comments and I certainly hope you will take the opportunity to research some of the items I discussed here and perhaps view manufacturing in a different light in the future
Ryan, you’re the man. Please ignore this liberal drivel exhibited in the above posts. Mfg jobs ARE low pay, low skill and worthless in comparison to superior tech service jobs like those of Microsoft or Paypal. And for the record, it’s the business administration majors that distribute the loans to small businesses and take entrepreneurial risk in this nation. Mr. Townsend, the silent majority is behind you! Your opinion column is the only one in this paper I actually care to read
“it’s the business administration majors that distribute the loans to small businesses and take entrepreneurial risk in this nation.” that’s why a majority of business majors couldn’t run a lemonaide stand and turn a profit. I spoke to lots of people with business degrees from here and other schools. The ones who seem like they know how to run a business typically are taking over a family business, hence them seeming “like they know how to run a business.” Their families already set in motion a business, and all these people do is perpetuate what already works. How did the business education benefit that? 
Loan officers, bankers don’t need a formal business education per se. Many are trained OTJ. It’s a mechanical, repetitive, and cursory job that’s more contingent on cronyism and politics than smarts. It’s not brain surgery dude. 
And FYI, business degrees such as finance, accounting, HR, marketing, etc. were originally taught at LOWLY for-profit vocational schools e.g. Phoenix, ITT, Devry. G. Washington is correct that it’s an oversaturrated major hence its futility. It’s a shame that some 4-yr. accredited schools consider it a bona fide academic major…yeah right. 
Lastly, go talk to some Marshall alumni who are working minimum wage jobs even after earning 3.5+ GPAs, diligently networking, submitting resumes, etc. I’m sure they’re happy when the alumni center calls, asking them to drop $250 when they’re making 8$/hr scooping ice cream or tearing ticket stubs at movie theaters….And no, I ain’t scooping ice cream or tearing ticket stubs. I’m busting my ass in post-bacc. program because I should’ve had the gumption to pursue this originally instead of business.
Wow Ryan you are truly clueless.  YOu do realize the only reason we have stuff on the shelves is because we ar able to export our dollar to get it?? When the dollar stops being the world reserve currency and we can no longer export the dollar for all the products we are going to have MASSIVE price inflation and we will have empty shelves almost until we start our manufacturing.
Dear Ryan Townsend,
You’re an idiot.
Sincerely,
A Non-idiot Marshall Senior
So let me get this straight, you want to give up American manufacturing and the example you use is…the music industry?! And how many people can a country support with thriving music and financial services industries? Manufacturing jobs are not all low skill, low pay jobs. The perpetuation of this myth has decimated the American economy by funneling a whole generation of young people into the college system. This over saturation of people holding worthless degrees (i.e. Business Administration) and with no REAL skills has left the American manufacturing sector without enough skilled labor. The only reason we have the luxury of having a thriving music industry is because of our manufacturing base and deficit financing. Soon enough the music will stop though…

The federal government took unprecedented action last week against Mara Salvatrucha a brutal Latin American gang born three decades ago in Los Angeles. The government categorized MS-13 — as the group is known — as a “transnational criminal organization,” making it the first street gang added to this government list. This effort is the first step in a new war against gang violence, one that will move gang-infiltrated areas such as South Los Angeles forward toward becoming safer communities.
With this action, the U.S. Treasury Department requires U.S. financial institutions to identify any of the gang’s financial assets and report them to the Treasury Department, which can then freeze them. This is a move designed to reduce the flow of gang money in the United States and abroad to El Salvador — the suspected headquarters of the group’s leadership. From now on, it will be more difficult for the gang to use banks and wire transfers to move profits.
The Salvadoran community has responded negatively to the government’s labeling of MS-13, expressing concern over how this could tarnish the rest of Salvadorans in the United Sates that have worked to “escape the gang’s shadow.” Other concerns voiced include a federal crackdown handing down harsh, undue punishment to those with few connections to MS-13.
But the government’s policy comes at a crucial time, when MS-13’s numbers and reach are growing so much that local law enforcement is not equipped to address it. This offers much-needed forward movement in efforts to combat unorganized crime. Considering the violence of gangs in Los Angeles and across the nation, the designation by the federal government takes a crucial first step toward improving public safety.
Founded by Salvadoran refugees who fled to Los Angeles in the 1980s to escape civil war in their home country, MS-13’s roots trace back to large numbers of Salvadorans that congregated in the Pico-Union neighborhood and the MacArthur Park area. Unlike other typical L.A. street gangs, MS-13, as a Los Angeles Times article states, is “far more sophisticated.” Members have been convicted of crimes that range from assault, murder and conspiracy to kidnapping, human smuggling and drug trafficking.
Even with recent LAPD efforts to crack down on such gang-related crime, such as the creation of a special unit group whose only job is to investigate gang-related homicides in South Los Angeles, federal action was long overdue — not just in the form of additional units, but serious action to combat gangs at their source of survival and expansion: money. Local law enforcement has served as a traditional method of fighting gang violence, but with control over the financial underpinnings of gangs like MS-13, their eradication is much more possible and efficient.
Besides allowing U.S. financial organizations to identify and freeze any of the gang’s fiscal transactions, the new designation also highlights the transnational nature of Los Angeles.
It’s apt that MS-13 — a gang created by immigrants — was born in a city like Los Angeles. That characteristic continues today, and the gang mostly comprises illegal and second-generation immigrants: In 2008, the Washington Post reported that 90 percent of MS-13 members are illegal immigrants. MS-13 was born in Los Angeles but maintains deep roots overseas — similar to the many immigrant Los Angelenos who are concerned about what the new government policy could mean for them.
But ironically, the new policy is the one thing that can clear South Los Angeles and its residents from the shadow of the city’s notorious gang culture.
Almost a declaration of war, the federal designation sets South Los Angeles on its way to getting rid of its reputation as an unsafe area for residents and students to live.
Change is on the horizon. The federal authorities spent valuable time gathering enough information about MS-13 to know the identities of its leaders and operations to interfere with the gang’s profitability and proliferation. Now it’s time to put that information to work.

USC (5-1) sits at No. 10 in the initial BCS rankings released on Sunday. The Trojans are one of four Pac-12 teams represented, which also includes No. 3 Oregon (6-0), No. 8 Oregon State (5-0) and No. 20 Stanford (4-2).
Similar to last year’s rankings, the top two teams are from the SEC, with No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Florida on the inside track to the BCS National Championship Game. Oregon, No. 4 Kansas State and No. 5 Notre Dame round out the top 5.
LSU is the highest-ranked team with one loss, sitting at No. 6. Following LSU in the rankings is No. 7 South Carolina, Oregon State and No. 9 Oklahoma.
USC’s best chances to climb up the rankings are Nov. 3 against Oregon, Nov. 24 against Notre Dame and Nov. 30 at the Pac-12 Championship Game. 
The SEC is tied for the most teams ranked in the top 25 with seven represented, including No. 11 Georgia, No. 12 Mississippi State and No. 18 Texas A&M. The Big 12 also has seven teams ranked, including No. 13 West Virginia, No. 17 Texas Tech, No. 23 TCU, No. 24 Iowa State and No. 25 Texas.
Since the BCS was implemented in 1998, there have only been two occurrences in which the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the initial rankings failed to reach the title game.
