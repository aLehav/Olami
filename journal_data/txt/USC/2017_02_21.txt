Researchers at the USC Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute just bypassed a major roadblock in the development of a new kind of rechargeable battery — the lithium-sulfur.
Their findings, which were published in the January issue of the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, might lead to the introduction of the lithium-sulfur battery to markets as opposed to the industry standard lithium-ion battery.
Sri Narayan, the lead author of the study, has been studying batteries since graduate school, for 30 years now. However, he and his research assistant Derek Moy began working on this particular project five years ago with the goal of improving the life cycle of the lithium-sulfur battery.
“Lithium-sulfur batteries are the next step from lithium-ion in that you have about twice the energy density [than] the lithium ion or even more,” Narayan said. “Unfortunately, that technology has suffered many limitations because of the processes that happen inside the battery.”
The lithium-sulfur battery has many advantages over the lithium-ion, according to Narayan. The material it is composed of — sulfur — is common and affordable. These batteries are also smaller due to their great density, thus making them better at storing power and a worthy alternative to the larger lithium-ion batteries.
Despite these advantages, lithium-sulfur batteries are not usually seen in markets because their life cycles are inferior to those of the lithium-ions. Also, the lithium-ion batteries being sold today can be recharged as many as 1,000 times, the lithium-sulfur battery can only be recharged 50 to 100 times, making them unreliable alternatives despite their affordability and superior density.
“Lithium-sulfur can double the energy content of the lithium-ion battery in its current configuration,” Narayan said. “That means you get twice the run time, which also means that you have more energy at your disposal. But you also want cycle life. Lithium-sulfur offers you currently energy content, but does not offer you cycle life.”
However, Narayan and Moy have devised a solution to the lithium-sulfur battery’s limited life cycles — a thin, semi-permeable membrane they dubbed the “Mixed Conduction Membrane.” They placed this membrane between two porous separators, which were then placed between the two electrodes.
Narayan said that the idea for this membrane arose from the need to inhibit the movement of sulfur molecules and allow for the movement of lithium ions.
“The solution was actually in the lithium battery space,” Narayan said. “If you take the cathode materials, the positive electrode materials of the lithium ion battery, they have the ability to move around lithium ions, which we need to go between the two electrodes of the lithium-sulfur battery. But they will not let the sulfur molecules that are bad for the lithium-sulfur battery move.”
The purpose of this mixed conduction membrane is to halt polysulfide shuttling. In a normal lithium-sulfur battery, the shuttling of dissolved polysulfides between anode and cathode results in the cycle strain that has inhibited energy storage in lithium-sulfur batteries. Use of a mixed conduction membrane, on the other hand, still allows for the kind of flow of lithium ions seen in lithium-ion batteries, while harnessing all the advantages of the lithium-sulfur battery.
“The shuttling process causes some permanent changes at the other electrode when things go from one electrode to the other,” Narayan said. “The simple goal was: Can we stop this shuttling process? If we [do], then immediately we should be able to increase the life of this battery.”
Narayan and Moy found that lithium-sulfur batteries with the mixed conduction membrane had up to four times longer life compared to batteries without the membrane. This led them to believe that, once a few other issues involving the lithium electrode are fixed, this battery may possibly make its way into the market in a few years.
“The way we stopped the shuttling process is just one of the solutions,” Moy said. “People can now focus on the negative electrode, which is the next big step. If they can stabilize the negative electrode, which is the lithium electrode, then we could very well be seeing lithium-sulfur batteries on the market.”
Narayan and Moy are continuing their work with lithium-sulfur batteries, looking to study the electrodes further and make improvements to their mixed conduction membrane.

President C. L. Max Nikias recently concluded a week of outreach in Taiwan, which culminated in a reception hosted by USC on Monday that included close to 400 alumni and individuals from the local community.
The aim of Nikias’ visit was to strengthen ties with the country and connect Trojans, supporters and prospective students, according to USC News.
During the visit, USC delegates and Nikias met with Pan Chyr-Yang, the National Taiwan University President; Chen Chien-jen, the vice president of Taiwan, and other government, industry and academic partners. 
The meetings touched on points of intersection between USC and Taiwan, as well as the importance of receiving a college degree from a professional school such as USC.
In an interview with The China Post, Nikias emphasized the importance of a continued relationship with Pacific Rim nations such as Taiwan.
“As president, I see Taiwan as a strategic priority for our international outreach for the University, given the very strong ties that exist between USC and Taiwan in the past 60 to 65 years,” Nikias said. “We honestly want USC to become the intellectual and cultural engine of the Pacific Rim nations and of course the United States. We have many things going for us to have that impact in the 21st century.”
USC is the sixth most diverse university in the United States, according to a ranking of 100 schools by Priceonomics. Out of the 10,569 international students currently enrolled, 368 students are from Taiwan, and Taiwanese students make up the University’s fourth-largest source of international students.
Nikias said he hopes to bring more Taiwanese students to Los Angeles and believes that the increased collaboration will be mutually beneficial. 
“USC is committed to supporting scholarly talent across the globe, and Taiwan has long been a source of outstanding students and research partnerships for our University,” Nikias said. “I am confident that this delegation will help strengthen USC’s engagement with Taiwanese institutions and open new opportunities for collaboration.”

Photo from USC Dornsife websiteHelping hand · Natalie Reyes, a senior majoring in sociology and law, history, and culture helps lead the Virtual Food Pantry.
Though most USC students take full advantage of meal plans and on-campus dining options, some face a daily struggle to put food on the table. In an effort to combat food insecurity at USC, the Dornsife College Office of Diversity and Strategic Initiatives partnered with Campus Activities to support these students through the Virtual Food Pantry. 
Food insecurity can occur for a variety of reasons, but the high cost of living in Los Angeles can make it particularly difficult for low-income USC students. The Pantry provides $25 Ralph’s gift cards for students to use at their own discretion, offers services to help students with budgeting tools and connects them with financial aid representatives. 
Mary Ho, the assistant vice dean of Diversity and Strategic Initiatives, said the team behind the Virtual Food Pantry collects data on students to understand how food insecurity negatively affects them. 
“We have seen the impact,” Ho said. “The students who have come to me have expressed gratitude. So we better understand that this does impact them negatively when they don’t have food.” 
The Food Pantry initiative began with a donation from Leo and Dorothy Braudy, who worked with Dornsife Diversity Director George Sanchez to help underprivileged students.
Kelly Sanchez, a senior majoring in NGOs and social change, helps to run the pantry. She said that the pantry “makes USC more of a home,” providing a sense of security that some students might not be experiencing in their own homes.
“It’s hard enough being a college student in the first place —managing finances, managing life and also trying to decide who you are trying to be,” Sanchez said. “For someone that really just has a blank slate, food insecurity is a very common problem.” 
Savannah Robinson, who serves as the social media coordinator for the project, added that food insecurity is “more widespread than we think.” 
“One of my close friends is someone who is extremely money conscious. She was so excited when she heard about this food pantry,” Robinson said. 
Natalie Reyes, a senior majoring in sociology and law, history and culture, personally dealt with food insecurity during her sophomore year of college. Now in a different financial position and as one of the leading members of this initiative, she is able to use her own experience to help in the effort. 
“I knew all of my friends were struggling, and it was just something we knew that was going on but we didn’t know there was someone we could talk to for help,” Reyes said.

Warren Poh | Daily TrojanRocket man · Neil Tewksbury, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, works on the nose cone of a rocket at the Viterbi lab.
The Rocket Propulsion Laboratory of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering allows students of all experience levels to participate in design teams where they complete projects for competitions.
Their ultimate goal, though, is to create the first university-built rocket to go to space.
Each year, the team aims to make improvements on their rocket from previous years to increase its distance and height. 
“Our goal, to be the first university to go to space, is an ambitious goal. It’s a feat that takes faithful people,” Chief Composite Engineer Roberto Lopez said, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The kind of people rocket lab attracts are internally motivated and excited about going to space.”
Members of RPL can work with a number of sub-teams that specialize in order to work more efficiently. Chief Propulsion Engineer Damian Balla co-heads the propulsion team, whose main function is to design and build motors. Members in that sub-team focus on improving the motors to gain more altitude by collecting data on the performance of the propellant.
Over the remaining semester, Balla and his team will find ways to improve the propellant. 
“We have several performance improvements to make to the propellant, which include making denser propellant that burns longer and has a different ‘thrust profile’ which allows us to gain massive amounts of performance,” Balla said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Last semester, RPL came in with the goal of testing their newest rocket, Fathom II, on the ground and in the air successfully in September. The plan proved too ambitious when the front end of the rocket burned through during static firing. 
“This made us push back our launch date until we had a working case design,” Lopez said. “After redesigning, we came back a month later only to have the same thing happen on the aft end of the vehicle.”
While the first two tests were demoralized, Balla said that they were able to make progress with new member training and building hardware. Despite these setbacks, the team was able to regroup by November and attempt a third test. This time, the case they tested did not burn through. 
“With this new qualified design, we have built another case and attached fins to it getting ready for our much deserved flight March 4,” Lopez said.
Balla said that the ability for RPL to press on in spite of hardships is emblematic of USC. 
“The ‘Fight On’ motto is extremely important for us because after all, it is rocket science, and it’s extremely difficult,” Balla said. “Because we continue to make improvements and iterate our designs at a rapid pace, we are able to truly ‘Fight On’ and achieve amazing things.”
Lopez also believes it is the Trojan spirit that makes it possible for RPL to continue to make progress. 
“RPL produces engineers that are skillful and ambitious like Trojans. At RPL, we like to do things ourselves,” Lopez said. “We are more than just designers. We are builders. We machine all the metallic components on our manual mill and lathes. From this attitude, we gain valuable hands-on skills that help us design better components.”

A USC sophomore has started a petition calling upon the University to establish an Africana studies major and employ a black professor in the history department.
Austin Rogers, a sophomore majoring in history, is asking students to support an increase in black professors and Ph.D. students, as well as the implementation of more courses teaching the history of African-Americans, Africans and post-colonial independence. 
Right now the history department only has two black professors, Francille Wilson and Diana Williams, who are both leaving the University in May. In addition, there have only been two black Ph.D. history students to attend USC since the University’s founding 137 years ago.
Rogers included those points on the petition after speaking with USC Diversity Director George Sanchez. 
“That was a really telling data point,” Rogers said. 
Rogers said he began to think about the issue about a year ago, after noticing that there are no classes in the history department dealing with the continent of Africa. He was also inspired after reading texts by Malcolm X on Afro-American history. 
“There’s this narrative that black culture begins with captivity,” Rogers said. “The goal of the petition is to challenge those assumptions and get more representation on campus.”
Ogechi Ibeanusi, a senior majoring in English and history, helped Rogers organize the petition. Ibeanusi shared the petition as a Google form in multiple Facebook groups, including USC Black Class and Black Campus Minustries, last Wednesday. Rogers and Ibeanusi also posted the petition on their personal Facebook pages. 
“It got a really big response from people,” Rogers said. “I’m really grateful that there are people — allies — who aren’t even black who recognize the importance of learning about your shared history and ancestry and what that means for self-empowerment. I think that people just see that, and it’s almost common sense to be disappointed that the University doesn’t offer that.”
Razzan Nakhlawi, a junior majoring in journalism, was one of the supporters who signed the petition and also shared it on Facebook. 
“I do think that … especially in terms of history and history departments at universities, having a decolonized and non-Eurocentric aspect of your education is really important,” Nakhlawi said. “I was really glad to see Austin making concrete change toward that.”
Rogers noted that the University’s historical lack of involvement in these issues can be discouraging to students who want to learn more. 
“There is a precedent for the exclusion of these kind of studies,” Rogers said. “I mean like the petition said, it’s been 137 years, and there hasn’t really been a lot of traction. We’re facing a big, big obstacle.”
However, Rogers remains hopeful that there is a chance that actions such as his can change this exclusion.
“I’m optimistic that we can keep advocating and rallying people together and organizing,” Rogers said. “We’re not just helping black students but improving the University’s overall environment.”

Sorry, Paulina. I know I got this to you a good week after you wanted it. But as I’m sure you know and have seen, being a journalist never stops. So, as I sit in my dark dorm room at 2 a.m. after a long edit session with my lamp light illuminating the keyboard and Mac Miller bumping through my headphones, I figured I should probably explain my job (because yes, Sonali, I actually get work done sometimes).
To be completely honest though, sometimes I have no idea what I’m doing or what to do. In fact, that’s why I’ve been putting off this piece. Being one of the more junior members on the staff, I have some very big shoes to fill. I look at other editors like Danni Wang, our editor-in-chief, or Diana Kruzman, our associate managing editor, who have years of experience ensuring Daily Trojan is available every day, and I ask myself if I will ever have the chance or even simply the stamina to reach that level.
What I do know is that we are a family. Since I am a freshman, I had very few people I knew going into school. I understood getting involved would introduce me to awesome friends, but I had no idea it would be like this. I don’t have to worry about not knowing anyone on campus outside of my dorm, nor do I have to wonder how I’ll be spending my night (the answer is in the newsroom). There’s nothing more I could want.
And of course, being one of the younger editors comes with many advantages. I have the opportunity to make some real, lasting change in the newsroom and institute policies in the photo department that will hopefully last beyond my years at ’SC. Here, people are open to change. Trying new things isn’t anything weird or different. I love it when photographers ask me to pick up extra assignments, when I see the graphics and photos coming together beautifully, or even when I pick up a well composed photo story.
As for now, anything you think being an editor means, is not it at all. Half the time it’s me sitting frantically at a desk typing emails, requesting photos, or harassing my photographers (so if you’re reading this — turn in your photos). Very rarely does my job involve the glamour that comes to mind when I think of photojournalist. And even then, I have to make sure that all my staffers are good before me. With all the protests lately, I want to make sure I’m out there if I can, but also that all my photographers are out there being careful as well. Although the only time they might see me is spamming their Facebook and Gmail, I care about each of them as much as anyone else.
However, I did not realize the incredible experiences I’ve had with DT. Whether it be shooting Drake, PARTYNEXTDOOR and G-Eazy for free, sitting on the sidelines at the Rose Bowl or having a portrait session with President C. L. Max Nikias, my colleagues — my fellow editors — my friends — will always be there to support me. There’s nothing more I could ask. Peace and love.

Situated in the hipster promise land of Silver Lake, Dinosaur Coffee invites coffee drinkers to stop in for a casual atmosphere with satisfying beverages. The surrounding neighborhood, comprised primarily of trendy millennials, also offers a variety of unique small businesses. Dinosaur Coffee is among one of these independent businesses, which serves as a meeting place for friends. 
Whether for a well-deserved break or to finish some work, Dinosaur Coffee provides a welcoming environment. Background music plays above a whisper as baristas race back and forth to fulfill orders. One customer scoffed at the lack of WiFi. However, I relished the opportunity to feel present in my surroundings. As opposed to constantly checking notifications, I appreciated the simplistic space trimmed with wood paneling, third time in a coffee house, and succulents galore. Relying on Yelp suggestions, I ordered an almond milk latte, hot chocolate and sweet baby Jo, the specialty drink. Energetically awaiting three caffeinated beverages, I fulfilled my inner-Lorelai Gilmore dream.
Photo from Yelp
The almond milk latte sadly fell short. Purely aesthetically speaking, I would rate this beverage a 10/10. However, the almond milk seemed to leave a strange aftertaste, which discouraged my dairy sensitivity needs. 
The speciality drink, sweet baby Jo, triumphed over any preconceived notions. The espresso shot and condensed milk sang a duet of creamy perfection. This drink is ideal for coffee drinkers that do not care for a bitter aftertaste.
Photo from Yelp
The delightfully warm hot chocolate had an especially soothing effect on a chilly, overcast day. The chocolate’s subtle flavor profile floated in a pool of milky goodness. 
Dinosaur Coffee is known for its lightly roasted Four Barrel beans from San Francisco. The smooth and rich taste is proof of the high quality bean.
As I continue to explore coffee houses, I have identified the universality of these spaces. These places provide a warm respite from cumbersome obligations, which plague us all.
May the parking gods smile upon you, the next time you choose to embark on a journey to Dinosaur Coffee.

USC baseball opened its season with a three-game sweep of Coppin State this weekend, as the Trojans beat the Eagles 22-2, 6-2 and 9-4. They then followed up the sweep with an extra-innings victory over Long Beach State on Tuesday.
Due to the rain on Friday, the season opener was pushed to a doubleheader on Saturday afternoon. The Trojan bats were hot from the beginning, scoring three runs in the first inning of game one and 12 runs in the second inning. Redshirt senior left fielder David Edson hit his first collegiate home run in the third inning, a two-run shot, in addition to two singles and a double. 
In game one, all the starters had at least one hit, finishing with a total of 20 at the end of the game. Coppin State pulled starting pitcher Jacob Lewis with no outs in the second inning having surrendered eight runs, four hits, three walks and a hit batter. 
Trojan starter junior Mitch Hart (1-0) opened the game with five no-hit innings and finished six shutout frames in his first start of the season, giving up only one hit and striking out a
career-high nine batters. He was relieved by freshman Connor Lunn, who pitched the final three innings in his collegiate debut. 
The Trojans kept mostly the same lineup for game two on Saturday, only swapping sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy for senior catcher Cris Perez. 
“I think a lot of the guys earned the opportunity [to play both games],” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “I mean, we scored 22 runs in the first game. We got them out early enough and got them rested, so it wasn’t like they played 18 innings.”
Junior Brad Wegman started the second game of the
doubleheader and went six innings, giving up only one run and striking out five. 
Again, the Trojans jumped ahead early, taking a 1-0 lead in the first and building on it in the second, fourth and sixth innings to win the game 6-2. Sophomore outfielder Lars Nootbaar and Perez each had two runs batted in. 
Game three began with a little less certainty than the previous two. The Trojans came to the plate down 2-0 in the first inning after a rather shaky opening frame from sophomore Marrick Crouse. 
“I thought Marrick really settled in after the first couple hitters,” Hubbs said. “Other than the solo homer [in the fourth], I don’t know if he gave up another hit. I thought he did a great job, specifically in those last five innings. He pounded the strike zone and didn’t give much opportunity to get on base.”
Crouse recorded a quality start, giving up three runs on four hits in six innings of work with three strikeouts. 
Coppin State started the game off strong with two base hits and a stolen base. The scoring spree, however, was derailed when Corey Treyes was hit by a pitch but was not awarded first base because he did not make an attempt to get out of the way. Coppin State head coach Sherman Reed was tossed from the game for arguing on behalf of Treyes. 
After Reed exited, Coppin State went quietly, with only Jamar Criss adding to the Eagles’ tally with a fourth-inning solo shot and an RBI single in the eighth. 
For the Trojans, the offense was dormant until the fourth inning. Freshman right fielder Brady Shockey put USC on the board after walking, advancing on a balk, then an error and finally stealing home. 
The Trojans scored again in the fifth after a walk from Edson and a double from junior third baseman Adalberto Carrillo. Then the real scoring started in the sixth. 
Senior AJ Fritts led off with a double and scored on Perez’s single. Freshman infielder John Thomas singled Perez in and Nootbaar drove in Thomas and Edson with a three-run homer over the right-center field fence. Nootbaar had two singles to accompany his home run. 
“Lars is a really good hitter,” Hubbs said. “He’s hitting third for a reason, and he’s really matured over the last year. We expect him to have a big year.”
Next up for USC are professional Korean outfit NC Dinos, who shut out the Trojans 5-0 in an exhibition game last year. The Dinos will visit Dedeaux Field once again on Wednesday night, with first pitch scheduled for 6:30 p.m.

We were sitting in the downtown Las Vegas Krispy Kreme when my friend Maddie received the unfortunate news via text alert on her phone.
“Not Boogie!” 
The yelp of desperation came as somewhat to a surprise to me. Maddie is a sports fan, but she exists at a different intensity of emotion when it comes to her teams, unless the Trojans are trailing 49-35 with nine minutes remaining in the Rose Bowl.
But when she heard the Sacramento Kings were trading DeMarcus Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans, she got as close to tears as I’d ever seen her. Even though Maddie is a casual fan, the news was a shock because Cousins, at his core, was a staple of Sacramento. Maddie owned his jersey, and even if she didn’t always watch the team’s games, his seven-year run with the Kings was a part of her identity as a Sacramento native.
Cousins himself was tearful as he discussed the trade, barely choking out his speech and addressing Sacramento as a whole — “My love for this city has never changed.”
The moment captured a theme that is tied tightly to the overall emotion of sports — loyalty and the way that a loyalty to one team and its players knits a whole city together. Cousins received a loving goodbye from his city, which seemed heartbroken at the loss of “Boogie,” their first-round power forward who came to the team as a scrappy kid with only one season at Kentucky under his belt. And Cousins, for his part, gave that love right back to the city in which he became an NBA star.
When it comes to sports, I put a lot of stock into loyalty. I hate college one-and-dones and bandwagon fans. As a Royals fan, I’ve come to love the players who started out in our farm teams and grew up to become our headliner stars. As a University of Kansas fan, I root every week for a pair of senior point guards who started out as nobody transfers and became the best backcourt in the nation.
But the lines of loyalty often blur when I look at professional sports.
I remember, of course, the explosion that followed Kevin Durant’s announcement that he would leave Oklahoma City to join the Warriors this season. The rage of Thunder fans has simmered somewhat, but many still describe the move in the same way — betrayal.
That’s a strong word, and at first, I had to agree. Mainly, I was annoyed that Durant was adding yet another piece to the Evil Empire of the Warriors. But there was also something frustratingly disloyal in the act of jumping ship after a team drops the ball in the playoffs, and it was that apparent lack of faith in his team that made me question Durant’s actions so greatly.
It would seem, after all, that loyalty to a program makes both the player and the team stronger. Take a look at this year’s Super Bowl champions, for instance. Tom Brady has served as the quarterback, figurehead and demi-god of the New England Patriots for 17 years.
If that’s not loyalty, I don’t know what is. And look how it’s paid off — in the process, the team has clinched the second-most Super Bowl rings in the nation, trailing the Pittsburgh Steelers by only one championship. If you’re trying to sell the idea that loyal players are the best type of players, then the Patriots would be the poster child.
But no matter how personal and emotional they are, sports at their core are businesses. And when baffling trades and transitions occur, it’s important for fans to remember that. 
Cousins, for instance, isn’t leaving of his own accord — his trade was made to better a Kings franchise that is sputtering to a halt at ninth in the Western Conference. The move was a business transaction, and it brought in a payload for the Kings, who received Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway and two draft picks.
It’s not a matter of his disloyalty to his own program or the Kings’ disloyalty to a long time player. But when teams go stagnant and begin to struggle, it’s an integral role of those at the top of the food chain to pump new life into their franchise.
In the same way, players need that mobility to stay fresh and remain in team situations that allow them to play to the fullest of their abilities. Despite LeBron’s jersey-burning days when he left Cleveland for Miami, the time he spent playing — and winning — with the Heat fueled his ability to return to the Cavs to bring the championship home. The same can be said for Peyton Manning, who found the storybook ending to his career only after leaving the Indianapolis Colts.
Fans will always miss the players who leave, and that’s understandable. They are, after all, the humans who make us fall in love with the sport and the team to begin with. 
But remember that when one player leaves, another comes to fill their shoes. After watching Buddy Hield in the Big 12 last year, I know what he’s capable of doing in Sacramento. The same can be said for Evans and Galloway, and the two unknown draft picks leave a lot of wiggle room for a Sacramento team that definitely needs it.
So yes, it’s easy to hate on Durant for leaving or on Sacramento for not fighting for Cousins to stay. And it’s hard to see these types of trades and transitions occur without feeling that there’s something inherently bad or evil or just plain wrong about them, but that’s just a part of the game.
At the end of the day, no matter how hard it is to lose a star player, Sacramento should know — if this trade works out the way it’s supposed to, I think you’ll get by just fine without Boogie.

On Saturday, No. 4 USC women’s lacrosse (2-0) posted its second victory of the season — the first against a ranked opponent — with an 11-10 overtime triumph over No. 9 Northwestern (2-2). The win improves the Trojans to 2-3 in their all-time series against the Wildcats. The victory, capped off by freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller’s game-winning goal in overtime to complete her first career hat trick, was USC’s second in two seasons against Northwestern.
The Women of Troy faced numerous issues against the Wildcats, including adverse weather conditions that caused the game to be moved from McAlister Field to nearby El Camino Community College. The rainstorms, coupled with a solid Northwestern defensive effort, caused the Trojans numerous ball handling issues. USC turned it over 20 times, including seven failed clearances.
The Wildcats also outshot USC and outdueled the Women of Troy on the draw by a 16-7 count (13-4 in the first half). Despite this, USC went into halftime with a 9-7 lead. However, Northwestern outscored the Trojans in the second half by a score of 3-1 to force overtime.
In overtime, the Wildcats’ formidable defense continued to frustrate the Trojans, forcing turnovers that led to a pair of scoring opportunities for Northwestern. Both times, junior goalie Gussie Johns was there to deny the Wildcats on her way to a 17-save effort, the second-most in USC single-game history. Johns also picked up eight ground balls to tie a program record and tie the
third-highest single-game total in MPSF history.
In addition to Johns, junior Lydia Sutton and senior Nina Kelty posted solid defensive efforts, combining for eight ground balls and five caused turnovers. Kelty secured one of USC’s seven draw controls, while Miller also added a draw control, three caused turnovers and a pair of ground balls to go with her hat trick. Ultimately, the Trojans’ solid defensive play in the ground ball game (29 to Northwestern’s 23) was enough to overcome their turnover struggles.
Offensively, senior midfielder Drew Jackson led the team in goals, scoring her third career hat trick and finishing with four points (one assist). Jackson also contributed a pair of ground balls and a caused turnover. Senior attacker Kylie Drexel scored two goals and recorded an assist, while senior attackers Gabby McMahon and Cynthia Del Core each scored a goal apiece and combined for three ground balls. Senior attacker Michaela Michael, the Trojan’s primary faceoff specialist, came away with four draw controls in addition to a ground ball, a caused turnover, an assist and a score in a well-rounded effort.
Coming off this quality win, USC heads to the state of Florida for games at No. 3 Florida and at Stetson. The Trojans will play the Gators for the first time on Friday in Gainesville, Fla. at 3:30 p.m., hoping to post another victory against a ranked team. The Trojans defeated Stetson at home last season, and they will face the Hatters again on Sunday at 9 a.m. in DeLand, Fla.

After upsetting two top 10 teams last week, the men’s volleyball team looks to feed off its first back-to-back victories of 2017 and defeat No. 11 Cal State Northridge and No. 2 Long Beach State on the road this week. The newly ranked No. 14 Trojans hope to take certain elements from both wins and duplicate them to continue their winning streak.
“Well, the winning would be great to replicate,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “Our guys kept composure and kept challenging, which is one of the things I would love to move forward.”
USC’s youth played a role in its early-season struggles. Having a young team can be difficult when going up against teams with four or five returning starters, but it was in the last two games that younger members like sophomore middle blocker Ryan Moss and sophomore outside hitter Woody Cook started to put up big numbers. With these players continuing to improve, the Trojans will look to continue contending against top-ranked teams.
“It’s not like saying, ‘You can’t do this’ or ‘You don’t know how to do this,’” Nygaard said. “It is more of that they need to embody this and gain experience and apply these types of skills in real situations so that they just get more comfort and proficiency with them.”
For all players, the best — and most obvious — way to increase confidence is by getting a win, and the Trojans had two last week. While they are not going to face these teams over-confidently, they will go in more sure of their system and their ability to produce wins over top teams.
“It validates what we are doing,” Nygaard said. “Things that we get really good at at practice have to translate to how we perform on the court when the lights are on.”
Even with this newfound confidence, neither of these matches is going to be easy for USC. Both teams boast strength, precision and consistency. The Trojans fell in three sets to Northridge in their last meeting, and with Long Beach State, USC is looking to repeat its victory from the two teams’ last meeting and hand the 49ers their second loss in conference play.
“One of the challenges that Northridge brings is that they are a physical team,” Nygaard said. “If you allow them to get loose with their physicality, it is hard to bring them back down and control them.
“Long Beach … was a top three team last year and they are basically the same team [this year]. They know how to play together. They are a strong volleyball team. They don’t have many weaknesses.”
The Trojans will look to extend their upset-winning streak against two more favored opponents this week, with Cal State Northridge first up. First serve is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Matadome on Wednesday. Long Beach State comes next, with that match set to start at 7 p.m. on Friday at the Walter Pyramid.

In their first and only homestand this month, women’s basketball produced two close contests, defeating Washington State 80-64 before losing to No. 9 Washington in a game that was tighter than the final score indicated. 
“I feel like we had a little rough start,” freshman guard Minyon Moore said. “But the fact that we’ve bounced back shows a lot about our team and about our heart. If we take it one game at a time and go out and have the same mentality we’ve had the last couple of games, then we can finish the season on a strong note.” 
When USC played Washington State in Pullman, Wash. back in January, the team had yet to figure out its shooting struggles. The team finished 36.2 percent from the field and went 3-of-13 from three in a 74-57 loss. But on Friday, the Trojans flipped the script thanks to the play of Moore and a barrage of 3-pointers. Moore finished with a career-high 32 points and the team shot 50 percent from long range. 
“I think 3-pointers were the difference in the game,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “I just thought we attacked more on offense, which then created the space and time for us to make the extra pass and come away with wide open 3-point shots.” 
USC carried its 3-point momentum into an intense Senior Day shootout with 24-4 Washington on Sunday. The Trojans looked undaunted having defeated a top 10 giant in Oregon State just last week. At one point they drained four shots in a row from deep, in a first quarter that resembled a Western movie shootout. Sophomore guard Aliyah Mazyck and senior guard Courtney Jaco combined for 14 points in the explosive first frame. 
Down 26-22, Washington guard Kelsey Plum decided it was time to showcase why she is one of the best players in women’s college basketball history. In the second quarter, she alone outscored the Trojans 20-9 making buckets from outside, inside and everywhere in between. Before the Song Girls could perform at halftime, she already had 27 points, a 9-point lead for her team, and the second-most points in NCAA history, passing Britney Griner. 
“I thought we made it tough for Kelsey all game long,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We doubled her when we could, and when it made sense, and we had a player constantly shadowing her. We had a couple of defensive letdowns and of course Kelsey being Kelsey, she took full advantage of them. She’s just a fantastic player.” 
Having somewhat weathered the Plum storm, USC went back to work in the second half, relying on Moore just as they had on Friday. In the third quarter, she recorded 14 points with deep shooting, aggressive
and-ones and plenty of free throws. Moore capped it all off with a buzzer-beating three that cut Washington’s lead to seven points. Suddenly, the Trojans were right back in the game. 
Unfortunately for USC, the team was unable to produce enough stops in the fourth quarter. The Trojans fought back to within 10 points on several occasions but big shots by Plum and center Chantel Osahor helped the Huskies keep their opposition at arm’s length. In the end, valiant performances by junior forward Kristen Simon (17 points and 13 rebounds), Moore (20 points) and Mazyck (15 points despite being on minutes restriction), were not enough to slay the giant. Washington won
87-74 in an intense game, made even more emotional by it being the seniors’ last contest in the Galen Center. 
“I try not to think about it too much,” said Jaco, who has the second most 3-pointers in USC history. “It is a little bittersweet, it being my last time in the locker room getting ready for a game, putting on my jersey and seeing my family and friends out there supporting me. I thought I gave it all I had today, and I thought my team did as well. I think that was the most important part, that we grew today.” 
In honor of redshirt senior guard Jordan Adams, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear in November, Simon wore the jersey No. 1 instead of her usual 35. 
“It was a late decision,” Simon said. “I was just thinking about it, just being able to give something to Jordan. She’s a great person, she’s a great player, and I love her to death. I was just trying to give her something to smile about, just to see her number out there on the court and being able to play in her jersey made me feel good, made me feel like a leader, made me feel like Jordan.” 
The Trojans now stand at 14-13. They have two games remaining against Arizona and Arizona State before the Pac-12 Tournament begins.

“I thought we made it tough for Kelsey all game long,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We doubled her when we could, and when it made sense, and we had a player constantly shadowing her. We had a couple of defensive letdowns and of course Kelsey being Kelsey, she took full advantage of them. She’s just a fantastic player.” 
Having somewhat weathered the Plum storm, USC went back to work in the second half, relying on Moore just as they had on Friday. In the third quarter, she recorded 14 points with deep shooting, aggressive
and-ones and plenty of free throws. Moore capped it all off with a buzzer-beating three that cut Washington’s lead to seven points. Suddenly, the Trojans were right back in the game. 
Unfortunately for USC, the team was unable to produce enough stops in the fourth quarter. The Trojans fought back to within 10 points on several occasions but big shots by Plum and center Chantel Osahor helped the Huskies keep their opposition at arm’s length. In the end, valiant performances by junior forward Kristen Simon (17 points and 13 rebounds), Moore (20 points) and Mazyck (15 points despite being on minutes restriction), were not enough to slay the giant. Washington won
87-74 in an intense game, made even more emotional by it being the seniors’ last contest in the Galen Center. 
“I try not to think about it too much,” said Jaco, who has the second most 3-pointers in USC history. “It is a little bittersweet, it being my last time in the locker room getting ready for a game, putting on my jersey and seeing my family and friends out there supporting me. I thought I gave it all I had today, and I thought my team did as well. I think that was the most important part, that we grew today.” 
In honor of redshirt senior guard Jordan Adams, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear in November, Simon wore the jersey No. 1 instead of her usual 35. 
“It was a late decision,” Simon said. “I was just thinking about it, just being able to give something to Jordan. She’s a great person, she’s a great player, and I love her to death. I was just trying to give her something to smile about, just to see her number out there on the court and being able to play in her jersey made me feel good, made me feel like a leader, made me feel like Jordan.” 
The Trojans now stand at 14-13. They have two games remaining against Arizona and Arizona State before the Pac-12 Tournament begins.

“With liberty and justice for all.”
George Takei remembered repeating this phrase from the Pledge of Allegiance, like many Americans, since he was just a schoolboy. His experience with liberty and justice, however, was markedly different than the average American.
“I could see the barbed wire next to the center tower, right outside my schoolhouse perimeter, as I recited the words, ‘With liberty and justice for all,’” Takei said at a press conference on Friday.
Takei was one of the 120,000 Japanese Americans forcibly interned within segregated camps under President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s executive order issued in 1942.
Seventy-five years later, Takei is now a renowned actor, social activist and chair emeritus of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. On Friday, he introduced the opening of its latest exhibition, Instructions to all Persons: Reflections on Executive Order 9066.
The exhibition has been in the works for many years and aims to commemorate the incarceration of Japanese Americans seven decades ago, but according to curator Clement Hanami, its sociopolitical significance draws parallels with the current political climate.
The historic documents of Presidential Proclamation 2537 — Roosevelt’s executive order and legislative precursor to the order — was funded by the Broad Foundation. The Foundation sponsored the transportation of the papers from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.
“We cannot forget the immoral injustice executive orders can inflict,” the Broad Foundation President Gerun Riley said.
The two pieces are on display at the heart of the exhibit, past narrow, dark corridors. There, Roosevelt’s typed order hangs, magnified and heavy with historical consequence, above a glass case of the original signed documents.
Gentle music beckons the viewer inside the dimmed setting of the exhibit’s walkway to a small theater that replays the internment testimonials of many Japanese Americans. Their voices resonate beyond the dark, secluded space, perceptible even deeper inside. Although the testimonies soon fade off into the distance, a black-and-white wall filled with Kodak photographs of Japanese testifiers visually amplifies their harsh reality, even without sound present.
“Have you been told your story is not important?” is written in thin orange text, interrupting the rows of Kodaks with its bold statement. Another installation is displayed parallel to it, but with the words, “What is your story?” written in between the images.
The main room of the exhibit contains hundreds of historical leaflets, newspaper clippings, books and documents scattered in glass cases with wooden lining. The wood and the yellowed pages of documents give the room a warm glow, but upon closer inspection, the significance of the displayed pieces is haunting.
“INSTRUCTIONS TO ALL PERSONS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY.” The bold statement was issued as a direct command; on the exhibit’s center wall hang the framings of multiple civilian rules and exclusion orders that hindered Japanese Americans’ rights and eventually led to their internment. The legislative orders patched up the entire surface of the wall, with key orders enlarged and held in restrictive wooden frames.
“At that time, [Japanese Americans] were all classified as enemy aliens,” said Bill Shishima, a USC alumnus who lived at the Santa Anita camp as an 11-year-old. “I was a young American citizen, but no — where the government was concerned, I was an enemy alien. This exhibit spells out all the details, all the executive orders that pertain to that [belief].” 
A powerful visual timeline extends alongside the walls adjacent to the center installation, illustrating the progression of discriminatory legislation enacted during the early 1940s. The horizontal sequencing of the timeline invited viewers to walk through this path of history, outlined with significant quotes from Japanese Americans, contentious court cases and internment locations throughout the years.
At the end of the timeline, the viewer is confronted with three hanging sculptures — a loosely hung mass consisting of hundreds of paper tags that were once issued to detained Japanese individuals. The sculptures rustled in the air-conditioned breeze inside the museum, but otherwise, they appeared lifelessly wrinkled and melancholy — left-behind memories no one wanted to reclaim.
Though somber in mood, the final installation of Instructions to All Persons casts a hopeful light on the progressive ideologies held by Americans today. It is a video that features a diverse group of young Americans reading letters written by children in internment camps to the outside world.
It is a touching video that preaches unity through a simple concept — having children today read the letters of children from the past and realize that they share more than they differ.
Richard Murakami, a USC alumnus whose childhood was largely affected by Executive Order 9066, reflected on the importance of understanding and empathy from the public to prevent these American tragedies.
“We believe in this exhibit because it tells the public about what happened 75 years ago,” Murakami said. “The reason why we have this museum … is because we don’t want this to happen again.”
Instructions to All Persons will be open at the Japanese American National Museum from Feb. 18 to Aug. 13. The original Executive Order 9066 with Roosevelt’s signature will be on display through May 21.

Tucked in a corner of Little Tokyo, JiST Cafe may be small in size, but it’s bustling with character and flavor.
Located on Judge John Aiso Street at the border of the Tokyo Historical District and the Civic Center, the cafe’s location reflects the intersectionality of Japanese and American culture. Surrounded by the Japanese American National Museum and other restaurants, JiST Cafe is immersed in the same history that shaped it.
Tokyo Cafe, JiST’s forerunner, was opened in 1940 by co-founder Glen Ishii’s grandmother. Almost immediately after opening the cafe, she was sent to a Japanese internment camp, a reality that many people in the community faced during the period.
“When [Ishii’s grandmother] came back, she still had this hunger for the American Dream, so she reopened Tokyo Cafe,” co-founder Caroline Shin said.
Tokyo Cafe then became an icon of Little Tokyo, a community staple for families in the area. The cafe was passed on from Ishii’s grandmother to his father to his uncle. Eventually, it was Ishii’s turn.
Ishii and Shin both have years of culinary experience, having worked at L.A. restaurants, Ishii was the executive chef at the Noe Restaurant, where he and Shin met. Shin was also the co-founder of the wildly popular Kogi Korean Barbecue truck and taqueria. When the opportunity to take over Tokyo Cafe fell into Ishii’s hands, it felt like natural next steps for both chefs.
Ishii grew up in Little Tokyo, soaking up the culinary and cultural traditions deeply rooted in the historic neighborhood.
“Little Tokyo has changed a lot over the generations and the years, and it’s really interesting walking down the streets with Chef Glenn, who grew up here, hearing about the people and community,” Shin said. “Knowing the history and keeping this tradition of what was passed down to him is important for this restaurant.” 
The menu reflects the intersection of Japanese and American that Ishii and Little Tokyo both represent. Dishes like the porky omurice and the katsu sandwich place an Asian twist on American food. A wide array of delicious pancakes appease the tastebuds of those who hunt for traditional brunch dishes.
 The highlight of the menu is the chashu hash skillet, a sweet pork belly and potato hash cooked with a tangy marinade, topped with two hard-boiled eggs. With every bite, the sweet and salty flavor of the sauce erupts. The pork, braised and marinated perfectly, complemented the sauce and potatoes. The eggs, cooked over-easy, run into the mix of ingredients. The different textures, perfectly cooked in “family history,” as the menu describes, create a dish nothing less than divine.
 “The most popular dish on the menu for Tokyo Cafe was the chashu shu mai that everybody came in for. It’s really fun seeing 80- year-old people coming in asking for it — people who grew up eating it,” Shin said. “I wanted to save that, elevate it and make it our signature item, which is where the Chashu Hash came from.” 
Sunday marked the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 7066, which sent 120,000 Americans into internment camps across the country. On the anniversary of this tragedy, Little Tokyo stood in remembrance and strength — reflecting on the injustice that plagued their community.
 “There’s a sense of pride in Little Tokyo, especially all the older families,” Shin said. “They think, ‘We’ve been through this as well, we know what it’s like, and we still survived.’ There were plenty of people who were unable to have that success, and they feel lucky in that way.” 
At a time when celebration of diversity is at a crossroads, restaurants like JiST Cafe encourage Americans to embrace all aspects of their identity. Food is one of the most effective ways to unite, and restaurants that are rooted in history and represent American values, like JiST, have an incredibly important role to play in this fight.
 “The feeling you’d get when you walked in [to Tokyo Cafe], where they welcomed everybody and made you feel like you were a part of their family — it’s something that we continually do,” Shin said. “We’re paying homage to what made Tokyo Cafe so special at the time: It’s our way of keeping a little bit of that tradition alive.”

Lon Kurashige pivots his computer’s aux monitor and points to a spreadsheet of public opinion polls from mid-December of 1941 — just weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In high school, students are often taught Japanese internment was a direct response to Pearl Harbor. But these polls suggest a more complicated picture.
Asked whether there were “very many or only a few aliens around here who are not loyal to the U.S.,” 73 percent of the respondents of the National Opinion Research Center’s survey said no. And of those who said there were enemy sympathizers living in the United States, the majority said it was Germans or Italians who were spies — not the Japanese.
And yet, only the Japanese were interned. Why? Kurashige, a professor of history and spatial sciences, is working on unraveling the complicated attitudes Americans held toward Japanese immigrants and ethnics in the early 1940s. Kurashige suggested that the conventional historical understanding of internment lacks sophistication. 
According to Kurashige, it was partly a matter of pragmatics. Japanese Americans constituted a smaller population than German or Italian Americans; it was not politically costly to lose the Japanese vote. Furthermore, Japanese Americans were concentrated on the West Coast and lived in segregated communities, so it was possible to round them up, Kurashige argued. 
Anti-Japanese hysteria was a factor, too, but it didn’t kick in directly after Pearl Harbor. Instead, Kurashige said, it was in the weeks after Pearl Harbor, when Japan began to lay waste to European and American colonial possessions.
“What happens between Pearl Harbor — Dec. 7 — and late January is the Japanese do their own Blitzkrieg, all throughout Asia,” Kurashige said. “On the same day as they’re attacking Pearl Harbor, they’re attacking Hong Kong. They take the Philippines — something from the Americans. So, Japan is very successful in a very short period.” 
While racism had framed the Japanese as powerless toadies before, these military victories demanded American attention. Americans began to apply a term to Japanese Americans that had previously been widely used to describe communist and Nazi sympathizers: “The fifth column.” 
“The fifth column were traitors, were spies — espionage. That was a big concern throughout the ‘30s, throughout the world, of fifth columnists,” Kurashige said. “They would apply it to anybody who was seen as suspicious; we would call them terrorists today, or traitors or spies.”
By late January, popular support for internment had completely flipped. Most Americans were anti-Japanese. And the bus rides began.
Kurashige’s research suggests in any political climate, the perfect storm can convert seemingly benign forms of racism into plainly unjust policies — like internment. Throughout the interview, Kurashige hinted at parallels between the social atmospheres of the early 1940s and today: deep-seated fears of espionage fed growing opposition to immigration. And that opposition persisted when the FBI and other intelligence agencies advised FDR that internment was unnecessary. 
But Kurashige maintains there are some important differences in political leadership that we must take into account before claiming that today’s political trends forecast a second interment on the horizon.
Take the America First movement — a popular isolationist movement to keep the United States out of World War II. 
“FDR’s countering against that, trying to get America into the war, for its own benefit. And FDR has a reputation for being inclusive and creating a ‘new deal’ for everybody,” Kurashige said. “I think that’s very different from Trump trying to have this exclusive sense that this is America only, not for immigrants, not for a certain population. What’s parallel is not necessarily the men, but the times.”
It’s that latter parallel that motivates Kurashige to conduct research on Japanese internment today. While he doesn’t feel that historians should be beholden to specific political views, he said the privilege of academic freedom inclines him to study material that’s relevant to modern concerns.
“There’s certainly an independence to the role of the scholar that I take very seriously,” Kurashige said. “I see the role of the scholar as kind of like the role of the artist, and that’s to innovate and to create, and see things differently in ways that are meaningful.”
Davao city in the Philippines had the highest concentration of Japanese immigrants (over 30k people) anywhere in the world in 1941. They had lived in the  Philippines for many generations. When Japan invaded the Philippines immediately after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese in Davao City not only turned on their Filipino neighbors and aided in the Japanese invasion, it was discovered that many of the Japanese merchants who had lived in Davao City were actually Japanese military who had worked undercover for years prior to the invasion. Over 1 million Filipinos dies in the invasion and aftermath. Look it up.

I am not of Japanese descent, nor do I have any personal ties to anyone incarcerated in the Japanese American internment camps during World War II. However, it would be a lie to count myself as disassociated with this horror when the concepts of alienation and racism are not foreign to me; when politics guided by fear once again grip our country; and when the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066 retreated so silently into our past.
If I told you that last Sunday marked the 75th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s signing of an order to incarcerate 120,000 Japanese Americans, would you be surprised? Probably. But that’s not your fault — I don’t remember seeing more than a few articles posted on social media or a Twitter hashtag buried under at least seven others trending. For anyone or anything else — a person, a marriage, a death — 75 is a landmark year, but apparently not so much for Japanese American internment. 
How is history supposed to be accessible when those who remember it feel so inclined to forget and distance past crimes? The headlines I encountered even labeled the events “Japanese internment,” as if those forced out of their homes were not everyday Americans who farmed and made lives on Western soil.
But this fate of silently fading into history is not tolerated by Allegiance, a Broadway musical about internment by actor George Takei. I was lucky enough to attend a screened version of the performance at L.A. Live last Sunday in a crowd of young and old Japanese Americans. Fierce and pointed and heartbreaking, what the musical lacks in artistic subtlety it makes up for in brazen spirit — a fist thrust in the air proclaiming that the horrifying practice of internment and alienation will not be forgotten. 
Allegiance is, unshockingly, a musical about loyalty — but it’s not the same kind Roosevelt thought he was enforcing when he signed Executive Order 9066. No, there’s no need to test a person’s allegiance to the United States when they have always been American. Instead, the musical asks: Where do you turn to when your own country dismantles its allegiance to you? And what happens to your family when everyone turns in different ways? What happens to you? 
Sammy (Telly Leung) and Kei (Lea Salonga) are siblings whose lives are torn apart when they, their father and their grandfather (George Takei) are sent to Wyoming’s Heart Mountain camp to live out the remainder of the war. At Heart Mountain, the family encounters heartbreak and are drawn out to their rawest, angriest selves, but they also discover perseverance and hope. 
Kei finds love in a rebel named Frankie (Michael K. Lee) and Sammy finds love in a white nurse, Hannah (Katie Rose Clark). Yet, 50 years later when the musical begins, Sammy (now played by George Takei) is an old man living alone, receiving word that Kei passed away after half a century without contact from her brother. 
How did he get here?
The musical, which closes out at a relatively short two hours, hits its emotional beats at a rhythm almost too fast and too easily. The songs are soaring but they don’t grab your heart; the performances and vocals are rich and heartfelt but feel almost too grand for the musical’s small frame. Overall, Allegiance is a contained story with a sprawling agenda — and sometimes the musical takes shortcuts that don’t feel real. 
And yet, I am a firm believer that works should be judged twofold — first by their artistic merit and then by the way they shape the conversations around them. Perhaps no piece of modern theater tests this more than Allegiance, which is not only artistically imperfect but also very necessary. 
The musical may be too obvious, too loud, too unsubtle in emotional depth. But how else, then, can someone tell a story about Japanese American internment? How else do you make people talk and remember if you’re not shouting into their faces?
Allegiance was a quilt woven of many threads, but one of the strongest themes dealt with shame: the idea that if hope can move mountains, then shame can keep those mountains in place. There is Americans’ modern shame about Japanese American internment, but one that is also nothing compared to the hurt and grief embedded within communities told, 75 years ago and today, that they are not of this country, that they do not belong, that their identity is erasable and -— moreover — not their own. Sammy took that shame and fought for his country until he earned the Purple Heart, left his family, didn’t talk about the internment camps and what happened there for 50 years. 
If you have not stood in shoes like that, how are you to gauge the horrors by which crimes like Executive Order 9066 continue to this day? How are you to know what it’s like to come to this country for the freedom and safety it holds out, to invest in the American promise only to be told that the promise is not for you? Because of the color of your skin. Because of where you and your ancestors are from. Because of the God to whom you pray.
You can’t. You must believe. You must listen to these stories and believe them. Because empathy is a force more powerful than hate, one that is forged only when we listen, and one that will not withstand the test of time. Forcing the gap between two people doesn’t make a person stronger — between Sammy and Kei, sometimes it comes too late. Forgetting the past only makes the past come back once more.

Like many students, I had a fairly sleepy high school experience. My school day ran from 7:35 a.m. to 2:35 p.m., which was especially jarring during my freshman year after spending three years of middle school with a 9 a.m. start time.
Of course, any high schooler would probably say they need to start school later — who would say no to sleeping in? But now that I’ve had a few years of school days mostly starting around 8 or 9 a.m., I’d still advocate that a later start time makes a world of a difference in terms of student morale and health. And some California lawmakers agree, as demonstrated by a recent bill that would mandate a later start time for schools.
The bill, introduced last week by state Senator Anthony Portantino, would require California middle and high schools to start their school day no earlier than 8:30 a.m. This time is backed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which released a policy statement in 2014 that advocated for a start time of 8:30 a.m. or later.
The statement noted that currently, many school schedules do not line up with teenagers’ natural sleep cycles. If their first period class starts at 7:30 a.m. the following day, this automatically sets them up for failure in obtaining the recommended eight hours of sleep each night.
Studies have shown that more sleep can lead to better grades, reduced risk of car accidents, lessened risk of depression and becoming overweight, higher standardized test scores and an overall better quality of life.
This isn’t news to current high school or even college students. For the most part, getting to bed before 11 p.m. is nearly impossible for most high school students, especially those juggling heavy course loads, extracurricular activities and part-time jobs. But even if they do get to sleep at their recommended 11 p.m. bedtime, they’ll most likely need to wake up before reaching their eighth hour of sleep. With a 7:30 a.m. school start time, they would probably need to wake up at least an hour before — around 6:30 a.m. — to have enough time for preparation and transportation to school.
Still, the underlying problem to students’ lack of sleep is undoubtedly their crammed schedules. If students weren’t juggling so many activities, they’d have more time to get their homework done sooner, resulting in an earlier bedtime. However, those arguing that students should cut back on their activities instead of relying on a later start time are ignoring how highly competitive today’s high school environment is.
Similar to the school start time itself, the issue of overloaded schedules couldn’t be resolved without some sort of impossible mandate. Otherwise, you can’t expect one student to cut back on their activities, knowing all the while that their peers in others schools and districts are continuing to overbook themselves in order to load up their college applications. And obviously, it would be impossible to implement legislation that limits after-school activities. Furthermore, it may be easy to tell the kid on five sports teams that they need to quit one, but what about the student who needs to work 20 hours a week to help support their family or save for college?
The plague of overscheduled teens is definitely an issue, and one without a clear solution. Starting school later will at least allow students to get in some extra shuteye while they’re pressured to keep up with increasingly crowded schedules.
Statistics show that students need more sleep, and as of now the clearest solution is to build another hour of sleep into their mornings. A world without busy work or excessive extracurriculars is an impossible ideal. For now, it is best to adapt to these realities by pushing back school start times.

Research has shown that people with chronic insomnia almost invariably marked deficiencies of these key nutrients as B-complex vitamins, and vitamin C and D as also calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, and zinc. The sleep mechanism is unable to work efficiently unless all these nutrients exists in adequate amounts in the diet. 
A balanced diet with simple modifications in the eating pattern will help in the procedure and cure of insomnia. Such a diet should exclude white-colored flour services and products, sugar as well as its products, tea, coffee, chocolate, cola drinks, alcohol, fatty foods, fried meals, foods containing additives, that is chemicals for preserving, colouring and flavouring, extortionate use of sodium, and strong condiments.  
I read this interesting guide insomniafix.­site that gave me a lot of useful advice on my disease and also a different perspective on the best therapeutical approach. I think you should read it too.
Perfectly written!

There is wisdom to the adage “early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.” Many students, however, are finding it very difficult to do just that. Although many studies have shown that delaying school start times by as much as an hour may increase student performance, an underlying problem is not being addressed: the time-consuming lifestyles that many students are forced to lead. The proposed California Senate Bill 328 will not cause teenagers to develop the time-management skills necessary to secure a healthy amount of sleep. Without that additional sleep, students will not be able to capitalize on the school day’s later start, so the bill will likely fail to achieve its intended purpose. A more realistic objective is to reduce the amount of busy work assigned to students at home, which would free up additional time to sleep.
The school day will not get shorter under the proposed California bill; the bill only mandates that classes will begin no earlier than 8:30 a.m. As such, students will not experience any saved time — classes and activities will inevitably be proportionately pushed back. The fact that teenagers do not sleep enough is well-documented, but it is unclear how changing the start of the school day will affect the amount of sleep that students get each night. If the problem is that students are overcommitted, travel too far for school or have other time-consuming conditions, it is foolish to assume that the simple act of changing the hour that each event takes place will solve anything.
The rhetorical appeal of a later start is certainly strong. There is no shortage of students — even at USC — who would love nothing more than for school to start later. But the real issue isn’t when school starts, it is when students go to sleep. Furthermore, it is the slew of commitments that students have inside and outside of school that dictate when they can sleep, not the time that school begins.
Some students in middle school have reported having two to four hours of homework per night. Advanced Placement students in high school often have just as much, and sometimes even more. If California wants to help students perform better and enjoy healthier sleep habits, it should cap the amount of homework that middle school and high school students trudge home with each day rather than simply delaying the time that school starts. 
I was very aware in high school that I needed to sleep enough in order to function. I made it my goal to sleep at 10 p.m. each night. Homework, however, constantly got in the way of that goal.
Consider this: My high school classes started at 7:50 a.m. each morning during my senior year. I took an additional morning class that lasted for about an hour before school started, so I was on campus at 6:30 a.m. every day. My school ended around 2:45 p.m. However, I rarely left campus at that time because I had wrestling practice at school in the afternoon and evening. I also worked part-time. By the time I would get home on days that I worked, it would often be 7:30 p.m. or later. Now add in the time necessary to eat, perform the most basic of family social functions and the two to four hours of homework each night from taking several AP classes, and I was left with about six hours of sleep on a regular basis. This is a far cry from the recommended eight to nine hours, which proponents of California Senate Bill 328 claim the bill will somehow contribute to securing for students.
If California values the sleep schedules of teenage students, this is an unacceptable state of affairs. If even half of the time that students commonly spend on homework is devoted to sleeping rather than pointless busy work, California students could rest eight or nine hours a night and likely actually see the benefits that California Senate Bill 328 only promises to provide them.
The solution I have proposed is constructive and practical — California Senate Bill 328’s solution simply moves the hour hand on the clock forward.

Of all the elements that make or break student life and the lives of Angelenos at large, it is perhaps housing choice and availability which wields one of the largest impacts. On March 7, L.A. voters will have the power to make a substantial impact on the future of development and housing availability for the city and more importantly, student housing through Measure S, known as the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative. 
In an effort to block any general or specific site amendments to the largely outdated L.A. city zoning code, Measure S, aims to halt all large-scale development in the city of Los Angeles by suspending the zoning code. 
It is no secret that housing in Los Angeles is expensive. Rent costs in Los Angeles now run above those in other metropolitan cities such as Chicago, Miami and Seattle.  Proponents of the initiative hope that it will “fight corruption and backroom deals,”  “empower Los Angeles communities,” “fight traffic”  and “[encourage] affordable housing,” according to the Yes on Measure S website..
However, the only people Measure S would help if passed are homeowners who have the privilege of already owning property in Los Angeles prior to the measure’s implementation. This initiative will do nothing to help, and everything to hurt, efforts to solve the housing crisis. The Not In My Backyard movement of Los Angeles by residents who oppose new developments because they are close to them has become a toxic force which flies in the face of community demand and market forces. 
Though local politicians like to blanket solutions under the shroud of government mandates and initiatives, the real key to alleviating our housing crisis and high rent is, simply put, more housing. The barrier to entry for home ownership is high in Los Angeles. A ban on development would not only make homeownership an even more difficult pursuit, but it would also exacerbate the housing situation for lower-income renters and students. In this sense, Measure S is a government tool of cronyism utilized by the wealthy to maintain exclusive grasp over their premium lifestyle while disadvantaging poorer non-owners. 
What is even more troubling for the USC community in particular is the potential halt of student housing development near the University Park campus. With each new development around USC, the options for housing increase, and the strain of finding suitable options decreases. Greater housing availability also helps decrease commuting pressures and drives down rent in the area through further housing competition. 
It is now commonplace, in the face of Los Angeles’ outdated zoning code, that new large-scale commercial developments undergo an amendment and strewn-out entitlements process as opposed to conforming to existing zoning. For large-scale housing developments in the University Park area, such as University Gateway Apartments, West 27th Place Student Apartments, Tuscany Apartments and the Lorenzo, it is common that these developments adjust height requirements, negotiate lot density, increase the number of floors  through park fees and so on. With Measure S, the negotiations that take place between developers and the city would not only be halted, but the developments that result from these negotiations would be as well. Housing options that some students rely on could be struck down, potentially causing both demand and rates to spike. 
Coming March 7, it will be up to Los Angeles to come to vote no on Measure S and protect housing availability. Already, Mayor Eric Garcetti, along with the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Architects, a number of local Chamber of Commerce groups, United Way of Greater Los Angeles, a number of County Supervisors and City Council members and a long list of homeless advocacy groups have expressed opposition to Measure S. In the words of the opposition’s public relations campaign, the government overreach and overall poor policies and lack of forethought proposed by Measure S simply “go too far.”
Don’t be fooled by the Yes on S crowd. They are bankrolled by elite millionaire homeowners that want to increase the price of housing for their own personal gain, at the expense of everyone else. LA is in a housing crisis and can use additional development in any way possible. These homeowners do not care about people that are priced out of the market, such as USC students.
This comment wins the most bizarre ridiculous BS award. 
Measure S has been badly misrepresented in this article. Many areas are fighting displacement due to the projects Measure S wants a two year moratorium on, before these communities are gone.
South LA..is an area fighting displacement & supports Measure S
This is from ‘The Crenshaw Subway Coalition’..
43,756 PEOPLE…A displacement study conducted on the impact of The Reef, a proposed development in historic South
Central with 1,440 luxury housing units priced well above the level affordable to the surrounding residents, found that the project would put 43,756 residents at a very high to moderate risk of being  displaced.That is the impact of having just ONE mega development with so many “market-rate” units imposed on a South LA community.
This is not academic for us. And we’ve seen it before locally and in other parts of the country. What we are witnessing is a form of economic violence, and no corner in South L.A. is safe.
The Reef project, the proposed 30-story Cumulus skyscraper at La Cienega/Jefferson with 1,200 luxury apartments, and the nearly 1,000 all-luxury housing element of the Crenshaw Mall redevelopment in Leimert Park all break the same zoning law so that they can be built in areas that they don’t belong: General Plan Amendments.
MEASURE S is one solution to stop these massive traffic-causing projects from wiping out all that we have built – our community, our institutions, our relationships with our neighbors….encouraging development not displacement…
On March 7th, literally our neighborhood is on the ballot.
This is a Social Justice issue.
Dear Friends,
As a registered voter I know that, like me, you care about the future of our city.  For decades, my calling has been to serve the homeless on the streets of Skid Row.
In the past 15 years our city has lost more than 22,000 rent-controlled units, and in Skid Row alone more than 5,000 homeless beds have been lost since the 1990s.
Instead of proposing real solutions to America’s worst housing and homeless crisis, City Hall is engaged in a corrupt system of approving luxury towers that violate zoning rules, destroy affordable housing and gridlock our streets. With rents in the new luxury developments starting at $3,500 per month, neighborhoods are being damaged and neighbors are being pushed out – many onto the streets.That’s why I have joined a broad coalition to pass Measure S on the March 7 ballot.
Measure S is a People’s Initiative to fix City Hall’s broken and corrupt planning system that is fueling the worst housing, homeless and traffic crises in America.
I’m urging you to JOIN US in this campaign.
Endorse Measure S.
Volunteer for Yes on S.
Share this message with your neighbors and follow us on social media.
Join this People’s Movement, because on March 7th all of our Neighbors and all of our Neighborhoods are on the ballot.
Thank you your consideration,
Rev. Alice Callaghan
Founder, Las Familias del Pueblo, Skid Row
The L.A. Tenants Union has also endorsed Measure S
Don’t be fooled by this person. Measure S would shut down development in minority communities such as South LA. It is a racist measure that will only benefit millionaire housing owners who want their property values to go up. If S passes, rents will go up in minority communities that desperately need development. But these millionaire housing owners do not care, as long as they make an extra buck. Vote NO on S.
Guess you didn’t attend the Yes on S Crenshaw Subway Coalition and Siuth LA Firum supporting Yes in S and fighting displacement an gentrification due to proposed illegal projects Measre S is against
You can lie about this being a wealthy homeowner Measure til you’re blue in the face but everyone knows you’re spewing fake facts. Take it up with south central, Boyle Heights, south LA fighting to stay in their communities. Continuing your fake news and  lies does not somehow magically make your lies truth.
The fact that USC contributed $50,000 to the no on S makes you even less believable.
yes you are right, it will SHUT DOWN the construction of luxury housing in South LA, something that few in that area can afford.  Minority communities do not need more luxury homes which will inevitably end with their displacement and the white-washing of their communities.
Another lie. Measure S does not target luxury housing. It targets ALL housing that requires an exemption. This “luxury housing” lie is a ruse by the wealthy elitist landowners that do not want minority communities to develop. NO on S.

BILLIONAIRES  Thrive on LA’s Broken System, Need to Stop Measure S Because:
Kahn Cousins – Want two skyscrapers, Century City and Hollywood, with no known affordable units. In Hollywood, Kahn’s demand for a skyscraper is flatly banned by the Community Plan.
Frank McCourt – Wants to fill up Dodger Stadium parking lots with a luxury mini-city, banned by the Community Plan.
Frank Lowy – Worth $68 billion, Lowy wants a 15,000 seat Stadium “arena” in quiet Woodland Hills, almost as big as The Forum. Banned by local zoning.
Lowes – Resort hotel billionaires, may be seeking open-space on the Westside that’s supposed to be a park-for a luxury hotel, banned by zoning.
John B. Kilroy Jr – Billionaire heir wants to build The Academy, a sprawling $300 million complex with a 23-story residential high rise along gridlocked Vine and De Longpre.
Victor Coleman – Speculating on land in LA, because zoning is “for sale” at City Hall. Wants luxury towers in communities.
Clyde Holland – Donald Trump’s campaign backer is gearing up to seek major favors and zoning exemptions from City Hall.
Phil Anschutz – Worth $12.4 billion, unknown what zoning favors he wants from City Hall. 
(Individuals and their companies giving to “Coalition to Protect L.A. Neighborhoods and Jobs,” as of 2/6/2017, according to LA City Ethics Commission website)
Articles based on myths belong in the religion section.  USC has it own Sol Price School of Public Policy and readings is various studies might be a good place to start before making up stuff.  Alt-Facts may be popular, but they are still Alt-facts.  Simply put, as Judge Goodman ruled, Garcertti bases his housing policies on Fatally Flawed Data and Wishful Thinking to the extent that he subverts the law.  Measure S attempts to stop some of the destructive housing policies and reduce the corruption at LA City Council.
We’re voting yes on S!!
Whole blocks are coming down to make way for these projects. People don’t know where they will go. They have children in area schools. The tiny pittance of affordable developers offer in return for the huge bonuses city council and this mayor gives them are not worth it. We don’t need 45 story towers at subway stops as they lie this is all for public transit takers convenience. Public transit takers can’t afford to live in them. Those that can aren’t giving up cars or riding bikes as the mayor lies and he has developers give way less than needed parking and way more than will ever be used bicycle racks. Whoever wrote this please get a clue. The prices of these projects is way out of most people’s affordability. And the LA Times investigative reports about developer politico corruption to get  Caruso and Sea Breeze projects approved, zone busting projects,  proved the city’s being rebuilt badly with no concerns about the people who live here on campaign contributions. Check out lobbying expenditures, and campaign contributions. Every controversial ‘Spot Zone’ project has campaign contributions connected. Mega amounts of money. They get approved, people sue, they get shut down by Judges. We can save the city a lot of money they claim they don’t have and now must borrow money if they are forced to abide by zoning, laws, and area plans. Really work on updating plans which no one trusts they will do unless forced to by the people voting for Measure S . Measure S could stop the bad boys led by the worst developer puppet, Garcetti from breaking laws to accommodate their developer bosses projects.
We’re voting YES on S and NO on Garcetti
Five more years of this developer puppet and LA will never recover.
Fight on!
Vote Yes on S if you want more affordable housing instead of illegal over sized zone busting projects Measure S addresses that require amendments to the general plan, which goes against  the city charter, are unaffordable luxury projects for the wealthy, up the value of the real estate and every project that follows must be as profit making as huge as community killing as traffic inducing as unaffordable. They are given every illegal variance requested the bigger they are the more profit they make meanwhile communities are destroyed by projects quadruple the density and height allowed, they are even granted use of half the city sidewalks as the city claims an area will be more walkable, how? With most of the sidewalk gone? They are wiping out good existing  residential communities, many times affordable,  sometimes rent stabilized, push them out, cause displacement, displacement many times cause homelessness. 22,000 Rent Stabilized Units have been wiped out in the last few years. The LA Tenants Union endorsed Measre S. Every mayoral candidate at debates Garcetti does not ever show up at, talks about how these projects are wiping out the middle class of LA and it soon will be a city only for the very wealthy and very poor. 100% affordable housing is exempt from Measure S. 5-10% development is affected. It certainly is not a housing ban and building certainly will not stop. Don’t believe the no on S lies all supported by billionaires and wealthy developers who prefer this system, having their hired guns do EIR studies ( Measure S will put studies in more neutral hands) working with outdated plans, upzining everything  parcel by parcel,  pay to play,  to get projects approved,  this anything goes way of doing things. They are getting wealthier on the backs of communities they ruin.Measure  S as Rev Alice Callaghan, skid row activist and endorser says,  is The People’s Measure.. not the developers, not the developer funded politicians, not the developer funded Chambers, not the real estate interests, etc. but the people from many communities across LA from south LA to silverlake, to west Los Angeles, westchester, throughout the valley, all across LA fighting displacement, neighborhoods ruined, wiped out, fighting to stay in their neighborhoods and homes.
Yes on S!
The only people around USC that support Measure S are selfish landlords that do not want competition so that they can squeeze every extra penny of rent from USC students. USC students already live 2, 3, 4 people to a room because there is a lack of housing and the limited housing is uber expensive. On top of that, management companies treat students poorly because they have no competition. These companies support measure S for their own selfish reasons, and I suspect many of these pro-S comments  are bought and paid by the millionaire apartment owners. Shame on them for exploiting USC students.
Chad, it appears that neither you nor the editors thought it worthwhile to mention that you’re studying real estate development, or that you work with the Trojan Real Estate Association (TREA).  If your readers had that information, it might help them to judge whether or not you could truly be considered unbiased when writing an opinion piece on issues related to development.  I also thought your bio on the TREA web page was interesting.  It states, “Living in an ever expanding Orange County he was able to see first hand trends that lead to unique, healthy and engaging communities.”  Many people look at Orange County as one of the worst examples of suburban sprawl, with its endless car-centric enclaves geared towards the affluent.  But as a native, you probably have a better understanding of the area than the rest of us.  It’s fine if you feel moved to share your views on ballot measures with others, but full disclosure about your career path would make it easier for readers to judge the worth of your ideas.
Thank you!
This article is very upsetting and nothing but developer propaganda.

At 18 years old, a sixth of my life is quite possibly already over, maybe even a fifth. Never again will I be absolutely absolved from responsibility, the way I was when I was three and had all the time in the world, sparing not a thought to matters that did not involve Clifford the Big Red Dog. All that stretches before me is a sea of taxes and Social Security and grocery shopping — truly an appealing prospect.   
My God, how fleeting and fragile life is! But to my thinking, while we’re here, there’s no reason not to enjoy ourselves. I’ve never bought into the “existence is futile and meaningless” crap. It seems like such defeatist thinking. Doesn’t perpetual bitterness get tiring after a while? Isn’t constant cynicism exhausting to maintain? 
I would call myself a hedonist, though that invites negative connotations. A hedonist is, to many minds, someone who engages in mass debauchery: wild orgies and gross overindulgence and the like. The word hedonism is evocative of sex, because sex is the highest and purest form of pleasure, right?
That’s not what I mean. The ticket is to appreciate the simple things: the smell of rain, loose leaf jasmine tea and Leonid Afremov paintings. Yeah, it’s cliche, but it’s true. Finding beauty in the mundane, putting a positive spin on whatever crosses your path, because that’s just so much more fun. Being alive wasn’t a choice, but you’ll sure get a hell of a lot more out of it if you stop taking it so seriously. Don’t you want to feel good, genuinely good, rather than the perverse pleasure derived from hunkering down in your basement and festering in your own misanthropy, secure in your self-perceived superiority over your fellow human beings?    
I simply cannot fathom why one would choose to commit suicide. Why cut your life short, when it’s still saturated with potential droplets of pleasure? You’ve never ordered a crepe in a Paris cafe or bathed in the crystalline Reykjavik hot springs or stood on the edge of the Grand Canyon and shouted your name to hear it reverberate against the rust red ravines. There is so much yet to explore. If I could, I would snatch up all the time you relinquished when you decided to end it all and add it to my own stockpile. I would never have enough to check off everything on my bucket list. 
Of course, I grew up — am growing up — surrounded by a dense layer of packing peanuts, safely cushioned from the crushing blows life is capable of dealing. I freely admit to my naivete. But I have only my own experience upon which to base my philosophies, and I find it incredible that people would choose to throw away the greatest gift they have ever received.
I want to travel this world and experience everything it has to offer me, soak it all in. I want to milk every last droplet of pleasure from my existence, wring it dry, until it crumbles into a powdery dust. Except I can’t. In this capitalistic society, free spirits and independent thinkers are actively discouraged; all America wants is another automaton to join the workforce. I’d need money to carry out my dreams, and to obtain money, I’d need to work, and by the time I’d have retired, my bones will creak and my joints will ache and any opportunity of carrying out my dreams will have slipped away quietly while I was preoccupied with the daily nine-to-five grind.
