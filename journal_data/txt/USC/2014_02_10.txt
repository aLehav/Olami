On Monday, University of California, Santa Barbara professor Christopher Newfield, spoke with USC faculty about their role in university governance.
Faculty advocate · University of California, Santa Barbara professor, Christopher Newfield, spoke to USC faculty in Leavey Auditorium Monday afternoon on the need to increase their role in administrative decisions. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
Newfield represented the American Association of University Professors at the event and discussed issues in the current process for decision making and the need to increase the voice of faculty in the university setting. He has long advocated the need for professors to take a leading role in administrative decisions.
“The administration is oppressive, and faculty are submissive,” Newfield said.
Until the American Association of University Professors was instituted on campus last year, Newfield said there was no faculty body that could raise issues of tenure and low salaries without administration present.
AAUP Western Regional Coordinator Jason Elias said Monday’s talk marked one of the first meetings of the AAUP on USC’s campus, and after many of the recent disagreements between the administration and faculty, it was an opportune time.
Elias noticed that last semester, poetry professor Cecilia Woloch was forced to leave when the university administration cut her stipend for the two Dornsife programs she created and Woloch could no longer afford to live in Los Angeles.
“That the administration has used those programs to try to recruit ‘transformative’ faculty — at five times my salary — while refusing to even mention my name in association with those programs, makes it clear to me that I’ll never be recognized or rewarded for my contributions,” Woloch wrote in a letter to USC officials at the time.
Elias said the disagreement exemplified the issue of inadequate and non-tenure track salaries, as well as the university’s mistreatment of esteemed faculty.
“[Dornsife] Dean [Steve] Kay’s new interpretation of the faculty handbook is that if a tenured faculty doesn’t attend a meeting, they cannot know the outcome or the discussions during the tenure meeting,” Elias said.
But Newfield said university administrators’ mistreatment of faculty is not an isolated issue. He said last year a UCLA professor filed a racial discrimination suit against the university after he was called a “gorilla” at an event where students mock their professors.
Christian Head was the only African-American tenured professor at the school’s department of head and neck surgery. Head received a 4.5 million dollar settlement, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Newfield said it is important for universities to remain accountable for treating their faculty respectfully and to foster an atmosphere of creativity so that students can take advantage of their expertise.
“[Universities] should be faculty decision zones as opposed to faculty consultation zones,” Newfield said.
This article misses almost all the main points of Professor Newfield’s talk. It makes no mention, for example, of his key argument that universities have tended not to take advantage of the expertise of their own faculty in making important decisions about the direction and future investments of the institution. It especially misses the tone and tenor of the talk, which sought above all to encourage faculty to reinvigorate shared governance structures. Finally, although the event was sponsored by the AAUP chapter at USC, Professor Newfield was invited as an independent scholar and the author of highly celebrated work on the American university. 
Peggy Kamuf
Professor of French and Comparative Literature
While I appreciate your coverage of the event described above, the piece has a couple of mistakes worth mentioning. Although the AAUP sponsored the event, I do not represent the AAUP in any way.  My talk described several recent controversies that might have been averted had faculty been made central to administrative decisions at the start.  The rise and rapid fall of Massive Open Online Courses was one example, since faculty knew from the beginning that the educational claims made by MOOC advocates were grossly exaggerated.  I also discussed four features of meaningful faculty self-governance.  I don’t think that oppression/submission is the general state of admin-faculty relations either at USC or anywhere else.  I did describe it as a tendency when faculty are overly passive about the fates of their teaching (and non teaching) colleagues.  Towards the end of the event, members of the audience described some personnel decisions on this campus that seemed aberrant to me, and these cases may be something the academic senate here will want to review.  Finally, I’d add that students also have an interest in good academic personnel processes, since bad ones can lower the quality of the instruction they get in their courses.

Brandon Spencer, the man accused of shooting a rival gang member on campus last Halloween, was convicted of four counts of attempted murder on Monday, according to the Los Angeles Times. Spencer could face life in prison.
Halloween shooting · Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department place shooting victim Geno Hall into an ambulance Nov. 1, 2012 following the attack in Tutor Center Auditorium. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Twenty-one-year-old Spencer shot twenty-two-year-old Geno Hall in October of 2012 amid a crowd of more than 100 people waiting in line to enter a Halloween party at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom hosted by the Black Student Assembly. Prosecutors argued in court that Spencer committed the shooting in retaliation for a gunshot wound he suffered a year earlier. They said the shooting was further motivated by a fight between Spencer and Hall on Twitter.
Police maintain that Spencer attempted to flee the scene, discarding his shirt in the process. Spencer was found near a USC parking lot half a mile from the shooting scene. Police recovered a black revolver they believed to be Spencer’s three hours after the shooting.
Hall sustained four wounds and three other men were injured in the shooting. According to the L.A. Times, Hall testified that he still has a bullet lodged in his pelvis area and continues to suffer from back pain due to the incident.
A USC Dept. of Public Safety officer testified that he saw Spencer lift the gun out of his waistband. The officer later identified Spencer out of the possible suspects detained due to his height, clothing and skin shade.
Spencer’s attorney John Blanchard defended his client by saying that many partygoers were wearing clothing similar to Spencer’s. Furthermore, Blanchard noted that the DNA found on the gun was only a partial match, according to the L.A. Times.
Blanchard told reporters that Spencer plans to appeal.

The parents of the two slain USC graduate students from China have asked the school to pay restitutions after Bryan Barnes pleaded guilty to their murder last Wednesday in court.

The students were shot and killed a mile off campus in April of 2012.
Daniel Deng, legal advisor to the parents of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, noted the families were relieved to learn of Barnes’ conviction.
“[Following the murder] Ming Qu’s mom has been crying all day and was hospitalized several times when suffering from depression,” Deng said. “It was a big relief for them when the killer was caught and convicted.”
Deng expressed, however, that the parents have hit hard times and need the restitutions.
“But at the same time, both of the families are in need financially,” he said. “After the loss of their children, they could not work like before. They could not even afford the airfare to come to Los Angeles.”
Deng said the nature of Chinese culture has worsened the financial situation for the parents.
“In Chinese culture, parents invest in kids hoping their kids would find a job and would care for them later,” he said. “Since there is no social security system in China, children are their social security systems.”
The parents are asking the university to refund $200,000 in tuition for both students as well as a $200,000 reward originally offered by USC and the Los Angeles Police Department last year for providing information during the murder investigation.
USC responded to the parents’ claim last Thursday with the following statement.
“In a gesture of sympathy and kindness, the university had initially offered to compensate the parents for the cost of their children’s education and other expenses,” the press release stated. “The parents declined USC’s offer and instead chose to engage an attorney to sue the university. The courts did not find the university responsible. Our university community continues to mourn the loss of Ying Wu and Ming Qu. The USC Viterbi School of Engineering created an on-campus memorial to the two students and we posthumously awarded their degrees.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, the parents had originally filed a civil suit against the university that was later dismissed.
Deng responded to the statement by saying the parents were too devastated at that time to talk about any financial issues and wanted to find out if USC had any legal liability for the incident.
“They wanted to find out the truth to it first,” Deng said. “They retained a civil lawyer to look into whether the school had any liability on this one and to make sure the school has done everything necessary for all the students on and off campus. Last year, they were devastated because of the loss of their child. They did not think any amount of money would replace their children.”
Filing the lawsuit last year was not a matter of winning or losing for the parents, Deng said.
“They wanted to bring security to USC campus and make sure it would not happen to any other family,” he said.
Students have had mixed opinions about the parents’ request, with some citing concerns over the unsafe nature of the university’s surrounding area.
“A shooting happened in my apartment, [The Lorenzo,] last week,” said Chaoyi Li, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “Our parents pay for not only my education, but also safety near campus. USC needs to provide an environment so students can be alive and be safe.”
Rachael Lee, a senior studying communication, however, argued that it wasn’t USC’s responsibility to pay.
“I don’t know if any compensation measures up to the lives that have been taken, and I don’t really understand why USC has to be the one paying restitution,” Lee said.
USC has been very generous to the community surrounding this campus.  What more can be done to make the areas around USC safer?
They’re trying to profit from the murder of their children. That’s disgusting. Note that SC offered to refund their tuition but the families sued instead, lost, and is now back asking for money again. The murders were tragic but this response is morally appalling.

Many times throughout the semester, students can find themselves in a rut, trapped in the routine of Seeds for every meal or the EVK menu getting a little old. Thankfully, less than a mile down Figueroa Street, the newly opened City Tavern is available to anyone in dire need of some comfort food that won’t break the bank.
Cheap date · The low prices and delicious gourmet style dishes at the new City Tavern location at Figat7th are sure to help any college student explore new food options without breaking the bank. – Photo courtesy of City Tavern
The second of its kind opened by owners Ken Kaufman, Brian McKeaney and Dave Northrup after the wild success of the original Culver City location, City Tavern offers a welcoming place to grab a great meal. Walking in the door, customers are welcomed by warm lighting and an open dining space. High ceilings, exposed decorative lightbulbs and chalkboard walls immediately grab one’s attention and add to the rustic ambiance. For those looking for a casual bar scene, the restaurant has an impressive bar that offers a wide selection of craft beers, California wines and signature cocktails.
The staff at City Tavern is both attentive and knowledgeable. Despite the restaurant only having been open for a short time period, the waiters were very familiar with the menu and had good suggestions as to which dishes to try.
The menu is split into categories ranging from “share” to “plates” to “held,” sandwiches and burgers diners eat with their hands. The widely varied menu has something for everyone.
The farmhouse cheese board, a three-cheese plate, has an array of fine cheese and amazing accompaniments. The Humboldt Fog offers a mix of Brie and blue cheese flavors delectably paired with the sweetness of candied apricot. The only downside to the plate? The crouton is far too thick and overpowered the other flavors the plate had to offer. Overall, however, the dish is well thought out, and the pairings help evolve a simple cheese plate.
The homemade mac and cheese was the ultimate comfort food. Topped with breadcrumbs and doused in gooey sharp cheddar, it is everything one would hope it to be.
It’s impossible not to finish the grilled bread salad — a delicious twist on a caprese salad. The grilled ciabatta bread, tomato, basil and mozzarella, topping a bed of crisp lettuce and tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and pesto, offered up a light and fresh plate.
The pulled pork sandwich was sweet and sloppy — the epitome of good Southern comfort food. The massive sandwich is a great choice for a delicious meal.
The pork pot roast came to the table piping hot with exquisite presentation. Upon cutting into the roast, it cut like butter, a great sign of a good meal. The sauce topping the meat was thick and sweet and complimented the pork flawlessly. The gratin potatoes, cut perfectly thin and well-cooked, were the highlight of the dish. Braised vegetables rounded out the dish, but were a disappointment compared to its outstanding companions.
For dessert, the bread pudding topped with caramel and fresh whipped cream was simple and delicious.
For a student who hasn’t strayed from a diet of Easy Mac and Caesar salads for the past week, City Tavern’s promise of gourmet comfort food was right on point. A pretty extensive meal for three people cost only $65.40, an unheard of final receipt for any decent restaurant in Downtown Los Angeles, and an answer to any college student’s nearly empty wallet. The food was incredible, each menu item a delicious twist on a classic meal, the restaurant itself was warm and relaxing, and it’s only a short hop off campus in the Figat7th complex. With all it has to offer, City Tavern will have a line of hungry customers out the door in no time.

You might not have heard about it, but ShopWalk DTLA happened last Sunday. The event — a functional walking tour of local business in Downtown Los Angeles complete with discounts and specials at more than the 50 participating locations — was an interesting look at just how much the area’s retail scene has grown.
It seemed like something worth writing about (I was originally planning on doing a column on dating in Los Angeles for Valentine’s Day, but trust me, you’re happier without it), so I took the Expo line from the Exposition Park/USC station down to the 7th St./ Metro Center stop and spent the afternoon following the ShopWalk DTLA map. I ordered a Salted Caramel ice cream cone at Peddler’s Creamery and poked my nose into the different shops; getting some vintage style inspiration from Buttons & Bows and finally seeing the newly opened Ace Hotel on South Broadway, which has been generating a lot of buzz, in part for the announcement that it will be hosting the artist collective L.A. Dance Project. It felt like a natural way to spend a lazy Sunday.
If I make a trip downtown past Figueroa, I generally have a specific destination in mind, like the Central Library or Casey’s Irish Pub. I normally reserve browsing local shops for a day in Echo Park or York Boulevard. I think the main reason for that is I don’t perceive the historic Downtown core as a boutique business area.
But it’s there, if you know where to look.
In the three short years I’ve attended USC, I’ve watched as commercial centers such as FIGat7th have reshaped the geographic landscape of Figueroa. But further downtown, it’s some of the more subtle moves, like the recent facelift of Grand Central Market by Adele Yellin, that have gone a long, quiet way in reshaping the culture.
Carrie Cheung, one of the organizers for ShopWalk DTLA, said that she hopes the event helps to re-introduce people to the historic Downtown core.
“It’s a cool place to hang out, have coffee, shop,” Cheung said. “There are a lot of mom and pop shops, a lot of new things happening all the time. I’ve been in the neighborhood five years, and the area has already changed so much.”
Cheung said that ShopWalk DTLA, which started in 2012, has grown organically. She was a manager of a building and got to know her neighbors through that. They got together to do an event to highlight the Historic Core as an unique neighborhood.
“Our budget is small, but we do this because we love the Downtown community and we want to support the owners who live in downtown and own businesses Downtown,” Cheung said.
I could see where she was coming from. It was nice to have a reason to go downtown. Though there were parts of the trip that didn’t feel walking friendly, I never felt unsafe. And there were a number of places I took mental notes to come back to (Pete’s Cafe, which was offering a $5 sliders, fries and drink combination for the day will definitely garner a return trip).
It’s not hard to argue that Downtown is in the early stages of a renaissance. There is a younger population that is becoming more interested in the area. A low cost of living has helped to attract young, creative residents. Creative Time Reports posted an article by the artist Moby who argued that “…young artists in L.A. can really experiment, and if their efforts fall short, it’s not that bad because their rent is relatively cheap and almost everyone else they know is trying new things and failing, too.” There is also housing available for those looking: approximately 5,000 residential market rate units are currently under construction — from South Park to Chinatown and from Bunker Hill to the Arts District according to DTLA Rising.
The growth can also be attributed to money. Former councilwoman and head of the new L.A. economic development agency Jan Perry made an impact on the area through multiple redevelopment projects during her term. Today, more money is being infused downtown — namely a $160 million makeover of The Bloc (formerly Macy’s Plaza) which includes a $40 million update to the Sheraton Hotel next door.
And there’s something to be said for how easy it is to get there. From taking the metro or using an affordable Lyft or Uber ride-sharing option, it won’t break the bank to get downtown from USC.
This is the sixth event in the series and Cheung said that each event has gotten a little bigger. Still, I was surprised not to see more people carrying the ShopWalk map as I took my walk. I could, however, see more people coming back as the word continues to spread. The only thing I would suggest for future trips is don’t wear boots. I did on Sunday and sorely regretted it.
If you do your own walking tour, you’ll definitely be happier in sneakers.

Based in Greenwich Village, Murray’s Cheese Brand has recently expanded to 100 stores nationwide, bringing its cheesy heaven to foodies everywhere. Luckily for L.A. residents, the one-hundredth store — a milestone in the company’s history — happens to be located in Studio City,  Calif., officially establishing the brand as coast-to-coast.
Cheese-ception · Murray’s Cheese builds stores within larger stores. The project began when the brand partnered with Kroger in 2008. – Jonathan Wong | Daily Trojan
Murray’s Cheese Bar was opened in 1940 by Murray Greenberg to cater to the wealthy Italian population on Bleecker Street at the time. Murray’s was a humble family-owned shop on the corner until the early nineties when Rob Kaufelt took the then-failing business into his own hands. He traveled the globe to vastly expand his store’s collection, making it the well-established and respected store it is today, all while keeping the family-run feel at the core of the company.
Murray’s nationwide venture began in 2008 through a partnership with Kroger, the parent company of Ralphs. The grocery store offers 300 to 400 square feet to create these “stores-within-a-store,” while Murray’s gives it a cheese selection far superior to an average deli counter. Currently, the company’s shops fill Kroger-owned grocery stores in 11 states, and though its 100-store goal is now a reality with the recent opening in Los Angeles, the company plans to continue to expand to Ralphs locations throughout the city.
The local Ralphs grocery store houses the Studio City Murray’s, which greets customers with its signature colorful branding that encompasses the “store-within-a-store.” Shelves are packed with more than 100 types of cheeses, ranging from $5-$30, and trained Ralphs workers are there to offer assistance. Whether customers are looking for classic cheddar or deciding to test out a cheese with a name they can barely pronounce, the Murray’s Cheese section has it all and more.
Every item on display has a thorough description card, telling the customer where the cheese was made and exactly what to expect in taste. Special green labels highlight local items made here in California, such as the San Andreas cheese, made on a farm stationed upon the fault line of the same name. For $29.99 a pound, expect a taste that is “nutty with hints of earth and moss.”
Upon announcing its more recent expansions, Murray’s explained how it is incorporating its brand nationwide through cooperation with local dairy makers.
Murray’s however doesn’t stop at just cheese. The selection of food ranges from crackers and spreads to charcuterie and salts to almonds, antipasti and other classic cheese accompaniments that line the shelves. At $7.99 per pound, one can indulge in an extensive olive bar that fills an entire quarter of the mini store. For $23.99, a brilliantly hand-selected cheese board is already prepared and there for the taking.
A new favorite for California customers is the Happy Goat Caramel Sauce. Though a combination of goat cheese and caramel is hardly what one might imagine to be tasty, the mix of the sweet and smooth flavors creates a delicious topping for cheese, fruit and more. Even though it’s a little pricey at $16.99 for a 10-ounce jar, the sauce is definitely worth a try. For $7 more, one can take the delectable sauce one step further with an Aberlour Speyside 12-year single malt Scotch added to the mix.
Even though everything the store has to offer is great, it might not be worth making the trek to Studio City for the average USC student — unless that student is an avid food lover or likes to eat something  more complex than a bottle of spray cheese and Ritz crackers for an afternoon snack. In addition, what college student on a budget is going to spend $30 on a block of cheese, only to have to buy $5 cheese paper to store it in?
But if you’re in the mood for a drive or want to go grocery shopping at Ralph’s, head north and take a look at the Murray’s Cheese section. Though pricier cheeses such as the San Andreas Cheese are probably out of any students’ price range, there are many selections under $10 per pound. Need more incentive? There are loads of free samples, and hey, maybe you’ll even learn a bit more about different kinds of cheese.

The Glitch Mob released its newest album, Love Death Immortality, today, marking the group’s sophomore effort since its 2010 debut release, Drink the Sea.
For those unfamiliar with The Glitch Mob’s aesthetic, one of the group’s strengths has been its unique song construction.
Love Death Immortality, however, is more grounded in mainstream EDM stylings than the discordant beats and unique sounds that characterized The Glitch Mob’s first album.
It is clear that Love Death Immortality was intended as nothing short of a electronic symphony, and The Glitch Mob’s lush soundscapes are orchestral in their arrangements, with the beginning strains on opening track “Mind of a Beast” setting the tone for the rest of the album.
The album represents a shift away from the more minimal melodies that characterized Drink the Sea and is fully immersed in the kind of full-bodied sounds heard from more popular EDM artists.
It is not just the production on Love Death Immortality that draws from the current EDM scene; vocals, such as the ones featured on “Our Demons,” should appeal to fans of more mainstream EDM. Featuring Aja Volkman, the track utilizes the repetitive, falsetto sounds that characterize a large number of EDM cuts released every year.
Though the repetitive patterns and vocals might entice more EDM fans than non-fans, the darkness and “cool factor” of the Glitch Mob’s sounds should also find fans on the fringes of mainstream music, albeit for only a couple of.
The production on cuts such as the single “Can’t Kill Us” and opening track “Mind of a Beast” is dynamic and compelling, and is worth a listen. Listeners will come away with an understanding of the artistic sensibilities and production capabilities that The Glitch Mob showcased on Drink the Sea, and has potential for inclusion on late-night dark electronic playlists.
These tracks not only showcase what The Glitch Mob is capable of creatively, but also warrant repeated listens, as the song constructions are dynamic enough to hold a listener’s attention again and again.
The stylings on the majority of the tracks on Love Death Immortality might be grounded in the kind of pulsating chords and hard-hitting beats that characterize many of the more well-known artists within EDM. The Glitch Mob, however, utilizes glitch and techno stylings to make their music just a little more different than the average EDM fare.
The driving beats and frenzied synths which build up and drop frequently during tracks are exemplary of the sound of the entire album. As Love Death Immortality progresses, interest level waxes and wanes for the listeners who are not as invested in EDM stylings of music.
Tracks such as “Skytoucher” are unremarkable in their production and development and easily fade from memory as they rely on synth chords and rhythm constructions that are used by many electronic artists in the scene today.
The vocals on cuts such as “Fly By Night Only” add nothing to the sonic mix of the track and could be featured on any vaguely electronic Top 40 track.
Whether these small differences make Love Death Immortality worthy of a full listen depends on how appealing the genre is to the listener.
Love Death Immortality might still draw on production ideas heavily featured on Drink the Sea, but it represents an unquestionable departure from the general sonic soundscape that The Glitch Mob has become known for off of their first album.
This shift will be sure to gain The Glitch Mob a larger fanbase. This change, however, also guarantees a drop off of returning listeners who were expecting the same kind of music that Drink the Sea brought to the electronic scene.
For the listeners who are passionate about the EDM scene, this album will represent an offering of new sounds that melds foundational EDM soundscapes with the glitchy synth sound that makes The Glitch Mob the group  it is.
For returning fans, and for new listeners looking for sounds closer to the fringes of EDM, Love Death Immortality will be nothing new in the constant barrage of electronic music and represents a disappointing transition into the mainstream for The Glitch Mob.

USC’s only winter Olympian in the Sochi games missed her chance to earn a medal on Saturday. Jung-Hwa Seo, a moguls freestyle skier from South Korea who according to her Facebook page is set to graduate from USC in 2014, finished No. 14 in the qualifying run for the women’s mogul event on Saturday.
24-year-old Seo almost missed the qualifying round after a bad fall during a practice run on Friday. The Korea Times reported that Seo fell while practicing at Sochi’s Rosa Khutor Extreme Park and suffered “concussion-like symptoms.”
After putting Seo through several medical tests at a local hospital, doctors cleared her to compete just hours before Saturday’s event.
“She suffered a light bruise to her cervical vertebrae,” an official from the Korea Ski Federation told the Korea Times. “However, the injury isn’t severe and she will be able to compete on Saturday.”
Seo’s efforts were not enough to get her a medal, as only the top 10 skiers advanced to the next round. Seo finished outside of the top 10, at 14th in the qualifier and 24th overall with a score of 14.16.
Seo also competed in the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, where she similarly failed to make it past the qualifying round.
In Seo’s event, Canadian skier Justine Dufour-Lapointe took home the gold, with sister Chloe winning silver and American Hannah Kearney securing the bronze.
Following her event, Seo posted a message on Facebook.
“The result is not [what] I was hoping for [over the] last few years but I am satisfied … that I tried and pushed myself … until the end … Thank you [to] everyone who helped me,” Seo wrote on her profile.
Though the university has more Olympians, medalists and gold medalists than any other university in the world, the vast majority of USC Olympians compete in the summer games. Seo is one of only four winter Olympians to have attended USC.
Overall, 420 USC alumni have competed in the Olympics since 1904. USC alumni have won 135 gold medals, 88 silver medals and 64 bronze medals, but no USC alum has ever won a medal in the winter games. USC athletes have appeared in the Winter Olympic Games nine different times.
If USC were a country, it would rank No. 12 for its number of gold medals. Trojan Olympians have represented 60 countries and competed in 28 different sports.
USC set a new school record in the 2012 London Olympics with 25 total medals, including 12 gold medals.

On Sunday, former Missouri defensive lineman and reigning SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Year Michael Sam announced that he is gay, becoming the first openly gay NFL Draft prospect in league history.
If no active player comes out between now and the start of next season, Sam will be the first gay North American athlete in the four major sports to play in a game (Jason Collins was a member of the NBA’s Washington Wizards when he announced he was gay in May 2013, but did not appear in any games after that due to injury).
Sam’s announcement is a monumental landmark in American sports. The barrier that stands between gay athletes and acceptance has slowly been eroding in recent years, with supporters becoming increasingly vocal. Sam’s declaration is just the latest in what has been a landmark year for gay athletes.
Last February, soccer player Robbie Rogers announced he was gay, and a month later joined the Los Angeles Galaxy, becoming the first openly gay professional athlete in North American sports history.
There have been other famous athletes in the past that have come out as gay. Tennis legend Billie Jean King, Olympic diver Greg Louganis and WNBA star Sheryl Swoopes are among the most notable. But for the longest time, the sport of football has been perceived as the most hostile environment for the gay community.
The atmosphere around football locker rooms, both in college and in the NFL, is one of hyper-masculinity and intimidation in which machismo is the status quo among those involved in the game. Players and coaches are expected to be tough, and the prevailing stereotype of gay men, to many, is that they are weaker than their straight counterparts.
This attitude, which is prevalent in football, appears to be fading away. Last month, Conner Mertens, a kicker at Division III Willamette University, announced that he was bisexual, and the response from his teammates and coaches was overwhelmingly positive. Before Sam went public with his announcement this week, he told his team the truth about his sexuality over the summer, and his teammates stood by him.
What’s most impressive about this is that no one who knew about Sam being gay leaked the story to anybody, even though Sam made no such plea to keep his sexuality a secret. This is evidence that, while Sam’s coming out is definitely an important moment for this country, to the people who matter — Sam, his teammates, his family — this announcement was not a big deal. Missouri’s season went on without a hitch, culminating in a Cotton Bowl victory over Oklahoma State.
Moving on to the NFL as an openly gay man, however, will be uncharted waters for Sam. Though former players such as Chris Kluwe and Brandon Ayanbadejo have expressed support of gay players, there have been a number of remarks from current players that show the league’s overall lack of acceptance. During media day for Super Bowl XLVII last year, 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver made anti-gay remarks when asked if there were any gay players on his team.
“I don’t do the gay guys. I don’t do that,” Culliver told Artie Lange on Lange’s radio show. “We ain’t got no gay people on the team. They gotta get up outta here if they do … Come out 10 years later after [retiring].”
Culliver’s comments came in the midst of an assault trial in which Kwame Harris, a former first round draft pick who last played in the league in 2008, was accused of assaulting his then-boyfriend. During his career, Harris did not openly proclaim his homosexuality. He would later partly attribute his disappointing career to dealing with the burden of concealing his sexuality.
It appears that an NFL locker room remains a tough place for a gay player. Just last week, Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma expressed concern over the possibility of having a gay teammate.
“Imagine if he’s the guy next to me, and you know, I get dressed, naked, taking a shower, the whole nine, and it just so happens he looks at me,” Vilma told NFL Network. “How am I supposed to respond?”
Whichever locker room Sam ends up in next season will be the setting of a very public social experiment. How will Sam be received by those in the league? Many NFL scouts and executives have anonymously stated their belief that his announcement will definitely hurt his draft stock, with most coaches and general managers having concerns that Sam will bring a media circus with him and serve as a distraction.
I don’t expect this to be an issue for long. The NFL might not be the most accepting environment, but in the end it’s a results-based business. If you deliver results, you will gain acceptance. In his college career, Sam has absolutely delivered results, leading the SEC in sacks and tackles for loss last season.
There is also hope that the intimidation factor of the NFL locker room can change. Last season’s incident involving Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin of the Miami Dolphins serves as a telling sign of how hostile a locker room can be, evidenced by the teammates’ text exchanges, which were recently released publicly.
But the season ended with the Seattle Seahawks, led by former USC coach Pete Carroll, as undisputed champions. Carroll has been revered by his players for his constant positivity, and his locker room has been celebrated for its lack of stress and emphasis on kindness and love. Carroll’s methods are unique to the NFL and were once criticized and even mocked, yet he has now delivered results, sparking debate as to whether this type of approach will spread to the rest of the league.
It’s somewhat sad that, to be taken seriously, it seems as though you must win first in order to establish credibility. Perhaps Sam’s NFL career will be unimpressive and brief. He might never become an All-Pro player or even a starter. But with his courageous announcement on Sunday, Sam has already won.

The top-ranked USC women’s golf team charged past Baylor in the second round of the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge yesterday, seizing a commanding lead going into today’s final round of action. The defending national champions were once again led by sophomore Annie Park, who shot her second consecutive 4-under 67 to extend her lead in the individual race.

USC, which followed up a 4-over on Sunday with  a blistering 5-under performance yesterday, sits 14 strokes ahead of crosstown rival UCLA. The No. 2 Bruins turned in scores of 6-over and 7-over in the first two rounds. No. 5 Duke ended yesterday’s action three strokes behind the Bruins, while the unranked Baylor Bears, who took a surprising lead after Sunday’s first round, slipped to fourth place after a disappointing 15-over. USC, UCLA and Duke are three of the four teams that have received first-place votes in the NCAA rankings so far this season. Another Pac-12 foe, the ninth-ranked Arizona Wildcats, rounded out the two-day top five.
USC head coach Andrea Gaston was impressed by her team’s performance given difficult conditions.
“Today we just played very steady and stayed very patient, which we had to be because of the windy conditions,” Gaston told USCTrojans.com. “I told all the girls that on these greens, you have to be patient because of the speed and if you start to force things, you’re going to find yourself with long putts coming back and looking at bogeys or three putts.”
On the individual side, Park holds a commanding advantage going into today’s final 18 holes. Her scores over the past two days have tied a school record for the lowest round at Palos Verdes Golf Course, a course that has previously hosted this event along with the Pac-12 conference tournament. Park made up for three bogeys with five birdies and an eagle yesterday, her second eagle in as many days. The Levittown, N.Y. native has improved steadily since the start of the fall season, with her last result being a season-best second-place finish in the Pac-12 Preview.
It appears that Park’s only competition for the individual crown will come from her classmate Kyung Kim, whose steady scores of 3-under and 2-under have put her in sole possession of second place. Kim might hold the lead herself had she not followed up a hot start to Sunday’s first round with three bogeys over her final five holes. Her 69 today marked her sixth sub-70 round of the season, tying her with Park for the team lead. Also in the individual hunt are Oklahoma’s Alexandra Kaui and Florida’s Sarah Schober, who each sit six strokes off the pace going into Tuesday’s action.
Senior Sophia Popov, who finished the fall season with a pair of top three finishes, followed up a 3-over 74 with an even par 71 in the second round. Her two-day tally is good for a 13th-place tie on the individual leaderboard. Also qualifying for USC was junior Doris Chen, whose 7-over total puts her in 29th place. Freshman Gabriella Then, competing as an individual only, followed up a solid even-par effort on Sunday with a 4-over yesterday. Her total is good for a 17th-place tie.
Gaston was proud of her players’ individual achievements.
“I think they’ve all realized today was a really good day because of the conditions they played in,” she told USCTrojans.com. “This course can really play tough. Now we have to focus on another solid round tomorrow.”
The Women of Troy will attempt to win their fifth straight event to open the 2013-2014 campaign this morning beginning at 8 a.m., extending a school record. At the same time, Park will try to hold off her teammate Kim for the fifth win of her young career.

As the clock ticked down at the Canyonview Complex at the University of California at San Diego Sunday evening, the reigning national champion USC women’s water polo team opened the 2014 season with a perfect weekend.
All in the family · Junior driver Monica Vavic scored a career-high six goals in USC’s first-round game against Sonoma State. The reigning MPSF player of the year has scored 11 goals in the first four games of the 2014 season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC head coach Jovan Vavic’s team captured its second straight Triton Invitational title with an 8-3 victory over No. 5 UC Irvine. En route to the win, freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis posted her second two-goal contest of the tournament — numbers five and six of her young career —  helping the Women of Troy gain a 5-1 lead, despite letting in the first goal of the match.
The freshman’s performance impressed Vavic, which is not an easy feat considering he has won the National Coach of the Year honor 12 times. The 13-time national champion has claimed the award eight times while coaching the men’s team and four with the women’s.
“Stephania scored two huge goals when we needed them the most,” Vavic said. “She’s going to continue to progress. I think she’s going to be outstanding.”
Earlier in the day, the Women of Troy punched their ticket to the finals with a 10-4 win over No. 10 Arizona State, the team they defeated in last year’s Triton championship. Junior two-meter Eike Daube was able to counter ASU attack Izabella Chiappini’s four-goal performance with a hat trick of her own and keep USC afloat.
After demolishing opponents during the first day of the tournament beginning with a spectacular offensive performance Saturday morning, the Women of Troy advanced to the latter rounds on Sunday.
Vavic’s squad kicked off the season with a dominating 26-2 victory over Sonoma State, headlined by last year’s top scorer and MPSF Player of the Year junior driver Monica Vavic’s career-high six-goal performance. The coach’s daughter scored five goals throughout the other three games to bring her total to 11 on the season. Following the brutal beatdown of the Seawolves, the Women of Troy did not let up in the second game of their doubleheader.
Behind the excellent play of three-time All-American senior goalie Flora Bolonyai’s 10 saves in the cage, the Women of Troy registered the sixth shutout in program history during a 13-0 dismantling of No. 16 Cal State Northridge.
“We gave up 10 goals in four games which is absolutely outstanding,” Jovan Vavic said. “Flora was, in my opinion, the best player of the tournament. She looks really confident and really tough to score on.”
The MPSF echoed Jovan Vavic’s sentiment about his star goalie, naming Bolonyai the MPSF Player of the Week following her impressive performance in goal throughout the tournament.
Even though the defense was spectacular throughout the tournament, the offensive distribution was also delightful to see.
Seven different players combined for the 13 Trojan goals during the shutout — four coming from the hand of All-American senior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist.
After a terrific outing to begin the 2014 campaign in San Diego, the Women of Troy return home to prepare for another tournament test next weekend. The reigning national champions will travel to Riverside, Calif. to compete in the Lancer Invitational at California Baptist University.
The team will attempt to continue its success in the pool as they square off with Fresno Pacific in the first game of the tournament on Friday afternoon. The Sunbirds will enter the contest with a dismal 0-5 record, including a 30-1 thrashing by No. 3 Cal at the UCSB Winter Invitational in late January. The Women of Troy put up a similar score last time they played the Sunbirds in 2012, taking home a 27-1 victory.
“If you have a good leadership on the team, the younger players buy in,” Jovan Vavic said. “If you don’t have good leaders, they’re not going to try. We have great leadership on the team.”
The season is just beginning, but for a team stocked with nine new freshmen surrounded by seasoned veterans who understand what it takes to hoist the national championship trophy, things appear to be going swimmingly for Jovan Vavic and his squad.

In addition to the media buzz over Russia’s unfriendly policies toward gay people, the Winter Olympics also presents a biased view of female athletes. Photos of provocatively posed Russian athletes are being used to advertise the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, and went viral soon after their release, according to Slate. Though the website justified these images by reaffirming their support for their team, the decision to focus on female athletes’ figures demonstrates a much bigger problem — the way in which society trivializes female athletes.
Design by Mollie Berg and Isabella Sayyah
These suggestive depictions hurt female athletes’ reputations and lead to less endorsements. A study published in the Journal of Brand Strategy emphasized that risqué depictions of female athletes is linked to the fact that they receive fewer endorsements than their male counterparts do. Though NBC dubbed figure skater Gracie Gold as the face of the Sochi Winter Olympics, she will most likely slip under the radar after the games conclude. The Huffington Post highlighted this point, adding that female athletic events are rarely televised and often occupy less-than-prime time slots. Despite the fact that marketers could argue that Gold is the face of this year’s Olympics, the stylized depictions of the figure skater make it hard for the public to see her as more than eye candy.
Unfortunately, using suggestive photos of women for marketing purposes is nothing new. From cars to fast food, ads regularly use racy images and language to entice consumers to open their pocketbooks. Though this type of hyper-sexualization seems to be the norm, it does not mean that it’s justifiable. Just as airbrushed ads overemphasize women’s bodies, these provocative photos present unrealistic expectations for women involved in sports. The images suggest that it is not enough for women to be Olympic athletes — they must also have supermodel-worthy bodies and exude sex appeal. This emphasis on suggestive marketing is a response to the “female gladiator” stereotype, or the idea that all women in sports are all testosterone-laden and unfeminine, according to Slate. The Russian marketing team picked up on this notion and claims the photos of lingerie-clad athletes show that “[the] Russian Olympic team defies stereotype that women in sport are just a heap of muscles and masculine shapes.” As with all generalizations, the “female gladiator” stereotype not only damages the perception of female athletes, but also encourages female athletes to take provocative photos. The focus should be on presenting a well-rounded depiction of athletes not using cheap marketing tactics as an attempt to advocate for women’s athleticism.
Even though Slate suggests that these provocative photos could help athletes “[come] alive as actual humans to cheer for,” these images objectify instead of humanize the women. After viewing these photo spreads, few people will take the time to research and acquaint themselves with the athletes’ personalities or histories. These pictures present a shallow depiction of the female Olympians and, if anything, make them seem less approachable. Not only are these women world-class athletes, but they also radiate sex appeal and can stand toe-to-toe with lingerie models. In order to “humanize” the athletes, the media should focus on speaking with them and allowing them to tell their narratives.
It is also illogical to equate photos of scantily-clad Olympians as a celebration of their athleticism. Though these athletes definitely deserve to be applauded for their athletic feats, they can be glorified without posing in lingerie. If these images are merely recognition of human achievements, why is it so difficult to find photos of male Olympians posed in a similar manner? Despite the fact that some male Olympians, such as the Italian freestyle skier Christof Innerhofer, pose in underwear ads, these photos are much harder to find and are not being used as marketing tools for the Olympic Games. If these provocative photos of Sochi female athletes truly “celebrate” athleticism, as some claim, there should be equal representation of male and female athletes.
Athletes clearly deserve to be celebrated, but they should be recognized without having to show skin. Yes, the Olympics should be a spectacle — just not the R-rated kind.

Last Thursday, Robert Herjavec, president and CEO of The Herjavec Group and one of the six “sharks” on ABC’s Shark Tank, joined Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Ernest J. Wilson III in an open forum. Though many might assume the tech mogul would be joining the students at the Marshall School of Business, Herjavec instead came to speak to the communication and journalism students about his journey as an entrepreneur.
Herjavec’s decision to visit Annenberg students brought to light a greater question that the university has been addressing for sometime now: How can the various disciplines across the university introduce their students to the world of business and entrepreneurship?
The Annenberg School introduced a Media, Economics and Entrepreneurship initiative that has quickly become one of the most popular undergraduate programs across all schools. Though this program offers students the opportunity to be more exposed to entrepreneurship in the media field, it also includes an additional number of courses that many students might not have the time to complete on top of their demanding major. The solution, therefore, lies in something that is simpler and less of a time commitment. The answer is a business general education requirement.
The university’s general education program is designed to “provide a coherent, integrated introduction to the breadth of knowledge you will need to consider yourself (and to be considered by other people) a generally well-educated person,” according to its website. In a country growing increasingly concerned with a declining market and the fiscal policies of the United States government, it is essential to be able to understand the basic terminology of business and economics in order to keep up with the conversation, hence complying with the GE’s mission statement of creating a “generally well-educated person.” By implementing a business category to the GE requirements, the program can fully live up to its mission.
Not only would a business requirement coincide with the GE program’s mission statement, but also a core business class makes sense for a college student looking to do anything from managing his or her own finances to starting a business. With a range of options from macroeconomics to entrepreneurship, a business GE would allow freedom to explore a side of business that one finds interesting and practical for his or her own life.
Rather than creating a seventh GE category, the university should consider eliminating one of the redundant categories already in place. For instance, two of the six GE categories are “Scientific Inquiry” and “Science and Its Significance.” If the school’s goal is to give students a rudimentary general knowledge, it shouldn’t be necessary to take more than one science class as a non-science major, which would then leave room for a business-focused GE to take its place. In order to be considered a generally well-educated person, as the GE program intends, it is important for students to be exposed to all different subjects, rather than emphasize just two or three as the program currently does.
When news outlets such as Forbes and The New York Times throw business terms such as mutual fund and self-directed 401(k) around, it is important to be able to know what they’re saying — not just for the sake of conversation, but also for the sake of one’s bank account. With the introduction of a business requirement to USC’s ever-changing GE program, students will become more well-rounded and more fiscally responsible.
 
Morgan Greenwald is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. 
 
Get rid of the GE program altogether and replace it with 24 units of required electives.
I can’t speak for all, but as an engineer my major already has a business class requirement.  We all hate it because we’re used to learning actual skills in our classes.
How about an engineering GE? Somehow I think that might make the humanities students cry foul…
Let each student choose his/her general education curriculum and you might find that people will select classes they are actually interested in. Then they might learn something in class besides what their Facebook friends are up to.

This might be a slightly contentious thing to say, but my favorite social media platform is Tumblr. Unlike Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, my real name and personal life does not necessarily need to be attached to Tumblr. In this digital age where everyone is so easily identified online, it’s nice to hold on to some anonymity, a commodity seldom found. Of course, adopting a persona over the Internet calls for healthy online etiquette, which I strive to practice.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
My “board” is filled with whatever gives me inspiration, including fashion, quotes, celebrities and, of course, cats. Something I have been inclined to repost in the past is the infamous “thigh gap,” a term to describe the space between one’s thighs when standing upright with both feet touching.
Everyone has insecurities. There are some things about my body that are not perfect, so Tumblr is a good avenue to give people ideas for a healthier lifestyle. The thigh gap phenomenon, however, took this inspiration to extremes, making me feel extremely vulnerable. When I looked at the space between my thighs and the space between the thighs in the Tumblr post for the first time, I decided which look was definitely more desirable. There was something about Internet affirmation that made the portrayal of that particular body image so much more worthy. This trend even came up in conversations I had with my friends. We had all heard of the thigh gap online or in passing, or have always known about it in the back of our minds. Though we agreed that we would never go to extraordinary lengths to achieve said thigh gap, we all thought society put this trend on a pedestal. Moreover, we thought it was something people unnecessarily obsessed over.
Turns out, obsession is a fitting word. Many users on the Internet communities often post about “thinspired,” and the thigh gap is just a component of the thinspiration train. According to Time, many Tumblr users felt threatened by the “ideal” body posts and were changing their own images that Tumblr had to take precautions to stop the self-harm from circulating further. Scientifically speaking, however, thigh gaps aren’t attainable for everyone. According to the website Fitness Blender, that space is dependent on bone structure, which is impossible to control.
But even knowing this proven fact does not deter me from having thoughts to change my body. I feel as if social media’s stamp-of-approval is the end all, be all of standards. And though my insecurities are not extreme, I wonder how many people out there are starving themselves or bulking up to achieve the body they deem perfect. I wonder how many people were meticulously counting their calories and obsessing over their intake. I wondered if there were options online that showed them a realistic view of body sizes.
Instead of logging onto Tumblr to scroll through my feed, today I went online with the sole intent of looking for body-positive blogs. I found plenty heralding the dimensionality of bodies and celebrities like Lena Dunham, Jonah Hill and Mindy Kaling relaying to their fans what the true meaning of the ideal image is. We need more messages like these in the social media spotlight.
The power that the web holds over people is disheartening, and unfortunately enough to dictate what they should or should not look like, when it’s often uncontrollable. When opinions online come in anonymous hordes, it is hard not to give in to these ideals. There are, as I have found, places on the Internet that celebrate everyone for their natural form. That community should be the one inspiring people everywhere, not the one that points out the inches between the upper thighs.
So, my Tumblr now will have a new message … still with cats, of course.

Hi Danni, I just wrote a blog post on my history with the “thigh-gap”. I appreciate reading your thoughts and share many of them. Thanks for your honesty.

USC Rossier alumnae and sisters Patricia (Patti) Poon and Candace (Candy) Yee and their husbands established last week two endowed scholarships for Rossier students: the James and Candace Chan Yee Endowed Scholarship and the Dudley and Patricia Poon Endowed Scholarship.
The sisters both graduated from the USC Rossier School of Education and went on to become teachers. Poon graduated in 1965 and taught math for 40 years, while Chan graduated in 1968 and received her MS in 1969, according to a press release.
They committed themselves to supporting teachers because, as former teachers, they said they know first-hand the sacrifices young teachers are often forced to make in order to be the best for their students.
“We would go to conferences on the weekends and see these teachers spending their own money for classes so they could do something new and exciting for their students,” Yee said in a release. “They’re paying for their own teaching items and classes because giving to the kids is never-ending. And elementary teachers give so much back to the little kids.”
Poon and Yee are dedicated members of the Trojan family in other aspects as well. The sister are fans of USC sports and say they “bleed cardinal and gold.” In addition to attending as many athletic events as they can, they volunteer at Heritage Hall and donate to both USC Athletics and the Trojan Marching Band.
Yee also runs a blog, Trojan Candy, dedicated to USC sports, featuring profiles of athletes, pictures and commentary on games.
“Most of the time we’re here for all of the sporting activities,” Poon said in a release. “So we started volunteering at Heritage Hall, giving out candy and motherly advice to the athletes, and Candy started taking pictures and interviewing the athletes.”
The Trojan family has become an actual family to the sisters. They said that, as graduates of USC, they feel a responsibility to help support the next generation of Trojans.
“Students are our future,” Poon said in a release. “We’re older so we don’t have any other expenses, but when you’re young, it’s very difficult. That’s why if there is any way you can help, you should support them.”
By supporting the future educators coming out of Rossier, the sisters are hoping to have a much broader impact.
“Our children must be educated and prepared to take over for us in the next generation and beyond, and teachers are the foundation for preparing our children to perform this responsibility,” Yee said in a release. “USC Rossier realizes its responsibility to produce excellent educators, and we are proud to support the school in this goal.”

Milius, shot by directors Joey Figueroa and Zak Knutson, is one of the few documentaries with an ending that must not be spoiled. While other nonfiction films have no room for a climactic twist, this documentary, a look into the life of writer-director John Milius, surprises until the end and stirs emotion throughout its second half.
The documentary spins the story of the larger-than-life Milius, weaving both Hollywood apocrypha and hard facts into its story. Milius, who directed Red Dawn and wrote the screenplay for Apocalypse Now, is a USC School of Cinematic Arts graduate. The libertarian and surfer enjoyed fame and endured infamy in Hollywood, ultimately leading to him leaving the industry in the late ’80s. Milius had close relationships with classmate George Lucas, Apocalypse Now director Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg. All of the cinematic legends offer interviews, turning this film into both a retrospective of Milius’ life and a time capsule for 1970s Hollywood.
The film presents Milius both as the wild man who wanted “girls, gold and guns,” (as he reveals in an interview) and as the romantic intellectual who wanted to recreate, in his words, the “Homeric” on the silver screen. While the first 40 minutes delve into documentary clichés, presenting sentimental home videos and the story of Milius’ time in the Vietnam War, the film picks up when exploring the latter, self-destructive part of his career.
What distinguishes this film from a fluff piece is its candid look at Milius’ persona. In an insightful interview, Lucas says that during their time at USC, Milius’ act was just an act, but Lucas feared that Milius’ comic book persona and personality became indistinguishable. Uncovering the facts of Milius’ life becomes its own adventure, and viewers are often thrust into the thicket of mystery. For instance, Lucas will begin a wild tale about Milius, Spielberg will continue and corroborate it and then Coppola will say it never happened and that the entire story was “written by Milius” to benefit his persona. These contradictions peel away the various layers of Milius’ person to reveal the fascinating, multifaceted writer-director.
To portray Milius’ self-destruction at the hands of his persona, the film must first reaffirm Milius’ legacy. The first 40 minutes exist to reclaim Milius’ spot next to major names such as Robert Zemeckis and Martin Scorsese. During that era, Milius was seen as their equal, but his wild antics have seemingly erased his name from history. The first half, while slow, presents Milius as he is — a genius, capable of rewriting Jaws over the phone and adapting Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Out of necessity, the first 40 minutes feel like fluff in order to present the legend, but they do place Milius back into filmic canon.
By rediscovering Milius, the film also rediscovers the ’70s. Using photos from Coppola’s parties and Lucas’ student films, Milius makes the ’70s feel tangible.
This rediscovery of the ’70s, however, has its drawbacks. Many of those interviewed exhibit the sexism of the era. A particularly problematic line jokes that Milius didn’t write films “for p—ies or women.” While shocking, this candor makes for both a critique of Milius and of the era in which he worked, allowing the viewer to see a bygone era for what it was.
Still, by injecting Milius’ sense of humor into the film, it occasionally glorifies the sexism that Milius casually jokes about. It walks the line between legitimizing Milius’ career and legitimizing his antics, and while the film ultimately critiques him, some moments err on the wrong side.
But what elevates Milius from an interesting rediscovery to a perfect documentary is its ending. The final sequence, marked by intense pathos, has a narrative quality.
Milius had a stroke in 2010. The final scenes include Milius the wordsmith re-learning language after his stroke. This ending provides a climactic edge to the movie, developing a narrative out of a mostly essayistic form. Thus the critique of Milius becomes stronger; even with his deteriorated condition, the filmmakers do not back down from presenting the truth.
When the filmmakers contacted Milius about making the film, he had only one rule: “Tell the truth.” By doing so, an honest film, almost as brilliant as Milius himself, manages to emerge.

Much like the aggressively catchy theme song featured in The Lego Movie, everything was awesome at the box office this weekend for the toy adaptation.
The film managed a phenomenal $69.1M, the second largest February opening ever behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ ($83.85M), and displaced Ride Along’s three-week hold on the No. 1 spot. It also ranks alongside the best-ever openings for an original (non-sequel/prequel) animated film, just behind The Lorax’s $70.2M in 2012.
Released through Warner’s new animation think-tank, the film was able to achieve a level of appeal across all age groups as most people have, at one point or another, played with the tiny building bricks. In recent years, the Lego brand has also expanded into a successful series of video games and a horde of branded lineups such as Lord of the Rings, Marvel Super Heroes and the DC Universe.
That crossover appeal, which the advertisements heavily featuring characters like Batman and Superman, was also a contributing factor and really give the impression that the film was going to be an experience akin to dumping a bucket of Lego characters together and all the fun that entails. It features a compelling animation style, where everything in the film is made of Legos (even the smoke and fire), using a unique mixture of CGI and stop-motion animation that separated it from the pack.
With the giant opening and the near-universal positive review, the film, directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street, should be the first blockbuster of the season, especially with a whole month before the release of Dreamworks’ Mr. Peabody & Sherman as well as a holiday weekend next week. It’s little wonder that Warner Bros., who’ve been oddly absent from the animation arena, is already assembling a sequel.
The Lego Movie wasn’t the only one that did well; acting as counter-programming for adults, The Monuments Men, directed by and starring George Clooney with a grand ensemble including Matt Damon, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett, opened to $22.7M, marking a career best for George Clooney.
Featuring an all-star cast in a story about a WWII platoon attempting to rescue art masterpieces in Nazi Germany, the film was expected to be a cross between Inglourious Basterds and Ocean’s Eleven. It was originally scheduled for Christmas but was delayed to give it more development time as well as avoiding a crowded field.
However, less than stellar reviews seem to show that the film is more dry, almost more of a history lesson than a thrilling caper. Still, its cast and setting should make it appealing for adults for the foreseeable future.
In the latest, and hopefully final, attempt to make the next Twilight, Vampire Academy managed a meager $4.1M, which is worse than any of the young-adult fantasy films that bombed last year (Beautiful Creatures and The Mortal Instruments: The City of Bones both opened to less than $10M, and The Host to $10.6M).  Directed by Mean Girls director Mark S. Waters, it seemed to have a more aloof, self-referential approach to the genre. Sadly, the film’s non-existent marketing campaign and poor reviews has likely put a stake through this film’s heart.
With the failure of the latest young-adult fantasy, Lionsgate has to be a bit skeptical about the upcoming Divergent, although that film has a more compelling plot and cast. Still, the teenage audience that studios are so desperately trying to appeal to are a fickle bunch and it remains to be seen if another Twilight or Hunger Games is waiting in the wings.

Voting — it is one of those tasks that all too often falls into the category of routine chores. Too often, voting seems no more important than taking the car in for an oil change, going to the dentist or picking up the dry cleaning.
In the midst of hectic daily grind, it can seem easy for a task as simple as casting a ballot to slip through the cracks. But a task as crucial to the democratic process as voting should not be pushed off the to-do list.
A vote in an Undergraduate Student Government election might not seem like a civic duty, but it is an important first step. By voting in this USG election, students are acting as members of the USC community. Votes are investments — in this case, in the university and in the future of the student body. Choosing not to vote leaves voices out of the process and removes you from the conversation.
Low turnout rates aren’t only a problem in student government elections. The 2012 presidential election only garnered 58.2 percent of the vote, and the tally was even lower in California. State government elections usually tend to do worse than national elections, and local elections typically draw only between a quarter and a third of registered voters.
This special edition of the Daily Trojan is meant to change that. As reporters and editors who cover student government, we understand the impact student leaders can have on the USC community. The power of student government to enact change on this campus would be immeasurably enhanced if more students paid attention and got involved.
Take this opportunity to participate. Students can vote online from midnight Monday morning to 8 p.m. on Thursday, and USG will have polling stations set up all over campus throughout the week. Visit elections.usc.edu or one of the polling stations on campus and let your voice be heard.

The main role of the Undergraduate Student Government is to serve as the representative body for the undergraduate student population here at USC. The Undergraduate Student Government, also known as USG, is able to do this through the programming of events, advocating for desired changes, funding student organizations and events and writing new legislation for change. To execute and promote these ideals, it requires the work of dedicated students who want to be part of this movement of change. Students are given the opportunity at the beginning of each semester to apply to be part of the USG team by joining advocacy committees such as University Affairs and Diversity Affairs, or funding boards such as the Philanthropy Funding Board or the Discretionary Funding Board. In addition, USG is comprised of elected officials who were chosen in the previous year’s election to represent their various constituency groups such as the Residential, Commuter and Greek Senator positions, and the President and Vice President positions.
This year, to ensure the best possible results for both candidate’s participation and student voter turnout, numerous changes have been made to the Elections Code.
The Elections and Recruitment team took the advice and experience of past candidates and past Elections and Recruitment teams to make changes to the USG Elections Code. The focus of this year’s changes was to increase student participation in the elections both as candidates and as voters as well as improve the elections procedure for candidates, and eliminate gray areas that might cause confusion. One of the major changes made to the elections procedure was the elimination of the “research period.” During this period, candidates were allowed to conduct research by visiting student organizations and other groups on campus in an effort to promote themselves as well as see what platform points to build. During this period, however, candidates were not allowed to disclose their intent to run for any position and also had to include various disclaimers to avoid committing violations. To avoid the confusion that surrounded this period, we removed this period and replaced it with the Campaign Period Part I, which allows candidates to conduct in-person research with student organizations and other groups on campus, but also allowed candidates to disclose themselves as candidates for a certain position.
In addition, this new Campaign Period Part I allowed for candidates to utilize social media and digital forms of campaigning a week and half earlier than previous year’s campaigning periods. This change allows for candidates to advertise their campaign for a longer period of time, garnering more exposure and in turn allowing student voters the opportunity to learn more about the candidates. This change was one of many made to the new Elections Code to make the elections process easier for both the candidates and those in charge of making sure elections is conducted smoothly.
The Undergraduate Student Government holds an influential position on campus and is a tremendous tool for students to utilize for change and advocacy on campus. Given our position as the voice and representation of the undergraduate population, it is important that people take the time to learn about the candidates in this year’s upcoming elections as they might have a direct impact in their undergraduate experience with projected plans. In addition to voting and being aware of the elections, students should explore the opportunity to be part of the Undergraduate Student Government. By being part of this organization, students will have the direct power to invoke changes in the areas they want to see changed. Consider being part of the change by voting in this year’s upcoming elections and also being part of the Undergraduate Student Government as a member.
Fight on!

USC students will take to the polls today to elect Undergraduate Student Government members after a newly-extended campaign period that spanned nearly three weeks — but it’s still unclear whether that prolonged phase will result in increased voter turnout.
Student government elections have become notorious at colleges nationwide for drawing only a small percentage of the student body’s vote, and USC has been no exception in the past few years.
By letting candidates start this year’s campaigns about 10 days earlier than usual via social media, USG’s Elections Committee hoped to ease the pressure on each candidate to cram all their campaigning into a short span while putting academic responsibilities on the backburner.
But USG Co-Director of Elections and Recruitment Andrew Cho said the grander objective of the prolonged campaign was to spark student involvement and give the average student more time to learn about each ticket’s respective platform.
“By having that extra week and a half, each candidate can talk to more organizations and student groups,” Cho said. “Those people that don’t have connections [to the candidates], it’s harder to get them involved in the election process. Hopefully with more exposure we can get them out [to vote].”
Last year’s election, which saw Christian Kurth and Ryan Park defeat Matt Arkfeld and Alex Cascante, brought a record 5,631 students to the polls. That was an increase of less than 100 from the 2012 turnout of 5,546 students, and represented 30.7 percent of USC’s undergraduate enrollment.
“That’s a pretty good number compared to past elections,” Cho said. “Obviously, the goal is 100 percent, but realistically speaking that’s not gonna happen.”
Though Cho admits getting every undergraduate vote is unfeasible, he has set his sights much higher for 2014. Cho hopes that two-thirds of USC’s 18,000-plus enrollment will cast their vote — a feat that would require student participation to more than double. He admits that it’s a lofty goal, but is encouraged by there being three tickets for students to choose from.
“The [president and vice president] positions are important roles, so the fact that the interest is there is really comforting,” Cho said. “The more tickets we have, the more demographics we represent … The closer we can get to [two-thirds participation], the more satisfied we’ll be.”
Some students, however, aren’t sure that mark is attainable — or if it’s even necessary.
“I don’t know if you can do much more than they’ve been doing to get people to vote,” said Hannah Gilden, a senior majoring in communication and Spanish. “I think in the past few years, the results have given a good perception of student opinion.”
USG Senior Director of Communications Olivia Diamond said she expects that the graduating class of 2014 will be the hardest group to convince to participate.
“It’s an election for the year they’re graduating,” Diamond said. “You have to consider entire senior class is a little bit checked out.”
There are certainly some apathetic seniors whom USG will have to inspire in order to achieve their goal of getting more students to vote.
“I am not going to vote,” said Adam Silverman, a senior majoring in business. “Aside from the fact I’m a senior and about to graduate, I’ve never in the last three years felt any direct effect from the president and vice president. If they’ve done anything to help or hurt me, they haven’t made it well-known.”
There are others, however, who believe that USG plays a crucial role in continually improving the university.
“I think it’s very important to participate in the elections,” said James Shechet, a senior majoring in business and cinematic arts. “I’m planning on voting in a way that prioritizes [the class of 2014] leaving USC in the best hands possible.”
USG hopes that there are more students who view the election in that light — as an invaluable process that will benefit from having as much input as possible.
And to obtain that input, USG will attempt to attract students to the polls by appealing to their stomachs — every polling day will bring a different food vendor to campus, with free food at each of the voting stations from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Voters will receive Jamba Juice on Monday, In-N-Out on Tuesday, Sprinkles Cupcakes on Wednesday and Amazebowls on Thursday.
There are some signs that student interest in the election could be higher than in previous years — Wednesday night’s debate between the three tickets was heavily attended, with some students relegated to sitting on the floor. Others, however, took the more skeptical view and said the debate was superfluous because of the information that has been readily available on the Internet for weeks.
“[Last year] I stayed for one round and realized they basically reiterate campaign points over and over again,” said Allegra Bishop, a sophomore majoring in environmental science and health. “I mostly [decide] by looking online and seeing how realistic their points are … I think starting [to put campaign platforms online] earlier is definitely a good idea because I feel like in the past it has come up really fast, and that makes it more of a popularity contest.”
Whether students dub elections a “popularity contest” or take them seriously, Cho said USG’s job remains the same — to give students the opportunity to cast their vote. Voting starts today and continues through Thursday.

This year, students campaigning for Undergraduate Student Government offices are required to play by a new set of rules. A revised elections code changed the campaign process and extended the voting period. 
The revised code established a preparation period between Dec. 19 and Jan. 21, where the candidates could only speak to their running mate and five other individuals whom they listed as affiliated with the campaign. The changes to the Election Code also split the campaign period into two parts.
The first period, which lasted from Jan. 22 to Feb. 3, allowed candidates to promote themselves and their platforms on social media and attend meetings of official organizations to discuss their platforms. Candidates, however, were prohibited from distributing any physical materials.
The second phase of the campaign, which began on Feb. 4 and ends on Feb. 13, allows for distribution of physical materials such as pamphlets and t-shirts, endorsements and campaigning on Trousdale Parkway. The voting period now extends from Feb. 10 to 13.
Asher Genoot, USG’s Assistant Director of Elections and Recruitment, said the changes to the Elections Code helps the candidates save on campaign costs because they have more time to prepare materials and do not have to expedite shipping. It also gives candidates a chance to speak with students in specific schools who might feel under represented.
“Our goal this year [was] to make the elections as straightforward as possible, make them understandable and, in terms of voting, to reach out to as many voters in as many schools — to reach out to the entire student body,” Genoot said.
Genoot also said when determining the changes the Elections and Recruitment team spoke with the elections commission — a group of non-USG students — as well as candidates and elections teams from previous years. Genoot said candidates have had few complaints thus far — a fact that he attributes to the newly established timelines within the election code.
“There is no room for opinion and there is no room for ‘maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,’” Genoot said. “I think all the candidates understand what we did and are listening to the rules and the timelines we set.”
The revised code also stipulates that members of the Judicial Council and Elections and Recruitment team must relinquish their position if they wish to run for elected office. This situation has not previously occured, but Genoot said the revised code aims to eliminate ambiguity and provide answers to any questions that might arise. It also outlines a specific list of pre-determined infractions.
Presidential candidate Andrew Menard said though he believes that the changes in the code were intended to help candidates, they have made campaigning more difficult in some areas.
“The social media week was intended to make it a little easier on the candidates by not allowing physical campaigning during that time and encourage us to not miss as much class,” Menard said. “When you’re campaigning, you’re a full-time campaigner and it can be really difficult to stay on top of school. You want to reach out to as many students as possible [and] hear as much of student issues as you possibly can.”
But Menard said because the campaign process is now longer, the overall campaign is more taxing and the strict time constraints make reaching out to students more difficult.
“I wish we were allowed to talk to more students then just five over winter break because that would really enable us to be more prepared and get more feedback from students in a time where we’re not also trying to balance school,” he said. “Now, from Jan. 22 to Feb. 13, you have to try and reach out to all 17,000-plus students, and that’s really hard to do in a month.”
Though residential senatorial candidate Aziz Akbari is running his first campaign, he said the addition of a social media week makes sense in the increasingly digital age. Akbari said the extended campaign time has taken some of the pressure off of candidates because they have more time to do the same amount of campaigning as in previous years. Akbari explained that his campaign now relies on monitoring the success of its online outreach.
“I think that’s been really beneficial for me because most people spend a large portion of their day online, especially with social media like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram,” Akbari said. “So if you’re able to get your name out a little bit earlier, get people talking about you — it’s been really helpful and we’ve been able to track how many people have seen our posts and how many people are actually paying attention to what we put out there.”
Greek senatorial candidate Providence Illisevich said the new rules taught her to use each allotted time period to her advantage.
“I think before [the revised code] it was kind of like a sprint and now its like a marathon,” Illisevich said. “There’s a decision you have to make if some people are going to try to run the marathon like a sprint — it’s all about pacing.”
Illisevich also said that because social media is a user-driven medium and people have the opportunity to repost things, it gives candidates more time to interact with their constituency and allows constituents to take a closer look at candidates’ platforms.

Signs on Trousdale. Profile and cover photos on Facebook. Student organization endorsements. What many see as a fierce competition raging on between factions of the student body is inspiring a very different kind of emotion in two students on campus — nostalgia.
“It’s weird seeing it from the other end,” said Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Ryan Park. “You know what they’re going through, and you know how stressed out and anxious and crazy they’re making themselves right now.”
The altered viewpoint is not necessarily a bad thing, however.
“It’s nice to see it from the other end, because we’re a little more relaxed now,” USG President Christian Kurth said.
Looking back on their campaign, Kurth and Park had some ambitious platform points, but they believe they have made a significant dent in them.
“I firmly believe that we’ve accomplished five or six very large items on our platform that I haven’t seen other tickets accomplish,” Kurth said.
During their administration, Kurth and Park established a farmer’s market on campus, fixed the sidewalks on 28th Street, increased sustainability awareness through the new Environmental Student Assembly and brought back the LA Live shuttle.
Other accomplishments, however, were less planned. Kurth believes the high number of alcohol-related transports and incidents that occurred last semester led to USG developing better relationships with the administration to deal with cultural issues on campus.
“What I’ll be most proud of at the end of the day is how our [USG] administration has fixed that dynamic,” he said. “The administrators, they can say they care about [the student voice], but for them to actually be willing to come and work with us on things [is new].”
Park agreed that if the two do leave a legacy at USC, it would be improved communication and cooperation between USG and the university administration.
“USC’s known for ‘work hard, play hard,’ but it will also be one of those work hard, play hard, but also get along with the administration,” he said. “Honestly I think that would be the coolest thing, to [have had] a hand in creating a culture both the administration and the students can agree upon and something they can both enjoy.”
Kurth and Park’s collaboration with the administration led to a new social events policy that allows programming on weekdays, as well as events at which alcohol is present on Thursdays.
“The policy changes, 1992 was when they were created, and they hadn’t been touched since,” Park said. “The school has become super different since then; we’re not a commuter school anymore. We’re a totally different community so it was awesome to be able to have a hand in changing the way in which the university and students come together and collaborate.”
Though much of the student attention has been concentrated on how this will affect their social lives, Kurth said the policy extends beyond The Row.
“It allows people to celebrate Chinese New Year. It allows the Chess Club to have a tournament later,” he said. “This isn’t just a huge Greek issue.”
The two said they plan on continuing working with the administration on alcohol-related policies including alcohol education in their remaining two months in office. When it comes time to turn over the reins on April 1, however, the two believe the school will remain in good hands.
“I’m very happy to know that all the candidates have USG experience, multiple years in most cases,” Kurth said. “I feel comfortable handing this off to any of them. But, it is going to be a really fun, close, tough race.”
Kurth and Park have both attributed their own positive experience to the university itself.
“There’s something called the USC experience, which is very hard to articulate, put in words. It’s different for everyone,” Kurth said. “But, once you’re here, you feel it, you do it … If I could bottle it and sell it I would, but I don’t know what it is.”
As for their future past USC, both have jobs lined up, Kurth will work in investment banking at Wells Fargo while Park will work in sales at the startup BrightEdge.
“I think the best years of our lives are still to come,” Park said. “This is just the beginning and USC has definitely equipped us with the tools and opportunities to make the most of what’s out there.”
