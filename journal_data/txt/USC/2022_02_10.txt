When roommates Emma Fidler and Devon Sieving moved into their apartment near USC in August, they found a unit with quirks and poor living conditions — a fridge that knocks into their oven when opened, a kitchen that only fits one person at a time and a bedroom completely devoid of natural light.
Fidler, a senior majoring in health and human sciences, and Sieving, a senior majoring in human biology, have laughed about their apartment’s quirks since, and after a few months, decided to film a TikTok documenting the apartment’s conditions “as a joke.”
At first, the video didn’t gain much traction — Sieving said it only accummulated six views when she went to bed that night, most of them from her and Fidler. But when Sieving woke up the next morning, the video had started circulating more widely.
“I looked on TikTok, just randomly. I was like, ‘Oh, I just want to watch the video again,’ and I think it had around 25,000 views,” Fidler said. “I jokingly texted Devon, and I was like, ‘Devon, we’re famous.’”
Now, with more than 12 million views and one million likes, the girls have an audience following every update about their apartment. 
“We obviously could have never expected it to get to this point that it is now,” Fiddler said.
Fidler and Sieving had to find new housing after a prior housing fallout last summer, and found the apartment they live in in June and signed immediately. While they had seen photos of a similar unit before moving in, they had not seen the exact apartment they eventually moved into.
The roommates spoke about the difficulty of finding apartments in the USC area, as most apartments are rented out quickly or are too expensive. According to RENTcafé, a housing rental website, the average rental cost in University Park is $4,263, the second most expensive in L.A. Historic South Central, also near USC, has the third highest rent at $4,212.
Fidler and Sieving said they don’t know if their landlord’s company has seen the viral video, but they asked for an apartment remodeling after learning their bathroom had mold a few days after their first video — and they stayed in a hotel with all expenses paid, which is all documented on Fidler’s TikTok account.
Through the experience, the roommates said they learned to use their voices to advocate for themselves.  
“What we’ve realized throughout this is to always speak up,” Fidler said. “They’re remodeling our bathroom and making it a nicer place for us to live for the next three months or ’till the end of our lease.”
The roommates continued making TikToks for their audience with updates on the apartment saga, reading comments such as “is it worth it besties?” and “this is why I live in Pittsburgh” by Duolingo, a popular language-learning app that trended on TikTok. Fidler and Sieving said they will continue making videos on their terms.
“As long as it’s fun for us and as long as people want to see,” Sieving said. “Hopefully when it’s remodeled, there will be a lot less content able to be made.” 
Fidler said that it has been fun reading the comments, support and kindness from viewers throughout the journey. Specifically, Sieving said she remembers one user’s comment on a video about the roommates not having heat for part of December. 
“We said that we got into a heated argument with our landlord. A viewer said ‘at least something got heated,’” Sieving said. “I thought that was hysterical.”
Fidler and Sieving look forward to making more TikToks and have been happy to bring joy to peoples’ days by showing their apartment’s quirks. Hopefully, they said, after their apartment’s renovation — their TikToks can be about something else.
Fiddler and Sieving’s landlord declined to provide comment to the Daily Trojan.

USC Dornsife’s Center for the Political Future posed the question, “Is California Still a Golden State?” at a webinar Wednesday, held in partnership with Govern for California, to discuss the impact of state policies and the rhetoric surrounding California residents exiting the state in recent years.
This discussion was held between Govern for California president and Stanford University lecturer David Crane and former California State Treasurer, State Controller and Fall 2020 Fellow for CPF John Chiang. The event was moderated by CPF director Bob Shrum and co-director Mike Murphy.
CPF hosts the Political Conversations series under the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ political science and international relations department and has partnered with more than 50 other organizations both on and off-campus to present students with diverse perspectives in these civil discussions. Govern for California, the partner organization for Wednesday’s event, is a political philanthropist network with chapters throughout the state that support candidates for state legislature deemed capable of winning their elections and willing to govern in accordance with their constituents.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, CPF Executive Director Kamy Akhavan said he hopes the event provided some perspective to the questions of whether “our state is on the rise or on the decline.” Akhavan said the question on the minds of moderators and attendees is whether state policies or people’s preferences are causing the changes that California is currently undergoing, such as the increase in the state’s unhoused population, companies, such as Tesla, moving out of the state and the upward trend of residents leaving. 
“What we’re trying to do is to bring the rigor of USC as an academic institution and combine it with practical politics,” Akhavan said. “We can have civil dialogue and look to find solutions to our society’s real world problems — not theoretical solutions, but actual solutions from people who are working in the field, and all our events are geared to deliver those outcomes.”
As the conversation began, Crane was the first to directly answer the question of if California is still a golden state, saying “the answer is undoubtedly, yes.” 
“The reason that California has become less well-governed than it used to be; part of it is this dramatic growth, and probably the most complex population in the country, if not the world,” Crane said.
Much of the conversation in the webinar followed this two-pronged approach. The speakers expressed a general reverence toward California and acknowledged the massive amounts of revenue generated by the state but also acknowledged the misutilization of this wealth in services like education and Medi-Cal.
“5.9 million kids are in California public schools, and despite a doubling in spending per pupil over the last decade, not only is performance no better, but their lives are worse,” Crane said. “We’ve got nearly 15 million people on Medi-Cal who have greater access, but they don’t have better health, necessarily.” 
Crane said he attributes this observation to the monopolization of the education code and poor incentives for hospitals to provide improved healthcare services, despite having higher operating earning margins.
Shrum said a large source of this revenue is California’s state income taxes, which are the highest in the nation, along with the state’s exceptionally high sales tax. 
“A lot of people allege that this is driving residents and businesses out of the state,” Shrum said.
In response, Chiang said that while high taxes might contribute to some people leaving the state, other factors — such as high housing, living costs and other services — are larger contributors. 
“It was the difficulty of retaining staff here because of the cost of housing, the cost of living, the transportation that some of the school districts that their kids went to weren’t the highest performing,” Chiang said. “We still have to do a better job in regards to providing services.”
Crane, on the other hand, said the reason for much of California’s shortcomings comes down to the idea that California has “largely been dominated by special interests.” If the state legislature were better protected against special interests, he said, “California can be golden again.”
Crane said that Gov. Gavin Newsom would pass pension reform and increase postemployment benefits — two progressive policy priorities —  if he believed the state legislature would vote for it, but that he can’t without its support.
Aaron Goode, an attendee of the event, said that though he enjoyed the event, he had hoped the speakers would talk more about other “governance-related issues pertaining to California,” such as campaign finance reform and public financing of elections. 
“[The webinar] avoided some of the extreme characterizations of California that you sometimes hear in the media,” Goode said. “California — it’s not a paradise, but it’s not a dystopian hellscape either, so I thought they threaded the needle there very nicely, and it was a good mix of panelists.”
The Center for the Political Future hosts similar events every week, featuring a diverse range of elected officials, journalists and political experts. Akhavan said he hopes students, faculty and staff continue to engage with the center, which he said aims to “train and develop the next generation of civic leaders.”  
“Students can hear diverse voices, interact with them, learn from them and then go off into the world with their opinion muscles, fully flexed and developed,” Akhavan said.

One would’ve thought that when the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers played in the NFC Championship before the Super Bowl that most of the news would be focused on that historical matchup. Yet, the fact that coronavirus is still the most prevalent issue in daily life, it reminds the public that there’s no escaping this pandemic unless government officials and the public get on the same page to work in unison.
The viral images of some of our cities’ and states’ most powerful elected representatives, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti and other state leaders, photographed in multiple social media posts posing with luminaries such as Magic Johnson huddled together, maskless, with great big smiles of enthusiasm, had major reverberations for Angelenos. 
It should not be lost on us that the hypocrisy and entitlement of elected officials that spend hours at press conferences urging the public to follow rules, stay home and refrain from social activity are partying it up, mask free, in sky boxes with champagne, taking selfies with superstars.
Perhaps the intended purpose of the posts was to signal that the state and the city were getting out of the pandemic — a sign of normalcy, an image to project optimism for a future in which many can gather maskless without having to worry about the risk of infection.
In truth, it projects a far different message: the rules don’t apply to those at the top; those who govern and the governed live in separate worlds. The public was asked to stay home because of the Omicron variant, schools were shut down and once again, the all-too-familiar recommendation to stay away from large gatherings rang out. Yet, elected officials chose to do the opposite of what they preached, further damaging their already broken reputation and credibility.
To make matters worse, Garcetti and Newsom did nothing to walk back their blatant disregard for their own protocols. Newsom, who early on in the pandemic was globally criticized for dining indoors in a Michelin starred restaurant in Napa Valley while hospitals were overwhelmed, stated that he participated in the photo sessions because he felt the need to be “gracious.” Perhaps it would be best to put graciousness aside and act bravely — be brave enough to say no to multimillionaire donors and stand up for the laws that bear one’s own signature. 
Garcetti’s defense was even more laughable, as he was quoted saying, “When people ask for a photograph, I hold my breath … There is a zero percent chance of infection from that.” That type of snarky elitism suggests that his action was justifiable, and his reasoning ignores the fact that it creates a public relations nightmare and assumes the public is ignorant enough to buy such a story. Elected officials should try something new for a change: to back down when they get caught with egg on their face, rather than simply digging themselves deeper into a more laughable and hypocritical hole.
For students in particular, this has a more salient ramification. The last two years have been nothing less than a non-ending roller coaster for students. Be that kindergarteners, high schoolers or college students, the lasting damage the two years in a pandemic has caused cannot be undone. 
Students have gone through enough trying to create a bearable environment for themselves amid constant pressures to stay safe, to ensure that they can learn with such arduous protocols and precautions and that they themselves do not break the rules, only for the rulemakers to suddenly turn and laugh in their faces. It makes students wonder whether all this effort and suffering was worth it, for it seems that those pressures and hardships of the pandemic are worth nothing for a governor or mayor who want to have fun at a football game.
This Sunday, the Super Bowl will still take place at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium at full capacity.The fact that the Super Bowl will continue exactly as planned reinforces what the photo a week before shed light on: that big money interests, the whims of the powerful and rich and the desire to project normalcy in the face of a much harsher reality override the actual safety of citizens. 
It begs the question: at what point does public opinion take precedence over economic revenue and catering to the rich and powerful? The games on Sunday will simply send another message of tone deafness and hypocrisy. 
It is indeed tragic that over two years into this pandemic, the flouting of rules by elected officials continues to be one of the most prevalent acts in our society. The public is unified in outrage and disgust, but the question is when that contempt for such blatant and overt hypocrisy will boil over and cause far greater damage than a Twitter outcry. Next time, Gavin and Garcetti, don’t take the picture.

I really don’t remember the first time my grandma gave me coffee. I just know that there is no one else on this planet who makes it like her.
Whenever the kids at school scrunched their noses and said they hated coffee, or their parents didn’t let them drink it, or they’ve never had it before, I often felt pity for them. How could you not drink instant coffee with whole milk and at least two scoops of sugar? That’s how my grandma, my abuelita in Spanish, made it growing up.
It feels fitting then that this column’s name would be a tribute to the woman who, without knowing how to read or write herself, made sure I made it to the one place she never had the opportunity to step into. Married at a young age and molded by years of war, labor and grief, abuelita never thought twice about her lack of formal education — what mattered was that her descendants had a chance to strive for more.
After I walked the stage at my high school graduation, abuelita hugged me tightly and cried into my shoulder outside of the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium. I didn’t need to speak to her to understand the gravity of the situation — and, regardless, I wasn’t able to form many words because I was also crying. She took a moment to look at me dressed in my cap and gown, and in that moment, abuelita and I stood generations apart, but tethered together.
I think about that memory a lot. In part, I owe so much of my education to my abuelita because I was largely raised by her. She braided my hair in the morning, stood by the porch to make sure I made it to school safely and had food hot and ready for me when I came back. When my parents woke up at 4 a.m. to head off to work and would return in the evening with tired faces and exhausted bodies, it was abuelita who cared for me and gave me bread and coffee, or pan y café in Spanish.
In the memories I have with her, such as holding her wrist so she can form a shaky “X” as a signature or sitting alongside her during emergency room visits so I could be her translator, I stood in awe at the strength with which she carried herself. There was no shame in her resolve, only resilience personified, which makes me wonder who she could have been under different circumstances that hadn’t forced her to uproot her life time and time again. 
My mom often tells me that one of the reasons we immigrated from Guatemala was because she wanted to see me do more than get married and have kids at a young age. Girls’ education is scarce in Guatemala, often in part due to patriarchal attitudes and poverty that result in many young girls being barred from academia.
My mom has never let me forget this, and upon reflecting on how much my education meant to abuelita, I’ve never been able to shake off the pressure that attending college meant I served as an extension of my mom and abuelita’s unanswered dreams. This exacerbated the emotions I already had of not feeling like I belonged at USC because I felt like my place in this University was drastically different from my peers with intergenerational legacy status.
Whenever events such as Trojan Family Weekend came around and I would see groups of students whose parents, grandparents or great-grandparents came to USC, it was hard to push down all my jealousy and sadness. I longed for a traditional college experience where I could relate to those families, where I could count on abuelita to give me stories about her years in college. But in the end, I’ve come to realize that I have something better because I have her. 
My USC journey has often been about making abuelita proud and reaching accomplishments in honor of her, and while I’ve sometimes forgotten along the way what that has personally meant to me, I can’t deny that it hasn’t been an anchor that has guided me these past four years. I think of her courage often when I’m struggling, and I think of her strength when I feel hopeless.
Writing a column such as this one was always something I wanted to do since I got to USC but have never had the courage to do so. I deeply admired and outright envied those who so easily and so proudly attached themselves to writing about their passions, but I found that to be a vulnerable position I didn’t want to step into.
But I realize now that these experiences do matter, and writing about them makes me feel a bit less lonely. Plus, abuelita would want me to share this with you all as she is the best storyteller that I know. 
And soon this story will finish in its entirety, as I count down the days until commencement so I can hug abuelita once again.

No. 1 women’s water polo will travel to San Diego this weekend for the annual Triton Invitational. USC faces off against No. 16 UC Santa Barbara and No. 13 Long Beach State on Saturday and play two more matches Sunday.
The Trojans haven’t skipped a beat since their 2021 NCAA title season, and aside from a shaky fourth quarter against now-No. 8 Fresno State, they’ve won all four games in comfortable fashion. While they haven’t encountered ranked opponents yet, the early season has been a good opportunity for the Trojans to work on team chemistry and communication. 
“I think everybody’s been quick to adapting to certain situations so I think that’s really helpful,” senior utility Bayley Weber said. “Everyone’s coachable, which is also making the transition very smooth.”
While the team’s early performances prove promising the players know that they can’t force anything — it will take time for the team to mesh completely.
“Right now, [the team’s chemistry is] good, but there’s a lot of work to be done,” redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns said. “With 10 freshmen coming in, and then myself and [redshirt junior driver] Paige Hauschild — we’ve been gone for two years — and came back and we have an integral part to play. It’s still building.”
The Trojans have a specific goal each week for execution in the pool. For this tournament, Head Coach Marko Pintaric challenged his squad to limit teams to under 6 goals a game. Through the first four games, USC is conceding 5 goals per game, so Pintaric looks to see clean defensive execution in an invitational with multiple ranked teams.
“[We want to] improve the mistakes that we did have —mainly bad timing — and communication,” Pintaric said. 
Weber and redshirt sophomore driver Alejandra Aznar will serve as defensive anchors. Weber spoke about emphasizing constant communication with the starting goalie — likely junior Carolyne Stern — and organizing team formations. Meanwhile, Aznar comes off a four-steal game against San José State. The two are poised to make meaningful contributions on the defensive end that may not pop up in the box score.
Pintaric will travel with 19 players to the Triton Invitational. Four games in two days will likely mean that all of them will get time in the pool, but the head coach is prepared to shorten the rotation.
“As the season goes further and further, and you start playing in order to actually win, we will start trimming down,” Pintaric said. “[Now, we are] trying to see what our best rotations are for incoming tough matches.”
Pintaric is looking down the line to early May, when the NCAA tournament will be held in Michigan. He stresses focusing on taking things one step at a time, and most importantly, his team buying into the same vision.
“It’s pretty easy to keep motivation high here playing in this system at USC,” Kearns said. “Everything’s so well thought out and planned … when there’s 27 other girls that are doing the same thing as you, all working towards a natty.”
USC plays No. 16 UC Santa Barbara at 9:20 a.m. and No. 13 Long Beach State at 1:20 p.m. Saturday.

Amelia Brodka is one of USC’s greatest trailblazers.
The pro skateboarder’s legacy is remarkable and should make her one of the most celebrated athletes to graduate from USC. Yet, the average USC sports fan has probably never heard of her. 
So, how has an icon gone unnoticed? 
Her achievements should command our attention. A skateboarder since she was 12 years old, Brodka started competing in professional skateboarding events in 2007 while she attended USC. Ever since then, she has ranked well in international vert, park and bowl competitions. She is a two-time winner of the European Park Championships in 2017 and 2018. Most remarkably, she qualified for the women’s park event at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games, representing her home country of Poland. In doing this, she became the first USC alumna to ever compete in the Olympics for skateboarding. 
Her achievements in competition are enough to cement her status as one of USC’s most iconic athletes. However, her achievements in the greater sports world are even more impressive. 
Brodka’s senior thesis was one of the most impactful in USC’s history. Her short film, “Underexposed: A Women’s Skateboarding Documentary,” shined a light on gender disparities within skateboarding and won awards at multiple film festivals. 
In 2012, the same year she graduated from USC, Brodka founded Exposure Skate, a nonprofit organization that attempts to expand the space for women in skateboarding by empowering female skaters and providing them more opportunities to compete. 
Within the first few years of the organization’s existence, Exposure created the world’s largest women’s skateboarding event, Exposure: A Women’s Benefit Event, which remains one of the largest skateboarding events to this day with more than 170 women and girls participating annually. The event’s proceeds go towards ending domestic violence. 
Exposure also holds free monthly events for girls from ages four to 18, where attendees focus on a community service initiative before a skating clinic. Last year, Brodka also founded an Exposure College Scholarship program, inspired by her belief in the importance of higher education like the one USC provides. 
So, Brodka has carved up the skatepark and carved out a place for women in a traditionally male-dominated sport. She is one of the biggest icons in all of women’s sports and a leader for women’s rights. 
So, why hadn’t you known about her before reading this article? 
The answer is the exact same reason that Brodka has fought tooth and nail to give female skaters a platform. 
Brodka, like most women skaters, has dealt with being overlooked by her male peers long before she was an Olympian. Women are often shunned in the traditionally male-dominated sport of skateboarding, and Brodka isn’t a stranger to excessive male intimidation. 
Due to its dangerous nature, skating has long been seen as a sport for men, fueled in part by stereotypes about the increased physical toughness of men compared to the supposed physical weakness of women, which quietly led to a “boys’ club-esque” culture that permeates throughout the sport. Women have had little opportunity to prove that skateboarding was for them too.
Until recently, at least. Until Brodka. 
The number of women skaters has increased drastically, coinciding with the emergence and success of Brodka and many other successful women skaters. 
Brodka has proven that she is physically and mentally tougher than all the boys who used to make her feel unwelcome at the skatepark. She has endured the physical toll of skateboarding and the mental abuse of naysayers with an unmatched grace and fire and has fought to ensure that other women and girls don’t have to endure the difficulties she did as one of the first women to professionally compete in a “boys’ club” of a sport. 
Yet, the biases against women skateboarders still exist, and they are still very prominent in the minds of sports fans. That is why, despite all of her achievements in the sport of skateboarding, Brodka is not a household name in the minds of sports fans. 
We shouldn’t forget one of the most impactful women’s athletes in the world. Luckily, we don’t have to. We can address our unconscious biases against women in skateboarding and recognize Brodka as the icon that she is. 
Members of the Trojan Family and the greater sports world, I implore you to pay attention the next time that our own Amelia Brodka competes or her organization runs an event. She is a showstopper in one of the most extreme and entertaining sports on the planet. 
And, just by paying attention, you’re helping fight for gender equality and redefine an entire sport. How cool is that?

When February rolls around, it may seem like everyone you know is dating someone. That Valentine’s Day FOMO is real — we know. 
Though it may seem like all your friends have significant others, the truth is a majority are still single and ready to mingle. If you’re stumped on what you and your other single friends can do while everyone’s out to fancy dinners, we got you covered.
Host a singles’ dinner
Invite some of your closest friends over and cook some dinner together or set up some kind of speed dating mixer where you can meet other like-minded singles. Whether you’re hosting a platonic dinner party with your friends or a mix and mingling party with local singles, you’re sure to have a fun night in.
Make some chocolate covered strawberries
Pick up some strawberries and chocolates from your local market, melt down the chocolates, and dip in the berries. Pop them in the fridge for a bit and you’ll have a delicious snack to distract you from your loneliness, or invite a friend over and enjoy them together — then at least you won’t be alone. Remember, even if you’re sad that you’re single, chocolate still tastes good, so there’s that.
Binge some anti-Valentine’s Day movies
For those of you who are truly mad at all the love and cheer and “mushy gushy” romance around this holiday, you can binge-watch some movies that will actually make you glad you’re single. You can even turn it into an anti-Valentine’s Day party! The more haters, the merrier!
Here’s some movie suggestions to suck the romance right out of Valentine’s Day: “The Lobster” (2016), “Gone Girl” (2014) and “It Follows” (2014).
Stay off of social media
It can be tempting to scroll through Instagram and TikTok all day, but knowing all of your coupled up friends will be posting pictures and romantic quotes, it might be best to save the browsing for later in the week. FOMO is hard, but it’s even harder when it looks like everyone has something you don’t. Spare yourself the jealousy by turning off your phone and remind yourself that it just looks that way because people who aren’t in relationships probably won’t post as much on Valentine’s Day.
Have a self-care night in
The absolute best thing you can do for a truly solo Valentine’s Day is take care of yourself, and that includes both mental and physical health. Run yourself a bath, get squeaky clean, do your full skincare routine, meditate a bit and do whatever it takes to make yourself feel refreshed and ready to take on the rest of your week. Valentine’s Day is all about love, and above everything, you need to be able to love yourself.
Get some fellow singles and try an escape room
Escape rooms can be super fun, scary and exciting — just like a night spent swiping through Tinder. You can book a room with a bunch of your single friends, and you’ll be so distracted solving puzzles, you won’t even remember that it’s Valentine’s Day. 
60Out, located at 2284 South Figueroa Street by The Lorenzo, is a great local option — I just don’t recommend one of the horror-themed rooms if you’re easily scared.
Try cooking a new recipe
Every night can be a new opportunity to practice your cooking skills, but maybe there’s a more extensive recipe you’ve been looking to try and just haven’t had the time for yet. Valentine’s Day could present the perfect evening opportunity to take the time to learn a new dish — and treat yourself to a romantic meal.
Have a game night
Invite your closest friends and distract yourselves with games, snacks and laughter. What better kind of love is there than the love of close friends and silly games? Jackbox Party Packs in particular have a lot of fun games you can play with larger and smaller groups.
Exercise to exorcize anger
Those of you who have so much pent-up rage about not having a partner on Valentine’s Day might want to do something about it before you explode. Working out can be a super healthy outlet for any upset or uneasy feelings surrounding this holiday. Exercise has been scientifically proven to release serotonin in the brain, so go on a run if you’re feeling up to it.
If you’re in quarantine or choose to spend your time alone, there are still ways for you to have fun this Valentine’s Day. Having a significant other doesn’t define you, and there will be plenty of opportunities for you to enjoy this holiday differently in the future if this year isn’t going your way. No matter what you choose to do with your day, have a safe and healthy Valentine’s Day experience.

The experiences of people with disabilities are left out of mainstream media, left out of discussions about marginalized communities and, most surprisingly, not taught within educational institutions. This problem did not come to my attention until I came across the community of creators with disabilities on TikTok. 
TikTokers with disabilities have used the app to educate people about the inaccessibility they face and spread awareness for work that needs to be done to improve their everyday experiences. Not only that, creators with disabilities have also used the platform to build a community, something that is so often not present in other forms of media. 
My first encounter with creators with disabilities on TikTok came from Mya Pol (@immarollwithit), a student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who makes videos describing transportation and travel as a wheelchair user. 
For instance, in one TikTok, Pol visits home during winter break. Since her home is not accessible, she has to stay in a hotel and travel to her parents’ house. However, there are other transportation issues. Taxis, Ubers and Lyfts do not have accommodations for people with disabilities, and public transportation has limited appropriate stops. Thus, Pol has to roll from her hotel to her parents’ house.
Pol puts it best when she said, “Lack of accessible transportation contributes to the exclusion of disabled people … Many people are put in the situation where we’re forced to literally roll through the streets, in our wheelchairs. It’s not safe, it’s not humane . . . We can do better and should do better.”
Unfortunately, the barriers do not stop there. The sidewalks — very much like those around USC — are uneven and quite dangerous and difficult for wheelchair users to maneuver. In just one short video, Pol gave users a firsthand account of some of the transportation issues that exist for wheelchair users like herself. 
She brings awareness to the need for more readily available and affordable transportation options — ones that do not cost $70k, such as the wheelchair-accessible vans Pol mentions. 
Similarly, a creator named Spencer West (@spencer2thewest) shared similar transportation issues regarding snow and sidewalks. Fortunately, the sidewalks were shoveled so that he can safely use his wheelchair outside of the streets. But, the ramp, which he needs to use to get off the sidewalk to cross the street, was blocked with a pile of snow. 
Rightfully filled with frustration and disappointment West said, “Dear cities and allies, if you cannot continue to create more barriers for us, that would be great. If there’s a cut out in a curb, it is there for a reason, we need it, so please don’t pile your snow or park it in front of it.”
He is correct, there are a plethora of barriers that exist for people with disabilities and, oftentimes, more are unknowingly and carelessly created. 
In contrast to Pol and West, an influencer with disabilities who has been on the internet for many years is Molly Burke (@mollyburkerofficial). A blind Youtuber and motivational speaker, Burke makes a lot of videos explaining the work her guide dog does and how he assists her. 
Her guide dog, Bennix, is always by her side, and Burke creates amazing videos openly and answers questions about what exactly Bennix does. These videos are great educational tools for people who genuinely want to learn anything, from the hand gesture commands Bennix uses to how he can put on his harness on his own. 
Similar to Burke’s guide dog, Mabel the service dog (@servicebearmabel) and her owner have created amazing TikToks that explain how to interact with service dogs. Honestly, if it were not for TikTok, I would not have known the importance of not distracting a service dog while they are working. 
In one video, Mabel’s owner shows good and bad examples of how to interact with a service dog. Of course, it is super easy to want to go up to a dog and pet it (I mean Mabel is adorable), but we have to respect their space and let them do their job because they are assisting people whose health and safety rely on the dog’s full attention. 
As someone who does not have a disability, it can be very easy for these kinds of barriers and lessons to go unnoticed. We are so accustomed to architecture, transportation and more that suits our needs or are easily accessible, affordable and available. 
If you are fortunate enough to be in a major whose classes are housed in newer buildings on campus, there is guaranteed access and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, USC is more than 100 years old, meaning that many campus buildings are just as old, and have little to no accessibility for wheelchair users.
Similarly, if a newly admitted student who uses a wheelchair decides they want to live in campus housing, their options are limited. First-year residence halls such as New and North Residential Colleges, Marks Hall and Trojan Hall do not have elevators. 
USC needs to do better and in the same way people have fought so hard for better accommodations during the coronavirus pandemic, people need to do their part to fight for accommodations for people with disabilities — both physical and mental. As we return to campus for in-person semesters, we need to consider how all students will navigate campus and how people without disabilities can use our privilege to ensure change. 
Users such as Pol, West, Burke and Mabel’s owner have taught me more than any class, experience or media platform has taught me, and they are just a few of the creators with disabilities that are making videos on TikTok. I highly encourage people who do not have disabilities to visit their and other users’ pages to fully educate themselves and support the work that they are doing.

Directed by Takana Shirai, “Child of Kamiari Month” is a film that loves running but runs in too many directions. Released Tuesday on Netflix, the animated film tells the story of Kanna (Aju Makita), a young girl struggling with the death of her mother. Kanna strives to run for competitions in the absence of her mother, who loved running. 
While the film combines fantasy with this story of a mystical journey, it’s the emotional journey Kanna embarks on that is the most effective. Kanna is shown as a flawed character who needs to figure out who she is without her mother. The internal conflict that contextualizes the story is far more important than the external magical conflicts challenging Kanna along the way. 
After losing a race in the beginning, Kanna goes to a local shrine to cry and puts on her mother’s amulet. Everything seems to freeze in time and Kanna encounters the shrine’s god — who appears in the form of a bull —  and is confronted by Yasha, the descendant of demons. Just then, a rabbit messenger of the gods, Shiro, appears and tells Kanna that she must carry out the task of the Idaten, the god of running, and follow in the footsteps of her mother, who previously served in the role. 
Kanna’s task is to run to the sacred city of Izumo and receive chiso, or food, from gods they meet along the way, which she must deliver to Izumo for the annual feast and gathering of the gods. For Kanna, her quest is less about the task than it is about filling an emotional need she has to see her mother in Izumo, who she believes will be there.
From the get-go, there are quite a few lengthy info-dumps about Kanna’s spiritual background, mostly from Shiro, and they’re so obvious as info-dumps that they end up cluttering the story. For viewers who may not be too familiar with Japanese rituals, the abundance of information may dissuade viewers from understanding. Throw in the unnecessary demon frenemy who initially attempts to sabotage the quest and later joins it, the plot becomes much more predictable and far-fetched than it needs to be.
Likewise, the time crunch — Kanna only has a limited amount of time to travel to Izumo — never feels truly intense enough to warrant much attention. Because the time pressure is explained rather than felt, the actual logistics of the journey aren’t quite as engaging as the relationship between Kanna and her mother. Compared to the emotional narrative, the structure of the story is very much formulaic. The conflict resolution seems hastily slapped on in contrast to the development of the relationships between characters.
Thus, the most effective part of the story is how it captures grief. Despite being an excellent runner, Kanna falters during a school marathon after experiencing a flashback to time spent with her mother. As Kanna breaks down crying in the middle of the track, one can’t help but wonder why the film isn’t simply content with such vulnerable moments, however ordinary they might seem in comparison to the mystical.
There are other moments like this too. Kanna’s father buys Kanna running shoes, only for them to be too small — he doesn’t know Kanna as well as it’s implied her mother does. Yet, no matter how alienating Kanna’s life might seem, her father is deeply present. There is no way to villainize this character who’s simply trying to help his daughter overcome her grief in small, everyday ways.
“Child of Kamiari Month” thrives when it centers on everyday life and facing the challenges that come with it. When it’s not distracted by the weight of pushing forward heavy philosophical messages about human nature, it’s lightweight and free. There is so much emphasis on physical magic that one forgets about the quiet parts of humanity. The fantastical elements are beautifully animated and imaginative, but the most powerful imagination is that of Kanna’s, who imagines moments with her mother to relive them.
In the end, the film doesn’t win many competitions for storytelling. The story walks more than it runs and doesn’t pass the baton quite effectively enough. Even then, “Child of Kamiari Month” keeps going. There’s a finish line up ahead, and it races forward.
