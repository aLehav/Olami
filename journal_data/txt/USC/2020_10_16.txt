The long-awaited Season 16 of “The Bachelorette” premiered Tuesday, and it was filled with tears, dramatic coronavirus tests and, of course, dramatic men. 
This season took an unexpected turn when the coronavirus hit the United States. Just a couple days before filming was supposed to begin in March, shelter-in-place orders put Clare Crawley’s season as the show’s lead on hold for several months. But we are finally back, and there is so much to unpack for the upcoming season. 
So, who is Clare? Clare’s debut into the “Bachelor” world was on Juan Pablo’s season back in 2014. Since then, she has been on two seasons of the hit spin-off “Bachelor in Paradise” and even had a failed engagement on the not-so-hot spin-off “Bachelor Winter Games” (a fact that ABC completely ignored in Tuesday’s premiere). That’s right: This is Clare’s fifth time looking for love on a television show, and here’s to hoping it finally works. 
Clare seemed to be an unusual choice for this season’s lead, as most bachelorettes are hot off the latest seasons of “The Bachelor,” yet it has been five seasons and six years since she first appeared on the franchise. So, yes, it is clear that Clare has had little success when it comes to finding love on reality television, but her positive spirit and refreshing maturity pull you in to follow her journey one more time. 
She also became the oldest bachelorette in franchise history at 39 years old. This was a welcomed change coming off of previous seasons with women as young as 22 and our last bachelorette, Hannah Brown, who was just 24. After many viewers complained about the show’s generally young cast, which resulted in more drama than lasting romance, the older cast got a more positive reaction. 
Instead of diving into the men’s introduction tapes and the iconic limo arrivals, the show aired about 45 minutes of pandemic content in a two-hour episode, including ABC News headlines and iPhone videos of Clare social distancing in her home after filming was postponed. 
We got to see the contestants fly, with masks, to the new shooting location at the La Quinta Hotel in Palm Springs, where they quarantined for two weeks. Several coronavirus tests later, the men, crew and Clare were all let out of quarantine and into the bubble they created at the resort. While these steps are obviously important for the safety of the people on the show, the presentation seemed a little dragged out and repetitive.
Finally, the limo entrances began, and we met the 31 men vying for Clare’s heart. 
With creative entrances and witty jokes, the men seemed excited, mature and ready to fall in love. While most decided to keep their entrances low-key, often talking about how nice it was to finally touch or hug someone else, there were a few men who had fun and tried to stand out. However, this did not seem to impress Clare, as she had eyes for only one man as soon as he stepped out of the limo. 
Dale Moss, a former pro football player, stopped Clare in her tracks, and after their quick conversation, she said, “I knew it. I definitely feel like I just met my husband. Oh, my God. I’m shaking.” That was quite the introduction.
As the episode continued, we got to see the usual flirtatious conversations, funny confessional interviews from the men and a little bit of drama. The rose ceremony commenced early the next morning, and a few men left the show. While it seemed like a typical first episode for “The Bachelorette,” the preview for the rest of the season featured lots of tears, comments on Clare’s age and maybe even an early departure from the bachelorette herself. 
“The Bachelorette” airs every Tuesday on ABC, and this season is definitely one to watch. Whether you have always been an avid viewer, you need an escape for a couple hours every week or this is your first time watching, definitely tune in for this one. Rumored to have “blown up” the entire season, Clare seems like she is going to follow her heart. But only time will tell whether she’s found love or failed at finding a husband on reality television once again.

Originally scheduled to air in April, the 2020 Billboard Music Awards was postponed due to the coronavirus but nevertheless delivered an energetic production. Since the release of the nominees in September, viewers worldwide have anticipated the annual award show, which aired live on Oct. 14.
Singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson returned as the host for the third year in a row. In addition to hosting the show, she joined Pentatonix and Sheila E. for the first performance of the night, singing Whitney Houston’s “Higher Love.”
The performance preceded the first award of the night, Top 200 Album, given to Billie Eilish for “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?” Lil Nas X followed next, accepting the Top Hot 100 Song award for “Old Town Road” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, and Eilish again returned to the stage to claim the award for Top Female Artist, beating superstars and fellow nominees Ariana Grande, Halsey, Lizzo and Taylor Swift.
On the roster of performers, Brandy and Doja Cat made their debut as first-time BBMA performers and nominees. Other artists were more familiar with the BBMA franchise, including Sia, Alicia Keys, Swae Lee, Kane Brown, Bad Bunny, SAINt JHn and Luke Combs.
Post Malone appeared in an unknown remote location set amidst an industrial structure to sing “Circles.” Immediately after, Tyla Yaweh joined him for a duet of “Tommy Lee” as colorful fireworks lit up the background to make for an electrifying performance. This looked borderline dangerous, especially with the machinery surrounding their location, but luckily there were no malfunctions.
In addition to performing, Post Malone was nominated for 16 different awards, the most of the night. Lil Nas X followed with 13, and Billie Eilish and Khalid were next with 12 each.
During the night, many winners used their speech time as a platform to advocate for current issues, such as the coronavirus pandemic and upcoming presidential election. Eilish, who urged everyone to “please wear a mask” when accepting her award, was the only celebrity with a mask on. She and Lizzo devoted their presence on stage to encourage viewers to vote in the upcoming election. Lizzo walked on stage with a dress patterned by the word “VOTE” as she claimed Top Song Sales Artist.
John Legend, a two-time Billboard Music award winner, delivered an emotional rendition of “Never Break” from his new album “Bigger Love,” which was dedicated to his wife, Chrissy Teigen, who had a miscarriage two weeks prior. Voice aching, he told viewers, “this is for Chrissy,” as he sang in front of a piano. Legend did what he does best, conveying grief and heartbreak in this tribute to his wife. 
Another familiar face, Demi Lovato, returned to the BBMA stage in a debut performance of “Commander in Chief,” a powerful stance against President Donald Trump, which was released a day before the event. Lovato has four past BBMA nominations but was not nominated for anything this year. 
A flow of winners was then announced — Bad Bunny for Top Latin Artist, Post Malone for Top Male Artist and Khalid for Top R&B Artist. Garth Brooks was the recipient of this year’s Icon Award and sang a medley of hits from throughout his legendary career. Harry Styles was also presented the first of three fan-voted categories, Chart Achievement Award, but he –– much to the disappointment of fans –– was not present at the ceremony to accept it.
The BBMA prepared for the end of the event with two performances left. From South Korea, BTS delivered an exuberant production of their first number one hit on Billboard’s Top 100, “Dynamite.” The choreography was explosive, and the music was an exciting culmination of groove, funk and hip hop, making the long wait for their act worthwhile. BTS was in the running for this year’s Top Duo/Group but lost to the Jonas Brothers. The group, however, took home the Top Social Artist award, marking their fourth consecutive win in the category. Iconic R&B group En Vogue concluded the jam-packed night with a special rendition of their hit song, “Free Your Mind.”
This year’s BBMA underwent many changes in order to maintain a safe and socially distanced event. The event was without a live audience, making the night more silent and awkward than usual. Nonetheless, with Post Malone winning nine trophies and world sensations BTS and Garth Brooks lighting the stage on fire with their performances, the 2020 BBMAs was anything but uneventful or boring.

Although a track in their debut Korean-language studio album is titled “Pretty Savage,” the members of BLACKPINK are anything but in their new documentary “BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky.” Directed by Caroline Suh, the Netflix Original documentary released Wednesday follows the girl group from their debut to their groundbreaking 2019 Coachella performance. 
Interspersed with performance footage and pre-debut evaluations are direct interviews with the group’s four members Lisa, Jennie, Rosé and Jisoo, which is where the documentary becomes more personal. These vulnerable moments expose BLACKPINK’s sincerity not only through their on-stage personas, but also who they are behind the scenes — a much-needed look at the group who recently became the first girl group to top the Billboard Artist 100 chart. 
A lukewarm Los Angeles Times review of BLACKPINK’s first full-length album “The Album” contends that the group is known more for their success rather than their actual identities. This documentary seeks to deconstruct that, giving a unique voice to BLACKPINK’s members that was lacking in their debut full-length album. “BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky” glimmers in its quiet moments, where the individual voice of each member shines through their subtle differences, a clear contrast to their unified performances as a group. 
The documentary cycles through each of the member’s stories, giving them the individual care and attention they need. Jennie talks briefly about her life in New Zealand and how she wishes she could have made memories in high school as opposed to becoming a trainee at a young age. Lisa earnestly discusses the difficulties she had coming to an entirely new country from her home of Thailand, one major obstacle being the language barrier between Thai and Korean. 
Jisoo expresses her down-to-earth nature as she recalls that when she was younger, she was treated like an “outcast” for her appearance, a shocking statement coming from a member widely praised for her visual beauty. When the makeup artist next to her tells her that she’s the prettiest one now, Jisoo smiles gleefully, but it’s the kind of happiness that makes the audience smile too. Rosé begins to cry as she talks about her love of music and the sacrifices she made to pursue her dream in South Korea. These small victories and difficulties are paralleled with the larger ones of BLACKPINK as whole, unifying these personal stories as part of a larger narrative of resilience and growth.
There’s a slight tinge of humor in “Light Up the Sky,” when the members jokingly poke fun at themselves. Here the documentary becomes self-referential in a way. Jessie Yeo, Jennie’s pilates instructor, speaks fondly of Jennie’s personality as Jennie playfully dances around in the background. Jennie is shown from a more relatable angle, a clear departure from her fierce on-stage persona. As Jennie exercises, she solemnly states the necessity of having to look “perfect” on stage all the time while reproducing the exact performances. This reflective nature on the K-pop industrial complex and BLACKPINK’s place in it adds to the documentary, showing the viewer the quiet vulnerability that accompanies being a member of a widely successful K-pop group. 
Where “BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky” falls largely short is its formulaic, contrived structure. The documentary is compelling precisely because of the members’ distinct personalities, and at times, the clichéd news bites of BLACKPINK shattering records and unprecedented performances still threaten to overwhelm the narrative. These elements often feel forced, as if to characterize BLACKPINK’s members only in terms of a simplistic hard work “success story.” While it’s necessary to contextualize BLACKPINK’s successes as a K-pop group, the execution of these moments fails to acknowledge BLACKPINK’s complexity and does not clearly distinguish the group from any other “successful” K-pop band throughout history. 
The central question of “Light Up the Sky” isn’t whether or not BLACKPINK is likable; from what they show us in this documentary, they have already proven that they are. It’s whether or not they can carry their legacy into their personal lives and if they can truly move beyond being merely a “successful K-pop group” to being widely celebrated for their achievements as a group and as individuals. If BLACKPINK is the revolution, then its members are at the forefront of the movement, and they’re just getting started.

When artists sample music, are they stealing or merely being creative and using the work in a new way? 
Before diving into my research on the art of sampling music, I’ll admit I was the person on the end of the argument who believed it was an unnecessary and uncreative way of taking someone else’s work, putting your name on it and achieving success without giving credit to the original maker. Hot take for a music devotee — I know. 
As a fan of music and genres spanning many decades, I’ve found myself asking this more than a few times when listening to music today and hearing a familiar sound directly out of a song from the past: Why do so many popular artists, musicians, singers, songwriters, disc jockeys — praised for their music and originality — sample other artists’ songs, sometimes without even finding it necessary to acknowledge that they’ve done so? 
When an artist samples a song, they are reusing a portion of a previous sound recording and reworking it in a new way to make it their own. In some cases, it can breathe new life into older songs. But not in all. 
So many artists throughout time have topped the charts in modern music by sampling songs from the past, whether they take parts of instrumentals, vocals, lyrics, a drumbeat or melodies from another piece of music. 
Dare I say that some of your favorite artists have likely taken parts of previous artists’ work and put their name on it without crediting the musician they took from. Virtually every artist does it. But does that make it OK?
Though I frowned upon the use of older work in newer pop songs at one point, now I think of it as giving music of the past a new life to a generation of listeners who may be unfamiliar with the works of previous artists. 
There’s an added brilliance to being able to rework a piece from the past and make it relevant again, especially at a time when media, the music and entertainment industries are all drastically changing the way they produce content and engage with technology. The fact that an old tune or lyric can resonate in popular culture today, even if in a new way, is powerful and tells of the artist’s consideration for the original maker and modern times. 
And I’m not saying this is a new thing — sampling has been around for decades. Madonna used the opening of “Gimme Gimme Gimme” by Swedish Europop group ABBA for her hit song “Hung Up,” released in 2005. A Tribe Called Quest sampled Lou Reed’s “Walk On The Wild Side” in their ’90s classic “Can I Kick It?” Jay-Z and Kanye West sampled Otis Redding’s “Try a Little Tenderness” in their 2011 hit “Otis.” The list goes on. 
In 2019, when pop music sensation Ariana Grande released “7 Rings,” upon first listen, I’ll admit, I was a bit protective over the song she’d sampled because it was one of the most memory-guarded tracks of my childhood. “7 Rings” samples “My Favorite Things” from the film “The Sound of Music,” which I watched religiously as a kid, enamored by Julie Andrews’s voice and the beautiful melodies littered throughout the soundtrack. 
Originally written by Rodgers and Hammerstein and sung by Academy Award winner and Broadway legend Julie Andrews, Grande uses the song’s melody from the beginning of the single when she sings “breakfast at Tiffany’s and bottles of bubbles / Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble / Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines / Buy myself all of my favorite things.” 
At first, knowing the lyrics from the original 1965 song and the difference between the new lyrics Grande provided to the old melody made me unsure of how Grande was using the song — whether she was admiring an old track or ripping off an old tune for the sake of making a catchy new hit. But, she completely changed the song and did so in an effective way, making it fit her personal experiences while also appealing to popular culture. What better way to introduce the song to a new audience and give the melody a new life than that? 
Despite my original questioning, I quickly found myself unable to keep from moving to the beat, which, in my mind, must have meant there was something about this that worked and clicked with 21st-century sounds, lyrics and listeners. Suddenly, my uncertainty became appreciation. I also couldn’t help but be excited that someone else had the same love and admiration for Andrews’ song that I did. 
In this way, what I believe many artists have in common when sampling previous works is the ability to use them in unique ways, putting a spin on the original genre the song was attached to, changing the pace of the rhythm or switching in an instrument for another to produce a different sound with the same chord progression. Sampling music is an art in itself. 
Sampling is the foundation of hip-hop, a genre created by African and Latinx Americans. Paying respect to artists that came before, hip-hop began with producers sampling early funk, soul and disco records. Old tracks began to take on a whole new meaning, becoming an integral part of the sound and culture of hip-hop. 
From pop to electronic to hip-hop, the use of samples is inevitable in the music industry and has influenced genres all across the board. Some of the songs that utilize samples from previous works end up becoming even more popular than the original song sampled. 
I don’t think that’s something to be disappointed about. Though some artists may be territorial over their work, I don’t think the intention of a true artist — who values originality and whose passion goes beyond fame — is to “steal” music for the sake of being unable to produce with their own tracks. 
Thus, sampling music is not an act of exploitation but often admiration. It gives good music another chance for the beat to live on and resonate with new listeners once again.

By: Julia Leb
There is an unfortunate disconnect between those who admit that cognitive biases exist and those who actively counteract their own biases. In my experience, there are two reasons for this. We are quick to make lofty statements about the momentous influence of bias on other people’s decisions, but somehow we also believe that we are exempt from these cognitive pitfalls. Or, we are vaguely aware of the systemic imperfections in our judgement and simply opt out of improving them. 
Regardless of one’s rationalization of choice, with Election Day around the corner, it might be useful to get specific about a common cognitive bias so that you can let it seep into your brain and become a part of  your decision-making process. 
The cognitive bias of the day is called the availability heuristic. Heuristics are largely unconscious mental shortcuts that your brain takes in order to avoid doing excess work and concentrate on the most necessary parts of cognitive processes. The availability heuristic is something that your brain does to bypass operations involving calculating probabilities and likelihoods. Instead of assessing the actual frequency of an event or considering the factors involved in creating an event, your brain will often predict the likelihood of an occurrence based on how easily the occurrence can be recalled. Thus, if something is hard to remember, you’re less likely to think that it will happen, regardless of how frequently that thing actually occurs. 
A study published in Cognitive Psychology illustrates this effect clearly. Participants were asked whether words that start with “K” were more common than words whose third letter was “K.” Seventy percent of participants believed that words starting with “K” were more frequent. Seventy percent of participants were wrong. This is because it is much easier to summon words starting with ”K” to mind than scan the length of various categories of words to check if their third letter is “K.” In other words, most people used the availability heuristic to determine which outcome was most likely and in this case, it caused an unjustified bias toward words that begin with the letter “K.” 
Within the framework of an election happening under the rule of quasi-technocrats such as Mark Zuckerberg, the importance of being aware of the power that the availability heuristic wields cannot be understated. Not only is your brain sometimes tricking you, but there are also powerful entities out there with a vested interest in tricking you as well. 
The Cambridge Analytica scandal concerned with the 2016 presidential election serves as an example of how big tech seeks to use your own psychology, heuristics and all, against you in the context of the democratic process. Briefly, the company was a political consulting firm that illegally gained access to 50 million Facebook users’ data without permission. Moreover, much of that data was offered to clients in the form of a service known as “psychographic targeting,” a form of targeted advertising that directs traffic based on individual personality traits. You might be asking yourself how accurate this method is. A study published in 2013 by psychologists David Stillwell and Michael Kosinski reported that, through access to a user’s likes alone, one could accurately predict information such as sexual orientation, race, political partisan association and even personality traits. 
Most notably, Cambridge Analytica is the same firm that worked closely with the Trump campaign in 2016. The campaign also significantly relied on ad targeting as one of its main strategies. 
So, we live in a world where campaigns have access to psychometric evaluations of voters and are actively trying to use psychology against them. The availability heuristic stands as a specific vulnerability to be exploited, and there are two ways this can happen. 
First and most generally, if campaigns flood political users with certain targeted information favorable to a political party or candidate, this renders that information easier to recall in the minds of those potential voters. For instance, let’s say a candidate (President Trump) is trying to convince a population that their opponent (Hillary Clinton) is corrupt. Frequently mentioning instances of their known corruption might convince voters that this candidate is frequently engaged in fraudulent behavior by making such an instance easily memorable through repeated exposure, whether or not this crookedness actually is as frequent as presented. This effect is exacerbated by the fact that firms such as Cambridge Analytica can very effectively grab the attention of users on behalf of whichever political candidate happens to be their client. 
Moreover, through the use of psychographic targeting, these firms can also determine which voters are more likely to fall for certain cognitive biases. They then concentrate the direction of ad traffic to those specific users who are most likely to be manipulated by complex marketing schemes. 
In navigating this brave new world, you should not simply “trust your gut” when it comes to information that can easily be researched. Your gut does a bunch of stuff that you do not know about to save you some time and there are people out there trying to exploit that. As far as mitigating the dangers of the availability heuristic is concerned, I would make two recommendations: 1) Try to avoid eyeballing how probable or frequent you think something is and just look it up and 2) do not equate repetition with truth — there is no causal link between a fact being true and a fact being frequently repeated. 
I want to end with a final note on bias. People rarely know that they are acting on bias. This means that you, me and everyone else are seldom aware of when our own cognition fools us. Let the existence of cognitive biases and biases of all kinds serve as a lesson in humility. It is important to do research and base claims on actual facts and not on our own confidence in those claims.  
Special thanks to my reasoning and argument professor, Andrew Stewart, for teaching me about cognitive biases and the availability heuristic!

Sorry, not sorry — we’re talking health care in the sports section. 
It is one of the hottest topics of the 2020 election and for good reason: Millions of Americans’ health care is at risk in the middle of a pandemic. It is estimated that up to 12 million households have lost their employee-sponsored health insurance since February, and with the Affordable Care Act hanging by a thread in the courts, the country may see the health care crisis worsen. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if some of these households supported an NCAA student-athlete.
Medicine and sports have a deep connection, especially in the world of college sports. It is estimated that in a five-year span, more than one million injuries result from college athletic activity. For perspective, an average of 460,000 athletes compete in the NCAA every year. 
These injuries could range from a simple strain to a blown-out ACL, but what matters is where they happen and who is going to cover the expenses of treatment. It’s a lot trickier than “we break, we buy” in college athletics, and that’s what I want to talk about today.
The NCAA’s rules on medical insurance and who pays for what are confusing, leaving many athletes who sign the dotted lines committing as teenagers in the dark as to how they are actually protected.
The NCAA requires every student-athlete to have personal insurance. The policy could be held by themselves, their parents or, if neither is feasible, through the school they play for. Almost all Division I, II and III programs have insurance options for those who come without one; USC is no exception. However, “almost all” implies that there are student-athletes out there who still slip through the cracks, and the solution is a lot more nuanced than forcing all schools to have an insurance policy for students. 
First, the medical treatment available to athletes is questionable in nature. Athletic trainers and physicians are the first ones on the scene, but we have to keep in mind who their employers are. 
The NCAA passed a rule in 2016 barring coaches from having direct influence on medical personnel and treatment of players to prevent disruptions of care for the sake of playing time. However, there have been multiple citations of programs that violate players’ medical autonomy, and the line between treating toward healing and stitching up for field return can be blurred.  
It should be noted that in the USC student-athlete handbook under the medical coverage section, the policy states that “referrals to outside health care providers without prior approval from the USC athletic medicine staff may not be financially covered.” This sentence comes after the policy claim that all medical costs outside of insurance are covered by the USC Athletic Department. In other words, student-athletes are financially bound to the recommendations and treatments by AD-hired doctors. 
At least USC has a talented and deep roster of physicians available for athletes at any time. For those in D3 or smaller programs, the lack of personnel could mean an uncovered hospital visit. Sure, they can apply for the NCAA Student Assistance Fund, but those are processed on a case-by-case basis and carry no guarantee. 
The NCAA needs to centralize the health care of all its student-athletes. These 18-to-23 year olds put their bodies under extreme pressure to perform for their schools’ revenue, and the dispersing of coverage policy sends the message that the association doesn’t want to take on the responsibility of an employer. 
Sure, the NCAA can play the savior ads about the housing and scholarships they give athletes and how they are the jumping-off point for so many. But is that worth anything if the association won’t cover for an athlete when an injury inhibits them from jumping in the first place? 
Student-athletes’ bodies are not expendable or replaceable. It’s time the association stops allowing athletes to fall through the cracks of a broken health care system and takes some responsibility for its revenue generators.

Normally at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, Sophia Mazzella can be found running around the set of “The Morning Brew,” clipboard in hand, checking in with the crew and ensuring that the show is ready for its 10 a.m. premiere. 
But this year, rather than meeting with her team in the studio each week, she has adapted to Zoom pre-production meetings to virtually pull off her new Trojan Vision show, “Campus Vision.” Mazzella, who is now a junior studying cinema media studies, adapted quickly to the online setting in order to book interesting guests and produce a show that audiences on campus and around Los Angeles would want to watch.
Trojan Vision, a student-run School of Cinematic Arts television station, has shifted its television production to a virtual setting because of coronavirus restrictions put in place for the fall semester. 
Before USC shifted to an online environment, Trojan Vision students enrolled in CTPR 409 managed, produced and crewed the shows from studios on the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts. Their shows, now aired on Facebook, normally run on a cable channel that would broadcast to over 700,000 people on campus and in the L.A. area. 
Trojan Vision hopes to keep viewership consistent with pre-pandemic numbers through efforts with marketing, alumni and industry contacts, campus outreach and external outreach to other stations and schools. 
Mazzella has volunteered with Trojan Vision since her freshman year. Now a general manager for Trojan Vision, Mazzella started “Campus Vision” this semester to highlight different campus organizations in five minute episodes. Creating the web series has helped Mazzella stay connected with the campus community and Trojan Vision while classes remain online. 
“I feel like we’re trying to keep that community together, and I think that now we’ve come up with a lot of ways to do that,” Mazzella said. “I’m excited about new people coming in and trying out Trojan Vision hopefully next semester, because I think that when this first happened we were like, ‘How do we keep this going?’ but we kind of figured that out now and I think that our community is like coming back together in a really exciting way.”
Kathleen Dowdey is a CTPR 409 instructor as well as the faculty coordinator for Trojan Vision. Over the summer, Dowdey and other course instructors searched for the appropriate software for students to produce shows from home. 
The instructors decided on StreamYard, a live streaming studio that works with social media platforms like Facebook. StreamYard has been an efficient tool used to create virtual segments and helped Trojan Vision reach its audience, Dowdey said. 
“[After going through lockdown in the spring, the faculty decided] that if we were really going to be in lockdown again through the fall that we had to keep producing the shows because that’s what we are, a practicum in television production,” Dowdey said. “This was a way that we could produce shows virtually and then stream them on Facebook Live which is what we are going to be doing this fall and it was a huge, huge adjustment.”
Traditionally, Trojan Vision has eight to 10 shows that run each semester, including talk show “The Morning Brew,” sports show “Water Cooler” and “Delish,” a cooking show. Normally, each section of CTPR 409 is assigned a show to work on for the semester, but this semester, students produce their own segments as well as crew on other students’ projects.
The crew is made up of the 409 class and remains on StreamYard, the platform they record on, as well as on Zoom, where the crew communicates so the cast does not hear them. Meanwhile, the host and guest are only on StreamYard. 
Paulina Suarez, a fourth-year architecture student in Dowdey’s course, said that although remote learning was challenging at first, faculty were able to weave students into the new system so that they could continue producing from home. 
Normally, students in the course assist showrunners and producers, but Suarez said the isolated virtual semester pushed students to spearhead their own segments. 
“And then, in our segment, we write it, come up with ideas and themes,” Suarez said. “We find our host, actors and actresses and then we help each other with the different positions that we need help with, like the cast. So basically you’re like your own director, producer and scriptwriter which is pretty cool.”
The cast usually consists of people who have previously hosted Trojan Vision or School of Cinematic Arts students. In order to choose who she wants to cast, Paulina finds audition tapes on the School of Cinematic Arts community portal.
Diya Mehta, one of four general managers at Trojan Vision, runs marketing and social media for Trojan Vision shows to make sure the USC community knows about its programming and opportunities to get involved. 
Mehta, a senior majoring in business administration with a minor in cinematic arts, also created a newsletter to keep the community updated on Trojan Vision and its productions. However, ever since operations moved online, Mehta said it has been challenging to keep students engaged.  
“Across the board all production classes have taken a hit, just because a big part of production is the hands-on work like working with the camera and the lighting,” Mehta said. “So I think, despite that, Trojan Vision is really doing well, despite … having a lot of students not be able to be on set. We’re really pushing through that and we’re creating content despite that.”
