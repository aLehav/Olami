As one of the smallest schools within USC, the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance is a tight knit family of incredibly intelligent and creative dancers from across the world. With a topic so niche, one may overlook dance studies if they do not already have a great interest in the art form. However, Kaufman is lush with various cultures, human fluidity, historical consciousness and artistic flair. And what is one of the best ways to start integrating with the community? Learn about the excellent students who create it.
Isaiah Franklin, Class of 2024
Right outside of the city of Atlanta is Marietta, Georgia, where 18-year-old Isaiah Franklin practices his craft. This includes not just the breathtaking dancing that landed him in Kaufman, but also singing, producing and whatever else he can get his hands on.  
“I’m trying to find a way where I can make both dance and other art coalesce, that’s what I’m interested in,” he said. Beyond his many artistic and musical endeavors, though, dance is the go-to source of his creative process.
During the playful experimentation of developing his voice, Franklin looks to R&B, pop, alternative and other music genres. Really, anything with a good beat and solid instrumentals. Franklin is certain that he is uncertain about having one single source of inspiration, and instead aims to try on as many artistic hats as he can get his hands on. The coronavirus pandemic presented dancers with difficult obstacles to overcome, and Franklin is eager to collaborate with other students and faculty when the digital barricade finally goes down.
“Imma go hard,” he said. “I think it’s gonna be beautiful.”
Franklin is aiming to reach his goal of raising $3,000 for USC tuition and fees. You can support his education here: https://www.gofundme.com/f/m647tv-help-me-stay-in-school 
Amanda Peet, Class of 2024
Beyond the dance studio, Amanda Peet of Dallas is a 19-year-old Virgo, caffeine addict, stressed college student and lover of music. When you watch her perform, however, she is an improvisational genius.
Peet breathes dance and allows intuition to guide her body movement. There is much that goes unspoken about improvisational dance that Peet appears to effortlessly master. 
“One hundred percent of the time it’s never the way that I expect it or want it to be, but I also think that there’s a lot of beauty in that. I don’t like to be something that’s expected, I don’t think any dancer [does],” Peet said.
In a similar sense, Peet could not have predicted the discoveries that she would make at USC, as she is continually challenged to broaden her mindset. She mentions the gentleness and kindness of her professors at Kaufman, who have assisted her in deconstructing a Eurocentric perspective on dance into a completely new one that is being built upon every day.
Peet is blossoming as a young dancer, and is super excited to present her work to her family for her Repertory & Performance class during a virtual show in April.
Diego Lopez, Class of 2024
The naturally suave manner that emanates from Diego Lopez comes from his 13 years of dancing in Chihuahua, Mexico.
His focus is on hip-hop, but he is an enthusiastic learner for all things dance, including ballet, jazz, tap and more. Upon his acceptance into his top choice school, Lopez has been representing his home country at Kaufman while immersing himself in the new environment.
Lopez describes the Mexican dance style as more passionate and deeply emotional, while the United States’ approach is more consistent with training techniques. He is able to combine the two during his unique journey at USC. Lopez’s identity as a dancer has already expanded at Kaufman.
“[I’m] thinking about being an arts scholar, not just thinking about the arts as a movement but also as an impact in society, an impact in my life and how I perceive the world has really affected me and helped me through a lot.”
In just a few months, Lopez has begun to open his mind to so many aspects of his love for dance, such as the immense influence of Black culture on hip-hop. He looks forward to uniting with the familiar faces he sees every day on Zoom, creating and collaborating in studios and continuing this exploration of what it means to be a fully embodied entertainment artist and dancer without confines.
Jada Walker, Class of 2023
When Jada Walker is done with her classes at Kaufman, she closes her laptop and becomes the teacher. Interning at her studio Dancezone as well as teaching at Xtreme Level Dance and Soreal Dance Studio, Walker shares her personal choreography and steps into a lead figure for other dancers.
This role helps Walker develop her own uniqueness. 
“I think [teaching] influenced me more to be unique rather than conform to what everyone else is doing …  it’s given me more freedom to just express the way I want to move.”
But Walker also knows there is still so much to learn.
As a psychology minor, she is on a mission to answer questions about why we act or move the way we do and the connection between mind and body. Her curiosity and experience undoubtedly propels her at USC and will continue to support her post-graduation.
Walker aspires to own her own dance studio, where she will resume the teaching role and share the wisdom she collected over the years in the dance industry. As of now, she is very humble with her impressive success thus far, growing a following on TikTok and Instagram who enjoy her ’60s, ’70s and ’90s fashion and makeup aesthetic as well as her mature creative ability. 
Ryan Phuong, Class of 2024
You may recognize hip-hop dancer and actor Ryan Phuong from his appearance on the raunchy television drama “Shameless,” Nickelodeon’s “Thundermans” and his most recent and prominent role in “The Big Bang Theory” spinoff “Young Sheldon.” What you may not know is that Phuong is also coming into his spirituality, learning meditation and self-reflection practices to stay grounded in the competitive and often judgmental entertainment world.
Since he was eight years old, Phuong’s trainer and mentor Debbie Allen helped him see that both dancing and acting require the bravery of constantly diving into one’s emotions. Expanding this mindset has helped Phuong holistically, and as he talks about the journey into radical self-love he acknowledges that “changing how I perceive myself and being in touch with my emotions more helped me to be free.”
Although hip-hop is his “bread and butter,” the encouraging environment at Kaufman inspires him to venture outside of his comfort zone and become a “hybrid artist.” For his next few years at USC, Phuong will focus on balancing his dynamic work with the social and academic elements of school. 
Anja Tempel, Class of 2024
It is a beautiful thing to watch a young person find their voice, and Anja Tempel is doing amazing things with hers. The 18-year-old from New York City is venturing into new ground with her otherworldly dance skills and passion for both analyzing and creating social change.
Tempel sees dance as physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. By not only tuning into her own senses but also being a conduit for the emotions of others such as choreographers and audience members, she sees dance as key for understanding society around her. In doing so, her awareness of injustices even within the dance world has greatly increased. 
“Dance is still reflecting the environment we’re in, which is a manifestation of racism and gender inequality,” Tempel said. 
Becoming aware of the anxieties and oppressive roles that racism plays in her life motivates Tempel to not only come to terms with but to celebrate her Blackness, reclaiming the power in her culture and identity. At Kaufman, Tempel is learning about the cultural context to dance in classes like “World Perspective on Dance Performance,” getting to know West African movement and deconstructing the inaccurate media portrayal of hip-hop. Tempel inspires you to ask yourself — am I also challenging myself to make the change I want to see?
Hope Patterson, Class of 2024
Sometimes you come across something, and for whatever reason it immediately clicks. Hope Patterson experienced this with dance just six years before being accepted into Kaufman, which is on the other side of the globe from her home in Hong Kong.
She recalls having the conversation with her parents at age 16 when they raised the question of college and whether she wanted to dance or study something academic. Patterson had no hesitation in following her call to pursue dance.
As a child, Patterson was always athletic and involved in competitive sports such as swimming and long distance running. 
“I felt like everything was a competition all the time … mentally it was a lot,” she said. Although she began her dance career relatively late, Patterson quickly discovered that “[dance] was one of the only things where I actually felt free.”
Through a two-month jazz/contemporary program at the Joffrey Ballet School in New York City, Patterson became aware of summer intensive dance programs, including one at USC. What at first seemed like a far away dream soon became her reality.
Patterson appreciates the collective mindset, explaining that “it’s not just about who’s the best dancer, who can do the most turns, whose leg is the highest. It’s also about what kind of opinions, what kind of perspective and what life experience are you going to bring.”

From producing music entirely from the bounds of their bedroom walls in Portland, Ore. to reaching listeners around the world, indie pop duo One11Twenty sets no limits on their creativity. Whether influence comes directly from their hometown, musical inspirations or personal circumstances, experimentation is always at the heart of their work. 
“Every part of our lives definitely has an influence on our music,” said vocalist Tim Jordan, half of One11Twenty. 
What started as a five-member band they formed in high school dwindled down to two fervent, talented artists — 2020 graduates Kyle DelFatti and Jordan — ready to resume their craft and pursue music wholeheartedly.
Together, the duo has achieved a musical synergy unlike any other, utilizing their creative minds, technical expertise and lyrical talents to create sounds that cross genres and conventions. Their yin-and-yang dynamic allows them to feature each of their greatest strengths in their music; DelFatti is the architect of One11Twenty’s sound, while Jordan is the mastermind behind their lyrics. 
Their rising success, though, is a result of years of diligent practice.
After playing the guitar and bass for nearly 15 years (among other instruments such as drums, piano, French horn, trombone, trumpet, violin and synthesizers), it’s evident how DelFatti developed his keen ear and instrumental versatility. 
“I’ll get pieces of instrumental gear passed down that I can then use, and each piece that you acquire influences the sound of what you do,” DelFatti said.
He even has a 1983 Panasonic Ramsa Mixing board, gifted to him by his guitar teacher. 
For Jordan, writing music initially came from his love of novels and his desire to share his voice through stories and poems as a kid. In what he calls “a roundabout way,” his childhood aspirations are now coming true through the lyrics and melodies he’s been creating over the last few years for One11Twenty.
“It wasn’t until senior year of high school when Kyle and I started writing songs that I was like, ‘Hey, I should start learning instruments too and get into music and learn how to sing,’” Jordan said. 
Working in both of their expertises, Delfatti and Jordan were in the same a cappella choir in high school, where their musical partnership and friendship was set in motion. 
“I had a bunch of songs and Tim had a bunch of poems, and he got his poems in my songs and I got my songs in his poems,” DelFatti said. 
DelFatti draws inspiration from a variety of producers ranging from Jack Antonoff to Tyler Joseph to LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER and Daft Punk. 
“I’ve always liked music that strikes this certain emotional chord with my life where I can feel like I’m framing my life with the song that I’m listening to,” DelFatti said.
When it comes to songwriting and wordplay, Jordan pulls a lot of influence from the hip-hop genre. Along with MF Doom, Kid Cudi and Jurassic Five, he also takes inspiration from classic lyricists such as Bob Dylan, John Prine and Townes Van Zandt.
How the two came up with the band name, One11Twenty, was through a particularly nostalgic and rewarding moment in any artists’ life — a paycheck. Split between the five band members at the time who’d played a good amount of shows together, including their high school prom, their $556 cash earnings came out to $111.20 (One-Eleven-Twenty) when distributed among them.
Thus, when DelFatti and Jordan joined together to focus on music together, their name became One11Twenty.
When it came time to go to college, DelFatti attended Seattle University for his first two years, while Jordan took a gap year before attending Emerson College. 
“We were always writing songs throughout that time, we’d put out a lot of music,” DelFatti said. “But I never [gave] myself permission to call myself a musician. And I was just really unhappy.”
After personal circumstances, DelFatti was in search of a new direction. 
“Choosing to go to USC was taking the leap of faith to do music,” DelFatti said. “I was an electrical engineer at Seattle University.”
Once DelFatti transferred to USC, he was on his way to new beginnings and devoted his entire time to music. 
“I have nothing but positive things to say about the music program at USC,” DelFatti said. “There [was] a bunch of us in the program that just clumped around each other … and started working on each other’s projects.”
Delfatti credits the Trojan network for providing him with incredible resources, professors and peers that have had a significant influence and impact on his music today. 
Their videographer, USC alumnus Nick Smiley, met DelFatti in Fall 2017 but didn’t officially begin working on creative projects together until 2018. Smiley, who shot and directed their “Famous Kids” music video, a song off of their 2020 album “Better Days,” acknowledges the inventiveness and devotion that the duo pours into their music. 
“There are ways that we’re experimenting and kind of pushing what we can do,” Jordan said. 
When tinkering with new soundscapes for One11Twenty, DelFatti said, “it feels like lightning in a bottle.” And despite gaining more mastery over the years, he still feels that there’s some trial and error that comes along with the process. 
“I still feel like there’s this blindness,” DelFatti said. “You only know something that’s cool when you come across it and it sounds cool.”
Songs are often written and rewritten anywhere from hours to days long before they’re at the ready stage for a release. 
“Sometimes we work on a song for more than a year before it comes out,” Jordan said. “And sometimes during that process, we’ll write like five or six songs that come out before that song comes out.” 
Such has been the case while preparing for their newest album release, “Spaceship Heartbreak.” The pair has been dropping consistent singles since mid-January — “Fantasy,” “No Peace” and out this Friday “Come back to Love” — with no set release date for the album yet. 
“I’ve gotten to hear some of the music, and it’s really good and really exciting,” Smiley said. “Kyle’s getting a lot more into working with analog synthesizers and diving into music [in] that way so that’s been really cool to observe.”
By the sound of their music, it’s hard to imagine that most of One11Twenty’s work has come from creating all their sounds in house with their own instruments, practicing and learning software from their own bedrooms. 
“I think they’ve always been musically adventurous, and I think Tim’s lyricism too is a big part of what makes the music really special,” Smiley said. “He has a very unique way of writing songs and writing lyrics.”
Though the album is not a direct analogy to quarantine itself, DelFatti noted that a lot of the themes have to do with what they’ve been going through during quarantine, graduating college and becoming young adults.
“A lot of it is just dealing with loneliness and contextualizing heartbreak,” DelFatti said — something many can relate to, especially as we’ve surpassed the one-year anniversary of the pandemic.
In coming back to the Portland metropolitan area after graduating college, One11Twenty hopes to go on tour when the world is ready. For now, they’re focusing on building a creative atmosphere with fellow Los Angeles friends and artists, honing in on their talents and getting “as good as possible” during this next chapter of their music and lives.

USC head coach Mark Trakh has been in the women’s basketball program for over nine seasons and has been a coach for more than 20 years. The Trojans didn’t end their season how they wanted, but they did hit some impressive strides. Despite various injuries to key players and heavily restricted offseason workouts, the Trojans ended their season with an 11-12 overall record, going 8-10 in Pac-12 play. 
Trakh has always been an advocate for the advancement of women in sports, especially in basketball. 
The formal offseason will start next month for the Trojans and Trakh is ready to get a full offseason to unlock the full potential of the team. The Daily Trojan spoke with Trakh to get his perspective on women’s history month and his optimism for his young team. 
DT: Give me a summary of how you feel about how the season ended for your team, and where you see the program going for next season.
MT:  All things considered, all of our injuries when we started up, it was tough. I mean, we had kids come in at different times. Our best player, Alissa Pili, was out for three months, and I don’t think she was ever 100%. 
She got hurt in early November, and then we had people come in and out of the lineup. We had an injured player come back once every couple of weeks starting in January, so you have to integrate them into the system. So when you consider that we started out with seven people — best player hurt, a lot of injuries, people coming in and out of the lineup — we won 10, I think 10, Pac-12 games this year. Counting the tournament, we finished 11-12. COVID was really tough on our kids, the isolation and doing everything they had to do. We didn’t finish the way we wanted to finish but that’s the season I guess. We did go 1-1 in the Pac-12 tournament, beating Arizona State and losing to Stanford. We’d like to have finished better, but I think that’s the uniqueness of the season of all the COVID protocols. 
DT: Do you think that your team handled the different season with COVID well? How do you see the offseason going for the Trojans?  
MT:  The team faced a lot of adversity this year so I was proud of the way they handled it. Proud of what they did this year and you know we get everybody coming back next year. We got two McDonald’s All-Americans coming in at 6’6” and 6’4”. We’re looking at some other things, so I think we can be pretty competitive. I’m looking forward to starting training April 1, next Thursday so we can have a spring, a summer [and] a fall and get ready for the season. I think it’ll be totally different. 
Our offense was about five or six plays that we were just kind of running in everything. We could never get into our offensive system and our defensive system. We didn’t have enough practice for our full group, but I think we got everybody coming back. We’ve got good kids and we’re looking forward to it. 
DT: Most of your career has been coaching women. How important do you feel exposure to women’s sports, especially basketball, is to players and fans? 
MT: When I coached Brea-Olinda High School in the ’80s, and the first few years of the ’90s, we used to pack our gym for girls basketball — High school games! Obviously, the community saw value in that, and would come in and watch the game. They would come in and have fun watching them. Then, I coached at New Mexico State and we drew really good crowds at New Mexico State. The community, you know, really loved basketball there. That’s what we want to do here at USC. If you look around the country, you’ve got Oregon that’s got a great fan base, Oregon State, Stanford, Arizona, and I think we can develop one once we start [winning]. 
We want to start winning and put a good product on the floor, which I think we’re moving in the right direction. I think we can get people to come out and develop a really, really good fan base. I think as far as women’s sports, women’s basketball is very valuable. Look at the final four — that’s going to be sold out. The ratings are going to be great. It’s a great stage for women. Look at the WNBA — those games are fun to watch. They’re drawing big crowds. So overall, I think it’s a great sport.
DT: The NCAA has been receiving a lot of criticism for the picture of the women’s weight room that had a few dumbbells at the NCAA tournament compared to the men’s weight room that had full equipment to work out, how did you feel seeing that? 
MT: We’re in 2021 now. With everything that’s gone out and all the advancements we’ve made, how can the NCAA be that tone deaf? There’s got to be equal facilities, and that was really disappointing. I know that upset a lot of people and justifiably so. I mean, the disparity between the two facilities, the strength and conditioning, the weight room. Someone should have taken notice of that before it reached the level that it did. They should have been aware of that and that should have been part of the planning. As soon as they arranged for these bubbles, everything’s got to be equal, as far as facilities. It was surprising and it was disappointing, but hopefully moving forward, that will never happen again. 
DT: With all these incredible women being celebrated for Women’s History Month, how do you see the continued success of women in all areas leading into the future? 
MT: Starting in 1980, we’re fighting for scholarships for the young women in high school, and watching what they were able to accomplish through basketball, getting scholarships and forming that bond. The discipline, the camaraderie, the teamwork, all those things they can apply to life and their jobs and the pursuit of what they wanted to do. 
I’m a big supporter of women, a big proponent that they can use basketball as a vehicle to go into different professions and be successful, and accumulate power and shatter glass ceilings. [They can] advance in whatever profession they choose, whether it be the communications, medical, whether they want to be physical therapists, trainers, coaches. I’ve always made a point of hiring an ex-player as a coach everywhere I’ve been and I want to do that simply to give them an opportunity to begin their career and try to succeed.
DT: What has been the best part of being a women’s basketball head coach all these years?
MT: Those are the things that I’m really proud of. I’m proud of what my former players have done in life and to see them be very successful in any field they’ve chosen. To see women get ahead like that, that really means the most to me and it really is the reason that I coach. I think that’s the best reward that you can get — to see what they’ve done after basketball.

In my last column, I highlighted my reservations about starting the NCAA men’s basketball tournament without taking a one-week break after all the conference tournaments ended. Even though the NCAA ensured only players and personnel who tested negative throughout the start of March and during conference tournaments could go to Indianapolis, coronavirus cases began rising in the Hoosier state’s capital as teams arrived. 
Unfortunately, this led to the NCAA’s no-contest decision of a first-round game between seventh-seeded Oregon and tenth-seeded VCU because there were multiple positive tests on VCU’s team. This allowed Oregon to advance to the second round, where they beat second-seeded Iowa Hawkeyes before eventually losing to our sixth-seeded USC Trojans. 
Going back to the NCAA’s decision to cancel the VCU-Oregon game, the collegiate organization worked with the Marion County Public Health Department in Indianapolis to make an informed decision, as the minimum number of players needed to participate in a game was five, but the NCAA and VCU couldn’t confirm if there were five players that weren’t exposed to the virus. 
“With potential risks to all involved in the game, we could not guarantee or be comfortable that five or more players would be available without risk,” NCAA spokesman David Worlock said in an email to The Associated Press. 
I do want to note that the NCAA’s decision to cancel the game and force VCU to forfeit was the correct choice in the end; however, how did the Rams even end up in this situation? 
As I worried, many suspect the positive cases in the Rams’ program can be traced back to their conference tournament in Dayton, Ohio.  
Some VCU’s situation can be attributed specifically to the mishandling of the safety protocol at the A-10 conference tournament. In the days leading up to the championship game, VCU and their opponent St. Bonaventure resided at a Marriott hotel in Dayton, Oh. along with the officiating crew. Unidentified sources with knowledge of the situation told CBS Sports the hotel had many other visiting parties there because of a high school state basketball tournament going on in the area at the same time. Even though the collegiate players and personnel were trying to stay safe, many others at the hotel not affiliated with the A-10 tournament were not adhering to COVID-19 protocols, such as not wearing masks in the lobby. 
Initially, I was worried the VCU-Oregon cancellation was the start of a domino effect that would lead to further cancellations in the tournament. Luckily, games have been relatively undisrupted so far. We have seen outstanding runs by Oral Roberts, Syracuse and our fellow Pac-12 members — Oregon State, Oregon and even UCLA. As we continue to live through Bill Walton’s tournament dream, hopefully we can end it on a high note, without any cancellations in these final stages.  
These NCAA-COVID issues are not exclusive to only men’s basketball. There were also cancellations in the NCAA’s men’s hockey tournament as three teams —  Michigan, St. Lawrence and Notre Dame — have already had to withdraw because of positive test results. 
Considering that there are only sixteen teams that participate in the tournament, having three competitors out because of coronavirus was a disaster. Unlike the basketball counterpart, the NCAA men’s hockey tournament is happening at four different sites to begin: Albany, New York, Bridgeport, Connecticut, Fargo, North Dakota, and Loveland, Colorado. Even though these regional sites are not as heavily populated as major cities like New York and Chicago, having the teams travel again later in the tournament can pose more risks. 
As we are nearing the end of our hectic collegiate sports seasons filled with cancellations and delays, the NCAA should take further precautions to properly finish out the remaining postseason matchups.

When USC alumna Mac Baker went out to eat at a nearby popular restaurant with her friend, who had a severe dairy allergy, she saw her friend struggle to order her food, causing delays for the waiter. 
“When we were ordering, [my friend] had to ask the waiter multiple times to go to the back of the kitchen to ask ‘Does this dish have dairy?’ ” Baker said. “She felt really bad putting the waiter out of his way because he was already super busy that night, and then, obviously, she felt bad because it was holding up the table.” 
To remedy this problem, Baker, along with alumni Zach Sullens and Conner Chyung, founded Nomi, a startup that provides personalized digital menus to customers with dietary restrictions, making it easier for them to place orders. On top of an allergen and dietary focused smart menu, Nomi also provides touchless ordering directly to restaurant point of service systems as well as comprehensive menu management.
Baker, an aluma of the USC Iovine and Young Academy, was required to create a startup to solve an issue during her senior year, and decided to pursue solving an issue related to restaurants and food.
After Baker’s experience with her friend, she realized that meeting dietary restrictions of restaurant customers was a real problem that needed to be solved.
“[My friend] is not the only person who goes into a restaurant with a specific  food allergy or other dietary need,” Baker said. “It happens pretty frequently, and when restaurants mess that up, at worst, they have a lawsuit on their hands … or in the best case scenario for them, they waste a dish, and they waste time and money preparing something that [the customer] couldn’t even eat.” 
Matthew Manos, Baker’s mentor and teacher at the Academy, also has severe food allergies and needs to be cautious when eating at restaurants. His passion for entrepreneurship combined with his personal experience made him “beyond excited” to work on the startup. 
“As someone with severe food allergies myself, I’ve long desired a product like Nomi which can challenge restaurants to be more transparent and inclusive.” Manos said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Having the chance to work with startups like Nomi brings a great deal of purpose into my day-to-day work and life.”
With Nomi, customers can scan QR codes on the restaurant menus which takes them to a website with a more detailed menu. The customer is met with a modern interface and an interactive menu where clicking on each dish shows the description, allergen information and price. In addition, Nomi menus provide a filter function so customers can filter out what foods they are allergic to.
When a customer filters out what they are allergic to, ways the dish can be modified to meet their dietary needs are presented. For example, if a dish is sprinkled with cheese on top, the cheese is indicated as a “removable dairy allergy.” 
Currently, Nomi is being used at seven restaurants. Five of the restaurants belong to the Bacari group in Los Angeles, and the other restaurants include Ploy II Thai Cuisine, a Thai restaurant in San Francisco and Saigon Sisters, a Vietnamese restaurant in Chicago. 
When asked for general feedback after using Nomi’s menus at Bacari, Director of Operations Michael Meyeri said the old menu was limiting and slowed down the ordering process. 
“Before we started using Nomi, you’d scan the QR code, go to our website and it would just be basically a PDF on the website, you’d have to zoom in and zoom out because we had small font,” Meyer said.  “[The old menu made ordering] time consuming, and every second counts in the restaurant business.” Thanks to Nomi, customers at Bacari now have an easier time ordering.
According to Meyer, a Bacari customer had almost a month of their life negatively impacted because they ate something they were not supposed to.
“They were going to have a tough time for a whole month, and so I really took that to heart,” Meyer said. “That was another reason why I wanted to start using Nomi, just to make sure that we’re being safe with our guests, so that they could trust us.”
Baker said that she and her team are reaching out to as many restaurants as possible, and hope to see a snowball effect when it comes to acquiring new restaurants using Nomi.
“Once you [get a couple restaurants], you’re going to get the referrals and you’re going to get happy customers, and Nomi will be more reputable if it exists in more restaurants.” Baker said. 
In the short term Baker says that the Nomi team’s main goal is to expand their restaurant network and hopefully get an investor and funding for the team to start working full time.
The name “Nomi” came from the Japanese term for “have things your way” as Baker explains that “it’s just kind of a nod to the purpose of our menu [which] is to make sure that customers who have different dietary restrictions can have their dishes the way that they want them.”
And hopefully things can go Baker’s way in the future.
“If things go my way then like I would want to work on this full time … it’s been kind of hectic juggling two jobs, but everyone on the team is either juggling two jobs or they’re currently a student,  Baker said. “We all just believe that Nomi should exist and that’s why we work on it.”

Following USC’s initial move to online classes due to the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, USC students around the world had to spend their college experience at home. To boost student morale, students in the USC Iovine and Young Academy’s Impact Lab launched the “Spread Care, Not COVID” campaign, a project to promote safe social practices and keep students united during the pandemic. 
“Spread Care, Not COVID came from a place of positivity and wanting to bring a little light to the pandemic,” said Ashara Wilson, a junior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. “We really wanted to highlight that engaging in these social health behaviors, by wearing the masks, by social distancing, is really how you care for one another.”
The campaign began with USC Communications reaching out to the Impact Lab to help develop a marketing strategy centered around on campus safety. The Impact Lab partners with organizations and companies, such as Mattel and Adobe, in a semester-long extracurricular course where students get the opportunity to apply their skills to the real world. In Fall 2020, the University itself was taken on as a client for the Impact Lab, which was co-led by IYA faculty Carsten Becker and Chris Swain, with this being Becker’s first time on the team.
As part of promoting a positive message and enthusiasm among students, campaign banners can be seen on different buildings across campus, including the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and Fertitta Hall. Designed by students of the Impact Lab, the banners boldly feature the slogan “Spread Care, Not COVID,” along with pictures of USC students and vibrant graphics. Becker, an adjunct IYA faculty member in communication and design, said that the message not only applies to campus, but also extends towards the surrounding neighborhood in showing that students care.
“When the neighbors see [the banners] in public transportation, they don’t have to worry because we’re actively promoting and engaging each other in safe behavior,” Becker said.
In addition to the banners, colorful Zoom backgrounds are available for download, and campaign branded merchandise, including hoodies and masks, can be purchased at the USC Bookstore. 
For international students, such as Jenny Choi, the past year presented unique issues, such as being forced to fly back to their home country and struggling with extreme time zone differences. Choi, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, drew motivation from these struggles when developing the campaign. 
“There is nothing really we could do at the moment other than just staying safe and keeping up with school, but I thought this campaign gave me the opportunity to actually contribute to this situation,” Choi said. “I think a lot of the students might feel the same way, so I wanted this campaign to even give opportunities to other students throughout the campus.”
The Impact Lab had to function completely remotely over the course of the campaign, creating unprecedented challenges for the team such as difficulty meeting across various time zones. However, with team members dispersed internationally, the benefit of different perspectives was brought to the table.
“[Working remotely made it] easier in certain aspects where we can all be inspired by different environments,” Wilson said. “We aren’t all in LA; we’re not all bringing that same perspective and being abroad … can help us bring our own tastes to the project.”
The team was no longer limited to students in the L.A. area. Becker said that it was beneficial in that it allowed students who were home in countries like China and South Korea to still be a part of the project. 
“[It] was really important to not just get the students that live close to campus, but also those who are in parts of the world that could reach out to their friends and how they feel,” Becker said.
Particularly with this campaign, students were able to have a more personal connection to the work they completed in the Impact Lab. Not only was this team able to get hands-on experience in tackling a real world problem, but they also were able to bring change to their own community.
“I’m really grateful that I had this opportunity, because it also gives us a chance to collaborate with people in other grades and even the past years’ students,” Choi said. “Also, being able to communicate with this USC department and our mentors [taught me a lot about] communication and even mindset.”
Becker said he was proud to see the students’ hard work bring about such a positive message to both USC and the surrounding communities. 
“Just seeing the energy and the positive spirit with which the students approach this made me really hopeful that we can keep working with USC Communications to keep promoting student unity and initiatives,” Becker said. “[It] made me really feel good about what just a group of eight to nine students can achieve.”

USC’s acceptance rate lowered to 12% for the Class of 2025, a decrease from the 16% rate for the Class of 2024. 
Of the 70,971 first-year applicants, 8,804 students were admitted whose average unweighted GPA on a 4-point scale is 3.88. 
A record-high one in five students are the first in their family to attend college. 18% are Latinx and 8% are Black — both increases from the previous year. 
International students comprise 14% of the Class of 2025, representing 88 countries. Domestic admits came from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and three United States territories. Forty percent are from California. 
As high school seniors decide on where to attend college while most campuses across the country are still closed, the University maintains their plan to be in-person for the upcoming fall semester. Admits must declare their commitment to USC by May 1.

As Los Angeles County gradually recovers from the pandemic, USC announced that it plans to bring students back to campus during the fall semester of 2021. This will be a significant semester, as most returning students have not walked on campus for over a year. Even more important, USC will have two undergraduate classes that have neither been on campus nor experienced actual college life. 
While the administration is on track to provide a series of welcome experiences to the incoming freshmen, it should also consider organizing special events and providing guidance to rising sophomores to begin their on-campus life smoothly.  
Since the Class of 2024 has been taking online classes remotely for a year, it will be challenging for them to step foot on campus and experience everything in person. They have already lost a year’s opportunity to form friendships, deepen their bonds with classmates and professors and navigate campus. They have also missed the series of fun and exciting activities the University usually organizes for new students. 
In previous years, new students participated in a wide range of activities when they arrived on campus in August. They first attended a special convocation, where they wore black robes and got inducted into their schools. After that, a series of events took place throughout seven days. 
The RecFest features recreational sports and has a combination of competition, cheerleading, live entertainments and giveaways on Brittingham Field. There are also roller skating nights, group trips to Santa Barbara and the Trojan Splash Bash at the Lyon Center, a special pool party for students to dance, swim and have fun. 
Throughout their first school year, freshmen will live in residential colleges on campus and participate in events to win the Residential College Cup. All of these activities are ingrained with USC spirit. While some of these activities were moved online due to the pandemic, the in-person experience was unable to be replicated. 
After resuming normal campus life, rising sophomores may need time to explore and get used to all corners of campus and USC Village. They will find a college lifestyle that is different from that of “Zoom University.” They may spend more time socializing and begin to worry about dorm issues, homesickness and time management. 
The administration should consider hosting special orientations, bonding events and contests for the Class of 2024 to help them become immersed in the University environment. Even though some of the events may have limited capacity due to health reasons, the class of 2024 should be able to receive guidance and assistance through attending these events. This will make them feel more closely connected with the University and foster a deep love for the cardinal and gold. 
Many students within the Class of 2024 had an abridged senior year in high school and still know little of USC’s campus even as they finish their freshman year in college. Providing them extra help by organizing special events and activities will enable rising sophomores to have a better on-campus experience and less bewilderment in this coming fall semester. This will also help the students to see their next three years at USC as living at “a home away from home.”

Remember Ariana Grande’s donut-licking incident in 2015? 
Fox News probably talked about nothing but the “anti-America” popstar for months. Despite apologizing, Grande was blacklisted nationwide for saying, “I hate America.” She remains detested by the Republican Party today, with one GOP congressman even noting that she got off easier than Donald Trump because of America’s “double standards.” 
Indeed, the United States has a double standard of forgiveness but not in the way the GOP congressman suggested. Today, the U.S. treads this line of “forgetting and forgiving” whatever happens in the past but only when the past involves the oppression of marginalized communities — slavery, Japanese internment camps and the Trail of Tears, just to name a few. 
In a recent op-ed published by The Atlantic titled “America Has Forgotten How to Forgive,” staff writer Graeme Wood discusses the resignation of Alexi McCammond from her yet-to-begin role as editor in chief of Teen Vogue. The resignation followed the reemergence of McCammond’s anti-Asian social media posts from when she was 17. Wood questions McCammond’s resignation: Is it necessary, or can we just move on with a pardon for reckless, naive teenage behavior? 
This discussion of forgiveness and accountability dates back to other controversies, such as the student whose Harvard admission was rescinded following the emergence of group chats where he used racial slurs. However, these controversies still ultimately speak to the double standard of forgiveness in the U.S. On one end, we flaunt forgiveness as a virtue and prerequisite for moving forward, especially when it is convenient for white people as a means to relinquish their guilt. On the other end, we prioritize capital punishment and a relentless lack of compassion for those convicted of crimes — and those who are not white. 
Although Wood’s article discusses maneuvering racist comments made by McCammond when she was a teenager, to say “America has forgotten how to forgive” is ironic. Of course, everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and grow, but not while in positions of power, such as editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue. If McCammond were to keep the position after the resurfacing of the racist comments, that would simply be excusing the behavior in and of itself.
After all, the U.S. has not forgotten how to forgive by any means, considering the varying reactions to the white man who killed six Asian women in Atlanta two weeks ago. In a press conference, Cherokee County Sheriff’s Capt. Jay Baker remarked about the shooter — who committed a hate crime — “yesterday was a really bad day for him.” 
Rightfully so, the comments sparked outrage; lo and behold, the captain had reposted a racist t-shirt on his Facebook back in March 2020. From this single manifestation of white supremacy, we know this same theme of compassion would not even fester if the shooter was anything but white and his victims were not part of a community that is historically oppressed and vilified in the U.S. 
For another example, remember when that white cop shot the Black man in his own apartment while he was eating ice cream because she thought it was her apartment? After she was sentenced, the media circulated photos of the woman hugging the Black judge and the victim’s brother. Absolutely, forgiveness is alive and well in the U.S., but it seems that forgiveness only reappears as a central argument when it functions as a mechanism to dissolve the racial divide and absolve white guilt. 
On the other hand, we consider incarceration a prime way of dealing accountability yet turn a blind eye to its embedded violence and corruption. We are ruthless and hungry for retribution, considering isolation from society as the solution for crime rather than rehabilitation. Not to mention the fact that the justice system denotes the death penalty as the ultimate punishment, which disproportionately impacts Black men.
Maybe we have forgotten to forgive because capitalism revolves around greed. Ronald Reagan’s and Bill Clinton’s “tough on crime” policies over-policed Black and Brown neighborhoods to funnel vulnerable populations into the prisons so they could be exploited. Specifically, the War on Drugs introduced minor drug crime bills and “three-strikes” rules that targeted Black men. If we actually wanted to “forgive” inmates, we would restructure the system and rehabilitate them instead of subjecting them to the suffering that is mass incarceration. 
In fact, I recently read “Are Prisons Obsolete?” by Angela Davis. The book is a crash course on the prison industrial complex. In simplest terms, corporations privatize prisons to exploit cheap prison labor and maximize profit. Prisons do not help inmates but merely seek to profit off of them. 
I mention this because if we want to talk about forgiveness, we should be talking about abolishing the prison industrial complex and restructuring our justice system to reorient our entire capitalist economy. This would involve disseminating police budgets, investing that money back into communities, paying reparations to those afflicted by institutionalized racism and implementing universal healthcare and education.
This paradigm is not only limited to the carceral system. We brandish lines such as “Never Forget” on every anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks — no forgiveness because President George W. Bush implemented the War on Terror to punish entire countries of innocent people and consequently instilled anti-Muslim hatred in our cultural framework. But because “America has forgotten to forgive,” are we waiting for the people impacted by Islamophobia to shrug it off and hug their white neighbors so they feel better about themselves? 
If we want to talk about the U.S.’s inability to forgive, maybe we could talk about the U.S.’s inability to empathize and its psychopathic tendencies. These manifest in the form of: cruel border camps and deportations that separate families, no universal health care, no forgiveness for student debt because “I paid my students loans, so everyone else should.” 
Meanwhile, every time a white man belligerently shoots up a church, grocery store or school, he does not die — he just had a “really bad day.” Politicians refuse to take gun control action because their paychecks come from the NRA. The Los Angeles Police Department spends more money trying to exile the unhoused from Echo Park instead of using that money toward sheltering them.
