Field, the director of the Centre for Popular Memory and a senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town was invited to speak at the event sponsored by the USC Shoah Foundation, which records testimonies of those involved with the Holocaust and has thousands of photos and videos in for the archives at Leavey Library.
The event marked the Shoah Foundation’s last lecture for the semester. Field’s presentation focused on the importance of testimonials in the healing process of Africa’s history and the future of human rights trials.
Field said apartheid in South Africa began after World War II and literally translated, means “aparthood.” The term refers to the forced racial segregation and mass genocide of the South African people until 1994. Field also explained the differences between the TRC and oral history. He said the commission acted as a judicial and truth-seeking body to achieve justice for victims and potential amnesty for perpetrators of human rights violations. Oral history, on the other hand, refers to the process where long life-history interviews are conducted for the purpose of research and documenting past events, Field said. His talk mainly focused on TRC’s trials, the reconciliation of the victims and the redemptive qualities of the commission.
Field stressed that though oral historians are valuable, their ability to aid with reconciliation is limited.
“[Oral historians] are not healers,” Field said. “I would argue that’s not our training or our profession, but we can provide insights and perspectives in understanding the emotional content of their memories and the legacies they live with.”
He also referenced his work with the Centre for Popular Memory at the University of Cape Town, emphasizing the importance of teaching the past.
“We cannot dictate to our students what their political views may be — that’s not our job,” Field said. “But we do have a role in developing open-minded, critical-thinking young citizens who are historically knowledgeable.”
The CPM has published books, and developed community radio programs, documentaries and community theater as methods of raising awareness. In the future, Field mentioned that he would like to examine shorter, on-site interviews combined with longer life history interviews to gain a fuller perspective.

Texting, calling and Facebooking are the functions most cell phone users associate with their phones, but a new report affirmed that phones often serve more sinister purposes, such as human trafficking.
The USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy released Tuesday a report exploring the burgeoning use of mobile and online technology in human trafficking. Titled “The Rise of Mobile and the Diffusion of Technology-Facilitated Trafficking,” the piece discusses mobile technology’s impact on the human trafficking of children and potential solutions to combat its effect.
After compiling data over a period of two years, Mark Latonero, the project’s research director, and his team ultimately concluded that mobile devices and online classifieds are being used at growing rates to facilitate human trafficking, specifically in cases involving juvenile victims.
“To start, we analyzed and looked at lots of data analysis and technology sources known to be sites where traffickers operated in the past,” Latonero said.
The report highlights the ways in which traffickers can exploit their victims via technology embedded within mobile phones. Latonero and his colleagues cited GPS and Internet features in most modern phones as two of the most useful tools for traffickers.
“Mobile phones make coordination easier,” Latonero said. “The phones allow traffickers the ability to reach a wider group of people at greater distances, and enable traffickers to control their victims in unique ways; there exist programs within phones to locate where people and where phones are. Thus, traffickers can discover where their potential victims are.”
The Annenberg research team stressed that the same technology exploited by the traffickers, however, can be used by anti-trafficking organizations to stop the trafficking of children.
“Law enforcement officials are using online and mobile technology for these crimes against children to turn the tables on traffickers,” Latonero said. “We hope with our report that mobile companies will take note and will become more aware, and that the private sector will also help to develop technology to combat crimes against human trafficking.”
In exploring modern solutions to work against traffickers, the report analyzes two case studies in which text-based alert systems have been implemented to warn mobile phone customers about potential trafficking threats.
“We examined a case study in Haiti, where a company by the name of digicel is working with an anti-trafficking NGO in order to develop these alerts,” Latonero said. “This demonstrates a mobile company working hand in hand with the anti-trafficking community.”
According to Latonero, Annenberg’s report was put into motion upon request of the U.S. State Department, which sought to gather more information about technology use in human trafficking.
“Annenberg has a long history of research and technology used proactively for positive social change,” Latonero said. “Our department worked with engineers at the Viterbi School to provide the computer science and engineering behind developing technology to help out the anti-trafficking community. The report draws from the strength of the two schools.”
The report also comes on the heels of California’s newly approved Proposition 35, which, among other provisions, requires all convicted sex traffickers to register as sex offenders and requires all registered sex offenders to disclose their internet accounts.
“Prop. 35 has really been productive in calling attention to human trafficking issues,” Latonero said.
Even President Barack Obama acknowledged the growing problem of human trafficking in a September speech where he called the practice a “debasement of our common humanity that tears at the social fabric of our communities, endangers public health, distorts markets, and fuels violence and organized crime.”
Moving forward, Latonero and his team hope that their findings will assist lawmakers in crafting policy specifically to combat modern human trafficking.
“Policymakers in general are eager to find real, evidence-based research that will help inform their policies in the future,” Latonero said. “There’s no doubt that policymakers of high standing can use research like this to inform national policy.”

A new study presented Tuesday has found that men are depicted in a more positive light than women in television and film. The study, which examined almost 12,000 characters across family films, primetime programs and children’s television shows, also suggests that women are almost completely absent in depictions of the highest level occupations in family-oriented media.
The study, funded by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, was conducted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. The study was authored by Associate Professor of Communication Stacy L. Smith, Marc Choueiti, Ashley Prescott and Katherine Pieper. In addition, several undergraduate students contributed to the study as part of a communication class on research.
According to the study, were that women appear less frequently than men in media, more likely to be found in G-rated films, often sexualized and shown working less often than men.
The study also found that men are about 4.5 times more likely than women to be portrayed as working in careers related to science, technology, engineering and math.
Though women are becoming increasingly represented in high-level positions and occupations, this progress has yet to be represented in TV shows or in movies.
“Women [in media] are underrepresented in the sciences, they’re underrepresented in politics, they’re underrepresented in business and that’s just not the case anymore,” Pieper said.
Smith said this is especially true for media concerning politics.
“There were only three women out of 5,839 characters — three women that were coded as political leaders,” Smith said. “One was a German chancellor and two were representatives from Congress … there were no Condoleeza Rices, no Hillary Clintons, no Nancy Pelosis in 129 films.”
The researchers believe the problems illuminated by the study could be particularly problematic for kids. Though Choueiti stresses more research must be done to determine the effects of the study’s findings, he said the depictions that were researched could affect children’s views.
“One could extrapolate that there’s potential when seeing repeated exposure to stereotypic portrayals that might have an effect on learning,” Choueiti said.
USC, with its large cinema school, could leave an effect on the future of television and movies. Smith encourages current cinema students to change the current path the media is taking.
“My suggestion to the folks in cinema would be that they are creating worlds and that they are using their creative imaginations to really explore anything that’s possible,” Smith said. “So it doesn’t have to look like the world they know, it could actually be a very diverse world, a very gender-balanced world.”
Kiersten Stanley, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, does not believe these stereotypes have affected her writing.
“A lot of my female characters tend to be stronger and it’s not so much a reaction to the trend in Hollywood … it’s just that I tend to, in general, view females as strong and independent,” Stanley said.
Annie Jankowski, a junior majoring in theater, also believes the future looks bright for the portrayal of women in the media.
“My type is usually the stronger female lead … so it’s kind of scary that there aren’t many of those roles, but looking towards what people  [and movies] like Amy Poehler or Bridesmaids are doing in creating funny female leads,” Jankowski said. “I think it’s hopefully going to get a lot better.”
The findings from Smith’s research were presented at a symposium for the Geena Davis Institute on Nov. 13.
Try standing up straight first
What about the fact that women in the media are still portrayed as sex objects? Or that, overall, the female character in television and movies docilely accepts men’s bad behavior as the norm? Or how about the fact that women are still portrayed as unreasonable, nonsensical and irrational when they get upset? I could go on…but really, it is so much more than just the secular role women are playing. There is still this overwhelming attitude that men are the masters of the universe and we women are here to please them. When I sit down to watch a movie, I can’t help noticing how much the industry panders to men and their preferences. You rarely see an effort to appeal to woman…unless it is some man bashing show on a woman’s network, where again, we are depicted as victims. We make up more than half the population people! It’s time we were recognized!

With the 2012 presidential election over, students, faculty and alumni dined Thursday night over a post-election panel discussion with top campaign strategists and student organizers at the Davidson Conference Center.
Post mortem · Panelists Larry Grisolano (left), Kaya Masler, Greg Sefain and Alex Yebri break down the 2012 election cycle in a discussion moderated by Dan Schnur (far right), director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, at the Davidson Conference Center on Tuesday. – Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
The event, hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, began with an introduction by USC College Democrats President Aaron Taxy and USC Trojans for Romney Executive Director Greg Sefain, both of whom highlighted the enormous amount of work exerted by students in supporting both campaigns in 2012.
The panel featured Larry Grisolano, a senior advisor for President Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns; Bob Wickers, a senior advisor for the Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign; Kaya Masler, president of USC Students for Barack Obama; and Alex Yebri, president of USC Trojans for Romney, The panel was moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute.
Schnur started the discussion by looking at the beginning of the election. To Wickers, the Republican primary served as a significant hurdle for the Romney campaign.
“It just entailed a very long, very expensive primary,” Wickers said. “There’s no sense complaining about it. You have the cards and you play them.”
Though Romney was perceived as a strong candidate on economic issues, Yebri said he believed the governor’s main challenge was gaining the public’s trust.
“People knew the economy wasn’t doing well,” Yebri said. “But they didn’t know if they could trust Romney on key issues.”
After discussing the start of the race, the panel discussion changed focus to the subject of key voters in the election, particularly women and minority groups. Masler said she believes changing American demographics served as one of the major structural limitations for the Romney campaign.
“The structure is looking different than it did four years ago,” Masler said. “We see people vote who would have never voted before. That was an advantage for the Obama campaign having some experience with that in 2008.”
Looking to the future, the panel discussed the possible challenges and opportunities in the 2016 election. Masler said Democrats should be wary about reading too much into any demographic advantage.
“Obama is going to have to do something big,” Masler said. “He has held a lot of people’s hopes and dreams for a really long time now. As Democrats, it would be really unwise for us to take this shift in minority votes to assume that we will win elections from here on out.”
Yebri, however, acknowledged that the Republican Party needs to adjust its strategies as a result of changing demographics.
“We have to embrace it — we have to compromise,” Yebri said.
Looking forward, the panelists discussed the challenges that both parties will face in the next presidential election. Despite these challenges, Yebri remains optimistic about the Republican Party in 2016.
“I see a lot of optimistic, beneficial people who can come to the forefront and change the vision of the Republican Party,” Yebri said.
Wickers highlighted the challenge Democrats will face in energizing a coalition that has been very loyal to Obama.
“It’s going to be very hard for Hillary Clinton to hold,” Wickers said. “It’s going to be very hard for Joe Biden to hold.”
According to Wickers, the next election will have to be a grassroots effort.
“It’s got to be friend to friend, neighbor to neighbor,” Wickers said. “It can’t just be paid advertising.”
In closing, the both guest speakers left the audience with the big takeaways from the 2012 election cycle.
The power of social media, Wickers noted, was biggest takeaway in this election.
“We have this new thing that is social and dynamic,” Wickers said. “For me, I think Twitter has been the most powerful thing to come out of this election.”
Grisolano said a more knowledgeable electorate will allow for elections that focus more on important ideas and issues.
“There’s a more sophisticated electorate than ever before,” Grisolano said. “There’s a smarter electorate out there that is more accessible to a thoughtful candidate with a concrete vision and an idea of how to get there, and I think we can have a more ideas election because of it.”

The No. 8 ranked USC women’s volleyball team didn’t need to be reminded of how difficult of a test they would face Thursday night. It was fitting that they’d return home from a grueling, four-game road trip with a bout against Stanford, the nation and conference’s top team. But on the strength of extra motivation and a desire for revenge, the Women of Troy delivered one of their most complete performances of the season.
Junior libero Natalie Hagglund recorded a career-high 44 digs, one shy of the USC record, and freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio had a banner night with 19 kills and a personal-best 22 digs, leading the Women of Troy to a thrilling 3-1 victory (25-19, 25-20, 27-29, 25-22) over the Cardinal at the Galen Center.
“We’ve felt bad ever since we went to the Bay Area and played so badly against Stanford,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “Tonight, we didn’t try to overpower Stanford but instead play within our system and take what they give us.”
The Women of Troy secured the first point of the match on a left-side kill by senior opposite Katie Fuller. Later in the set, junior outside hitter Sara Shaw finished off a thrilling rally with a left-side shot to push the lead to 10-6. Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio followed a kill with a service ace to push the lead to 19-15. Kills by Shaw and Bricio set up match point before junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard blocked a Stanford shot to seal it at 25-19. The Women of Troy attacked at a steady .333 while registering 18 kills, including six by Bricio and five by Fuller.
The second set began tighter than the first, as Bricio followed a Fuller kill with her second ace to knot the score at six apiece. The Women of Troy built a 12-10 lead on the strength of back-to-back Olgard blocks, then extended it to 17-16 on a Bricio finish. The Cardinal came back to tie it at 19-all before Fuller notched consecutive kills to bring up set point. After falling behind 7-6 in the third, USC reeled off three straight points to go up 9-7, but Stanford rallied with three of their own to go back up 10-9. Fittingly, the set went down to the wire, with each team answering the other team before Olgard finished off an exciting rally for the 20-19 lead. Consecutive Cardinal errors and kills by Shaw and Olgard gave the Women of Troy a five-point advantage and set point.
Four nail-biting kills by Stanford narrowed the lead to a single point, and sure enough, a fifth kill tied it at 24-all. Freshman outside hitter Jordan Burgess knocked down a kill to give Stanford a 25-24 lead, but Olgard came back with a kill down the middle to tie it at 25-all. Shaw turned back match point and Bricio set up match point, but Stanford remained relentless, registering three straight kills to take the set 29-27.
“I think we stayed patient, and that helped a lot,” Olgard said. “We didn’t get excited after every play but instead we stayed relaxed and that helped us win the fourth game.”
The Cardinal relayed the momentum into an 8-4 lead, but USC came roaring back to take the 10-8 lead and force a Cardinal timeout. Freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms knocked down a kill for a 17-15 lead, but Stanford rallied to tie it at 21. Bricio then finished the match with a strong kill down the middle to seal the set 25-21 and the most important win so far for the Women of Troy.
“You can think of this as a national championship game, and that’s what we’ve been striving for all year,” Hagglund said. “This win gives us a lot of confidence and assurance as a team that we can win the national championship, regardless of whom we’ve lost to in the past.”
Nonetheless, the Women of Troy will have a quick turnaround, as Cal visits tomorrow night, determined to win with its season on the line.
“They’ve got their backs against the wall and they need to be .500 to get into the tournament,” Haley said. “The biggest thing for us is to get our bench more involved and avoid exhausting our starters before the season winds down.”
A tremendous win for sure, need to carry that play into the tournament where it really counts. Have to
disagree that Samantha Bricio had a banner night. She hit only .226 with those 19 kills on 62 attempts. Only
five errors which is good, just too many tries were lacking her usual force after the first set.

The USC women’s basketball team looks to get its first win of the season against Pepperdine (1-1) Sunday in its second of four consecutive home games to start the season.
The Women of Troy (0-1) hope to bounce back from their 63-52 loss against Gonzaga and improve on their 19-12 record from last season. USC committed 24 turnovers against the Bulldogs in the opener, including 14 in the first half, and shot 19 of 51 from the field (.373 FG percent).
Five players played their first game for USC, including three in the starting lineup. Each scored by the final buzzer. Junior forward  Cassie Harberts also got her seventh career double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Harberts was the only player on the team to score in double figures, while three Gonzaga players scored 10 or more, led by Keani Alvarez’s 17. Freshman Brianna Barrett led all USC newcomers with nine points in 29 minutes.
“You’re not gonna win any games with 24 turnovers,” said  USC coach Michael Cooper about last week’s loss.
The Women of Troy did manage to outscore Gonzaga 30-26 in the second half, but the double-digit deficit they faced, which got to as high as 22 points in the first half, was too vast to overcome.
“It’s a work in progress still,” Cooper said about the new players adjusting to college basketball, “You just have to learn to live through it. Hopefully we can win some games while we’re trying to make this happen, and as long as we can do that and keep moving forward, I will feel successful.”
Pepperdine is coming off a 79-71 loss against UC Riverside Monday, after beating UC Davis 83-68 in their season opener. Forward Robie Mayberry leads the Waves with 20 points and seven rebounds per game, and forward Kelsey Patrick is the only returning starter from last season’s squad, which finished 14-15 on the season and 8-8 in West Coast Conference play.
USC is undefeated against Pepperdine all-time at 18-0 since the first match in 1977.

When it comes to NCAA title hopes and top-ranked opponents, the best rivalry showdown this weekend is being played in the pool, not on the gridiron. Saturday’s matchup between the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (23-0, 7-0) and No. 2 UCLA (24-2, 6-0) men’s water polo squads is not only a rematch of 2011’s national title game, but could very well be a national championship preview for 2012.
Scorer · Senior two-meter Matt Burton is tied for fourth on the team in goals with 21. A USC win this weekend would ensure an undefeated regular season. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
Both squads will continue their seasons at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championships next week, but there is plenty at stake in a 4:30 p.m. match being televised on the Pac-12 Network.
Both squads are undefeated in conference play, which means the winner on Saturday will win the MPSF regular season title and earn the top seed for next weekend’s conference championship. Only the winner of the MPSF tournament is guaranteed a spot in the NCAA championships, making Saturday’s match crucial for gaining a leg up in capturing the conference’s automatic bid. And don’t forget about pride.
“It’s why I play water polo,” senior two-meter Matt Burton said about the cross-town rivalry. “The Bruins always bring it, and we’re willing to do whatever we can in order to get that win. It’s pure competition at its best.”
Double-digit winning streaks are also on the line: The Trojans are on a 25-game surge dating back to last season, and the Bruins have reeled off 10 in a row.
The Trojans defeated the Bruins 7-6 in an early-season matchup, but the seven goals mark USC’s lowest scoring output all season.
“We’re going to have to choose our shots a lot better,” sophomore driver Zach Lucas said. “We need to set our teammates up, look for the cross pass, read their defense correctly, and take the shots they’re giving us.”
Junior driver Nikola Vavic leads the Trojans with 72 goals, including nine in a 19-4 win over Concordia last weekend and four in the Trojans’ previous defeat of the Bruins. Sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias is the other half of the Trojans’ dynamic scoring duo with 54 goals of his own.
A Trojan victory will guarantee the fourth undefeated regular season for USC since the MPSF’s inception, will all but ensure a bid to the NCAA Championships.
“If we win this game, we’re in,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said about USC’s chances for an at-large bid in case they lose in the MPSF Championships. UCLA is the only other squad nationally besides USC with less than five losses on the season.
The end goal for the squad is an unprecedented fifth-straight national title, but for now all the focus is on a Bruin squad that looks to be peaking at the right time.
UCLA utility Josh Samuels has 52 goals on the season to lead a balanced Bruins’ attack that has eight players with more than 20 goals.
“They’re a great passing team, and they’re very patient,” Burton said. “We throw every defense in the book at them, but they’re very good at reading drops, reading different zones and have a lot of guys who make really good decisions on offense.”
On the other side of the pool, UCLA goalie Matt Rapacz is second only to the Trojans’ tandem in average goals allowed, and had a season-high 150 saves in the two teams’ previous matchup.
Vavic, however, insists he is not worried.
“No matter how talented, every goalie out there is going to get beat with a good shot,” he said.
The teams are more than familiar with each other, and every Trojan knows the Bruins will be out for revenge after USC’s 7-4 victory over their Westwood rivals in the 2011 national title match.
“I would hate us,” Burton said. “I would be absolutely sick and tired of us. They want nothing more than to come into our house and absolutely obliterate us.”
The USC-UCLA connections are noticeable, both from the coaches’ and the players’ standpoints. UCLA assistant coach Daniel Leyson was an All-American in 1992 at USC under Vavic, and was an assistant coach with the Trojans from 2000 to 2002.
More than half of each team’s roster is from Southern California, and most played with or against each other on club teams throughout high school. Relations are friendly most of the year, but everything changes when the two sides face off.
“In the water, we don’t talk at all,” Lucas said. “It’s strictly business.”

As a diehard Boston Red Sox fan, I’ve been spoiled with a great sports rivalry.
In 2003, I witnessed rocket-armed ace Pedro Martinez head-lock 72-year-old Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer during a benches-clearing scrum and toss him to the ground in the same way Patriots tight end Rob “Yo soy fiesta” Gronkowski spikes a football. Almost a year later, I delighted in Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek punching Alex Rodriguez in the face after the $300 million man complained about getting grazed by a pitch as he sauntered up the first base line.
As a transplanted New Englander whose Yankee-fan sister once had a beer poured on her after she cheered for Derek Jeter in Fenway Park, I want a similarly charged football rivalry between USC and UCLA — maybe without the bar-brawling antics, but at least with the same amount of vitriol going back and forth.
But to be honest, I’ve been disappointed. A team should never lose to its rival 50-0. I don’t care if the program is in transition or if it’s starting its fourth-string quarterback.
Thankfully, the tides are changing and UCLA now boasts plenty of program cornerstones, especially redshirt freshman quarterback Brett Hundley.
But the Bruins aren’t there yet. UCLA remains the underdog according to most people’s perceptions. Nothing screams skepticism in a program’s turnaround more than the higher-ranked team with a better record playing at home and Vegas still ticketing it to lose by 3.5 points.
So, in the interest of fairness and helping out slingshot-toting UCLA, here are four rules to becoming a respected rival — from a Red Sox fan’s perspective.
Never whine
The Red Sox didn’t start ascending in the earlier part of this millennium until the team realized that whining about the Yankees’ spending advantage doesn’t solve problems or change the competitive balance. Focusing on factors outside the team’s control simply creates distractions.
We’re already off to a bad start for UCLA. Earlier this week, the UCLA athletic department forbid the Trojan Marching Band’s drum major is forbidden from stabbing the UCLA logo on the 50-yard line during pregame festivities. Violating this directive will result in the cancellation of the TMB’s halftime performance.
This decision was prompted by an SB Nation website called “Bruins Nation,” which sent out an inane memo to the UCLA administration begging for the policy change in the name of Bruin pride.
But this fiasco doesn’t foster Bruin pride; it reeks of helplessness and admits that the drum major’s traditional demonstration bothers UCLA fans. Without question, the Bruins need to follow USC’s lead here. The Trojans don’t care about opposing teams’ demonstrations at the Coliseum. We welcome Stanford’s rag-tag, tone-deaf marching band to poke fun at us, because we’re secure about our university’s prestige.
The only way to beat USC and become its equal is by winning on the field, not through bureaucratic tomfoolery.
Don’t overhype your rival
Pedro Martinez carried a reputation for being a bit of a head-hunter. When asked why he once threw a pitch at Yankees journeyman outfielder Karim Garcia, Martinez stared blankly at the reporter and asked, “Who is Karim Garcia?”
Martinez never backed down to Yankees hitters even when they were mashing Red Sox pitching. He brought an attitude to the mound and genuinely believed the Red Sox were not underdogs.
What’s the lesson here? Don’t overhype Goliath too much, and don’t be afraid to be a little blasé about your rival. It’s this type of irreverence that communicates your readiness to compete on the same level as your long time big brother.
New UCLA coach Jim Mora has stubbornly refused to amplify the USC hype, exuding Pedro-like stubborness — for good and ill — ever since he succeeded Rick Neuheisel. In his first press conference before UCLA’s bowl game against Illinois last December, Mora denied hearing of Neuheisel’s comments about USC’s “football monopoly” in Los Angeles ending, downplayed the importance of the rivalry and repeatedly referred to USC as “Southern Cal” even after a reporter informed him that USC’s administration doesn’t like the nickname.
His Monday news conference didn’t make mention of USC once, as Mora only referred to the Trojans as “the opponent.” Touche, Mora. Touche.
Build a blue-collar identity
The 2004 World Series Champion Boston Red Sox (wow, writing that evokes nostalgia) branded themselves as a cast of “idiots.” In stark contrast to the clean-shaven, athletic Yankees, the Red Sox filled their roster with scraggly-bearded grinders, many of whom were undesired cast-offs from their previous organizations.
Though they didn’t necessarily look like a winning team at first glance, they played with a chip on their shoulder and with the intent of disproving naysayers.
Mora has already made strides in changing the culture over in Westwood, stressing accountability and hard work. To this end, one of Mora’s first measures as UCLA’s new coach was to ban the now-infamous “senior skip day,” which traditionally saw UCLA senior football players skip the season’s last day of practice and reinforced an atmosphere of quitting and undisciplined, selfish behavior.
Similar cultural changes will enable UCLA, which often underperforms its talent level, to build sustainable success.
Win a game
This one requires no further explanation. A rivalry needs the underdog to win at least occasionally. Mind you, I’m perfectly content with USC’s string of winning 12 of 13 crosstown matchups, but for this football rivalry to matter to future generations, the scales can’t continue to tip so obviously in the Trojans’ favor.
For the first time in years, this game counts for more than bragging rights and a Bruin upset seems more than plausible. Rivalries are punctuated by cycles. The question for USC fans is whether the Trojans are in the thick of a dominance cycle, like the Yankees were when they won four World Series titles from 1996-2000, or whether they are about to enter an era of parity, like when the Red Sox and Yankees clashed in titanic showdowns from 2003-09.
Saturday’s game represents USC’s opportunity to reaffirm that UCLA still has a ways to go. If the Trojans don’t definitively suppress this Westwood revival now, these next few seasons could get pretty interesting.

For the first time in seemingly decades, this season’s crosstown-rivalry game has a lot on the line.
The Pac-12 South division title will be at stake when the Trojans visit the Rose Bowl on Saturday for their annual rivalry game. A trip to the Pac-12 title game will hang on the balance, as well.
Chance at history · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley is 3-0 in his career against UCLA, including last season’s 50-0 win at the Coliseum. Barkley has thrown 33 touchdowns this season and has set the conference record for touchdown passes against Colorado on Oct. 20. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
Many analysts felt the south division was USC’s to lose when the season began. As it turns out, its arch-rival might just be the one to take it from them.
The No. 17 Bruins (8-2, 5-2) have won four straight games since losing to California on Oct. 6. They sit in first place in the division, and a win would secure them a spot in the Pac-12 championship game for the second-straight year.
Meanwhile, the No. 18 Trojans (7-3, 5-3) are coming off two losses in their last three games. USC coach Lane Kiffin and his team are aware of how dangerous this UCLA team can be and how much better they have become since last season’s 50-0 blowout at the Coliseum.
“We have a lot of respect for what they’re doing over there,” Kiffin said. “I think coach [Jim] Mora has done a great job in his first year. It’s never easy to come into a program and get things turned around that fast.”
Though rivalry week is always intense in Los Angeles, this year’s edition has been especially newsworthy. This week, the Bruins asked that the Trojan Marching Band’s drum major not stab the UCLA logo with his signature sword. If violated, UCLA would not allow the band to play at halftime. They agreed, which has caused outcry from USC fans. Earlier in the year, a billboard of senior quarterback Matt Barkley placed in Westwood was taken down and a fake Twitter account from a UCLA player took shots at USC’s receivers. USC coach Lane Kiffin is doing his best to ignore it all, though.
“I don’t know much about that,” Kiffin said. “I don’t think I was involved in any of those.”
One thing that cannot be ignored, however, is the Bruins’ overall effectiveness on offense this season. The primary key to the Bruins’ turnaround in 2012 has been stable quarterback play for the first time in several seasons. Redshirt freshman quarterback Brett Hundley has started all 10 games and has thrown 24 touchdowns to only nine interceptions. He has also run for six touchdowns and is among the best freshman quarterbacks in college football.
“[Hundley] really can make things happen when they break down whether he’s running it or whether he’s throwing it on third downs,” Kiffin said. “So we’re going to have our hands full and have to rush really well.”
The Bruins’ other main offensive weapon comes in the form of senior running back Johnathan Franklin, who is second in the conference and seventh nationally in rushing yards with 1,270. His running has helped the Bruins average more than 37 points per game and average 496.8 total yards per game.
“[Franklin’s] a strong runner,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “We really have to make sure to tackle him in open space and make sure he doesn’t get a head of steam. He’s definitely a catalyst for their offense. We’ve got to make sure to tackle him and not give him too many gaps to squirt through.”
Though featuring a potent offense, UCLA’s defense is somewhat of a weak point. They give up a modest 24.7 points per game, but rank No. 103 nationally in pass defense, having surrendered 20 touchdowns through the air. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley, who ranks No. 2 in the country in touchdown passes with 33 doesn’t believe that a weak secondary will change the Trojans’ game plan, but is nonetheless confident in the offense.
“We look at schemes as well as personnel every week,” Barkley said. “We’ll attack certain points like we always do. I don’t really tend to look at the rankings like that because you never know how those stack against who a team is playing and all that stuff, who they’ve played in the past. So, we’ll just go through our normal scouting routine … We have a good game plan this week.”
The Trojans seem poised to expose the Bruins’ secondary, but need to cut down on their turnovers. Barkley threw three interceptions in last week’s 38-17 win against Arizona State and, as a team, USC turned the ball over five times two weeks earlier in a loss at Arizona.
“We just have to put points on the board and not leave them on the field like we did last week,” Barkley said. “Especially in the red zone.”
Senior center Khaled Holmes seconded Barkley’s sentiments.
“The only thing holding us back has been ourselves,” Holmes said. “As long as we take care of business, we should be good.”
With a possible trip to the Rose Bowl Game on the line, Kiffin knows how big this game is. But he believes the crosstown rivalry game is important no matter each team’s wins and losses.
“This game’s a big game no matter what because it’s USC-UCLA regardless of what records are,” Kiffin said. “It’s good that it’s a relevant game for two years in a row and that’s the way it should be.”
Kickoff for Saturday’s game at the Rose Bowl is scheduled for noon. The game will be televised nationally on FOX.

“True artists live basically doomed lives,” says Sophie B. Hawkins, starring as Janis Joplin in Room 105: The Highs and Lows of Janis Joplin.
Raspy rhapsody · MACHA Theatre’s new production Room 105 tells of the rise and fall of singer Janis Joplin. Grammy-nominee Sophie B. Hawkins stars as Joplin in an impressive, often manic performance that energizes the story and returns audience members to the 1960s. – | Photo courtesy of Ed Kreiger
This new musical at the Mujeres Advancing, Culture, History and Art Theatre in West Hollywood uses Joplin’s original songs to examine the complex relationship between Janis Joplin, world-famous rock star and iconic hippie and the Janis crippled at a young age by severe insecurity.
It’s fitting, then, that this piece is set, as the program explains, “in the mind of Janis Joplin’s spirit, which has come back 42 years after her death.” Set designer Douglas D. Smith renders Joplin’s psyche as the quintessential hippie den, full of draped purple velvet, an abundance of feather boas, a lava lamp, trunks full of her band’s touring equipment, bottles upon bottles of Southern Comfort and her own gravestone (which she never addresses but frequently sits on).
Janis’ wardrobe similarly evokes all things psychedelic, and the way Hawkins swaggers around in her tight velvet bellbottoms, chunky jewelry, tie-dyed top and renowned orange-tinted glasses will have you itching to raid every thrift store on Melrose. Her look is bolstered by perpetual bare feet and masses of wavy hair that are so voluminous they border on dreadlocks. The small ensemble wears costumes representative of other fashion movements of the era: One of the women wears a black and white minidress and fishnets, while another wears a boldly printed maxi dress with a matching bandana looped around her afro.
Though the set and costumes effectively transport you back to the ’60s, nothing about this musical feels dated. While it’s true that most of the audience members probably remember Janis performing live at Woodstock in 1969, a turbo-charged performance by Hawkins and her groovy back-up band will keep any viewer’s head bobbing.
Beginning with “Piece of My Heart,” which opens the show, the band rips through electrifying renditions of Joplin’s biggest tracks. No fan of her music will be disappointed — every hit is accounted for, including “Try (Just a Little Bit Harder),” “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Down on Me” and “Ball and Chain.” And though the band remains semi-hidden behind a black screen, its power is easily palpable. Guitarist Josh Sklair, who sports a rainbow tie-dye shirt and shoulder-length gray hair, channels all the guitar greats of the ’60s, shredding his solos with precision and maintaining an impressive sense of timing with Hawkins and her vocals. Drummer Corey Coverstone and bass player Daniel Pearson provide a solid rhythm section, as well.
But the success of the musical numbers should be attributed to Hawkins. Her voice, though not a dead-ringer for Joplin’s, possesses that same throaty quality that made Joplin a star. The combination of Hawkins’ spectacular range and pitch accuracy allows her to take a lot of melodic risks that pay off; she has fun with her phrasing, bending and sliding into her big notes, but never wanders out of key. And it doesn’t hurt that she has a killer rock‘n’roll scream. Hawkins’ vocal talent should come as no surprise, considering she is a successful singer-songwriter herself, having been nominated for Best New Artist at the 1993 Grammys and landing a few of her singles on the Billboard charts.
Hawkins, however, boasts more than just a pretty voice. Her resemblance to Janis also appears through her movement and line delivery. Hawkins shuffles around the stage like her slender body is on the brink of exploding from all of the creative energy that’s bouncing around inside it. She flails her arms and leaps around with manic grace — minus a few moments when she teeters to the edge of her balance and looks as if she might fall off the stage, creating a nervousness in the audience that is probably reminiscent of watching the real Joplin drunkenly perform.
Similarly, her delivery falls exactly in line with what you might imagine a hippie sounds like. Her words sort of slur together, a lot of sentences begin with, “Hey, man,” and it’s clear that she relishes phrases like “free love” and “I’m so high!” Consequently, because she does such a great job of playing the archetypal hippie, there are a few moments when you might be tempted to deem Hawkins’ performance as corny or caricature-y. Keep in mind, though, this is appropriate, because Joplin really is the model off of which many base the hippie stereotype.
The dramatic arc of the musical is the only weak point of the production. Though the content about Joplin’s lifelong insecurities and inability to satisfy her need to belong was very compelling, it should have been presented differently. Since the title of the piece refers to the hotel room in which she died (of an heroin overdose at the age of 27), you’d think the playwright would have spent more than five minutes at the end of the play discussing Joplin’s death and legacy.
When it comes down to it, if you’re a fan of great live music, you’ll definitely enjoy an evening of Joplin’s finest. Even if you aren’t a Janis fan yet, her story will lead you to think about your favorite rock stars in a different light.
 
Room 105: The Highs and Lows of Janis Joplin runs through Nov. 25 in West Hollywood at the Macha Theatre.

Few genres owe a greater debt to one person than fantasy does to J.R.R. Tolkien. With The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, he created an entire tradition of sword and sorcery, setting the standard for the sorts of characters, storylines and settings that would appear in works of fantasy for more than 50 years, and still influence fantasy culture today.

In a way, it’s almost amazing how recently the Lord of the Rings trilogy was published. It’s not even 60-years-old and yet it’s easy to assume that our perception of elves, dwarves and wizards has extended back centuries. That’s not the case at all, though. The traditional medieval fantasy tropes hail almost exclusively from Tolkien’s works.
For fantasy’s popularity and mass appeal, it should be commended. People often think of fantasy as an incredibly niche genre, but like any particular brand of media, the most celebrated, triumphant examples will usually be able to attain mainstream success. For fantasy, there’s obviously no better example than Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings adaptations — beloved blockbusters that even managed to sweep the Academy Awards with its third installment, Return of the King. And after years in production hell, Jackson’s equally ambitious adaptation of The Hobbit hits theaters this December. An Unexpected Journey, the first of three Hobbit installments, will no doubt capture the public’s adoration once again.
Though that’s all well and good, this one particular franchise has grown so ubiquitous in nature that it’s difficult, if not impossible, for many of those involved in fantasy — readers and authors alike — to think about the genre independent of Tolkien’s influence. There’s a notion that “fantasy,” especially in regard to literature, means a medieval world of magic, filled with multiple species, both humanoid and monstrous, in which a collection of unlikely heroes must go to war against some sort of malevolent force and the dark creatures that serve it. This viewpoint can, on occasion, be hugely limiting.
It’s important, first of all, to point out the distinction between fantasy and epic fantasy. The former can refer to anything depicting a world unlike our own or a world similar to our world, but with additional, fantastic elements. The first word, for instance, that comes to mind when describing the newly released and final Twilight film isn’t likely to be “fantasy,” but the term still applies.
Often, though, fantasy is used as shorthand when describing epic fantasy, the more specific sub-genre that The Chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the Rings call home. This is the world-shaping, massive scope, good-and-evil-journey stuff that seems especially hard to create without falling into the beloved and reliable — yet at this point all too familiar — framework that Tolkien established. When it succeeds, it still feels somewhat derivative, and when it fails, the result can be as distressing as the Eragon series, a body of work that likely taught young readers that a book can be awful.
Fortunately, though, the recent trend has been to challenge the genre’s accepted norms. Two especially successful examples come to mind, one that has broken through to massive commercial acclaim, and one that hasn’t. The former is George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, which despite beginning more than 15 years ago, has only now truly exploded in the public consciousness. The series characterizes itself by being as un-Tolkien-esque as possible. The world is brutal, motivations are anything but heroic, presumed lead characters can die for trying to do the right thing and there’s heaps of violence and sex thrown in for good measure.
Thanks to HBO’s adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire in the Game of Thrones series, Martin’s world and his characters are reaching a far broader audience than ever before, an audience that has become totally invested in a story that challenges so many preconceived notions of what epic fantasy is supposed to address. Many have sought out the original books and found them deeply compelling springboards back into the kind of quality genre writing that hasn’t gotten mainstream attention since the Harry Potter series.
Those interested in reading more in the vein of Martin would do well to look into the second modern fantasy writer who has the potential to become just as popular somewhere down the line. Since putting out his first book The Blade Itself six years ago, British author Joe Abercrombie has earned an extremely dedicated following who finds his intensely dark, morally ambiguous and occasionally twisted sensibilities to be the Holy Grail of what modern fantasy is capable of achieving. Though he’s relatively new to the game, he more than makes up for it by releasing work at a speed that far outpaces that of his contemporaries — this week’s release of the highly anticipated Red Country marks his sixth novel in as many years — and a writing style with more wit, grit and personality than just about anything on the market. He hasn’t yet earned the attention of readers outside the fantasy circle, but if he maintains his quality and pace, it’s just a matter of time.
Frankly, it can’t happen soon enough, because whenever epic fantasy tries to break new ground, it’s usually assessed in terms of how closely to Tolkien it adheres. But with writers constantly adding their own brand of complexity and style, soon that standard might start to change so that fans will discover every type of story the genre can offer.

With students wearing his signature “Mac hats” and sweatshirts across campus, stickers plastered all over school buildings and a new deal to sell clothing on the popular underground fashion website Karmaloop, USC junior Raymond Courtney’s start-up business, Macnificent Collection, is taking off.

In August, Courtney presented the London 2012 Olympic collection of his Macnificent clothing line at the Magic Tradeshow in Las Vegas to potential buyers and more than 5,000 clothing brands from more than 80 international countries. He left the trade show with a deal to sell his clothing on Karmaloop in the future.
“I’m really excited about selling our entire collection on the Karmaloop site,” Courtney said. “This will only help us to have more success and generate more accounts because it will help boost our credibility and awareness of becoming an up-and-coming brand.”
Courtney said he hopes people wear the brand because they have a personal relation to it — not just because it’s a popular line.
“It’s all about being great and it’s not connected to individuals, not about mackin’ the ladies,” Courtney said. “I want people to believe in the brand and wear it not because it’s a trend but because it represents them as an individual and being Macnificent within themselves.”
The Macnificent brand represents ordinary people who exhibit MACnificence in their everyday lives by promoting individuality, literacy and entrepreneurship. The streetwear brand released its snapback Mac Hats with their “MAC” logo on the front last Tuesday.
But despite the line’s success, Courtney didn’t always have an interest in fashion. After his father’s stroke in 2009, Courtney was interested in studying neuroscience;  however, his passion for design, fashion and entrepreneurship drove him to pursue fine arts at USC in the fall of 2010.
Founded in 2003, Courtney and his brother, Martel Courtney, built Macnificent from the ground up. What was started as a fun fashion hobby between high school friends evolved as the business grew to house deliveries and online purchases. The Courtney brothers have now turned their home in Norwalk into their in-house factory, where they distribute to local stores throughout Los Angeles, including iVogue on Melrose Avenue and Metro Fusion in the Fox Hills Mall. Raymond Courtney has also presented his line at various college campus fashion shows for Cal State, USC’s Gearfest and the USC Fashion Industry Association.
“[There was a hip-hop group] called Dipset [consisting of Cam’ron, Juelz Santana, Jim Jones and Freekey Zekey] that used to have these crazy airbrush designs so I decided to go home and create my own styles,” Raymond Courtney said. “I was just doing it to be cool, but my brother stuck with it and studied fashion design to where one day he created this standout sweater we called the Mac Cyborg.”
Macnificent’s original sweater features a Cyborg face with features that spell out “Mac” and the signature elbow pads that help them stand out as a brand. The sweatshirts, shirts and snapbacks target young adults of both genders.
The Courtney brothers work on all elements of the clothing line. From sketching designs, creating the website, making the tees, taking the photographs and managing the modeling by current USC students, the brothers handle all aspects of running a small business.
“I like to wear the Mac hats and shirts,” said Naod Ephraim, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration who has modeled for the brand. “The Macnificent brand provides and represents the next generation of underground and hip-hop fashion.”
Last summer, Raymond Courtney’s start-up was chosen to be a part of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies’ Accelerator+Incubator+Mentoring Summer Program for promising start-ups. Out of the 18 student start-ups selected to be a part of the program, Macnificent was one of the six chosen to receive $15,000 in financial support and mentorship from USC Marshall School of Business faculty and successful entrepreneurs and incubation.
Raymond Courtney plans on using the services provided by the USC Marshall AIM program to continue working on the fall collection. Though the start-up requires a lot of unforeseen hard work and effort that must be balanced with his studies, Raymond and Martel Courtney feel that it’s worth it and are willing to invest everything into their brand.
“The brand is going in a direction I couldn’t ever imagine,” said Martel Courtney. “From selling on the streets, online and stores, it’s a good feeling to see hard work and dedication pays off — no short cuts. Macnificent will be the next best brand coming out of the west.”
 
The Macnificent clothing collection can be purchased on MacnificentCollection.com.

This week, China elected new members of their Communist leadership. More than 1 million Israelis had to sleep in bomb shelters because of the Gaza conflict. President Barack Obama began the first week of his second term. But the news that received the most extensive media coverage this week? Former CIA Director David Petraeus’ extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.
The inordinate amount of attention the affair and Petraeus’ resignation are receiving illustrates the media’s inclination toward sensationalist journalism, which distracts from more pressing issues. Though it’s important for media outlets to keep public figures in check, they need to realize the line between real news and private matters.
Granted, there are legitimate reasons for people to be upset about Petraeus’ affair that merit media attention. For a man with access to such sensitive information, an affair certainly could lead to a national security threat. In addition, the fact that Petraeus used an easily accessible personal Gmail account to communicate with Broadwell is definitely a red flag, pointing to a lack of discretion on his part. But no matter how the story is spun, it’s not the biggest issue on the nation’s plate.
The FBI has looked into the affair as far back as to when Petraeus and Broadwell first met in 2006, and still has found nothing that constitutes a threat to national security. And as for Petraeus’ professional record, it is clear that his affair had a minimal impact on his effectiveness as CIA director or as a four-star general.
In the aftermath of the scandal and Petraeus’ resignation, the media hasn’t acted as a watchdog, but instead has taken a purely personal affair and turned it into news. Many media outlets have been speculating about the political impact of the affair — a situation unrelated to Petraeus’ work as CIA director — and have been attempting to tie together the personal and professional Petraeus’ to frame the affair as a significant incident. The New York Daily News, for example, posted a story titled “The Taliban is amused by the Petraeus sex scandal,” implying that the affair somehow relates to terrorism, which, on any level, is pointless to bring up. Some stories have been published that characterize Petraeus’ personal actions as a violation of military code, others suggest that Broadwell might have had access to sensitive information simply because she was close to Petraeus, not because of any actual evidence he shared information with her. These angles attempt to add legitimacy to stories fit only for tabloids.
This kind of sensationalist journalism is difficult to prevent; it sells newspapers and gives journalists something to analyze and write about. What’s dangerous about sensationalist journalism, however, is that it distracts readers from more pertinent and newsworthy issues. Petraeus, for example, will appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Friday to testify about the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, but a Google News search of his name produces an entire page of articles related only to the sex scandal and his resignation.
Not only has sensationalism distracted from important current events, but also from Petraeus’ well-established, valuable service record. Retired Lt. Col. John L. Cook, who served in Afghanistan, described this in a Nov. 15 Daily Beast article.
“That isn’t the story that Americans should be paying as much attention to right now,” Cook said. “What matters more was what Petraeus did as a commander, not what he did in the bedroom.”
Taking into consideration the recent presidential election, developments in Israel and the Middle East, China’s changing leadership and the overall poor state of the global economy, there are many issues that deserve the media and Americans’ attention more than Petraeus’ personal life. The media, as the main drivers of public thought and awareness, should remember its primary role as the supplier of truth and knowledge, not entertainment.

From former President Bill Clinton to Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Sen. John Edwards, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and most recently, former CIA director David Petraeus, the media has often blurred the line between private and public lives when it comes to public officials’ extramarital affairs.
The sensationalism of a high-profile sex scandal is inevitable and is what grabs most people’s attention, but the media  plays a less visible, though far more important role in such situations. Though the media’s sensationalist over-reporting of Petraeus’ extramarital affair has dominated the news cycle this week, it stems from a function that is crucial to recognize and maintain: the media’s role as watchdog.
On Nov. 9, Petraeus announced his resignation as CIA director, openly acknowledging his sexual infidelity with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. This immediately opened up the media floodgates. The fact that this was the CIA director — not a senator, governor or even president — brought up questions not only of personal and professional morality, but also of national security and the possibility that classified documents had been shared with Broadwell. A multi-year story unfolded, beginning with Broadwell and Petraeus’ first meeting in 2006 to May of this year, when the FBI, while looking into complaints from another woman about Broadwell and Petraeus, stumbled upon emails between the two indicating their affair.
It is not the media’s role to entertain the public with the sordid details of an extramarital affair, but it is its responsibility to find out what happened after public admittance of an affair and to provide the public the truth, so citizens can form decisions about their public leaders. This was especially pertinent in the case of Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in 1998, when the former president’s private decisions led to his very public impeachment.
Without the media digging and exposing information about Clinton, Petraeus or any other public official, the already-deep vacuum of accountability for politicians and public figures’ personal lives would be even deeper. The frequency with which high-profile sex scandals take place — especially ones more serious than extramarital affairs, such as former Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s involvement in a prostitution ring or the sexual assault case brought against former managing director of the International Monetary Fund Dominique Strauss-Kahn — necessitates the watchdog presence of the media.
Additionally, the media’s role in serving as watchdog is crucial when it can help spark change. And in this particular situation, news outlets are uniquely positioned to do just that. Sexual infidelity is a huge problem in society — and so are rape and sexual assault in the U.S. military. The 2011 Department of Defense’s Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military, which only began in 2004, estimated that there were 19,000 incidents of sexual assault in the fiscal year 2011. According to the same report, in 2010, 1,025 actions were taken by commanders on the grounds of sexual assault. In 2011? Only 791.
The media should seize this chance to take a closer look at the sexual ethics of military leaders and expose much more serious issues than extramarital affairs. If the justice system within the military isn’t working, then it is the media’s responsibility to step in, investigate and expose this flawed system. That is something of true public interest that merits the media crossing into public officials’ private lives.
In the case of Petraeus’ affair, there was no criminal activity involved nor a breach of security that made an impact on a four-star general’s impressive career. But there was a breach in morality that stretches far beyond Petraeus specifically, and that is something the media has a responsibility to investigate and expose. The media should not just focus on the scandalous, sensational details, but take this opportunity to prove itself as watchdog and dig into much deeper, more pressing issues currently impacting the military as a whole.

Every relationship is based on trust and when that trust is violated, so too is the relationship. This is particularly true when speaking of the “public trust” we invest in our leaders. Not to demonize the man, but if Mr. Petraeus is willing to betray his partner in life, what do suppose he’s willing to do to the rest of us?  This isn’t about titillating gossip. This is about something substantially more important – trust.
