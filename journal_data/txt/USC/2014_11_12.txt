In May 1978, National Geographic published a story by Robyn Davidson, a 27-year-old woman who had just completed a 1,700-mile, nine-month trek across the stark, largely uninhabited Australian Outback.
The trip was intended to be a solo endeavor, and for the most part, Davidson tackled the Outback alone. She was occasionally joined by photographer Rick Smolan, who photographed Davidson for the magazine, however.
Impressive feats such as Davidson’s are usually highly documented, but the stories of the documenters themselves often go untold. “Inside Tracks: Behind the Lens on the Assignment of a Lifetime,” the newest exhibit at the the Annenberg Space for Photography Skylight Studios, focuses on the complex relationships between photographers and their subjects and retells the story of Davidson’s journey through Smolan’s eyes, or “lens.”
Since the initial magazine article, Davidson’s story has been retold through a variety of platforms, beginning with her memoir Tracks. Smolan then published his own book, From Alice to Ocean, offering readers their first glance at Smolan’s personal experience in the Outback.
The Annenberg exhibit comes after the release of Tracks, a new motion picture offering the latest adaptation of Davidson’s story. The film places an increased focus on Davidson and Smolan’s relationship.
“Inside Tracks” effectively weaves together the various retellings of Davidson’s story while simultaneously providing an inclusive, interactive experience for visitors. Skylight Studios lends out iPods, which are preloaded with a QR reader and the app Aurasma to visitors. The QR reader is useful at the exhibit’s focal point, a large map tracing Davidson’s journey from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean. Visitors can follow the route and learn the details of the development of Davidson’s trip, as well as the development of her relationship with Smolan.
Different locations on the route are marked with QR codes. Each marked location also includes an image and a short description of an event that occurred at the location. Images include both Smolan’s original pictures and pages from Smolan’s personal diary during the trip, which offer increased transparency for visitors. Diary entries highlight the lesser known aspects of Smolan’s relationship with Davidson.
This added insight shows that Davidson at first was wary to be photographed by Smolan. One of Smolan’s diary entries reads, “She has gotten quite used to [being photographed], even enjoys it although she isn’t quite sure why. She told me she found herself wondering if she was vain because she enjoyed being photographed.”
With the QR reader, visitors glean even more information from each marked location, as scanning QR codes unlock additional commentary from Smolan. Smolan’s commentaries range from the technical, with “[doing a silhouette] is actually really easy, you just need the light to be very low against the horizon,” to the personal, with, “I always felt like a phony, because I didn’t study photography.”
In addition to the map, the exhibit features several digital slideshows showcasing Smolan’s original photos of Davidson. But these aren’t just slideshows — when iPods running the app Aurasma are held up to the photos, the iPod cues a scene from the Tracks film that corresponds with the scene in the photo, linking Smolan’s original work to its newest adaptation.
The exhibit also includes a 15-minute documentary on the movie’s production with even more commentary from both Smolan and Davidson on their relationship and the trip itself, as well as how the experience affected the rest of their respective lives. For visitors, this provides more intimate information and fills in any questions about the journey that they might have after experiencing the rest of the exhibit. For those who read the initial 1978 article, the documentary offers a unique opportunity to hear from the article’s subjects more than 30 years after it’s initial publication.
The Skylight Studios exhibit took special care not to forget the original article amid the flurry of new media adaptations of Davidson’s story; special edition reprints of the May 1978 National Geographic are available for visitors to read. This allows visitors to effectively track the growth of Davidson’s story from the article where it all began, to the new motion picture.
Davidson’s story has now been retold in various ways across many platforms, yet somehow it still hasn’t gotten old. “Inside Tracks” doesn’t merely display old photos; it also showcases the growth of media capabilities. The exhibit’s addition of new technology to Davidson’s story not only connects visitors, it weaves the various retellings of the same story across different perspectives and media together into one compelling narrative — utilizing everything from a diary circa the 1970s to new iPod applications.
Admission to the Annenberg Space for Photography Skylight Studios is free, and the exhibit runs through Feb. 1. The Annenberg Space for Photography Skylight Studios is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.

I should start this review by saying I love experimental artists. At times, I don’t necessarily love their music, but I love that they push boundaries in the pursuit of new sounds, and that is why I love Azealia Banks.
Worth the wait · Azealia Banks found success with her 2011 single “212,” but her album took a long time to finally be released. Now that Broke with Expensive Taste has finally come out, however, she has not disappointed. – Photo courtesy of Prospect Park
Her first single, “212,” came out three years ago, and instantly found an audience with its raunchy lyrics and unique composition. Now, she has finally graced the world with her debut album, Broke With Expensive Taste. It’s by no means perfect and reflects an artist who has struggled with balancing her personal life with her craft, but Banks’s sound is like nothing I’ve heard before, and her album is worth listening to, if only because one of her many genre-ambiguous tracks that finds its way into your heart.
Spanning three years of Banks’s life, Broke With Expensive Taste explores many experimental sounds and includes everything from Latin beats to stomp the yard-esque snares, but the one constant is Banks’ unwillingness to conform. Banks sings along the melodies’ off-beats with a signature lyricism that constantly pushes her songs forward and uses every instrument imaginable. It is not unheard of to hear only a xylophone and 808s, just like it is not unheard of for Banks to employ this signature singing style to a Latin track, speaking Spanish for half a song. “212” was an instant hit because Banks did not let up, pushing a strong backbone and borderline offensive lyrics, but her lack of control with her words has put her in hot water over the years, arguably tanking her career.
Banks has run into trouble many times since she first stepped on the scene, burning bridges with artists all across the music industry with her abrasive social media usage and lack of filter. She has attracted media attention because of disputes with everyone from T.I. to Perez Hilton, and has shown little remorse while bashing artists like Disclosure and Pharrell, slowly shrinking her fanbase until her newest album, which was announced with only a tweet.
“Voila!!!! Here it is… ‘Broke With Expensive Taste!’ … Enjoy!”
Her marketability has tanked due to her unrelenting public image, but there are plenty of artists who rely solely on their music to save their careers, and in a way it’s admirable. Chief example: Kanye West. Arguably the most accomplished artist of the decade, West is also one of the most disliked artists in the world. He does little to change his arrogant image, but with all he has accomplished his fanbase is still as strong if not stronger than when he released his first album. West and Banks let their music speak for them, and this album certainly speaks volumes for Banks’s musical ability.
One song that truly shows Banks’s ability to experiment and find success is the second track on Broke With Expensive Taste, “Gimme a Chance.” Employing aspects of disco and house in the first half of the track and then switching in to marimba and Latin dance music in the latter half, the song is all over the place. Through all this, the New York native ties the song together with her lyrical ability. She even begins to sing in Spanish at the switch and does so flawlessly, connecting both parts of the song in a way I think only she could. Every song is wildly different yet intricately connected, demonstrated by the fact that the song directly after “Gimme a Chance,” titled “Desperado,” employs an old school hip-hop beat and otherworldly tones but somehow feels comfortable directly after the Latin track.
Banks had an impossible amount of resistance while crafting her album, especially with her label Interscope Records who eventually dropped the project. Luckily, when Banks was let out of her contract, she was allowed to take all her tracks recorded with her, which make up most of the album. Her style is certainly eclectic, and without a solid social image, it is clear that Interscope simply didn’t know how to handle the young artist. Thankfully Banks finished her album, and it is miles ahead of anything I’ve heard in the last year in sound. This is not to say that every song is a hit, but that the genre-bending style Banks is so apt to employ is the future of the industry.
Listeners are increasingly looking for the next big thing, and Banks is it. She melds genres in a way no other artist can and does so with so much spunk and style that it feels completely natural despite being completely unique. In a culture based on short attention spans, Banks captures listeners in a way that many artists haven’t. Based in Harlem, a melting pot of music culture, Banks absorbed everything around her, and her album reflects this fusion, making it one of the most interesting listens of the year.

Say the words “Boyce Avenue” and anyone vaguely familiar with YouTube musicians will instantly jump out of their seats in sheer excitement. The superstar trio of brothers, renowned for their soulful acoustic covers of popular songs and original music, is the most-viewed independent band on YouTube and has stolen the hearts of many fans around the world. But they haven’t stopped there.

Boyce Avenue is currently on a North American tour to promote its latest EP, “No Limits,” and is ready to charm its fans at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on Nov. 15. The band will also perform in San Francisco, Dallas, Austin, Houston, Tallahassee and Orlando. Fans will be excited to know that they can expect the versatility, emotional depth and liveliness that has led the band to stardom.
“It will be a little bit of everything,” said Daniel Manzano, vocalist, bass and percussion player and oldest of the three. “We know that when we go see a concert, we love to see the entire dynamic spectrum. The band will be happy and dancing, but they’ll also have emotional moments that connect the band to the audience, so we want to do the same things at our shows.”
Daniel Manzano also hinted that concertgoers should expect both original songs in addition to covers and music genres ranging from soulful acoustic sounds to rock. It is evident from their YouTube channel that Boyce Avenue is able to turn any popular song into its own musical narrative.
Known for their heartfelt collaborations with artists like X Factor runner-up Carly Rose Sonenclar and YouTube star Kina Grannis, the band has invited two artists fans might be familiar with to join them on their North American tour. The show will be supported by 2009 American Idol winner Kris Allen and will feature pop artist and songwriter Curtis Peoples.
Even though the band has reached international recognition since the conception of its YouTube channel, its origins are humble. The Florida-based band, consisting of brothers Daniel, Alejandro (lead vocals, guitar, piano) and Fabian Manzano (guitar, vocals), was formed when the three brothers reconnected after pursuing their own paths in higher education. After Daniel moved back to Florida following his graduation from Harvard Law School, the Manzano brothers began to make music together, recording covers of their favorite songs and posting them online.
Boyce Avenue has since become a global music presence. Their most popular videos have reached more than 30 million views, including acoustic versions of Justin Timberlake’s “Mirrors,” Miley Cyrus’s “We Can’t Stop” and Bruno Mars’ “When I Was Your Man.” The band has 6.4 million subscribers on YouTube, surpassing that of Beyoncé and Lady Gaga, and was even invited to open for British pop band One Direction during their debut “Up All Night” tour.
“No Limits” was released in April 2014, their first since 2010. It features seven tracks and a collaboration with dance producer/D.J. Milkman.
As expected, recording a video and singing live in front of a crowd are completely different experiences. “When you’re playing live, a lot of it is about interplay between you as the band together on stage and you as the band connecting with the audience,” Daniel said.
Because shows allow the band members to meet their supporters, playing live is Daniel’s favorite way of sharing his music. “It’s our chance to bring our music live and play for everybody,” he said.
Despite the band’s evolution, Boyce Avenue’s original formula for success hasn’t changed. Whether the Manzano brothers are performing for an online audience or in front of a live crowd of screaming fans, they have always stayed true to themselves and the music.
“For us, it’s about the music and the message, and I think people can relate to that,” Daniel said. “We really make sure that everything we record is something we’re really passionate about and we think is great. It’s something that people can listen to for the next 20 years of their life. For us, it’s about creating great music and delivering on that passion that we have for our sound and songs.”
Daniel recommends that budding performers look within themselves and perfect something that distinguishes them from the pack.
“I think you have to be yourself and work hard and be consistent. Find what it is that makes you special and work hard at sharing that with the world. A lot of people are all over the place because they don’t ever find that thing that makes them special,” he said.

It is every aspiring screenwriter’s dream to have his or her screenplay picked up and turned into a movie. For Ryan Koehn, a current student in the M.F.A. Writing for Screen and Television program, that dream became a reality after he drafted his first screenplay at the age of 16.
All grown up · Evanne Friedmann (pictured) stars as the main love interest in As Night Comes, a high school drama playing at Laemmle’s Music Hall for a week starting Friday. The film follows the story of a troubled teenager falling into a group of outcasts who call themselves The Misfits. – Photo courtesy of Lauren Lewis
At Koehn’s 16th birthday party an unlikely collaboration was formed with veteran filmmaker, Richard Zelniker.
“[Zelniker] saw that I was getting a lot of screenwriting books as gifts for my birthday because people knew that I was interested in writing. So, I had this big stack of screenwriting books, and he saw those and came over and asked me if I was interested in writing,” Koehn said of his first encounter with Zelniker, which would ultimately lead to the pair co-writing the film As Night Comes.
After four to six months of emailing back and forth with Zelniker, Koehn finished the first draft of As Night Comes, originally titled Mischief Night, and sent it to Zelniker for feedback and advice.
“He mentored me in a lot of ways, and he sent me a lot of scripts that he had written or that had come across his desk and showed me the ropes a little bit,” Koehn said. “I learned an immense amount of information about screenwriting and movies in general in a very short amount of time, and I was very grateful for that.”
As Night Comes follows the story of Sean Holloway, a troubled teenager, who falls in with a group of high school outcasts called The Mistfits, guided by the group’s charismatic leader, Ricky, played by actor Luke Baines (The Ever After). The movie’s climax takes place on the eve of Halloween when Ricky’s chaotic plan spirals into brutality and violence, which ultimately forces Sean to fight for survival and freedom.
Unlike a lot of teenage angst films that are drafted long after a writer has already graduated from high school, As Night Comes has the unique benefit of having been written by Koehn and Zelniker while Koehn was still experiencing high school first hand.
“I look at [As Night Comes] and it definitely feels just torn out of my life at 16. It’s sort of a time capsule in a lot of ways,” Koehn said. “That world was definitely my world at the time, and it influenced a lot of the way that I thought. I’m just thankful that high school’s also a really good place to tell this kind of story, so it’s not something that may have been dated years later. I definitely see a lot of the things that I was thinking about or doing at that time, as far as peer pressure and the people around me.”
Koehn is not the only member of the Trojan family who worked on the project — Evanne Friedmann, a senior majoring in social sciences (psychology), stars as Sean’s love interest, Sarah.
At the beginning of her sophomore year at USC, Friedmann auditioned and won the role of Sarah in the film.
“Sarah is kind of the more mature version of yourself that you wish you were in high school. I wish I were like Sarah in high school,” Friedmann said. “In high school everyone is so insecure. It was everyone’s first time with everything: with love, first time falling in love, first time kissing somebody, first time drinking and fighting and kind of identifying yourself. I had to put myself in the mindset of, ‘This is the first time I am going through this.’”
Though most of Friedmann’s training as an actor has taken place outside of USC, she brings a lot of what she has learned as both a psychology major and from acting classes both on and off campus to her role.
“[My coursework in psychology is] helpful to an extent,” Friedmann said. “It’s obviously beneficial, but it can be dangerous to focus too much on the intellectual side of acting and not on the doing, which is what [acting] really is.”
To prepare for the role, Friedmann re-watched the movie Thirteen, which deals with similar themes of teen angst and identity, and drew from her own high school experience as well.
The difference between the environment of an acting class and actually being on set is significant, and something that Friedmann notes was a great learning experience and opportunity for her while working on the film.
“You don’t get a lot of rehearsal, and you’re just being thrown into something that you accurately and authentically want to portray. It’s a lot of pressure, but I was really glad to experience that in this film.”
As Night Comes will begin its weeklong theatrical release at Laemmle’s prestigious Music Hall in Beverly Hills on Friday, Nov. 14.

Ernest Hemingway often referred to the valley of Val Trebbia in Northern Italy as one of the most beautiful places in the world. Massive green trees dot the valley, while the crystal clear Trebbia River flows slowly through the basin. In this valley sits a small town named Rivergaro, with roughly 7,000 inhabitants. Twice a year, USC sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola returns to her hometown to relax with her family.
Italy’s best · Sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola has racked up 513 assists and 91 digs thus far. Head coach Mick Haley noticed Pizzasegola after the native of Rivergaro, Italy, sent highlight tapes to several NCAA programs. – Matthew Woo | Daily Trojan
 
Pizzasegola fell in love with the river and would do anything she could to stay in the water.
“I think it is my habitat. I can stay in the water for hours and just relax there,” Pizzasegola said. “Every time I see a swimming pool, I just have to jump in it.”
At the age of four, Pizzasegola enrolled in a swimming club called Nuotatori Piacentini. She competed for seven years until she realized that she didn’t like competing against the clock. She still loves to swim, but at the age of 10 she found her true calling: volleyball.
Today, Pizzasegola is a sophomore setter for the USC women’s volleyball team. Already a two-year starter, she has come a long way from her Italian home.
As a little girl, Pizzasegola met former All-American Stanford volleyball player Ogonna Nnamani, who told Pizzasegola to go to the United States after high school to study and play volleyball. Pizzasegola was skeptical and had no idea what would be in store for her.
During her last year of high school, her father asked her about heading overseas. Though this caught her off guard, her dad pushed a little bit, and Pizzasegola started to consider the idea of coming to the United States for college.
Since she was an international student, the recruiting process was extremely difficult. Few college coaches in the United States traveled to Italy to watch her play, so Pizzasegola had to create recruiting videos, send them to colleges and hope that someone liked what they saw.
With a little bit of luck after a setter quit the team, USC had an opening and head coach Mick Haley quickly sent associate head coach Tim Nollan and his wife to Italy to scout Pizzasegola.
“[Nollan] thought she could work into a very good player for us and was a very good team player,” Haley said. “She also really wanted an education in the United States.”
One night, Pizzasegola received a call from Nollan offering her a scholarship to USC. Soon after, she moved halfway around the world to Los Angeles.
Not knowing anyone in the United States, she roomed with fellow freshman teammates Elise Ruddins, Ebony Nwanebu and Taylor Whittingham. On her first night, Pizzasegola went to sleep early because she was jetlagged while the others went out. They returned home with McDonald’s and woke up Pizzasegola. She walked into the kitchen and yelled her first English word to her teammates — nuggets. The nickname has stuck with her.
The next three months would be the hardest she ever faced. Living in a dorm room and feeling homesick, Pizzasegola contemplated returning home to be with her parents and her brother, Filippo. But she found comfort in the gym with her new family, the USC women’s volleyball team.
Being in the States for such a short time, Pizzasegola spoke very little English and had to pick up the language quickly in order to communicate with her teammates on the court. It was difficult for her to learn before an unlikely hero came to her rescue.
“Graduate manager Umberto Gatti is also from Italy, and he could speak fluent Italian with her and got us over the hump,” Haley said. “Umberto [Gatti] was critical in this process because he made her comfortable every day. When she couldn’t understand the English slang he would fill her in and point her in the right direction.”
As she began to learn the language, Pizzasegola became the second setter in USC’s 6-2 offense. During her freshman year she accumulated 701 assists and did what she always wanted to do — contribute.
This thought finally occurred to Pizzasegola in last year’s regional final game against No. 3 Washington.
“It was the biggest game ever,” Pizzasegola said. “I waited my entire life to play in a game like that, and I thought, ‘I am going to play in the most important game of my life.’ We lost, but afterwards I realized I made it. I was still crying but I knew I made it with my teammates, my coaches and by myself.”
Even after that tough loss, what has never faltered on the court has been her attitude. While playing the sport she loves, she can be seen smiling, jumping around after a great play and always staying positive. Her teammates notice and admire her positive attitude.
“She is a strong girl, and she always has fight in her, which is something I really admire,” Ruddins said. “No matter what point it is in the game, she always has that fire in her, and she is so supportive.”
Though this season has not gone exactly the way the Women of Troy wanted it to, Pizzasegola has kept her positivity throughout. She still believes that her team can win a National Championship. So far this season, Pizzasegola has 513 assists and 91 digs.
There is no doubt that Pizzasegola has pushed through obstacles in her life and come out stronger because of them, and always with a smile wide across her face.

In an appropriate reminder of last season’s surprising success, the USC women’s basketball team trounced the Concordia Eagles 120-56 in an exhibition match last Sunday.
V for Victory · Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletema, one of USC’s returning team captains, averaged 8.6 points per game last season. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke revitalized USC last season, leading the team to a 22-13 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. The Women of Troy’s trip to the Big Dance — their first in seven years — was sealed after a stunning run to the Pac-12 Tournament title. Cooper-Dyke expects her squad to improve upon its fifth-place finish in the conference’s regular season standings.
“My expectations are always to get better every single game,” the second-year coach said. “We have a Pac-12 Tournament Championship to defend,”
Cooper-Dyke left her mark on USC as a player by winning two NCAA Championships, the only  two in the program history. As a coach, she continued to make history by leading the Women of Troy to four wins in a four-day span on their way to the aforementioned Pac-12 tourney championship, including an upset of No. 1-seed Stanford in the semifinals.
“Coach Cynthia [Cooper-Dyke] instilled hard work, putting in extra time on and off the court,” senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama said. “It’s the small things that helped us last year and got us to a championship. It’s about holding yourself to a higher standard.”
Vaioletama scored 12 points in the exhibition, one of seven players that reached double digits.
Vaioletama and redshirt sophomore guard Jordan Adams are team captains for the second consecutive year. Last season, Vaioletama averaged 8.6 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. She put up career-high 18 rebounds in a loss to Cal State Northridge on Dec. 10, 2013. Vaioletema’s efforts earned her Pac-12 All-Defensive Honorable Mention.
Adams was a McDonald’s All-American and a WBCA All-American out of high school, and earned a Pac-12 All-Academic Honorable Mention last season.
“I worked extremely hard over the summer,” Adams said. “I did my individual workouts, but it was more of a mentality thing. Stepping up as a leader, setting and example on and off court. For me, it was about being the go-to person.”
Despite a few early field goals, the Women of Troy suffocated Concordia’s offense for the majority of the game, forcing 30 turnovers and grabbing 53 total rebounds.
“It’s a process and it’s a mentality,” first-year associate head coach Beth Burns said. “Those of us that really appreciate the defensive side of the ball get rather insulted when people say defense is just hustle.”
All five of USC’s newcomers made their presence known on the hardwood Sunday. Freshman forward Kristen Simon was the Women of Troy’s top-scorer, finishing with 19 points and 15 rebounds.
“It felt good,” Simon said. “I had surgery in the summer, so it’s been a long time since I played a game. The support from my teammates helped me out, so it felt good going back out there.”
The Women of Troy looked like a cohesive unit, even without Kate Oliver, Cassie Harberts and Ariya Crook. Oliver and Harberts were lost to graduation, and Crook was dismissed from the team because of a university and team policy violation. Cooper-Dyke says that moving on without Crook’s contributions will be a team effort. “It gives an opportunity for other people — Jordan Adams, Alexyz Vaioletama, Kaneisha Horn — other players to really step up into that role.” Cooper-Dyke said. “I’m going to look for them and lean on them to really step their game up.”
Along with the five new players, Burns and new assistant coach Taja Edwards make their debut at Troy this season.
The Women of Troy have a challenging road trip ahead of them to begin the regular. On Saturday, they face No. 2 South Carolina. The Gamecocks finished first in the SEC last season, eventually making it all the way to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament.
Historically, USC has yet to win a game against South Carolina, with the two teams’ most recent meeting resulting in a 70-50 Gamecock win at the Galen Center last season. South Carolina’s leading scorer, Aleighsa Welch, returns this season, hoping to improve upon her 30.5 points per game mark from 2013-2014. Welch earned an All-American Honorable Mention last season and was named to the SEC All-Freshmen Team. Cooper-Dyke knows that beating “the other USC” will not be easy.
“We go on the road with number two in the nation, the University of South Carolina,” Cooper-Dyke said. “That’s gonna be a pretty tough game to start with.”
On Monday, USC will head to North Carolina to face the Davidson Wildcats. Both of the Wildcats top scorers from a season ago — Hannah Early and Dakota Dukes — will return this year. Early led the team with 31.2 points per game last season.
Cooper-Dyke is shooting for the upper-echelon of the Pac-12 and sees all opponents as a stepping-stone to prepare the Women of Troy for the rigor of the conference.
“All of those games are gonna help to get us ready for a very tough Pac 12 schedule,” she said.
Vaioletama admitted that her teammates feel that they must prove their conference tournament win was not a fluke.
“It’s gonna be tough this year,” Vaioletema said. “We haven’t gained that respect from last year for winning the Pac-12 tournament. We have to prove something; we have something to prove.”

What about Nelson Agholor?
The response struck me as odd, definitely more so than it should have. I was in the middle of a text exchange with my friend Matt, and the topic had shifted to Trojan football. Matt — a rabid Cal fan — asked me who I thought was USC’s best football player, regardless of position.
“It’s gotta be Leonard Williams,” I answered.
He got game · Junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor leads USC in receptions (66), receiving yards (863) and receiving touchdowns (8) this season. The Tampa, Florida, native has 2,121 career receiving yards. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
It seemed like a no-brainer. The junior defensive end is already a two-time all-Pac-12 selection, an All-American and very well could be the first overall pick of next spring’s NFL draft.
“Yeah, Williams is a beast, but I don’t know,” my friend replied.
I wasn’t really sure what Matt was getting at, so I threw out a few names. Sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens is an absolute force of nature and could be playing on Sundays in a few years. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler has quietly developed into one of the nation’s best signal callers. Maybe my friend was hinting at redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, the Pac-12’s leading rusher and a “potential candidate” for the Heisman Trophy — whatever that means. Then Matt mentioned Agholor.
At first, the idea threw me. Sure, the junior wideout is having another outstanding season, but he’s been somewhat overshadowed by Allen and Kessler. And you can’t just ignore what Cravens and Williams have done on defense. I wasn’t convinced.
“Remember last year’s game [at Cal]?” Matt said. “Watch those highlights and tell me Agholor isn’t the best player on the field.”
With some recollection of USC’s 62-28 win, I figured that I might as well look at some film. I recommend that all USC fans do the same.
Less than two minutes into the contest, Agholor took a punt return 75 yards to the house. The Bears’ coverage team never touched him. Agholor simply ran around everyone. It looked like he was playing against a high school team.
Fast-forward to the second quarter. Another punt return touchdown, this one from 93 yards out. I think one Cal defender might have gotten a hand on him that time. It’s hard to tell. Either way, Agholor turned a Pac-12 special teams unit into mincemeat twice in a span of less than 25 minutes, so I was fully ready to consider him among USC’s best players. Clearly, his versatility and special teams prowess set him apart. But how much does he actually bring to the table as a receiver? A lot, as it turns out.
Agholor’s numbers are eye-opening. Sixty-six receptions, 863 yards and eight touchdowns through nine games. Nearly 30 more catches than any other Trojan. Two more punt return touchdowns, bringing his career total to four — a USC record. He’s the definition of a No. 1 receiver, a freak athlete who makes Kessler’s job infinitely easier and gives opposing defensive coordinators nightmares. Funnily enough, that’s where the numbers don’t tell the whole story.
As SB Nation’s California Golden Blogs detailed earlier this week, Agholor’s biggest impact often comes when he doesn’t even touch the ball. His speed forces defensive backs to stick to him like glue on deeper routes, allowing Kessler the freedom to find other targets — such as Allen, freshman wideout JuJu Smith and freshman tight end Bryce Dixon — open on in the flat. On the flip side, when Agholor is able to find space downfield, there’s no safety in the conference that can keep up with him (sorry Washington State). Though it might be unfair to say that Agholor drives the USC offense, it’s not hard to argue that the threat of the Tampa, Florida, native is the key cog in head coach Steve Sarkisian’s well-oiled machine.
When it’s all said and done, this discussion really doesn’t matter. More than anything, what matters is Agholor’s value to the Trojans as a team, both in his production and his experience. Early in the first quarter of USC’s 28-26 win over Arizona on Oct. 11, he dropped a pass that would’ve extended the team’s opening drive. Agholor was visibly upset after the play, and though he would go on to pick up seven receptions for 81 yards and a touchdown, was not happy with his performance.
How did he react? Six catches for 128 yards and a career-high three touchdowns against Colorado the next week.
On Oct. 25, Agholor stepped out of bounds on a crucial fourth-and-2 against Utah, allowing the Utes to start a game-winning drive. It was a devastating play and a devastating loss, one that served as a gutcheck to the entire team. And how did Agholor react? Racking up a career-high 220 receiving yards against Washington State in USC’s next game.
This resilience is invaluable to the Trojans, and one of the reasons why Nelson Agholor very well may be the team’s best player. Someday, maybe someday soon, Agholor is going to bring those talents to the next level. But of course, he isn’t thinking about that.
“I’m still worried about Cal right now,” Agholor told the L.A. Times earlier this week. “All I want to do is beat Cal.”

With USC’s only weeknight matchup of the season looming, Daily Trojan sports editor Will Hanley asked Daily Cal football writer Riley McAtee a few questions about the state of the Bears.
He went to Jared · Cal quarterback Jared Goff is in position to lead the nation in passing yards. Goff has 3,119 yards through nine games. – Photo courtesy of Cal Athletics
DT: Cal’s offense has been impressive in every game this year except for a 31-7 loss to Washington on Oct. 11. What did the Huskies do that game to successfully stop the Bears?
DC: The Washington defensive line definitely feasted on the Bears that day, especially when it came to getting to Jared Goff. The final score might not show it, but Cal did effectively move the ball in this game — to the tune of 368 yards, just 16 fewer than the Huskies themselves. The difference is that Goff was sacked four times, and the Bears fumbled the football five times, losing it on two of those.
It’s hard to win any football game with three lost fumbles, and those turnovers often put an end to the Cal drives that otherwise looked effective, with the most obvious example being Shaq Thompson’s 100-yard fumble return touchdown. That’s a 14-point swing on one play, and it basically set the tone for the entire game.
Goff can move in the pocket better than he’s often given credit for, but he’s still not great when he faces pressure for an entire game. And it’s not like fumbling issues are new for him, he had the same kind of problems show up against Oregon last season. The difference is that game was in the pouring rain — against Washington, the Huskies just hit him a few too many times.
DT: Quarterback Jared Goff gets a lot of credit for being Cal’s offensive firepower, but running back Daniel Lasco has fairly quietly had an excellent season fairly quietly. How crucial is this balance for the Bears?
DC: The resurgence of the running game has been the most encouraging sign of the season for Cal faithful. Coach Sonny Dykes brought his brand of the Air Raid offense last year but promised that he ran something that was more balanced. He might be a disciple of Mike Leach, but Dykes isn’t trying to pass the ball 75 percent of the time. And indeed when Dykes was at Louisiana Tech, he did have a balanced offense that ran the ball almost as much as it passed it.
Last year, Cal ended up airing the ball out in almost every game, but that was more a product of a defense that put the Bears behind literally every single week. The Bears have been much more balanced this year, and Lasco has certainly been a part of it. His emergence has given the Bears the ability to find balance — last year they didn’t find a trustworthy feature back between Brendan Bigelow and a weird experiment that saw then-wide receiver Richard Rodgers in the backfield. Lasco can do a bit of everything — run, catch, block — which allows the team to keep him out there all the time. And that balance really showed against Oregon State — when Goff had a down day it was Lasco that carried the team to a win. That never would have happened last year.
DT: After a 1-11 season in 2013, many Cal supporters were unhappy with head coach Sonny Dykes. Has Dykes’ second season settled those concerns, and do you see him as the long term answer in Berkeley?
DC: It’s still hard to say. I generally reserve judgement on coaches for at least three seasons. So far he has begun to find a solution to the poor test scores and graduation rates of Cal’s football team that played a part in Jeff Tedford’s firing in 2012. If those hadn’t improved, I’m sure Dykes would have gotten the axe last year.
That said, I’m not so naive as to think that grades alone will allow Dykes to keep his job. He’ll need wins. Those have come so far this year — the Bears are 5-4 — but can Dykes build a program that will be successful consistently, even after stars like Goff are gone? It certainly appears so, but it’s early. The jury is still out.
DT: With three games remaining (against USC, Stanford and BYU), the Bears need one more win to earn a bowl berth. Where do you see the easiest chance for that win?
DC: I’ll take BYU as the easiest win without Taysom Hill. Plus I just want to see the Bears fight for a bowl berth in their final game — and at home no less! Drama!
DT: USC is as balanced on offense as any team in the Pac-12. Do you have confidence in Cal’s inconsistent defense to keep the Trojans in check?
DC: Not at all. Cal wins by outgunning its opponents, not by stopping them. But that’s what has finally clicked for the Bears this season. Even though Cal’s defense is still terrible, the offense is putting up over 40 points per game. Sometimes the defense doesn’t need to do much, and the offense takes care of the rest. That hasn’t always worked, but there is something to it.
I will say that having a balanced offense doesn’t really help USC, as Cal has been significantly worse against the pass than against the run. And this Trojan team likes to pound the ball, but I think they’ll be better off if they let Kessler air it out in this one.
 
DT: For the Bears to win this game, they need to _______ .
DC: Keep Goff protected. This team lives and dies by its offense, and this offense lives and dies by its quarterback. The offensive line has done a good job this season, but Leonard Williams scares me.
 
DT: Final score prediction?
DC: I’ll go with 45-34, USC.

The USC football team returns to the L.A. Memorial Coliseum for the first time in nearly a month on Thursday night to host the California Golden Bears. The game, which is only the second non-Thanksgiving, non-bowl Thursday game ever played at the Coliseum, will kick off the Trojans’ home stretch, as rivalry matchups against UCLA and Notre Dame await the squad to close out the regular season.
Goldsmith · Freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith will play his first career weeknight game on Thursday night against Cal. Smith caught three touchdowns against Washington State on Nov. 1., a USC freshman record. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The unranked Trojans (6-3, 5-2 Pac-12) are coming off of a bye week following a win at Washington State. In that game, redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler threw for a career-high 400 yards, as well as five touchdown passes and no interceptions. Freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith caught three of those, tying a USC freshman record for most touchdowns in a single game by a freshman.
Smith, Kessler and the rest of the gang enjoyed some well-deserved rest when USC head coach Steve Sarkisian gave the team a week off from practice. This allowed sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens, among others, to heal his wounds. Cravens, USC’s breakout star on defense this season, tweaked his knee in the 44-17 win over the Cougars, but an MRI showed no structural damage, and the explosive defensive back made a quick recovery.
Sarkisian was impressed with the way his team performed during the bye week.
“Going into the Washington State game, we had to give it everything we had to get prepared for that game, mentally, physically and emotionally,” Sarkisian said. “We had been in some physical games, we’d been in some emotional games, and it felt like the break came at a great time for us. We took some time off and came back this week, and I think the guys have been fantastic.”
USC’s defense will certainly need to be in the right shape in order to stop the high-octane offense coming to the Coliseum on Thursday night. The Bears (5-4, 3-4) boast the third-best total offense (509.1 yards per game) in the Pac-12 and the second-best scoring offense (41.9 points per game).
The Bears, who also enjoyed a bye week following a 45-31 win at Oregon State, have quarterback Jared Goff to thank for such inflated numbers. The sophomore gunslinger is averaging 346.6 passing yards per game and has thrown 27 touchdowns and four interceptions.
“Jared [Goff] is a beast,” Cravens said. “I think he came in our class, and he was one of the top passers in the Pac-12, if not the nation, last year, so we’re not sleeping on him. He can definitely throw the ball.”
With Goff commanding Cal’s offense, USC’s inexperienced secondary might be cause for concern. Junior Kevon Seymour has been a stronghold at cornerback, but the safety position has been a bit shaky since Cravens moved to linebacker. Senior Gerald Bowman, sophomore Leon McQuay III and freshman John Plattenburg have all rotated there, but all three are nursing injuries.
The Trojans might take solace in the idea that the best defense is a good offense, because the team has certainly been rolling on that end.
This week, Kessler, who is fourth nationally in completion percentage (69.7) and eighth in passing touchdowns (25), was named one of five finalists for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award.
Though Kessler has flown under the radar most of the season, he earned high praise from his head coach, who is excited for what the Bakersfield, California, native will bring to the table in the last month of the regular season.
“He’s gonna have some really cool opportunities here this last month of the season in November to have a couple of these maybe defining-type moments,” Sarkisian said. “The key for us and the key for Cody is to capitalize on them — to make the most of them, to be at our best at the most critical moments. And we’re gonna need him to be if we want to accomplish what we think we’re capable of accomplishing.”
Kessler will certainly need to be on his game to match Goff’s keen anticipation skills. But Cal’s defense — statistically the worst in the conference — might have a hard time containing him.
The Bears rank last in passing and total defense, but are slightly better as a run-stopping unit.
USC’s redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, though, might have something to say about that. The Tallahassee, Florida, native, who leads the Pac-12 in rushing yards per game, has eclipsed 100 rush yards in the last six games, prompting the Heisman committee to tab him as a potential candidate for this year’s award.
Last year in Berkeley, Allen had his way with the Bears’ defense. He amassed 135 rushing yards and scored two touchdowns — on just six carries. He also hauled in a 57-yard receiving touchdown on USC’s way to a 62-28 blowout.
Cal’s Daniel Lasco, though, has also emerged as a viable running back this year. His 88.44 yards per game ranks seventh in the Pac-12, but his 10 touchdowns rank second.
USC’s front seven, which includes tried-and-true linebacker Hayes Pullard and All-American defensive end Leonard Williams, will have their hands full stopping Lasco and trying to get to Goff before his quick release. Goff’s 260 yards and three touchdowns weren’t enough to overcome the Trojans in last year’s matchup, which ended up being Cal’s 10th straight loss to USC.
USC has not lost to Cal in the Coliseum since 2000 and looks to keep thatstreak going tonight at 6 p.m.

Pick-up artist Julien Blanc has a “Ph.D. in female attraction,” or so the infamous “dating coach” claims. In truth, Blanc works for Real Social Dynamics, an American company specializing in teaching men how to win women over.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
 
Real Social Dynamics, however, is more than just a male version of Cosmopolitan. A recent video depicts Blanc instructing men to “just go through Tokyo, grab girls and yell ‘Pikachu’ and put her head on your d-ck” before providing footage of him doing just that. As if this weren’t horrific enough, Blanc manages to bring race into the mix as well, proclaiming, “At least in Tokyo, if you’re a white male, you can do what you want.”
The video has garnered a good deal of online backlash, but, in the wake of Emma Watson’s recent speech to the United Nations, the company’s existence is all the more significant. Real Social Dynamics is the antithesis to the contemporary feminist movement, promoting misogyny, violence and racial stereotyping.
As for Blanc himself, the “dating coach” glorifies sexual violence on social media, where he posts photos of himself positioning women in chokeholds. “#ChokingGirlsAroundTheWorld” seems too preposterous to be real, but it is. In her article for the Guardian, Somayya Ismailjee points out, “These men epitomise the rabid culture of male entitlement and the toxic social enabling of violent hypermasculinity that puts women in danger every day.” Of course, Blanc’s actions are not the norm, but this glaring extreme proves that rape culture is still alive and well. Says Ismailjee, “That Blanc can sustain a profitable business out of promoting sexual violence with total impunity” reveals “the extent to which our society accepts … abusive attitudes towards women.” After all, what’s terrifying about Real Social Dynamics isn’t Julien Blanc himself so much as the existence of a market for these services. According to Real Social Dynamics’ website, dating “bootcamps” cost anywhere from $2,000 to $2,500, but “the VALUE of this program will MORE than exceed the cost.”
Certainly Blanc’s words in addition to the company’s motives as a whole complicate arguments against feminism. It’s hard to sustain the argument that male support is a no-brainer when men like Blanc are traipsing around Tokyo, grabbing women left and right. Such blatant misogyny weakens arguments such as that of Time magazine’s Cathy Young. In her Sept. 26 article entitled, “Sorry, Emma Watson, but HeForShe Is Rotten for Men,” Young claims that feminism “has too often ignored sexist biases against males, and sometimes has actively contributed to them.”
In the first place, some feminists have discriminated against men in the past, but it isn’t right to judge an entire movement based on extremist members. Watson explicitly states that the entire goal of HeForShe is to “try and galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for gender equality.” Perhaps critics such as Young do not realize that Watson is arguing for the very same thing they are. In her Sept. 20 speech, Watson acknowledged that sexism is harmful to all involved.
“I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less ‘macho,’” Watson said. “In fact, in the U.K., suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20-49 years of age.”
Outdated expectations of masculinity can be as harmful to men as they are to the women they oppress and exclude. Watson acknowledges this in her speech and reminds listeners that feminism, by definition, aims for gender equality. Feminism is not sexism, but increased male accountability is essential in preventing figures like Blanc from perpetuating misogyny. While opponents of feminism are busy nitpicking, calling for a more gender-neutral name for the movement, real women are suffering from violence.
Owen Jones, a columnist at the Guardian, hit the nail on the head in a Sept. 24 article entitled, “Men need to stand together with Emma Watson against misogyny.” Jones cites some of “the terrifying statistics of violence” against women, “that more than a million British women suffer domestic violence a year, that 400,000 women are sexually assaulted annually, while about 85,000 women are raped.” His article also discusses the threat to release nude photos of Emma Watson immediately following her speech to the United Nations. The EmmaYouAreNext website turned out to be a hoax, but the entire scandal only proves Watson’s cause. Recruiting male feminists is essential in a society where women are threatened for speaking out against oppression, but men like Blanc are free to profit off of misogyny.
The integration of male voices into the feminist movement is crucial amid the unceasing patriarchy. In the words of Owen Jones, “A hand has been extended to men: it needs to be firmly grasped.”

As a USC student and a Mexican-American citizen, I feel compelled to share with the Daily Trojan the recent events that have been occurring in the last couple of months in our neighboring country of Mexico.
On Sept. 26, a group of more than 100 students working on their degrees to become teachers went to the city of Iguala, Guerrero to fundraise money for the Ayotzinapa Normal School. That same night, 43 of those students were kidnapped and never seen again after a confrontation with the police. Julio Cesar Mondragon was the only student found the following morning lying on the streets with his face entirely mutilated, a gruesome crime common among the drug cartels.
Thanks to the various protests where the main slogan has been, “You took them alive; we want them back alive,” the government of Mexico saw itself pressured to give its citizens answers. In the search for the students’ bodies, the state of Guerrero has arrested its mayor for his alleged contribution in commanding the attack, as well as police officers who were present during the incident. The forensic police on their part has searched the forests of Guerrero and found 12 clandestine burial sites in total with multiple dead bodies as of Oct. 28, but none of them matching the DNA of the students.
This past Friday, Nov. 7, the Mexican Attorney General Murillo Karam gave a press conference where he confirmed, without any physical evidence, the torture and murder of the missing students by the local police and the drug cartel, Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors). According to the statements of three of the arrested suspects, the students were burned alive in a remote town the same night of their disappearance. The remains will now be sent to the laboratories of the University of Innsbruck to determine their identities. The parents of the students fear that this might be a way to stop any further investigation and demand a credible response. To them and every Mexican citizen, their children are still alive.
The indignation of the Mexican population comes as no surprise. This is a reminiscent crime to the Tlatelolco Massacre on Oct. 2, 1968, where the government in Mexico City commanded the police to persecute and incarcerate high school and university students who where protesting against the policies of the then president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, leading to more than 100 injuries and deaths.
Once again, the government has chosen to sacrifice its youth.
After the controversial disappearance of the 43 students, the truth has emerged bit by bit. Every day new questions arise that leave the Mexican government exposed. Who ordered the police to arrest the students? What is the relationship between the state and the drug cartels? And, why did it take the government more than 40 days to give its citizens a formal response? Perhaps we will never know what truly happened to the students. What is certain is that they were young students like my classmates and myself who hoped to achieve a better life. They were future educators like my professors who understood the power of knowledge. They were, after all, human beings exercising their freedom of speech.
Since the night of the abduction, students from all over the world in countries including the United States, England, France, Australia and India have not ceased to show their support and solidarity through public forums, marches, YouTube videos and blog posts. Whether it is a passerby or someone on the other side of the screen, what is important is that everyone is becoming aware of the gravity of the events occurring in Mexico.
I invite the Daily Trojan not to be left behind and share this misfortune with the rest of the USC community. It might be easy to think that one does not hold the power to intervene in social and political crises of this magnitude, but I believe this is not true. We must claim our right to be respected and to be heard. Silence would only perpetuate a world of crime and corruption — a world in which the Mexican youth live.

Hoy saludo tu escrito que publicaste en Daily Trojan y desde los sentimientos mas dolorosos y las heridas aun no cicatrizadas de aquel 2 de octubre de 1968 donde jóvenes estudiantes fueron masacrados. Te digo lo siguiente:
Que jóvenes que tienen pensamientos de libertad y justicia social como los tuyos se hacen necesarios en estos momentos de infinito dolor para los jóvenes mexicanos, para el pueblo de México y para el corazón destrozado de los padres de familia por no saber el paradero de sus hijos.
Ayotzinapa es la cara de la barbarie de un gobierno que no respeta la vida humana, un gobierno que comete crimen de estado y el cual su común denominador es la simulación ante el mundo entero y apoyados por algunos medios de comunicación y por los poderosos que tienen en sus manos el control del gobierno y el poder económico.
Nahui recuerda que la historia tiende a repetirse y cuando un pueblo se cansa de un gobierno injusto no hay balas que lo detengan ni cárcel ni torturas que no soporte por obtener la libertad que se le ha quitado.
¡Salud Nahui! Aquí estamos no nos rendimos estamos de pie esperando la llegada de los 43 que vivos se llevaron y vivos los queremos.
Recuerda que como mexicanos decimos ¡Que solo el pueblo unido puede salvar al pueblo!.
Profa. Ma. A. Estrella Del Valle Carrión
Oppressive governments throughout history have suppressed protests in this manner and even today, we see this same behavior repeat itself in various regimes around the world.  The perpetrators of this crime in Mexico made examples of those students to show their fellow citizens what would happen if more protests take place in the region.  Disgusting!
This should be a wake-up call for the USA.  We often take our liberty and rights for granted when we should not.  We have a second amendment to the Constitution (right to bear arms) that, by no coincidence, follows the first amendment (freedom of speech and  the right of the people to peaceably assemble, etc).  The second guarantees the first.  Our forefathers knew how oppressive governments could be and we, as good citizens, must exercise these rights or risk losing them altogether.

Yesterday, the United States began offering extended visas to Chinese citizens going to school in the States or visiting from overseas. The deal between the United States and China is an optimistic gauge of the growing economic ties between the two global powerhouses.
Design by Matt Burke 
Applicants are now able to apply for five-year student visas or 10-year tourist and business visas. Before yesterday’s deal, visas had been granted on a year-to-year basis and required long wait times. The White House has said that this change will allow tourism and traveling from China to contribute over $85 billion to the American economy by 2021 and provide nearly 440,000 jobs.  This is an opportunity to strengthen relations between Washington and Beijing.
The former application process for student visas was not only convoluted and ungainly, but also a significant hindrance for students in China to coming to the United States for an education. Often, the line for an appointment in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing would last hours — not the best impression to give people who are interacting with the United States for the first time. The wait time for visas would last a month, and even after the interview is granted, students were questioned in the U.S. Embassy in China on suspicion that they would remain in the United States permanently. The system was so rigid that even the parents of Xinran Ji, the USC student who was tragically killed this past summer near campus, were kept from entering the United States for a week due to bureaucratic complications in obtaining visas. When parents of a slain student are delayed from attending their son’s funeral, the status quo is in need of desperate change. The new process in place will also free up time for students who no longer have to reapply annually and will encourage others to travel to the United States and contribute to the American economy.
Last year, the largest influx of international students into the United States came from China. Visas were granted to 316,000 students, a 12 percent increase from the previous year. Chinese students make up a large population in U.S. colleges and universities that has been growing significantly, and the new deal to expedite visas will make it easier for them to stay for the duration of their education.
USC itself is home to the most international students out of any university in the country. Of the school’s 9,840 international students, 3,771 were from China in the 2012-2013 academic year. To many universities, including USC, the expedition of visas makes it easier to accommodate international students as well as encourage others who might refrain from applying to U.S. colleges because of the issues that arise with obtaining a student visa. Giving international students the chance to receive a quality education in America provides a springboard to new and intriguing opportunities. Obama’s deal with China could be the impetus to accomplish such an ambitious goal.
Critics could argue that providing Chinese students an easier route to a student visa will eliminate spots and opportunities for domestic students to attend universities. With college admission rates at their lowest among top colleges in the United States, it is more competitive than ever to earn a coveted seat in a premier American university. Opponents could also argue 65.9 percent of 2013 high school graduates attend college, and as a result, the United States should be helping its own students attend college before helping international students. There are merits to those arguments. But in their truest form, however, educational opportunities should not discriminate against people by nationality or background.
Since China is home to one of the world’s most rapidly rising economies, it is important for the United States, as well as advantageous for China, to foster and promote a cohesive and amicable relationship that will benefit both parties in economic trade. In California alone, Chinese travelers spent roughly $2 billion last year.
The number of Chinese visitors to California is expected to double by 2017, and this new visa deal will only add to the number of travelers, which means more jobs, more spending and more economic boon for both California and the nation as a whole.
