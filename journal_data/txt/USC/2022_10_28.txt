Believe it or not, it’s been approximately one month since the last installment of “Kacie on K-pop” ran. Since then, a lot has happened in my personal life: a lot of skipped classes, a few therapy sessions and too many iced Dulce lattes to count.
When I’m going through things, I turn to online shopping as one of my main sources of solace. They say money can’t buy happiness, but in the capitalist environment in which we live, sometimes I really think it can. But instead of spending most of my disposable income on food or books, most of my extra funds go toward fueling my love for K-pop — physical CDs and merchandise, clothing and makeup from brands that partner with my favorite artists and concert tickets make up the bulk of my nonessential purchases. 
When I first became a K-pop fan, I was 16 years old with little to no disposable income. The only way I could engage with my idols was by watching the content they released for free on YouTube or V Live or streaming their music on Spotify, and I was OK with that. In fact, I loved it; the night I spontaneously pulled an all-nighter to watch all the episodes of my idols’ variety show in existence is still one of my fondest memories. 
Yet, over time, I began to notice that other fans of my favorite group at the time would trade photo cards with each other (photo cards I never had because I could not buy any albums) or had seen certain types of exclusive content (content I never watched because I could not access it behind their paywalls). Although I had been a fan for a few months at this point, I felt as if my fan credibility was lessened because I wasn’t as dedicated financially to the group’s success. 
While in no way is it mandatory to make these types of purchases to be a fan of a K-pop artist, the unspoken rules of many K-pop fandoms suggest that fans who have money are more valuable, or even considered better, fans to their idols. Not only do these fans have physical items to display as “proof” of being a fan, they also have tangible evidence of their support for their artists — paying for Korean music platform streaming passes to boost their idols’ songs on the charts, or buying memberships to mock text chat platforms to “message” their idols and official fan club memberships to give even more money to their idols’ management companies. These paid activities not only benefit the fan, but in theory, are also a way to give back to their idols. 
Similarly, the lack of opportunities to interact directly with K-pop artists contributes to a culture of clout surrounding fans who are able to pay large sums of money for these opportunities. When fans are “recognized” by their idols for having interacted with them at multiple events or concerts, these fans are often considered “better” and are idolized by other fans. 
During the coronavirus pandemic, many K-pop management companies began offering fansign events virtually. An opportunity for fans to meet their favorite idols in person and get a physical copy of the artists’ album signed, fansigns were traditionally only offered in South Korea, making it extremely difficult for international fans to get the same sort of exposure to their idols without spending a large amount of money to get there. 
Yet, when the events were offered more frequently online, it became very common for global fans to enter and win opportunities to video call their idols. These calls were often screen-recorded and posted online, opening up even more opportunities for fans with more money to be seen as “better” fans than those who didn’t have the financial means to participate in these events. 
I distinctly remember a time during the pandemic when it felt like each one of my friends had participated in a virtual fansign event with their favorite idol, with the screen-recorded videos of calls being all that I would see online. At that time, I hadn’t been able to participate in a similar experience, and admittedly, it did make me question my credibility as a fan, even though I was already spending money on other activities my idols offered and would eventually attend a virtual fansign myself. 
Now, five years after I initially became a fan and, admittedly, a lot of money spent on my favorite artists later, I think it’s interesting to reflect on the tie between money and perceived fan loyalty in the K-pop community. After spending so much of my disposable income on the activities of my idols, you would think that I feel like a “better” fan because of it. 
Am I more loyal to my favorite artists because I’m financially invested in their success? Am I happier when they do well because I feel as if I contributed something to them? Perhaps. 
But when I look back on my time as a K-pop fan, I still believe that the time when I was most dedicated to my chosen artists was at the very beginning — when I was giving them my time more than anything. In the capitalist industry that is K-pop, perhaps it’s time to remember that genuine love is free.

The 0-4 Los Angeles Lakers are pretty dreadful at basketball, but remain great at making history. 
The 2022-23 Lakers now hold the record for the lowest three-point percentage, 22.3%, through the first four games of a season. It’s almost like when a team refuses to sign three-point shooters, they shockingly can’t make threes!
There’s been a lot of negativity surrounding this team, and rightfully so. Should they send Russell Westbrook home? Why did general manager Rob Pelinka get an extension from owner Jeanie Buss? Is LeBron James’ championship window over? Why does Anthony Davis look like he’s 39, not 29?
The topics are endless, but so exhausting. So, let’s try to shed some positive light on this dark, depressing abomination of a Lakers team. Let’s try and fix this team.
What we know
The Lakers have $98 million dollars tied up next year — $93 to LeBron and Davis, with the remaining five split between Damian Jones and rookie Max Christie. The NBA told teams early in September that the cap would rise to $134 million for the 2023-24 season, an 8.4% bump, giving us about $36 million to play with. 
Who do we re-sign?
Despite the Lakers’ incapability to perform on the court, they actually have some productive players on the roster. The losses are not due to a lack of ability — it’s the construction of the squad that is bottom-tier. The great part about resigning players in the NBA is that we can sign them to sizable contracts without dipping into the salary cap, as we have their Bird Rights. So who should we keep around for next season?
Patrick Beverley
Yes, Beverley is 3-16 from three in the first four games of the season, and sometimes it does feel like he’s “running around, doing nothing,” as Westbrook famously noted. But I like his defensive intensity, and if he figures out his long ball yips as a Laker, he can be a useful piece in a smaller role. 
Austin Reaves
Reaves needs more playing time, it’s that simple — 20.8 minutes per game is not enough. Reaves is connecting on 40% of his three point looks, the only player outside of Matt Ryan (No, not the quarterback) who is shooting above 26%. He plays hard defensively, and I like how he fits with  LeBron and Davis. 
Even though Lonnie Walker IV looks like Rajon Rondo from afar, he certainly does not play like the future Hall-of-Famer. Unlike Rondo, Walker IV looks like he can jump to the ceiling of Crypto.com Arena. He brings intensity and youthfulness to this humdrum Lakers squad, so let’s give him another shot on a legitimate team. 
Potential new signings
Kyrie Irving
This one’s a shot in the dark. As the Lakers general manager, I prefer to prioritize high-level role players to surround LeBron and Davis, the 2020 championship formula, but who can say no to a Kyrie Irving-LeBron reunion? If the Nets are bounced out of the first round again, Kyrie may want out of Brooklyn, and L.A. would definitely be his number one destination after the Lakers tried to pry him away from the Nets this summer. He would want our entire $36 million in cap space, and he can have it. We would fill out the roster with veteran’s minimum signings, which may not be ideal, but do you know what is ideal? A Kyrie-LeBron-Davis Big 3. 
Jerami Grant
If we cannot get Kyrie, my next call will be to sign Grant. A “three-and-D” forward that can create his own shot? Sign me up. Grant would likely demand a contract number in the high $20s, giving us just under $10 million to throw at other free agents. 
Myles Turner
The Lakers want to trade Westbrook for Turner before the trade deadline, and for good reason. Davis has never really wanted to bang down low with other centers in the league — Turner can preserve Davis’ body while stretching the floor on the offensive end as a career 34.8% shooter.
Bogan Boganovic
The Lakers reportedly had a chance to snag Bogdanovic, a premium fit next to LeBron and Davis, from the Jazz this offseason, but decided against it for some unknown reason, cough-cough Rob Pelinka. On Wednesday, Bogdanovic hit a flurry of threes as a Detroit Piston — that might have been useful for the Lakers. 
Harrison Barnes
Wings are a common theme amongst these potential signings. Why? Well, because the Lakers currently have zero above replacement level wings on the roster, and they are 0-4. Coincidence? I think not. Harrison Barnes does not hit threes at the same rate as Bogdanovic, but he’s a better defender and a very smart player. Do not forget that this guy was the starting small forward of the record-breaking 73-9 Golden State Warriors. 
On a positive note, this could be a fun offseason for the Lakers, with money to play with and just four rostered players. Unfortunately, this ends my short stint as the Lakers general manager. To any NBA front office members reading, I’m just a phone call away — don’t be afraid to reach out with any job offers.

Joshua Tree National Park may not seem like an ideal place for undergraduate architecture students to design and install a building, but to Douglas Noble, an associate professor of architecture at the USC School of Architecture, the difficult environment of Joshua Tree poses the perfect challenge for some of the design projects of fourth-year architecture students.  
“Joshua Tree is a unique location for architecture students to study because the climate is very difficult,” Noble said. “So when we ask fourth-year undergraduate architecture students to design a building for Joshua Tree, they’re faced with enormous challenges … where would they put the building? There’s no electricity, there’s no water. There’s no help of any kind.”
Now, as the result of years of tireless work and effort, USC architecture students have installed a shade structure called the Carapace Pavilion in the park — with the team receiving multiple industry awards for their work. 
“Before they graduated, our students had an award hanging on the wall that many professional architects never get. So, all the students who worked on that original design team have an AIA design award on their wall, and that’s not a student award …  at the event we were given our award for this little tiny project, and the next award-winning project was SoFi stadium,” Noble said.
The partnership between the USC School of Architecture and Joshua Tree began a decade ago. Noble, passionate about national parks and motivated to do some sort of project with his students involving one, came into contact with the superintendent of Joshua Tree National Park, Mark Butler, who happened to be a USC alumnus. 
“He was pretty enthusiastic about working with us and making the Trojan connection, and that’s how we got started,”  Noble said.
Students worked with Noble and other faculty for several years on projects for the national park until 2019, when the project that would later become the Carapace Pavilion began.
Michael Gonzales, a USC alumnus, became involved in the Carapace Pavilion when he was a senior in 2019. He said that the initial design for the structure came about through the collaborative efforts of the students who had enrolled in Noble’s topic studio class. 
“Professor Noble made a criteria for us, which had certain parameters based on actual rules from the National Park,” Gonzales said. “So collectively, we would make a design, and then, based on the checklists and parameters that we were designing within, we would see whose design hit all those markers. So some obviously hit it better than others or some couldn’t hit those parameters, but we used a lot of those rules to help guide our design.”
Ivan Wong, a 1st year master’s student studying science in product innovation who also became involved in the 2019 project, discussed the collaborative environment, with students participating in every stage and aspect of the project. 
“When the studio started, everyone kind of did everything in terms of design and talking through how we’re going to build this thing … I feel like everyone in that studio did so much,” Wong said.
Among several technical challenges, the biggest obstacle the Carapace Pavilion team faced was the coronavirus pandemic; Victoria Dam, a USC alumna, discussed how the pandemic stunted  the project.
“When we were starting to get into a good momentum, the pandemic happened, and because of the University rules, we were [considered] students, and students were not allowed to work on the project,” she said.  “So that delayed our schedule quite a bit.”
Although students were not allowed to work on the project during the pandemic, Noble maintained some progress by working with alumni and faculty. Eventually the team completed and installed Carapace Pavillion in Joshua Tree in October of this year — holding a special significance to the students who spent the last three years working for the project to become a reality.
“It feels like the work was worth it, just seeing it installed. I think the awards were really cool and surprising, too,” Wong said.

Hours before the USC vs. Washington State football game kicked off, tailgaters in McCarthy Quad could look around the many cardinal and gold tents to find the Waste-Ed Wagon nearby, helping them recycle. 
USC’s Zero Waste Auditors, Nick Belgrave and Josh Rebello, are out with the Waste-Ed Wagon, a mobile recycling station, before every home football game, with the goal of helping limit the waste produced by tailgaters and educating others on how to recycle.
“We’ve realized if we put more of these [blue recycling boxes] out, we can capture even more recycling,” Rebello said. “So, we drive the cart around and collect recycling.”
Before every home football game, the Waste-Ed Wagon filled with recycling bins is pulled around McCarthy Quad by a golf cart in the midst of the chaos of tailgating, sporting a banner reading “Mobile Recycling Station.” There, Belgrave and Rebello help nearby tailgaters recycle with ease in a way that allows for both enjoyment and a healthy environment. 
Initially, the team focused their energies on including a “Waste Endzone” area at the game in which attendees could sort through their waste. Soon, however, the idea came about to make sustainable waste disposal more accessible for everyone. 
“We realized maybe it was harder for them to, in the middle of the tailgate, bring stuff over,” Belgrave said. 
Upon this realization, the Zero Waste team started out by bringing recycling bags to tailgates and eventually evolving into the Waste-Ed wagon which is seen today. 
The Zero Waste team is dedicated to sustainability outside of game days as well. All around campus, students can see waste sorting stations whenever they leave their classrooms, allowing them to recycle or compost their waste. The team wanted to purposefully plant these stations all throughout campus, wherever students are nearby. One of the team’s biggest goals is to help students familiarize themselves with sustainable living on campus in a way that makes it a natural part of their day. According to the team, they want to help those on campus experience and engage with sustainability in a positive way while they’re at USC. 
“As a freshman, you come in, you go to the orientation breakfast and lunch and you see the composting,” Rebello said. “You see compost and recycling at TCC or Leavey Library. You go to a tailgate and see that we recycle there. It’s the standard everywhere you go on campus.”
In familiarizing students from freshman year with recycling, the team hopes to make sustainable waste management accessible to all. The goal is that, when students graduate from the University, their time spent at USC has been environmentally beneficial. 
“We want to set an expectation, bring awareness to campus about what we’re doing and make it as easy as possible,” said Gina Whisenant, Waste and Recycling Manager at USC. 
The Waste-Ed wagon has had a lot of success in getting attendees involved, according to the team. 
“People love to take selfies with the cart,” Rebello said. “They think it’s fun. It’s a unique thing.”
Rebello and Belgrave are out whenever the wagon is talking to people and helping educate them on how to recycle, spreading the message all around the campus from their use of bullhorns at McCarthy Quad to their one-on-one interactions with attendees. 
At the end of the day, the team’s goal is to allow tailgaters to continue having a good time, while also helping control the environment of events. 
Some students, such as Melany Keroglyan, a junior majoring in Cinema and Media Studies, have been praising the efforts of the Waste-Ed Wagon on game days.
“I know that there’s a lot of people that bring their own drinks, lots of cans and other recyclable products,” Keroglyan said. “Having [the Waste-Ed Wagon] around probably helps provoke people into adopting that behavior in their homes.”
The Zero Waste team hopes to expand the reach of the Waste-Ed wagon beyond McCarthy Quad to Trousdale Parkway in order to reach more people. In expanding their reach, they aim to bring more awareness to recycling and help make the USC campus cleaner and waste-free during the excitement of game day.
The team hopes to not interfere with tailgating, but rather to make sustainable actions more accessible. 
“You can still have fun and be sustainable,” Whisenant said. “We’re just going to take all your recyclables off of your hands and try to control the environment in the [McCarthy] Quad area as much as we can.”

One, two, three, breathe. As I cut through the water, lactic acid pools in my quads. Wildfires ignite in my lungs. 
One, two, three, breathe. Tumbling from one wall to the other, I chase after a 500 free record, longing for the crisp bite of the water. I can feel my sweat mixing with the pool chlorine.
One, two, three, breathe. With a firm grip on the tiled lip, I gasp for air in greedy gulps. Pausing briefly to bask in the last lights of the moon, I paddle towards the steps before pulling myself up onto my feet.
If you’ve ever swam in the Uytengsu dive pool, you’ll soon realize that Michael Phelps is a fish. 25 yards long (almost Olympic length), the deep end of the pool spans 17 feet. Its “shallow” end measures just short of seven feet. Back home, I swam regularly — 600 free, 400 back and, if I was feeling particularly angsty, 300 fly. At Uytengsu, however, despite years of swimming, I feel like a fish out of water. Even when my arms threaten to disjoint, I keep moving. I focus on the next extension. Ignoring my screaming muscles, I don’t have the energy to think about how the pool’s depth is more than three times my height. Or that if my body shorted in any way, I could drown. No, I just keep swimming.
On campus, it’s almost as if I’m still in the water. While I understand that university is designed to provide both professional and recreational opportunities, rather than being offered towels and water bottles, it often feels like students are pushed to produce quicker turnarounds and break PRs. Our coaches’ love language? Internship fairs, career open houses, professional newsletters, information sessions, competitive clubs, honor societies and resume workshops. 
While there is the occasional mention of “do something nice for yourself or something…,” words of encouragement are few and far between.
At USC, competitive clubs and career/school stereotypes perpetuate a “just keep swimming” culture. At times, my friends have said “getting into a pre-professional club at USC is harder than getting into the university itself!” Out of courtesy, we all laugh — in pain. They’re not wrong — some consulting clubs, for example, accept as low as six percent of applicants. Logically, smaller teams make sense — they encourage efficiency and member specialization, allowing them to service clients like Google and TikTok as a toolbox of diverse, effective and innovative solutions. However, such low statistics allow for this hyper-competitive mindset to seep from club processes to the individual. 
Soon, instead of swimming in pursuit of the infinite game — to challenge yourself, push your limits, and grow — you’ve become a mule to the finite. You can’t go the distance. With your consistent kicks and breathing pattern, you’ve trained yourself to go the 50, go the 100, go the 200. You’re swimming to reach the other wall, to hear the whistle, to towel off and leave practice. You’re not pulling yourself forward with every stroke; you’re at war with the water, trying to sprint and claw your way to the finish line. But in life, there is no finish line. Only checkpoints. 
Piling on clubs, internships, challenging coursework and more, many students, fatigued, “just keep swimming.” Despite worn muscles, they fear if they don’t, their bodies will collapse and they will, if not immediately, eventually drown.
On any given morning, my inbox greets me groggily with a bundle of newsletters, club-related emails and a few Handshake notifications. I’ll admit, it’s a tad overwhelming. As a freshman studying Philosophy, Politics & Economics with Honors, I’m involved in organizations like the Trojans Scholar Society, the Consulting Club and the Ski Team. But, in order to “just keep swimming,” I need to come up for air and just float. Whether that be reveling in the chaos of the Lyon Center or strolling down the aisles of Trader Joe’s, I don’t work until my muscles give out — I utilize the pull buoys, foam boards and breaks around me. 
I understand that leadership and strength don’t come from being the fastest or most impressive candidate – these traits are curated over time, persistently and continuously, from challenges and experiences. So when I feel tired, I rest and come up for air, because I’m not a fish like Phelps or Dory — I’m human. So if any of this resonated with you, stop swimming for a bit, you’ll be okay. 
One, two, three, breathe.

At the intersection of lucid dreaming and artificial intelligence stands Olivia Peace. 
Peace received the 2022 Student Academy Award in the Alternative/Experimental category for their film “Against Reality,” at a ceremony held last week at the Academy Museum, following September’s winner announcement. 
“Against Reality” is an innovative film that used artificial intelligence to generate imagery representative of Peace’s experience with lucid dreaming. Peace’s work is often put under the category of “new media” which Peace describes as “a funny word for just like rigamarole — things that aren’t quite a film but aren’t quite a video game, things that kind of exist in this in between space.” 
“Against Reality” began early on in the pandemic, when — for the first time since childhood — they began having vivid “prophetic” dreams. After they noticed both their friends and people on Twitter having similar experiences, they set off to make a short documentary about “dreams in the wake of this pandemic” with two friends.
“This was going to be our pandemic project,” Peace said. “While other people were baking bread or learning how to skate, that was our thing.”
Peace and their friends began to interview scientists specializing in dreams and neurology about their vivid dreams, and Peace said that what they learned through those interviews completely  “opened [their] mind.” 
While the project began as a science-oriented documentary, they said that as artists it quickly shifted to a focus on the spiritual practice of dreaming. Peace and their friends began writing down their dreams nightly in what they called a “dream circle,” which led Peace to eventually learn how to lucid dream. 
For Peace, dreams began to seem like “the key to everything,” with dreams influencing their life and creative endeavors. 
“I had this idea that dreams are just kind of this random thing that happens at night, that’s just silly and not really worth looking into too much,” Peace said. “But I found that the more that you allow them to be meaningful to you, and the more you take your time to listen to them or try to process and understand them, the more that they can actually be helpful in your waking life, if that’s what you want.” 
Peace’s friends eventually told them that the film “should be a story in [their] own voice,” which led Peace to make the film “Against Reality” as their thesis project for their master’s degree in Interactive Media and Games. 
“When students want to do a film, it’s a reasonable question to say ‘are they in the right program?’” said Peter Brinson, a professor of interactive media and games at the School of Cinematic Arts and one of Peace’s thesis advisors. “Of course, Olivia was, because it’s the new frontier to combine interactive media with the tradition of filmmaking… to give software prompts and that generates imagery based on what you tell it is something we’ll just increasingly see people experiment with.” 
While Peace is trailblazing a path for a new era of filmmaking, they never considered cinema as a creative option until they arrived at Northwestern University and discovered there was no illustration program. Feeling lost, a mentor at the university directed Peace toward Northwestern’s film program, and although they fell in love with being on set, Peace still did not see directing as their calling until their senior year project, “Pangaea,” which they said became “a bit of a legend in the school” after their graduation, securing them a spot as a Sundance Ignite Fellow and the directorial position for 2020 feature film “Tahara.” 
It was once they began an internship at the Emblematic Group in Santa Monica, a studio focused on using virtual and augmented reality to create films, that Peace was fully able to explore digital media.
Still, Peace only began exploring artificial intelligence for art after seeing it on TikTok.
“It’s almost a new philosophy you have to adapt to work with it,’” Peace said. “With the AI, you are literally typing into it what you want and kind of just hoping for the best and having to surrender to whatever, whatever that might be. Sometimes it’s weird, sometimes it’s scary. I found sometimes it can even be profoundly racist or sexist because it’s pulling from the internet.” 
Brinson described Peace’s work as “the future of everything.” He notes that the technology Peace uses is evolving rapidly. 
“It’s becoming a new kind of skill, and it requires a different kind of AI to generate and recognize beauty or interest,” Brinson said. “It’s not surprising in retrospect, that Olivia is the one pulling that off.” 
“I’m excited to see someone who has such a strong perspective and voice leverage new technology in a way that it’s so impactful and meaningful and accomplishes their vision,” said Kevin Tsukii, who worked with Peace at Emblematic and served as one of their thesis advisors. “It’s not a shtick that they’re employing, but really something that executes their narrative.”
Peace recommends that all people begin writing down and recognizing their dreams, citing the Threat Simulation Theory. 
“The [Threat Simulation Theory] hypothesis is that dreams can be this third space where people can practice things that in their waking life are really difficult for them. Let’s say you have a hard conversation coming up or if a big presentation you’re nervous about, you might be able to practice that in your dream,” Peace said. “In your dreams, you find often you have what you need, despite it being scary.” 
Dreaming reminds Peace of Mary Oliver’s poem “Wild Geese” where Oliver describes that “you don’t need to be trying to struggle or be so disciplined or diligent.”
“In the dream realm, it’s so easy to do that because there’s no time. There’s no real spatial reasoning in the dream realm. Anything you want, you can actually just have right then and there, and you feel very much, especially when you’re lucid,” Peace said. “If I want to all of a sudden have a Ferrari, there it is, if I want to party with Snoop Dogg, there it is.” 
“Against Reality” is the first entry in a trilogy, with parts two and three to be released next year. This first film focuses on Peace’s experience dreaming with “a little hint of religious trauma.” They plan on making part two about the dream recipe they use to lucid dream and part three to be about the pitfalls of lucid dreaming. 
While Peace does recommend lucid dreaming, they cautioned others to understand the balance between the dream realm and reality.
“Sometimes when you have been really far on one end of the spectrum, when you learn another way of being, you might snap to the opposite end of that same spectrum,” Peace said. “I would spend my waking life wanting to go back to sleep and wanting to get back in my dreams… almost starting to undermine a little bit the importance of this reality for what was happening in the dream realm, because it was easier. It was more fun, it seemed like I had control over it. But the truth of matter is, they’re both important. They both feed each other.”
However, Peace clarified that another pitfall was that they thought they “had control over the dream realm in the first place.”
With the success of “Against Reality,” Peace has learned to be “right sized,” no longer relying on self depreciation and instead “taking up all the space meant for you.”
“This is one of the first things I’ve made where, instead of people asking me about how I made the film or the sound, people come up and start talking about themselves and talking about their dreams and their nightmares and their religious experiences,” Peace said. “The truth is, I have no idea what people need to see or what they need to experience. All I can do is, live my life, document it in some way and then put it out. That’s it. That’s my responsibility.”

Happy(ish) midterms season! I, like most students at the moment, seem to be drowning in work. First came the midterm that you thought was way too early, really just a fun name for an exam, and now suddenly you’re in the throes of it — it’s four AM and you’re still under Leavey’s fluorescent lights.
With everything going on in our lives, it is arduous to stay organized. I am what some would call scatterbrained. I’m constantly stressed, a chronic procrastinator who always feels like I am forgetting to do something. I put these labels on myself in high school and just accepted them as my reality. Organization wasn’t my thing and I thought it never would be. 
That all changed when I bought a five dollar pastel notebook from Target and designated it for to-do lists. Planners never really worked for me; I always gave up by the time October came around. But this was different. This was something I could organize however I wanted to. I could use glitter gel pens or the occasional free sticker from a club tabling around campus and make it insanely detailed. I always felt limited by the space that I was provided in a planner, only five or so lines for an entire day’s tasks, but here I had a whole page of lines to fill and I could spill over to the next with no consequence. 
Nothing quite compares to the satisfaction of getting to check off a task that you’ve done. Whether it be something that was stressing you out or something super small, all of its associated pressure dissipates with a simple check mark. Also, actually putting what you have to do on paper adds an extra layer of pressure. You can’t get away with not doing it or putting it off without having to stare at the empty box and then add it onto the next day’s list. 
A study done at Florida State University in 2011 found that just by writing down the tasks, you are more productive in your work. This isn’t just some cute journal to add to your already full backpack, it is truly an effective way to stay organized and be more productive (it just also happens to be aesthetic). There are endless benefits but according to psychologist and author in an interview with The Guardian, Dr. David Cohen says that his daily to-do lists “dampen anxiety,” give him structure and a strict plan and they provide “proof of what [he] has achieved.” I can personally second all of those statements.
What works best for me is a color system. Every class is a different color (Spanish obviously red, and of course economics is orange), and I even use pink for personal goals and blue for club meetings/tasks. The secret is to divide everything up into the smallest task possible, so then everything you do still feels productive because you’re checking off the box even if you didn’t make that much of a dent in the whole assignment. For example, I separate my longer writing assignments into smaller more manageable sections that start with a rough outline and end with a final draft later in the week. Instead of writing a paper for a week and not knowing what to do each day, I have a designated task assigned to each day. Even if it’s something as minuscule as starting a brainstorm list, now you have clear goals to break up a seemingly hazy task. In a 2020 article discussing the use of checklists, CNN Health writer Lauren Kent puts it best: The trick is to think of the checklist as “a set of miniature goals,” that are more like “steps in a plan” rather than a broad overarching list of mundane tasks.
I get the most satisfaction out of the pink section, my personal goals. This is because there is no limit to what I can write down. It ranges from what time to wake up, to showering, or sometimes even “touch grass” (‘cause that’s necessary these days). 
Setting up my list for the next day is part of my nightly routine. I sit at my desk, get out every colored pen I own and start the list. It’s almost a part of my self-care routine but with glittery pens and stickers. From the everyday tasks like waking up and getting ready to my classes and assignments, each is noted down and organized so that during the week all I have to do is check off a few things from the list that feel manageable to me each day. 
I know starting new habits like this may seem difficult, but I really urge you to try it out. I used to be the person that forgot assignments or didn’t study for my midterm until the night before, but my cheap little journal from Target has truly been a saving grace. Next time you’re there, just walk down the aisle and look at the notebooks. See if one stands out, and if it does, trust me — it’s worth the money. But, if it ends up not being the method for you, at least you have a cute journal to doodle or take notes in.

In an announcement Wednesday, the University of South Carolina proved that it is far from finished competing with the University of Southern California for the “USC” acronym.
According to a press release, the Carolina college will retire its “UofSC” logo mark used since 2019 and “simplify its branding marks” in the latest installment of the two schools’ feud over brand rights. Beginning Jan. 4, 2023, California’s USC will officially share the “USC” abbreviation with Carolina.
The announcement followed concern from Carolina’s students, fans and alumni over the “UofSC” acronym. Carolina Board Chairman Thad Westbrook wrote in a press release that the school’s Board of Trustees “strongly supports” the decision.
“We have no concerns about the use of ‘USC’ for our university,” Carolina wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Our fans, students and alumni still know us as USC, so we don’t anticipate any confusion. In fact, the announcement yesterday was met with near universal approval.”
The two universities’ dispute over trademark rights began in 2002 when Carolina attempted to federally register a trademark for a logo depicting the interlocking letters “SC,” a design used by both schools. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board sided with Southern California, arguing that the West Coast school already had a nearly identical registered trademark. 
Carolina filed an unsuccessful appeal soon after and filed another — yet again, unsuccessfully — in 2009, willing the U.S. Court of Appeals to cancel Southern California’s registration. The Supreme Court declined to hear yet another appeal by Carolina on the matter in 2010. 
While Carolina’s rebranding does not include another attempt to incorporate the contested interlocking letters, it introduces a new block-letter spirit mark branded with the school’s year of founding, 1801. One of Southern California’s eight athletic spirit marks also features the iconic three-letter sequence in block letters. 
Carolina’s “USC” acronym will not be present on athletics logos and the school will retain its gates-and-trees logo in official academic branding. Signs will be replaced and other updates made in the lead-up to the official brand change next year. 
Baladitya Swaika, a graduate student studying computer science, said Carolina’s rebranding may prove confusing digitally. Swaika said that since both colleges will appear when searching for school-specific sites and resources online, international students and prospective students, especially, may be misled. 
“Maybe during researching, they look up USC and they may want to come to Southern California, but they reach the South Carolina page, and they don’t know what to do,” Swaika said.
Swaika said he’s been trying to understand the reasoning behind the change and has considered that the previous branding, “UofSC,” possibly impeded students from connecting with the university.  
“That could very well be a legit reason for you to change [the acronym] — which I get — but I think that there are grave repercussions to this,” Swaika said.
A Carolina alumna, who prefers to be identified by her Twitter handle @SassyCappy5, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that she’s always thought of her alma mater as “USC” and wasn’t aware of the college’s 2019 renaming to “UofSC.” 
She said she doesn’t anticipate any confusion about the shared acronym because the schools’ official colors are different — Carolina’s colors are garnet and black, while Southern California’s are cardinal and gold — and the schools are geographically distant.
“I’m glad we went back to our roots and decided to go USC,” she said. “That’s what we know ourselves as.”

After taking a week off to recover from their first loss of the season and a slew of injuries, the Trojans will return to the gridiron Saturday against the Arizona Wildcats in Tucson.
Depth at the linebacker position is an immediate concern that will need to be addressed by kickoff. The loss against Utah saw sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry go down with an apparent lower leg injury. His counterpart, senior linebacker Shane Lee, also suffered a wrist injury in the Trojan’s win against Washington State.
The linebacker room not being at 100% health was felt as senior tight end Dalton Kincaid exploded for 234 receiving yards off of 16 catches against Utah.
Gentry is listed as day-to-day, and the Trojans could be thin at the linebacker position come Saturday.
“Guys have been able to take a lot of reps in [practice],” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley. “If everybody’s there, we’ll play with those guys. If not, the next guy’s up, kind of like we’ve done all year.”
One player who could make an impact at the linebacker position is redshirt junior Tuasivi Nomura, who Riley revealed broke his finger during the game against Fresno State, staying in for three more plays before exiting. 
“He’s about as tough as they come. [Nomura] broke his finger during the middle of a play… like bone sticking out, didn’t tell anybody,” Riley said. “So that tells you about his toughness and how much he wants to do well for this team.” 
Junior wide receiver Jordan Addison also exited the Utah game after an awkward landing that led to an apparent knee injury. The 2021 Biletnikoff award winner was seen using crutches after the game.
As with Gentry, Riley said that Addison is considered day-to-day and is confident in the depth at the receiver position. The returns of redshirt senior Terrell Bynum, sophomore Michael Jackson III and redshirt junior Kyle Ford have led to a deeper wide receiver room for the Trojans.
Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams said that the team has gained confidence over the last two weeks despite the loss to Utah.
“Right after the game there was a certain energy about the team when we were in the locker room,” Williams said. “There was a certain confidence… that was in the locker room after even though we lost.”
The Oklahoma transfer also said that the bye week came at the right time.
“Especially after a loss I think [the bye week] was really effective,” Williams said. “We give a couple guys some time to rest, we had a few injuries in the Utah game and then we get to just work on being consistent in the middle of the season.” 
With a 3-4 record, the Wildcats have already improved from last season, when they won just one game. Arizona, also coming off of a bye week, has just one win in the Pac-12 thus far — a 43-20 victory over a now 1-6 Colorado team that fired their head coach following the loss.
Defense has been a major issue for the Wildcats so far this season. Power 5 opponents (Mississippi State, Cal, Oregon, Colorado and Washington) are averaging 41.2 points against a defense that features a weak secondary that has allowed 246.71 passing yards per game. 
On the offensive side of the ball, the Wildcats have found more success. Sophomore quarterback Jayden de Laura is off to a strong start with 2,274 passing yards and 19 passing touchdowns. 
“The quarterback really makes it all go. He’s dynamic,” Riley said. “I enjoyed watching him at Washington State, watching him kind of fly around, make plays. He makes a lot of on schedule plays but [de Laura] is obviously very dangerous off schedule.”
Arizona fields what is among the best group of wide receivers the Trojans have faced all season. 
“You’ve got height, you’ve got speed and each individual guy kind of has their number one calling card,” said Defensive Coordinator Alex Grinch. “They can win jump balls, they can run by you… And they’ve been as productive as anybody in the country.”
Jacob Cowing, Dorian Singer and Tetairoa McMillan have accounted for a combined 1,812 yards and 15 touchdowns. 
Lincoln is familiar with McMillan, having recruited the freshman receiver during his time at Oklahoma. 
“He’s a good player. He’s got really nice skills for his size. He’s a guy that impressed us early on in our time,” Riley said. “They’re obviously doing a good job featuring him and getting him the ball… he’s a good playmaker and a tough matchup on the outside.”
The Trojans will face off against Arizona Saturday at 3:00 p.m. PST.

The NBA season kicked off Tuesday, Oct. 18 with matchups between four of the most recognizable brands in basketball. The Philadelphia 76ers traveled to the Eastern Conference champion, Boston Celtics, where the Celtics won by a score of 126-117. The Los Angeles Lakers played in San Francisco against the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors did not show any signs of a hangover, easing to a 123-109 victory. The only Trojan to play on opening night was fifth year guard De’Anthony Melton of the 76ers. Here’s a look at other former Trojans looking to make an impact on their respective teams. 
Big Man Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
Second year Evan Mobley is coming off a tremendous rookie season where he averaged 15 points per game, 8.3 rebounds per game, and 1.7 blocks per game. His performance earned him a spot on the NBA all-rookie first team and second place in the rookie of the year race. Mobley’s Cleveland Cavaliers are off to an impressive 2-1 start, led by newly acquired Donovan Mitchell. Mobley has also contributed to their success averaging 13.3 points per game and 5.3 rebounds per game. 
The former second team All-American at USC is also looking to stay healthy during his sophomore campaign, as he dealt with ankle injuries throughout his first season in the NBA. Mobley has added some muscle and gained perimeter offense, so he can develop into one of the best 3-and-D players in the NBA. 
Guard/forward DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
DeMar DeRozan is looking to add onto his impressive performance last year. The veteran averaged career highs in points at 27.9 points per game and 3-point shooting percentage at 35.2%. In his 14th year in the NBA, the former Trojan earned one fifth place vote in the MVP race, the same number of votes as legends like Kevin Durant and LeBron James. 
The 33 year old has led the Bulls to a 3-2 start to the season, where he is leading the team in points, with 27.3 points per game, and assists, 5.3 assists per game. DeRozan is looking to lead the Bulls to another playoff appearance along with fellow Trojan Nikola Vucevic. Last year, the Bulls went home disappointed as they were a first round exit, losing to the Milwaukee Bucks. 
Forward/center Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
Third year big man Onyeka Okongwu is looking to gain more rotational minutes compared to his first two seasons in the NBA. Okongwu has only played in 50 and 48 games respectively in his first two seasons, out of a full 82 game schedule. But when he is on the court he has presented his strengths, averaging 8.2 points per game and 5.9 rebounds per game last season. 
Okongwu looks to be a strong sixth man in the Hawks rotation, with the highest average minutes per game off of the bench. The quicker Okongwu is an effective complement big man to slower veteran Clint Capela. 
The former star alongside the Ball brothers at Chino Hills High School will look to put his name in the starting lineup for the Hawks if he keeps playing efficiently and most importantly stays healthy. 
Guard/forward Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets
The first round pick out of USC in 2019 had a scorching start this NBA season. Porter Jr. is averaging 20.8 points per game while shooting 47.6% from behind the arc through the Rockets first four games of the season. He significantly improved his 3 point-shooting percentage from 31% to 37.5% a season ago. The former Trojan is also leading the Rockets in assists and steals per game so far this season. 
Porter Jr. is a key piece in the young Houston Rockets team alongside fellow first round picks Jalen Green and Jabari Smith Jr. In order to have a successful season, the Rockets need the high energy Porter Jr. to showcase his skills every night. 
The Houston Rockets and Porter Jr. agreed to a 4 year, $82.5 million contract extension this past week.
