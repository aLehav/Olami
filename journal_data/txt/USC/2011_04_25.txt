Students were unable to connect to the USC wireless network as early as 8 a.m. until approximately 5 p.m. Monday because of technical issues during an upgrade.
Kevin Durkin, ITS director of communications and marketing, said the upgrade was made in response to an expected increase of USC wireless during the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books this weekend.
“We were increasing the capacity of the USC wireless network in anticipation of the additional number of people we expect this weekend for the L.A. Times Festival of Books,” Durkin said. “During the upgrade, we encountered technical issues which have been resolved [as of 5:00 p.m.]. The wireless network is back up, but slow. We anticipate the technical issues to be fully resolved after the hour.”
By 6 p.m., most areas around campus returned to full wireless support.
The “USC wireless plus” network, which was rolled out in the last year, work throughout the day. Durkin said students should use the wireless plus network because the network is encrypted, making it safer to use.
“We encourage all USC account holders to use wireless plus because it’s an encrypted network,” Durkin said.
Students can find out how to use the wireless plus network by going to the USC ITS website here. Generally, Mac users (Snow Leopard or higher) and iPad users can use their Wi-Fi and log into the system with their student username and password. Those running Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows XP must download a connection plug-in from software.usc.edu and then adjust their wireless settings.
“Only USC account holders can use wireless plus,” Durkin said. “It’s faster, it’s encrypted and it’s available only to USC account holders.”
Nethika Ariyasinghe, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, said that she was unable to access one of her online course books to do schoolwork because of the connectivity issues.
“I tried checking my email and it didn’t work, then I couldn’t open my book,” Ariyasinghe said. “I restarted and restarted my computer like a million times, and finally the internet came on after quite some time.”
“The ‘USC wireless plus’ network, which was rolled out in the last year, work throughout the day. ”
That’s not even English.

Gateway Apartments management on Monday night painted over a six-inch swastika that was found in a stairway near the sixth floor over the weekend.
Although it is not being reported as a hate crime because there were no victims involved, the Office of Religious Life, USC Hillel, the Dept. of Public Safety and Gateway management are working together to determine who is behind the drawing, according to officials involved.
“Without further evidence to indicate this was a hate crime, it is a minor vandalism with no evidence to follow up on,” said DPS Capt. David Carlisle. “We instructed Gateway to notify us if any further incidents of this nature occurs.”
Soni said the university is trying to find out what happened and is supporting students who were affected by it.
“Obviously it’s a very hateful and cowardly act, and I regret that our students were subjected to it. We take it extremely seriously,” said Varun Soni, dean of religious life. “It’s something that’s an isolated incident — it’s not [representative] of the Jewish life on our campus.”
When the Gateway maintenance team heard about it, they removed the gel layer, but the outline of the Swastika was still visible Monday evening.
Tyler Treadway, Gateway’s building manager, said a work order for the vandalism was put in Saturday afternoon.
Treadway said Monday that Gateway management had decided to paint over the outline because it could not remove it by other means.
Some Jewish students living in Gateway said they are not happy with what happened or with Gateway’s response.
“If someone wrote the F-word on a wall, they would paint over it immediately. I don’t understand why it took them two days to do something about this,” said Bess Benhamou, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “I, as most Jewish people would, feel personally assaulted by their lack of courtesy to erase such a symbol immediately.”
Treadway said  Gateway and DPS are making sure everyone is working together to see if there are any more leads. According to Carlisle, no further information has been found.
Michael Jeser, executive director at USC Hillel, said he is thinking about putting together a program before school ends to allow open discussion about messages like this.
“We want to raise awareness about this, but we also want to do this through students and encourage them to take a position,” Jeser said.
Soni said vandalism has occurred only two or three times in the three years he’s been at USC, according to Soni. He said in all of these cases, the perpetrator has not been found.
“People who commit these types of hateful and cowardly acts are rarely caught,” Soni said. “They do it anonymously in the cover of night, quickly.”
Although some students are upset by Gateway’s lack of immediate action, Treadway said Gateway is following protocol.
“It’s just unfortunate that we have those kinds of people, but I’m happy with our response to it. It’s being taken care of through USC, through DPS,” Treadway said.
Soni said incidents like these are an opportunity for people to join together.
“Even if it happens once, that’s too many times. Our opportunity at a research university is to come together,” Soni said. “We are defined as how we come together, and we do really well as a university [in] supporting our Jewish students and combating religious prejudice and anti-Semitism.”
Wow – graffiti in LA – is this really news? I heard recently Antisemitic tagging occurred in a Calabasas high school this week as well. The story was in LA Times. I wonder why when other acts of vandalism and graffiti occurs, it never makes the news but when it has Antisemitic undertones then it makes headlines. Could the media be biased?
It’s a remnant from the movie “Higher Learning.” You guys know that was filmed on SC’s campus right?..the director, John Singleton is an alumnus.
I hope it’s not like that jewish girl who did it herself and cried about it..

Going green is becoming increasingly popular but some on-campus organizations have found it difficult to garner student and administrative support. To counter these problems, many groups have begun banding together.
Planet · Members of USC’s CALPIRG tabled on Trousdale last year for Earth Week. The organization has had funding issues this semester. - Daily Trojan file photo 
One significant problem for these groups is money.
Organizations receive some funding from the Undergraduate Student Government, but finding funds remains a major issue.
CALPIRG, which held a pledge drive earlier this semester where students signed up to donate $10 a month to help keep USC’s chapter of CALPIRG open is among the groups facing funding challenges.
“CALPIRG is a student-funded organization and our chapter is suffering because we are separate from the administration, unlike other chapters,” said Koushaw Ghaffarian, a sophomore majoring in economics/math and political science and working on CALPIRG’s global solutions campaign.
CALPIRG is recognized in the University of California system, which directly bills student’s tuition accounts, while at USC there is a bylaw preventing that. As a result USC’s CALPIRG chapter has to ask for students to pledge via their credit cards.
To get more funding for sustainability initiatives, the Sustainability Leadership Committee, a group that acts as a forum for communication and collaboration between student organizations, is working to draft a proposal the “Green Fund,” which would create an easy funding route for green organizations.
The Sustainability Leadership Committee meets monthly with the various sustainability groups on campus to discuss how to share common resources.
“At the beginning of the year, there were only about five groups out of around 15 represented during meetings,” said Rosie Murphy, a freshman majoring in history and print journalism and a member of the Sustainability Leadership Committee. “Now there are almost 10, so a lot of groups are pulling resources and campaigns are stronger and more cohesive,”
“We are currently working on different proposals and coming up with solutions that would be appealing to the entire university as a whole,” said Kareem Khulusi, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering and president of Students for Environmental Enterprise, a group that aims to educate students about careers in the sustainability field.
Some student organizations have faced difficulties while trying to promote sustainability to students and the university.
Keck Students for Sustainability, a new organization that operates on the Health Sciences Campus and aims to raise awareness about how environmental pollution affects human health, is working with facilities and management services to make the campus greener.
“We are working to bring recycling to study rooms for medical students this year and hope to expand to other graduate programs on campus in the future,” said Bhupi Chima, a second-year medical student and group leader.
Chima hopes that as the group becomes more established on campus, more people will support its endeavors and change will be made.
Sustainable groups also face difficulty in collaborating with USC administration. Having the support of the administration with sustainability efforts is important, according to sustainability organizations, because it increases the likelihood of being successful with green initiatives.
Several groups, such as USC Beyond Coal and Students for Environmental Enterprise, said would like the administration to be more open to changing and listening about sustainability issues.
Collaboration with the administration has not been easy, according to Henrietta Levin, an intern with the organization.
“USC is stuck in the status quo and [President C. L. Max] Nikias needs to help the university go forward in energy,” Levin said. “Our reputation is suffering against schools like Stanford and Berkeley who are taking renewable energy initiatives.”
Khulusi believes the administration’s relationship with student groups should be closer.
“It should be a little more like an apprenticeship between us. The administration knows the system and they should teach us how we can make change and get our voices heard,” Khulusi said.

The latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll indicates an overall pessimistic outlook among the California electorate.
Less than 20 percent of voters surveyed believe California is headed in the right direction, and 70 percent of respondents said the state is moving in the wrong direction.
Political analysts Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Stanley Greenberg, chairman and CEO of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, and David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, a public opinion research firm held a conference call Monday to discuss the poll’s results.
Kanevsky attributes California voters’ negative attitudes to the economy.
“The economic downturn has broken Californians personally,” Kanevsky said. “There is not the optimism that bright days are around the corner.”
The most fundamental finding from the poll is California voters are in favor of a referendum to solve the state’s mounting budget crisis, which Gov. Jerry Brown campaigned for in his 2010 election, according to Schnur.
“The most important thing that came out of the poll is that Californians want to vote on a budget solution,” Schnur said. “The poll underscores that the Governor is correct in honoring the commitment [for a referendum] that he made in his campaign.”
The poll also found an overwhelming majority of Californians are in favor of a mixed solution to the state’s budget crisis.
The solution would entail an extension of tax increases signed into law in 2009 by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in addition to further cuts in government spending, according to the poll.
Californians also indicated they are prepared to make sacrifices to balance the budget and curb the state’s debt.
According to Schnur, having the backing of the electorate to make drastic cuts in government spending provides Brown the  support he needs to make the decisions necessary to resolve the state’s financial woes.
“While Californians don’t understand the specifics of the budget crisis, they do understand the severity of the crisis, and Californians are willing to make difficult decisions and have chartered a course forward for the governor as he attacks the budget crisis,” Schnur said.
Greenberg also noted the governor’s high approval ratings will play a pivotal role as debate over the state’s budget heightens.
“Governor Brown has a net positive approval rating and a favorable personal rating, which put him in a decent position to lead the state of California in this difficult time,” Greenberg said. “He has moved the state to where he is on the budget issues. They will hold him accountable and hold him to a referendum with reforms in spending and tax increases.”
Kanevsky is more cautious about Brown’s approval ratings, noting one in five voters are uncertain about his job approval, and that it is still early in his first term. Kanevsky also noted California voters are in favor of a referendum, but not necessarily tax increases.
“A strong majority approves holding a special election to extend tax increases,” Kavensky said. “That doesn’t mean voters will support [a tax increase], they prefer making the decision themselves.”
Though Brown polled well, Republicans in the state legislature saw a decrease in their approval rating.
The poll specifically oversamples the Latino population, allowing political analysts greater insight into the state’s fastest growing voter-group. The poll suggested Latinos considerably disapprove of cuts in spending.
Kristen Rodgers, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, is in favor of a mixed budget solution.
“Right now we all need to make sacrifices,” Rodgers said. “We need to raise taxes to temporarily fix the budget and institute spending cuts to ensure the state’s stability in the future.”
USC teamed up with the Los Angeles Times in 2009 to conduct political polls, and plans to continue to do so through the 2012 elections.

The No. 1 USC women’s golf team has been playing above par all season.
Last week, the team won the 2011 Pac-10 championship, its fourth in program history and first since 2008.
Not only did the Women of Troy take home the team title, but freshman Sophia Popov captured the Pac-10’s individual title.
The Daily Trojan sat down with Popov to hear her thoughts on the season so far.
Freshman sensation · Freshman Sophia Popov captured an individual Pac-10 championship, USC’s fourth ever in program history. - Photo courtesy of Sports Information 
 
Daily Trojan: How did it feel winning both the team and individual titles at the Pac-10 championships?
Sophia Popov: It was pretty exciting, mostly to win the team title because that was what we were really aiming for, and that was my main goal. We have been working really hard this season and we have won a couple of tournaments so we thought, ‘Let’s win that Pac-10 title.’ Winning it individually was great especially since it was my second one in a row.
 
DT: What would you say was the highlight of the Pac-10 championships?
Popov: For me personally it was the playoffs in the end. I had a really good last round and I played okay the last two holes. I made a bogey on 17 so I kind of got caught up on that hole a little. I had to go into the playoffs and tied with [UCLA’s] Tiffany Lua and that was just very exciting for me because it was a nice way to finish a tournament.
 
DT: How would you describe the course you and the rest of the team played on during the competition?
Popov: The course was rather open and kind of challenging because it was kind of windy. In Arizona, it’s kind of like a desert course but it was a nice course. It was pretty wide, really tough greens. It wasn’t the most difficult course, but it was definitely challenging because of the wind and the conditions we had.
 
DT: Despite losing junior Lisa McCloskey, ranked third in the country, on the final day of competition due to injury, USC still came out on top. In what ways did her absence affect the team, if at all?
Popov: I knew her back was bad because I was rooming with her and she was really not doing very well, so I had this feeling that she wasn’t going to be able to play because she was in a lot of pain. And so our coach just comes to us on the driving range before we teed off and said, ‘I think Lisa is not going to make it today.’ But I knew we still had four players and we can still score really low, so if we just hang in there, just play for Lisa, then that’s all we can really do. It was tough, but us four players showed we could shoot really low without her. So it was a loss definitely, but we could pull through pretty well.
 
DT: You are a freshman this year, but have already proven yourself as a valuable member of the team. How has your first year on the team been and what have you taken away from it?
Popov: It’s been pretty great. It was kind of funny — my first tournament didn’t go very well. I played pretty bad because it took a little time to get used to everything here and it’s different from Europe. But I got my game up pretty fast. I won at Stanford in the fall and now I won two back-to-back tournaments, so obviously it’s been really good and I’ve jumped up the rankings now, too. I’m kind of overwhelmed by my game right now, but I’m trying to just keep my focus for the next two tournaments and hopefully I keep the momentum going.
 
DT: What are your hopes for the upcoming NCAA regionals?
Popov: For me, it’s to win with the team again. Obviously I want to play well individually. My expectations are high, but I know myself — no player can just keep it up that well. I just want to get a top finish and try to be satisfied with my game there and hopefully win with the team, and for the NCAAs pretty much the same.

I’ve been coming to USC football games for as long as I can remember.
I’ve been to games as a giddy kid, a drunken student and a dispassionate journalist. I don’t have to tell you which setting was the most fun.
As I look back on the three years I covered the team and the 17 years I was a fan, it’s always the glory years that resonate most strongly. I remember when the program started to turn around in former coach Pete Carroll’s second year, when former quarterback Carson Palmer made his Heisman run, which paved the way for Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush to form a few of the greatest teams to ever don the cardinal and gold.
Those years come to mind because the state of the program today is so far from what it was then.
The Trojans won’t be in contention for the national title next season, regardless of the fact that NCAA sanctions probably won’t allow them to play for it, anyway. Based on the display put on at the Coliseum last week, USC is facing an uphill battle to simply stay relevant in the Pac-12. The program has been so hampered by NCAA penalties and coaching changes that it’s like a wounded animal, a sad shell of its former self.
But the reason I look back fondly on the glory days of Trojan football is not just because of the double-digit victories and strings of conference titles and national championships. Whatever Carroll titles his books, no team can win forever or even stay competitive forever. Ups and downs are part of sports.
What made those years special was the purity I perceived in it all. I was a kid who reveled in Saturdays at the Coliseum. I wore the No. 11 and No. 5 USC jerseys with pride in high school. I didn’t care about not having an NFL team. The way I saw it, college football at USC was superior anyway, because it was about honor, tradition and soul, while the NFL was all business.
Pretty naïve right?
While he was at USC, Bush was the most electrifying athlete I’ve ever seen in person. He regularly did things on the football field I’ve never seen anyone else do. His explosiveness, his vision, his leaping ability were exhilirating to watch. There was nothing like the anticipation that would build in the Coliseum on a fourth down when the opposing team was punting to Bush and the whole crowd was chanting, “REG-GIE, REG-GIE, REG-GIE!”
I first heard Bush had possibly done something wrong when I was a junior in high school. It’s absolutely insane to think that five years later, USC is not only still paying for his transgressions, but is still unsure about the full extent of the penalties. If the results of the appeal are not announced in the next two weeks, I will have completed four years of college before the coffin was finally closed on USC’s skeleton.
What Bush did didn’t make me like him less or respect his talents less. But it was the first time I started to doubt the purity of college football.
Turns out this sport is just as much about business as the NFL.
Looking at the scandals that have littered the college football landscape in the past year is enough to demonstrate the harsh realities of college sports. Not even 16-year-old me could have sat through the mercenary sale of Auburn quarterback Cam Newton or the shady lies of Ohio State coach Jim Tressel without recognizing the hypocrisy of it all.
As I moved through college and grew more jaded, I understood these issues from different perspectives. Players took money because they were getting screwed by schools and the NCAA, who were making millions off their image. Top juniors went to the NFL because the timing was right and they wanted to start cashing in on their earning power as soon as possible. Coaches left for greener pastures because they were promised fatter contracts and more control.
Although it was sometimes ugly, it was logical. Everyone is always looking for an edge. It was a hard lesson, not just about football. In life, this is the way things work. That’s why when I think about USC football, I like to go back to a time before I was cynical and when I was convinced I was watching something uncontaminated.
That famous touchdown run Bush had against Fresno State always sticks in my mind, the play where he exploded to the left sideline, stopped on a dime and cut back for a score. He basically won the Heisman on the play, the Heisman he would later give back before it was stripped from him. It led to a touchdown that didn’t count actually, in a win that was later vacated, during a season that is now tainted.
But if I don’t think about all the fallout that came later, I can appreciate it for what it was.
What a great run.

It is one of the most gut-wrenching and disappointing sights in baseball: watching the other team celebrate a walk-off victory.
Eight weeks ago, the USC baseball team watched Long Beach State celebrate a walk-off win on a frigid Tuesday night in Long Beach. Today, the Trojans (18-21) have a chance to return the favor as they host the Dirtbags (19-18) at 6 p.m.
Bounce back · With junior pitcher Ben Mount’s move to the closer role, freshman pitcher Kyle Richter will be called upon to make his third career start. Richter will look to get the Trojans back on track after they suffered an 8-2 defeat at Washington on Sunday. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“[Long Beach’s] game-winning single was hit to me,” said junior right fielder Alex Sherrod. “I had a chance to throw the guy out and I bobbled it. You try to release the mental brick, but personally, I’m still hanging on to that. You try to put your losses behind you, but I’m still thinking about it.”
When the Trojans last faced Long Beach, they scored two runs in the seventh to even the game at four and threatened to take the lead in the ninth. It was the Dirtbags, however, who came through with an RBI-single in the bottom of the ninth off junior closer Chad Smith to walk away with a 5-4 win.
Junior pitcher Ben Mount started that game and gave the Trojan’s five innings of one-run ball. But with Smith out for the season with an elbow injury, USC interim coach Frank Cruz is trusting Mount to fill the closer’s role.
The righty is third on the team with a 2.89 ERA and has allowed just one run in his last eight and one-third innings of work.
“Mount has a lot of confidence right now,” Cruz said. “He’s keeping the ball down well. Most importantly, he’s just throwing strikes.”
Mount’s move to closer means freshman Kyle Richter will make his third career start today.
The young lefty has electric stuff, as opponents are hitting just .216 against him. But he has struggled throwing strikes, issuing 13 free passes hitting two batters in 19 and two-third innings of work.
Against Loyola Marymount last Tuesday, however, Richter started the Trojans off with two perfect innings before being removed to save his arm for the weekend.
“That won’t happen this week,” Cruz said. “We’ve got an extra day’s rest, so we’ll let Richter go a little more.”
Last weekend, the Trojans played Washington in a Thursday through Saturday series instead of the traditional Friday through Sunday to avoid playing on Easter, meaning the team only had Wednesday off.
This weekend the Trojans are back to the classic scheduling, giving them the usual two days of rest.
USC took two of three from the Huskies this weekend to notch its third-consecutive Pac-10 series win, but dropped the final game of the series for just the second time this season in Pac-10 play.
Although the series victory is important, losing the final game leaves the team and Cruz with what the first-year coach calls a “sour taste.”
“It was a good series,” Sherrod said. “But obviously you want to complete the sweep when you have the chance.”
Although the Trojans cannot sweep the Dirtbags, they have a chance for something almost as special: revenge.
But Cruz, Sherrod and the rest of the team know that they can’t get too caught up in that.
“Obviously you want to get them back,” Cruz said. “But it’s not so much about exacting revenge as it is about us just getting back on the winning track.”
First pitch is at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

Summer’s starting early this year. In Hollywood, at least, summer begins with the release of the first big blockbuster hopeful. Thor, due May 6, will be followed by countless other “event” movies, big-budget action flicks and a record number of sequels.
The summer box office will no doubt be dominated by the likes of the eighth and final Harry Potter, the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean and a whole lot of superheroes, mutants, cowboys and aliens.
But this summer could still deliver a few hidden gems, as long as they don’t get overshadowed by the rehashed plots and epic stunts of the summer blockbusters.
Here are a few of the movies to look forward to.
The Tree of Life, May 27
This new film from writer/director Terrence Malick is by far the most mysterious of the summer. The trailer explains  almost nothing about the actual plot of the film, and the only word so far is it revolves around a boy (the adult version of whom is played by Sean Penn) coming of age, caught between his parents. His mother (Jessica Chastain) represents a path of grace and love, while his father (Brad Pitt) stands for survival, power and nature.
The trailer offers fantastical images of revolving planets in a womb-like sky, an underwater bedroom and arctic landscapes. And, as the visual effects supervisor confirmed to the New York Post, there will also be dinosaurs.
Malick has only made two films in the last 20 years: the critically acclaimed The Thin Red Line and The New World. But his films are often considered high-minded artistic masterpieces.
It definitely isn’t your typical summer blockbuster, but the utter mystery surrounding The Tree of Life makes it a must-see.
Super 8, June 10
Okay, so this is in fact one of the summer’s big blockbusters, but with J.J. Abrams at the helm, we can still hope it will be an original film, full of intrigue and well-developed characters, either of which would elevate it above most of its competition.
Written by Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg, Super 8 follows a group of kids who witness a train carrying mysterious cargo from Area 51 derail while they are filming a Super 8 video.
Abrams was inspired by his own childhood filmmaking endeavors and the monster films he grew up with.
Set in 1979, the movie is said to evoke the vibe of early Spielberg classics. With Abrams’ sense of pop culture nostalgia and the uncanny knack for character-driven sci-fi drama he honed in Lost, Super 8 could be the best popcorn flick of the summer.
Conan O’Brien Can’t Stop, June 24 
This documentary follows the late night talk show host on his cross-country comedy tour, which he embarked on after parting ways with NBC last year. Though most of us followed the drama, the film succinctly recaps O’Brien’s much-publicized falling-out with the network after he briefly replaced Jay Leno as host of The Tonight Show.
But mostly, the movie is a celebration of the comedian and a hilarious behind-the-scenes look at Conan’s “The Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television” tour.
The documentary, which premiered at the SXSW Film Festival last month, is earning rave reviews, and critics say O’Brien is even funnier offstage than he is on.
But anyone who saw his utterly sincere and moving farewell speech on The Tonight Show knows that Conan’s serious side is worth our time, too. His genuine anger toward NBC comes out in the documentary, but the compassion we feel for him in his time of crisis will only make us appreciate his resilient sense of humor even more.
Crazy, Stupid, Love, July 29
Ryan Gosling is one of the most talented and versatile actors of his generation. He’s played a romantic lead in mainstream and gritty indie movies, a drug addict and a delusional man-child, and he’s about to prove his comedy chops in Crazy, Stupid, Love.
We’ll have to see if he can hold his own against co-star and producer Steve Carell, in his first post-The Office role, but odds are Gosling will impress once again.
He plays the womanizing young mentor to Carell’s cuckolded and newly divorced dad, who is suddenly thrust into the dating world. These two talented actors, with support from Julianne Moore and Emma Stone, are sure to turn Crazy, Stupid, Love into much more than just your average romantic dramedy or buddy film.
 
These are just a few of the films that might stand out from the pack of sequels and superheroes moviegoers will be seeing this summer. Whether or not these are the ones on your list, try to give the smaller movies a chance.
If you look out for originality and heart, not just the loudest advertisements and biggest budgets, it could be a really good summer for movies.

Patience is truly a virtue when watching a Kelly Reichardt film unfold.
The emotions boil in the silences and action is conveyed from a distance, usually obscured in the corners of the frame. And often, the most significant dialogue occurs off-screen, with viewers straining to hear it.
Wild west · Meek’s Cutoff follows a group of families in 1850 on a journey across the Oregon desert while zeroing in on human nature. - Photo courtesy of Oscilooscope Laboratories  
Reichardt’s work, however, is much too cerebral to simply be labeled “slice of life,” even though mood and character tend to trump the story and plotline.
They are slices of lives viewed under a microscope, slices so miniscule that, for some, the film is probably comparable to watching grass grow.
Except there is no grass in Meek’s Cutoff, Reichardt’s latest drama about a group of families making the harrowing trek across the Oregon desert in 1850. The film is a careful examination of the human condition blown to its most extreme, weathered proportions.
Reichardt’s third film set in the Pacific Northwest, Meek’s Cutoff has her working with a much larger scenic scope.
Unlike 2008’s urban plight Wendy and Lucy, the road here goes through a barren desert devoid of water and, as the journey becomes increasingly aimless, hope.
As the three pioneering families are led off course by their over-confident guide, even the breathtaking backdrop of mountains and vast blue skies can’t disguise that this lost journey holds very little promise for the families.
Quite uncommon for Hollywood and Indiewood alike, there are no star turns here, save for the captivating stares of Michelle Williams.
As the fearless matriarch Emily Tetherow, Williams anchors the strong and unwavering ensemble cast that includes Will Patton, Paul Dano and Neal Huff as the husbands, and Shirley Henderson and Zoe Kazan as the wives.
A supremely bearded Bruce Greenwood plays guide Stephen Meek, a dangerous enigma to both the characters and spectators.
The film might be titled Meek’s Cutoff, but this is Emily’s story, and the story of the women who willingly followed their men on the trail until they, too, reached their own cutoff point.
The film takes on a uniquely feminist viewpoint, perhaps inadvertently, considering screenwriter and frequent collaborator Jon Raymond based the script on the diaries of women who attempted the trek.
Numerous shots linger on the women — their sidelong glances, smirks and softly uttered asides as they build fires or knit blankets for the frigid Oregon nights — while the men discuss their plans outside the camera’s vision.
Reichardt subtly hints the women are far more in tune with the perils ahead, and it’s a pleasure to watch as each woman develops throughout the film, from Emily’s tenacity to the distress of Kazan’s Millie.
But the film’s most compelling character is the stark sound design, led mostly by ambient noises pierced by the creaking wheels or boots crunching over dead grass.
The sights and sounds are sewn together like intricate patchwork, creating a mounting tension that never fully resolves itself.
It’s not entirely without satisfaction, however, as Reichardt does understand pacing in her own way. Her resistance to lingering in a place or on an emotion for too long creates a momentum that keeps the audience attentive, even if the wagons drag at the pace of exhausted oxen.
As a director, Reichardt is engaging without pulling any tricks from her hat, instead captivating viewers through the raw, visceral power of filmmaking.
She crafts a fine story of life on the Oregon trail without the threats of a poisonous snakebite or dysentery — the sensational plot devices that composed the beloved computer game.
Yes, gun shots are fired and wagons do tumble off course, but Meek’s Cutoff is built around the fear, hysteria and doubt that festers.
Despite taking place more than 150 years before the setting of Wendy and Lucy, it almost feels like a continuation of that film, exploring the elusive American Dream, this time from beneath the canopy of a wagon.
Although Reichardt continues to give us the skeleton rather than the muscle of the story, the bare bones are more than enough when she places the heart, palpitating with a fervent yet quiet intensity, so openly on display.
It’s a rare skill in the current cinematic landscape, and when something like Meek’s Cutoff comes along, those who can watch the grass grow watch it acutely, yearning for more while also faithfully preserving this masterpiece frame by frame.

Ads are everywhere. They surround the buildings we frequent, plaster the publications we read and drive movies and entertainment.
In The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, Morgan Spurlock takes a cheeky look at advertisements and product placement. In the film, Spurlock states, “What I want to do is make a film all about product placement, marketing and advertising, where the entire film is funded by product placement, marketing and advertising.” And he does exactly that.
Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
The film is a refreshingly transparent look at product placement.
In an effort to expose the sneaky way brands advertise, Spurlock opens up the world of advertising and shows it exactly as it is.
From the beginning, Spurlock places himself in the advertising world to expose its truly amusing nature.
At the start of the film, Spurlock gets “branded.” He undergoes a hilarious, extensive psychological test and is eventually told what type of “brand” he is, and what other brands would mesh with him and donate to his film, which he calls “the Iron Man of documentaries.”
Spurlock then cold calls companies, asking for funding for his documentary and mostly getting turned down.
The film is composed of clips of Spurlock meeting with different company executives and pitching his idea for his film that, ultimately, sounds as if it will plummet their business.
Most executives don’t want to help fund a film that would expose the hilariously corrupt world of advertising and probably make their companies look bad, but Spurlock uses the companies that do accept him as proof that businesses will stop at nothing to advertise their products.
Spurlock calls his film a “doc-buster,” putting two things together one would not normally put in the same category: commercial funding and documentaries.
This duality is a running joke throughout the movie.
As Spurlock tries to unlock the mysteries of product placement in a realistic and informative way, he does so in a manner that embraces commercial advertisements.
To showcase the ridiculousness of the advertising world and the ease of product placement, Spurlock throws himself at any company that will fund his film, including JetBlue, Pom, Sheetz, Hyatt and Mane ‘n Tail, to name a few.
The film features hilarious, satirical advertisements — starring Spurlock  himself — for these companies.
His ad for Mane ‘n Tail ends up being the most outrageous, as we see Spurlock sitting in a bathtub with his child and a horse, touting the benefits of the shampoo designed for both human and equestrian use.
Rather than directly attacking advertisers, Spurlock makes fun of them.
Spurlock’s points are grounded in legitimate facts and an intelligent view of product placement, and he manages to point out ridiculous things in a well-meaning, lovingly teasing kind of way.
But the film isn’t all humor.
Spurlock not only presents his own entertaining experiences, but also sits down to speak with other well-known names from all different parts of the advertising world.
Spurlock interviews Big Boi of Outkast, who talks about his problems with advertising, as well as some of the quickest thinkers in the ad world.
He even interviews Ralph Nader, and at one point pulls out a pair of Merrell shoes and begins to tell Nader about the benefits of the shoe company in a jokingly commercial way.
Throughout the film, as Spurlock makes himself something of a walking advertisement, he takes any opportunity to blatantly advertise the products that have funded the film and therefore continue criticizing the advertising world.
Bottles of Pom are in almost every shot; at one point during a TV interview, he wears a suit that is literally a billboard for all the film’s different supporters.
Documentaries have the reputation of being depressing, boring or both, but The Greatest Movie Ever Sold is the exact opposite. Not only is the film enjoyable, it is also witty and informative.
Although it presents a ridiculous and, to some, upsetting situation, it does so in the most hilarious of ways.
Spurlock is like a well-meaning class clown with the intellectual goods to back it up, and his irony and humor make this film a huge success.
Had never heard of this film. Now, I can’t wait to see it! A very enjoyable review. Well done.

Response to Jordan Lee
 
Jordan Lee, in her recent Daily Trojan column “Science and faith are not exclusive” (4/13/11), contributes to what she describes as “the false dilemma — faith in religion or faith in science.”
She quotes a recent speaker, Dr. Peter Atkins, as saying that “a scientist who believes in God is only half a scientist.” Ms. Lee goes on to accuse all academia of sharing this combative viewpoint.
This is unfortunate. While it is true many scientists are not believers, many others have active faith lives, which are fully consistent with robust and rigorous scientific inquiry. This has been explored in some detail, for example, in Prof. Elaine Howard Ecklund’s work examining religious faith in academic scientists.
More unfortunate is that Ms. Lee credits the Discovery Institute for using science to “prove” that Intelligent Design explains evolution. ID is a religious idea based on creationism, although its proponents try to cloak it in the language of science. This was soundly shown in the Kitzmiller v. Dover case in Pennsylvania.
Importantly, ID comes from just one religious viewpoint. Many faith groups find the scientific theory of evolution to be perfectly compatible with their religious beliefs. Ms. Lee might find a particularly interesting discussion of this at the site Evolutionary Christianity. Even the Vatican finds Darwin’s theory compatible with Roman Catholic religious doctrine. There are many comparable examples from other faiths.
Indeed, there is nothing about a scientific understanding of evolution that precludes one from belief in a God, if one is so inclined. But a crucial distinction from ID is that a belief in God is not necessary to explain evolution.
A biologist can have a sense of wonder as she uncovers the mechanisms of life, and whether she credits God or not does not influence the facts she discovers. Religion and science are generally not interested in the same thing. Ms. Lee is correct that it is a false dilemma to set them up in opposition. It would be regrettable, however, if her column contributed to this misunderstanding.

What I find most troubling is the lack  of careful analysis of the specific arguments advanced by Ms. Lee herself.  Having read her article, and the commentary presented by the USC faculty, I cannot help but sense that Ms. Lee’s points were unfairly interpreted. She pointed out that many scientists in academia, though certainly not all, hold the view that people of faith can be only “half a scientist.” The wording of the faculty response reflects such a position: “ID is a religious idea based on creationism, although its proponents try to cloak it in the language of science.” This choice of language clearly communicates the belief that an understanding of the origins of the universe which includes “religious ideas” inconsistent with the current evolutionary consensus cannot be scientifically sound. The authors of the letter to the editor are willing to accept the religious positions that concur with evolutionary theory–all others merely pretend to scientific reasoning. This claim is not supported with evidence and ignores the logical warrants Ms. Lee presents in her article. 
Ms. Lee’s most prominant point, the point most noticably neglected by the faculty response, is the unavoidable reality that intelligent men and women have examined the evidence and found the evolutionary explanation lacking.  She takes care to explain the manner in which ID scientists challenge the explanatory value of Evolutionary Theory. To question the sufficiency of a particular model of the facts is not religious, it is the essence of the scientific method.  It is not a valid argument to simply accuse them of cloaking religion in a scientic garb.  Rather, the opponents of ID are obligated by the parameters of rational, scientific inquiry to demonstrate an error in reasoning. Ms. Lee is calling for a return to the scientific method, a method that does not inherently preclude religious and philosophic committments. Science merely asks “what is?” not “why?” or “to what end?”  One must already hold an epistemological position before proceeding with a scientific investigation.  The scientific community cannot eliminate the possibility of the divine by definition.  Any attempt to define science as materialistic and evolutionary as a means of disproving the argument of ID scientists is mere intellectual bullying, not a logical argument.  I am sure that Ms. Lee welcomes disagreement.  Excluding a view by definition does not constitute thoughtful dissent.
@Diane — The principle of evolution has volumes of DATA to support it’s validity. While it can never be proven to be true (as you say) it is the best TESTABLE model for the origin of life. Eliminate the variable of “believer bias” — the blind acceptable that every word of the Bible is true — then show how any other explanation presented by that text can be tested. Ancient texts by the Greeks tell vast stories about gods in the heavens. We can’t disprove that either. Hindu writings tell of an entirely different realm of the supernatural. We can’t disprove that. If you think that scientists are arrogant, please check yourself in the mirror.
Intelligent Design and Evolution aren’t the only theories of how things got started. To be quite honest, ID is kind of silly in itself, the belief in a literal 6 days of creation even though the bible doesn’t create that. There is a big difference between the theory of ID and actually believing that God created life, the universe and everything. What the bible says is substantiated by science, what ID says is not…
Just thought I’d clear that up.
Oh, the brave faculty of USC’s biology department come out to denounce the very IDEA that Intelligent Design might actually be a superior theory to evolution. I find this show of force to be most amusing. What are you people so afraid of? By the way, professors, evolution is every bit as much an article of faith as is creationism, with a plethora of troubling aspects that you all seem most reluctant to explore. For all your talk of a “scientific understanding of evolution,” it’s just a theory, and you can’t prove it. What’s more, many non-believers (including those at your feared and hated Discovery Institute) are unafraid to ask the hard questions that have you running like a pack of scared little sheep to publish this response. 
By the way, you are entirely mistaken. Religion and science are indeed looking for the same thing. Answers to what life is all about.
Diane, what are your credentials for challenging our esteemed faculty in such a self-indulgent and aggressive comment? Where did you get your advanced training? At what institution did you earn your PhD. Evolution is not a theory. We are way past that concept. Evolution is a model, which can be tested. That is how the scientific method works. We use data to construct the best explanation we can, then we do experiments to try to disprove the model. It typically works pretty well. If you have doubts about the validity and strength of the scientific method, please consider carefully the medical treatments you receive.
Diane: You will notice one strength in the faculties statement that your comment lacks: support. As responsible scientists, they provide evidence and real cases for their clames. You just babble.
OK. So religion might agree with some parts of science, that doesn’t mean that religion is just a fairy tale. God does not exist, there is no reason to think he does. If you want to be a good person, be a good person, you don’t need the fear that an unforgiving god will send you to hell just to be a good person.
Open you eyes.

The refrain that USC isn’t the most environmentally friendly campus has been beaten to death. Our facilities are not swathed in solar paneling and we don’t have wind turbines powering our dining hall kitchens.
But there has been a respectable amount of progress in sustainability at USC in the last year.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified Ronald Tutor Campus Center is up and running. There was the Greeks Gone Green initiative. For Earth Week we had that laser show.
And even though the school year is in its final weeks, the USC administration hasn’t slowed its efforts to make the school competitive with other universities in advancing “green” initiatives. USC Housing and Sustainability are pioneering a number of efforts to make the fall semester even greener. They also seem to be making it easy for students in particular to live more sustainable lifestyles. So to get the most out of the progress those departments are making, students need to expand their dialogue with the administration to ensure we’re all on the same page.
USC Housing is finally beginning to more seriously explore overhauling existing campus buildings to make them LEED-certified.
As a veteran of Trojan Hall’s leaky faucets, temperamental light fixtures and non-existent air-conditioning, I’m only sad this step wasn’t taken when I was a freshman. (Note: LEED-certifying a dorm does not equal air-conditioning. It does, however, promise “strategies that can improve indoor air,” according to the U.S. Green Building Council. So we can at least entertain the possibility of quality air before we grudgingly return to our $19.99 Best Buy fans.)
The university would likely absorb the cost of such an overhaul, meaning students wouldn’t have to pay extra for the upgrade.
The LEED research is just one of the ways the USC administration has kept students in mind. Various water-saving techniques have also been implemented in the residential areas on and around campus, including in the bathrooms and laundry rooms.
And USC Housing has seen to it we won’t have to go far to recycle discarded paperwork and short-lived appliances that have been piling up behind our desks since August, when most of us are packing to leave our dorms and apartments in May.
Starting May 6, it will provide recycling bins for university-owned residential buildings.
Though it will be more than a year before the final decisions are made about additional LEED innovations on campus, the research is being done now. This time next year, we could be leaving a campus environmental advocates and concerned students alike are finding it a lot harder to criticize.
Numerous polls and interviews have shown students are interested in improving sustainability around campus. Now we need to make it clear exactly what kind of progress we want to keep seeing.
If you believe clean energy is what this campus needs, check out USC Beyond Coal. Want to help clean up the trash around Southern California? Try CalPIRG. Write letters to USC Sustainability. Write letters to a newspaper.
The administration has shown during the course of the last year that it’s ready to respond to us — let’s make sure students do their part to keep the (clean) energy going.
 
Kastalia Medrano is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism and an associate managing editor for the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Green Piece,” ran Tuesdays. 
I am really surprised that a leading university such as USC has not gone on the bandwagon on green technology. Green technology is here to stay. Paper is one of the worst environmental hazards of this century. Can we not enter a paperless society? We have the technology do it, so let’s start using it.
The reason that the green movement is slowing down is because
it’s nothing but a FRAUD. You know it. We all know it. If it were grounded
in Truth ( and not in a political agenda ), it would survive & thrive.

We all know digital communication is here to stay, and it makes many things faster and easier. But it also creates more problems.
With social media, friends are counted and categorized, information is given to some but not to others and notifications (or lack thereof) spell out the condition of a person’s social life. This is the landscape of a large portion of communication in the digital age.
Our communication has become quantifiable.
Our emails are saved, along with the time they were sent and who they were sent to. Conversations via text messages are stored in discrete units — it is easy to count a number of replies and look up who replied last or even which text was the awkward one that killed the conversation.
The average user has come to embrace these characteristics, but some things are better left uncounted.
Take Facebook friends. To count how many ‘friends’ you have, you must first decide who is a friend and who is not.
Many Facebook users might go through friend purging. People are added, forgotten and later deleted.
I doubt many people consciously characterized their friends like this until the advent of  social networking.
Applying numbers to things like basic communication with our peers elicits an expectant attitude. But people are not discrete units called “connections.”
There is little we can do, or should do, about stopping quantifiable communication.  We can, however, be conscious of what we are implying when we delete and categorize Facebook friends, and exercise other “privacy settings.”
Unless we are careful recognizing the marginalizing effects of quantifying relationships, we can count on a decline in the distinguishing characteristics that make us human.
 
Alan Wong is a freshman majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.
Like the cliche, “quality, not quantity” is what counts. Prior to Facebook, Friendster, My Space and every other abstract, social online entity, how did people socialize? 
I have lived in the Los Angeles area the vast majority of my life, and we all know that Angelinos are putative for being fake and venal. In other words, we masquerade in the social realm in order to try to get ahead; we try to forge alliances with people whom we believe will enable us to get to the next level, but with a disregard as to whether the relationship is genuinely amicable or not; it’s a dog-eat-dog world.

Violence in the Middle East has spread to Syria, where the army has launched a major military operation in the southern city of Daraa.
Several witnesses reported the bodies of those killed and wounded in the operation lying in the streets.  Another witness reported around 3,000 soldiers in the city breaking into houses and firing randomly on citizens.
Syrian authorities also closed the country’s border with Jordan, preventing citizens from fleeing the offensive. Amnesty international reported at least 75 deaths across the country Friday.
Anti-government protests in Syria began last month following a violent crackdown by security forces against demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths for scribbling graffiti.
 
It’s US intelligence that’s foment the chaos by using facebook,twitter and manipulating the people.. They want to overthrow  the pro-Iranian, pro-Russian assad and put in a US puppet.. It’s mostly the armed gangs that are killing people nothing else.

Lil B, former rapper of The Pack, known for hits such as “Booty Bounce Bopper” and “In My Car,” has created quite a stir in the music world and gay community alike.
He announced last week at the Coachella Music Festival that his latest album will be entitled I’m Gay, and while this act may come across as a cry for attention, given the fact that homosexuality is such a hot topic issue, Lil B claims that this is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the word, to bring “gay” back to its original connotation of happy.
He explains by telling MTV News “I’m very gay, but I love women.  I’m not attracted to men in any way. I’ve never been attracted to a man in my life. But yes I am gay, I’m so happy. I’m a gay, heterosexual male.”
Despite the fact that Lil B is not gay himself, but is instead solely a gay advocate, he has received death threats for his support of the homosexual community. One threat stated, “I’m gonna bash your head in,’ ‘you f****t,’ ‘I’m gonna kill you.’”
Who would have thought that one simple album title could inspire so much hatred?
While he is only one artist, Lil B feels like he can make some sort of influence for the gay community, stating “One-hundred years later, people gonna thank me, because people are going to be free. And that’s the main thing. Even if it’s 1 percent of the people that listen to me and are gonna be free, that’s better than none.  That’s better than not speaking up at all … and I spoke up and I did it.”
Whether it’s a publicity stunt or a call for social change, Lil B is at least opening the connotations of the word ‘gay’ in the media for discussion.
