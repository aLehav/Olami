Former U.S. Representative Jane Harman discussed national security issues on Tuesday as a part of the USC National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE) distinguished speaker series.
Danger zone · Former congresswoman and current president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Jane Harman has been recognized as a national expert in national security and public policy issues. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Harman currently serves as the director, president and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She was appointed president of the center in February of 2011 and said the new position has allowed her a perch to work effectively on the issues she cares about.
“Being in a nonpartisan place where the goal is to connect scholarship to policymaking is great,” Harman said.
From 1993 to 1999, and for a short period in 2011, Harman represented California’s 36th congressional district, which includes part of the Inland Empire.
“What happens in L.A. has a huge impact on what happens in our country,” Harman said.
She emphasized that though al-Qaeda’s power is waning, new loosely affiliated terrorist groups and radicalized individuals are utilizing the Internet to become the face of terror.
“They are evolving,” Harman said. “And we must evolve too. They attack us where we’re vulnerable. We have to be right 100 percent of the time. They have to be right once.”
Harman said the United States can win this fight against terrorism by projecting its values onto other less prosperous countries.
“Failing states are ripe for terrorism,” Harman said. “We have to show people that they have better prospects, that living in this society is fair, the rule of law is here. Opportunity should be out there. Being unemployed at 22 is not good. Some focused help in these failing states on education, on police and on unemployment could help and shows the best of America. We have to live our values.”
In order to do this, Harman said the U.S. must close institutions such as Guantanamo Bay, which she called a “black eye” on the country. She also believed that the U.S. must look internally to identify homegrown individual terrorists, people who are a looming threat to national security.
“In our country, these are lost kids,” she said. “If you are undereducated or alienated, you are susceptible to this trash.”
Harman also said that though the U.S. has improved on sharing information between government agencies — due in part to an intelligence reform bill she helped pass — the current challenge for the country is cyberterrorism.
“We aren’t good enough, and we aren’t creative enough,” Harman said of the nation’s technological capabilities.
But Harman also added that security should not come at the cost of liberty. She contended that drones have no place in the civilian sphere because they have the capacity to destroy Fourth Amendment rights, which protects against unwarranted searches and seizures.
“Security and liberty are not a zero sum game,” Harman said. “You get either more of both or less of both.”
Harman is also a member of the USC Board of Trustees. Her husband, who died in April 2011, founded the USC Sidney Harman Academy of Polymathic Study. The academy seeks to bring awareness to integrated interdisciplinary study through conversational encounters.
USC President C. L. Max Nikias surprised Harman by making an appearance at the end of her discussion.
“How could I not show up?” he said. “She’s been a wonderful trustee and we are all proud of her.”
CREATE is an interdisciplinary national research center based out of the USC Price School of Public Policy and Viterbi School of Engineering, and funded by the Department of Homeland Security. The center focuses on research and development of counterterrorism methods to inform and support decisions made by elected officials. Dean of the USC Price School of Public Policy Jack Knott emphasized not only how key the subject is, but also how knowledgeable about it Harman is.
“There is no more important subject and no more important person to tell us about the subject,” Knott said.
Many students enjoyed the event because they said it informed them about a subject they weren’t previously aware of.
“I didn’t really know about it,” said Aliza Aitchison, a sophomore majoring in international relations and an intern at USC CREATE. “It was helpful to hear about homegrown terrorism and cyberterrorism from such an expert.”

Excuse me, but somehow you mistakenly deleted the second half of my previous post about Ms. Harman, namely this:
” For one of those views, please see the investigative piece “The Marriage From Hell: Jane Harman and the Woodrow Wilson Center”, published in Foreign Policy Journal, here: 
http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/12/16/the-marriage-from-hell-jane-harman-and-the-woodrow-wilson-center/ “
Best wishes to Ms. Harman.  
Some people, however, have quite different views of Ms. Harman, including her being appointed head of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

The latest USG Senate meeting featured presentations from Academic Affairs, the Trojan Pride committee and University Affairs, as well as a presentation from the latest nominee for USG’s Judicial Council. The groups highlighted their plans to renovate campus libraries, promote higher attendance at sporting events and add more facilities to student housing, respectively.
Michael Yoshimura, director of Academic Affairs, announced that his committee wants to start a funding campaign for libraries on campus. The committee’s goal is a $20 million renovation to Leavey Library and eventual construction of a new library on campus.
“Leavey is our most recently built library, and it was built 20 years ago,” said Andrew Menard, the director of University Affairs. “Since then, the whole concept of a library has drastically changed. It’s no longer about books and research — it’s about more space and the ability to work in groups.”
Kyleen Marcella, the director of the Trojan Pride committee, stressed the importance of student attendance at athletic events in her presentation to USG. Marcella emphasized that not all USC athletic events happen in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“Our school is about more than just our football. We have a lot of great programs, but they sometimes get ignored, and it’s kind of sad,” Marcella said.
The Trojan Pride committee has hosted several events including the Fall Sports Rally. Its latest project is spotlighting a “Game of the Week,” to encourage students to go to games for sports other than football.
“Our goal is excitement … We want to raise awareness of events and get a larger attendance,” Marcella said.
Meanwhile, Andrew Menard, the director of University Affairs,  announced his committee’s plans to increase publicity for the farmers’ markets on McCarthy Quad.
“We’re undergoing a huge push right now to get the word out on campus through our committee delegates,” Menard said.
University Affairs also plans to increase the number of printers, exercise machines and water dispensers in student housing.
The meeting ended with a presentation from Kevin Ngai, USG’s latest nominee for Judicial Council.
Ngai, a junior majoring in political science and business administration, said an interest in political issues and his plans for after graduation influenced him to apply for the position.
“After college I want to go to law school, and eventually into corporate law. Corporate law isn’t necessarily the same as interpreting bylaws, but getting used to making these kinds of decisions seems helpful and interesting,” Ngai said.
The next Senate meeting is Tuesday, Oct. 8 in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. All meetings are open to the public.

Though a majority of California voters support Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal to adjust the path of water transportation in order to preserve more than 10,000 acres of wildlife habitat, support dropped by 36 percentage points after being informed of the potential costs.
According to a recent poll by the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times, 51 percent of those polled said they supported the bill prior to being informed of the $25 billion cost of the project.
“There’s no question that Californians understand that something needs to be done to make sure that they have a safe and clean water supply available to them,” said Dan Schnur, director of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll and USC’s Unruh Institute of Politics. “They simply don’t trust state government to make it happen, so they’re very supportive of the governor’s proposal, but when they’re told how much it costs or how much it would cost, that support disappears.”
Several USC students agreed that California’s water crisis is an important issue and supported Brown’s proposal, despite the cost.
“I think the environment is more important than just a piece of paper in your hand because the environment will last forever versus our human civilization, which will not be around forever,” said Hailey Rheinschild, an undeclared sophomore.
Gina Oh, a sophomore majoring in communications, also thought the issue was important to discuss.
“I believe in long-term rather than short-term gratification, and we are in a water crisis,” Oh said. “So it makes more sense to work towards a long term goal of conserving water because we are definitely going to run out at some point.”
Sixty-three percent of Californians polled agreed that there is a water crisis or at least a major problem. Carlos Portela, a senior double majoring in aerospace engineering and physics, admitted that students are not necessarily affected by the water crisis, but said he still supported the bill.
“I feel like college campuses and residences where people don’t specifically pay for utilities have no regard for conserving water,” Portela said. “So people should know that there’s a big problem and start using it more responsibly.”
In addition, more than 80 percent of those sampled said they have adjusted their personal habits to conserve more water. Students also said they have taken measures to conserve water, as well as to protect the environment in general.
“I use a Brita,” said Maren Jorgensen, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “I don’t buy water bottles over and over again. I use the sink and I take short showers.”
Experts worried that despite California voters saying they work to conserve water, few are willing to spend the extra money to help preserve water and the environment.
“Californians have been living with the threat of a water shortage for a long time, yet most remain satisfied with the quality and availability of their water. This contributes to making it more of an ethereal problem than an immediate problem,” Drew Lieberman, vice president of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, told USC News. “As a result, people have little appetite for spending money to address it now, and the shift away from the proposals once we added in the cost component was, frankly, enormous.”

I am glad to see support for the ill conceived Tunnel Plan losing support.
I would like to correct the inaccuracies in this news article though.
First, Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal is not about preserving 10,000 acres of wildlife habitat. They plan to take up to 100,000 acres of rich Delta farmland by eminent domain if needed to flood in a reckless attempt to improve fish species without providing them sufficient fresh water. That is a ludicrous idea. Fish need fresh water. No matter how much “habitat” is created, expecting fish and water fowl to survive in brackish polluted water will not work. These will be further futile attempts to correct the damage being done due to too much fresh water being diverted from the estuary.
Second, the Brown proposal does not make one drop of new water, provides no additional storage and no added reliability for Los Angeles or any other urban users. Furthermore, it will impact Northern California water supplies. Continuing to take as much or more water out of the Delta is not the answer.
Gina Oh has it right – conservation is one of the keys. Another is desalination and recycling to give L.A. self-sufficiency instead of being reliant on water pumped over the Tehachapi’s.
The water crisis is being caused by the continued expansion of crops in the desert central valley (San Joaquin Valley). The big corporate agribusinesses there which take 80 percent of the exported water have expanded their water need by almost 20 percent in the last decade and want to continue to expand. Those arid lands are also ripe for oil fracking. That all spells profit for the big corporate land owners who are paying for the tunnel plan. They are pushing this plan instead of a statewide plan which would benefit all users because with this plan they control the state’s water and can make serious profits. 
Conservation, desalination and recycling for L.A. and other more reasonable approaches bypass their ability to make profit from expanding almond acreage, fracking and reselling their low-cost water shares to developers for enormous profits.
Hzow can you guys state there’s a water shortage when you have the Pacific Ocean in our backyard. Ever heard od a desalinization plant. They work really well anda re use on a global basis.

Bill Maher stopped by Bovard Auditorium on Monday night to deliver a routine that was as politically incorrect as it was funny.

Maher left students laughing as he delivered relentless criticism of his usual victims: religion, the media and the Republican Party.
The event was put together in a collaborative effort by the USC Program Board Speakers Committee, Political Student Assembly, the Performing Arts Committee and USC Spectrum.
Bill Maher launched his own show on HBO, Real Time, after years of heading his own television show, Politically Incorrect, on Comedy Central. In 2005, Maher was named 38 on Time magazine’s 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time. He received a star on Hollywood Boulevard in 2010.
After a roast of GOP statesmen ranging from Rick Santorum to Donald Trump, Maher became more serious when discussing the plight of America’s poor.
“The reason the American dream is unsustainable is because, at its core, it says that everyone should grow up and do better than their parents,” he said. “America is tenth in social mobility, which essentially means we are tenth in the American dream.”
From there, Maher moved to a topic he is perhaps most famous for criticizing in his documentary, Religulous: religion. Referring to the idea of religion as “marketing an invisible product,” Maher emphasized that atheists are the largest minority in America, with their numbers approaching almost one third of people under the age of 33.
Some students were skeptical of the message and strategies Maher’s style promoted.
Giuseppe Robalino, a freshman majoring in business administration, said Maher’s politics often do more harm than good for political change.
“I heard people leaving the auditorium very disillusioned with his cursing,” he said. “This event seems to only promote divisionism and not true examination of the issues at hand.”
Others, however, believed that students were able to sort through and absorb the information.
“As with all comedy, you can take what you want from it,” said Kirstin Louie, a sophomore majoring in classics. “Some of it, you just sit there and you laugh, and then wait for the next thing he says that might be more meaningful.”
When asked about his critics, Maher acknowledged that there are many of them, and said he gets the most hate messages online.
“They’ll never come out to my routines,” he joked. “As long as I don’t read my Twitter feed, I never have to deal with them!”
Jonny Harris, a senior majoring in history and political science, said the Q & A session with students that following Maher’s routine was especially enlightening.
“There were a lot of insightful questions and funny responses,” he said. “Maher can really think on his feet and hit a lot of relevant issues.”
Students can vote on the USC Speakers Committee Facebook page for who the committee should invite to be the next guest. The top three choices as of Tuesday were Stephen Colbert, Jennifer Lawrence and Ryan Gosling.

I this loser was joking about Atheists and Liberals instead I might have paid to see that.
I could be mistaken, but I believe that Politically Incorrect was an ABC show, not a Comedy Central show.  Comedy Central might have picked it up for syndication, but originally it was broadcast in primetime on ABC.

So this week’s trend report is about to get pretty meta. As in, a discussion of hashtags will occur in a column titled #trending. Try to stay with me, folks: This is some serious stuff.
Recently, Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake created a parody video that features them using the word “hashtag” in spoken conversation. Of course, their usage is purely farcical, meant to highlight the absurdity of people whose vernacular is actually overrun by Internet slang.
Internet slang has invaded spoken language probably since the dawn of AOL Instant Messenger, or as we fondly called it, AIM. We would joke about the silly abbreviations we used yet, for convenience’s sake, we continued to use them.
Acronyms such as “brb” and “lol” littered our chat windows like discarded lunchbox items in the cafeteria. Shortening a word by eliminating vowels was just, like, so necessary, you know?
The video is funny and even gives hashtags a useful hand gesture to indicate one’s employment of the symbol. The true genius behind the video, and the reason it became so popular after it aired, is that people recognize there is a grain of truth to the parody.
Our lives, and our language, have become dominated by social media. We pay attention to trending hashtags on Twitter because we want to attract more followers, to catch the eye of other tech users and gain credibility. By using a hashtag, you’re reinforcing your own social awareness.
In creating a hashtag, the chief aim is to gain attention through wit and cultural references. As a result, people use them excessively and, as the video shows, obnoxiously, to prove to others that they are clever. Questlove’s “#stfu” reflects what any normal person would think when confronted by the typical amount of hashtags employed by social media users.
Before its appearance in spoken language, hashtags infiltrated other social media platforms. Originally, it was a tool of Twitter but it soon crossed over to Instagram and has now entered the realm of Facebook.
As a result, the parody of people using “hashtag” as a real word isn’t too far from a possible reality. Who’s to say this will not happen in the future? Take a minute to think about your own vocabulary. You might be surprised at what terms pop up.
When you are surprised by something, have you ever exclaimed “OMG?” If the answer is yes, don’t feel alone. I do it and I’m sure many other people do as well. Even if the use of this Internet acronym is purely ironic, you’re still using it. I’ve even caught myself saying “brb” in real life as a means of excusing myself from company.
Irony is the doorway to doing embarrassing sh-t. You know that one pop band you secretly like that’s on your iPod “just because it’s funny?” That is irony at work. Irony allows people to do silly things as a means of satire — which is exactly what Fallon and Timberlake’s video does.
A friend of mine in middle school didn’t understand what “lol” stood for and he mispronounced it as though it rhymed with “wall.” Ever since, I’ve used this mispronunciation in conversation to signify I think something is humorous on the most basic level. It’s actually pretty similar to how Justin Timberlake uses his endless “lol” hashtag.
What started out as something ironic and not serious has entered my vocabulary and become something I say without thinking. But I’m not the only language-obsessed nerd who pays attention to these trends. Even the Oxford English Dictionary has gotten in on the action, which shocked me since I understood these abbreviations to be inventions of online chat rooms.
Two years ago, “LOL,” “IMHO” and “OMG” were all granted entries in the OED, a gold standard for word etymology and meaning. According to the lauded dictionary, these linguistic shortcuts belong to a category known as initialisms. Surprisingly, these initialisms have histories that predate the Internet. “OMG” makes an appearance in a 1917 letter and “LOL” once stood for “little old lady.”
Does this rising trend signal the degradation of the English language? Def not. Language is constantly evolving. It’s like a living, breathing being that must adapt to the needs of its users — a lot like the Internet, actually.
We can’t expect language to stay the same. If it did, we might still be speaking in Shakespearean verse or, even worse, Middle English. If you’ve never experienced the frustration that is reading Chaucer, consider yourself lucky — it is a trying experience that will make you wish the man had just used a damn spell-checker.
Whether you refer to them as “initialisms,” acronyms or just annoying trends, these modern word formulas are just the next step in the evolution of language. They’re almost reminiscent of George Orwell’s Newspeak from 1984. Minus the eerie socialist connotation, Newspeak and hashtags both strive for brevity and efficiency.
For a wordy writer like me, formulating a tweet is torture. Keeping a thought under 140 characters is never an easy feat. It feels restrictive. In a way, though, it does help to concentrate the message in fewer words and more content.
With any luck, language will evolve gracefully, as it has done in the past. The trend of using hashtags as a means of expression can stay as long as thoughtfully constructed sentences can stick around as well.
Well, g2g. Bye.

Los Angeles might be a seasonless urban wasteland, but that doesn’t mean you have to abandon the traditions that make the autumnal season so eagerly anticipated.
Autumn in other cities might mean time to bundle up in scarves and sweaters, but here, you can keep your Rainbows and your bro tank on year-round while also partaking in some of the season’s best eats. The staff of the Daily Trojan assembled a collection of recipes to get you in the spirit of fall.
 
Rosemary Lemon Roasted Pork Belly
 
Nothing says comfort food like pork belly — the flavorful, fatty cut of pig is the same used to make bacon — but the uncured version has become a mainstay in some of the city’s finest restaurants. Pork belly is also cheaper than most other cuts of meat, so you won’t have to break the piggy bank to whip up this comfort classic.
 
Ingredients:
1 1/2 – 2 pounds pork belly, trimmed and cut into a square shape (about one quarter of a belly)
5-6 sprigs of fresh rosemary
1/2 brown onion, cut into four wedges
1/2 lemon, cut into four wedges
Olive oil
Salt, fresh ground pepper
1/4 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup white wine, for deglazing
Boiling water
 
First, score the pork across the top (the skin) diagonally with one inch between each cut. Then start from the other side of the belly so that the diagonal cuts intersect and create a diamond shape. Next, pour boiling water over the surface of the pork. This creates the crispy crackling that separates from the rest of the meat when the belly is done cooking.
Season the skin and the underside with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Heat olive oil in a stainless steel pan (or any other oven-safe pan) over medium-high heat, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees with the rack placed on the bottom.
Sear the pork belly, skin side up, on the pan for three to four minutes or until the bottom is slightly browned. Remember to lay the pork belly in the pan starting with the side closest to you and ending away from you so that the hot oil doesn’t burn you. Turn the pork belly over and sear skin-side down for another 3 minutes. Place lemon wedges and onions around the belly of pork and top with rosemary (careful!) and then cover with an oven-safe lid or aluminum foil. Put the pan in the oven and cook for 25 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven and transfer pork, onions, lemon and four sprigs of rosemary from the pan to a serving dish — again, the pan will be very hot, so be careful — and let it rest.
In the meantime, put the pan back on the stove at medium heat. Pour in half a cup of white wine and deglaze the pan — scrape up the caramelized pork with a wooden spoon, and stir quickly.  Add chicken stock and reduce. Remove the rosemary sprig and transfer the gravy to a serving bowl or gravy boat. Slice pork, garnish with onions, lemon and rosemary and serve with gravy.
Baked Sweet Potato Fries
 
If you’re craving something salty and sweet this season, give this simple but tasty recipe for sweet potato fries a try. This particular recipe balances the heft of baked sweet potatoes by cutting through the denseness of the dish with a fresh citrus bite from the lime.  These sweet potato fries would be delicious paired with a poultry dish or by themselves as a healthy snack.
 
Ingredients:
2 medium sweet potatoes
Extra-virgin olive oil
Coarse salt
1 lime wedge
 
 
First, place oven racks in the center of the oven and preheat it to 400 degrees. Clean and cut the sweet potatoes into 1/4 inch batons. Place in a bowl. Drizzle the potatoes with olive oil and toss them gently until evenly coated, then spread them out on two rimmed baking sheets. Bake the potatoes, flipping once, until the centers are soft and edges are crisp — about 22 to 25 minutes. Move the potatoes to a serving dish, sprinkle with salt and serve with lime wedges.
Almond Pumpkin Cheesecake
 
An alternative to the overdone pumpkin pie present at most autumn gatherings, a modified cheesecake is more satisfying — and, let’s face it — more impressive than most basic fall dessert staples. For something sweet to cap off a big meal, try this classic with a fall twist. The creaminess of the pumpkin-flavored cream cheese filling combined with the crunch of the sweet almond topping and graham cracker crust brings two desserts together for one decadent cheesecake.
 
Ingredients:
 
For the cheesecake:
1 2/3 cups of graham cracker crumbs
1 cup of sugar, divided
1/4 cup of sliced almonds, chopped
5 tablespoons of margarine or butter, melted
3 packages (8 oz. each) of cream cheese, softened
1 cup of solid, packed canned pumpkin
1/2 cup of sour cream
2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice
4 eggs
For the almond crunch topping:
1/4 cup of firmly packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons of butter
1/2 cup of shredded coconut
1/2 cup of sliced almonds
 
Preparation for the cheesecake:
If you will be using a silver nine-inch springform pan, preheat the oven to 350 degrees (or to 325 degrees if using a dark nonstick springform pan). Combine 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs, sugar, almonds and margarine until well mixed. Press firmly onto bottom and two inches up the sides of the pan; set aside. Beat cream cheese and remaining 2/3 cup sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until well-blended. Add pumpkin, sour cream and spice; mix well. Add eggs one at a time while beating on low speed. Pour the mixture into the crust and bake for one hour. Then, turn off the oven and let the cheesecake stand in oven for 30 minutes.
 
Preparation for the almond crunch topping:
Cook the sugar and butter in small saucepan on medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Add the coconut and almonds. Spread the topping over the cheesecake while it is still warm. Broil the entire cheesecake for 2 minutes or until golden brown. Let the cheesecake cool before removing the rim of the pan. Refrigerate for at least four hours before serving.
Pumpkin Spice Latte
 
You’ve spent all year waiting for its return to Starbucks, but why not whip up a homemade version of your favorite sweet and spicy beverage year-round? This warm, frothy treat is perfect for chilly mornings before class or cozy evenings by the fire, and you can even save the syrup for use throughout the season.
Ingredients:
 
For the pumpkin spice syrup:
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/3 cup canned pumpkin
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground all spice
 
For the latte:
3/4 cup milk, steamed or foamed
2 tablespoons pumpkin spice syrup, or to taste
2 shots espresso
Whipped cream, for topping (optional)
Cinnamon, for topping (optional)
 
For the syrup:
Combine water and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat and stir often until sugar dissolves completely into water. Add pumpkin and spices, and whisk until smooth. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent boiling. Remove from heat and allow the liquid to cool for about 30 minutes. Strain if desired. Transfer to a container and store in the refrigerator. Shake well before use.
 
Preparation for the latte:
Place desired amount of pumpkin syrup in cup. Add espresso or coffee and stir to combine. Pour frothed or steamed milk on top and stir lightly. Top with whipped cream and a dash cinnamon for extra spice.
 
Autumn is a time for gathering with friends and family — and enjoying rich comfort food. These four recipes are sure to help you “fall” into a food coma.

There aren’t many rappers whose favorite band is Arcade Fire, who record songs with Insane Clown Posse, or who flirt incessantly with Kathy Griffin, but Danny Brown is that rapper. As a 32-year-old rapper Brown told The Guardian, the title Old is not referring to his age but actually to the fact that he’s been around so long in the rap game, and like the song “Side A” says, older fans want “that old Danny Brown” back.
Not so Old · Detroit rapper Danny Brown initially drew interest from 50 Cent’s record label, but eventually signed to Fool’s Gold Records. – Courtesy of Fool’s Gold Records
The “old Danny Brown” first surfaced as a member of the group Reser’vor Dogs in the mid-2000s before releasing his mixtape, Detroit State of Mind, and going on to record The Hybrid and XXX. With Old, Brown brings a new spirit and style to rap using increasingly alternative beats and samples that make it a strong candidate for multiple listens while simultaneously setting a higher standard for hip-hop from here on out.
Brown hails from Detroit, the city that has produced venerated lyricists such as Eminem and Royce Da 5’9”. But Brown isn’t nearly as serious as his Motor City contemporaries. He can most commonly be seen posing for photos with his tongue out and showing off his missing tooth — and as wild as his appearance might be, his lyrics and delivery match up to the hype.
Side A of the album gives fans “that old Danny Brown” and features a deep look into his past in Detroit where he witnessed a lot of violence, drug use and eventually began selling drugs. On “25 Bucks,” Brown spits impressively intricate rhymes about trying to make a few dollars. This track features beats and vocals from Canadian electro-pop act Purity Ring, who previously featured Brown on a remix of their song “Belispeak II.”
Specifically on “Torture,” he paints a picture of a memory in Detroit and depicts his desensitization to violence in a lower, downcast voice than what listeners are used to. He says, he “was like f-cking 7-years old / When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove.” In “Gremlins,” Brown recalls hustling becoming repetitive and how “school becomes a free meal / street becomes a cheap thrill.”
He gets personal on the first half of the album, even mentioning a daughter, referring to the child his high school girlfriend had with someone else but Brown took in as his own. He even laments not being able to spend as much time with her as he’d like. It is at this point that listeners see a true evolution of Brown as an artist.
Side B of the album marks the extreme change in mood on Old where he switches from reminiscing and delves into the party scene and drug culture with songs such as “Dip,”  “Smokin & Drinkin” and “Kush Coma.”
On these songs, he has fun with his sound and skips the unusually low voice for his distinctive high-pitched, sometimes shrill voice. “Dip” features an electronic beat that samples Freak Nasty’s 1996 “Da’ Dip.” The song refers explicitly to the use of MDMA, which Brown has been an active supporter of since its recent transition into rap culture. It is arguably the most hyped-up song on the album with Brown saying, “Off a half a gram of Molly / We about to go party and I don’t know what I’m doing” throughout.
Side B continues to keep the party going with many highlights such as “Break It (Go),” for which Brown recruited Scottish producer Rustie. Together, they create a trap song sure to be seen as twerk-worthy by his massive amount of female fans. “Kush Coma” features A$AP Rocky in an explicit portrayal of marijuana use that seems to glorify the substance but carries a more serious undertone about the two sides to a lifestyle of partying when Brown says, “All these drugs up in me / It’s a miracle I ain’t mirror Kurt” (referring to Kurt Cobain).
Brown’s characteristic voice and eccentric and explicit lyrics made his last album, XXX, an immediate hit. Those qualities certainly reappear on Old, but it carries a more sophisticated and polished sound. While he featured some expected collaborations on Old, such as Ab-Soul and Freddie Gibbs, he also introduced some surprising choices of artists such as Purity Ring and British pop star Charli XCX. Brown’s eclectic range of lyrical subjects mixed with his use of obscure producers such as Paul White, Rustie and Detroit producer SKYWLKR, who infuse techno and U.K. grime sounds into the album create an unprecedented style of hip hop production.
The album concludes with “Float On,” a slower, dreamy track on which Brown talks about it still continuing to be a struggle at the end of the day to cope with everything he’s seen and deal with the stress of writing raps for a growing audience. He raps, “You can never understand all the pressure I’m against / Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last sh-t,” conveying some of the stresses and anxiety that come with success in hip-hop fame.
The track provides the perfect closure for an album that’s one part painful memories and one part a look into a drugged-out lifestyle to ultimately focus deeper on Danny Brown as a human being. As the track comes to a close, Brown talks about his fear of fading away under rap’s continuously changing landscape and burning out from drug use. Brown’s proposed solution is simply to stay more focused on his craft. The result of that focus is Old, an album that easily marks the pinnacle of Brown’s career to date.

My first memory of USC football isn’t very inspiring; it’s of former Kansas State standout Terrence Newman streaking down the sideline to score on a blocked point after touchdown attempt from USC kicker David Davis. USC ultimately lost that game 27-20, and I’ll never forget my dad, a diehard fan, lamenting the loss as typical of USC football. Clearly, he was still scarred from the Paul Hackett regime.
The next game was better, a 22-0 victory over Oregon State, and so was the rest of the season. It happened to be the year former head coach Pete Carroll’s famed no-loss November streak started. In between the Friday night thrashing of a highly-ranked Notre Dame team, a Heisman trophy for Carson Palmer, and a resounding Orange Bowl victory against Iowa, I was hooked.
Looking back on those days now, considering the current state of the Trojans, I am able to appreciate the high points of being a fan. The numerous low points of the Lane Kiffin era have given me a new perspective.
The first time I took an interest in USC football coincided with the program beginning one of the most successful runs in college football history. I remember the high points with glee — Darnell Bing’s interception against Auburn in the first game of Matt Leinart’s career, the Wild Bunch II dominating Michigan in the 2004 Rose Bowl victory and the Trojans completely overpowering Oklahoma in the 2005 Orange Bowl en route to a national championship. Most importantly, there was the feeling that at the end of every season, USC was the team no one, including those powerhouse SEC teams, wanted to play.
There were, of course, some low points as well; the final 6:42 minutes of the 2006 Rose Bowl against Texas come to mind. After that loss, I told my dad there was no chance I was going to school the next day because I needed time to cope, and he explained that I had it easy compared to some of the low points that he endured before I was born. That notion became the recurring theme after each subsequent disappointing loss, be it to Stanford or Oregon State or any of the other sneaky teams in the old Pac-10.
He was right though — being a USC fan during the Pete Carroll era was easy, and it most definitely was fun. We watched a high-octane offense and an aggressive defense week in and week out, a team filled with future NFL players that lit up the scoreboard and had fun in the process.
That’s why, when thinking about the Kiffin era, I have a certain level of gratitude. He showed me what it is like to be a true fan, and to watch mediocrity and haphazard playcalling and still root just as hard.
Maybe it’s because I’ve been spoiled as a Trojan fan, or it could be the eternal optimism in me, but with the talent at USC, I always feel as if they should win when they take the field. I still maintain a sliver of hope that this year’s team can rally and still have success by season’s end. When that level of expectation is there, it hurts to watch the losses pile up. The disappointment takes a toll on even the most loyal supporters.
I know how irrational it is to be a diehard fan, to center the fall weekend schedule on  12 three-and-a-half-hour games. It’s weird to get so excited and angry about something so far out of your control, but when there is that level of passion, it is upsetting to watch a team fail to fulfill its immense potential. And boy, have these last 13 months been upsetting as a fan.
Out of all this though, I learned what it is to be a true supporter. I always wondered how fans could commit to rooting for a perpetually disappointing team such as the Cleveland Browns, but now I know. When USC was losing against Georgia Tech last year, or Arizona State on Saturday, it was tough to swallow, but I never considered turning the game off or leaving. I, along with most of the Trojan faithful, kept watching until the end — hoping, wishing for some type of miracle.
If you watch long enough, you never know what you might see. The comeback against ASU might not have happened, but fans who didn’t leave the stadium or change the channel on TV were rewarded when they saw the start of what could be an incredible career for freshman tailback Justin Davis. Watching him skirt through the defense and cut back on long runs faintly reminded me of the famous Reggie Bush run against Fresno State, even though that play seems like it occurred several decades ago.
Out of that tough loss came a glimpse of Davis’ potential, and that is the type of positive signs that I will look forward to next Thursday against Arizona. Watching the Trojans lose more times in the last 12 games than they did in five years with Carroll didn’t turn me away from the program. It strengthened my resolve as a fan — always yearning for the next game to see USC turn that corner.
Admittedly, even after Kiffin’s firing, the football team has a bevy of problems to deal with. But I have faith that this program can rise from the proverbial ashes and reclaim its glory. As that process happens, I’ll be tuning in week in and week out as a fan, win or lose. That’s what we do as fans — we stick with the team through the good and the bad, because that’s what sports are all about. It would be too easy to just call it quits when things get a little tough.
So thank you, Lane Kiffin, for showing me that I will still be a fan even in the worst of times. And when I say worst of times, I understand it’s all relative — it can always get worse. After all, we could be Bruins.

well written article and I love the ending…
Go Trojans and Fight On….
During the the PC era the football team was forced to vacate the final two wins of its 2004 national championship season, as well as all of its wins in 2005. It was also banned from bowl games in both 2010 and 2011 and was docked 30 scholarships over three years.
Shortly after the NCAA handed out its penalties, the Football Writers Association of America announced it would no longer recognize the Trojans as its 2004 national champion. In June 2011, the Bowl Championship Series stripped the Trojans of the 2004 BCS title.
Bush is the first person in the Heisman Trophy’s history to give his trophy back to the Heisman Trust, and the 2005 season is the only one in the award’s history for which there is no winner.
good article…even got a laugh or two.    I also remember the Hacket years.
Right.  Good article.  And speaking as a decades-long SC fan, I can tell you that, win or lose against Arizona, Coach Orgeron WILL have the Trojans fully mobilized with whomever is able to play.  And motivated?  Are you serious?  Would you like to be in Arizona’s shoes, with SC in full-recovery mode and pride on the line?  As we all know, Fight On does not mean Wuss On.  I am not a violent person by nature but can you imagine the ouchies, the aches and the depression those poor dudes are going to have to take back to Arizona?
Jake, what a nice andr efreshing perspective you have presented. Very well written Rticleand it was an enjoyable read.

When Elizabeth Eddy was an All-American soccer recruit out of Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, Calif., most college coaches could only half-heartedly recruit her. Everyone knew where she’d spend her collegiate career.
Versatility · USC senior Elizabeth Eddy plays forward and midfielder for the soccer team, as well as playing for the USC women’s lacrosse team. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“When I talked to them on the phone, they really knew I was going to USC,” Eddy said. “They’d say, ‘I know you like USC, but here’s our school…’ I’m like, ‘Oh, that’s cool.’”
Eddy, now a senior forward for USC, is part of a long lineage of athletes to come through Troy. Her father played water polo at USC. Her uncle played football for the Trojans. Her grandfather did too, in addition to swimming for USC. Her great grandfather was the head administrator for the athletic department in the 1930s and early 1940s. And her brother, Park, is a redshirt freshman driver on the water polo team.
“I would say my family bleeds cardinal and gold,” Eddy said. “Since I was a kid, it’s been my dream to come here.”
Even though Eddy isn’t the first athlete in her family to play her collegiate career at USC, she is probably the best — and she’s definitely the most versatile.
Eddy was on the surfing and track teams in high school and also plays lacrosse for the newly-founded varsity team. But it hardly stops there — even as a double-sport athlete who picked up a lacrosse stick for the first time last spring, she wishes she could don the cardinal and gold even more.
“I’d love to play water polo and tennis, but they’re in the same season as lacrosse,” Eddy said. “I’d wanna play volleyball and basketball too but they all overlap, so you have to pick and choose … I just love learning new things and competing.”
But Eddy’s true calling is undoubtedly on the pitch.
She’s played virtually every position for the Women of Troy over the last four years except goalkeeper, and has excelled at each spot on the field.
“Because she can play end line to end line, I don’t think you could put her in a role that limits her strength, which is her fitness,” USC women’s soccer head coach Ali Khosroshahin said.
As a freshman who rotated between forward and midfielder, Eddy was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman Team and became the first USC player to record a hat trick since 1997 when she netted three goals against California.
As a sophomore forward, she led the squad in scoring with four goals and earned All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention.
Her play mostly went unrecognized during her junior year as her stats declined while playing primarily defense as a leader on the young backline. But Eddy is back in the spotlight as a forward this season, leading the Women of Troy and matching her career high of five goals despite missing two matches with a minor injury.
After scoring three goals in the Women of Troy’s first two matches, she was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week, the first USC player to garner that honor since 2010.
“I would not be surprised if she was the greatest athlete at USC,” Khosroshahin said. “I never have to worry about her being fit or strong enough to perform.”
What might be even more impressive is that many say the most outstanding thing about Eddy is not her athletic ability, but her contagious sense of enthusiasm and diligence in preparing for competition.
“She just has that natural positive aura about her that makes everyone excited to play,” junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley said. “A change from last season is that we’re back to the little girls in all of us that adore soccer. It sounds so dorky, but you can see how much joy it’s bringing her, which helps all of us.”
Khosroshahin said that Eddy’s passion for athletics is one of her defining attributes and partly why she was so highly coveted by top-tier programs across the nation such as Stanford, Cal, and Notre Dame out of high school.
“We’re always looking for kids who don’t need that motivation, who already have that work ethic,” Khosroshahin said. “Hers was through the roof, and it always has been.”
Her outgoing personality and easily identifiable curly locks have made her a recognizable figure on campus — during the interview for this article, several groups of students interrupted to greet Eddy with hugs.
And though some might let adoration and accolades get to their heads, Eddy maintains an admirable sense of maturity and grasp on her deep-rooted Christian values.
“To me, that’s more important than sports,” Eddy said. “All that stuff fades — the glory, losses, fame, defeat … it matters, but not all that much. It’s more important how you compete and why you compete.”
Though so many players get caught up in their athletic endeavors, Eddy has her sights on the bigger picture.
“I’d say everybody comes to this point, but there’s been moments where I’ve been like, ‘What am I doing? What’s the point? What’s worth living for?’” Eddy said. “What it comes down to is there’s literally nothing else in life worth living for except what I believe to be the truth — [if you] live for God and glorify him with your life, in the end you’ll be rewarded with heaven. Because that’s the foundation — that determines how I tackle stuff in life.”
No matter your motivations or beliefs, it’s easy to agree that Eddy has at least been making the Trojan Family proud.

The defending national champion USC women’s golf team claimed another victory Tuesday, setting multiple team and individual school records in the process.

The No. 1-ranked squad outlasted tough conditions, tight competition and scorecard confusion at the two-day Windy City Collegiate Championship near Chicago to win its record fifth consecutive match in a streak dating back to last spring. The win also marks the first time a USC team has opened a season with back-to-back wins.
In two rounds on Monday and Tuesday, the Women of Troy combined for a score of 1-over, two strokes ahead of No. 16 Oklahoma State. Pac-12 rivals  No. 7 Arizona and No. 12 Stanford finished in a third place tie, and host Northwestern rounded out the top five. With the victory, USC has now won a remarkable eight out of its last nine events.
Once again leading the way for the top-ranked Women of Troy was standout sophomore Kyung Kim, who didn’t miss a beat after her season-opening victory at the Dale McNamara Fall Preview. Kim set her own school record on Monday, extending her streak of consecutive rounds in the 60s to five. Unfortunately for the sophomore, windy conditions derailed the chance of another victory. A final round 2-over 73 knocked Kim to 4-under for the tournament and forced her into a second place tie with Oklahoma State’s Julie Yang in the individual race. Arizona’s Lindsay Weaver went on to win with a score of 5-under.
Freshman Karen Chung made a strong impression in her collegiate debut finishing just behind Kim at 1-over for the tournament, good for sixth place.
Defending NCAA individual champion sophomore Annie Park would have tied Kim for the team’s lowest score, but the sophomore’s final round 1-under 70 was disqualified because of confusion in regards to her scorecard. After it was determined that Park signed an incorrect card, the Women of Troy’s ten-stroke lead seemed in jeopardy. Fortunately for the team, clutch late birdies by Kim, junior Doris Chen and freshman Gabriella Then secured a two-stroke victory.
Chen finished the tournament tied for ninth with a score of 3-over. The junior fired 15 pars and two birdies in a stellar final round to negate a difficult 4-over performance the day before. Chen was the only USC player to score under par on Tuesday, and claimed one of the field’s best scores, wind and all.
Without Chen’s stellar play, Park’s disqualification might have sunk USC’s chances at victory. Then struggled in her second collegiate event with a 9-over overall score, but her birdie on the final round’s 18th hole helped the Women of Troy hold off Oklahoma State for the victory. Park, disqualified for her final round, filled out the team standings. The sophomore was unable to take credit for a performance that would have tied her with Kim and Yang for second place overall.
The Women of Troy will next compete in the Stanford Intercollegiate from Oct. 25 to 27. Last year the team won the event behind then-freshman Kim’s first collegiate victory.

According to CNN, cries of “Osama” and “terrorist” echoed through the streets near Central Park on Sept. 21 when Prabhjot Singh, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, became a victim of a hate crime when a mob of 12 to 15 people attacked him.
Emily McPeek | Daily Trojan
It appears that ignorance and intolerance within the United States continues to plague the nation more recently than ever before because yet another Sikh hate crime occurred in New York City just last week.
But there’s one glaring disturbance about this vicious assault: Singh is a Sikh. In the U.S., Sikhism has become synonymous with Islam because of those who associate the turbans and full beards of Sikhs with those of Muslims. The unsettling assault on Singh is an addition to a seemingly large number — more than 700 Sikh-related hate-crimes have been reported since 9/11, according to the Sikh Coalition — that clearly showcases a lack of education about the Sikh religion.
The majority of Americans remain in the dark when it comes to recognizing the religion as exemplified by Singh’s case. Singh, who co-authored a 2012 New York Times op-ed on Sikh hate crimes in the U.S., was left bruised with a fractured jaw after becoming a victim of hate crime himself when assailants mistakenly took him for a Muslim.
According to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, nearly 70 percent of the U.S. does not recognize the difference between a Sikh and a Muslim.
Sikhism is the world’s fifth most popular religion. The monotheistic faith emphasizes equality and service to all. Of the 25 million Sikhs in the world, roughly 700,000 reside within the U.S.
The violence and hatred spurned by the ignorant mistaking of peaceful Sikhs for extremist Muslims occurs frequently and is widespread, from regular reports of Sikh school children in New York being called “Bin Laden” or “terrorist” to the fatal Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting by a neo-Nazi that took place just over a year ago.
The fact that these sorts of attacks continue to occur is an indication of the lack of general education regarding both religions. There should at least be some silver-lining in the hope that out of these attacks comes a lesson, yet still Sikhs continue to wrongly become the targets of anti-Islam attacks time after time.
Most Americans remain largely politically and socially unaware due to their own folly. Hopefully, Americans will one day be able to recognize the difference between Sikhs and Muslims and become less violent toward others.

I’m afraid the ignorance of those perpetrating hate crimes would be just as pronounced even if directed at Muslims however ‘correctly’ identified..
Thank you for highlighting this ongoing issue facing Sikhs in their everyday lives.  In a yet another incident after the one you have covered, a Mississippi court judge seems even the worst since judges are supposed to be unbiased and proivde justice. 
Sikhs being lumped together is as understandable or reprehensible as people lumping together “white people” as a common group with the assumption all white people have the same thoughts and beliefs. Why is it we are not up in arms whenever we hear some sanctimonious politician, celebrity, journalist decry that “white people” just don’t get this or that or understand, etc? If we are going to have an honest discussion about race – which I am told we desperately want to have in the US – then let’s expose the hypocrisy and really talk about the truth and NOT make stupid one-sided arguments that only inflame emotions and ultimately just cry for more fist shaking at the MAN.

I remember a time when BlackBerry phones were the epitome of cool. I was in the seventh grade, and any kid who managed to score one of the iconic phones was basically skyrocketed to instant popularity. Back then, even the concept of a regular cell phone was foreign and exciting. But phones with keyboards? They were too cool for words. The ability to send e-mails through a wireless network was unheard of and unparalleled by any other type of device, which led the phones to be nicknamed “CrackBerry” phones because of their addicting nature. They were the smartest phones around.
Ah, those were the days -— before the iPhone and Android takeover. It was a much simpler time. Back then, BlackBerry phones were the easy choice for people who needed to stay connected to their e-mail on the go. BlackBerry’s creator, Research in Motion, made the first steps toward providing cell phone users not just with the ability to make phone calls, but an experience as well.
Fast forward just a few years, however, and purchasing a BlackBerry has become the last choice for potential smartphone consumers. The apps are unimpressive and the operating system leaves much to be desired. The amount of BlackBerry users has dwindled, and other smartphones are threatening the BlackBerry’s very existence. What happened to all of the CrackBerry fanatics?
The company couldn’t keep up with emerging competition, mainly the Apple iPhone and Google Android smartphone devices. According to The Globe and Mail, an error in strategy was responsible for BlackBerry’s demise.
BlackBerry marketed its phones to professionals, but failed to take into account the average consumer. As customers started to look for phones that doubled as entertainment systems, with built in apps, BlackBerry stayed focused on its utilitarian corporate design.
Since the iPhone boom in 2007, the company has been steadily declining in profitability and popularity, leaving its loyal users to wonder at what point to retire their beloved CrackBerry phones. Well, that time might have come at last.
BlackBerry announced Monday that the firm would be taken over by Fairfax Financial, a Canadian insurance company and the company’s largest shareholder. This news came after the announcement that BlackBerry had suffered layoffs of 4,500 employees and a $1 billion quarterly loss as a result of a failed released smartphone.
In other words, the company’s future isn’t looking too bright.
That is, unless Fairfax can reorganize the company’s goals so that it takes charge again. BlackBerry once had the innovation and skills necessary to capture almost half of the U.S. smartphone market share, and although that seems unlikely at this point, who’s to say they can’t do it again?
BlackBerry needs to stop trying to appeal to the average user and focus on their niche market, the consumers who so loyally have stuck with their favorite BlackBerry phones for all of these years. These consumers prefer the physical keyboard and secure e-mail access to all of the bells and whistles of an iPhone or Android device. Simple communication is their first and foremost priority. The problem is that there are so few of these consumers left, and BlackBerry will certainly struggle to capture new consumer interest.
Which is why, if I’m being perfectly honest, the company might do well to just throw in the towel. The BlackBerry name itself is tainted, has forever lost that coolness factor that was so enthralling back in my middle school days. And as much as I wish I could fawn over another BlackBerry, I am simply unimpressed by its last smartphone attempt and am hesitant to believe that going private will really do anything to help save the company.
Indeed, the conclusion of the BlackBerry age may be upon us, and there is nothing that CrackBerry addicts can do about it, except appreciate and remember the groundbreaking technology that BlackBerry once embodied.
The most impressive aspect of the BlackBerry is that it was the first step towards creating the types of smartphones that are so popular and cool today. BlackBerry is the very reason we even have e-mail on our smartphones today, and paved the way for future technologies to help reinvent the way we communicate.
The BlackBerry phone was a crucial step in smartphone history, but maybe that’s all it will ever amount to — just a piece of history. But one thing is certain: We will forever remember the BlackBerry as the first smartphone to ever have the “cool” factor.
