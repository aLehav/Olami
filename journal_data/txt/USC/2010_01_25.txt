After teaming up to provide emergency medical relief in Haiti over the course of five days, USC Keck School of Medicine doctors and Los Angeles County medical professionals returned to Los Angeles Saturday and were scheduled to return to work at County Hospital Monday.
“We were disappointed we were not able to continue our work for a longer time period,” Dr. Ramon Cestero, the group’s team leader and an LAC + USC Medical Center trauma surgeon, wrote on a blog created to record the doctors’ experiences.
Cestero added that the arrival of new medical teams to Haiti reassured the Keck team that those still in need of medical care would be in good hands. The Keck team was among the first medical personnel to arrive in Haiti, according to Bayard Veiller, chief of staff to Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito and the logistical coordinator for the team.
“We got our team there 48 hours before the 82nd Airborne got there,” he said.
The specialized trauma unit — made up of 10 surgeons, critical care doctors and nurses — worked in difficult conditions to afford Haitians with medical care.
“We feel that we made a significant impact on the several hundred patients we saw and treated who otherwise would not have received medical and surgical care in a timely manner without our involvement,” said Cestero, who worked for 28 hours straight to provide ailing Haitians with much needed aid during the trip.
In addition to performing surgeries, Cestero and his colleague, Dr. Henri Ford, vice dean of medical education for the Keck School, chief of surgery for Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and a native Haitian, sent photographs and messages back to share their first-hand experiences in the earthquake-devastated country.
“It’s amazing that they’re able to do that. It really gives everyone the opportunity to understand what it’s like to do this kind of work and what’s it’s like for the poor people of Haiti who have suffered this horrible tragedy,” Veiller said.
In the absence of the trauma physicians and staff from County, the schedules of other hospital personnel were adjusted to fill the gaps.
“We fully staffed the emergency department at County while these people were gone.  So no, there were no lapses in coverage here at all,” Veiller said.

For everyone that has been unable to look away from the train wreck/socio-anthropological experiment that is Jersey Shore, this week has been harsh. The season finale of short-lived-yet-perpetually-offensive reality show — which follows tan-and-gel obsessed Italian-Americans living in a summer rental in Asbury Park — finally aired last Thursday and aside from reruns that will take MTV straight through Spring Break, our lives have had to return to their natural, pre-Guido state.
But who wants to do that? Certainly not anyone who enjoys obsessing over people who obsess over themselves so much that it backfires and they end up becoming cartoon versions of their former selves (And especially not Wendy Williams, who shelled out Snooki’s $10,000 per appearance fee to give the girl a makeover).
The attention-loving reality stars are soaking up their newfound fame and using the interest in their pathetic lives to hawk themselves at every PR opportunity. But even if you can’t make it to their arrest-filled suburban club appearances or are having trouble tuning in to daytime talk shows, there are many ways you can relive the magic that was the first (and hopefully last) season of Jersey Shore. At least until Snookin’ For Love (our best guess name for Snooki’s in-the-talks dating show) airs or JWoww and Pauly D pose nude (it’s only a matter of time).

In the midst of study abroad week, which gives students a chance to explore the various available options for going abroad, the Office of Overseas Studies has noted recent changes in students’ choices of destination and in the majors of those choosing to travel.
The number of students choosing to travel to Europe has remained steady, but the number of students going to South Africa to study has gone up 38 percent since spring 2009, according to the USC Office of Overseas Studies.
“We are not exactly sure why,” said Veronica Gomez, the program assistant for Overseas Studies. “The only reason that we have thought of as to why it has increased is that students could be interested in seeing the World Cup.”
Students not studying with the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences have also begun to study abroad more; the program saw a 54 percent increase in the number of Viterbi students going abroad through the Office of Overseas Studies this spring.
“It’s because we have advertised that engineering students can get engineering credit through our program, and that is why we have seen an increase of engineering majors,” Gomez said. “The engineering school offers a study abroad program, but there are more options for them through our program.”
Students who major in international relations still remain the most likely to study abroad through the Office of Overseas Studies.
Other majors, including psychology, neuroscience and political science, have all seen significant jumps in the number of students choosing to study abroad. The Overseas Studies program credits this to the addition of the University London College option.
Gisella de Morais, a junior majoring in international relations, decided to study abroad in Latin America this fall, choosing the region least often selected by USC students.
Although it took a few classes to grasp the language, de Morais said she wanted to study in Brazil to reconnect with her family.
“This experience completely changed me,” de Morais said. “I feel like a more complete person. Like I understand myself more, where I come from and that I have two cultures and homes in this world. “
Shane Swerdlow, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development and business administration, chose to study abroad in Barcelona, hoping, he said, to gain a better grasp of the language.
“I studied Spanish in high school, but it was weak when I arrived,” he said. “I took a two-week crash course through my abroad university, which was helpful, and my Spanish improved dramatically through forcing myself to speak in most situations. In Barcelona, most people speak Catalan before speaking Spanish, so I learned some Catalan phrases as well.”

Affectionately referred to as ’SC by its students, alumni and fans, the University of Southern California is the rightful owner of the interlocking “SC” trademark, a court announced last week, despite the University of South Carolina’s latest attempt to trademark a similar symbol.
Trojan pride · South Carolina has challenged the Trojans’ rights to the SC trademark, but Southern California continues to win out. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
When South Carolina initially came out with the interlocking “SC” logo in 2002, Southern California challenged its application to register it as a trademark. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board denied South Carolina’s logo, saying it was confusingly similar to USC’s.
In the recent counter appeal by South Carolina after the initial dispute was settled in USC’s favor, the school argued that “SC” is tied with the state of South Carolina and that the university is an agency of the state. The court, however, felt that South Carolina did not adequately demonstrate its case.
“What South Carolina tried to do is register the interlocking ‘SC’ logo for baseball helmets and merchandise related to their baseball team,” said Matthew Curran, USC’s director of Trademark Licensing & Social Responsibility. “Basically, the net result was the  [Patent and Trademark Office] came out with the ruling that the interlocking ‘SC’ was a mark that was too close to what was already registered,” said Curran.
The ruling was handed down by the federal court of appeals, which has been the most recent court to hear the case, which began in 2002. Although the ruling does not require South Carolina to immediately discontinue its use of the logo, it does give Southern California the open ability to legally challenge South Carolina’s use of the interlocking “SC” logo.
If South Carolina chooses to continue efforts to trademark the interlocking “SC” logo, the next step will be to take the case to the Supreme Court, a move that Curran said is highly unlikely.
“At this point it is a remote hypothetical,” said Curran of a continuation of the appeal process. “Our mark has held up pretty well through this process. Hypothetically, if an appeal was lost, it puts our registration to the interlocking ‘SC’ at risk, but that hasn’t happened,” Curran said.
The recent announcement of the rights to the interlocking “SC” logo looks to be a decisive victory for Southern California.
“This last judgment was pretty clear that the logo for the University of Southern California is registered for and strictly unique,” said Curran of Tuesday’s ruling.
The “SC” logo is seen daily here on the USC campus, where students can be found sporting the distinctive mark.
“I think, in terms of what it means to the school, the interlocking has a lot of national prominence for USC as opposed to South Carolina,” said John Major, a senior majoring in biological sciences. “It’s important because it’s another form of school pride.”
The confusion about the similarities in symbols between South Carolina and Southern California has been noted by many students at USC.
“I think it’s interesting that whenever you are on the East Coast, and you say ‘I go to USC,’ they always ask, ‘South Carolina?’” said Renee Edgren, a junior majoring in communication. “In the bicoastal sense, we are two different schools, but I don’t think they should have our interlocking ‘SC.’ If they were to have a similar symbol, it would confuse people even more.”
Hey, Trojans need to put their arrogance in check over this.  After all, the University of South Carolina, founded in 1801, is the original USC.
The legal question was not which school existed first, but which school registered and established their trademark first. The court of appeals doesn’t care when the University of South Carolina was founded.
Wally, that is false. The name of the school founded in 1801 was South Carolina College. The University of South Carolina system was founded in 1886, and it was only in 1906 when the current University of South Carolina got its name.

So, if you read the first installment of “Digging Up the Backissues” and thought that you might get into comics, here’s another series to help you break into the medium, and just have a good story to read.
A Parisian man is murdered while guarding an ancient secret. Soon after, his friend and unlikely detective must track down the killer, and find out why the man was murdered, getting caught up in a centuries-long conspiracy involving secret societies and the Holy Grail. 
No, I’m not talking about The DaVinci Code. I’m talking about the single best comic book of the last decade, and a story created a few years before The DaVinci Code: Rex Mundi. While Dan Brown’s novel was a lackluster, disappointing thriller that relied solely on controversy for its success, Rex Mundi was a smart, creative mystery and political thriller that used a twist on the Holy Grail myth to explore faith, dogma and Machiavellian machinations.
Created by writer Arvid Nelson and artist EricJ, Rex Mundi is the story of the Holy Grail told as a murder mystery. Set in the 1930s, it is an alternate history where magic is real and the Protestant Reformation never happened, so robed, masked Inquisitors roam the streets, hunting down heretics and acting as the law.
The series works on many levels. The mystery that drives the plot is revealed gradually, with each revelation holding impact, and actually gets wrapped up rather well. In the background, a political crisis builds until it intertwines with the mystery of the Grail. Caught up in all of it is Doctor Julien Sauniere, a sharp, driven and moody character — almost a European Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. Nelsons’ characters are fully rounded and in many ways the character drama is just as effective and compelling as the mystery.
The art is another highlight. The series goes through three artists in its run, and each artist’s style fits perfectly with the story. EricJ gives the initial story arcs a sharp, noir-style look, perfectly creating the urban feel of Paris. Jim Di Bartolo came onboard for a story set in the catacombs of the city, and his moody, atmospheric pencils only add to the suspenseful story. Juan Ferreyra finishes up the series with a softer, Art Nouvaue style as the story moves out of the city and into the sprawling countryside. Despite the different artists, the art always fits with the story, and a realism that permeates the series.
Smart, creative, and very compelling, Rex Mundi is the best comic of the decade. It takes a popular conspiracy and uses it to tell a suspenseful, genre-defying thriller that ultimately deconstructs the modern theories of the Holy Grail. Nelson and his artists have created a masterpiece for the medium, and a story that holds up among its prose cousins and rises above them.

With the U.S. job market slumping, some USC students are turning to the possibility of international careers — especially in China, with its dynamic market and booming economy.
The Zhongwen Club, in partnership with the USC Career Planning and Placement Center, is hosting an event today called “From Los Angeles to Beijing: Launching Your Career in China.” The event is a response to the growing interest in working abroad and aims to expose students to the opportunities available in the rapidly expanding Chinese job market.
“It’s getting harder to find jobs in the United States,” said Cleopatra Wise, president of the Zhongwen Club and a senior majoring in international relations and East Asian languages and cultures. “We thought having a professional event that would be open to the whole USC student body would be a good way to inform them about the opportunities in China.”
Clayton Dube, associate director of the U.S.-China Institute, said although there is no concrete data on the number of Americans who go to find jobs in China, evidence suggests the trend is on the rise.
“There’s considerable evidence that Americans, especially young Americans, are going to China to learn about China, to learn about themselves and to explore career opportunities,” Dube said.
Dube lived and worked in China in the 1980s. At the time, there was little enthusiasm among Americans for working in China, but he says interest has grown.
“One of the reasons why China is so attractive is that it is growing rapidly,” Dube said. “Many people are using this moment when there are few opportunities in the United States to try their luck in China.”
At the event, professionals with experience in a variety of fields — including economics, finance and education — will provide insight into China’s job market. They will address issues such as the cities and industries with the greatest demand for foreigners and what companies look for in American graduates.
“What we want [students] to walk away with is having a basic knowledge of what it’s like to work in China and knowing if China is a good move for them to start their careers because China honestly isn’t for everyone,” Wise said.
Hannah Watanabe-Rocco, a senior majoring in cinema, said she would consider looking for a job abroad because studying abroad in United Kingdom last fall made her want to experience other places.
“After going abroad now, I just want to see more of the world and explore more of the world,” Watanabe-Rocco said. “Another part of why I would consider going abroad is because I will take a job wherever I can get one because there are not very many opportunities here right now.”
Yewande Odetunde, a junior majoring in business administration and a participant in the Marshall School of Business’s Learning about International Commerce Program, which gives students the chance to explore the job market abroad for 10 days, said she would also consider working abroad after graduating.
She said she thinks working abroad would be beneficial to her because she is considering working for a multinational firm. Such experience, she said, would help her to better understand the cultures of customers and consequently to tailor products to them.
“Having a product that’s known around the world, you need to understand what [people’s] thought process is when using or thinking about using your product,” Odetunde said. “I want whatever career path I have to allow me the opportunity to communicate and interact internationally.”
Even with demand for foreign professionals with expertise in China, Dube said there are no guarantees for finding work. Doing well in China, he said, requires patience to learn the cultural customs and business practices, and depends on one’s willingness and flexibility to adapt to a new environment.
“China can be very challenging and it can be frustrating, but, if you are open-minded and adventurous, you will probably be able to find an opportunity,” Dube said.
The event will be in Doheny Library, Room 240 from 6-9:30PM.

Trojans fans had a lot to be excited about Saturday.
The USC women’s basketball team pulled off its fourth straight comeback win, defeating Washington State 61-51 on the road. The victory gave the Women of Troy their best start in Pac-10 play (6-1) since the 2004-05 season. 
Also, the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team opened its 2010 dual-match season with a pair of impressive wins against Loyola Marymount University and UC Santa Barbara at Marks Stadium.
And to top off the victorious day in USC sports, the men’s basketball team beat Washington 87-61 at the Galen Center, a night after blowing a 15-point second-half lead to Washington State. The team, projected to finish ninth in the Pac-10 this season, moved into a five-way tie for second place in the conference.
While the win was impressive, there was something stirring off the court that should have excited fans as well.
Amid the 6,000 fans in attendance sat new football coach Lane Kiffin and recruiting guru Ed Orgeron. Now, that might not seem very newsworthy, but joining them in the action were Kyle Prater and Markeith Ambles — two significant names in the USC football world leading up to next Wednesday’s National Signing Day.
Prater, the No. 3 overall prospect according to Rivals.com, represents a talented but small 2010 recruiting class for the USC football program. He’s rated the No. 1 wide receiver in the country and committed to the Trojans before Pete Carroll left for the NFL.
His significance lies in the fact that he decided to stay with USC when Kiffin took the helm.
In fact, he leads a group of 14 recruits who have not let Carroll’s decision to leave affect their choice to play for the Trojans. And as I’m writing this column, not one Carroll recruit has left because of  the coach’s flight for the pros.
So despite all the turmoil and worry about Carroll departing during such a crucial time in recruitment, it appears that fans can breathe a sigh of relief. Although the class is only 14 strong, it is just that — strong.
Joining Prater are two other five-star recruits, running back Dillon Baxter and wide receiver Robert Woods.
The rest of the crop is filled with talented four-star recruits, such as No. 1 tight end Xavier Grimble, No. 3 running back D.J. Morgan, No. 3 defensive tackle George Uko and No. 5 quarterback Jesse Scroggins, just to name a few.
Although Carroll was a great attraction for many players coming to USC, these commitments show that recruitment didn’t begin and end with the former coach. Kiffin and his sidekick seem to be picking up where Carroll left off.
And they might have the ability to make the 2010 class even better in the following week.
There was another very important recruit in the crowd during Saturday’s contest at the Galen Center.
Ambles, a five-star rated wide receiver from Georgia who has yet to commit to a college program, had narrowed his choices down to LSU, North Carolina, Tennessee and USC, heading into his visit to Southern California.
After his recruiting trip this past weekend, all signs are pointing toward the receiver committing to join Kiffin’s squad very soon.
If it does indeed happen, Ambles’ commitment to USC would be extremely significant for the program.
He would symbolize a sense of hope that the Kiffin-Orgeron duo can convince other big-time, uncommitted recruits to choose USC’s program by Feb. 3.
The clock is ticking, but there is still time to turn this crop into a top-10 class.
That’s why Kiffin has packed his final recruiting week with visits that potentially could make his first class at USC stronger, bigger and more reputable.
Kiffin’s busy week begins with the coach making a trip to visit No. 1 offensive lineman Seantrel Henderson in Minnesota. USC was reportedly Henderson’s first choice before Carroll left, but the question remains whether Kiffin can convince the five-star lineman that USC is still the right place for him.
Also on Kiffin’s list is No. 2 linebacker Christian Jones, a five-star recruit out of Florida, who many assumed would commit to Florida State and follow in the footsteps of his family. Jones is scheduled to take an official visit to USC this weekend and will make his decision shortly thereafter.
Reportedly joining Jones on his visit to USC is No. 13 defensive back Demar Dorsey, a Florida commit, No. 9 defensive back Nickell Robey, a Georgia commit, No. 15 defensive tackle Michael Thornton and No. 6 offensive lineman Chaz Green.
Now getting all of these players to commit to USC is highly improbable, but the point is that the opportunities to make this class better are clearly out there, and Kiffin is on a one-week mission to improve his team as much as he can.
Whether Kiffin can make it happen is still unknown.
But one thing is certain.
As exciting as Saturday was for Trojans’ fans, everything leading up to next Wednesday might be just as exhilarating.

Delayed by the rain on multiple occasions, the Women of Troy returned to the court seemingly without having missed a step.
On Monday afternoon the Women of Troy caputred a rescheduled match against UC Irvine, as strong play from both singles and doubles players allowed the Women of Troy to clinch a victory early.
Freshman Danielle Lao and sophomore Alison Ramos opened the day with a convincing win in the No. 3 doubles slot with an 8-2 victory over the Anteaters doubles pair of junior Brooke Bartlett and freshman Kristina Smith.
The Anteaters captured the second doubles match of the day at the No. 2 slot, but the Women of Troy secured the doubles point after an 8-6 victory by the team of juniors Maria Sanchez and Lyndsay Kinstler.
Straight-set victories by No. 39  Ramos, No. 37 Valeria Pulido and No. 18 Danielle Lao secured the victory for the Women of Troy.
After No. 8 Maria Sanchez’s victory over the Anteater’s Hammel at the first singles slot, the Women of Troy were well on their way to the eventual 6-1 dominating victory.
After their previous matches had been postponed because rain, getting on the court was a welcome return for the Women of Troy.
“It feels good to be out there [with the rain gone] and to be winning,” Sanchez said. “It’s also a confidence boost.”
On Sunday, No. 9 USC (2-0) bounced out to win in its first dual match of the season, knocking out a 6-1 win over the visiting No. 50 Long Beach State 49ers at USC’s Marks Stadium.
The Women of Troy opened in doubles play with two blowout wins at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, and a much closer game at the top singles slot. The Women of Troy eventually completed the sweep to give them their first team point. At the No. 2 doubles slot for USC, senior Sarah Fansler and freshman Valeria Pulido teamed up for an 8-0 triumph over LBSU’s Deborah Armstrong and Anais Dallara. Following their shutout, Lao and sophomore Ramos followed suit with another dominating doubles victory over Sarah Cantlay and Julie Luzar at 8-1.
Meanwhile, the No. 1 doubles team, comprised of Kinstler and Sanchez, had a little more trouble closing out LBSU’s No. 58 duo Jaklin Alawi and Rachel Manasse. But by the end of the set, USC outlasted the pair with a 9-8 (6) win.
Soon after, USC took five of the six singles matches as four players posted straight-set victories over the 49ers. The nation’s No. 8 player Sanchez set the tone with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Deborah Armstrong at the top singles slot. At the same time, No. 37 Pulido snagged a commanding 6-3, 6-0 win. Juniors Cristala Andrews and Kinstler posted two more singles wins at the No. 5 and 6 positions, respectively, as Andrews topped her opponent 6-4, 6-0 win in her spot and Kinstler beat Anna Jeczimionka 6-2, 6-4.
In a three-set match, USC’s     No. 39 Ramos triumphed to take the sixth singles point for her team, posting a 6-1, 2-6, 6-2 win over Alawi. Last up was Fansler, who fell 2-6, 2-6 to Dallara, giving the 49ers their only team point of the day.
The Women of Troy will be staying at home as they host the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Kick-Off Weekend starting Friday against San Diego and then will play either in the consolation or championship game against either LSU or Auburn the next day. After this weekend’s action, however, two matches in two days shouldn’t be a problem for the Women of Troy.
“These two matches gave us a little bit of momentum and confidence for our upcoming matches this weekend,” Ramos said. “They were good practice for us to compete under pressure, but it’s only getting tougher as we get further along in season.”

The No. 1 USC men’s tennis team looks to continue its strong start at Marks Tennis Stadium against the University of San Diego today at 2:30 p.m.
Teamwork · Senior Robert Farah has paired with sophomore Steve Johnson as a doubles partner early in the Trojans’ 2010 season. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
A familiar face leads the Toreros — first-year head coach Brett Masi, who was an assistant coach for the Trojans the past four seasons.
Masi was a crucial component to the national championship run last year, and the players are excited to reacquaint themselves with their former coach.
“Brett was a huge part of our team and is close to a lot of the guys, so this will push them to be at their absolute best,“ USC coach Peter Smith said.
Players feel that Masi’s familiarity with USC could give the Toreros an advantage in preparation.
“[Masi] has more insight to our game, to our play,” junior Jaak Poldma said.
USD will open its season against the Trojans (2-0, 0-0), as its first scheduled match against the University of San Francisco was postponed because of inclement weather.
The Toreros finished with a 9-14 record last season. They have five returning letter winners along with four newcomers to this year’s squad.
One of the returning stars is junior Dean Jackson, who compiled a 17-4 singles record last season. He finished the year ranked No. 34.
Along with Jackson, sophomore Nikola Bubnic has performed impressively individually so far this season.
Earlier this month, at the Collegiate Tennis Competition in Palm Springs, Calif., Bubnic beat No. 36 senior Clay Donato of University of North Carolina and lost a close match to No. 90 senior Bassam Beidas of Pepperdine 7-6, 7-6.
San Diego’s strong singles lineup and the familiarity Masi has with USC’s squad should challenge the Trojans as they continue to adjust to the dual-match season.
“We are just getting back into the team environment,” said sophomore Steve Johnson. “We need to keep working and progressing to our goal of winning the NCAA’s.”
The team is looking forward to playing on a normal schedule, but — just as last week — bad weather looks like it may be an issue again.
Rain is forecasted for Tuesday, potentially postponing the reunion of Masi and the Trojans.
If the match is able to be played as scheduled, the Trojans will surely be motivated.
“I know every guy on the team is going to be looking at being at their best to show coach Masi how good they are playing,“ Smith said.

She stands at the shoreline the cool breeze makeing its way through the spaces between her hair, lifting it slightly. The sounds of the waves crashing against the shore echo in her ears as she enters the water, surfboard in hand.
Making waves · Freshman Brendon Ballo is part of a revived USC surfing team that has gained recognition in the one semester since the team was reborn. Sponsors have been quick to support the team which has traveled to a variety of events to compete against other schools. - Photo courtesy of USC Surf Club 
Once in the water, she commands the elements as she glides on every wave, fusing with each one to ride back to the shore.
The sport of surfing has been an iconic part of California culture. Here at USC, however, that sport seems non-existent.
After a two-year absence, three USC students — junior and president of the club Mark Lathrum, sophomore and vice president Jena Sussex and sophomore and captain John Funnell — refounded the surf team at USC just this fall as a branch of the surf club.
“We’re under the surf club, but we’re a separate entity of the surf club who actually competes, does all the contests and has a roster,” Lathrum said.
The thought of a surf club at USC is a peculiar idea.
USC is known for many sports; however, a surf team seems impossible — especially considering USC’s location.
“We’re actually as close to the ocean as San Diego State, but they don’t have traffic, so they can get there in 10 minutes. We just have to work our schedule around it,” Funnell said.
The team has less structured practices in order to balance traffic with being a student and an athlete.
But to these students, this team is not just merely another sport.
“It’s an escape,” Funnell said.

For some students, the team is a gateway to reconnect with home and escape the busy, fast-paced environment of Downtown Los Angeles.
“A lot of us are beach kids, and it’s great to get out of the city and be in the ocean again,” Sussex said.
It seems the news of the team  has been spreading, bringing together those who have the same  passion.
“[We started on] day one with only three people who surf and trying to build a roster — now we have 25 people on our roster,” Lathrum said.
The team has seen a tremendous increase in interest and publicity in the short amount of time since it began the season. The popularity even reached the ears of sponsors Quicksilver and Shacked.
In addition to bringing the surfing community of the USC campus together, and reinvigorating the surfing scene in Los Angeles.
“California is known for its surf culture, and we’re just bringing that to this school,” Sussex said.
As for its first season back from hiatus, the surf team has surprised even its founders with its success.
“We’ve actually performed way better than I had expected when we started this team,” Lathrum said.
The Trojan surf team has put forth a great effort and is confident that it will reach state competition, and it even has the  aspirations to attend nationals in the National Scholastic Surfing Association.
“I’m just surprised so many people in college have such great skills in surfing,” Sussex said. “Usually surfers go pro rather than joining the college circuit. I’m glad we have them in our team.”

The No. 17 USC surf team is currently ranked near the middle of its 30-team league but is constantly improving.
“We have surfers regularly making it to second heat and third heats,” Funnell said.
The more surfers that survive each heat, the more points they can gain for their team.
Despite its recent improvement in performance, the USC surf team still strives to better itself.
“Our only obstacle is balancing surf team and school,” Funnell said. “When you have surf team, you have to basically give your whole day to it.”
While athletic and academic balance may be the Achilles’ heel for the team, the participation act to counter it.
“We have so many great surfers that can fill in for anyone — we really aren’t worried if one can’t make it to a heat,” Lathrum said.
The USC surfing team has shown that even at an urban school like USC, the beach and surf culture can still thrive. Whether it is for the sheer joy of the beach, or the competitiveness, the team has built a haven for those with a passion for surfing.
With every passing competition, the team is proving itself and setting high goals. The team ‘s ambitions show commitment to bringing surfing back to a school that seemed to have forgotten the sport existed. To Funnel, its clear what the next step is.
“We’re gonna make nationals,” Funnell said.
The surf team is so hott right now

We’re a country of immigrants. And regardless of how integrated we are with American culture, when it comes to food, there is still nothing like a meal reminiscent of that of your mother country’s. It may be something mundane, simple and cheap, but the nostalgia it evokes is priceless. Taste is important, but, when it comes to your own ethnic food, authenticity is key.
Malay fare · Banana Leaf’s rojak (top) and laska (above) lacked the intensity of true Singaporean dishes. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
As a multicultural city, Los Angeles is a great place for ethnic food. You don’t have to go far to find good Mexican, Chinese, Japanese or Korean restaurants, but, with other areas such as Southeast Asia, the hunt for cuisine gets a little harder. Thus, the disappointment of Banana Leaf, a Singaporean eatery in the corner of the Grove’s Farmers Market, was not too surprising.
Banana Leaf’s location has a touch of familiarity for Southeast Asians. Situated in the middle of a noisy, bustling outdoor food court, it is very much like the typical street markets of Singapore, which are open-air complexes with a variety of stalls selling cheap, fast food.
Banana Leaf is certainly not a fancy restaurant. It consists of one stall with a few tables and stools for open seating. The service was rude and crass — which was oddly desirable and expected in such an environment, especially since it reinforced nostalgic memories of Singapore’s own boisterous food vendors.
The restaurant’s minimal menu, however, was not so nostalgic. It sorely lacked many of the most traditional dishes of Singapore. In fact, self-proclaiming themselves as a Singaporean eatery is misleading because the majority of the dishes are actually Indonesian or Malaysian. Of course, Singapore — like the United States — is a cultural melting pot, but there are ubiquitous Singaporean dishes like char kway teow, bak kut teh and hainanese chicken rice that were all suspiciously absent from the menu.
Still undeterred in wanting a true Singaporean meal, I tried to order dishes that are prevalent in traditional hawker centers: rojak, laksa and chicken mee goreng. The rojak was nothing more than a sloppy salad of spinach, jicama, pineapple and bean sprouts in a watery sweet and sour sauce.
A true rojak resembles nothing like a healthy salad — it has no greens, but is chock-full of ground peanuts, deep-fried dough and a sweet, viscous sauce that sticks to the roof of your mouth. It is supposed to be a high-carb, high-fat, non-diet salad, but the rojak served in Banana Leaf was — in true California fashion — a healthified knockoff.
The laska, a coconut curry noodle soup, fared no better. It was watered down until it tasted like ditch water cooked with spices. It lacked the pungent, fiery, sinus-clearing kick and intensity of a true Singaporean laksa. The condiments, however, were pleasantly familiar: chewy fish cake slices and crunchy keropoks, which are deep-fried crackers made from dried shrimp.
Fortunately, the chicken mee goreng turned out to be much better than the other two dishes. Mee goreng, or “fried noodles” in Malaysian, is a spicy, fried egg noodles dish with onions, vegetables and egg. The noodles were cooked over high heat so there were bites of crunchiness, just the way a street vendor would make it. The spice level was satisfactory, and the chicken, though tough and stringy, was nicely seasoned. Was it authentic? Hard to say, as mee goreng tastes different in every stall, and every family has its own recipe, but it certainly was the most authentic out of the three dishes I ordered.
To be fair, authentic cuisine is hard to recreate in any foreign country. In the United States, more specifically, many of the necessary spices cannot be found and the intensity and flavor of dishes will inevitably be toned down to suit American palates.
Banana Leaf actually boasts high ratings on popular review sites such as Yelp.com, and business was strong even mid-afternoon. Ultimately, Banana Leaf might be a good place if you want an adventurous bite to eat but, for those seeking a nostalgic trip back to your Southeast Asian hometown, skip this place and keep looking.
It will be nearly impossible to recreate foods exactly as they are in other regions of the world. Something as simple as the poor quality of the water in some areas of the New England area makes for the best bagels. Go to Texas and try to recreate them and you can make a good product, but it will not be the same.

When the news broke in early 2003 that the Birch Hill Night Club, which sat on the border of Marlboro and Old Bridge, N.J., was sold to housing developers looking to construct an active adult community estate, teenagers in both townships, as well as the surrounding areas, swelled with hormone-driven anger. 
If you were classified as a “punk” or “freak” by your high school peers, then Birch Hill was your refuge on Friday and Saturday night. Safety pins, Etnies sneakers and thick eyeliner ruled the smoky, low-ceiling venue that was at the forefront of New Jersey’s hardcore movement during the 1980s.
But at the turn of the 21st century, fights, consistent drug use and an accidental drowning in the grounds’ dilapidated swimming pool tainted the club’s reputation.
Once a “For Sale” sign was slapped onto Birch’s aging marquee and all was said and done, Central New Jersey had lost a priceless slice of its underground hardcore heaven.
On the other side of the country, however, a similar all ages venue was just beginning to get the recognition it deserves.
* * *
In the alley running parallel to Main Street in Downtown Los Angeles, a cloth-covered office chair collides with a six-foot high metal fence, provoked by a slight, after-the-storm breeze. With this breeze also comes the pungent smell of urine, stale beer and fried food, the latter two presumably wafting from the Mexican restaurant on the corner (though from where the stench of urine originated is anyone’s guess). Other than the echoing clang of the metal fence, the alley is lifeless on a Saturday afternoon.
At night, however, the unassuming alley takes a screeching automatic external defibrillator straight to its heart.
Against the backdrop of swirling ice blue and fuschia graffiti, concertgoers ranging from high school freshmen to late 20-somethings smoke and mingle outside. A man wheeling his bike mutters, “excuse me, scenesters” as he passes through the hundred or so eclectically dressed Angelenos. Yes, the sight of these young misfits is quite the spectacle, but the Smell is hardly a part of a typified scene.
Stinky · The Smell’s main door hides behind this graffiti-covered gate during the day. The entrance lies in an alley off Main Street in Downtown. - Lauren Barbato | Daily Trojan 
Twelve years ago, after the closing of Jabberjaw and Impala Cafe — two infamously underground clubs — low-key businessman Jim Smith opened Downtown’s seminal all-ages, alcohol-free venue the Smell.
Smith’s vision was clear: rebuild a community for avant-garde musicians and music enthusiasts that were conflicted in whether they should head to the once-loved, now-dreaded Sunset Strip or the hills of Silver Lake. Since 1998, Smith has charged a mere $5 per show and recruits anyone — friends, performers and eager high schoolers — to man the club’s sole entrance and vegan snack bar.
If Silver Lake is the sanctuary for artistically minded urban professionals attempting to rid themselves of their parents’ West side lifestyle, the Smell is the alternative to the alternative Los Angeles.
The Smell, like Downtown Los Angeles, teeters the fine line between the good and the ugly and the aesthetically pleasing and undeniably gritty. Located on the fringes of the city’s feeble attempt at gentrification — posh bars and restaurants line 3rd Street, while the Walt Disney Hall looms nearby — and just a block from the ghost town of the Toy District, the Smell has literally abandoned the L.A. music scene.
Devoid of a VIP area, band members often partake in their fellow performers’ mosh pits and personally sell their own merchandise beside the club’s makeshift library. Sound technicians are nonexistent, leaving the musicians to figure out how to continue their sets with a malfunctioning mic.
Upon one’s first visit to 247 Main Street, it’s nearly impossible to fathom how this tiny venue is both churning out and reigning in the nation’s most exciting musical acts.
Or how, on day two of the club’s 12th anniversary show last Saturday night, hundreds of dedicated followers filed through the back alley to pay tribute to the movement in the making.
Yet the Smell remains largely untouched from media bigwigs, existing seemingly as a No Man’s Land for L.A.-based journalists. Save for an LA Weekly cover story, published last year, one is hard-pressed to find even a published show review when conducting a Google search. Not until recently has the Los Angeles Times — which is located less than two blocks from the Smell’s chipped facade — acknowledged the venue’s shows.
Perhaps this is because the Smell and its resident bands are not overtly concerned with performance but instead devote their onstage energy to forming an animated dialogue with the audience — a fluctuating crowd of high schoolers and 20-somethings that will dance/skank/mosh to anything as long as it’s decibel-defying. Much like the hardcore scene in Central New Jersey, ears will ring, guitar strings will snap and lyrics and melodies are optional.
For both the home-grown bands and the ones passing through, these Goodwill sweater-wearing teens are the bands’ prime customers, shelling out $10 for screen-printed T-shirts and vinyl EPs. And it’s precisely this audience that has catapulted several Smell legends — experimental noise-punk band No Age, tropical punk-rock band Abe Vigoda, electro-rock band HEALTH and the now-defunct, all-girl punk band Mika Miko — to the national stage.
For No Age, arguably the Smell’s most famous alum, its seemingly overnight success has the band worried about the venue’s credibility. As guitarist Randy Randall said last year after playing his first show in Los Angeles since the duo’s global tour, “We were in our home, but there were a bunch of strangers in it.”
But to doubt the underground that made you is to doubt your integrity, and Randall should understand that his band’s dubious homecoming is a blessing in disguise.
Although long-time fans of the noise-rock duo can become lost in the sea of new ones, No Age’s success has resulted in L.A. underground converts and handed over the musical torch to newer, aspiring bands looking to continue the Smell’s do-it-yourself aesthetic.
Unlike my beloved Birch Hill, which was an anomaly in an affluent, culture-deprived suburb, the Smell’s location in a the most schizophrenic section of Los Angeles preserves the venue’s reputation as well as the humble beginnings of its noise-rock stars.
With much of Downtown remaining in its post-apocalyptic disarray and Echo Park/Silver Lake maintaining its hipsterdom, the Smell’s authenticity appears to be safe for the time being. Although a lot can change in 31 years — as the owner of Birch Hill eventually realized — the young venue’s “yeah, whatever” attitude cuts through the current L.A. music scene as fierce as the alley’s ambiguous stench.
And as the young audiophiles weaved through the puddles and cigarette butts after the show Saturday night — some drenched in sweat and others already donning their newly purchased merchandise — it was obvious that they knew it too.

Urban Theatre Movement is a brand new company developed equally out of passion for the theatre and dedication to bettering the community.
Good grief · Urban Theatre Movement’s staging of Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead shows Peanuts characters such as Schroeder (left) and Charlie Brown (right) as young adults. The company has done many charity events throughout Los Angeles since its inception last year. - Photos courtesy of Urban Theatre Movement 
Less than a year ago, co-founders Brenda Banda and Paul Tully met at Cerritos College in Norwalk, Calif. Both were enrolled in the same acting class, and it wasn’t long before the pair became motivated by all the potential in the room.
“We started to notice how talented these young actors were,” Banda said. “It was one of those moments as an actor where I thought, ‘Wow, we could actually do something here.’”
Soon, Banda and Tully began putting on small shows with the help of their acting instructor and classmates, including a collection of scenes in Long Beach, Calif and a variety showcase in Redondo Beach, Calif. With guidance from Jeremy Aluma, the one-time director of a play Banda was in, and current marketing director of Urban Theatre Movement, the group then set its sights on doing a whole play in hopes of gathering a full company.
Both Banda and Tully grew up in inner city areas — Banda in Los Angeles and Tully in New York. The name Urban Theatre Movement reflects the company’s goal to inspire young people from similar backgrounds through the influence of theatre.
“What we want to do is introduce theatre to people who wouldn’t normally have the chance to share this passion we all have,” Tully said.
Choosing a play for the company’s first full production was a perfect example of this aspiration. Tully had been going through some plays with a friend from Compton, who knew nothing about theatre. She picked one randomly from the pile, started to read it and began laughing.
“She goes on for about 45 minutes, still cracking up,” Tully recalled. “I’m looking over at her thinking, ‘What the hell is this play?’”
The play was Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead by Burt V. Royal, a dark comedy about the Peanuts gang as teenagers.
After reading it himself, Tully was sold.
As the producing director of the company, it was Tully’s job to bring investors and secure a location for the production. Agreeing to push back the date of opening night by a month, he was able to book the Lounge 2, a newly built addition to the Lounge Theatre on Santa Monica Boulevard.
Having an extra month to prepare for the production ended up working out well for the show’s director, Mike Dias.
“It gave me more time to work with the actors, layer character development and build a powerful ensemble,” Dias said.
Having previously directed shows by absurdist playwrights, Dias found this particular play to be an important piece of theatre because it deals with heavier themes including identity crisis, drug use and death. He believed that the message of the play wastrying to reach out to young people who felt isolated and helpless, a message that Urban Theatre Movement is also adamant on getting across.
“My dream for this company is to help kids in [inner-city] neighborhoods know that there are more positive options out there for them,” said Banda, artistic director of the company. “I want them to know that there’s this thing called theatre, and it’s cool and fun and badass.”
Something else Urban Theatre Movement finds to be fun is helping the community.
On Thanksgiving Day, members went to MacArthur Park and handed out clothes, shoes and turkey sandwiches to the homeless. A few days before Christmas, they distributed phone cards and hot cocoa to labor workers outside of a Home Depot. And on Christmas Day, the group visited the New Image Emergency Homeless Shelter for the Homeless to help pass out dinners.
“I’ve always wanted to do this kind of work, but, by myself, it never happened,” Banda said. “Having a company as a vehicle for that is very cool.”
Urban Theatre Movement’s goal is to do at least one big charity event every two months, focused on helping the local community.
“We want to make a name for ourselves not just as a theater company but as a company that cares about changing what’s happening in our neighborhoods,” Tully explained.
The group also prides itself on having a strong internal community. Urban Theatre Movement currently has about 40 members and counting, many of whom are Cerritos College students or alumni. The team’s loyal support and tenacity to spread the word allowed the company to sell out the opening weekend of its inaugural production within six hours.
Already off to a promising start, Urban Theatre Movement has more plans lined up for 2010. After the run of Dog Sees God, the company is looking to put on Bertolt Brecht’s “The Elephant Calf” and further develop unique improv team Ivy League. During the spring they will be hosting a festival of one-act plays and, later, Banda will direct Life and Death in South Gate Park by Israel Lopez.
Registered as a company only three months ago, the group jumped from doing scenes in class to a full production in less than a year, an admirable accomplishment for any organization. Since neither Banda nor Tully are professionally trained in production or management, Banda says what drives Urban Theatre Movement is pure will and passion.
“It has to be done 110 percent and by that, I mean with no fear,” she said. “My whole life I’ve kind of played it safe, but I think the key is that you have to just jump in and try things because sometimes those underdog stories really do come true.”

The Tennessee coaching exodus continued Friday of this past week as defensive backs coach Willie Mack Garza left the staff of Tennessee to join the staff at USC under coach Lane Kiffin.
Garza, who coached the Volunteer secondary under Kiffin in 2009, became the fourth assistant coach to follow Kiffin from Knoxville to Los Angeles.
The 40-year-old Garza is expected to continue his responsibilities with the USC defensive backfield.  In his lone year at Tennessee, the Volunteers ranked 12th nationally in both pass defense and pass efficiency defense.
Garza brings 16 years of coaching experience to Kiffin’s staff (three more than Kiffin himself) and an extensive player’s résumé.  After earning All-American and three-time All-State honors at Refugio High School in Texas, Garza started four years at the University of Texas playing in the defensive secondary.
Garza was named a Southwest Conference Newcomer of the Year and a Freshman All-American for 1988, his first year with the Longhorns.
After his playing days ended, Garza worked as a graduate assistant with the Longhorns for three years before coaching defensive backs at Western Michigan and TCU.
Garza resigned from his position at TCU under the shadow of a DWI arrest, and joined the staff at North Dakota State, first as a defensive assistant. He then assumed the defensive coordinator position, which he held for three seasons before joining the staff at Tennessee.

Main Street has developed a strong resentment for Wall Street. And finally, through the Senate, Main Street has a chance to stick it to the man in charge of keeping Wall Street from failing.
The reconfirmation of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke, whose first four-year term expires Sunday, is in jeopardy. Though politicians might take potshots at the man who served as chairman during one of the worst economic recessions in the last few decades, it is in the country’s best interest to keep Bernanke at the helm of the Federal Reserve. His leadership is the best course to a consistent stabilization of the economy.
If at least 41 senators band together to block the confirmation vote, the country will suffer from change at the helm of the Federal Reserve, the independent government agency that is charged with maximizing employment and the value of the dollar.
Leading the charge against Bernanke has been Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), who has long criticized the chairman for ignoring warning signs of the downfall.
But while Obama entered the White House on a platform of change, there’s no reason to force a change in monetary policy. Unemployment has stabilized at about 10 percent nationally since the summer. The gross domestic product has also gone up for the second straight quarter. Economists agree that the healing process has begun. Changing the chairman could jeopardize the economy’s slow rebound.
In 2007, as lenders began to fail, Bernanke cut interest rates so borrowers could have an easier time paying back loans. A year later, he let investment bank Lehman Brothers fail because the law prevented the Fed from investing capital in a private company, especially a bank it did not have regulatory control over.
His most-criticized decision, however, was loaning more than $180 billion to insurance giant American International Group. Main Street clamored that AIG had taken terrible risks. Despite understanding this, Bernanke reasoned that AIG’s demise would have caused irreparable distress.
In the second week of October 2008, when the meltdown reached its lowest point, Bernanke cut interest rates to almost nothing. He then used emergency powers to support various loans that doubled the Fed’s expenses to $1.7 trillion.
According to TIME Magazine, the Fed’s stimulus — which was akin to printing more money — led to 3.3 million household loans, 100 million credit cards and 480,000 small-business loans. Of those, 80 percent have already been repaid.
A former professor of economics at Princeton, Bernanke’s speciality is the Great Depression. He identified the two mistakes that made the economic decline of the 1930s so severe: regulators let banks fail and also allowed money supply to decline. Come 2008, Bernanke did the opposite.
Those far removed from the Federal Reserve say Bernanke is out of touch with Main Street — but the fact is his boyhood home was foreclosed in midst of the current turmoil. He worked at a fast-food restaurant while growing up, and his family owned a pharmacy in the heart of small-town Dillon, S.C.
Nonetheless, the Obama administration must push Bernanke to support more consumer protection reforms in exchange for its support of his desire for new power to monitor “systemic risk,” as he calls it.
With Congress, Bernanke will have to continue to appease legislators’ demands for more transparency from the Fed. Already he has held more interviews and spoken more clearly than most of his predecessors, but he must be willing to accept their grievances in order to keep them from reducing the Federal Reserve’s regulatory power. He and Congress must work together to create a new set of laws that limit banks’ abilities to make poor bets and grow too large.
Bernanke mentioned an analogy in an interview with 60 Minutes that describes the situation best. A bad neighbor smoking a cigarette that sets his house on fire has made a mistake by himself. But if you don’t call the fire department, you put your house and all the other houses in the neighborhood at risk. One little spark can travel a great distance in perfect conditions. It’s best then, Bernanke argues, to put out the fire first and impose sanctions and introduce new codes and regulations later.
The fire’s out, but the smoke still hasn’t cleared in the economy. Replacing the firefighter in charge mid-operation creates great risk in maintaining safety throughout the rescue process.
When the economy is fully stable, Bernanke will raise interest rates and further stabilize banks. It may take until 2012 to get the unemployment rate back to 7 percent, but Main Street will benefit most from trusting Bernanke’s bold plan to return us to a state of economic security.

This guy has overseen the flushing of trillions of dollars of wealth down the federal toilet, and you want him to keep his job? News flash: Bernanke was the Fed chairman BEFORE the financial crisis hit, and his policy of virtually zero interest rates had a great deal to do with the reckless lending and investments that caused it and are causing it still. Yes, the disaster is still unfolding. Contrary to your absurd proposition that “economists agree that the healing process has begun”, the numbers continue to get worse — and every month, a journalist like you writes that “unexpectedly” jobless claims went up yet again. I predict a recovery to begin around November of this year.
So far bernake has dumped over 6 trillion into the dow markets just to keep them afloat…………….
And you want him to keep bankrupting america………get his rear gone back to his communisto buddies in chicago.

In the wake of a grim natural disaster that has captivated the world, a star-studded pack of celebrities have recently come together to answer the call, taking part in a huge fundraising relief effort for Haiti. 
In a two-hour telethon on Friday called Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, big names in Hollywood, such as Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Coldplay, Jay-Z and Bono, donated their talents to benefit the impoverished nation still largely devastated from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit two weeks ago.
From dial-in donations to iTunes album sales, the campaign raised a record-breaking $58 million in a single night. With the soundtrack of charity performances holding at No. 1 on iTunes in 18 countries around the world, it is expected to bring in much more over the coming days.
The celebrity spirit of giving has been just as generous outside of the widely successful telethon event as well. Pop star Britney Spears will be auctioning off costumes and props from her latest tour to benefit the cause; Shakira will have a school built for Haitian children through funds from her personal charity; and Lady Gaga will donate all the proceeds from ticket and merchandise sales at her sold-out New York City show to support recovery efforts.
Even Twilight vampire Kellan Lutz was spotted with a basket of clothes at an L.A. donation stop, while movie star heavyweights Sandra Bullock and Leonardo DiCaprio shelled out $1 million each to aid victims.

But despite the acts of kindness from the stars, is the superficial image of the entertainment industry too overwhelming for celebrities to claim legitimacy during times of social distress?
Often times, Hollywood is characterized as being a destructive scene mired in wasteful affluence, scandal, damage control and overall unimportance. Consequently, the millions of charity dollars raised and celebrities’ compelling abilities to mobilize people for positive change have been overlooked in the past. Until now.
Often slammed by the public for their lavish and frivolous escapades, “out of touch” Hollywood celebs are now more aggressively proving themselves to be significant influencers and power players within the political and social realm. In recent years, we’ve witnessed music artists and film stars play huge roles in shaping voting turnouts in elections, encouraging participation in activism and, with Haiti, raising funds for a much-needed, worthwhile cause.
The tragic situation has presented an opportunity and challenge for various faces in pop culture to assume responsibility not just as entertainers but also as very powerful role models and public figures.
If anyone is taking notice, it is not surprisingly the youth of the nation. Text donations and the explosion of relief campaigns sprawled across Twitter and Facebook are signs of a budding interest among college students and younger people — a detail that can, in part, be attributed to positive celebrity influence.
Today, younger generations are more likely to help out a good cause by seeing a trending topic on Twitter or following in the footsteps of their favorite star. Celebrity involvement and fusion of charity and social media make opportunities to help more accessible and appealing for the average young person — an obvious difficulty for everyday politicians.
Hope for Haiti Now organizer and host, actor George Clooney, envisioned stars coming together and set his hopes to reconstruct the country stronger than ever. While it’s possible that many will see such efforts as mere PR opportunities, the outcomes of these charity projects and eventual rebuilding of Haiti may serve as a lasting effect that people will see and remember.
While we’ve often scoffed as Hollywood stars lead the way in hard partying and wild antics, here is finally a good example to watch and take note of.

For USC, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a gift that keeps on giving.
The USC School for Early Childhood Education was the latest USC organization to receive stimulus funds, in the form of a two-year, $1 million grant.
Ray Hernandez, the executive director of early childhood education, told USC News that the grant will allow the school to put more resources toward pregnant teens, which is a prevalent concern in the area surrounding USC’s campus.
“We were looking to address the needs in the area, and we saw the number of teen pregnancies and teen parents,” Hernandez told USC News. “Our goal is to help these teens have a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby by develop their parenting skills.”
The grant will allow the school — which has provided preschool services to low-income families since 1970 — to expand its services to nearly 540 people and hire 12 new staff members.

Pepsi Co. is moving forward by way of reaching back with its newest gimmick, Pepsi Throwback. Until Feb. 22, Coca-Cola’s mortal enemy will be available in its original formula, a recipe containing a now unfamiliar substance called sugar.
[Note: This is not to be confused with Equal, Sweet’N Low, Splenda or any other aspartame-derived artificial sweeteners. Sugar, as your parents might remember, was once treated as a sweetener in its own right. Its popularity took a severe hit come the advent of the trend of embracing misguided health promotion tips.]
The limited edition beverage was most likely conceived in response to consumer frustration with the embarrassment of wildly complicated beverages (e.g., Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi One) saturating the soft drink market. It’s possible that the nostalgic appeal of Pepsi Throwback will make the new/old soda as successful as New Coke was unsuccessful.
I would not be the least bit surprised to learn of human rights abuses in the Pepsi Co. marketing department. Barring the use of torture chambers and threats of violence, I cannot imagine how any one company’s marketing think-tank could be so productive. The introduction of the newly retooled retro-styled soft drink comes on the heels of a complete overhaul of the beverage manufacturer’s image — a source I very much admire feels certain that the new logo accompanying Pepsi’s recent rebranding was inspired by Shepard Fairey’s iconic “HOPE” poster for the Obama presidential campaign. Never to be outdone — not even by themselves — Pepsi made the new Throwback product available on Dec. 29 of last year.
Speaking for myself, I’m quite excited by the new product. I’ll be the first to snatch it up if I see it on shelves. It captures all the appeal of azúcar-sweetened Mexican Coke with none of the sketchiness.

In the Galen Center on Saturday night, students seated in the student section could see a seemingly reinvigorated USC men’s basketball team take it to the Washington Huskies.
However, if those students turned their heads to the right, they may have also seen the pieces to the reinvigorated USC football team as well.
Recently, recommitted wide receiver recruit Kyle Prater was seated with new USC coach Lane Kiffin by his side watching the Trojans beat the Huskies by 26 points. Also near the new coach were assistant coach Ed Orgeron and recruit Markeith Ambles – whom Kiffin and Orgeron hoped would follow in Prater’s footsteps.
Ambles, who at the beginning of the recruitment season for this year’s signing class seemed a lock to suit up for the Trojans has drawn back a bit from his enthusiasm and was on campus this past weekend for a recruiting visit.
Ambles is considered among the nation’s top recruits for the wide receiver position, ranked by Rivals.com as the third receiving recruit in the nation, and 24th highest recruit among all high school players looking to sign for the upcoming season.
Ambles is also reported to be interested in other top-flight football schools, North Carolina, LSU and defending national champion Alabama among them.
Look for extended coverage of the USC recruiting trail all week on Trojan Fix, and look in tomorrow’s edition of the Daily Trojan for columnist Jon Haber’s take on Kiffin and the recruits’ appearance at the basketball game.
Trouble , trouble , trouble
Ambles didn’t lose enthusiasm for USC. Instead USC and Florida both dropped their scholarship offers, rumored to be because of off-the-field issues.
Ambles then verbally committed to Tennessee until Lane Kiffin left UT. Now it appears, Ambles will get the best of both worlds for him as he’ll get to go to USC, which had been his favorite prior to the Pete Carroll staff rescinding his scholarship offer, and he’ll get to play under Kiffin, who is a coach he really likes.
Hopefully, for Trojan fans, there won’t be any off-the-field issues for Ambles in LA.
