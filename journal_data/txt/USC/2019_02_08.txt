Many football fans, myself included, need more football, especially after Sunday’s lackluster Super Bowl. Look no further. Tomorrow, the Alliance of American Football kicks off its inaugural season. With eight teams divided between two conferences, the AAF brings professional football to seven cities without NFL teams of their own. 
The alterations to the gameplay and rules of the game are the most intriguing aspect of this new league or any new league for that matter. A new form of football needs to separate itself from existing leagues. 
Gameplay
The NFL’s rules are some of the most scrutinized aspects of the League. The AAF looks to change that, while maintaining the core aspects of the game. After touchdowns, there will be no extra point; you have to go for two. As such, kickers are almost rendered useless, as there are no kickoffs either. Somewhere, Skip Bayless is grinning from ear to ear. Wipe off that smile, Skip Nation — field goals will still be a part of the game. 
Instead of allowing everyone on the field to get CTE on a single play, the opposing team will inherit the ball on its own 25-yard line. The scoring team will have an onside kick equivalent. If a team wants to attempt to maintain possession of the ball, it will start on their own 28-yard line and will have to convert a 12-yard play on one down. 
“[The 4th and 12 play] is going to be a really exciting play,” Head of Football Operations J.K. McKay said. “We did it a couple of times in our preseason games, and it allowed a couple teams to make some pretty good comebacks at the end of the game.” 
These changes are desperately needed. Amateur football enrollment is declining every year because parents know they are essentially signing their kids’ death certificates.
According to McKay, the AAF saw no reason to try and keep a kickoff in the game.
“The NFL has changed their kickoff rules to the point where 75 percent of kickoffs are touchbacks,” McKay said. “We thought, why not just get it out. It is a health and safety concern. The onside kick is even worse than the kickoff.”
The other main change is to the way overtime works. While I would have opted for a college football-style overtime, the AAF strikes a middle ground. Each team will get a chance to score from 10 yards out. If the score is still tied after both attempts, the game will end in a tie. However,  the overtime rules will be identical to the NFL’s in the playoffs.
The AAF is committed to keeping the start-to-end time of its football games consistent. This overtime format will not only allow for that, but it also grants both teams a chance to score.
Timing 
To further shorten the games, the AAF has tweaked its system for commercials, the play clock and replays. 
Both the NFL and the AAF have four 15-minute quarters, but the AAF looks to cut down game time by cutting out TV timeouts. The average NFL game lasts 180 minutes, while the AAF is aiming for an average of 150 minutes. To make up for this revenue loss, the AAF will pursue higher commercial prices and product placement in game. Moreover, the play clock has been decreased to 35 seconds from the NFL’s 40.
Thank God. As a die-hard sports fan, I don’t mind watching more football, but that’s not what the NFL is. It’s waiting. While this 30-minute difference may seem small, it makes football games infinitely easier to digest. 
Lastly, replays can only be initiated by challenges from coaches. I really don’t know how I feel about this. On the one hand, it will prevent replays that are seemingly unimportant from stopping the game. On the other hand, if a team scores a game-winning touchdown and the opposing coach is out of challenges, there is no way to retroactively correct the call.
The first week of the 14-week season kicks off Saturday with two games, followed by another pair on Sunday. The AAF separates itself from the NFL and other startup leagues in that there is a lot to be hopeful for, not to mention that it is run by an elite staff, that includes the likes of Charlie Ebersol, executive producer of NFL Characters Unite; former USC and Steelers safety Troy Polamalu; former Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward and five-time Pro-Bowler Jared Allen, among others.
Perhaps the AAF will see the inaugural season of the next powerhouse football league. I’m surely willing to give it a chance.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team looks to continue to wreak havoc on its opponents this weekend at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla. The Trojans will begin their tournament against Pomona-Pitzer and play three subsequent games to determine their final place in the tournament.
USC has kicked off its 2019 season in  dominant fashion on both ends of the pool, outscoring opponents 140-19 in just eight games, four of which were against ranked teams. 
In contrast, Pomona-Pitzer has struggled to find a win so far this season, falling in its first two games to Azusa Pacific and Loyola Marymount. While Pomona-Pitzer had a perfect 14-0 conference record last season, it fared poorly in non-conference play, resulting in a 22-11 overall record. In their meeting last season, the Trojans defeated the Sagehens 21-3.
A win against Pomona-Pitzer would advance USC to a second game on Saturday afternoon against the winner of the Loyola Marymount-Long Beach State matchup. The Women of Troy could then compete in a semifinal match on Sunday with the aim of securing a berth in that day’s championship game.
The Trojans will need to retain their well-rounded attack in order to face potential competitors in later rounds of the tournament, including No. 6 Arizona State and No. 4 UCLA. Sixteen  Trojans contributed points to their two matches last weekend, and these players will need to bring the same offensive pressure against stiffer competition.
The team has also demonstrated its defensive depth early on this season. Senior goalie Amanda Longan, last year’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Newcomer of the Year, currently leads the MPSF conference with 12.9 saves per game. However, the Trojans’ talent in scoring is not limited to Longan. Redshirt sophomore goalie Holly Parker has played 3.5 of the Trojans’ eight games thus far, and opponents are averaging just 2 goals against her in these games.
Along with their stellar play, Longan and Parker have taken on important leadership roles in and out of the pool, which will be crucial as the competition gets tougher.
“[My goal is] obviously, to stop some shots,” Parker said. “[I also] just try to be a leader, command the defense and help to continue to improve our overall defense.”
The Trojans’ young talent has also been on display this season, with the invitational setting allowing new players to integrate themselves in the program. Freshman 2-meter Tilly Kearns has been a powerhouse scorer for the Trojans with 14 goals, the second-highest total on the team. Freshmen drivers Alejandra Aznar and Mieria Guiral also boast 13 goals apiece so far this season.
“We have a pretty young team and some new girls that have come and immediately made an impact,” Parker said. “I think [we need to] just put everything together and continue doing what we’re doing.”
Despite their early success, the Trojans look to continue improving over the course of the season, with the hope of ultimately reaching another NCAA title match. 
“We need to work on 5-on-6 defense [and] improve our center plays and half-court plays to achieve [a national title] at the end of the season,” Parker said.
The match against Pomona-Pitzer will take place Saturday. With a win, the Trojans would take on the winner of LMU-Long Beach State later the same day. The semifinal and final matches take place on Sunday, as well as the consolation matches to determine each team’s tournament finish.

Following two crucial home wins last weekend against Washington and Washington State, the USC women’s basketball team aims to build off its success when it travels to No. 17 Utah and Colorado this weekend.
Friday’s showdown against Utah may pose a challenge for the Trojans who, despite recent momentum, have struggled this season against ranked opponents. Senior forward Megan Huff, who is averaging 20.4 points per game and shooting 41.7 percent from three, leads Utah’s offense. Huff is also a defensive linchpin for the Utes, boasting 6.85 defensive rebounds per game. 
The Utes and Trojans met twice last year; USC emerged victorious on both occasions. While their 8-10 conference record last season was less than stellar, the Utes have improved to a 7-3 record in the Pac-12 so far this season.
“Utah’s a great team,” associate head coach Jason Glover said. “They’re 18-3, they’re nationally ranked, they have one of the best scorers in Huff and the altitude is tough in Salt Lake City. But we feel pretty good going in. We’ve been playing well, we’re defending well, and it should be a good game.”
To counter the offensive capabilities of Huff and the rest of the Utes, the Trojans will need to continue to shoot the ball as well as they did against Washington and Washington State. The Trojans scored 80 or more points in both of last weekend’s victories, a mark they did not reach in any previous Pac-12 games.
Redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron, junior guard Minyon Moore and senior guard Aliyah Mazyck have spearheaded the recent offensive prowess. Aaron is shooting 49 percent from the field and 47 percent from three this season and had an impressive 28-point performance against Washington. Mazyck put up 27 points against Washington State and claimed the No. 5 all-time spot for 3-pointers made. Moore’s two double-digit scoring games, including a double-double against Washington, has also helped spur the Trojans’ offensive momentum.
“Our team’s starting to come together, they’re starting to play together and enjoy one another,” Glover said. “We worked on shooting last week a lot. Earlier in the season, we were working a lot of defense, but the last two weeks we’ve shot the ball more. [The players are] in sync, in tune with each other and executing much better.”
In contrast to Utah’s success, Colorado has struggled as of late. Since the Buffaloes started Pac-12 play, they have amassed a 10-game losing streak, despite beginning the season with a strong 10-1 record. The Buffaloes are also allowing their opponents to shoot an average of 41.6 percent from the field, so the Trojans were able to capitalize on open shots Sunday. 
Despite Colorado’s unimpressive Pac-12 record, the Trojans cannot afford to be complacent even if they find their offensive rhythm early on. Several of the Trojans’ losses this season have resulted from an inability to close out games and a pattern of allowing opponents to make a come-back and win in the second half.
“Our team is looking to play a full 40 minutes together,” freshman guard Desiree Caldwell said. “I think that there are times when we look really special, but there are other times when we kind of lose focus, so focusing for the whole 40 minutes would be great for us.”
The Trojans’ challenge against Utah will take place on Friday at 6 p.m. before they travel to Colorado to face the Buffaloes at noon Sunday.

The Grammys — a night of music, celebration and culture. The original concept of the awards show intended to praise the collective profundity of many artists’ works. In recent years, this sentiment has been replaced with shock value.
Now infamous for unnecessarily extravagant celebrity appearances and anxiously delivered performances, the Grammys have devolved into one of the most stressful nights in music for artists and their audiences. For whatever reason, the show has managed to maintain its billing as representing the best in music. Each year, there are fewer logical voting decisions and more underlying social issues that reveal the corruption within the industry. 
The main issue is the inherent racism, sexism and inconsistency in the Academy’s decisions when seeing the nominees. Every few years, the Academy seems to reveal its true colors in patterns, but it undermines these later to accommodate whatever social movement reigns supreme. It haphazardly attempts to cling onto relevancy through fleeting attempts at pacifying its harshest critics. 
Take the 2014 show, for example. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Kendrick Lamar had both produced albums. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis had released the commercially successful album “The Heist.” A pop-leaning hip-hop record, the project was solid, providing both socially charged tunes (“Same Love”) and mass-appeal anthems (“Can’t Hold Us”). Macklemore had talent, but the project was by no means the best work in hip-hop that year. Yet, he still won for Best Rap Album, defeating Lamar’s “good kid, m.A.A.d. city.” 
Lamar’s major label debut was an instant classic. It intricately wove a narrative of oppression and personal strife into a society that constantly belittles and overlooks the plight of minorities in America and, in this case, Compton, Calif. Meticulously focused and expertly crafted, “good kid” was the show-stopping concept album that had something to say in an industry that continually rewarded the mindless and banal. To have “The Heist” defeat the album for a Grammy was laughable, and it perpetuated the very same source corruption outlined within “good kid.” 
So, the narrative seems established, right? The mainstream pop records always win, right? Just one year later, the same issue occurred, this time with a black woman. In the Album of the Year category, Beyoncé lost to the commercially nonexistent, albeit critically acclaimed “Morning Phase” by Beck. 
Her self-titled project was by any other measure, the album of the year. Beyoncé innovatively changed the entire way music was distributed and marketed, offering no prior promotion and featuring immaculately produced visuals for every single track. For this revolutionary project to fall to one that has already been culturally forgotten was heinous. 
The issues continued in 2015 when Lamar’s follow-up to “good kid,” “To Pimp a Butterfly,” lost Album of the Year to Taylor Swift’s “1989.” Though “1989” was an incredible project deserving of high praise, Swift’s victory inadvertently maintains the hypocrisy of the Academy and its blatant racism. This is further solidified by its curation of a Best Urban Contemporary Album to account for “urban” artists — as if Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” was not a Pop Vocal Album (Rihanna’s “Anti” and The Weeknd’s “Beauty Behind the Madness” fall into the same category).
The most egregious offense of this category is its tradition of not airing during the live presentation. The only exception is 2017’s show. Beyoncé rightfully won Best Urban Contemporary Album for “Lemonade” and was given the opportunity to give an acceptance speech. This, though, was an obvious attempt by the Academy to pacify backlash for giving Album of the Year to Adele’s “25” over “Lemonade” — again, the bigger cultural juggernaut lost. Adele herself pointed out how “Lemonade” was far more impactful as an album. 
The issues persist, but the tides never change. This year’s nominees have a decidedly minority-heavy, female-driven demographic. In major categories, women reign supreme. Janelle Monaé, H.E.R., Kacey Musgraves and Ariana Grande, among other female artists, have each earned multiple nominations. This year is another attempt to correct the Grammys’ narrative, but will it ultimately deliver? Will Janelle Monáe’s “Dirty Computer” claim Album of the Year? H.E.R. Best New Artist? Ariana Grande’s “Sweetener” Best Pop Vocal Album?
Only time will tell whether the Grammys can find the right path or if it will be too little, too late. Either way, the show should not be considered an accurate representation of the best in music. The Grammys, at least for the last decade, are a flop.

The orchestra starts playing and USC’s own Vince Mendoza is at the front, waving his hands and baton, commanding musicians to play his arrangement. As he conducts the performance, Mendoza hopes his music will illustrate a story that will resonate with the audience. 
Mendoza, an adjunct professor of jazz composition at the Thornton School of Music, is an accomplished composer who has arranged and conducted for quartets and orchestras worldwide. At the 61st Grammy Awards Sunday night, Mendoza will be among the nominees for the music industry’s most prestigious awards.
Mendoza was nominated for two of his works: “Mona Lisa,” for Best Arrangement, Instrumentals and Vocals and “If You Really Want” for Best Jazz Vocal Album. 
“The Grammy nomination is a form of recognition that, yes … we hear what you’re doing, and we want you to continue,” Mendoza said.
In his 25 years of composition, Mendoza has received five Grammy awards and 30 Grammy nominations. 
“I love being in the world of music and creating music and meeting great musicians and being inspired and inspiring people,” Mendoza said.
Mendoza’s rearrangement of “Mona Lisa,” a signature song produced by Nat King Cole in 1950, is a tribute to the composer’s 100th birthday and a testament to Cole’s efforts in breaking race barriers.
“[Cole’s] music is important both because of the beauty in the far-reaching power of his music throughout the world but also by nature of how difficult it was for an African American musician to be successful on a larger scale.” Mendoza said. 
The origins of “If You Really Want” come from Hilversum, a town in the Netherlands where Mendoza wrote and rearranged a record with Raul Midon, an American jazz and pop singer-songwriter, and the Metropole Orkest, a Dutch orchestra.
“I was the chief conductor of the Metropole for nine seasons,” Mendoza said. “We put [Raul Midon] in the middle of this orchestra and arranged his songs.”
Bob Mintzer, a professor of jazz studies at the Thornton School of Music, is a long-time friend of Mendoza.
“Everything Vince has done has huge substance due to the fact that he has such an individual voice, and he really knows music in a very broad way,” Mintzer said. “He is well-deserving to say the least.”
Mendoza’s passion for music started from a young age. 
“I came from a musical family,” Mendoza said. “My mother and her brothers all played instruments. And I think my earliest memory really of music was … that I grew up listening to the radio.”
According to Mendoza, specific genres and musical movements such as Motown Soul and the Philadelphia sound inspired his love for jazz music.
“I would listen to the radio as a child and think about what it would be like to be in the studio with Arisa, Stevie Wonder or to conduct the orchestra with Earth, Wind & Fire,” Mendoza said. 
Mendoza began playing the guitar at six years old and started playing the trumpet and arranging band music in high school. With many musical influences under his belt, Mendoza soon received the opportunity to display his passion by composing music for his high school band.
“My first experience in writing music [was] for strings and for non-jazz instruments, electric guitar and Latin percussion and flutes and clarinets,” Mendoza said. “But [my experience] really all came from my interest in listening to the radio and musing about what could be possible.”
Since then, Mendoza has traveled around the world as a guest conductor for bands and orchestras in Japan, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and the United States. He has also branched out to other styles, including classical music and jazz-pop. 
Mallory Hauser, a senior majoring in popular composition, receives individual instruction from Mendoza. She said Mendoza has pushed her limits and driven home the importance of every individual note.  
“I think he has a lot of wisdom, and he definitely brings another dimension to the idea of creating music and supporting what emotions you want to convey in the best way you can, musically speaking,” Hauser said. 
To Mendoza, being nominated and winning awards is an added bonus to the main reason he works as a composer. 
“To have your work acknowledged by an organization of your peers is a great thing for an artist to have that extra impetus to continue to do what you’re doing,” he said.

Last month, USC appointed Stacy Giwa as the vice president of ethics and compliance. This appointment came in the midst of a University-wide effort to prioritize ethical practices following several scandals that rocked the University last year — most notably, the sexual abuse allegations made against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall. 
As the leader of USC’s Office of Ethics and Compliance, Giwa is responsible for ensuring that the University complies with legal and ethical requirements and, more importantly, fosters a culture centered on the school’s core values. After months of discussion about revisiting the University’s core values, Giwa’s appointment marks a crucial step in turning those ideas into action.
Giwa’s track record shows promise for successfully accomplishing these goals. In the human resources department at Southern California Edison, she spearheaded outreach initiatives to gather employee feedback on company leadership. Her work was crucial to starting two-way communication between company leaders and employees within a large institution, a practice USC needs to adopt in order to rebuild its reputation as an ethical establishment.
Following news of the Tyndall investigation, many students developed a profound distrust of the administration, understandably so. While USC’s sweeping promise to “review its core values and recommit itself to them” is well-intentioned, students will need to see concrete actions and tangible results to bridge the gap in credibility. More importantly, they will need to see University officials take preventative steps to ensure that misconduct does not occur in the first place.
Much of this preventative action takes the form of ensuring the administration complies with the University’s ethical guidelines, which is one of Giwa’s responsibilities. According to Interim President Wanda Austin, Giwa’s roles include “leading the strategic development and execution of an integrated ethics and compliance program.” Given that last year’s scandals took place even though ethical guidelines were already well established, Giwa’s new program must go beyond outlining a set of rules for others to follow.
To succeed, new efforts must hold University officials accountable for understanding and following these standards, all while communicating with the rest of the University every step of the way. Given her history of engagement across all levels of an institution and incorporating their needs into her programs, Giwa has the expertise needed to create a more inclusive action plan that suits the needs of students and administration alike. Furthermore, she plans to create training programs that not only teach ethical decision-making, but also encourage individuals to report misconduct. This is especially crucial considering that fear of speaking out is a major reason why sexual abuse crimes, including the Tyndall case, remain buried for decades. 
In addition to practicing transparency, Giwa and the rest of the Office of Ethics and Compliance must engage with students directly, opening the channel for two-way communication surrounding these crucial issues. In light of all the scandals that have surfaced, many of which impacted students in deeply personal ways, University ethics is now a significant student concern, not just a set of policies buried at the institutional level — and Giwa seems to agree. 
“Culture doesn’t live in an office,” she told USC News. “Values and culture are something we are all responsible for.” 
She also emphasized the importance of opening up the discussion surrounding USC’s ethical practices to everyone involved, including students.
As USC continues its journey toward regaining student trust, it must move away from sweeping promises and toward concrete actions. Appointing Giwa to oversee the Office of Ethics and Compliance holds promise in beginning this process and ensuring that students are a central part of it.

The USC Center on Public Diplomacy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands wrapped up programming Thursday for Public Diplomacy Week in Brussels, an event that included a series of workshops about the impact of digital technology on the future of public diplomacy. 
The Center on Public Diplomacy has hosted these workshops for 14 years in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, but it decided to partner with the Dutch Ministry this year to allow more international participants to attend the workshop, according to Stacy Ingber, CPD’s assistant director of programming and events.
“We are hoping to capture the voices of the most forward-thinking, most technologically advanced diplomats in foreign ministries around the world,” said Lisa Rau, CPD’s editorial manager. “This is like the ‘who’s who?’ in technologically advanced diplomacy.”
The program ran Feb. 4 to 7 and started with a series of workshops hosted by the Center on Public Diplomacy on utilizing data for public diplomacy strategy and culminated in the Diplocamp, a program hosted by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that focused on the latest trends and issues in public diplomacy.
Vince Gonzales, a professor of professional practice and associate dean of student affairs at Annenberg, said the sessions were useful, as many practitioners or organizations don’t know how to spread their messages efficiently to their targeted audience.
“Where a lot of government organizations find themselves in the same boat is they may have one or two young people who work in social media, but they don’t really understand content strategies, they really don’t understand how to take their messages and get it to where the audiences are now,” Gonzales said. “You’re missing a lot of people if you’re not paying attention to where those audiences are getting information now.”
Ingber said the workshops related to current events and allowed participants to apply public diplomacy skills to issues facing real practitioners. She said the workshops included a variety of larger concepts and allowed participants to break them down into individual issues.

“Public diplomacy, while it has been around for quite some time, has changed and evolved as much of the world has changed and evolved, with disinformation, digital content, native content, ” Ingber said. “Within those big topics, you have programs that can help explain your country’s foreign policy.”
Since platforms are always evolving, Gonzales said practitioners have to constantly learn to adapt.
“You have to learn how to communicate on the new digital platforms, you have to learn how to create content for social media.,” Gonzales said. “You have to actually tailor the content to the platform, in order to reach especially younger people who you want to hear the message.”
Ingber said the Diplocamp portion of PD Week, hosted by the Dutch Ministry, allowed participants to continue their conversations about future innovation through “un-conferencing,” where participants can leave and enter discussions freely. 
“The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a very forward-looking embassy … and they’re really trying to get the pulse on what are those next steps, what are those critical competencies for public diplomacy practitioners, for scholars, for non-governmental organizations, to be thinking about for 2020 and beyond,” Ingber said. 
Nikki Burnett, a graduate student fellow at CPD, said she attended the event to learn about digital content and public diplomacy from professionals.
“An event like this kind of reinforced why I like public diplomacy and why I like studying it,” Burnett said. “The kinds of people I’ve talked to today have been from kind of different sectors, from different countries, from the private sector, from the public sector and kind of encompass a lot of different viewpoints and experiences.”

Award-winning Nigerian novelist and prominent feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was honored with the 2019 Everett M. Rogers Award for her contributions to discourses on race, gender and identity Thursday evening.
Adichie said her cultural background inspires her work in social justice and discussions about identity. 
“I’m proud of where I come from,” Adichie said. “I think having that sense of cultural grounding was useful for me. I’ve never felt the need to apologize for who I am.” 
Adichie’s award, which was presented by Annenberg’s Norman Lear Center, honors Rogers, a late Annenberg professor and renowned sociologist. The Center unanimously selected Adichie as its 12th recipient of the award, recognizing her influence on identity in mainstream dialogue.
“Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie uses stories to grow our empathy and our aspirations,” said Marty Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center. “In her fiction and in her essays, in her novels and in her talks, she weaves her insights about gender, race and identity into the narratives of human experience.” 
Adichie discussed the harmful removal of African narratives, particularly those of women, from mainstream dialogue. She encouraged inclusivity and discourse to bring together people with different experiences.  
Adichie’s “The Danger of a Single Story,” one of the most watched TED Talks of all time with over 17 million views. The talk focused on stereotypes and inspired the center to inquire how Africa is portrayed in American media. After analyzing 700,000 hours of news and entertainment last year, the Center’s findings confirmed Adichie’s argument that first-world narratives often stereotype African countries.
“Even though Africans are among the world’s most optimistic people about their future, Africa’s image in American media is, by and large, a single story of terrorism, corruption, poverty, disease, famine, war and western saviors,” Kaplan said. 
One of Adichie’s novels, “Americanah,” tells the story of a young Nigerian woman who immigrated to America to attend college. The novel was named one of The New York Times’ 10 Best Books of 2013 and is now being adapted into a television miniseries by actress, women’s rights activist and playwright Danai Gurira.
Gurira said she deeply resonated with Adichie’s novels and felt as if the stories in them were taken from her own diary.
“Chimamanda broke the African female voice into mainstream consciousness and she did it without compromising,” Gurira said. 
Adichie began her acceptance speech with an anecdote of her interaction with an unknown white man in an abandoned parking lot. She said she felt frightened by his presence and by the possibility that she could be the victim of a hate crime. According to Adichie, political disagreement should exist in democracy; fear, however, should not.
“Fear is a form of control,” Adichie said. “Fear is a tool that, without even consciously knowing, you use against yourself.” 
Adichie also spoke about the political discourse in America and encouraged students to combat the multitude of problems gripping society through activism.
“My greatest fear is that this country is sliding into ugly ordinariness,” she said. “An ordinariness that makes it difficult for all of its citizens to feel seen. All of you young people, change that, please.” 
After Adichie’s acceptance speech, she took questions from the audience.
Jordan Joyner, a graduate student studying strategic public relations, asked how young people can become more compassionate in the realm of social justice. Adichie said she wants young people to stop discounting those who have different views from them.
“Stop canceling people,” Adichie said. “It seems to me not a productive way of thinking about these things and also really not practical. We’re all flawed.” 
In response to sophomore Aiyonna White’s question about how journalists can avoid telling a single story on marginalized communities, Adichie said she believes journalists have the power to humanize these groups by depicting their nuanced experiences.
“I think [journalism is] quite difficult because you have this enormous responsibility that your work can, in fact, rob people of their dignity,” Adichie said. “But also, it can do the reverse.” 
In closing, Adichie said she wants black women, and all women by extension, to know they have power.
“You are enough,” Adichie said. “There is no need to apologize for anything. Don’t apologize for occupying space in the world. Don’t apologize for dreaming and wanting to do more. Don’t apologize for being ambitious.” 
Lola Akinlade, a freshman majoring in journalism, said she related to Adichie’s experiences of feeling marginalized.
“She offers a different perspective that is not shown in the media or talked about,” Akinlade said. “I think it’s so valuable to learn from someone like her. I think it’s really important that her story is told.”

Former Tuskegee Airman Lt. Colonel Ted Lumpkin, Jr. was celebrating his 99th birthday when he visited campus for a conversation with fellow airman and USC alumnus Jerry Hodges and two USC students Thursday. 
The event, “Blue Skies, Red Tails: Honoring the Legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen,” was co-hosted by the Tuskegee Airmen Scholarship Foundation, which has disbursed over $1.7 million through 1,300 scholarships to provide financial aid for college students, its website said. 
“Too often, the history of the Tuskegee Airmen escapes the younger generation,” said TASF executive director Edward Grice. “That’s why I jumped at the opportunity to bring these fine gentlemen to you tonight.” 
The Tuskegee Airmen, so-called for their training base in Tuskegee, Alabama, were the first African American men and women to join the then-segregated U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. According to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, the Tuskegee Airmen fought battles in North Africa and Europe during the war, and their contributions eventually led to the desegregation of the U.S. military in 1948. 
Hodges served as a base statistical control officer until 1946 and went on to receive a bachelor’s degree in accounting from USC in 1950. Lumpkin received basic and radar training at Tuskegee Army Air Field before receiving his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from USC in 1947 and 1953, respectively. 
The discussion was moderated by Sedaka Brown, a senior majoring in sociology, and Ayojide Hospidales, a sophomore majoring in political science. Hospidales, a TASF scholarship recipient, asked the two men how they feel about the “negative stigma” surrounding the military in the African American community.
“I think the military is the most democratic institution we have in our country,” Lumpkin said. “I think it helps you in civilian life … All in all I’d say it’s a good thing.” 
Hospidales also asked the airmen what advice they have for young African Americans like himself. 
“Try to do the best you can each and every day on all the efforts that you are challenged with,” Hodges said. “If you do the best that you can, you then don’t have to worry what history will say about whatever it is you have done.”
Hodges said he has come to realize the importance of respecting older people and learning from their lived experiences. Lumpkin stressed the importance of young people understanding the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen. 
“If young people will adhere to [the Tuskegee Airmen’s] goals and objectives, when their Tuskegee comes, they’re going to be able to meet the challenge,” Hodges said.  
Cathy Tomlin, whose great uncle was a Tuskegee airman, was one of the first recipients of the Tuskegee Airmen scholarship in 1981. She said this event was her first time attending an event with Tuskegee Airmen since her time at Tuskegee University. 
“It’s really been intrinsic to who I am, because I grew up with that history,” said Tomlin, a systems liaison specialist in the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry. “It’s kind of tragic that we’re losing this history, but it’s great that there are these opportunities like this event tonight.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Elections Commission voted unanimously that senatorial candidate Quinn Cunniff did not violate the Elections Code in a hearing Wednesday, according to the infraction decision. 
Angelina Stroud, a freshman majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change, filed a complaint against Cunniff Tuesday. According to the decision, Stroud claimed Cunniff’s campaign materials, which included direct references to the criminal trial involving USC alumnus O.J. Simpson, were inappropriate and offensive. Cunniff’s signs showed a picture of him trying on a black glove with the phrase, “If the glove doesn’t fit, you must commit … to voting Cunniff for Senate.”
“I first saw the poster when I was walking to class and at first I just walked by it, but then I totally did a double take,” Stroud said. “I took a photo of it and thought it was an inappropriate joke to make as a white male [portraying] a black man who is standing a murder trial.”
Stroud’s complaint alleged that Cunnif violated Article VIII in the USG Elections Code. The campaign policy states, “All campaign material shall contain no ‘fighting words,’ meaning language which (a) the speech, considered objectively, is abusive and/or insulting rather than a communication of ideas, and (b) is actually used in an abusive manner in a situation that presents an actual danger that it will cause a breach of peace.”
Stroud said that in her Thematic Option class, students and her professor discussed the content of the poster and many expressed their concerns. 
“I found [the poster] insulting, rather than a communication of ideas,” Stroud said. “I thought with that poster, it did not communicate any campaign ideas. It does not communicate what [Cunniff] would do with his senatorial position.”
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Cunniff said the complaint filed against him was an attempt to censor his campaign efforts. 
“The complaint was simply a waste of time,” Cunniff wrote. “My poster was found unanimously by USG to be in compliance with the Campaign Code. I am happy to see people so emotionally involved in the election process, but I wish that this energy was geared toward more worthwhile causes, instead of simply trying to sensor [sic] my campaign.”
Lucille Warren, a freshman majoring in political economy, said she also filed a complaint because she thought the poster came off as offensive. 
“I was incredibly bothered by the fact that for a school government election, that [the trial] would be made a  joke,” Warren said. “[The Simpson] case obviously holds significant weight for … [its] racial conflict … and what [Cunniff’s] picture represents is when O.J. was putting on the glove with the blood of two different [people] on it from being … beaten to death.”
