After coming up short of back-to-back championships last season, USC is hungry for another title. With the season opener coming up this weekend, the Trojans hope to start the season off right with a win. 
The Trojans have won seven total National Championship titles in their history, the first being in 1999 and the most recent back in 2021. 
Head Coach Marko Pintaric is entering his 22nd season with the Trojans and his fourth as head coach of the program. His attitude towards the game hasn’t changed since he began, despite coming up short last season to the Cardinal. For Pintaric, a recipe of hard work and communication is what he’ll stick with over the coming months. 
“It’s been like this since I’ve been involved at USC,” Pintaric said. “When you have a goal highly set – to win a national championship – you take that approach.” 
Pintaric was named MPSF Coach of the Year for the past two seasons. Pintaric consistently brings the Trojans to the final tournament of the season, and he believes this year should be no different. 
Last season, the Trojans had a second-place finish, losing to Stanford in the final of the NCAA tournament. Despite their No. 1 ranking and almost two-month winning streak going into the tournament, the Cardinal’s late kick into high gear forced the Trojans out of the running. 
“It’s a new story to write, and that story started last May,” Pintaric said. 
In the eight months since that game, however, the Trojans have not remained idle. 
In July of 2022, redshirt senior utility Bayley Weber and redshirt junior 2-meter Tilly Kearns represented the Trojans at the International Swimming Federation (FINA) World Championships, playing for the United States and Australia, respectively. 
Additionally, six Trojans were awarded All-American Honors after the 2022 season wrapped up. Redshirt senior driver Paige Hauschild and Kearns earned FirstTeam. Weber earned Second Team, followed by senior goalie Carolyne Stern who earned Third Team. Redshirt senior 2-meter Mireia Guiral and redshirt senior driver Grace Tehaney came away with Honorable Mentions. 
The kicker? All six of these players are returning for the 2023 season. 
“Kudos to our team captains, Paige and Tilly, they are really steering the ship in the right direction,” Pintaric said. 
Nine newcomers are making their first appearances as Trojans this season, and Pintaric said he is confident in the depth of his roster. 
“The team is working extremely hard,” Pintaric said. “Especially new players, they’re really earning the respect of their teammates.” 
Pintaric highlighted sophomore utility Fanni Muzsnay, freshman utility Morgan Netherton, freshman utility Maggie Johnson and freshman goalie Jada Ward as new players to look out for this season. 
Offensively, a few current Trojans are climbing towards breaking USC women’s water polo history as leading scorers. Hauschild leads the current player pack with 164 career goals, ranking 13th in USC’s history. Weber falls close behind at 18th with 143 goals, and Tehaney is tied for 23rd with 123 goals. 
In goal, Stern ranks on both all-time and single-season saves – 9th in career saves with 193 and 13th for most saves in single-season with 135. 
This season, the Trojans will face familiar foes like Stanford, Cal and UCLA, all of which are currently ranked in the top four, according to the Collegiate Water Polo Association’s preseason poll. USC is currently ranked No. 2. 
“[We are] very proud of what our seniors are doing this year, and again the team is playing for them and hopefully we will win a championship for them,” Pintaric said. 
USC’s first test of the season comes this weekend at the Lancer Joust tournament in Riverside. The Trojans will face Pacific University on Friday at 1:45 p.m., followed by Biola University later that day. On Saturday, USC will play Long Beach State and California Baptist University.

You probably don’t know Sophia Smith’s name yet — but you should. 
And when she wins the Golden Ball at the 2023 Women’s World Cup, you can tell all of your friends that you saw it coming.
At just 22 years old, Smith has already won an NWSL title with the Portland Thorns, she was named league MVP the same year and scored 14 goals while providing 3 assists in 18 matches. Smith didn’t shy away from the big moments, either. Just four minutes into the championship game against Kansas City Current, Smith made a darting run off the opposing centerback’s shoulder, collected the ball and rounded the keeper to score the opening and winning goal. Her celebration was as confident as the goal itself. 
The upcoming World Cup in New Zealand and Australia will be Smith’s first major tournament competing for the USWNT. Despite her lack of major tournament experience, Smith has already become a regular on the national team. In 2022, Smith scored 11 goals for the USWNT and started a team-high 17 matches. 
The combination of her achievements for club and country has earned Smith a place among the USWNT all-time greats already. She won U.S. Soccer’s Female Player of the Year award, the youngest to do so since Mia Hamm in 1994. Her 14 club goals and 11 USWNT goals in 2022 make her just the fourth American women’s player ever to score 10 or more for both the national team and her NWSL team. The three others? Sydney Leroux, Christen Press and the legendary Abby Wambach.
Smith is undoubtedly young, but she is ready to carry the burden of being the USWNT’s best player. Her 2022 season has set the stage for a 2023 World Cup-inspired breakout, where U.S. soccer fans who only tune in for World Cups will start mentioning her in the same breath as Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe. 
But what does Smith play like?
She has a pure attacking instinct that separates her from her peers. She’s a one-woman offense who can play anywhere across the forward line — at striker or on either wing. While some players suffer for their flexibility, Smith uses it to her advantage. Her ability to vary her positioning means she can trouble opposing defenders in different ways throughout a match. 
Football Reference, one of the leading soccer stats sites, places her in the 97th percentile among comparable women’s players for shot-creating actions — an offensive stat that counts passes, dribbles and fouls drawn leading to a shot. Smith has 5.12 shot-creating actions per 90 minutes played, a truly ridiculous figure. For reference, the Thorns averaged about 18 shots per match, meaning Smith created about one-fourth of her team’s total shots by herself. She’s one of the best dribblers in the world already with 2.93 completed per 90.
Among players who started 10 or more NWSL matches, Smith led the league in expected goals plus assists per 90 minutes, a stat that estimates the number of goals a player should’ve assisted and scored based on the position of their passes and shots. 
It’s already clear that Smith is a whirlwind attacker who can lead the line all by herself. At 22, it’s possible she will continue to improve. While she doesn’t necessarily resemble either player stylistically, Smith could eventually combine the goal-scoring prowess of Morgan with Rapinoe’s creativity. 
2023 will almost certainly be Rapinoe’s final World Cup and potentially Morgan’s last as well. But the U.S. has no reason to fear the old guard’s retirement. In the build-up to the 2023 World Cup, USWNT Head Coach Vlatko Andonovski would benefit from embracing the rise of the new guard, which Smith spearheads. 
Smith will likely start at right wing for the USWNT in New Zealand and Australia, with fellow young-gun attacker Mallory Swanson at left wing and Morgan through the middle. That attack will be as potent as any at the World Cup and can certainly go toe-to-toe with 2022 UEFA Women’s Euros winners England, who scored a ridiculous 22 goals in six matches at the tournament. 
The Lionesses will be a tough competition for the USWNT this summer, but with Smith leading the line, anything is possible for the U.S. If the Stars and Stripes take home the trophy, Smith will be a Golden Ball candidate without a doubt.

USC and UCLA are hitting the court again Thursday to add another chapter in the schools’ storied rivalry. Ahead of the game, Daily Trojan sports editor Stefano Fendrich had a chance to ask Daily Bruin senior staffer Jon Christon and sports editor Sam Settleman about UCLA’s season so far and what they expect for the big game.
SF: Aside from a few shaky performances, it seems [UCLA is] living up to the build as a top-10 team in the nation and Final Four potential. Would you guys say it’s fair to say that they’re living up to expectations so far?
JC: I think they had a top-10 team coming in, but there were a lot of question marks. Obviously, they had [senior guard/forward] Jaime Jaquez [Jr.] and [redshirt senior guard] Tyger Campbell coming back. But they’re losing Johnny Juzang, their leading scorer last year, and Jules Bernard and Cody Riley. That’s three out of the five starters from last year’s team. So it was a little surprising to see them in the top 10 just off the bat. Along the way, they lost to Baylor, but since then, they’ve been as good as advertised. So yeah, I think they lived up to expectations and kind of exceeded my own expectations just in the sense that they lost a lot of guys and haven’t really lost a beat.
SS: I think last year it was a lot easier to kind of set expectations, coming off that Final Four run, knowing what you were getting. This year, you lose a couple key guys, and you’re getting some freshmen that you’re depending on: two starters, [forward] Adem Bona and [guard] Amari Bailey. It was kind of tough to set expectations, and I didn’t really necessarily think that they would have been ranked as a top-10 team in the preseason. But the way they’ve been playing now, I think they’ve certainly lived up to that billing they had early in the season.
SF: What has this Mick Cronin era been so far for you guys? What kind of basketball do you guys expect to see night in and night out?
JC: Coach Mick Cronin definitely has a definite style, to say the least. Just going back to his time in Cincinnati, he was always known as a defense-first, hard-nosed, grinded-out type of coach. A lot of people wondered if that was going to follow to Los Angeles because L.A. is not known for hard-nosed stuff. But it’s followed pretty much to a tee and better than anyone could have imagined. 
They’re still playing low-scoring games, defense-first teams, but these teams now have more talent than Crnin ever had at Cincinnati, and now we’re seeing a team that’s in the top 10 right now … [They play] just a lot of games that are not fun to watch whatsoever, but UCLA pulls them out more often than not … Low-scoring, grinded-out, hard-nosed, defense-first, whatever the cliches are, that’s Mick Cronin’s UCLA team.
SS: This is exactly what Mick Cronin has been known for across his time coaching, and you know exactly what you’re getting every night, which is a defensive-minded game … Oftentimes, it’s not exactly the most fun product to watch. It’s pretty consistent in that sense … and the offense is much less creative and has kind of struggled down the stretch recently. And we saw that in the last UCLA-USC matchup.
SF: The last time these two teams played, at halftime it was looking like it was UCLA’s game to lose, and they just about did up until the very end when USC climbed all the way back. How does UCLA need to play to make sure they don’t allow USC to get back into the game like they did last time?
SS: You’d be tempted to say [UCLA] probably won’t do that again if they get in that position. But I think that’s honestly what [UCLA] has looked like for a lot of halves this season. They just go stagnant on offense and they can’t really produce consistent offense. We saw UCLA lose to Arizona this past weekend, shooting like 31% [from the field]. When you can’t make shots and you have an offense like UCLA has right now, it’s just really not going to go that well. You know what you’re getting on the defensive end, but at the end of the day, you’re going to have to have some players make shots. I think guys like [fifth-year guard] David Singleton, some of the maybe less prolific scorers … those are the guys that are going to have to step up. [You need that] to be able to maintain that offensive pressure throughout and not have a 16-point let-down in the second half like they did last game.
SF: The Pac-12 this season is as close as it ever is. If USC wins, they could be second; if they lose, they could be fourth or fifth. How important do you think this game is going to be in terms of the Pac-12 standings and how we view the Pac-12 as a whole moving forward?
JC: UCLA has built itself, not a huge cushion, but with that winning streak, they are in first place and have multiple games of margin right now … If they lose, USC is just one game behind them, and they’d split the tiebreaker … But I think by the end of the season, I think UCLA would probably still have a bit of a cushion, but if they lose this game, they don’t have the margin of error that they have right now.
SF: And to end it off, what’s your score prediction?
SS: I’m going to go 70-64 UCLA. Maybe a little higher score than we saw last time out, but again when you have a team like UCLA, you kind of know what you’re getting on a night-in and night-out basis.
JC: I’m going to go lower than that. I’ll go 64-61 UCLA is going to win. I think it’s going to be close, and if the recent history of this rivalry has told us anything, it will be low-scoring. The crowd will probably be crazy at Galen center, and I think UCLA just has a little bit more talent to get it done.

In addition to both hailing from the Los Angeles area, there will be many similarities between the No. 8 UCLA and USC basketball teams when they play each other this Thursday at Galen Center.
USC has two star veteran guards in senior Boogie Ellis, who leads the Trojans with 15.6 PPG, and fifth-year Drew Peterson, who leads USC with 6.6 RPG and 4.75 APG.
UCLA also has two star veteran guards in redshirt senior Tyger Campbell, who leads the Bruins with 4.6 APG, and senior Jaime Jaquez Jr., who leads the Bruins with 16.1 PPG and 7.2 RPG.
Both teams primarily feature a starting lineup of four guards and one forward, as well. 
“I think both teams match up with each other pretty well,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think it’ll be a very close game as it always is with UCLA.”
With all of these similarities, USC will look for a difference maker on Thursday night to get the job done against the Bruins.
Sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters could be that for the Trojans.
In the crushing 60-58 loss to the Bruins on Jan. 5, Dixon-Waters scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half to bring USC back from an 18-point halftime deficit. His jumper with 36 seconds left in the game even put the Trojans up 58-56, but the Bruins hit a 3-pointer and one free throw in the remaining time to secure the win.
“Reese has had a very good few weeks,” Enfield said. “He’s really improving as a player. We rely on him a lot, and he plays starter’s minutes every game, even though he’s coming off the bench as our sixth man.”
Freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu might also make his case to be the difference maker for the Trojans. Iwuchukwu did not play in the first game against UCLA, but he has since made his season debut, playing five minutes in USC’s game against Colorado on Jan. 12. He has now played in four games, with his best performance coming against ASU this past weekend when he scored 12 points and secured five rebounds.
“[Iwuchukwu] is starting to get the flow of our offense and he’s picking up the defensive assignments,” Enfield said. “He’s playing great.”
Enfield emphasized one individual performance would not be enough against UCLA, and the entire team would have to play well if they want to walk out of Galen Center with the win.
“We need everybody to step up,” Enfield said.
Since this is the Crosstown Showdown, the difference maker will likely not come down to a single player’s performance. Home field has truly been an advantage for the Trojans in this rivalry, as USC has won four straight against the Bruins in the Galen Center and nine straight at Galen Center overall. 
“The home court advantage means a lot,” Enfield said. “We played there two and a half weeks ago, Pauley Pavilion was sold out and I think every team appreciates a home court advantage.”
Similar to the 14,688 person crowd at the Arizona game this past weekend, this game will surely bring thousands of fans to Galen Center like this rivalry has a history of doing. USC has a young team of nine freshmen and sophomores who do not have a lot of history playing in big crowds. 
Even though this will be a home crowd for USC, leaders on the team have taken their time to mentor the young players to play in front of a raucous crowd.
“The beginning of the last UCLA game, we came out a little slow,” said Peterson in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think there were definitely a bunch of ‘freshman mistakes,’ not only for the freshman, but across the board. I think we’re going to use that; we watched a lot of film and we’ve talked a lot about the things we messed up in the last game.”
Although the players know every game is important, Peterson admitted that the first game against UCLA and this upcoming one against their rival means just a bit more for the team.
“I’d like to say it’s another game,” Peterson said. “But obviously it’s more than that with it being a rivalry, so we’re really excited and we’re going to have even more pep in our step come Thursday.”
USC faces a tall task against the No. 8 Bruins. Between now and the final buzzer on Thursday night, USC will need to find their difference maker, whether it be a player or their home court, to tip the scales against a ranked opponent.
The Trojans will take on UCLA at Genter Center Thursday at 6 p.m.

The first time I saw street art, I was 14. I marveled at its aesthetic and knew it would be the perfect way to start curating my cool, edgy persona on my Instagram. As with most things that you discover at a young age, I wasn’t quite able to conceptualize or intellectualize what I was truly looking at. Being pretentious is a learned habit, it seems. As I grew older, my affinity for street art grew in tangent with my mother’s, prompting me to think more critically about what the art I looked at represented. 
It began to click once I read the journals of Keith Haring. Despite his early death due to AIDS, the impact and imagery of his art continue to grow — his art and iconography are still seen everywhere, from city streets in Paris to Urban Outfitters graphic tees. Throughout his career, Haring’s prevailing philosophy was that art was meant for everyone. Not just those who would attend galleries and museums and their paywalls, but for any and everyone. In the 1980s, his art could be found in New York City subway stations and other public locations around the world. 
But Haring’s beliefs as an artist are not ubiquitously shared throughout the art world. Andy Warhol’s major works are estimated at a price point well beyond millions. A betrayal to his legacy, his original pieces now retail for thousands of dollars. The art market has always confused me. How do we assign value to art? Arbitrary supply and demand curves seem to lack the depth needed to analyze the inherent worth of creativity. How, then, do we differentiate high art from the rest? It seems to lie in its accessibility.
This transcends physical paintings and murals, and can particularly be seen when comparing television and films. 
In the early days of television, TV production was looked down upon as it was often cheaper and easier — notoriously referred to as a “vast wasteland.”’ However, in the past few years, with high-quality networks and companies such as Showtime, HBO and Netflix moving into production and putting more emphasis on television, the production quality has risen immensely, creating television shows that mirror films. “Stranger Things” season four spent $30 million per episode, not entirely off from the average $50 to 100 million budget of Hollywood movies. So now, it seems the only thing differentiating movies and television is accessibility. 
Television shows are often widely made available either on cable networks or streaming platforms. While the same can be said for some movies, films that come out on the big screen and straight into the Criterion closet aren’t pieces of art seemingly meant to be enjoyed by the masses. The same goes for Van Goghs and Da Vincis that hide behind glass panels and expensive museum admission. Street art and television create power through access to the arts that is not so limiting.
While many may view television, film or museum visits as a simple way to pass the time, the artistry and craft that goes into the production and creation of art are immense, in both tangible and intangible ways. Referring to people as “cultured” seemingly has a socioeconomic barrier. If someone is “more cultured,” more understanding of the complex world around us due to the art that they consume, it should be accessible to all. Art prompts us to think, and to reflect upon the world around us. We all exist in this world and are all privy to what it entails. We all deserve to enjoy a little beauty in the form of man-made creations.
As reflected in street art, there is beauty and a great equalization through art accessibility. As a society, we are losing the ability to connect with one another in neutral spaces on neutral topics. Water-cooler shows bring us together and help us relate to one another.

My 5:25 a.m. alarm woke me up, giving me only five minutes to prepare for the Oscar nominations announcement. The first category announced was Best Supporting Actress. The names were read, and when I realized that they were past the D’s in the alphabetically ordered list, I called my friend in the U.K., another avid “Triangle of Sadness” stan, and gave him the news. Dolly De Leon had been snubbed by the Academy despite her tour de force performance. 
But as the categories rolled along, disappointment swept under the surface, and one began to realize how far the Academy has come since the #OscarsSsoWhite movement of 2015-2016. Though there’s still a long way to go as reflected by there being a measly two Black acting nominees this year, it doesn’t take counting the nominations to realize the absolutely mindblowing watershed moment these nominations are for BIPOC representation on the world stage overall. Specifically Asian talent, who have notoriously never gotten their due at the Academy Awards. Yes, though De Leon was unfortunately snubbed, this is not a year where an entire continent’s Oscar eggs are placed in the basket of one contender. 
“Everything Everywhere All at Once,” a kooky indie A24 film centered around the multiverse that is the Asian immigrant experience is the nomination leader, with 11 total. If that doesn’t tell you how far the Academy has come not just in diversity of the nominees but the sheer diversity of taste, I don’t know what does. Who would have thought having a votership that increasingly reflects the multicultural and generational complexity of film lovers could pay off after all?
And yet, there is still much work to be done — Danielle Deadwyler was passed over for Best Actress for her stirring portrayal of Mamie Till-Mobley in the harrowing “Till,” while Viola Davis and “The Woman King” got zero nods. And Andrea Riseborough’s grassroots social media campaign led by A-listers such as Kate Winslet and Amy Adams, seems to have paid off. The last-minute hail mary landed her a coveted Best Actress nomination for “To Leslie,” which her peers have made clear everybody on the face of the industry (and Film Twitter) knows is a “small film with a giant heart,” potentially changing the face of traditionally studio-run awards campaigning forever. Though an underdog story in some way, it’s ultimately soured by the possible repercussions on what seemed like a tight, satisfying final five just a few weeks ago. 
Though possibly unintentional, it’s disheartening how Riseborough and Ana de Armas were both able to get in over Davis and Deadwyler, especially de Armas for a film as degrading and problematic as “Blonde.” To learn more read Arianna Garcia’s review for the Daily Trojan. “The Woman King” and “Till”, in comparison, were both far more agreeable picks, as reflected by their success with critics as well as the major precursors, with Davis not missing out on a single precursor award. Though it is definitely hard to discuss this in context of awards given the personal biases tied to voting, it’s more than suspicious how Black talent has only truly been able to win in the supporting categories — Halle Berry is still the only Black woman to win Best Actress — a pattern which inevitably continues with this slew of nominees, where Brian Tyree Henry and Angela Bassett, the only Black acting nominees, are in supporting. It’s almost as if we can’t have Asian and Black talent properly represented in the same ceremony; it continues to be either/or. 
It’s also unfortunate how after the historic winning streak of Chloé Zhao and Jane Campion in the last two years, winning Best Director for “Nomadland” and “The Power of the Dog,” respectively, we’re back to a year with zero female directors — Maria Schrader, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Sarah Polley and Chinonye Chukwu were right there.
On the bright side, what can be said that hasn’t already been said about the legend that is Michelle Yeoh, finally an Academy Award nominee — and hopeful winner. The fact that she is the first Asian woman nominated for Best Actress in the Oscars’ 95-year history is as sad as it is history-making, as it just goes to show how rare it is that Asian actors get such opportunities in Hollywood. It’s a similar story with her co-star Ke Huy Quan, who received a Best Supporting Actor nomination after decades of being shut out of opportunities in the film industry. In his Golden Globe acceptance speech, he spoke of feeling that he had “nothing more to offer” after playing “Short Round” and “Data” —  but here’s to another major ceiling being broken. Let’s just make sure it stays broken.
After a semi-surprising Critics Choice Awards win for Cate Blanchett for her performance in Todd Field’s phenomenal “Tár” which was previously reviewed in the Daily Trojan, given the organization’s love for “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” where it got 14 nominations, it was almost certain that Blanchett was the new frontrunner. Yet the Academy recognizing “EEAAO” in costume design, original score and original song, categories where it was far from expected to appear, and the fact that the entire Academy membership, regardless of branch, will vote for all the races proves that it’s still an incredibly tight race between the two veterans after all. In addition to the awaited results of the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the BAFTAs, two major precursors and historical predictors in the Best Actress race, it remains to also be seen whether Blanchett’s polarizing Critics Choice Awards speech, in which she called out the patriarchal nature of awards hurt her campaign after all, or if it’s really just “EEAAO” global domination.
On the international scene, Netflix’s “All Quiet on the Western Front” dominated, with nine nominations including Best Picture, but it was Park Chan-wook’s “Decision to Leave” that got the short end of the stick, coming home with zero nominations, which should really come as no surprise considering how many times they have snubbed the director and his films before. Ireland, though, had a phenomenal day, with nine nominations for “The Banshees of Inisherin” including Best Picture, Best Director and four acting nominations, a Best Actor nomination for Paul Mescal in “Aftersun” and an International Feature nomination for “The Quiet Girl.” And though global sensation “RRR” was not submitted by India in the International Feature category — a mind-boggling decision — it did manage to secure a spot in Original Song after all for its juggernaut musical number “Naatu Naatu” which promises an instantly iconic Oscars performance.
Another major takeaway from the nominations: the amount of first-time nominees, with a record-breaking 16 out of the 20 acting nominees never having been nominated for an Oscar before. More than anything, it’s refreshing to see new faces recognized for their work in 2022 and in cases like Michelle Yeoh, Colin Farrell and Jamie Lee Curtis, their entire careers. There was even redemption for Hong Chau’s snub for 2017’s “Downsizing.” 
Even legendary Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer nabbed his first ever nomination for producing “Top Gun: Maverick.” And though “Maverick” missed out on Best Cinematography for Claudio Miranda, where it had been sweeping in all the precursors, it made up for it with a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, taking out previous frontrunner “The Whale” — a welcome shock to say the least. Ruben Östlund also got his first well-deserved Oscar nominations for “Triangle of Sadness” in both Best Original Screenplay and the elusive Best Director category.
All in all, putting aside the initial disappointment of the criminal De Leon snub, with “Everything Everywhere All At Once” seriously in the running to win Best Picture, it’s shaping up to be an Oscar ceremony for the history books. Just make sure you’re stocked up on everything bagels and hotdogs come March 12th.

I’ve been feeling funny lately, and by that, I mean I have not been feeling funny lately. I hate homonyms. 
To rephrase: I’ve been feeling weird because I don’t think I am witty, silly, rib-tickling or any other word thesaurus.com can provide me for “funny.”
I’m not trying to say I’m the next greatest comedian. I do not have a career in comedy ahead of me — that requires a level of confidence and ego that I am sorely lacking — but I’d like to think I provide a few little chuckles here and there.  
I grew up shy — hide-behind-my-mom’s-legs, don’t-join-any-extracurriculars-because-I-don’t-know-the-people-there, avoid-my-literal-cousins shy. Unfortunately, life forces you to interact with people daily. Even more so, you must try to be liked by people. Struggling to find my way I eventually learned that being a little silly goes a long way. 
At first, my humor was not too overbearing — I was still debilitatingly shy. It’s hard to make jokes when you rarely talk. Then, humor became a crutch. And now, I fear I may just be annoying. 
Sometimes, I hear myself talk, and it’s dreadful. My mannerisms and intonation are distinctive, and I’m not so sure that is a good thing. 
For example, it was the first day of a new class. Before the professor arrived, I decided to break the silence by asking everyone’s name — which is all well and good, but once it was my turn to introduce myself, I just went on a winding spiel about my day. Nothing that happened to me warranted such a monologue. 
I got the laughs that I suppose I was aiming for … but at what cost? 
I have been trying to retrace the steps in my life to determine what has led me to this point. Maybe to give myself some closure about who I have become or maybe to warn others of what to avoid to escape my fate. 
Currently, I have two hypotheses. 
One is that I’ve stopped watching new TV and stand-up specials. I rarely watch anything in general, but when I have twenty minutes, I just turn on the same shows I’ve already seen. 
Exploring new comics and subgenres is the only way to expand one’s taste. While I will continue to watch every new interview with my favorite comedians, I need to remind myself that those favorites were once unknown to me too. I bravely took the leap — meaning I was willing to sit down for an hour to watch something that may have been lackluster — and it led to greatness.  
However, I don’t believe my repetitive viewing is at fault. I have great taste, so the jokes continue to land. Sure, I could benefit from branching out, but rewatching sitcoms or stand-ups often brings out new layers I missed on the first viewing. 
The other hypothesis, the stronger of the two, is that the comedy I am consuming is annoying. Again, I do have great taste, so it is funny. Just, consuming too much of it too fast may have had dire consequences.
I’m specifically thinking about my love of Catherine Cohen — my icon, my goddess, my everything. No description I could give of her comedy could do it justice. So, I’ll defer to her own words.
“My comedy is oops. It’s lalalooloo. It’s glamorous. It’s j’adore. It’s foot pop. It’s lalalalalalala oohoohoo,” Cohen said in an interview with Miz Cracker while wearing a gorgeous Ganni dress. “It’s also vulnerable and real and humiliating.” 
I saw the interview on TikTok. The video caused me to put down my phone and realize that my humor has literally become “lalalooloo.” It’s as if Rina Sawayama wrote “she is me and I am her” about me and my newfound bond with Cohen.
At first, my revelation was jarring. How could this be me? The mirror placed up to me displayed a nightmarish caricature of the most annoying person alive. How could anybody stand to be around me?
Then, I calmed myself, got over myself and realized that I love Catherine Cohen. That “lalalooloo” video made me laugh out loud before I went and turned it into something bigger than it needed to be. What’s so wrong with being “j’adore” and “foot pop” when that is what is real to me?
Cohen does what she wants, even if it’s ridiculous. For example, Cohen’s book “God I Feel Modern Tonight: Poems from a Gal About Town” is a collection of poems that, if a friend showed them to you, you would have to find some way to tell them to pursue a different creative avenue. But, I bought that collection. In fact, I drove to three bookstores trying to find a copy, and it was worth it; I loved every single page. Then, I had the opportunity to watch her perform some of the poems on the British panel show “8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown” while getting laughs from another one of my icons, Roisin Conaty. Cohen somehow manages to make the unbearable endearing.
While I clearly idolize — which is much too strong of a word, but I am attempting to make a point — Cohen, I understand she is not the comic for everyone. In an interview with The Guardian, Cohen even said, “look, I find myself quite annoying, too.” But I like Cohen, and that’s all that really matters. 
So, it’s time for me to get out of my head and stop overthinking every interaction I have. Obviously, this is much easier said than done, but I’ve at least come to peace with the idea of acting a certain way because that’s what I want, not what I think others want from me. 
I realize I like my trivial monologues and I will continue to share them, when the time feels right. 
Maybe someone will find me as charming as I find Cohen. Or, maybe they’ll decide I’m just as annoying as Cohen finds Cohen and I find myself. There’s really nothing I can do besides be myself and try to be kind.  
I suppose if I wanted to draw a moral for this column, it is this: be yourself, watch what you want to watch, tell the jokes you want to tell, give monologues about your day when you want to give monologues about your day. 
However, the true moral I want this column to hold is to watch Catherine Cohen … but proceed with caution.

USC Office of Religious and Spiritual Life held a candlelight vigil Wednesday night for the victims of the Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay mass shootings that occurred this past weekend. The vigil was held in the courtyard of the University Religious Center, just as another vigil was being held in Monterey Park on the same night. 
“We wanted to host this [vigil] for our students who might not have been able to make it out there,” said Varun Soni, dean of Religious and Spiritual Life at USC. 
Primarily, Soni said, the vigil was meant to be a space where students could gather and be heard amidst the past few years which have seen a rise in anti-Asian sentiment and “scapegoating for COVID.”
“The Monterey Park massacre hit very close to home for us,” Soni said. “It’s a community that’s 12 miles away and a place where over one thousand Trojans call home … These latest mass shootings have really exacerbated the feelings our students have of fear and despair. And so really what we want to do today is just bring people together just to let them know that they’re seen and they’re heard. I find that the best thing we can do during times of tragedy is just be together.” 
Multiple members of USC’s religious life gave speeches at the vigil, including Soni, Associate Deans of Religious Life Vanessa Gomez Brake and Reverend Brandon Harris, pastor at Our Savior Parish and the Caruso Catholic Center Father Richard Sunwoo and USC Hillel Executive Director Dave Cohn. 
President Carol Folt also gave a speech, thanking those assembled for coming together as a community to comfort one another. She noted the symbolism of the candles held by attendants as a metaphor for the light and kind words that people bring to each other in times of distress. 
Among other faculty speakers were two residents of Monterey Park: Katherine Chan Guevarra, a program specialist working at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Comparative Literature department and Jacob Ardron, Director of the Alpha Omega Campus Ministry. Guevarra spoke about how she had been processing her grief and shock over the last few days and how she felt having her “boring” city become spotlighted by the news media in the aftermath of the shooting. 
“There’s so much comfort in what I thought was this banality of the city,” Guevarra said. “My neighbors and I refuse to let this tragedy define us.”
Katelyn Do, a sophomore majoring in journalism, said she heard about the vigil via Instagram, where she follows many Asian clubs and social organizations at USC. She said that she attended the vigil to give herself space to feel her own emotions about the shootings after having spoken about them in classes the past few days. 
“Being a journalism student, we have been talking about this event a lot, but in the perspective of how the media has been covering it and how the media in general covers tragedies,” Do said. “Because I, myself, am Asian American, I’ve been caught up in the whirlwind of analyzing this event instead of really processing how the event is emotionally impacting me.” 
Do said that being at the vigil was “emotional” for her, and that she appreciated the ability to come together after a few days when everyone could gather their thoughts. 
“It made me think a lot more deeply about how this event has impacted me,” Do said.

As the child of Salvadoran parents, I’ve been taught to have some pride for the motherland. However, it feels artificial at times because I’ve never had the opportunity to actually visit El Salvador — leaving an empty spot inside and feeling a lack of connection to my family and roots. I have no shame in being Salvadoran, I’ve hammered the fact that I’m Salvi into the heads of my friends for so long and use a decent amount of the “caliche” or colloquial language when I speak Spanish with my family and Spanish-speaking friends. 
But I’m still left in this limbo of not knowing what the hell I feel more connected to, my American upbringing or my Salvadoran roots. While the United States has provided me with an abundance of opportunities that I’m so grateful for, it has also implanted a constant anxiety in me regarding what’s going to happen to my parents and, at times, discomfort about our situation. There is no true patriotism for either nation. 
It’s not a sentiment felt only by myself; I asked friends of a variety of ethnic backgrounds and they also felt that way. There are also articles about this all throughout the internet talking about this internal conflict. It seems every child of an immigrant feels this way but no answers exist to the dilemma. That is until I read texts by Princeton University professor Doug Massey in my SOCI-155 course during my first semester at USC, so I reached out to have a chat.
There are so many factors that come into play when trying to understand what exactly someone feels more aligned with culturally and why. A lot of it starts with your parents, as do most things.
“It depends a lot on the class status, the education of the parents and what age they entered the United States,” Massey said. “So if your parents came at older ages and started to learn English well after their teens, they’re not going to speak it very fluently compared to people who came here before their teens. And assimilation is going to be more difficult and problematic.”
The immigration process is different between those from the Eastern and Western hemisphere. Historically speaking, Mexicans who came over to the U.S. were here for temporary employment in hard labor jobs as part of programs like the Bracero program. There are also others from different nations in the West that come seeking asylum, some that simply cross the border in hopes of a better life and those fortunate enough to obtain a visa to work in the U.S. 
A large portion of people immigrating from the East come with an H-1 visa, one of the most coveted items to have as an immigrant. However, obtaining that visa is one of the hardest things to do. You have to be deemed a skilled worker whose speciality is desired, alongside a degree. This narrows it down to elite nations, excluding the working class and making it a more arduous process for those looking to come in. 
“So there’s the stereotype of the model minority. And for students who don’t want to live up to that stereotype or can’t live up to that stereotype, that becomes problematic for them. The thing to understand about Asians is they are what sociologists call hyper-selective to get into the United States,” Massey said.
Even if you fall under those categories previously mentioned, there is no guarantee you’ll obtain that visa as there is also a quota as to how many visas the U.S. can give out per year. This difficulty to enter the U.S. influences parents into putting pressure on their children to study degrees that are “worthwhile.” There’s the common joke that all immigrant parents want their kids to become lawyers or doctors — if they really want to make your childhood hell, both — but it’s influenced by the immigration process. It’s their way of letting you know that they want what’s best for you. 
Being able to attend bilingual or cultural school gets children more acclimated to the language and history compared to those who learn at home. Schooling influences what a person consumes, impacting where they align themselves in their cultural compass. When talking to Massey about languages and going back to the motherland, he talked about the struggle for second-generation immigrants to feel like they belong in the country of their parents.
“I’ve run into a lot of Mexican Americans in Mexico, Chicanos in Mexico, who are relieved to find me and talk to somebody in English because they grew up thinking they’re really Mexican and they go to Mexico and they discover they’re not really Mexican in the same way they’re Mexican in the United States, but they’re Chicanos. They’re not the same as native-born Mexicans who grew up in Mexico,” Massey said.
These sentiments aren’t exclusive. They’re also not going anywhere. As long as there is a clash of two cultures, there will be a confusion as to what someone feels more of. It’s about learning to deal with this issue and growing in a country with immense diversity. I understand that I’ll never fully consider myself to be 100% Salvadoran since I don’t have a complete cultural understanding of the nation, and I’m not completely American because of my upbringing. As long as I embrace both and not forget my roots, I suppose I’m content with my own perception of myself, a mix of both.

USC’s American Sign Language Club is working to change the University standards that do not currently accept ASL as an avenue for fulfilling students’ foreign language requirement. At present, hearing students at USC who are fluent in ASL cannot use their experience to satisfy any foreign language requirement, and the two-unit ASL course offered also does not count toward any foreign language requirement — despite the state of California recognizing ASL as a foreign language 34 years ago, and UCLA offering 16 different ASL courses for foreign language credit. 
Shelby Heiman, a junior majoring in chemistry and a member of the ASL Club’s Executive Board, said the club first began its fight for ASL recognition at USC last winter.
“We initially started this process in January when Yaya [Shi], who is hard of hearing, joined the Board,” Heiman said. “She brought to our attention how little of a deaf and hard-of-hearing community there is here at USC, and how difficult it is to find other deaf and hard-of-hearing people.” 
Shi, a senior majoring in psychology and also an e-board member, said that, in her experience, individuals who are hard of hearing often do not go looking for a community because the stigma around being hearing impaired prompts them to conceal their disability. 
“There’s some stigma around [being hard of hearing], and having an ASL program will provide more resources and inclusion,” said Shi, who agreed with Heiman that it would demonstrate that being deaf or hard of hearing “is not a bad thing.”
Brittany Comegna, a deaf first year graduate student studying law, said through an interpreter that acceptance and inclusion becomes much better for deaf students with the addition of ASL classes. Comegna said she experienced this firsthand at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
“[Rochester] has a thousand deaf and hard-of-hearing students,” Comegna said. “You can major in ASL and English interpreting; you can minor in ASL and deaf culture. It’s a great mixture of deaf people and hearing people and the attitude is just very friendly. At [USC], I feel like deaf people don’t exist. I feel like I’m alone.” 
Erik Babakhani, a deaf senior majoring in architecture, echoed a similar sentiment, saying that going to class with an interpreter is often awkward, as people are hesitant to have relaxed conversations with him. 
“[People don’t know] that they can be comfortable talking to me,” Babakhani said, adding that ASL acceptance at USC and additional ASL classes would make his experience at the University more comfortable. 
To begin the process of convincing USC to recognize ASL as fulfilling the foreign language requirement, Shi said the ASL Club reached out to faculty members. They first worked with the Office of Student Accessibility Services, who encouraged them to reach out to the Undergraduate Board of Education. This prompted the club to send the Undergraduate Board of Education a letter listing reasons why they believed ASL should fulfill the foreign language requirement.
Nicole Wong, a senior majoring in environmental engineering and an e-board member, said that the club then reached out to UCLA to learn how their own ASL program was established. The UCLA professors told the club that USC was planning to introduce a two-unit course, “Introduction to American Sign Language,” in the fall, taught by Professor Karen Ruiz, which would aim to establish the fundamentals of American sign language in students. 
Students made a significant effort to promote the ASL class, Heiman said, including encouraging ASL Club members to join, as well as making posters in the ASL class itself. At the time of publication, the class is nearly at full occupancy for the spring semester, with 17 of 23 seats taken.
ASL has an extensive history of being recognized as a foreign language. It was first recognized as such in the 1960s by William Stokoe, a linguist and professor at Gallaudet University, a private university for deaf and hard-of-hearing students in Washington, D.C. Over nine years, Stokoe observed and documented students signing at Gallaudet, and published his findings over two books in the 1960s.
“What he found was that ASL has the same linguistic characteristics as English does,” said Ruiz through an interpreter. “He was able to identify all those same parameters in English being present in ASL.”
Ruiz said that she was happy the ASL Club was pushing for recognition of the language.
“I’m willing to support them in their fight,” Ruiz said. “I am really proud of them, and I would like to support their endeavors to have ASL recognized.”
However, the logistics of getting the language recognized at USC remains an uphill battle. Emily Hodgson Anderson, the Dean of Undergraduate Education at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said, although there are plans to add onto the existing ASL curriculum, ASL does not currently meet the University’s requirements for a foreign language. 
“For a foreign language to be recognized as something that fulfills the foreign language requirement, it has to have a complementary culture and literature,” Anderson said. “While [ASL] certainly has an accompanying culture, it does not have an acceptable written literature.”
Nonetheless, Anderson said that the conversation around USC’s foreign language requirements was one she wanted to continue having in the coming years with students, colleagues, and faculty.
“I want to develop [the ASL curriculum] first to see if there’s student interest, and then talk at the same time about the existing guidelines that we have,” Anderson said.
