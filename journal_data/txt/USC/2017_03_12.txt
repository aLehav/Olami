The Trojans’ secondary took a hit on Thursday as senior safety John Plattenburg retired from football due to concussion concerns. Plattenburg is coming off a season in which he suffered two concussions: one prior to the start of the campaign and one during USC’s Rose Bowl victory in January.
The Trojans were wrapping up their second practice of the spring when head coach Clay Helton made the announcement.
“Because of medical situations, he’s chosen to just concentrate on academics and go ahead and pull away from football,” Helton said.
Plattenburg arrived at USC in 2014 and started six of USC’s final seven games during his freshman season, splitting three starts at each safety position. He built on that foundation his sophomore year, appearing in all of the Trojans’ games except one due to illness and drawing eight starts. Plattenburg grabbed two interceptions in 2015 and won USC’s Community Service Award.
He suffered his first concussion during 2016 fall camp, however, which forced him out of the Trojans’ first four games of the season. Plattenburg missed another two games working back into the safety rotation and was eventually limited to just six games (no starts) in his junior campaign, suffering another concussion in USC’s season finale against Penn State.
Going into spring practice, Plattenburg was looking to carve out a role in the safety rotation in his final Trojan season.
“Great kid; he’s done so much for us,” Helton said. “He’s a Trojan for life, absolutely love him, but he will finish out and get his degree. He has a special place in our hearts.”

On Selection Sunday, the Trojans earned one of the last spots in the NCAA Tournament. The Trojans were placed in the preliminary play-in round, facing off against Providence in Dayton, Ohio on Wednesday. 
The game will be a rematch of last season’s first-round game, which the Trojans dropped 70-69 in the final seconds in a panic during an out-of-bounds play. But the opponent is an exciting challenge for the players returning from last year’s short-lived appearance in the tournament.
“We’re all happy,” sophomore forward Chimezie Metu said. “The most important thing is just to have fun and to come out focused. The freshmen will have to learn that through experience”
The seeding comes after the Trojans’ ability to make the tourney came under scrutiny late in the season. After cruising to a 14-0 start to the season, the team seemed to be a lock for making the tournament and continuing the momentum started with last year’s season. But a four-game losing streak punctuated by a 102-70 rout at the hands of UCLA and a 83-82 stunner at Arizona State sent the team tumbling far from the rankings and into the bubble.
As the clock rolled around to 5:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, it was unclear whether the bracket revealed live on CBS would include USC at all. But head coach Andy Enfield stayed firm throughout the process — he knew his team would make it. 
“We thought we were in the tournament,” Enfield said. “We thought we did enough to deserve to be there.”
Enfield and his Trojans will 24-9 Trojans have the chance to build upon the growth they’ve made in past years in their second-straight NCAA tournament appearance.
