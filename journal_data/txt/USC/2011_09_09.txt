I was in fifth grade on September 11, 2001. I remember the principal knocking on my classroom’s door and calling my teacher into the hallway to tell her what had happened. When she came back, tears running down her face, we all knew that something was wrong. She just shook her head, sat down at her desk, and told us that we were being sent home.
When I got home, my father was waiting for me at the bus stop. This was strange; he was never home that early. Jubilant to see him, I eagerly asked why he was there. His words were simple: “The twin towers were destroyed.” I could not conceive what he meant until I got home and saw the news on television.
My mother wasn’t home. She was across the street with our neighbor and her seven- and six-year-old children. Their father worked on the 16th floor of the north tower. We didn’t find out that he was OK until five o’clock that night.

I was a junior at USC, awakened from sleep in my bed at Troy Hall by a phone call from my then-girlfriend (now wife) Becky. Last year I wrote up a lengthy blog post about my memories of that day, including an audio clip of the phone call. Here’s an excerpt:
Becky called me Tuesday morning, September 11, at 6:50 a.m. — that’s 9:50 Eastern Time, more than an hour after the first plane hit the first World Trade Center tower, 13 minutes after the Pentagon was hit, and nine minutes before the South Tower of the WTC would collapse — [and said:]
“You guys, you ALL have to wake up! Both of the towers of the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon, have just been ATTACKED by TERRORISTS! Iran has just ran terrorists into these buildings and blew them up! Well, actually, they didn’t blow them up — they ran PLANES into these buildings! Wake up! Turn on your TV! Go watch the news! Seriously! This is, like, the biggest terrorist attack in the world! Like, in the history of the United States! Wake up! Turn on TV! Go watch! Seriously!”
Why Becky, amid the fog of war that morning, blamed “Iran” for the attacks remains an enduring mystery.
…
Two girls who lived down the hall, Amy and Emily, both friends of [my roommate] Cameron’s and friendly acquaintances of mine, came down to our apartment, wanting some company as they watched the horror unfold on TV and dealt with the panicked rumors that were flying at this point. Somebody’s relative in Pennsylvania had heard from someone that there was a plane headed for L.A.; somebody else had heard the Library Tower was a target. Or maybe the Hollywood sign. Or maybe… us? Could USC be a target? I remember actually saying — not as a joke, genuinely trying to be reassuring — that surely, if the terrorists were going to attack a college in L.A., they would choose UCLA. I have no idea what my reasoning for this statement was — because UCLA is a public school? because, this being before USC football’s rise to prominence, UCLA felt more “famous” at that point in time? — but regardless, it seemed like the thing to say.
…
I only had one class on September 11, 2001. As I mentioned earlier, it was a Political Science course titled Middle East Politics, at 3:30 PM. The professor, Mideast expert Richard Dekmejian, was fielding calls all day from local and national news organizations, but to his everlasting credit, he didn’t cancel class. He could have put the media attention ahead of his undergraduate students, but instead, he showed up and gave us a hastily conceived “teach-in” on the three groups who he felt could potentially be behind the attacks: the Iraqis, the Palestinians, and Al Qaeda. At that point, of course, we really had no idea which it was. But he gave an excellent, brief lesson on all three.
…
At some point during the day, while en route to or from campus, I stopped at University Village and bought a cheap portable TV at one of the shops there. I felt an urgent need to be connected to the news at all times, so that if something else happened, I wouldn’t be stranded with only the limited information that my primitive cell phone at the time could provide.
…
As night fell, the most pronounced local effect of the attacks on L.A.’s everyday life became extremely noticeable: there were no planes in the sky. That fact may not seem terribly significant to those who have never lived in Los Angeles, but see, the L.A. sky doesn’t really have stars. Instead, it has planes. The light pollution is so bad that it’s almost impossible to see anything except airplanes in the night sky — but LAX is so busy that there are virtually always several planes overhead, in any given direction, at any given time. So the absence of planes was downright eerie.
Even more eerie was my experience walking back from Ralph’s supermarket — where I had gone in hopes of finding a copy of the L.A. Times’s “Extra” edition — late that night, under that strange, blank sky. I felt this overwhelming sense of eerie quiet, like the entire city was hunkered down. And then I had this bizarre, split-second thought that a car turning into my path — well, turning onto the side street that I was about to cross — was perhaps aiming for me. This didn’t make any sense at all, and I immediately shook it off as absurd, but the mere fact that such a thought would even cross my mind was a perfect manifestation of the fear and paranoia that I think we all experienced that day.
…
My first post-9/11 class was Constitutional Law on Wednesday the 12th, and I remember that I had a really, really hard time concentrating. The aforementioned Professor Gillman specifically announced at the start of class that he was going to do his lecture as normal, because — as he candidly acknowledged — he really didn’t know how else to process what had happened, or what else to do. It was the Rudy Giuliani approach (everyone get on with your lives, or you’re letting the terrorists win), a few days early.
Meanwhile, an impromptu memorial sprung up at Tommy Trojan, and American flags and patriotic sentiments were everywhere on campus. … I wanted to create some sort of memorial / patriotic tribute myself, so I made a “GOD BLESS AMERICA” sign, and hung it from my apartment’s front porch, along with an American flag that I bought, if memory serves, at the Noticias 32nd Street Market. The resulting display might seem a bit hokey in retrospect, but at the time, it felt almost important to do. Becky, for her part, made a sign that said “PRAY 4 NY” and placed it in her sixth-floor window.

I was in my fourth grade science class when the planes hit the buildings. I remember vividly my teacher leaving the classroom for several minutes and returning crying. We had no idea what was going on. After school, my mom told me that some people had flown planes into buildings in New York (I lived in Boston, so not far at all) and that our country was under attack. We were all very scared and we went home and watched the news all night.

I was in seventh grade when my mom woke me up and pulled me into the kitchen to watch what was happening on the TV (Torrance, Calif). I remember being very confused, like I was watching a bad movie. It didn’t really register until we were at school and my science teacher broke down after the first tower collapsed. Going to a private Lutheran school at the time … a lot a praying followed.

I was in Las Vegas and had just gotten in from a casino a few hours before and had left the television on. I woke up to the news that the first building had been hit by a plane. As I was watching the second plane could be seen flying into the second tower. The news proclaimed that we were being attacked.
Being that I was half asleep, I thought it was a show or movie. I called my friend in the next room and told him to turn on the tv and asked if this was real. We both realized the reality of the moment.
Las Vegas news came on and the Air Force based was closed for security, the airport was shut down for about two days. Hoover Dam was blocked. People were renting and literally buying cars to get out of town.
Many people believed that The Strip would be a good next target. That day if you went on The Strip it was completely empty and the casinos as well, very surreal. I had flown in so the company I was working for rented a limo from L.A., had them drive to Vegas and pick us up and take us home. A time I will always remember.

As a management consultant I was called to the Pentagon on 9/11 for an early meeting in the D ring on the south side of the building closer to the river entrance. Two wedges over from the section that was hit inside the building no indication that anything was happening until the emergency evacuation lights kicked on orders were given to evacuate and people calmly went to their designated exits. Once outside it was clear all hell was breaking lose.
Having grown up in New Jersey with a view of the World Trade Centers from my parents house this event struck home in both places and I know people who were lost in both places.
3,000 miles from USC but the Trojan families in New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Virginia all rallied to check on their own. Almost 10 years after leaving ‘SC that day and in the ones that followed I reconnected with so many Trojan friends that I hadn’t spoken to in so long. Those bonds are deep and in tragedy we see the true meaning of family.

Our class was celebrating our professor’s birthday, when he received a phone call that made us all freeze after looking at his facial expression. He asked us to stop and take a moment for Breaking News, that was the moment we all saw the first plane hit one of the towers. I have to admit, it took us a few seconds to understand that this was not a movie, a demolition or another country. It was our precious USA under attack.

When I first heard about the attacks, I was sitting in my fourth grade class in Massachusetts. The school gave us a letter saying, “Some planes have crashed. Don’t worry.” We didn’t think anything of it at the time. Then the police came to the school to escort us all home, we began to worry. I got home, and my sister sat me down in front of the TV and for the first time I saw the devastation. But, while most people were horrified by the situation, it was worse than that for us. I had friends who lost parents that day. My sister watched as the principal came into the room and pulled a kid from the classroom. Everybody knew what that meant. When we went back school that week, we didn’t actually do anything. We sat all day in the auditorium with grief counselors trying to help us out. While most people here at USC look back and think about how sad it was that so many people died that day, it’s different for me. The memories are fading for them, but not for me. I lost people that day. While I was devastated that so many people died, I was more concerned about the few faces I would never see again.

I was in my fifth grade homeroom classroom when the towers were hit. It was one of the only rooms in the school with a television and they had herded us all in like innocent sheep to watch what the teachers deemed an “historic” event. All of a sudden there were hundreds of children crowded in the room, sobbing, watching the news coverage and footage of people jumping from the buildings. I will never forget watching people jumping- their bodies limp as they flung them out the windows. I remember saying to my friends how they looked like sacks of potatoes. I also said that the paper flying from the building was pretty.
One by one the children from the school were picked up by frantic parents who somehow believed that an elementary school in the middle of nowhere  was less safe than a home in a development. My brothers and sister and I were one of very few kids who were not shepherded home.
I remember arriving on the bus and seeing my Mom and Dad at the bottom of our painfully long and steep driveway. It had turned out that my dad was just outside of new york doing business, and my mother had spent the entire day trying to find him. All transportation and communication had been ceased, so my dad rented a car and just started driving home. The fear that I saw in my mothers eyes, even for that instant, is something that I will never be able to erase from my memory. It was that same fear that haunted her every time she picked up the phone- wondering if someone we knew was inside the towers.
My aunt owns an ambulance company in Connecticut — all available units were sent to Giants Stadium. None were used.
I feel that the reality of Sept. 11 is different for the people who are from the east coast that really felt the physical shock of it. That is in no way to discredit the emotions of those not from the area but our experience with the tragedy manifested itself differently. I live in Pennsylvania, where those brave men and women of flight 93 took over the plane that crashed about an hour and a half from my home. I had neighbors that wouldn’t leave their houses for weeks. I had friends at school who had lost parents and siblings- I even knew someone whose mother had hung herself after her husband was discovered dead in the rubble.
Even more important, I remember the goosebumps and the swell of pride that I felt walking down the street, seeing a flag hang from every stoop. It reminds me of the Pledge of Allegiance- “One nation, under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.” I wish there was a way to give justice to the victims of that day.
Despite the differences we have, 9/11 showed us that we are one nation, and we can not be divided. It’s like my Dad always said: When the going gets tough, the tough get going. September 11th is not a day for politics or lobbying, but rather one to celebrate and remember those nearly 3,000 mothers, fathers, firemen, policemen, and U.S. citizens that we will not have the pleasure of walking the earth alongside. This day is for them.

Sept. 11, 2001, impacted everyone’s lives, and it drove the USC administration to refine the university’s all-hazards response and recovery plan.
As events unfolded on Sept. 11, the university activated its emergency response plan, not knowing whether Los Angeles was in danger or whether any students had been affected.
“There were rumors and speculation at the time that a plane would be coming and would be doing the same thing in L.A.,” Senior Associate Dean for Student Affairs Lynette Merriman said. “We were prepared to bring all students onto campus and shelter them as best as we could, if that’s what we needed to do.”
Part of the responsibility of the USC Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning is to examine every building on campus where students can safely find refuge, such the Lyon Center, the Davidson Conference Center and the Galen Center, Merriman said. The office also works to secure enough food and emergency supplies in case of crisis.
Merriman noted, however, that shelter and food were not her first concerns.
“My first thought was, to be honest, ‘Oh my gosh, I wonder if any of our students lost anyone. We need to see if anybody did,’” she said, describing the frightening moments in 2001, right after she saw the second plane hit the North Tower on TV.
Student Affairs sent out emails to students from the areas where the planes hit, asking if everyone’s family was safe and if the administration could help in any way. They also assigned Student Affairs administrators to talk to students in several buildings on campus, helping the USC community cope with the attacks, Merriman said.
Since Sept. 11, the university has made several changes to its emergency plan. It has created a Community Emergency Response Team program, which is composed of staff and faculty who receive extensive training on search and rescue, fire suppression, first aid, earthquake preparedness and incident command, said Steve Goldfarb, USC fire safety and emergency planning specialist.
Moreover, the university has acquired resources like emergency food supplies, water filtration capabilities, disaster medical supplies and tools, a small pumper in case of fires and hazardous materials response equipment, Goldfarb said.
After every unexpected event or emergency, the university revises its plan, always striving for improvement.
After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, for instance, Tulane University administrators came to USC to talk about the obstacles they faced during the hurricane. As a result of the visit, USC learned it was necessary to contract with an emergency company so that in the event of a disaster, the university will be quickly assisted in putting buildings back to work, Merriman said.
But the university also wants to make sure students are aware of what to do in emergency situations. Student Affairs gives presentations every summer during freshman orientation, instructing entering students and their families about USC’s emergency plan, which can also be found online, Merriman said.
In addition, USC will be offering an Emergency Preparedness Fair on Sept. 21, where there will be emergency supplies for sale, as well as information on emergency preparedness and several demonstrations for emergency situations, Goldfarb said.
Most students say they think they would know what to do in case of an emergency, but they would like to be notified about the specific procedures they should follow.
“Notification and communication are our best friends,” said Eric Burse, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism and political science.

Ten years after Sept. 11, experts are divided over the effectiveness of U.S. diplomacy since the tragic attacks.
As the anniversary of 9/11 approaches, attention is focused not only on the loss of life that occurred that day but on how the event altered U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy. On Thursday, the USC Center on Public Diplomacy at the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism hosted a panel of experts who tackled that question.
The panel featured Philip Seib, director of the CPD; Najla al-Awadhi, a former member of the United Arab Emirates Federal National Council and general manager of Dubai Media Inc.; Laurie Brand, a professor of international relations; Ernest J. Wilson III, dean of Annenberg; Jerrold Green, research professor of communication; and Geoffrey Cowan, Annenberg Family Chair in Communication Leadership.
Since Sept. 11, public diplomacy in the Middle East has become more comprehensive, but not necessarily more successful, Seib said.
“The diplomatic issues are complex,” he said. “U.S. public diplomacy in fits and starts has had a lots of good intentions, but the problems are related to policy follow-ups.”
Al-Awadhi described how the Sept. 11 attacks were perceived in the Arab world.
Awadhi explained that the Arab world was shocked and terrified in the aftermath of Sept. 11 and realized that reform was pivotal to ensure security.
“Sept. 11 for us in the Arab world created an acute realization that we have pockets of extremists and individually advocated violence,” Awadhi said. “When we realized this, we sat back and said, ‘We have to change because this poses a threat to other countries, but also our countries.’”
Awadhi noted that the extremist trends in the Middle East stem in part from the Western support of jihadist actions aimed at toppling dictators during the Cold War.
“The ideology of violence [in the Middle East] didn’t come out of a black hole,” Awadhi said. “It was a direct consequence of policies directly advocated during the Cold War and there has been no strategy on how to re-integrate these people into society and so the extremist mindset came back to haunt us.”
Awadhi advocated for U.S. foreign policy that does not just include negotiations between diplomats but conversations between Arab people.
“There is a serious need for greater diplomacy,” Awadhi said. “We want to see more of an engagement with the Arab people — they can’t be left out of the dialogue.”
Laurie Brand, a professor of international relations, agreed U.S. diplomacy needs to abandon the policies it has adhered to during the last two decades and develop new policies that focus on the interest of the working person, specifically in Egypt.
“If the U.S. is interested in truly partnering with the Middle East, we need to listen to the slogans that came out of Tahrir Square and broad sectors of the Egyptian population,” Broad said.
Tiffany Tsa, a senior majoring in archeology and geological sciences, found the panel discussion fruitful, but said she thinks civic interactions such as tourism is an undervalued solution to public diplomacy.
“I studied in Egypt last year and I was shocked how few American tourists were there compared to European tourists,” Tsa said. “I wish they discussed how cross-cultural exchange could be used like tourism.”
David Mandel, a graduate student in the master for public diplomacy program, said he liked that the panel highlighted using Sept. 11 as a stepping-stone for future U.S. public diplomacy.
“The panel emphasized the importance of using Sept. 11 as a tool to move forward, not to stay stuck in the past,” he said.
[…] Daily Trojan quoted Seib: “The diplomatic issues are complex…U.S. public diplomacy in fits and […]

Members of the USC community will gather at Bovard Auditorium on Sunday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 and to kick off a yearlong community service initiative.
Reflecting · Ifrah Sheikh, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, paints a representation of chapter nine, verse 11 of various religious texts for the “9:11” art display opening Sunday. - Jen Schultz | Daily Trojan
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, USC President C. L. Max Nikias, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni and Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi will be among the speakers at the service, which begins at noon in Bovard. The ceremony will remember those who died and be a time for reflection on the decade that has passed.
“This is an opportunity for us — members of the Trojan Family — to show our unity,” Nikias said in an email to students, faculty and staff.
Sunday’s service also marks the official start of USC’s involvement in the President’s Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge.
The challenge, announced by President Barack Obama in March, aims to bridge religious divides and build understanding while giving students a chance to contribute to their communities. The initiative asks colleges to provide plans to get students of all religions — or no religion — involved in community service for a year. USC is one of more than 300 colleges participating in the campus challenge.
“There’s a national consciousness around interfaith community services on college campuses and especially amongst your generation of college students,” Soni said.
The idea of “interfaith” is to bring together people of any and all religious backgrounds. Though the campus service challenge is being put on with the help of the Office of Religious Life, students need not be religious to participate.
“It’s about building relationships among students with different faith backgrounds, learning about each other’s traditions, respecting them and doing that through working together,” said the Rev. Jim Burklo, the associate dean of religious life.
After the service Sunday, the Office of Religious Life and the student-run Interfaith Council will pass out cards for students to write down what positive action they intend to take this year in memory of 9/11. Students will also have the opportunity to engage in interfaith dialogue and service.
Students and others are invited to visit the University Religious Center after the remembrance service for the opening of an art exhibit done by Ifrah Sheikh, a sophomore majoring in fine arts. Sheihk has painted seven pieces, all capturing chapter nine, verse 11 of various religious texts.
“There are a wide variety of ways people respond to 9/11 — hope, beauty, fear, repulsion — but I wanted to show this in the most beautiful way possible,” Sheikh said.
Sheikh, a Muslim, said 9/11 led to many false perceptions about her religion, and she hopes her exhibit promotes religious tolerance and understanding.
“All religion is holy in some way,” she said.
Sheikh and other members of the Interfaith Council believe the display will be a good way to open a dialogue about interfaith principles.
“Students will have lunch as they hear about the display on 9/11 scriptures, then we will have small group conversations among students of different religious backgrounds about what motivates them to serve in their different religious traditions,” Burklo said. “It’s a way of learning about faith.”
Students will embark on an interfaith service project, the first of the campus service challenge. Sunday, student volunteers will be packing food for A Community Place, which distributes lunches to the poor and homeless.
So far, five service events are planned for the fall and five for the spring, and the Interfaith Council has planned an ongoing effort to teach local high school students about religion. All students are invited to participate in any of the service opportunities, regardless of religious affiliations or opinions.
“USC is one of the most diverse campuses, and with that comes plenty of different religions and traditions,” said Jem Jebbia, a senior majoring in business administration, religion and Japanese and the president of the Interfaith Council. “We need to find shared values.”
The memorial service is free and open to the public, though attendees are asked to RSVP online through the USC website. Doors open at 11:15 a.m.
Sheikh’s art show, Chapter 9, Verse 11, will remain open and on display weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Sept. 30.
