On Tuesday, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Disney, and Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, in a discussion about the management of iconic media brands in the digital age and the future of magazines.
Carter is a former writer for both Time and Life magazines, the founder of Spy magazine, and has served as editor of Vanity Fair for 23 years. Iger, who was named “Tech Top Visionary” by Fortune magazine, is responsible for Disney Studios’ acquisition of Pixar Animation, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm. Annenberg Director Willow Bay introduced the speakers, while Iger led the conversation with Carter.
“We both have a lot in common, aside from our love of Vanity Fair,” Iger said. “We have both been in I guess what one would consider the traditional media business for decades. And we were remarking that in that period of time we’ve seen a considerable change in the media landscape.”
The conversation started off with a discussion of magazines’ role in the 24-hour news cycle. Carter said that Vanity Fair does not focus on timeliness in most of their content.
“The one thing I’ve learned in this business is don’t jump on a story,” Carter said. “We are sort of halfway between the first onslaught on the story and a book. If we were to jump on something now, that story would probably be in the July or August issue.”
The process of letting a story develop allows Vanity Fair to create the long-form journalism for which it is famous. He said the stories that he publishes have four components: access, narrative or story, disclosure of new information and conflict. This legacy took many years to build, and Carter argues it might become dwarfed by other media outlets had it started today.
“I wouldn’t start [Vanity Fair] today because you would never have time to build a business,” Carter said. “I don’t think you could start a magazine of this scale today and ever hope to make a profit. Technology would eat it.”
Carter said he often plays the role of motivator to his staff during the process of creating a story.
“My job as an editor is to talk to a writer and a photographer and make them think this is the most important thing they will ever do,” Carter said. “Then I have to turn around three months later and make them think that’s the most important thing they’ll ever do.”
Iger observed that through the long writing process, Carter has the ability to work closely with everything that goes into one issue of Vanity Fair.
“Your fingerprints are all over this,” Iger said. “A lot of editors don’t really create anything; they just edit. But you create.”
Iger drew a connection between Carter’s work as an editor and his own experience at Disney.
“The reason why Pixar makes animated films that are so good is because the ideas all came from the head of the director,” Iger said. “Every Pixar film that’s been made, the story itself, has been created by the director.”
The discussion concluded with a question and answer session with the audience. One student asked what advice Iger and Carter would give to a recent graduate looking for a job.
“There is a lot of value in classroom experience and practical experience,” Iger said. “I benefitted a lot from showing an interest in learning and doing at the same time.”

Wing Hay Tang, a fifth-year architecture student known for his generosity and helpful spirit, was killed in a car accident in Malibu on Sunday.  He was 22.
Known to his friends as “Vince,” Tang lost control of his vehicle on Piuma Road, driving it off of an embankment and landing overturned. Tang was pronounced dead on the scene.
Megan Kelly, a fellow architecture student and friend of Tang’s, said that Tang loved the 1988 Porsche that he drove and had restored himself.
“He loved cars,” Kelly said. “He was an avid Porsche lover; he restored his own car. He loved fishing and photography. He was a very generous person and he loved helping people … he was very personable and he was just a great person to be around.”
Kelly said she met Tang, the Northern California native, during their first year at USC and that they became close friends because of the rigorous time commitment that comes with the architecture major.
“In architecture, everyone knows each other really well because you spend many, many late nights together working in the studio,” Kelly said.
Kelly said that following the completion of his last year at USC, Tang had big aspirations for his career.
“His plan was to go work for a medium-sized architecture firm for about five to 10 years, then go open his own firm,” Kelly said.
School of Architecture Dean Qingyun Ma released a statement on Monday informing the USC architecture community about Tang’s passing.
“It is with deep sadness that I must inform you of the passing of a member of the USC Architecture Community and the Trojan Family Wing Hay ‘Vince’ Tang,” Ma wrote in the statement.  “He was a talented designer with a generous spirit, known for his love of helping others.”
In the statement, Ma also announced an event that will be held Wednesday afternoon to provide information and support. The meeting is aimed toward fifth-year architecture students but everyone is welcome.
“We hope to know more soon regarding the Tang Family’s wishes for arrangements to celebrate Vince’s life,” Ma wrote in the statement. “Please join me in keeping the Tang Family in our thoughts and prayers.”

Honors House, a residential hall located on Severance Street, will be converted into a child-care facility for the children of USC faculty.
The spring 2015 semester will be the last semester that Honors House will function as a residential hall. It has not yet been announced when the renovations will begin.
Honors House will be home to its last group of students this semester. It is set to be converted into a child-care facility, though there is not timeline for renovations yet. – Samhita Swamy | Daily Trojan
Dr. Ainsley Carry, vice provost for Student Affairs, said there is great need for a new facility.
“We offer students and faculty child care services and when new faculty move in to such a big city like Los Angeles, we want to help ease the transition,” Carry said. “The waiting list consists of more than 250 faculty looking into using child-care services. Usually, the waiting list is so long that by the time they can enroll their children, [their children] are already too old.”
Carry also said that given the location of Honors House location, it was the best option.
“It was easy to renovate, and the space met code requirements,” Carry said.
Currently, USC offers faculty and students with child care services at the UPC Child Development Center located on Severance Street. Dr. James Moore, the vice dean for academic programs at the Viterbi School of Engineering, has been part of the residential faculty program for 20 years and has lived at Honors House since 1995.
In mid-January, Moore was told about the university’s initiative to convert the residence hall into a child-care facility.
“I am not critical of this decision because I understand it, but it is still very emotional,” Moore said.
Upon hearing the decision, Moore was concerned for his students and wondered whether they would be able to find housing given the short notice. He said that the university accommodated the students very well.
“The university went out of [its] way to provide them with options,” Moore said.
Moore described his experience in Honors House as extremely enriching.
“Living with undergraduates has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my intellectual, personal and academic life,” Moore said.
Honors House was established as a residential hall in 1987 when the university began an initiative to make the housing in the area more similar to that of a residential college. The house was built to accommodate 34 residents and was originally open only to juniors and seniors. It was intended for students that had lived in the deans’ dorms as freshmen and wished to continue living together as upperclassmen.
Today, residents of Honors House do not necessarily have to be upperclassmen. The only requirement is an application stating why the student wishes to live there, though an interest in academics is a quality taken strongly into consideration.
Lauren Henry, a junior studying geology and a resident of Honors House, explained that she doesn’t understand the timing of the decision.
“I was surprised by the decision because they just renovated Honors House in 2013,” she said.
Alexia Gutiérrez, a junior studying civil engineering, said that the university had accomodated the students very well.
“When we were filling out our housing options for next year, we were given priority,” Gutierrez said.
Over the years, Moore has created a tight-knit community by hosting pizza nights, going on dinner outings and being there for the students whenever they needed advice. He described the affection he has developed for his students.
“Once you open your heart to students, you easily begin to love them the same way their parents love them,” Moore said. “You worry about them. You want them to succeed and you want the best for them.”
“Intellectually, I understand the rationale. It makes perfect business sense to me. It’s still sad to me that Honors House is coming to an end,” Moore said.

After splitting with the defending Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference champions, the men’s volleyball team will hit the road today to take on UC Santa Barbara.
The No. 3 Trojans (9-2, 8-2 MPSF) began last weekend with a gutty five-set win over BYU, but then fell to the Cougars the following day in four sets. The No. 5 Cougars (9-3, 8-2) came into the matchup tied for first place in the MPSF standings with USC. Though BYU has the head-to-head set advantage, the Trojans and the Cougars remain tied atop the standings. No. 4 UC Irvine (13-3, 8-2)  is also tied at the top of the conference standings, though USC defeated the Anteaters in five sets earlier this season.
On Thursday, Feb. 12, the Trojans beat BYU by a score of 20-25, 21-25, 25-16, 25-23, 16-14. Junior outside hitter Alex Slaught led the team with 24 kills with freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta adding 15 kills off the bench.
It was the third match in a row to go five sets for the Trojans, with both of the Trojans’ matches against Hawai’i going the maximum. The Trojans split the two matches against Hawai’i, with both going to five sets and both fifth sets requiring more than 15 points to win. The Trojans have won four matches this year in five sets, but this was the first time the Trojans had come back to win the last three sets.
On Friday, the Trojans were unable to find the same magic for a comeback, losing 25-20, 25-19, 23-25, 25-19. Though it looked like the Trojans had a chance for another crazy five-set comeback after the third set, they ultimately dropped their first match of the season at home.
Slaught led the team again in kills with 19. Senior setter Micah Christenson led the team with eight digs. After serving for 11 service aces the night before, the Trojans only recorded two in the loss.
Last year, the Cougars were regular season and postseason champions of the MPSF. The Trojans finished eighth in the MPSF during the regular season and were then knocked out by the  one-seeded Cougars in the first round of the MPSF tournament. BYU went on to win the tournament to claim an automatic spot in the NCAA national championship tournament.
After the defeat, coach Bill Ferguson said the Cougars’ blocking game proved to be the difference, adding that BYU served very well, and the Trojans did not pass as well.
“They were just great blocking the ball and we weren’t passing as crisply,” he said. “Against their block, you have to be in a system to generate some offense and we just couldn’t do it tonight.”
Ferguson said the match was the end of long stretch given the long distance traveling to Hawaii and the back-to-back games against BYU.
“They fought,” he said. “They never gave up. I’m proud of them for that, but [with] the last two weeks, we’re pretty exhausted after these last three in a row. We have to get a little rest, hit the video room and get better.”
No. 8 UC Santa Barbara (8-5, 4-5) sits in seventh place out of 12 teams in the MPSF. The Gauchos have also split with BYU, but dropped both matches at Hawaii. The Gauchos have also fallen to Cal State Northridge and Pepperdine — both of whom the Trojans defeated — but have beaten UCLA, Long Beach State and Stanford.
Ferguson said the key for the team going into Santa Barbara was to do better at reading when to send blockers to the front of the net instead of keeping players in the back court to pass.
“Working off of it, we’ve got to block a little bit better from a read situation,” he sad. “We’re pretty good when we throw commits in there. It’s the equivalent of like football and blitzing; you can blitz all the time but something’s going to be wide open if you do that. That will be something that we have got to do a little bit better against Santa Barbara.”
The Trojans take on the Gauchos at 7 p.m. tonight.

The mercy rule is one of the great policy innovations in American history. Up there with the likes of the 13th Amendment and the Interstate Highway Act, the mercy rule has defined what it means to be a citizen of this country by preventing Little League baseball games from going on way too long.
Unfortunately, the rule could not make it to the NCAA in time for this weekend’s home opener for the USC baseball team against Towson. It could have made a lot of peoples lives a lot easier and everybody’s weekend a little bit better had it been in place.
As a baseball fan, I’m always conflicted when my favorite team is winning an absolute blowout. It’s always great to see a big rally or have your team bat through the line up in one half inning. But even for my beloved St. Louis Cardinals, I start to become a little impatient when the lead gets past about six runs. I have to draw a fine line somewhere between, “Wow, this is such a fun game to watch!” and, “Wow, I’m ready to get this thing over with,” and I start to secretly hope for my favorite players to ground out to the short  stop on their first pitch.
But it was so great to see the Trojan baseball team open up its season with a 17–1 win over Towson. Granted, I was only following Twitter updates of the game and not watching it live. Instead, I was at the men’s volleyball game against BYU, which proved to be much more interesting — though the Trojans fell short in four sets. Nonetheless, the victory for Trojan baseball kicked off a great weekend for USC sports and for the team’s season.
The 17-1 win was followed by a 10-0 win the next day. The final score doesn’t look as crooked, but a bagel on the scoreboard for your opponent looks just as good. Towson actually made a game out of the series finale, only losing 8-6. But it just goes to show that even in the MLB, the best teams usually call it a successful weekend when they take two out of three games. The last game wasn’t as pretty as the other two, but nonetheless, to start the season with a sweep is impressive.
USC baseball is actually one of the strongest programs historically in all of Trojan athletics. The Trojans have won more national champions than any other program with 12 — in fact, no other program has more than half of that. But the Trojans have struggled recently, missing the NCAA tournament every year since 2005. But like fellow columnist Regan Estes predicted last week, this year might be the year the Trojans finally break their slump and make the postseason.
USC baseball is at a unique disadvantage in the Pac-12. USC is one of only two teams in the conference that is hails from a private university rather than a state school; the other is Stanford. Therefore, USC has higher tuition for baseball players than the average conference opponent. For football, athletic departments are allocated enough scholarships to cover the tuition of all signed players on the roster; there are only a limited number of scholarships allotted to baseball teams. Like other nonrevenue sports, baseball can only cover a fraction of tuition for players with scholarships. But unlike recruits for other nonrevenue sports, the top baseball prospects have the option of turning pro right out of high school. With the size of contracts for those picked early in the MLB draft, these decisions about college recruitment become very financial. The best of the best, who get drafted in early rounds out of high school, might sign right away, but many prospects will wait to develop for a few years in college. If they could develop into a top pick, they could sign million-dollar signing bonuses as part of their first professional contracts. Because of the expected payout from the sport, it might not be worthwhile for a player to spend extra on a private school’s tuition if it doesn’t marginally improve one’s draft stock or ultimate signing bonus.
California is a hotbed of baseball talent in the country, but most of that talent has recently been going to UCLA. As much as it pains me to say it, the Bruins have totally had our number in baseball recently. In the last five years, the Bruins have brought two Pac-12 titles, one College World Series runner-up and one national championship back to Westwood. The 2011 MLB draft also comes to mind when thinking about UCLA baseball, when Bruins Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer were picked first and third overall in the draft.
While USC is one of the best academic institutions in the world, the education might not be the primary concern of baseball players who are confident that they will be drafted into the MLB. But for players who value their education more and also want to play competitive baseball, it’s hard to compete against Stanford. The Cardinal’s recent success is evident both from the results of the team and from the number of high draft picks from the school. The Cardinal made the playoffs two of the last three years and have produced some of the best MLB prospects, such as Mark Appel of the Houston Astros’ system and Austin Wilson of the Seattle Mariners franchise.
While recruiting some of the best players might seem like a challenge, USC also has a ton of resources available, and recruiting should be easier. The McKay Center was only unveiled a couple of years ago, and more interested athletes will see that the school really does take care of athletes.
But more importantly, the Trojans have a capable commander in manager Dan Hubbs. In only his third full year at the helm, I expect the Trojans to continue to build on the success they had last year. Baseball America ranked USC’s incoming recruiting class for this season No. 25 in the country — this is the fourth year in a row that USC has had a Top 25 class. Baseball recruiting is a challenge, as coaches want to get the best players without signing prospects who are too good and will end up going to the MLB draft. Hubbs has demonstrated his ability to find that balance during his brief time at USC, and the benefits will start to show more this year. This season, expect this strong draft class to catapult the Trojans into the playoffs.

The USC men’s tennis team faced some of the top collegiate tennis squads in Chicago this weekend for the ITA National Team Indoor Championships. The Trojans last won the tournament back in 2012, but finished as the runner-up in 2013 and 2014.  During this year’s tournament, the Trojans cruised through the first three rounds of competition but fell to Oklahoma in the final to finish second in the tournament for the third year in a row.
USC entered the tournament as the No. 1 seed and its first opponent was No. 16-seeded Penn State.  The Trojans made quick work of Penn State, winning 4-0.  In doubles play, sophomores Nick Crystal and Connor Farren beat Roman Trkulja and Michael Reilly 6-4.  Then, junior Max de Vroome and senior Eric Johnson clinched the doubles point for the Trojans with their own 6-4 win over Alex Fennell and Matt Barry.
The Trojans carried their momentum into singles action, where they needed only three matches to clinch a first-round victory.  Senior Roberto Quiroz was the first singles winner for the Trojans, taking down Fennell by a score of 6-3, 6-1.  Johnson would give the Trojans their third point of the match when he beat Trkulja with a dominating 6-1, 6-2 performance.  Senior Yannick Hanfmann won the match-clinching point for the Trojans with his defeat of Leonard Stakhovsky 6-1, 7-6 (4).
In the quarterfinals, the Trojans battled with No. 8-seeded Ohio State, the team that defeated the Trojans in last year’s final. This year’s outcome proved to be much different as the Trojans cruised over Ohio State 4-1.  Like their first round match, the Trojans needed only two matches to seal the doubles point.  Johnson and de Vroome were the first pairing to win a set in doubles play, beating Hunter Callahan and Chris Diaz by a score of 6-2.  Hanfmann and Quiroz clinched the doubles point for the Trojans a short time later with a 6-4 victory over Ralf Steinbach and Kevin Metka.
The Trojans continued to dominate in singles play, needing only four matches to punch their ticket to the next round.  Ohio State struck first in singles play when Herkko Pollanen defeated senior Jonny Wang in a 6-3, 6-2 victory, tying the score 1-1.  The Trojans responded with three-straight singles victories, which would secure the Trojans a spot in the semifinals.  Johnson started the rally with a hard fought 7-5, 6-4 victory over Steinbach.  Quiroz earned the next Trojans point, taking down Mikal Torpegaard 6-1, 7-5.  Hanfmann finished the match for the Trojans with a 7-6 (4), 6-1 win over Diaz.  It was the second-straight singles match for Hanfmann where he needed a tiebreaker to win at least one set.
The Trojans faced a very familiar opponent in the semifinals:              No. 4-seeded Georgia.  The Trojans had beaten Georgia 4-0 earlier in the month during the Pac-12/SEC showdown.  The Trojans showed that their dominating victory at the Pac-12/SEC showdown was no fluke as they took down Georgia easily once again, this time by a score of 4-1.
The lone point that Georgia won in the match was the doubles point.  Crystal and Farren were no match for Georgia’s Paul Oosterbaan and Wayne Montgomery, who beat the USC pairing 6-1.  A short time later, Hanfmann and Quiroz were bested by Ben Wagland and Austin Smith, who beat the Trojan pair 6-4 and earned Georgia the doubles point.
Singles play was a different story for the Trojans, who won every singles match until they clinched their spot in the championship round.  Johnson was the first Trojan to finish his match, earning a convincing 6-1, 6-1 victory over Nick Wood.  Crystal followed Johnson’s victory with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Oosterbaan.  Wagland gave Max de Vroome a tough time in the first set of their singles match, but Wagland was no match for de Vroome in the second set and de Vroome won the third point for the Trojans with a 7-6, 6-1 victory.  Quiroz clinched an appearance in the final round for the Trojans by winning the crucial fourth point with a 7-6 (2), 6-3 win over Smith.
In the final round, the Trojans took on the No. 2-seeded Oklahoma Sooners, the team that the Trojans beat last year to claim the NCAA title.  The Trojans fought hard but fell to the Sooners 4-2 to finish second in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships for the third consecutive year.
All three doubles matches were needed to determine the winner of the doubles point.  The Trojans drew first blood in doubles play, with Johnson and de Vroome beating Spencer Papa and Andrew Harris easily by a score of 6-1.  The other two doubles matches were much closer, but the Sooners were able to close both of them out to earn the doubles point.  Oklahoma’s Florin Bragusi and Alex Ghilea bested Crystal and Farren with a 7-5 win, and Axel Alvarez and Dane Webb edged Hanfmann and Quiroz in a 7-6 (4) victory.
The Sooners and the Trojans would continue to have tight matches in singles play.  Webb extended his team’s lead to 2-0 with a 6-0, 6-4 win over Wang.  Then, Johnson earned the Trojans their first point with a 6-4, 6-1 victory against Papa.  Next, Alvarez increased Oklahoma’s advantage to 3-1 with a 7-6 (3), 6-2 victory over Quiroz.  Crystal kept the Trojans alive with a three set, comeback win over Jose Salazar (3-6, 6-0, 6-4).  The Trojans would not be able to complete the comeback, however, and Ghilea clinched both the match and the tournament title for the Sooners with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 victory over de Vroome.
The loss against the Sooners is the first loss for the USC men’s tennis team this season, but the team still holds an impressive 9-1 record.  The Trojans will now havwe time for a much deserved rest, as they don’t play again until Feb. 27 against Pac-12 rival Stanford at Marks Stadium.

A few weeks ago, I wrote about Lil Wayne’s mixtape and his beef with former best friend and Cash Money Records figurehead, Bryan “Baby” Williams, aka  Birdman. Since then this feud has become a disaster for Birdman, with a $51 million lawsuit against him and more artists standing behind Lil Wayne. Nicki Minaj reportedly refused Birdman’s entrance to her Grammy party last week, and now fellow Cash Money rapper Drake seems to be dissing him as well. With his new album/mixtape (it’s hard to qualify, as I’ll explain later on), If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, Drake comes to Lil Wayne’s aid, hints at trying to leave Cash Money, and gives a tour-de-force in lyrical diversity.
This album originally dropped on the OVO SoundCloud as a mixtape, but was quickly taken down and re-released on iTunes and Spotify as an album, leaving fans to wonder what changed. Many people quickly speculated that Drake was using this as a way of fulfilling a contract with Cash Money, whom he owed one more album, so he could release his planned album, Views From The 6, on his own terms. While this rumor is not confirmed, it does make a lot of sense, and some of Drake’s lyrics on the album, such as in “Star67,” give insight to his relationship with Cash Money.
“Brand new Beretta, can’t wait to let it go/ Walk up in my label like where the check though?”
From here on out we will refer to it as an album, as Drake is making money on the record as if it were one, but there are many differences between an album and a mixtape, and content-wise, this release would traditionally be considered the latter.
If You’re Reading This dropped with no warning, which might seem like a poor business decision on Drake’s part, but this new method of marketing is starting to become a trend after the monumental success of Beyoncé’s self-titled album in 2013. Since the release of that album, which was tweeted about 1.2 million times in the first 12 hours of its release, artists are becoming increasingly interested in the idea of a no-hype release. Lil Wayne had no release date for his newest mixtape, Chance the Rapper let slip that his new album Surf will be released “Beyoncé-style,” and now Drake has dropped this album with no warning. As proof of concept, Spotify recently released statistics stating that If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late’s first four days shattered the record for highest streamed album by almost double, with Drake also holding the previously highest streamed album for his 2013 Nothing Was The Same.
The 17 tracks that comprise If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late are all distinctly Drake, with high-quality lyricism, strong trap beats and minimal instrumentation, and though there are no real radio hits on the album, a casual listen all the way through will leave you wanting more. This is the nature of a mixtape, as mentioned earlier. Purely released as a demonstration of skill, mixtapes are usually bare-bones and feature mostly heavy verses rather than catchy choruses so as to show an artist’s skill. It just so happens that Drake is incredibly talented, and every track flows into the next with ease. His verses throughout are both classic Drake and at the same time fresh, breathing new life into old concepts like getting money and being famous. On “10 Bands,” Drake raps not about how good it is to be on top, but how important it is to stay there.
“Drapes closed I don’t know what time it is/ I’m still awake, I gotta shine this year/ I could never ever let the streets down/ Haven’t left the condo in a week now,” raps the OVO frontman, clearly not willing to pass the baton.
His output is admirable, but the frequency with which he releases new material is almost alarming. Drake has been churning out numerous radio hits in songs by Nicki Minaj (“Truffle Butter” and “Only”), Ilovemakonnen (“Tuesday”), and Big Sean (“Blessings”), and is showing no signs of stopping. There are few artists today putting in as much work, especially those who are already successful, but Drake is an artist who is never willing to put down the pen.
If you’re looking for a crash course in how to craft a verse, this album is your handbook. Every verse is well thought out, with a steady flow that weaves around the tempo but ends perfectly on the beat; this creates a feeling that the beats were made to follow the verses, rather than the other way around. One of my favorite lines on the album is from the track “Star67,” which makes subtle reference to Drake’s former days as the wheelchair-bound Jimmy Brooks on the Canadian television show Degrassi.
“I been had these visions of the life I’m living since I was Jimmy/ All I had to do was go and get it.”
Drake is relentless and unashamed of his past, which other rappers and listeners often make fun of. Everything Drake has done helped put him on the map, though, and whatever anybody says about him, he is at the top of the rap game. While we wait for the artist’s next major work, Views From the 6, sit back, relax and enjoy in its entirety If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late.

In late January, Washington Sen. Jeanne Kohl-Welles introduced a bill in Seattle that extended the maximum penalty of sex buying from 90 days to a year in jail. Today, sex buying is defined as “patronizing a prostitute,” which is nothing more than a Class A misdemeanor. The goal of the bill is to decrease prostitution rates, as opposed to using resources to arrest prostitutes. This plan needs to be enacted because in the majority of the arrests, prostitutes are reportedly treated worse than their male patrons in a crime in which the latter is equally guilty.
There is a huge gender disparity in the arrests related to prostitution. According to the Massachusetts State Police’s data, of the 920 arrested on prostitution charges in 2014, 70 percent were women. According to the Seattle Attorney’s Office, 199 women in Washington were prosecuted on prostitution charges, compared to 98 men. This, then, is no longer about the debate on whether or not prostitution should be legal but about the negative stigma that comes with being a female prostitute.
Prostitutes often do not willingly enter the occupation. According to the International Labor Organization, 20.9 million people are victims of human trafficking. Co-founder of the Organization for Prostitution Survivors (OPS) and former prostitute Noel Gomez told The Seattle Times that she was a prostitute for a long time and has “never met one woman in my life who wants to do the work they’re doing. Not one.” She herself was forced into prostitution as a teen and still feels troubled by the experience.
It is even more abhorrent that men are being charged with plain misdemeanors for taking advantage of girls who are prostitutes, sometimes against their will. Society instills the double standard of sexuality among men and women: a man who wishes to have several sexual partners is seen as a put on a pedestal, while a woman who wishes to do the same is scrutinized. The double standard is awful in any other setting such as high schools and college campuses, but at least the issue is widely recognized. In prostitution, however, the gender disparity is even more appalling. If the states want to consider prostitution a crime, then they must do so for both sides of the offending party. Regardless of prostitution laws, women and men should be prosecuted and judged in exactly the same way.
Hopefully, Washington will be the first of many states that will target the demand side of prostitution.  About a decade ago, Sweden changed their laws on prostitution, outlawing the buying of sex and making the selling of it legal. This reform targets the right people instead of prostitutes. In five years, the prostitution rates in this Scandinavian country went down by 40 percent and have continued to decrease over the years. As the first state to start targeting gender disparity more aggresively, Washington will not only help decrease the rates, but it will also help raise awareness on the importance of gender equality over such a divisive subject.
sex is not about 1 night stands with strangers…..think about it……….
How about we don’t prosecute either side?

Three Muslim college students were shot in the head by Craig Hicks last Tuesday near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and yet mainstream media quickly wrote the shooting off as the actions of a crazed individual, instead of recognizing it as a race-based hate crime. News outlets circulated the tried-and-true role of mental health in shootings and an interview with the shooter’s wife during which she spouted her husband’s belief that “everyone is equal” — a sentiment notably absent from his social media posts that ridiculed religion. Only public outrage after police reported the motive of the shooting to be over a parking ticket led media sources to even fully cover the story, let alone reveal the religious hatred from which it stems.
The media’s immediate response reveals an inherent double standard in the way religious violence is treated in this country. Headlines regarding the Chapel Hill shooting read “Chapel Hill shooting: When is a crime a ‘hate crime’?” and “Were UNC shootings a hate crime or parking dispute?” It’s almost laughable the way media has tiptoed around admitting the Chapel Hill shooting was a hate crime.
Another term conspicuously missing from reports on the Chapel Hill shooting is the “terrorism.” Not a single major U.S. news outlet described the act as one of terrorism in its headline — the only mention of the label came in quotation marks to describe Saudi Arabia’s declaration of the act as one of terrorism. This incident has arguably met the three criteria for terrorism (“an act that takes place in the United States, that’s dangerous to human life, and is intended to intimidate civilians or affect government policy by ‘mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping’”). CNN asserts that the legal absence of the terrorism label allowed authorities to more easily pursue the death penalty, but the blatant absence of the label reflects the desire to frame the incident as an isolated act rather than an act of extremism.
The public, unfortunately, is not exempt from the same indifference to Chapel Hill. Where was the social media movement equivalent to “Je Suis Charlie” or #BlackLivesMatter to mourn the losses of students Razan Abu-Salha, Yusor Abu-Salha and Deah Barakat in North Carolina? Though of course the Chapel Hill shooting has a different context than those of Charlie Hebdo or Michael Brown, the lack of a public response of the same magnitude reveals a deep-seated Islamophobia. It is disappointing that we are all too eager to stand in solidarity and outrage over the Islamic extremist shooting at Charlie Hebdo and stay silent when extremists shoot Muslims.
Of course, it is easy to criticize the public for staying silent without recognizing why they do so. Religious hate in this country has so often been painted with Islam behind the gun, not in front of it. Since Islamic extremism has endangered American lives, it is much more convenient to unilaterally view Islam as evil. Thus, this view underlies the subtext of racially charged conversations. Oklahoma Rep. John Bennett illustrated the prevalence of such a view when he referred to Islam as “not even a religion.”
Thus, given America’s history with Islamic extremism, Islamophobia is easy, comfortable and pervasive. These attributes, however, do not make this religious hatred any less revolting. American Islamophobia rests upon layers of hypocrisy; a country that so readily worships the respect of the freedom of religion ignores Islam, and prejudice of Islam prejudices our own Muslim Americans, three of whom paid the ultimate price of Islamophobia with their lives last week.
The shooting at Chapel Hill has arguably had its share in the limelight, soon to be replaced by another shooting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in which an Islamic extremist claimed two European lives. And as the cycle of violence continues between Islamic and Eurocentric cultures, the argument among those outraged by violence continues, and begs the question, which shootings should the public care about, and why? People will inevitably argue that it is unfair for us to mourn the loss at Chapel Hill but ignore the Copenhagen incident. Blood has been spilled on all sides for centuries, and the public has run out of places to point fingers.
Race and religion-based violence continues to tear this country apart. It is important to realize that all lives matter, but this statement requires the condition that we understand the cultural, racial and political frameworks in which violence occurs. The biggest challenge that religious and racial violence faces is a supposedly colorblind society that refuses to understand the greater implications; it is important to understand that Michael Brown was not shot just because he was skulking around, just as the Chapel Hill victims were not shot because of a parking ticket. Extremism lies on all sides, and every racial and religious shooting carries the historical and political baggage of the cultural relationships that have persisted for centuries.

When you think of the Los Angeles food scene, there are countless restaurants, lounges and cafes that come to mind. From Downtown, to the Westside, to Silver Lake, Angelenos have a multitude of options to choose from in terms of dining, drinks and overall sense of lifestyle. None, however, carry the clout and gravitas of one of Los Angeles’ most iconic locations, Urth Caffe.
Urth, to its very core, personifies Los Angeles. With world-class organic coffee, delightful pastries and desserts, and an incontrovertible sense of posh L.A. brass, Urth is the intersection of trendy and quality. Whenever someone who is new to L.A. asks me where should they go to eat, I invariably tell them to go to Urth. It’s the perfect stepping stone and an ideal introduction to what the City of Angels is all about.
I had a chance to catch up with the co-founder of Urth Caffe, Shallom Berkman, and discuss all things Urth. His personal story and the story of his café have truly taught us heaven is a place on Urth.
A: Tell us a little bit about yourself and how you grew up. 
SB: Well, I was born in West Hollywood, CA so I’m a Southern California native. I attended Hollywood High School, but never graduated.
A: Urth has a long history, from its humble beginnings to its current fame. Could you describe briefly the genesis of Urth Caffe?
SB: I’ve always had a desire to sell natural, environmentally conscious products; home products, consumer products and the like. My wife, Jilla, a University of Tehran graduate, always had a strong passion and dream to open up a café. She’s a phenomenal business manager with a refined acumen and propensity for excellence. Urth initially began as a catalog for healthy living, selling organic coffee beans from the farms of Peru. By the late 1980s, the catalog had witnessed some success and in 1991, the first Urth store opened in Manhattan Beach, CA. It was the first organic coffee roaster in the United States. In 1994, another location was added on Melrose Ave. Pastries, snacks, and food were added to the menu, creating the contemporary rendition of Urth Caffe. The name of Urth Caffe comes from an old Welsh spelling of the world “earth” and Caffe is Italian for coffee.
A: When you set out to create Urth, what did you envision it to be? 
SB: My wife and I initially had some differences. She dreamed of a full-fledged café. I saw more of a retail business. What we both wanted, and really, what Urth is all about, is a dedication to coffee. I travel around the world teaching farmers how to grow the perfect coffee bean. It’s the attention to detail and passion for perfect tasting coffee that Urth is built on.
A: With Urth being an iconic location in Los Angeles, did you ever imagine Urth reaching this amount of success? 
SB: Who could not have possibly known what was to come. We took things one at a time and stayed dedicated. We’ve been proud and happy of our business, but we could not have foreseen the popularity.
A: Do you stay involved with all the celebrity promotion, if you will, of Urth on social media platforms, such as Instagram? 
SB: We’re not involved at all with that. It’s great that people love our café and have positive experiences, but we don’t go out and ask people to post or promote. All that is as organic as our coffee.
A: Do you have any plans for expansion? 
SB: We’re currently renovating an old, iconic restaurant in Laguna Beach called The Cottage. Laguna Beach is a great town with a lot of culture and galleries. It’s ideal for another Urth location. We were unsure of the status of the property, but the owner was actually willing to sell. It was almost like destiny how things worked out. We’re hoping to preserve the rich history of the place. We’re finishing up restorations and look to open May 2015.
If we find other locations, such as this 1888 building we’ve seen near Chapman University, we’ll consider adding other locations if the timing is right.
A: Are you interested in franchising?
SB: No. We have two shops in Tokyo and I visit them when I can, but we’re not interested in franchising.
A: With a boom in independent cafes and coffee shops in L.A., how do you feel about the increased competition? 
SB: We have some unique qualities that differentiates us from other establishments. We have organic, heirloom crops. It’s non-GMO, ancient-variety coffee. Other shops are more in this new style of coffee: under-roasted, light, dark flavor, very low heat, watery, acidic. The coffee isn’t being fully utilized properly and its not satisfying. In a sense, you lose the character of the coffee that way. We’re more organic oriented. We don’t use hybrid trees to produce more, those tend to lessen the quality of products. Actually, there’s really no interest in exclusively organic coffee like us in terms of competitors. We’re sort of left alone in our niche.
A: Besides your own café, what is your favorite restaurant/café to visit in L.A.? 
SB: Joan’s on Third. It’s a great little café and they’re doing an awesome job over there.
A: Any advice for budding entrepreneurs and businesspeople? 
SB: Apply a lot of passion. You can’t give up, always stay with the path. You have to be in it for more than the money as well. Hard work ethic is key, be service-minded because there is a loss of appreciation nowadays in quality service and that culture is disappearing. If you work hard, stay focused, apply your passion and never give up, things will work out.

When someone says “college basketball,” the first thing that comes to most people’s minds is March Madness and the chaos of the NCAA Tournament. It is one of the few events in sports where virtually anyone has chance to win and an eight seed or higher has a chance to be crowned national champions. But this reputation has its consequences for the image of the sport, and it needs a fix-up.
Due to the mayhem of March, the college basketball regular season has been rendered insignificant. Everyone only watches March Madness. Basically, as long as power conference teams have a decent season and win over 20 games, they get a spot in the tournament.
At the same time, teams from other conferences may win all their games but lose their conference tournament and get no spot in the NCAA tournament. Furthermore, great teams who had great regular seasons can get knocked out early while teams who had mediocre seasons may go far and even win. Last year, Wichita State went undefeated, 35-0, before losing in the second round of the tournament to runner-up Kentucky. In 2011, Ohio State, a football school, had the basketball team and season of a lifetime going 32-2 in the regular season, winning the Big Ten, the Big Ten Tournament and crushed George Mason 98-66 in the second round of the NCAA tournament before losing in the third round also to Kentucky.
On the other hand, there have been some teams historically who had less than great regular seasons who went on to go far in the tournament. UConn last year had seven regular season losses including losing their finale to Louisville by 33 points, yet they found a way to win the NCAA Tournaments. In addition, there was a lot of uproar in 2011 when VCU made the field of 68 with a 23-11 regular season and dropped six of their last 11 games including the CAA Tournament, but that team made it all the way to the final four.
Sixty-eight teams play, but only one can win. What’s the point for fans to watch the regular season when it will break their heart in March and it gest them hyped up for nothing? What’s the point for fans to watch their teams struggle in the regular season when they virtually have just as decent a shot as anyone else to win the national championship come March? College basketball has no desirable product to sell 11 months of the year.
To fix college basketball, I propose a mid-season eight-team tournament to play for not only pride but also an automatic spot in the NCAA Tournament at the end of the season.
Firstly, it will keep the college basketball season packed. This first half of the season would be geared to getting a spot in this top eight and as a result the games would count for a lot more. There would be a lot more hype surrounding the beginning of the season non-conference matchups, and like in college football would be viewed as possible elimination games. Teams would have to play themselves into this tournament by winning all but two or three of their games. Advertisers and marketers rather than using mottos as “Journey to the Tourney,” could sell the first half of the college basketball season as trying to “make the eight,” or use something similar to the college football playoff motto, “Who’s in?”
Nonetheless, the second half of the season will maintain the same intensity as teams attempt to rack up conference championships, conference tournament championships and a good spot in the NCAA tournament. This midseason tournament keeps the college basketball season full of action, and looking forward to something that is two months and 15-20 games away rather than something that is four months and 35 games away.
This system also gives teams a chance to show something for their hard work and skill in one of the hardest sports there is when it comes to winning championships. Firstly, it gives lesser-known teams a better chance to prove themselves and a chance to earn an automatic ticket to “the dance.” College basketball is one of the few sports that gives really anyone a chance to win a national championship; however, it is much easier for a small-known team to make a name for themselves in a field of eight rather than 68. Maybe one of these less prestigious teams who is undefeated and is rolling in the first half of the season can make a name for themselves and their conference. A rule can be put forth that at least one non-power conference team has to be selected. In addition, the teams throughout college basketball history who have had once in a lifetime seasons, maybe even gone undefeated, won their conference and then lost in the NCAA tournament would have something else to show for their talent and work. The 2010-2011 Ohio States, the 2007-2008 Memphis’ (38-2 and runner-up to Kansas) came so far and achieved so much and do not have much to show for it other than maybe a conference championship and conference tournament championship.
This proposed set-up would give these great teams who might finished a little cold a chance to not only qualify for a competitive and selective midseason tournament, but also a chance to earn a championship in three games rather than six.

This week, lottery for USC Housing next year is set from today through Thursday. Though USC Housing offers great off-campus options like CarGar, Century and Troy to its students, sometimes, it’s just not enough. Here are a few non-university-owned alternatives that are worth trying. If you are still confused as to where to live next year, read on and find what suits you best.
The Lorenzo 
This apartment complex is modeled like an expensive Las Vegas hotel. Its endless amenities attract many of the students who are down for a good time. You can snag a bed space here anywhere from $899-$1409. This is the most affordable living offered to USC students. However, there are some downfalls. This get-away is the furthest apartment complex from campus. Although its services include buses that travel every 15 minutes around campus, it is not guaranteed that everyone who needs to get on will fit. Students complain about constant fire alarms, bad service and the shuttles being too small.

New Mansion
Located right next to the mysterious restaurant with a “B” rating, New Mansion has a lot to offer. This complex is designed with multiple variations of floor plan. Some of the apartments are two – three stories tall! The inside of the apartments are very clean and have the best “home away from home” vibe. The workout room is up to date, and it is just one block away from campus. However, renting an apartment here is quite the investment. The units come unfurnished. That’s right, you have to buy all your furniture. If you are a rising sophomore this could be a good place to look into. If you are willing to live here for a few years, the furniture may not be a big problem. Just be ready to pay for Wifi!

University Gateway
“Thank you for calling University Gateway, you’re just a step off of campus, how may I help you?” Gateway is excellent at grabbing new students and taking them in. Their marketing team emphasizes that it is right across the street from campus, and that it is the most convenient place to live. Below the apartment complex is Fresh & Easy, CVS, and a few restaurants. Seems like an ideal place to be. But the negatives may outweigh the positives depending on what you like. The complex’ staff rarely breaches the age of 25, thus leading to confusion on how to fix annoying situations. Have a broken light in your room? Expect it to take a few weeks to be fixed. Don’t expect too much from maintenance here.

Icon Plaza
Let’s just say this place is pretty much irrelevant. It is far from all the other student housing (other than Tuscany), and never have I heard anyone say they live here. If you are ok with being on the opposite side of campus from all the other apartment complexes then go for it! It is about the same cost as Gateway, $999 per bed space, and is close to many food options. Starbucks!

Tuscany
The complex is appealing to the eye. Located right above Chipotle and Cold Stone, it is a popular destination on game days. The management is good and the rooms are high quality. Being one of the two apartments furthest from the row, not a lot of people involved in Greek life choose to life here. Many of the international student opt to live in this complex, and the study rooms are always full. Tuscany is best suited for grad students or people who want a super short walk to the business school. If you’re looking to be right in the heart of Greek life, try living in the Row House.

“What gives me uncontrollable gas?”
“Auschwitz.”
The statement precedes a brief period of silence followed by ebullient laughter. There are few games more highly treasured to the college student than Cards Against Humanity, the card game in which players fill in a sentence given by a card with one of their own. The twist is that the cards are noticeably R-rated (like “coat-hanger abortions” and “dead parents”) — thus allowing horrifying and hilarious results. But perhaps we find these jokes so wildly funny because, in an era more politically correct than ever before, we increasingly internalize injustice.
Granted, there are several identifiable lines of hypothesis to the humor of offensive jokes. For one, there is the shock factor associated with the effrontery to fly in the face of the political correctness that requires us to tiptoe around sensitive issues. We could use offensive jokes as an outlet to talk about important issues without the burden of necessitated grief that comes with such a conversation.
But I don’t think that anyone plays Cards Against Humanity because they want to talk about serious issues.
There’s an undeniable sense of relief when laughing at an offensive joke. Offensive jokes could be a coping mechanism for daily tragedies — a refreshingly new reaction to heartbreaking calamities that we realistically can do nothing to change. Or it could be our way of stuffing the lid on the can of the Holocaust or dead babies so we don’t have to think about the agony of those events. Offensive humor, then, could be indicative of a greater psychological inability to properly deal with the injustices that we are exposed to in daily life.
The question to ask is if our laughter associated with an offensive joke is inherently a negative attribute. Some could view offensive humor as rooted in the German concept of “schadenfreude,” or pleasure created by others’ misfortune. Schadenfreude elicits the same kind of visceral reaction as one would from watching others fall down flat on their faces. As philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer called one of the most evil sins of mankind, schadenfreude is thought to occur out of comfort that it is not us but rather others that incur hardship,
Yet again, I strike down the theory that offensive humor stems from schadenfreude. We don’t laugh at date rape or alcoholism because of a “them-not-us” mentality. It is, rather, a silent acknowledgement of the hardships that the past and present has brought to civilization and a steadfast decision to move forward despite them.

Sometimes study abroad takes you to places you never knew you wanted to go to.
For me, that was Stonehenge.
As my roommates and I boarded the filled-to-capacity bus for our day trip to Stonehenge, all I could think to myself was, I will be spending the next three hours looking at a conglomerate of rocks. I mean, Prehistoric rocks.
No one knows why Stonehenge was built. Historians estimate that Neolithic builders arranged the mighty stones about 5,000 years ago. The intricate process of arranging the stones took more than 1,500 years. Some guess that it was used as burial grounds. Others hypostasize that it was used for religious rituals. But either way, more than 1 million people visit Stonehenge each year. UNESCO World Heritage Site has named it on its list for the past 30 years.
As the bus pulled up to Stonehenge, I still couldn’t muster up the energy to see this world wonder. They were rocks at the end of the day. But I decided now probably wasn’t the time to vocalize these opinions.
Going to Stonehenge was literally a breath of fresh air. In my four weeks of studying abroad, Stonehenge was my first time being in the English countryside. London is too metropolitan to ever be considered a green pasture despite all its parks. As I trudged my way up to the massive stones, shuffling past the loads of tourists with their DSLR cameras and selfie sticks, I realized why I needed to be there.
On my bus ride, I had learned that the site was used as a training ground for British soldiers in World War I and before preservation laws took effect people carelessly carved their names into the rocks. I also discovered that Stonehenge is older than most world wonders, such as the Great Wall of China in Beijing. Its history was profound.
Even more so, its modern beauty was breathtaking. The sun was hitting the rocks at a celestial angle. It cast a blanket of light that created the perfect photo op. It illuminated a whole new outlook for me.
So, my day trip in Stonehenge proved itself to be a place that I never knew I wanted to go. But I’m so glad my study abroad experience placed me there.
