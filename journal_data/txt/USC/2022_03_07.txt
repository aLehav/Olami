At the end of February, USC began distributing packs of Lysol wipes in piles across campus with little indication to students where they were from. Many were mystified by the stacks of Lysol wipes that appeared in dorm buildings, in customer service centers and at the Trojan Farmer’s Market.
Lydia Acevedo, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, described coming into the foyer of their dorm building in the USC Village and seeing stacks of around 200 Lysol wipes. Similarly, Linda Gist, a student worker at New North Residential College, said she was told that there was an “influx of Lysol wipes” that students could pick up, but wasn’t given information beyond that. 
The distribution of the free Lysol wipes was part of a larger campaign between the USC Institute on Inequalities in Global Health and Reckitt, the manufacturer of Lysol, to aid the local community and raise awareness around vaccine inequity. 
“The on-campus product distribution was a one-time collaboration between the USC Institute on Inequalities in Global Health and Reckitt, and is unrelated to the university’s COVID-19 prevention programs, health services and policies,” the University wrote in an emailed statement to the Daily Trojan.
In early February, Reckitt announced it was going to donate 4 million packs of Lysol wipes to USC IIGH in partnership with Operation USA, Los Angeles Food Bank and Shelter Partnership to distribute to 16 community organizations across L.A. 
Director of USC IIGH Sofia Gruskin, a professor of population of public health sciences and law, said that recipient organizations were chosen based on the strength of USC’s relationship with them and where there was the greatest need for the products.
“One of the things that has been really important in terms of engaging with Reckitt has been to be able to … get access to, in this case, Lysol products that can then be made available to our community-based organizations that we work with,” Gruskin said. “We also wanted to bring some of that back to USC to our own students and faculty and staff.”
The packs of Lysol wipes were widely available to USC students and staff, stacked in foyers of dorm buildings, in piles of boxes at the Trojan Farmer’s Market, and available even at some campus entrances. Students in residence halls such as Pardee Tower, Marks Tower and Birnkrant Residential College, received emails that USC Housing staff members would go into their rooms and leave the Lysol wipes on their desks.
Nancy Shao, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said that she doesn’t actually intend to use the Lysol wipes, but that the initiative is helpful because he can donate the wipes to the South Hill Community Fridge. 
“It is pretty convenient because it’s less things that I have to buy at the store,” said Lindsey Thomas, a freshman majoring in biology. 
However, the primary goal of this campaign wasn’t to distribute the Lysol wipes, but instead to encourage vaccine and booster education, Gruskin said.
“It’s not actually about products at all. It’s actually, absolutely, purely in the context of vaccine equity and the work that we do around that,” Gruskin said.
To achieve this, IIGH is working with local artists and community groups to design a public mural based on the mission of education, Gruskin said. The organization is still deliberating the most appropriate and effective location for the site of the mural, and said that the unveiling will likely take place in early April.
“The institute sees Los Angeles as part of the globe, and so we’re concerned with addressing inequalities in L.A. as much as we are concerned with addressing inequalities in other places,” Gruskin said.
Though IIGH has many community relations, to advance their mission, this campaign is the first time the institute has partnered with a corporation rather than with community organizations, Gruskin said.
“One of the things that I think COVID has taught me, at least, is the need to extend beyond our regular partners,” Gruskin said. “We’re really trying to work with new partners, and I’m really pleased because it seems Reckitt feels like a really honorable partner.”
Throughout the pandemic, Reckitt has made similar donations of Lysol products to Title I schools across the country. On its website, the company states its goal “to make access to the highest quality hygiene, wellness and nourishment a right and not a privilege.”
Gruskin said she hopes students can get behind IIGH’s goal of working together to address vaccine inequity and encourages students to engage with the institute by joining their mailing list and attending their events.
“We are very committed to engaging with student organizations and to student groups and are looking to the Student Advisory Council to help us to engage with organizations,” Gruskin said.

As a Pisces sun with a Scorpio moon, to say I cry a lot would be an understatement. You can blame my Leo rising for bringing attention to it. Elated? Tears. Exhausted? More tears. Enraged? Enough tears to flood my basement and drown my enemies (if I had any). 
I am sure my therapist would have a different explanation for why I cannot get through life without crying, but I have made it through 22 years of life by blaming everything either on my birth chart or my parents’ genes. I suggest you do the same for a happier and tear-filled life. 
Keep in mind, I am by no means a therapist, but being in tune with your emotions and doing a deep cleansing of your body every couple of days by crying seems like a no-brainer. It’s not quite as simple as it sounds. 
If you have not mastered the art of crying at any moment’s notice by using a memory bank of traumatic scenarios and past failures, it can be hard to know where to begin. My personal favorite is listening to sad songs by yourself and really feeling like they’re the soundtrack for your life. Dig deep and you’ll find the aftermath is a lightness from eradicating all those pesky emotions.     
Life is exhausting, to say the least and, sometimes, crying through it is just what the doctor ordered. You should absolutely seek help if you can’t seem to do anything but cry or can’t find humor during these trying times, but in moderate proportions, tears could be all you need. 
To start you on your crying journey, here are a few of my tried and tested favorite places because having the perfect backdrop and soundtrack is key to sobbing: 
Zoom
It’s the perfect multitasking tool. You may have heard of buying groceries, drinking, sleeping, cooking, working out and driving while attending Zoom meetings, but let me introduce you to crying as you figure out complex concepts during Zoom classes. 
If you wear glasses or sniffle, I would suggest having a box of tissues on your desk, so you can keep working as tears flow down your cheeks. Keep in mind that this only works if you’re allowed to keep your camera and microphone off during Zoom. Please do not try crying on-camera as it will alarm fellow participants and force you to change identities or leave town. 
Pros: multitasking, more brain space to store difficult information, a chapter for your memoir.
Cons: slippery keyboard, difficulty paying attention, camera/mic needs to be off.

In the shower
 This is one of my personal favorite places to get a quick cry in before going about my day, and I’m surprised more people don’t know about it. A baptism of its own, crying in the shower is the cleanest and most efficient way to get your tears in. You don’t have to worry about your glasses, waste tissues or find ways to hide that you were crying. 
Pros: clean, efficient, don’t have to cover up, good for the environment.
Cons: expensive water bills, alarmed roommates.

Annenberg bathrooms
 A quintessential classic. You cannot graduate from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism without having a breakdown or crying in the bathrooms at least once. The bathrooms are clean, don’t smell and are usually not crowded so you can still have your personal space. There’s also a full-length, high-quality mirror, if you’re worried whether your outfit will distract people from looking at your face too closely.
Pros: washing your face once you’re done, endless tissues, fastest way of opening up to Annenberg peers trying to get through their day.
Cons: awkward, might run into professor right after, non-ideal soundtrack.   

Trousdale
 Want to feel like you’re in a movie surrounded by people, yet feeling alone? Trousdale may be the place for you. Filled with students rushing to-and-from classes and home to a number of Hollywood productions including “Legally Blonde,” “The Graduate” and “Gilmore Girls,” among others, you’ll be in good company. I would recommend walking while crying and avoiding eye contact with anyone you pass. 
Pros: perfect backdrop, getting steps in, your own Hollywood cameo.
Cons: danger of running into someone you know, being exposed, wet shirt.

Norris Cinema Theatre
 A recent accidental discovery, Norris Cinema Theatre is the ideal place to cry surrounded by classmates without anyone finding out. The chairs are comfy; the temperature is cold and you can watch a movie as you sob. If you get caught, you could always say something about the movie affected you so deeply that you had no choice but to tear up. 
Pros: excuse for crying, perfect soundtrack, dark/theater lights.
Cons: no-noise crying, need to exit for hydration, surrounded by more than 50 people.

The Daily Trojan Newsroom
 My most-cried place, Daily Trojan’s newsroom has a variety of options for all your crying needs — the main newsroom, the balcony with a view of Tommy Trojan, your desk while designing the next day’s paper, the Editor-in-Chief office couch as you spill pasta all over yourself, the printer room after the InDesign file gets corrupted past the deadline or the secluded old sports office. The best part? Everybody in there is always so close to tears that you could start a crying circle! 
Pros: options, friends to cry with, ghost of my past tears.
Cons: unprofessional, no newspaper if you cause a crying revolution, inability to stop crying anytime you visit.
The location and music options are endless once the tears begin to flow. Just remember, once you’re done crying — pick yourself up, go after everything you want and fight for your happiness as long as you’re alive one tear at a time.

With the close of this year’s Undergraduate Student Government presidential elections, USC essentially witnessed a shoo-in victory with president-elects Hannah Woodworth and Nivea Krishnan. As the sole ticket on the ballot with only two write-in competitors, Woodworth and Krishnan easily won with 55% of the ballot votes, culminating in 2,453 votes according to Tuesday’s USG  senate meeting.
In an ideal circumstance, students would have come across various tickets to find a sincere, competent candidate that accurately represented them in their visions for their college experience. The key word is variation, which elections this year failed to provide.
With only one ticket on the ballot (not including write-in candidates), the lack of diversity paints a disturbing and grim future upholding democratic processes. The call for competent electorates is stronger than ever, but a one-ticket election makes representing a student body of 21,000 undergraduate students virtually impossible. 
Those unfamiliar with USG may not fully grasp the severity of this issue. According to its website, USG serves as the “official governing body of undergraduate students at [USC]” and arguably controls a significant portion in defining the student experience at the University. 
Allowing a one-party ticket to control the ballots in this manner sets a disturbing precedent for future elections. 
Students also contribute to the majority of USG’s annual budget under the Undergraduate Student Programming Fee, which consists of a mandatory $64 fee credited to each semester. Seeing as students directly contribute toward USG’s hefty budget of $2.5 million for the 2021-2022 school year, the representation of student voices becomes all the more significant and should be amplified through the running candidates. 
However, a one-party candidacy offers no range in representation for the 21,000 undergraduate students at USC. This year, the Hannah-Nivea ticket appeared to be the front-runners to win this election, not because of its vision to improve the student experience but due to a lack of proper competition. 
By monopolizing the ballots in this manner, tickets may lose their incentive for competition, allowing for complacency to replace the original motivations candidates held to appeal to the majority of voters. 
Furthermore, the lack of tickets may allow for potentially incompetent candidates to enter an influential position. Candidates are less likely to be held accountable for their controversial stances, and lose the incentive to improve. 
To combat this, Woodworth and Krishnan have greater obligations to fulfill their campaign promises. This ticket must now demonstrate its capabilities for the presidential and vice presidential seat, which in previous years, the election would have accomplished. 
But, like many candidates, the duo has its flaws and imperfections that need addressing and improving. Beyond a platform point with intangible goals and abstract visions based on “accountability, advocacy and accessibility,” as stated in the duo’s mission statement, the ticket has found themselves in controversy, even before its election. 
Although this aspect of the ticket’s interview with the Daily Trojan Editorial Board received backlash from the student body, as demonstrated by Instagram comments on Woodworth and Nivea’s promotional account, the duo’s status as the only ticket on the ballot cemented them as strong candidates for presidency. 
Woodworth and Krishnan must realize that they cannot attribute their election success to their own competency. Regardless of its propositions to improve the school or even their visions for change, the Hannah-Nivea ticket’s success is largely due to its singular status on the ticket ballot. 
The Daily Trojan Editorial Board’s decision to not endorse a specific ticket, unlike previous years, signaled the failure of this year’s election candidates to accurately represent the student body. The monopolization of the ballot, though unintentional, points to an unfair and undemocratic election.
With rampant issues and contentions currently ongoing on campus, such as the Greek life controversy and coronavirus regulations, the call for competent leadership rings louder every day. The USG president should lead the school to a better place, and we can only hope Woodworth and Krishnan follow through on their promises to do just that.

It’s been more than a month since my previous column, meaning so much has gone on in Los Angeles sports. 
USC’s Pac-12 regular-season title chances were buried after losing to Arizona. The Clippers stayed steady in the Western Conference playoff race. And the Lakers, well, they stink. 
But, as a self-proclaimeddie-hard Lakers fan, I’m not going to use this column as a space to rant about them. Their season needs to end sooner rather than later for the sake of many Laker fans’ well being. That’s all I have to say about them. 
Since it’s March, my return to column glory is simple. I know you’ve missed seeing my glasses and smile. I must talk about the madness involved with this Trojans’ hoops program. 
Let me get straight to it: USC needs to have another deep run in March. I thought after that Elite Eight trip, the disrespect toward Trojans basketball would be over. Boy, was I wrong. 
During most press conferences, Head Coach Andy Enfield is prone to include statistics self-proclaiming USC’s season. The numbers show that this is a program that’s been among the most successful in school history the previous three seasons. 
A head coach should not have to hype his own team up, but it’s the seat he’s in — trying to sell a program that is constantly disrespected, even with impressive win totals. 
With 72 wins during that time, it’s a school record that breaks the older record from 2016 to 2018, and this season’s 25 regular season wins break another school record. With two wins at the Pac-12 Tournament, this team would break the record for most wins in a season, including the postseason. 
Those numbers make a case for this program to be among the country’s best. But, the numbers lie in this situation. 
There’s a silly little reason as to why the Trojans are disrespected nationally. One that’s so obvious, so in your face clear, so “God, is this bracketology real?” that we often blind ourselves to it.
USC’s schedule is, simply, soft. 
Its non-conference opponents this year included schools such as Cal State Northridge, Dixie State, Eastern Kentucky and Long Beach State, among others. With the utmost respect to those schools, wins over them do not jump out on a resume going into March Madness. 
The Trojans this season had the 66th toughest schedule, behind five Pac-12 schools, including UCLA and Arizona. You can’t wonder why there’s a lack of respect and why the Galen Center is often empty when the early season matchups are, frankly, not exciting. 
When you look at the Bruins, some of their non-conference opponents were Gonzaga, Villanova and Marquette — three staples of college basketball. When you look at the Wildcats, some of their non-conference opponents were Michigan, Tennessee and Illinois — three more staples of college basketball. 
If Mike Bohn and company want to improve this program nationally, there must be more enticing non-conference games. For one, these games show how the program fares against top college basketball programs. It’s obvious why this is important because it will highlight where growth needs to take place.
Having these matchups is also a great way to increase hype on campus. Frankly, when USC plays any school other than UCLA, or Arizona this year, the student section is practically nonexistent.
The entire atmosphere of Galen Center? I’ll let redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin explain how it looked during a non-conference matchup. 
“Pacific, it was a library in here,” said Goodwin before the UCLA game. “So, I’m hoping, I’m praying, if there’s sellout fans, sellout crowd like they said they have in years past, I want to take a picture of it so I can frame it on the wall, because I don’t know if it’s going to happen again.”
That’s not a good look for the program to have, even if Goodwin might have just been cracking a joke.
To increase fan attendance, there’s a magical formula. 
1. You have to play well, and USC has been doing that for the last five seasons. Winning silences everything. 
2. There need to be exciting star players on the floor. Last year was a perfect example of this with forward Evan Mobley on the court, but the coronavirus pandemic put a wrench in everything. The Trojans have the sixth-best recruiting class next season too. 
3. You need to bring as many household programs as possible. This is USC. Why can’t Duke come to play here in a November matchup? Even if overmatched, it’s a good litmus test.
The athletic department must try. Bohn has been adamant about creating a strong basketball culture with the Trojans. He hit it out of the park with hiring Lincoln Riley, but that’s just one program. 
It’s time to hold Bohn accountable before one of the program’s winningest coaches makes a move. Enfield has been vigorously linked to Maryland in recent weeks, making it seem like he might be out. 
If Enfield’s gone, bye-bye to any more national relevancy and bring on the disrespect.

An overture is often placed at the beginning of a musical and serves as a form of foreshadowing, which is achieved through the physical lyrics indicating plot or musical motifs that will come back in later songs. It draws in viewers who curiously anticipate what is coming next and it helps keep fans entertained. 
This form of predicting and giving hints  — if you’re paying close enough attention — though, is also seen in fashion week invitations. Each invitation reveals a lot about the show that is to follow. And, in the world of fashion — where we are constantly chasing the next trend/item/it-bag — having any form of hint to give your article or brand a leg up is greatly appreciated.
What makes these invitations cryptic, though, is that they are usually peculiar gifts, not just a card and some sweet treats to nibble on. Many remember how, Gucci once sent a paper-mache mask of Hermaphroditus, Fendi sent their list a pack of Rummo pasta with their logo, Jacquemus once sent a loaf of bread and Anna Sui sent a bandana with the details of the show printed in the center. All of these invitations motivated fans to speculate on what the fashion houses’ intention. 
But this fashion week, Balenciaga took personal fashion to an entirely new level. They sent their invite on a cracked iPhone 6s that is “nonfunctional and to be used for display purposes only” (it literally says that on their card), with the recipient’s name and the location of the show laser printed on the back. 
This season is not the first time Balenciaga went with something unexpected — its invitation for its Spring 22 show was printed on a receipt. It not only included the details of its show but also had a QR code to see the digital presentation as well as the lyrics to Edith Piaf’s “La Vie En Rose.” 
Some may play off this invitation as a highly creative way to get the brand’s name buzzing on social media platforms through posts and reposts of its invite from a street style photographer Bryan “Bryanboy” Yambao, London stylist, and Creative Director Jaime-Maree Shipton, and streetwear blog, High Snobiety. Fans in the comments even speculated that it hinted toward a futuristic or even digital aspect to its collection. With Balenciaga creating some of the most outrageous looks of the past year (think Kim Kardashian at the 2021 Met Gala), fans can only imagine what the iconic fashion house wants to showcase for its newest collection. 
We’ve already seen the meshing of technology and art through NFTs and technology and fashion, with Jonathan Simkhai launching his FW collection in the metaverse on Feb. 15 and blending all three with Dolce & Gabbana launching the first NFT clothing collection in September 2021. And, in case you haven’t heard, apparently Metaverse fashion week is scheduled to happen from March 24-27, right after Milan, which is rumored to have the digital collections available to view and purchase as well as a virtual after party. 
Even in a virtual fashion week, some brands asked to make some select viewers VIP or give them front row seats, proving that fashion will remain exclusive, even over V.R. Metaverse fashion week will be an interesting test to see if in-person runways are still the way to go. 
Besides what’s next for fashion? Will virtual clothes and VR lenses become our future? I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.

As each day gets closer and closer to 90° highs, it’s hard not to dreamily envision a summer ahead, free of midterms and 8 a.m.’s. With a new season around the corner, it’s hard to fight the urge to completely remodel your closet to welcome the summer months (especially when you have an uncontrollable online shopping addiction).
So, if you’re looking for a summer update, trying to implement a few new statement pieces into your outfit rotation or if you’re thinking of endlessly scrolling  through these exclusively online shops to put off that pesky paper, look no further. Here are five brands born and bred in sunny Los Angeles to prepare you for a hot next couple of months. 
OGBFF: 
Reinstate the baby tee as this summer’s staple
Short for Original Best Friend Forever, OGBFF is barely a year old and already making waves across influencer pages. Designers Angela Ruis and Lauren Schiller run the brand entirely out of a bedroom, where they got their start selling on the independent reselling app, Depop. 
After gaining almost 30,000 followers on Instagram and almost instantly selling out on their weekly Depop drops, the pair recently broadened their influence by publishing their first website. They specialize in unabashed early 2000s nostalgia and ironic baby tees, some of the most popular styles in L.A. this past year. Their most popular designs feature bold text exclaiming “HOT PERSON AT WORK” or “FLOP ERA,” each for 40 to 45 dollars, depending on the style you choose. Between their tees, micro skirts and sweat shorts, you can concoct an outfit that will make you feel confident and inspire a lot of double-takes. 
Angel Moon:
Dreamy pieces you can spend every sunny day in
Founded only weeks before the pandemic in 2020, Angel Moon has slowly but surely gained a large dynamic following due in part to their large online shopping presence being pushed center stage since the start of quarantine. The brand has frequently shifted their creative direction upon inception to match the everchanging aura of L.A., but has remained consistent in their prices and is open to all customers’ price ranges throughout these changes, with custom tank tops as low as twenty dollars. 
Recently, Angel Moon has prioritized incorporating sets with faintly acid-washed fabrics complete with dainty symbols and shapes. The designer makes a case for arm warmers to come back again (a move only the fashionably bold would take on during the hottest months of the year), meticulously matching them with the ethereal and fairy-like patterns of the tanks and pants also found on the website. Worn by Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid, this brand will only grow in popularity as it reaches its genuine style and creative approach. 
Tootsie Jewelry:
Add a little pizzazz to your bikinis or beach fits
This jeweler is a perfect excuse to pile on the accessories before you walk out the door. Tootsie, a two-year-old company, specializes in making necklaces, waist chains, bracelets and more for every aesthetic or style, never straying too far from the 70 dollar price mark. Each item can exist as a statement piece on its own, with chunky gold hearts or a string of perfectly mismatched charms that shimmer and sparkle in the L.A. sunshine. But the secret to the craft is being bold enough to layer the most antipodal pieces on top of one another, purposely clashing to compress chaos into one outfit. 
Left Hand L.A.: 
Go against the sundress and jean short norms
Self-proclaimed as the “founding mothers of DIY fashion,” two actual lefties established this brand in 2012 and have now seen it grow a cult-like following as it reaches its ten-year anniversary, gaining traction with the more alternative side of L.A. street style. 
Virtually every piece listed on their website features a unique, DIY element, whether it be interesting added safety pins, unique ironed-on patches or full teddy bears sewn onto collars or pockets. Most of the additives are nods to nostalgic pop culture moments, such as “The Parent Trap,” “The Shining” and “Rugrats.” Because each article is a handmade one-of-a-kind piece of clothing, the pricing for this brand usually settles more towards the hundred dollar mark. The loud, chaotic mixture of elements of each piece has proven to be popular amongst celebrities, as well, seeing that Billie Eilish has been an avid patron of the small clothing company for years. 
Moonkissed Collective: 
For those hoping for a Summer of Love
This brand is aimed directly at the hopeless romantics, specifically those who want to stay as Instagrammable as possible while still dressing for the L.A. heat. For instance, their most popular item (thanks to its status as a popular overnight TikTok sensation) is a thin tank top lovingly highlighting an intimate love letter showered in lipstick kisses. Other popular tees showcase JFK, and Jackie O. immortalized within a gold heart-shaped locket, as well as other representations of love and loss, embellished with dainty bows and lacey trims, all between 40 to 45 dollars each. What’s more, Moonkissed is very graphic-designer friendly, intending to be a space to support and uplift Gen Z designers. In short, if you love love, you’ll fall in love with this label. 
These are just a fraction of the bountiful and beautiful designers L.A. has to offer. Hopefully, this inspires you to dive down a rabbit hole of online retail therapy. Happy shopping!

This review contains spoilers.
In an early scene of Hulu’s new original miniseries “The Dropout,” a young Elizabeth Holmes (Amanda Seyfried) happily dances around her bedroom in front of a poster of Steve Jobs. She gazes up at her idol with an expression that begins as awe but shifts into something with more intent, belying a preternatural determination masked by her teenage exterior. Holmes wants more than anything for the world to perceive her as a genius like Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg, but the first three episodes, which premiered March 3, suggest that the cultural canonization of a genius is determined more by image than ability.
The series is based on a popular ABC News podcast that recounted the meteoric rise and ignominious fall of wunderkind entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the now infamous biotechnology company Theranos, which misled millions with revolutionary at-home blood testing devices that were revealed to be nonfunctional. 
The journalistic basis of the series lends credibility to the incredible mini-series onscreen proceedings. Additionally, the facts are displayed incredibly clearly and methodically in this extreme dramatization while not sacrificing important character development and narrative arc. 
Since her highly public trial, Holmes has come to embody a cartoonish image in the public perception: an absurdly camp comedic cross of Steve Jobs-esque black turtlenecks, clownish hair and makeup styling that would rival the Joker and, of course, that infamous, affectedly deep voice. Show creator Elizabeth Meriweather is less interested in poking fun at this caricature in what could doubtlessly have been an entertaining farce instead choosing to delve into this fascinating personality with an empathetic approach that encourages fan identification with Holmes without endorsing her actions.
In “The Dropout,” Holmes, even as a high schooler, voices her desire to be a billionaire but also claims to want to change the world for the better. The series deftly explores the extreme contradicting pulls of altruistic intention and monetary demands. The second episode is filled with exciting scenes of Theranos’ attempts to court signifcant funding from venture capitalists and pharmaceutical companies and the writing wisely employs montage sparingly, favoring grounded scene work instead. 
The story of Elizabeth Holmes, as dramatized in “The Dropout,” is, at intervals, entertaining and thought-provoking during the first three episodes of what will be an eventual eight-episode long miniseries but would have translated better as a feature film. 
The narrative too often rambles rather than races, the pilot in particular drags and each episode offers only a few truly potent, nail-biting scenes apiece amid the tepid contextual details that make up the rest of the episode. Anyone who has seen “The Social Network,” a similar tragedy of a socially inept would-be tech god, will miss the breakneck pacing and pressure-cooker high intensity that can be achieved more readily in the film format.
The ever-radiant Seyfried is not an obvious choice for the generally unkempt Holmes. Unfortunately, her winsome movie star appeal at times undermines the interesting scrappy underdog quality that made Holmes such an unexpected success. Frankly, she’s a bit too pretty, but despite the initial shock of seeing a former Plastic of “Mean Girls” fame playing an awkward wallflower, Seyfried sells it. 
Her vocal work imitating Holmes’ mannerisms is variable, noticeably dipping in and out depending on the scene.  But Seyfried was tasked with the difficult job of imitating Holmes’ odd voice. Still, the shows emotional characterization of a fundamentally insecure, young woman is believable and stays consistent throughout. She wonderfully captures the character’s iconic fumbling awkwardness; in early interactions with peers as a student at Stanford, her inability to connect with others offers an explanation for, or perhaps rather a symptom of, her ravenous ambition.
A large supporting cast elevates Seyfried’s anchoring performance; a mixture of familiar television faces like Laurie Metcalf, Elizabeth Marvel and William H. Macy and equally capable, lesser-known actors, such as standout Nicky Endres — who brings needed shrewdness and sympathy to a small part — fill out the increasingly disgruntled orbit around Holmes. The ensemble provides comic relief through kooky yet very believable characterizations as well as emotional heft in seeing how the unlikely leader Holmes won over people of all sorts, from her parents and professors to investors and cancer patients, all with huge dreams and each recieving sky-high promises.
While Holmes herself never lived up to the persona she created for the world, the series’ deconstruction of this image it makes for a compelling exploration of the myth making that goes into constructing a genius. Can you change the world without changing who you are?
Rating: 3/5
