A recent study found that students who engage in “pregaming” are more likely to experience negative consequences associated with drinking than those who do not drink before going out, largely because students who pregame drink more alcohol than those who do not engage in such activities.
The term “pregaming,” also called pre-loading or pre-drinking, describes the act of drinking alcohol before going out for the night. Addiction experts believe that somewhere between 65 and 75 percent of college-age people engage in pregaming.
The study, which surveyed 250 students over five weeks, found that students who drank before going out consumed an average of seven drinks per night, while students who solely drank at a bar, club or party consumed only four.
Students who pregamed were more likely to experience blackouts and engage in unprotected sex or unplanned drug use. They were also more likely to obtain injuries.
Steven Sussman, a professor of preventive medicine and pyschology, said the study’s findings were not surprising because of the effects of alcohol.
“Neocortical inhibition of limbic function is lessened, which could lead to relatively impulsive behavior,“ Sussman said.
Students who engaged in pre-gaming had a 24 percent chance of a night ending with negative consequences, while those who did not pre-game but drank while out had only an 18 percent chance of mishaps.
Jared Brow, a freshman studying international relations and global business, said pre-gaming is part of USC’s culture, but that he is not particularly concerned by it.
“While pre-gaming does occur, it’s definitely not unique to our school,” Brow said. “If you want to pre-game, you can find people to do that with … [but] people aren’t pressed into doing it.”
Other students, such as Maya Cave, a sophomore studying comparative literature and French, said pre-gaming is an important aspect of USC’s party scene.
“Pre-gaming is big because people use it as a way to feel more comfortable in new or awkward social situations,” Cave said.
Pre-gaming has only recently begun to be studied by scientists, so its effects are still largely unknown.
Sussman noted the levels of consumption reported are alarming.
“Seven drinks over the evening is like drinking over half a pint of vodka, over a bottle of wine, [or] more than a six-pack of beer,” he said.
Such drastic consumption is also indicative of larger problems.
“Preloading, particularly if hidden from others, is a sign of a pending drinking problem,” Sussman said.
He also noted that four drinks is still over the Department of Health and Human Service’s recommended intake, which allows two drinks per day for men and one for women as a safe limit.
Despite its risks, many students choose to pre-game and likely will continue to pre-game. The study cited motivations including saving money, making contact with potential hook-ups, socializing and getting in the mood to party.
Sussman said that college-age drinking tends to be tolerated as “a right of passage to adulthood,” promoted by movies like Animal House and The Hangover, though he was wary of this acceptance.
“Even four drinks … can be consequential,” he said. “Seven drinks definitely is dangerous.”
The kids of this generation don’t know how to drink.   The problem is no one teaches them anymore.
Man, do old farts like you have so little to do or care about that you have to mock the newer generations on dumb criteria like this (not to mention on a college newspaper)? It’s as dumb as “my dad could beat up your dad.”
I won’t fight you or your dad physically though I appreciate the offer.  Those days of fighting for me are over.  I fought long and hard for this country starting in Korea as man (not a child) of your age.   You’ll never understand or appreciate watching good men, sometimes your buddy, die for their country in some far away place.
1. You don’t know that – you don’t even know who I am or what I do.
2. What does this have to do with my original question or this article?
3. I’m sorry you feel the need to make yourself feel better by bashing this generation on stupid criteria, on a college newspaper no less.
4. I’m sorry you’re so irascible that you feel the need to troll in general.

From 1979 to 1982, Arie Kapteyn worked as an assistant and associate professor of economics at USC.
Kapteyn ultimately left for a professorship in the Netherlands, but said he just couldn’t stay away from the University Park Campus: Effective Thursday, Kapteyn will serve as the director of a new research center focusing on economics.

“There is a little bit of sentiment,” Kapteyn said. “When I was at USC before, I had a really good time and really enjoyed my experience. It is sort of nice to come back to USC, even though it has changed and grown quite a bit.”
Kapteyn added that the excitement of new changes on campus was a big draw for him.
“There’s a lot going on,” he said. “I really like the current leadership -— it seems to be very open to new things and very entrepreneurial.”
As director of the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, Kapteyn’s first duties will be getting the new research institute off the ground in terms of finances and hiring.
“I found that to create a really good research center there’s always one thing that dominates everything else -— you have to hire the best possible people and then provide them with the best possible support,” Kapteyn said.
One of the first things the management will have to work on is an official opening date for the center; Kapteyn said he hopes to open the center by spring at the latest.
Another goal of the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research is to create more opportunities for interdisciplinary research.
“USC is a really big university with a number of really good departments in a number of different schools,” Kapteyn said. “I hope to make many connections with many school departments about things we can do together.”
Kapteyn’s background at RAND, a Santa Monica-based non-profit policy and decision-making think tank, provided him with experience and leadership in economics-related research. Before coming to USC, Kapteyn was not only a senior economist and the director of RAND Labor & Population, but also served as director of the Roybal Center for Financial Decisionmaking and associate director of the Financial Literacy Center. He also taught at the Pardee RAND Graduate School, where he advised 25 doctoral candidates on their theses.
Kapteyn said that at USC, he will be utilizing the same research methods and skills he used at RAND.
“In my current position, most of my time is research and it’s going to stay that way,” Kapteyn said. “That’s the only way I want to do it … I think you’re more effective when you do research yourself. I wouldn’t want to just be a manager.”
Kapteyn will continue researching his favorite topic — aging and its relationship to financial behavior.
“I want to understand what an aging population means, how people age now and how they age differently than they did in the past,” Kapteyn said. “There are implications for how long they can work or how much money they’ll need when they retire.”
Kapteyn is also regarded as an expert in microeconomics, econometrics and public finance.
Steve A. Kay, dean of the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said in a statement that Kapteyn’s expertise will help the university and economics department improve its academic reputation.
“Arie Kapteyn’s wealth of experience shows he has the skills and talent to continue to propel social sciences research at USC Dornsife to new heights with the founding of the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research,” Kay said.

In a discussion ranging from Charlie Chaplin to President Barack Obama, Steven J. Ross, a professor of history at USC, delved into the intersection of politics and celebrity. Ross discussed this trend in his latest book Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics on Wednesday at the second event of the Provost’s Writers Series.
Celebrity politics · History professor Steven J. Ross discusses his most recent book, Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics, at the second event of the Provost’s Writers Series on Wednesday. Ross focused on the role of celebrities in American politics. – Alex Rose | Daily Trojan
Ross said his interest in writing the book stemmed from his concern with the fate of democracy and its erosion in the 20th and 21st centuries.
“My idea was, in order to get people to understand the politics, why not write about movie stars and through their story, tell the story of politics?” Ross said.
According to Ross, movie stars have influenced the ways in which we think about politics for over 100 years. One example of this influence, Ross said, was Charlie Chaplin’s use of visual politics.
“[Chaplin] can put it directly on the screen where it can be both seen and potentially acted on by millions of people,” Ross said.
According to Ross, Chaplin mocked authority figures through his roles, which included police officers, judges and world leaders. Ross said because Chaplin was a movie star, audiences listened to him.
Ross asserts his book differs from many previous viewpoints in that he argues Hollywood stars have had a greater impact on right-wing politics than left-wing politics.
Citing President Ronald Reagan and Sen. George Murphy — both actors turned politicians — Ross said that the Republican Party was more greatly influenced by movie stars than was the Democratic Party.
Ross said he believes there are flaws with celebrities running for office: They’re not always qualified, but voters won’t look completely into their platforms because they are blinded by their esteem.
“In the end, Schwarzenegger’s story highlights differences between a celebrity who knows how to run for office and a politician who knows how to govern in office,” Ross said.
According to Ross, as a result of celebrities in politics, voters have become more concerned with a candidate’s image and ability to communicate rather than their ideals.
Regardless of whether or not Ross agreed with famous individuals taking political action, he acknowledged their power and ability to command overwhelming amounts of attention in civil movements and politics.
“As Barack Obama has shown in 2008 and John Kennedy before him, politicians who become celebrities have a better chance of governing effectively than celebrities who become politicians,” Ross said.

Though the fault lines of state building in today’s post-Taliban Afghanistan might seem difficult to comprehend to some,  USC Adjunct Associate Professor of Anthropology Gabriele Rasuly-Paleczek shed light on the challenges the Middle Eastern nation faces in a late Wednesday afternoon lecture.
Rasuly-Paleczek explored reasons behind the current plight of international and national efforts to stabilize the country and proposed possible solutions for the road that lies ahead.
“In the West, but also within Afghanistan and neighboring countries, people are quite puzzled that despite more than a decade of efforts to stabilize the country … nothing could really be achieved,” Rasuly-Paleczek said. “Beginning with the bond process in 2001, which highlighted the idea of recreating a highly centralized Afghan state, this model is totally inadequate … From my perspective, using this model of centralized state already is a type of malconception. It does not take into account that Afghanistan has changed.”
Afghanistan has led a tumultuous history leading up to present day, from early Islamization and the Mongol invasion to dynastic cycles to the Soviet war, civil war and now, the end to a decade-long U.S.-led war.
Despite the nation’s troubled history, Rasuly-Paleczek said she believes that a stable future is possible.
“A balancing of power can best be achieved not by a centralized model, but a federative system to give more voice to the various regions of the country,” Rasuly-Paleczek said.
However, according to Rasuly-Paleczek, a federative model was never taken into account because of the tradition of a strong state.
“Despite all the problems, I think an amendment of the constitution is necessary,” Rasuly-Paleczek  said. “We must find, in order to solve this problem, trust-building and concrete resolution mechanisms on several levels. But there are different approaches. Some are saying that the regions should be involved. Others are saying it should be people who are outside this whole conflict, but it should not be Iran or Pakistan.”
There are changes that have occurred over time that must also be taken into account as Afghanistan continues to build its state, Rasuly-Paleczek added.
“At the end of the 19th century, both superpowers at that time agreed on Afghanistan being a vassal state, whereas now, it’s not clear … Iran and, in particular, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia could play a role, and that was not the case in the 19th century,” Rasuly-Paleczek said. “People are yearning for peace and recently, putting aside conflicts, like tabula rasa.”
For freshman international relations major Luke Phillips, stability is an almost unattainable concept in the current political state of Afghanistan.
“The way things have been going on right now, regardless of what kind of sentiments that people want to have happen, I think the forces of history are just too strong,” Phillips said. “I suppose if there is a holistic government involving the Taliban, then that would bring more stability then they’ve had since 2001, but I don’t think there would be sufficient democracy-building.”
Others, including Professor of Anthropology Erin Moore, remain hopeful for the region.
“There are a lot of countries that are just as diverse, like India, that have come from a place of many separate kingdoms, and they were able to come together into a peaceful nation,” Moore said. “Just because [Afghanistan’s] so diverse and has a history of diverse kingdoms doesn’t mean that it can’t be a nation-state in the near future.”
For Lynn Matthews, an attendee of the lecture, the potential solutions are a confirmation of what the Afghan population hopes for. Matthews visited Afghanistan in September, and said she saw the people’s desire to find peace firsthand.
“The one continuous theme in every school that I visited, from Mazar-e-Sharif to Jalalabad, they wanted peace, and you know, I told these kids, you guys are the future of Afghanistan,” Matthews said. “I just want to believe, and I hope and pray that if we could encourage more education there, it’s going to pull people out of this militant thing going on and make them focus on education, stopping this war and moving on to live in peace.”

Now this is more like it. USC and UCLA will square off on Saturday in college sports’ greatest crosstown rivalry, and provided the college football fans can wake up early enough to catch the noon kickoff time, more eyes will be on this game than in recent years because of what’s at stake.
The Pac-12 South division will be decided, with each team’s Rose Bowl hopes still very much at play.
A notable amount of national media attention has escalated this week, and the rest of the college football nation is paying attention. For all those outside the greater Southern California area anxiously awaiting this showdown, I have one question.
What took you so long?
This year’s edition of the rivalry feels different, in part because, well, it is. Each team is ranked heading into the big game for the first time since 2005, and the Bruins are ranked ahead of the Trojans for the first time since 2001.
Meetings in both these years saw USC destroy UCLA, and though I’m sure Trojan fans have reveled in USC’s dominance over the last 13 years (12 wins for USC), the rest of the country has grown bored of it.
Because honestly, is it really a rivalry when the teams aren’t even close to the same caliber?
The simple answer is no, but in reality this rivalry doesn’t need both teams to be competitive to be special. Because of the schools’ unmatched close proximity, battles are fought every day between fans of both sides, whether at school, work or in any other part of the community.
Each fan base is so interconnected that interaction is constant.
Compare this to other classic rivalries, such as Auburn-Alabama and Ohio State-Michigan, where the opposing schools are more than 150 miles apart.
Sure, each annual meeting is a big deal, but what about the other 364 days of the year? In Los Angeles, every day is game day, and the bickering and chatter that make sports so fun is non-stop.
Beyond the fan base component to the rivalry is the storied history that these two schools share.
Saturday’s game shapes up to be yet another iconic moment in a rivalry that already has plenty to show for itself.
Before last year’s LSU-Alabama game that was dubbed the “Game of the Century,” there was the 1967 meeting between the Bruins and the Trojans that was one of the “Games of the Century,” with USC ranked No. 4 and UCLA undefeated and ranked No. 1.
Led by OJ Simpson, the Trojans won in comeback fashion 21-20 and went on to win the national championship in one of the greatest games in college football history.
Or in 1988, when No. 2 USC, led by quarterback Rodney Peete, and No. 6 UCLA, led by quarterback Troy Aikman, met to determine who would represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.
In front of 100,741 fans at the Rose Bowl (a regular-season record), USC prevailed 31-22. Peete and Aikman finished second and third, respectively, in Heisman trophy voting behind Barry Sanders.
Perhaps the most memorable game in recent memory, much to the chagrin of USC fans, is the 2006 meeting between the No. 2 Trojans and the unranked Bruins at the Rose Bowl, where Karl Dorrell’s defense shut down John David Booty and the vaunted USC offense to knock USC out of the BCS national championship game.
One of the biggest upsets in college football history is also UCLA’s only win in the series since 1998.
But back to the game this weekend. Yes, this rivalry will always be important, no matter what each team’s record is.
But though outsiders might have tuned out while USC racked up wins for the better part of the last decade, Trojan fans want nothing more than for this trend to continue.
I know the panic level on USC’s campus is a bit higher than normal.
But this kind of competition is a good thing. Because even though the game always means something here, it won’t matter outside of Southern California if both teams aren’t competitive.
So when Bruin fans are dreaming about halting a five-game losing streak in the rivalry and potentially earning a Rose Bowl bid, be happy, USC fans. All that means is more people are watching, which makes the game and the days leading up to it all the more fun.
In fact, we ought to rejoice in the Bruins’ success this season, because it’s not every year that this game makes such a big splash on the national scale.
With that being said, here’s to hoping for another 50-0 game.

When it comes to athletics, there’s arguably been no bigger thorn in USC’s side this season than Pac-12 rival Stanford. Though the football team suffered one of their three agonizing losses to their Bay Area foe in September, the USC women’s volleyball team succumbed to a Cardinal squad that is responsible for one of the team’s four losses on the season.

With the season winding down and the team gearing up for a deep postseason run, USC women’s volleyball will look to exact revenge this week, as it hosts the Cardinal on Thursday night and California on Friday for its final home matches of the regular season.
The Women of Troy (24-4, 12-4) return from a four-game road trip toting a three-game winning streak, having recorded victories over Arizona, Utah and Colorado to bounce back from a sweep by Arizona State.
“We’re really happy that we came out with two wins. The second week on the road is always difficult,” Haley said. “It’s a nice way to finish off the road trip with back-to-back wins, especially because Colorado played very well and fought us until the end.”
The bout with Stanford will likely be the toughest match yet for the Women of Troy, who suffered a 3-0 sweep early October in Palo Alto. No. 1 Stanford boasts a 24-2 overall record and a flawless 16-0 mark in Pac-12 play.
Regardless, the Women of Troy enter the match with considerable momentum, with wins against Utah and Colorado sealing a successful road trip. A balanced attack paved the way for the four-set victory (25-22, 15-25, 25-16, 25-23) over the Utes, as three players registered double-doubles. Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio continued her outstanding pace, notching 13 kills and 13 digs for her ninth double-double, while senior opposite Katie Fuller and junior outside hitter Sara Shaw each notched 13 kills and 10 digs.
Against the Buffaloes, the Women of Troy played their longest set of the season to start the match and prevailed 31-29 before dispatching of Colorado 25-19, 25-17 in the final two frames. Bricio again led the players offensively, this time recording 12 kills  along with eight digs. The Women of Troy also received important contributions from freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, who utilized more playing time to deliver six blocks and five kills, and Fuller, who turned in a complete performance with 11 kills, three service aces, and five block assists.
“I just wanted to keep encouraging them after the first set. We had several opportunities to win that earlier but it was difficult for us to play in the altitude,” Haley said. “We weren’t serving very well and allowed them to get 21 kills, but we still managed to come out with a win.”
As the team prepares for the season’s most important match, Haley recognizes the opportunity that awaits USC.
“Stanford is always a difficult team to play, regardless of venue,” Haley said. “It’s interesting because, like us, they also play a lot of freshmen. They play differently than we do, however, so we need to prepare for them adequately and maintain our focus.”

Point: UCLA’s high-powered recruiting and budding star quarterback Brett Hundley make the Bruins USC’s stiffest challenge going forward. 
The week leading up to the annual USC-UCLA football game is always chock-full of (mostly) friendly banter between the two schools. In recent seasons, the pregame narrative has involved the Trojans’ win streak against the Bruins and expectations for another easy USC win regardless of whether the venue is the Coliseum or the Rose Bowl.
But not this year.
UCLA is actually ranked higher than USC in the BCS standings for the first time in a while. The Bruins have one fewer loss than the Trojans and sit atop the Pac-12 South with an 8-2 record. And they enter Saturday’s crosstown matchup only two weeks removed from a 66-10 shellacking of an Arizona squad that beat the Trojans earlier in the season.
Whether Trojans fans want to admit it or not, the Rick Neuheisel era is over. New coach Jim Mora has done a masterful job of putting the Bruins back into contention, and there’s no reason to think that UCLA won’t be USC’s chief rival in the Pac-12 South for the foreseeable future.
There’s almost no possible rationale to lead college football viewers to assume this season is a fluke for UCLA. Other than a bizarre blowout loss against the Golden Bears on Oct. 6 — akin to USC’s 43-22 defeat at the hands of the Sun Devils in 2011 — the Bruins have taken care of business against a wide variety of opponents. Their schedule hasn’t been as challenging as USC’s thus far, but with matchups against the Trojans and Cardinal coming up, the Bruins could put themselves in the conversation to be a top-10 BCS team.
Even in the more realistic scenario in which UCLA falls to USC and/or Stanford, it will still be leaps and bounds ahead of where it previously was. The Bruins have a redshirt freshman quarterback, Brett Hundley, who has thrown for 2,739 yards to go with 24 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He also has nearly 300 rushing yards and an additional six touchdowns. Assuming Hundley only gets better, the Bruins automatically have a leg up on most of the Pac-12 South with an established quarterback capable of putting up big numbers.
The loss of senior running back Johnathan Franklin after the season obviously hurts, but it’s not a deal-breaker. The Bruins have a deep recruiting class coming in, currently ranked No. 18 in the country according to ESPN. That pales in comparison to USC, currently ranked No. 1, but it is ahead of Pac-12 teams such as Washington (No. 19) and even Oregon (No. 23).
That influx of talent, coupled with a weak group of opponents in the Pac-12 South makes UCLA the easy choice to become USC’s top competitor moving forward. Arizona is set to lose senior quarterback Matt Scott and will have to fall back on star running back Ka’Deem Carey. Though still capable of staying afloat, the Wildcats have been incredibly inconsistent in coach Rich Rodriguez’s first season in Tucson. He’s done an admirable job of getting Arizona in the mix against ranked opponents, but that rebuilding process needs a little more time.
Arizona State, meanwhile, hasn’t posted a winning record since 2007, and Utah and Colorado are still working out the kinks to keep up in the Pac-12.
That means UCLA is the de facto choice here. I’m not convinced the Bruins are capable of upending USC in their individual matchup, this year included, but that doesn’t mean they won’t post a similar record on a yearly basis. And considering how lopsided the battle for Los Angeles has been in recent years, maybe a little parity is just what’s needed to spice this rivalry up again.
Counterpoint: Despite UCLA’s successful season, Arizona and Arizona State are better positioned to challenge USC because of their proven coaching.
At present, it would be difficult to argue that a team other than UCLA poses the biggest threat to USC going forward in the Pac-12 South, primarily because UCLA currently sits alone at first place in the division. The two teams will battle it out this weekend to decide who will go to the conference championship game, but beyond that, has this division become a two-horse race between the Bruins and the Trojans? Hardly.
What has UCLA done to warrant the honor of being USC’s most significant challenger in the South going forward? Other than posting an undefeated record in divisional play and accruing a ranking one spot higher than USC in the BCS, not much. On the surface, it seems like these two teams are set to duke it out over the course of the next few years to assert dominance over the division, but I wouldn’t be so quick to discount the South’s other teams.
Coming into this season, UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State were all breaking in new coaches, and expectations were relatively low heading into 2012. After 12 weeks of football, it appears that each new coach has his team on the right track, as they have all exceeded expectations. UCLA and Arizona are both bowl eligible, and Arizona State, which started 5-1, should earn eligibility this week with a win against a woeful Washington State team. The Sun Devils have also addressed disciplinary and team chemistry issues that plagued the team a year ago. All three programs appear to be headed in the right direction, but the question is: Which team’s success is the most sustainable?
The answer is not UCLA. One thing the Arizona schools have that UCLA doesn’t is a head coach with a record of building a successful program. Arizona State coach Todd Graham sported a 36-17 record and three bowl victories in his four seasons at Tulsa, and finished his last season with the school ranked No. 24 in the Associated Press poll. Despite Arizona State’s current four-game losing streak, the team does not appear to be falling apart like last season’s team did. The effort is not lacking, and Graham appears to have successfully changed the culture that was left in former coach Dennis Erickson’s wake.
Arizona’s Rich Rodriguez has an even more impressive resume. In 2001, his first season as coach of West Virginia, the Mountaineers went 3-8. After that, Rodriguez’s squad never posted fewer than eight wins in a season, and in his final three years in Morgantown his team won two BCS bowl games and finished in the top 10. His tenure at Michigan was nowhere near as successful, but that could be attributed in part to the incredible amount of pressure that the Michigan job entails. Though the people of Tucson love their Wildcats, Ann Arbor is in a completely different league in terms of college football fervor.
This brings us to UCLA and first-year head coach Jim Mora. Mora’s track record as a head coach is brief: He’s coached four seasons in the NFL as a head coach (three with Atlanta and one with Seattle). During that span, his team’s record worsened each season. The Falcons went 11-5 in 2004, but went 8-8 and 7-9 the next two seasons before Mora was eventually fired. After a 5-11 season with the Seahawks, Mora was fired again. In addition, Mora has a shown a penchant for shooting his mouth off, as evidenced by his insensitive and ignorant comments following the tragic shootings near USC’s campus last summer and his more recent remarks after an apparent USC fan posed as a UCLA player on Twitter. Those kinds of slip-ups are tolerable when your team is 8-2. But on a struggling team? Athletic directors have been known to have far less patience.
I know the Bruins are undefeated in the Pac-12 South, including an annihilation of Arizona, but each of these new coaches was hired to change the culture of their respective teams and to create sustainable, consistent success. Rodriguez and Graham have shown they can do that; Mora has not as much. This season, I would argue that USC’s biggest threat in the Pac-12 South has been itself, but going forward, I’ll put my money on the two coaches who have proven themselves rather than the guy who believes a Twitter imposter should be imprisoned.

The feedback that I’ve had on my column has been mostly positive, which is heartwarming, but I’ve realized that I have spent the bulk of the last few weeks writing for the singleton looking for love, sex and everything in between. I in no way regret this decision, and as a singleton myself I think that we do need a little attention every now and then. But I also think I’ve done a disservice by neglecting a huge segment of the student population: The couples.
This isn’t because I hate being in relationships — it’s actually quite the opposite. It’s just difficult to give advice to people who are already considered lottery winners.
Being in a relationship is quite simply the best feeling in the world, and anyone who tells you otherwise is either kidding themselves or has never been in one. Yes, I believe that you need to be happy on your own before you’re happy with someone else, and no, I don’t think that you need to actively pursue being with someone — anyone — just for the sake of being in a relationship. But when it finally happens with the right person, love can make a believer out of anyone.
So how does one even maintain a successful relationship in college? Well, there’s no one answer. But these four tips will certainly set you well on your way.
Time, After Time
Though ’SC can sometimes feel like the best vacation ever, the bulk of us have more work and extra-curriculars than the average American adult. Greek life, crew team, engineering club — it often seems we’re everywhere at once, which is great for our resumes but horrible for our relationships.
When you’ve decided to take the plunge and date that special someone, it’s important to block out time for them. Seems easy enough, right? Wrong. Most of us barely have enough time to sleep and stay sane, let alone take someone out on a date or give them a backrub at the end of the night.
Ambition is sexy, and the fact that you have your own thing going on is probably a turn-on for your counterpart, but spending even a little bit of time with them is imperative. Try scheduling a date night at least once a week. During this time, turn off the phone — an almost impossible feat for myself — and spend time being just you two. Whether it’s going out to dinner or even staying in and watching TV, it’s of utmost importance that you make time for each other.
Independence Day
Now don’t mistake “spend time with each other,” for “spend every moment together.” There’s nothing more annoying and vomit-inducing than that couple who can’t spend a second apart. Come on, codependence is so not sexy.
The biggest mistake that most college students make in relationships is thinking that because you don’t have mommy and daddy breathing down your neck, sleepovers every night are awesome. Trust me, nothing is worse for your sanity or theirs. You need to know how to sleep in a bed alone. You need to be able to apply your acne cream every now and then. You need to be able to hang out with your actual roommate.
Instead, decide what nights you are going to go to their place and what nights he or she is going to come to yours. My favorite method is the two-two-three rule. You spend two nights a week at their place, they spend two nights a week at yours, and you each spend three nights by yourself. That way, you still get to spend time with them without feeling like you’re going to go crazy.
Just Shut Up and Take It
This might be a hard pill for some to swallow: While in a fight, if you feel like the argument is getting nowhere whatsoever, just lie down and wag your tail. Seriously, I know it might be difficult to back down from your opinion, but if this fight is a stalemate, it’s honestly easier just to give it to the other person.
What do I mean by this? Well, let’s say your significant other wants to go to the ballet. You hate ballet. What are you going to do? Go to the ballet. And you don’t just go, you smile, and you act like it’s the greatest thing since Halo was released. You love this person, so do what makes them happy.
Your significant other could be clearly in the wrong, but if you’re hurting their feelings, stop doing it no matter what. Just grin and take it — it’s a lot easier than trying to painfully hash it out in an argument that’s going absolutely nowhere.
Forever and Always
I often get asked by those in relationships what my quintessential piece of advice is, and I always quote Will Smith, which hopefully doesn’t make me lose any credibility: “What I found is divorce just can’t be an option.”
Think about it: If you take breaking up out of the equation, you will always be willing to work through whatever problems might arise. Of course, the larger issues like cheating and dangerous drug addictions might cause you to reevaluate, but if you both believe you’re in it for the long haul, you will want to solve the little problems without the fear of the other walking away.
So buckle up and realize that usually nothing is too big to fix. Look at the other person and remember why you wanted to be in a relationship with them to begin with. Sure, it was mostly because you didn’t want them boinking other people. But it was also because you admire, respect and can’t get enough of them. They’re your best friend and lover, and you’re in it for keeps.

With her latest album, Paradise, Lana Del Rey plays with character just as much as she continues to develop her signature sound.
The indie-pop artist — real name Elizabeth Grant — maintains the 1960s American girl persona she created on January’s Born to Die. But now, she’s abandoned themes of comfortable suburbia in favor of embracing the open road and personal liberation, all while preserving her hazy, atmospheric tone.
Paradise, which fans can purchase as a solo CD or as a joint album with Born to Die, features eight new songs, each expressing a different facet of Del Rey’s interpretation of a commercial ’60s era. With songs named “Cola,” “American” and “Bel Air,” Del Rey delivers an acceptable follow-up to an album that contained tracks titled “Blue Jeans” and “Diet Mountain Dew.” If some critics objected to Del Rey’s overly affected personality, they can’t accuse her of inconsistency.
Fans of Born to Die will immediately notice a striking musical similarity between Paradise’s tracks. Whereas Del Rey’s debut album sported a noticeable dynamic as the artist jumped between fast-paced songs, such as “Off to the Races” and “National Anthem,” and slower numbers, like “Million Dollar Man” and “Video Games,” Paradise maintains a sharp continuity. Every track presents the listener with the same drowsy tone and dragging tempo.
But Del Rey’s latest album isn’t monotonous. Instead, Paradise flaunts one cohesive sound, which Del Rey probes and examines just as much as she nostalgically explores multiple elements of ’60s Americanism.
“Ride,” the album’s first single, kicks Paradise off with mumbled, sustained vocals underscored by a progressive piano line. Del Rey’s drawling alto reaches new depths as she groans, “I been out on that open road / But you can be my full time daddy white and gold.” As a percussion beat picks up, moody orchestral strings supplement Del Rey’s breathy exhalation of the chorus’ line “I just ride,” which the listener soon realizes is her mantra for the rest of the album.
Del Rey explores this unrestrained liberation on tracks like “American.” Whereas Born to Die chronicled brutal love and simple romance as Del Rey sang lines such as “You said I was the most exotic flower / holding me tight in our final hour,” (“Million Dollar Man”) and “Do you think we’ll be in love forever?” (“Diet Mountain Dew”), Paradise focuses more on hedonism and sexual freedom. On “American,” Del Rey flaunts more of her signature patriotism as she describes a passionate encounter with an unknown lover: “You make me crazy, you make me wild / … like an American.” Lazy strings and pressing, half-spoken vocals enhance the fascinated tone behind the song’s detailed lyrics, evoking the sensation that the artist is fondly narrating past events as the distant memories return to her.
“Bel Air” and “Yayo” flaunt Del Rey’s admirable ability to capture multiple emotions at once. “Yayo,” mostly dominated by Del Rey’s raspy vocals, describes a desperate strip tease. “Let me put on a show for you, Daddy,” sings Del Rey, even as her quivering voice suggests discomfort and vulnerability. A similar balancing act occurs on “Bel Air.” As a pure, moving piano line echoes the innocence of a lullaby, Del Rey expresses restrained eagerness to greet an approaching lover. Despite the labored quality of the bass drums, Del Rey’s slowly ascending vocal line forces listeners to experience her anticipation.
“Body Electric” employs a similarly suspenseful rhetorical device. As she sings of Walt Whitman, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis, Del Rey’s sometimes-thin-sometimes-round alto describes her sexual yearnings while twanging guitars and rolling drums add tension to a song with an almost narrative arc.
But perhaps the most sexually liberated song on Paradise comes from “Gods and Monsters.” As a staticky intro builds to a syncopated chorus, Del Rey sings, “F-ck yeah give it to me / this is heaven, what I truly want / It’s innocence lost.” As religious imagery of angels, heaven and gods surround these carnal lyrics, it’s clear that Del Rey’s rebellion represents a sharp departure from her attitude on her former album. There are no messages of true, eternal love here.
It’s a shame that she’s sacrificed Born to Die’s subtlety to define her more liberated persona. “Cola,” which stands as one of Paradise’s more musically notable tracks, features a catchy, moving chorus and impressive vocalizing that suggests that Del Rey’s range is much wider than she’s letting on. But then the song startles the listener with unnecessarily vulgar lyrics. Though the album’s third track represents an attempt to color and shape her uninhibited persona, Del Rey’s metaphors seem extreme and overdone — especially with opening lines where she informs the listener that “[her] p-ssy taste like Pepsi cola.” Gross.
But even Del Rey’s minor lyrical setbacks don’t prevent the album from holding a title as one of the year’s best. With the bubbly pop soprano sounds of artists such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Ellie Goulding dominating airwaves, Del Rey’s determined alto and lower musical stylings add a welcome respite to shallow and predictable Top 40 hits.
The artist’s latest might not be paradise, but it’s awfully close.

Downtown on Ice
Thursday, Nov. 15 – Jan. 21
Pershing Square
532 S. Olive Ave.
It might not be Rockefeller Center, but an outdoor skating rink takes on more unique pleasures when surrounded by palm trees. The ice rink at Downtown’s Pershing Square opens to the public this Thursday, just in time for cooler temperatures and the holiday season.
Should you care to show off your figure skating skills — or perhaps train for the 2014 Winter Olympics — the rink will remain open until 10 p.m. every day of the week. If your figure-eights aren’t up to par, though, a one-hour skate session will only set you back $6.
 
Waiting for Jack: Poems of the Beat Era
Friday, Nov. 16 at 8 p.m.
Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center
Whether you’re preparing for the upcoming film adaptation of “On the Road” or are simply a longtime poetry fan, get thee to the Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center’s celebration of Jack Kerouac. Local poets will read the works of Kerouac and other Beats, as well as honor their own rebel spirits.
One never knows when Beyond Baroque will schedule a new event in its
irregular series nor are readers and readings revealed in advance. Given the popularity of these events, only one piece of information can be certain: arrive early.
 
The Misfits with The Attack
Sunday, Nov. 18 at 7:30 p.m.
Key Club
If Thursday’s Conquest events don’t satisfy your need for a good concert, check out The Misfits this Sunday evening at the Key Club in West Hollywood.
The horror punk band teams up with Rattlehead, The Scurvy Kids and The 40 Ouncers, among many other bands, for a rock extravaganza. And considering The Misfits’ 30 years of music industry experience, the collaborative concert should provide a satisfying blend of old and new.
At any rate, hits such as “Night of the Living Dead” and “Dig Up Her Bones” should please, as always.
Tickets are $25.
 
No Strangers: Ancient Wisdom in a Modern World
Saturday, Nov. 17 – Sunday, Feb. 24
Annenberg Space for Photography
The Annenberg Space for Photography, which has been closed for several weeks, reopens its doors this weekend for the grand opening of “No Strangers: Ancient Wisdom in a Modern World.”
Guest curated by anthropologist Wade Davis, “No Strangers” features the work of 24 photographers as they study different cultures from all over the world. Ultimately, the exhibit attempts to uncover the mysteries of shared experience and to understand the ambiguity of what it means to be human.

Christina Aguilera is done being a pop princess, and she wants the world to know it.
Wilting flower · Christina Aguilera has regained popularity because of The Voice. Her new album, though, fails to capitalize on her success. – Photo by Enrique Badulescu, courtesy of RCA Music Group
Her contemporaries have done the same: All one needs to do is look at Rihanna’s Good Girl Gone Bad reinvention or Britney Spears’ descent into “It’s Britney, b-tch” to see that the hottest new thing in pop music is to break all the rules.
And in order to do this, a certain recipe needs to be followed: Sing about drinking or partying, sing about sex and sing about how cool it is to be cool.
Aguilera burst onto the scene in the ’90s, dazzling the masses with her infectious cotton candy fluff. It’d be difficult to find a soul around today who cannot recite the lyrics to “Genie in a Bottle.”
But then one day, Aguilera decided to get dirty and released Stripped, the album that showed the world just how grown-up she had become (and how good she looks in leather chaps).
In recent years, Aguilera has become less known for her music and more for her personal life. And with her recent stint as a coach on the uber-popular singing competition show The Voice, her latest album Lotus should have been her claim back to legitimate fame. Unfortunately, the singer attempts to roar like a lion but only sounds like a mouse.
“Just a Fool” features her Voice colleague, country crooner Blake Shelton. Sometimes genre-hybrid songs make total sense — see Nelly and Tim McGraw’s collaboration on “Over and Over” — and other times, like in “Just a Fool,” the end result is just a mess. With lyrics like “Turn the music up a little bit louder / Just gotta get past the midnight hour,” the song easily falls into kitsch territory.
After listening to the first song, one might assume that the album will be all about heartbreak and moving on — after all, the songstress just ended a messy divorce and constantly deals with tabloid fodder about her weight. Unfortunately, Aguilera throws away such easy inspiration in favor of second-rate dance tunes, including one featuring her other Voice castmate Cee-Lo Green (“Make the World Move”). Some of these tunes are rather catchy, like the booty-shaking “Let There Be Love” and “Your Body,” but then others simply fall flat (“Army of Me”).
One bright spot is “Light Up the Sky,” a sort of Katy Perry-esque “Firework” that manages to showcase Aguilera’s bright vocals with a backing track that doesn’t drown her out with unnecessary beats. For a few brief minutes, you become almost transfixed by Aguilera’s mantra: “Wipe away the tears from our eyes / We’ll light up the sky / And we have wings we can fly / We can be kings you and I.” And when the chorus fades into soulful verses, one can only hope that Aguilera is getting in touch with her deeper side.
But that’s where the success ends. Pretty soon Aguilera is back to rhyming lyrics about no one getting the best of her.
Aguilera’s voice is too good to waste, but that’s all Lotus is: a waste of time, a waste of work, a waste of words. For some reason, Aguilera refused to rely on her golden voice in favor of dizzying arrangements and head-throbbing rhythms, something that, say, the equally talented and respected Adele would never do. Note to Aguilera: When your voice is that good, you don’t need all that added junk.
This is Lotus’ main dilemma. What kind of album does Aguilera want this to be? What exactly is she trying to say? There is no cohesive  narrative running throughout the whole album. She goes from being heartbroken to wanting to dance to hating those who hate her.
If only Aguilera came up with some idea — any idea — of what she was hoping to accomplish. It’s such a shame considering Aguilera’s voice reigns as one of the best of all time — and no one can dispute that. But if she continues to churn out music that dumbs her down, her spotlight will unfortunately be dimmed.
“Lotus” refers to not only a plant, but also a fruit in Greek mythology that makes the consumer forget anything that happened before eating it.
Ironically, you don’t need a lotus fruit to forget about Aguilera’s Lotus. The album takes care of that for you.
[…] The Lastest Lotus Flower Arrangements News       Posted on May 9, 2011 by        Aguilera offers little to love on Lotus Aguilera's voice is too good to waste, but that's all Lotus is: a waste of time, a waste of work, a waste of words.

Last week voters across the country approved measures that will change the face of American education.
Kate Wong | Daily Trojan
In California, Proposition 30 passed, allowing for a tax increase on the wealthiest Californians to fund K-12 schools as well as state colleges and universities. In Washington and Georgia, voters passed a law to allow charter schools to operate, leaving only eight states left who haven’t put a similar law into effect. In Maryland, the Maryland DREAM Act Referendum passed, allowing undocumented students who meet certain requirements to pay in-state tuition rates at Maryland public universities and community colleges.
Though Prop. 30 is the first general tax increase passed in two decades in California, though charter schools are still more experimental than an educational norm and though the federal DREAM Act has not officially been enacted, voters supported all of these measures. The fact Americans are willing to vote for the progressive and sometimes controversial solutions to our educational ills signals a shift in education reform that President Barack Obama must recognize and encourage in his second term.
For those who doubt the power these measures might carry for reform, it’s important to recognize the impact they have already had. Because Prop. 30 passed, the Cal State system already announced it would rescind a $249-per-semester tuition increase that began this fall. It also postponed action on increasing “incentive” fees for students who repeat courses or take more units than they need to graduate — fees that would raise an estimated $30 million in revenue, but at the cost of the educational experience of many students who need to retake courses or want to take more than a full load.
And thanks to Prop. 30, the Los Angeles United School District did not have to cut instruction days down. It would have become the district with the shortest school year in the country, but now has restored the district to its normal 180-day school year. The fact that Prop. 30’s tax increase was vehemently opposed by many Californians but still passed speaks to their commitment to saving our state’s schools — something Obama should continue to promote for the entire nation.
Fortunately, the president has already done so by recognizing the importance of charter schools, lauding them as “incubators of innovation” in a White House press release last May. As government-funded public schools that operate independently of public education regulations, charter schools are just that. They allow for creative instruction and provide options for parents and children at a time when public school quality and access are declining. And charter schools’ survival are based on student achievement — if they don’t meet certain achievement standards, they close — so they are far more committed to helping students do well. However, opponents decry that charter schools suck much needed money from public schools and that their effectiveness has yet to be proved.
Washington and Georgia’s new laws further demand that charter schools be officially incorporated into modern educational reform. Obama has stated his support of charter schools, but should be more vociferous about their benefits in order to remove their stigma as radical alternative schools.
But perhaps the most controversial change that took place last week was Maryland’s DREAM Act Referendum. Maryland joins 11 other states that have DREAM Acts, including California, but it is the first to pass the measure by popular vote. In a country with a struggling economy and educational system, this is truly progressive and something America needs more of.
It’s time to dispel the anti-immigration sentiment when it comes to students who are working equally — if not harder — to get an education and serve a country that, for most, has been their home their entire lives. And allowing undocumented students to attend college, and thus attain higher education and enter higher levels of the workforce, will only boost the economy.
There is no better way to accomplish all of this than for Obama to do everything within his power to officially pass the federal DREAM Act before his second term is over.
The 2012 election signals Americans are willing to take many steps forward on education that, even four years ago, they might have resisted. Obama must match this commitment and use his second term to push forward legislation that might be unpopular, controversial or not wholeheartedly supported, but will help save the future of American education.

In an article published Wednesday after the presidential election, The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof described the emerging fate of the Republican Party: “A coalition of aging white men is a recipe for failure in a nation that increasingly looks like a rainbow.”
There is no state where the GOP’s failure is more apparent than in California, where less than 30 percent of Californians registered as Republican this year, and state elections resulted in a Democratic supermajority in the legislature. At this rate, California might be running on a one-party system, which poses a serious threat to the welfare of its citizens.
This latest wave of Democratic success comes at a time when many Californians report dissatisfaction with Sacramento, citing continued high rates of unemployment. But despite the discontent, Republicans did not get elected. Democrats currently hold power in the governorship, and also every other statewide office and gained three more congressional seats last week, according to the Associated Press.
Republicans are unpopular in California largely because their conservative stances on social issues, such as immigration, abortion and gay rights, please their primary support base of white, conservative voters, but completely alienate the majority of Latinos, women and youth. This becomes especially detrimental for the GOP in a state where the population of Hispanics, blacks and Asians combined has outnumbered whites since 1998. In fact, by 2020, the Hispanic population alone is expected to top that of whites, according to the Associated Press.
But that does not mean that California — nor the nation — can survive with just one party. If anything, it necessitates a wider range of options of political leadership than the state currently has.
A major difference between Republicans and Democrats is the way they propose to handle the economic sector. If Californians are unhappy with the economy — the state boasts the third-highest unemployment rate in the country -— then voting a new party into power would be a logical conclusion. But as the most recent state election showed,  the GOP is so disconnected from citizens that this was not a viable option, demonstrating the biggest danger in a one-party system: the lack of opportunity for change.
Without multiple parties providing input and fighting for different sides of issues, progress within the state could be seriously hindered. With a supermajority in the legislature, Democrats are free to pass whatever measures they like; the two-thirds required for a vote would be nearly impossible for the opposition to secure. The U.S. government was founded on the principles of checks and balances and without them, democracy will not function as Americans need it to.
Many students, however, might see little reason to object to a Democratic majority in California. Nationally, over 60 percent of college-age people voted Democrat this election, according to the Pew Research Center. It is easy to believe that allowing the Democrats to essentially run the state government is simply a reflection of the people’s wishes. But what happens if the people change their minds, or the party they originally supported adopts an unfavorable platform while in office? When the government is saturated by one party, the most current desires of citizens cannot be fully expressed because there is much less diversity of opinion.
What is more concerning is the way in which California’s situation might serve as a precursor for the nation as a whole. The 2010 census found that for the first time ever, the birthrate of minority children is higher than that of Caucasian children. In about two decades, this means that voters will be primarily minority groups — groups that voted almost exclusively Democratic in the 2012 presidential election. According to exit polls, Obama won 93 percent of African-American voters’ support and more than 70 percent of Asians and Latinos.
Unless the GOP moderates and modernizes itself to appeal to a wider demographic, Californians and Americans across the nation will not be voting Republican anytime soon. It is crucial to have multiple parties providing input on how to govern the state and the nation, but if the GOP continues to be so disconnected from the interests of growing voting blocs, the possibility of a de-facto one-party system is not unrealistic.

Hurricane Sandy battered the East Coast with unparalleled ferocity, toppling houses, flooding streets and pulverizing hundreds of miles of coastline. Yet, amidst the brutality of the storm, small acts of kindness have bolstered individual morale to face the challenges ahead.
Government action plans are instrumental in disaster relief, but the altruism and warm hearts of community members are the true silver lining.
As snowstorm Athena swept in last week only days after Sandy devastated the Staten Island community of New York, 600,000 people in New York and New Jersey still remained without power, according to Time magazine. These circumstances rendered the snow, wind and cold deadly for many—if not for the efforts of community members to protect those at risk.
Within days of Sandy’s arrival in New York, the Hallowed Sons, a motorcycle club from Brooklyn, drove down to Staten Island to help people along Cedar Grove Avenue get back on their feet. The group cooked donated food, hauled supplies and patrolled the neighborhood for security. According to Time, the group has been serving 2,000 hamburgers and hot dogs daily.
Neighbors have been on the lookout for each other as well. One woman told Time that her entire community in Totenville banded together in the aftermath of the storm.
“You can buy a house, but you can’t buy your neighbors,” she told the magazine.
Jennite D’Ambrosio, another Staten Island resident, was pleasantly surprised when “a wave of volunteers descended on her neighborhood and helped her clean out her home for free.”
She had been on the lookout for services she could hire, but had been unable to find anyone willing to accept the price she was offering.
The case of Staten Island demonstrates that community can make a huge difference in the face of a brutal storm. Acts like cleaning houses for victims or passing out meals in the streets may seem small, but the magnitude of their power to move others is immeasurable.
Never underestimate the power of warm hearts—especially in the face of cold-hearted storms.

Marqise Lee, sophomore wide receiver for the Trojans, was named one of the 10 semifinalists for the Biletnikoff Award on Monday.
The Biletnikoff is given at the end of the season to the top wide receiver in college football. Lee is joined by fellow Pac-12 receivers Brandin Cooks of Oregon State and Austin Hill of Arizona. In his second season, Lee is leading the nation in receiving with 98 catches for 1,447 yards.
In USC’s 38-17 victory over Arizona State in the homecoming game, Lee provided several noteworthy moments among his 10 catches for 161 yards. One highlight was an 80 yard touchdown pass in which Lee hauled in a deep ball from senior quarterback Matt Barkley and outran two Sun Devils. Lee also broke off a 38-yard end-around by reversing direction behind the line of scrimmage.
Lee’s performance in the last four games has vaulted his name into the Heisman consideration, a rarity for wide receivers. The last player to win the Heisman who wasn’t a quarterback  or running back was Charles Woodson of Michigan in 1997. Desmond Howard of Michigan was the last wide receiver to take home the iconic trophy in 1991.

In light of the recent ballot box victories for same-sex marriage, the archaic definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman is obsolete.
Although the legal benefits of marriage make it appealing to tie the knot, the institution of marriage is unnecessary. While the decisions in Maine, Maryland and Washington undoubtedly represented a victory for same-sex couples, marriage is not needed to legitimize relationships.
In fact, marriage is on the decline nationwide. According to Pew Research Center polls, only half of all American adults are married, which is a decline from the 72 percent of the national population who were married in 1960.
Yet, America is far from a society of singles: cohabitation is on the rise among straight as well as gay couples, according to Pew Research Center. Instead of focusing on becoming legally married, many of today’s couples are creating lasting relationships without walking down the aisle.
And why should they have to? At its most basic level, a relationship is a bond formed between two people. It does not require acknowledgement through the fanfare of a wedding. Although a ceremony is a declarative sign of togetherness, it does not ensure a relationship’s success or longevity. In America, for example, over 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the eyes of the law, however, a marriage carries more weight. Legal boons such as social security benefits, joint tax filing and estate planning privileges make couples eager to get hitched.
Most states do not afford cohabiting partners these benefits. While the savvy couple can still arrange their assets to be mutually beneficial, some privileges, such as hospital visitation rights, cannot be mimicked. This antiquated system must change. In an age when marriage has lost its national significance, cohabiting couples should enjoy the same legal rights as married couples.
Despite the sentimentality associated with traditional weddings, the modern couple does not need a ceremony to solidify their bond and ensure their rights. Marriage is old-fashioned and redundant; it holds no sway over a couple or their place in society. Like the decoration on a wedding cake, it is merely ornamental.
Kind of a silly article.  While it is true that the number of people who are married is declining, the fact that 50% of American adults are married is a pretty clear indicator that it holds cultural and/or religious significance for a huge number of people.  Ms. An may not find any such significance for herself, and that’s fine, but she should not speak for the millions of people who feel otherwise.  In the past year, my own son has gotten married, as have several of his friends; the institution is far from dead.  And if Ms. An wants to cohabitate with somebody, get the state-granted benefits and protections that married people get, and do it all without the fanfare and walking down the aisle … she can get a civil marriage.  No matter what it’s called, if she wants those benefits from the state she will need to register with the state … as is the case for any state-granted benefits.  And that’s really all a civil marriage represents.  What she’s asking for already exists.
