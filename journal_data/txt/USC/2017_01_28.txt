We’ve been back at school for two and a half weeks, and it already feels like it’s been two months. On top of this, our next break isn’t until President’s Day Weekend,  and then a mere week off for Spring break. I’ll be the one to say it: This is a long time to be at school without the reassurance of knowing there is a week-long Thanksgiving break followed by a month-long winter break. Feeling frustrated yet? Don’t worry, I have answers. After all, this blog post is about making the most of your weekends — with a twist.
If you are like me and from Los Angeles, you most likely have already done all of the local “touristy” activities. Also, you know how tempting it is to go home for part of the weekend and enjoy the perks of your house (i.e. sleeping in your own bed). However, I encourage you to try something new to make your weekends seem like a mini vacation. This past weekend I traveled with a group of friends to San Clemente, Calif. We stayed at my friend’s house, went to the beach, tried new restaurants and relaxed and re-energized after a busy week at school. The best advice I can give an L.A. local is to go to a new place for a day (or the weekend if you have time). Whether it is surfing in San Clemente, lounging around in Laguna or poking around Palm Springs, create your own mini vacation to make the most of your weekend.
While taking a mini vacation away from Los Angeles is a great option, I also encourage everyone to take advantage of all the city has to offer. My top recommendation is to do something you love to fill your weekends. Don’t know what to do? Here are some suggestions:
If you love working out: Try a group workout class. Whether it is yoga, barre or spinning, you can make the day out of your workout class by finding a studio in a neighborhood you haven’t been to (Hollywood, Santa Monica, Brentwood, etc.) and spend the day exploring that part of town.
If you love food: You are in the right city. Every first Friday of the month, food trucks line the streets for Abbot Kinney’s “First Friday” event. Saturday, try a new brunch spot in Hollywood, or take a day trip to Malibu. Malibu Country Mart is not only home to some of my favorite restaurants, but also a great place to relax as the beach is right across the street. My Sunday recommendation is to go to Smorgasburg in Downtown. This option is not only close and convenient, but also a way to try dozens of food vendors in one place.
If you love adventures. There is no need to feel like you are stuck on campus over the weekend. An adventure can be as simple as a Metro or Uber ride away. Some of my favorite day trips include visiting museums (Getty Villa, LACMA, the Broad, etc.), walking around Olvera Street, exploring the Botanical Gardens in Pasadena, hiking Runyon Canyon and shopping on Melrose. 
Hang in there, your next vacation is only a weekend away.

It’s spring semester, which means that game days are no longer keeping USC students on campus on weekends. Many students decide to spend their weekends taking day trips; one of the most popular activities is hiking. There are countless hikes around Los Angeles that range from flat to extremely elevated and strenuous. People rave about hiking trails in Malibu, Pacific Palisades and even closer trails like Griffith Park and Runyon Canyon. Many students even take weekend-long trips to hike and camp at places like Joshua Tree and even Yosemite. Students with hiking on the agenda must remember to pack the right foods! There’s nothing worse than feeling lethargic and sluggish on a hike.

Nuts
Nuts are a perfect way to restore nutrients that are lost while hiking. Nuts are rich in heart-healthy fat and protein content, which will leave you feeling fuller for longer. Nuts also supply hikers with energy. Don’t forget to bring a bag full of nuts like almonds, cashews, peanuts and pistachios on your next outdoor adventure.

Granola
Granola is a perfect on-the-go snack for any hiker. Besides being delicious, granola provides people with a large variety of health benefits. It improves heart health, increases energy and can even lower blood pressure. Granola is perfect for a hike because it’s a very concentrated form of energy that will give an extra boost.

Dried Fruit
Dried apples, bananas, berries and dates are perfect fruits to take on a hiking trip. Hikers need to replace potassium and other nutrients lost from their activity, and dried fruit is the solution. Dried fruits are a delicious, easy snack to bring on your next trip.

Beef Jerky
If you need a light food that provides a great balance of fat, protein and carbohydrates, try beef jerky. Jerky is nonperishable, so it lasts for a while. It is also really easy to pack in your bag for a hike. It’s the perfect food for a longer outdoor hike.

Crackers
Crackers are a great source of carbohydrates and sodium, which are necessary for a long hike. The best part: Crackers are light, delicious and easy to just throw in your backpack.
