The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Sol Price’s Tomás Rivera Policy Institute and Sol Price’s Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise hosted the weekly Student Talk Back series. This week’s was focused on Los Angeles municipal politics in light of the upcoming Los Angeles mayoral race.
Loveridge, who entered politics in 1979 when he was elected to serve on Riverside’s city council, currently teaches in the political science department at UC Riverside. He spoke to students on the importance of city governance, particularly the significance cities had and the immediacy of policy changes at the local level.
“As mayor of a city, you see the consequences of everything you do,” Loveridge said. “You see the potholes that don’t get filled. You meet people who are directly affected by every action you take. That isn’t necessarily true for leaders in Washington and Sacramento.”
Much of the discussion was dedicated to Loveridge’s own experience running for public office and serving the mayor of Riverside from 1994 to 2012. He recalled approaching a political consultant soon after making the decision to run and being told to come back when he’d developed an agenda of what he wanted to accomplish.
“As mayor, you can advocate in ways that you can’t as a city council member,” Loveridge said. “I ran on the platform of safe streets, good jobs and great neighborhoods for the city. I distributed a pamphlet called ‘Renewing Riverside’, with my plan clearly mapped out so that people could hold me accountable.”
Riverside, which doubled in population from 150,000 to 300,000 during Loveridge’s 18 years as mayor, has been recognized on national and international levels for its development and programs. The wide-reaching recognition is fitting considering Loveridge’s past efforts to gain inspiration from other municipalities.
“I traveled to other cities and made it my goal to bring back three to five new ideas from every place I went,” Loveridge said.
Sustainability became of tremendous importance for Riverside as the city grew. Loveridge spearheaded issues of environmental protection, health, clean air and clean water.
“We regard ourselves as a green city,” Loveridge said. “I’m not sure that it’s a left or right cause. I think it’s about how people see their city and the aspirations they have for it. Sustainability can have tremendous consequences and opportunities for citizens.”
Loveridge made a point of defining local government as “friends-and-neighbors politics.” He stressed the importance of meeting directly with constituents.
“The next mayor of Los Angeles will have a huge responsibility. L.A. is one of the capitals of the world, and the person who leads it can have a tremendous impact not only on the city, but on all of Southern California,” Loveridge said.
Loveridge’s talk provided students with the type of practical background that frequently goes unmentioned in textbooks.
“Oftentimes in school you read a lot of academic, theoretical articles about running a city, but it’s really great when you see a mayor who can talk about the implementation process of real-life policies from the ground perspective,” said Yolanda De La Paz, a first-year graduate student in USC’s master of public policy program. “I think he really brought it home with the reminder that all politics is local and when you connect with people on that regional level, you can really make things happen.”
The mayoral primary election takes place March 5. The municipal election is on May 21.
Excellent article Austin, we’re hopeful that students enjoy the change to learn from experts in the field. The Bedrosian Center (http://bedrosian.usc.edu/), along with the Unruh Institue and the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute will be continuing this series for the rest of the semester. We’d love to hear feedback from students. Tell us what you liked and what you’d like to see in the future.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, Feb. 25, and Wednesday, Feb. 27. 
Crimes against a person
at 3:35 p.m. on Feb. 27, a student in Stardust Apartments reported receiving numerous harassing phone calls and text messages from an unidentified subject whom he believes to be another student.
Crimes against property
at 11:22 a.m. on Feb. 26, a student reported that his front windshield was smashed while his vehicle was parked at Parking Structure B.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 12:27 a.m. on Feb. 27, DPS officers responded to a report of two suspects prowling around residences near Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. They were detained and officers found one of the suspects possessed several syringes and the other was found in possession of two glass pipes, one of which contained residue of a controlled substance. The second suspect was also found in possession of prescription medication that did not belong to him. Both suspects were arrested.
at 4:44 p.m. on Feb. 26, DPS officers responded to a radiation alarm activation on the loading dock at the USC Keck Hospital. An environmental services staff member was on the dock when the officers arrived and she determined that a trash bag in the bin she was emptying had activated the alarm. The staff member then transported the bag to a containment room for proper disposal.
at 12:48 p.m. on Feb. 26, a non-USC male reported that his mentally disabled brother was missing after boarding a University tram near the Eileen and Kenneth T. Norris Dental Science Center. Transportation services personnel determined that the subject exited the tram at another stop and DPS officers found him inside a nearby restaurant. The subject was then reunited with his brother.
at 8:02 p.m. on Feb. 25, a student while riding his skateboard. injured his elbow when he collided with an unidentified bicyclist.
at 12:18 p.m. on Feb. 25, a staff member reported that he detected the odor of marijuana on the ninth floor of the Edward L. Doheny Jr. Memorial library. While conducting a search for the source, he discovered a plastic bag containing marijuana inside an unattended box. The owner of the box could not be located and the marijuana was subsequently booked at MDC by DPS officers.
Correction
“USC Libraries’ website to undergo extensive renovation by December” (Feb. 27) incorrectly implied that USC libraries did not have a mobile app. The university’s library system does have a mobile app and mobile interface system for searching resources.
The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Through iPodia, students from different cultures and time zones and can come together — in the classroom.
The iPodia classroom, a program through the Viterbi School of Engineering, connects USC students with those from China, Korea, Israel, Germany and other countries.

The work coincides with the university’s new partnership with the University of São Paulo in São Paulo, Brazil. A delegation of university deans and trustees led by President C. L. Max Nikias traveled to São Paulo earlier this week to open the university’s eighth international office.
Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and iPodia Director Stephen Lu conceived the program when he saw a need to revolutionize the classroom environment. Though, traditionally, students attend lectures and complete homework to understand concepts, in an iPodia classroom, students review the lectures for homework and come to class for interaction and discussion.
“Interaction gives you a good way to learn contextual understanding as well as mutual understanding,” Lu said. “If you have a chance to learn with different people from different countries, you learn in a different context.”
Through the Internet, students are able to learn in the same classroom with professors on the other side of the world. The university will host two online course sessions, with each session involving USC and two other universities.
Session A involves a partnership with Peking University in Beijing and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea. Session B will include students from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel and the RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.
Lu was inspired to create iPodia by his own time abroad, when he came to the United States as a student 35 years ago.
“I sat in the back. I didn’t speak in class or share my culture because I was so overwhelmed,” Lu said. “The iPodia experience, however, allows students to feel more comfortable sharing their opinions because they are in familiar surroundings.”
Lu said the structure of this learning should not be considered distance learning. Rather, he considers it a method of using technology to eliminate distance and differences between learners.
“You are able to achieve a classroom without borders,” Lu said. “It is the next wave of distance learning. This is a simple idea, but with a huge implication.”
Not only does iPodia use video conferencing in a new way, but it also reconsiders how material is taught. Lu refers to this method of teaching as “inverted learning.”
 
Kes Rittenberg, a freshman majoring in business administration who spent time with iPodia students in Korea, said he has already felt the impact of learning with international students.
“It was interesting to see how even though we all come from very different backgrounds, we still have some strong undeniable similarities,” Rittenberg said.
The course unfolds in three phases. Students watch the lectures from home discuss the lessons with the class online. Conferencing with international universities will start in phase two, beginning on March 16. The culmination of the semester will take place in Korea at a conference for all iPodia students.
Some students, including Stephen Collins, a senior majoring in electrical engineering, felt the time spent with the Korean students helped them orient themselves with the rest of the class.
“Whether I’m Skyping with a new classmate from Haifa, Israel, or trying to interpret a crazy emoji in our KakaoTalk chatroom from a classmate in Korea, I’m constantly surprised and excited by the interactions I’m able to have,” Collins said.
Lu proposes this as an alternative to global studies and the next step in the university’s globalization efforts.
“Instead of USC going to the world, iPodia brings the world to USC,” Lu said.

Recent Los Angeles reports of “flocking” crimes surrounding the university are being met with contradictory evidence from the Dept. of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department.
Gina Silva, a reporter with Fox 11 News in Los Angeles, repeatedly reported that teams of burglars known as “flocking crews” have been an increasing problem in the L.A. community.
The word “flocking” refers to group burglaries and is used loosely with other crimes in the reports. DPS Capt. David Carlisle said the department does not have a problem with increased burglaries.
“I’m familiar with what has been written in the past and our immediate relations personnel have dealt with this particular reporter, who has made these allegations that the gangs are targeting USC before,” Carlisle said. “USC Public Safety has no evidence of that and we have investigated with LAPD and they have nothing to substantiate the claims of the reporter.”
Silva said USC officials believe the incidents are crimes of opportunity as opposed to organized crime. When the story was first brought to the attention of DPS last year, the department checked with its counterparts in the LAPD to confirm that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that university students are specifically being targeted.
“The property thefts that we have observed are not consistent with flocking or any other type of organized criminal behavior,” the statement from DPS, released this month in response to the Fox 11 broadcast,  read. “These were largely crimes of opportunity committed by unaffiliated individuals. We made arrests in most of these cases and are confident that the suspects were operating independently.”
“Most of us in law enforcement had never even heard of [flocking] until this reporter brought it up,” Carlisle said.
Silva said the USC area dealt with more than 50 burglaries, assaults and robberies.
“Different gangs are running flocking crews in that area,” Silva said in her report, “because they know that students have expensive electronics.”
For example, burglaries have increased on Ellendale Place in recent years, according to DPS crime reports.  In 2012, 11 residential burglaries and two car burglaries were reported — an increase from six burglaries in 2011. So far in 2013, one burglary has occurred on Ellendale Place and no car burglaries were reported in 2012.
Some students, including Sohem Dhesi, a freshman majoring in architecture, maintain that they still feel safe on the University Park Campus, especially with the increased safety policies.
“Coming back from [off-campus] at 3 or 4 a.m. at night … before, I used to feel a bit concerned,” Dhesi said. “I felt that anyone could get in the gates, but it’s more difficult now so I feel better.”
Esolene He, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said that though she feels safe, she understands why the university may be an appealing target for burglars.
“It seems like a big concern, but it’s pretty safe,” He said. “However, it is a pretty wealthy school and we’re easy targets.”
Christian Vanderwall, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, attributed the crime to the surrounding area.
“It just happens to be that we’re the nearest location in a high concentration of criminals,” Vanderwall said.
Carlisle maintained that being aware and responsible, especially with personal  property, was of the utmost importance, especially on a college campus.
“There are thieves who come to USC to steal because the students have a lot of valuable electronics,” Carlisle said. “But, that’s true at every college campus.”
What the Flock is going here!
I got flocked twice last week.
I am not sure I feel comfortable knowing that Capt. David Carlisle feels most law enforcement personnel are not familiar with flocking. Makes me wonder how out of touch DPS might really be. 
I also wonder what would need to happen – or what he would need to see to constitute that organized, concerted burglary activities are happening. 
I assume criminals do not have formal meetings and processes like a Friar’s Club. All that is needed is to loosely get the word out that USC is a ripe haven for iPads, purses, wallets, laptops, etc and then let the criminal activities begin. Once again people – make no mistake – USC is in the ghettos. The school can try and make all the associations with DTLA but the truth of the matter is it is very much a South Central neighborhood. Let’s face it – schools like UCLA, does not need to man a yellow-jacketed “ambassador” on every street corner because Westwood is not in the ghettos. 
Too all you sanctimonious, politically correct people just itching to call me a racist – just remember – that is also why your Mommy and Daddy do not live in this neighborhood as well.

A new computer application designed by USC’s Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events Homeland Security Center will aid in increasing security and terrorism-prevention, the United States Coast Guard announced Wednesday.
The application was created for the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports.
The Port Resilience Operational and Tactical Enforcement to Combat Terrorism system, known as ARMOR-PROTECT, randomizes Coast Guard boat patrol schedules using algorithms, making patrol patterns unpredictable for enemies planning an attack. The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center contracted the project.
ARMOR-PROTECT, which was created by computer science professor Milind Tambe, was launched Feb. 1.
The Coast Guard is currently assessing the software at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, which have the eighth-highest container traffic in the world. There are plans to eventually implement the program at 361 ports nationwide.
In 2007, the ARMOR software was first used to randomize the scheduling of patrolling officers at police checkpoints on roads leading to the Los Angeles International Airport. Most recently, the program has been implemented on the Los Angeles rail system to prevent passengers from evading the fare.
The application received the Daniel H. Wagner Prize for Excellence in Operations Research Practice lfrom the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.

Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas spoke Wednesday night about the importance of broadening their definition of Americans to include immigrants and the need for immigration reform.
Dream on · Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas speaks to students Wednesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
 
The event, sponsored by USC Spectrum and Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board, had the support of Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Queer & Ally Student Assembly and the Speakers Committee.
Vargas, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his team’s coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings, is especially known for “coming out” as an undocumented immigrant in an article he wrote for the New York Times Magazine. Since then, he founded DefineAmerican, a campaign that discusses America’s immigration system.
“Immigration is more complicated than legal versus illegal,” Vargas said. “It’s not black and white. It’s living in limbo and living in a gray area, making difficult, sometimes impossible, choices.”
Vargas, who used the event to tell his story as an undocumented American and a gay man, encouraged students to speak out for reform in America because there is currently no line for immigrants to become legal citizens.
“Every 30 seconds, a Latino in America turns 18 years old and becomes an eligible voter — every 30 seconds. In 21st-century American politics, diversity is destiny,” Vargas said of the future of minorities and immigrants in America, which he compared to the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
Vargas said students can take a small step toward progressively is changing their terminology.
“To me, ‘illegal’ is such a slur,” Vargas said, “I already believed that, and then I went to the South, … where they have this crazy fear of something they can’t even tell you what it’s about.”
Director of USC Spectrum Dane Martens thought it was important to bring Vargas because of the relevance of immigration today.
“Immigration is something that’s on the top of everyone’s list nationally speaking and I think very much locally as well,” Martens said. “I think it’s going to speak to a lot of issues we’re trying to deal with in this country right now.”
Executive Director of Program Board Juan Espinoza agreed with Martens.
“It’s a pivotal time with immigration policy,” Espinoza said. “It’s something that Obama’s announced that he’s definitely put at the front of issues to deal with.”
 
Some students like Kevin Tsukii, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, found Vargas’ speech both educational and inspiring.
“I went in to it with this idea that, first, I didn’t know he was Filipino, I didn’t know he was gay, I didn’t know a lot of things about him,” Tsukii said. “I just knew that he came out as undocumented. I’m really glad I came and I’m really glad he’s here.”
Yvette Chua, a freshman majoring in international relations, praised Vargas for giving a voice to an underrepresented community.
“I thought it was really inspiring for an undocumented person to come out like that,” Chua said. “I think he’s just a public figure that the undocumented community needs because he gives the undocumented community a voice.”
 
According to the article, Mr. Vargas is an “undocumented” Filipino.
What that means is that he is residing in the U.S. in violation of US immigration laws, and that is why the correct team is “illegal alien.”
Illegal immigration has repercussions. For example, my wife and I are supporting the studies of a bright young scholar in the Philippines, who is also the president of her class. We invited her to come to LA for one month of her summer vacation.
But her application for a tourist visa was denied, for the following reason:
“There are so many Filipinos who in the past were give tourist visas but who then failed to honor their promise to return to the Philippines.
“In other words, their refusal to follow our immigration laws has taken away the opportunity for their law-biding countrymen to visit the US”
Great event.
Amy, I agree; USC Spectrum did a great job in bringing in this speaker. The conversation has been brought up.
That’s only the first step though. Considering the way USC defines what is important and what should be prioritized, this topic and conversation is a big step on our campus.
We should continue the conversation to get it in the minds of others who do not think the way that Jose A Vargas does. Not everyone is educated about the issue and after becoming so moved by this event, so inspired to do many things at once, I think we need to fan the flames that sparked in us during this event and encourage the conversation. Its preservation is necessary in order for farther actions, changes, and steps to improvement to happen.
It was truly amazing. He is a great speaker and storyteller.  I’m proud of USC for  allowing speakers like Jose Antonio Vargas to come talk to us about a rather controversial topic. As an undocumented student, his stories touched me personally and I felt like for once my voice was heard to the greater community of USC. USC boasts about their diversity efforts. But is it really? Accepting international students is only a small part of creating a diverse community. I believe it’s about creating a safe environment for anyone to question and discuss about differing ideas that are sometimes controversial. Let’s create a campus that  allows conversations between people of differing cultural background and ideas. There must be more dialogues that challenges our way of thinking and sometimes make us feel uncomfortable because it’s so different from our beliefs. Although this event highlighted on undocumented individuals, it’s beyond this single issue. It encompasses all the different issues  that many of our organizations are trying to advocate for. Great job USC Spectrum! Hope there is more to come!
It was truly inspirational. I’m proud to see that USC has taken steps to allow speakers like Jose Antonio Vargas to come and talk about a topic that is controversial. At USC, we talk about diversity. However in what context? Creating a diverse student body is more than accepting international students. Rather, I believe it’s creating a safe environment for anyone to talk about these differing and sometimes controversial topics that gets formed due to our diverse background. Immigration reform is one of many things. Let’s create a campus that engages in conversations that challenges us to see things in different ways and sometimes make us uncomfortable due to our differing opinions. I really hope to see more events like this. Great job USC Spectrum!
Democrats are blaming Republicans for the “Sequester” when it was President Obama signed it into law. Now he is using intimidation by alarming the American people, about the outcome of this law. All but in secrecy Homeland Security sent an interoffice memo to release up to 10,000 illegal aliens back on the streets. The 40 million Tea Party members are watching carefully the Liberal-Democrats and the Socialist Czars who craft most of the laws, designed to cripple the America we know. Democrats are issuing more freebies to the unknown numbers of majority groups, the poor and the freeloaders. Food stamps are more or less being passed out on a “Carte Blanche” basis and even free cell phones to anybody who applies. Some GOP Senators and Congressional leaders are running scared, because of the loss of the general election, when the truth is slowly emerging of giant irregularities of non-citizens voting. Now we have legislators as John McCain and others cringing to the demand that 20 to 30 million foreigners gain immediate legal status.
Next on the Democrats list is passing another illegal Alien amnesty that was poorly organized and full of fraudulent application and yet 6 million illegal migrants and immigrants were awarded a Path to Citizenship in 1986. What did it bring us, millions of more procuring citizenship welfare and an intensification to encourage even more foreigners skirting our borders, smuggled children and families? The country is in a dire emergency with a 17 trillion dollar debt, with Obama’s minions spending and spending and demanding more taxes to pay for another amnesty if it is enacted. The last Amnesty is still being paid for in illegal municipal ordinances as Sanctuary Cities, and federal pushes as the Dream Act, crucifying the taxpayer with Family Unification Chain Migration adding even more millions of people who will need Social Security and money to live on when retired?  Petition your Representative in Washington at NumbersUSA or make the effort to call them through the main government switchboard at 202) 224-3121. There are an estimated 23 million Americans either not working, but with pressing demand of big businesses their advocates that roam the halls of Congress still are gaining favors. The E-Verify provision of THE LEGAL WORKFORCE ACT must find passage in Congress, before any new immigration laws are given priority, also to include the 2006Secure Fence Act. Not one fence but at least two, stretching from Texas to California. In addition THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ACT to be voted on to stop the intentional smuggling of children into our nation from across the world, to gain immediate citizenship. These laws will draw to a close the hundreds of billions of dollars collected by people of foreign status.
To: David Francis
Non-citizens voting? The reality is my friend, that people now are not afraid to vote against big corporations who plan on maintaining the poor, poor and against those who plan on pushing America backwards not forward. I am PROUD that 71% Latinos and 70% of Asians voted for Obama. The minority of yesterday are no longer the minority but rather the majority believe it or not. This country is a multi-cultural, multi-lingual, and multi-racial. In fact, that is how it got started. So don’t go blaming or calling every brown, Asian, or middle eastern who Voted a non-citizen.
Second of all, you say that 20 to 30 million foreigners are gaining legal status? Since when? last time I heard that our immigration system was so broken people who applied for residency through LEGAL TERMS in year 1995 are still in line waiting. Plus we still have millions who are undocumented and they have not received that memo that it was so EASY, according to you to gain legal status. Wouldn’t that solve our problem right? You are wrong once again.
Third of all, Ronald Reagan a REPUBLICAN president  signed the law and it was a bi-partisan legislation by both REPUBLICANS and DEMOCRATS. The DREAM Act is not another form of amnesty, since it is a legislation intended to provide young children brought here illegally by their parents who are college students and who are the next generation of teachers, doctors, engineers, and lawyers. It does not provide a path to citizenship to all immigrants but specifically to students who will be and are the next contributors to our society. Then you say, they will end up relying on social security?Do you see doctors, teachers, engineers relying on that? Ask yourself that question. These students are ambitious, educated individuals in search of careers that will benefit the U.S economy and our nation. Maybe you should read more on what the DREAM Act truly is, and get better facts. You really believe that another fence is going to fix our broken immigration system? Really? Wow, its like having an infected wound and yet just putting a band aid on it. So no, a fence is not the answer and will not stop immigration. What needs to be done is fix our internal immigration issues since here in the united states we have millions of undocumented immigrants. Deportation is not the answer, especially since it affects taxpayers more than it does resolving a new Legislation for immigration reform. The DREAM Act is simply providing immigration relief to a fraction of that million. These undocumented students are hardworking individuals, TAXPAYERS,  and citizens of the U.S. How can you say that someone who was raised here all their life, sat next to you in class, grew up in your town, or graduated at your school does not belong here due to their birth certificate? How can you say this is not their home? In fact, who are you to say such claims? Immigration is an issue that need to be dealt with now, not tomorrow or next year. Reform Immigration now!
Truly inspirational speaker and amazing. I was inspired, motivated, encouraged, and amazed. Thank USC Spectrum and the other organizations for bringing such an amazing speaker. He really brought the issue of immigration to our USC campus. He inspired me in so many ways, especially since I am also an undocumented student at USC. He provided me a better perspective on what it means to be undocumented and to continue telling my story. Its not about “coming out, but letting people in.” Loved that. Thank you. 
Trojan/American/Citizen by heart and soul.
Truly inspirational and amazing speaker. He has really brought the topic of immigration to USC. I am really grateful that USC Spectrum and the other organizations gathered to bring such an important and inspirational speaker. I would like to see more speakers like Jose Antonio Vargas come to USC. I am an undocumented student myself and a student at USC. He has really broaden my perspective on what it means to be undocumented and how I can continue to tell my story. Thank you for bringing such a great speaker.

Still trying to regroup from surprising back-to-back losses, USC’s No. 2 men’s tennis team will take a trip to sunny San Diego today to face off against the No. 36 University of San Diego Toreros before competing in the Pacific Coast Doubles championship at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club this weekend.
Back to the basics · After two straight losses, senior Ray Sarmiento and the USC men’s tennis team will play relaxed tennis in its exhibition. — William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (12-2) are looking to get back to their winning ways in Thursday’s match against USD       (6-2) after dropping straight matches to No. 1 Virginia and No. 3 UCLA. The Toreros’ roster includes two ranked singles players: junior Clarke Spinosa at No. 82 and freshman Uros Petronijevic at  No. 112. The Trojans boast eight, the highest being junior Emilio Gomez, whose recent success has earned him the No. 4 ranking in the nation.
USC head coach Peter Smith is looking forward to facing USD head coach Brett Masi, who worked under Smith at USC from 2005-09. Masi was named ITA West Region assistant coach of the year in 2007 and 2008 and he helped coach the Trojans to the first of their four straight national championships in 2009. Given his accomplishments, the team plans to fight hard against USD, although the Trojans are 33-3 against the Toreros all-time.
“It’s going to be, of course, a tough match,” Gomez said. “We have to be ready to play.”
After the match at USD, the Trojans will get a break of sorts in a doubles tournament exhibition. The tournament, which spans from Feb. 28 until March 3, will feature doubles teams from Stanford, Cal, Pepperdine and UCLA but will not count toward the teams’ official win-loss record, so the Trojans are looking to have some fun and experiment with the doubles teams.
In the tournament, Smith will try out the tandem of freshman Max de Vroome and sophomore Eric Johnson. He also plans to pair up Gomez and his cousin, sophomore Roberto Quiroz. The cousins haven’t played doubles together this season but played together last year and also have previously partnered up to represent Ecuador in the Davis Cup.
“We’re going to live and die with Ecuador,” Smith said.
In addition, junior Ray Sarmiento will play with volunteer assistant coach Peter Lucassen in the doubles tournament because his usual partner, sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, is sitting out. Because it’s an open tournament, Sarmiento, who has yet to play in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships in his collegiate career, is permitted to play with whomever he chooses.
“I’ve always wanted to play in this tournament,” Sarmiento said. “So I’d rather play with Peter than not play at all.”
Although Sarmiento and Lucassen won’t be a permanent pair, Smith is happy to have the opportunity to try out the other new doubles teams. In their first nine matches, the Trojans opened up play by securing the doubles point. But the team conceded the doubles point in each of its last three matches — twice against UCLA and once against Virginia. In their first match against UCLA, the Trojans overcame their early deficit to secure the win. USC was not as fortunate in its next two matches, as the team’s singles play could not make up for its deficiency in doubles costing the Trojans their first two losses of the season.
“We need to do something different and we need to play with a lot more energy out there,” Smith said. “Hopefully this will be a good test.”
Though Smith sees the tournament as part of the team’s development, he also views the trip as a whole as an opportunity for the team to loosen up. Without the pressure of putting a win on the record, he and his players are looking forward to playing freely and to enjoying the warm weather and San Diego beaches.
“I think we’re going to be a little bit more relaxed,” Gomez said. “It’s kind of like our spring break.”

Stuck in the middle of a season-worst eight-game losing streak, the USC women’s basketball team is in dire need of a win as it heads to the desert to face the Arizona schools this weekend to wrap up Pac-12 regular season play.
They face Arizona on Friday, March 1, before taking on Arizona State on Sunday, March 3.
It has been a very tough stretch for the Women of Troy (8-19, 5-11 Pac-12), who have dropped 11 out of their last 12 games and are coming off   back-to-back defeats to rival UCLA. The Bruins bested USC first on Feb. 19 at the Galen Center, 68-54, and then on Feb. 24 at Pauley Pavilion, 63-58.
In their first meeting against UCLA, the Trojans shot only 28 percent, compared to the Bruins’ 43 percent, and trailed by as many as 27 points before cutting the deficit to 14, ultimately losing the game. Junior forward Cassie Harberts led the team in scoring with 17 points, while sophomore guard Kiki Aloufaituli had a career-high 11 points.
After suffering the lopsided defeat at home, USC head coach Michael Cooper made the necessary adjustments, as the Women of Troy were much more competitive in the second meeting. But the team was undone again by its own hand, plagued by 17 first-half turnovers and 22 total for the game. Harberts served up her 14th double-double of the season with a game-high 22 points and 11 rebounds, but the comeback once again fell short.
With the loss, the team ended up winless in the month of February. On the bright side, nearly every game was competitive, as five of their eight losses have come by single digits; four of those losses have come by five points or fewer. In Pac-12 play, USC is 3-4 in games that are decided by five or fewer points, a figure that suggests the team is not far off from turning a corner.
The grueling nature of the recent schedule has not helped USC in recent weeks. But coming off four games against top-20 ranked teams, the Women of Troy are now able to catch their breath as they take on two unranked teams in Arizona and Arizona State.
“Every game is going to be a close, tough game regardless of whether the team is ranked or unranked,” said senior forward Christina Marinacci, who has missed the majority of the regular season with a knee injury. “Regardless of who we are playing, these are going to be two huge games for us.”
The Arizona game comes at a good time for the Trojans, as Arizona was the last team they beat way back on Jan. 27 at the Galen Center by a score of 74-57. USC looks to complete their second straight season sweep against the Wildcats after defeating them    72-67 in Tucson and 78-62 at the Galen Center last year.
Arizona (12-15, 4-12) is coming off two tough losses to rival Arizona State last week, as they lost 81-77 in double overtime in their first meeting and 59-58 in their second game. The team is led by senior guard Davellyn White, who is averaging 16.8 points and 6.3 rebounds per game.
Looking ahead to Sunday’s regular- season finale, the Women of Troy will look to improve from the last time they played the Sun Devils.  In its first meeting of the year on Jan. 25, USC suffered a tough 60-53 loss to ASU after holding a 36-20 halftime lead.
“We will be lucky to get a lead on the road and we can’t afford to blow any big leads this time around,” Harberts said.
The Sun Devils’ (13-15, 5-11) top scorer is senior forward Janae Fulcher, who is averaging 11 points per game, while junior forward Joy Burke leads the team in rebounds, averaging 6.2  points per game.
Both of these games are important for the Women of Troy as they wrap up Pac-12 regular-season play and get ready for the Pac-12 conference tournament in Seattle, Wash., which will take place from March 7-10. USC currently sits at ninth place in the conference standings.
“These next two games are going to be huge for us,” Harberts said. “Hopefully we will get these next two wins and take that momentum into the Pac-12 tournament.”
Friday’s game at Arizona is scheduled to start at 7 p.m., while Sunday’s game against ASU is set to tip off at noon. Both games can be watched online, as they win be streamed live at Pac-12.com.

Before Saturday’s game against Arizona State, USC’s men’s basketball team will honor its five seniors before their final home game of their Trojan careers. Five names will be called, but the day will really belong to one player in particular.
Senior point guard Jio Fontan knows plenty about the highs and lows of Division I basketball. He’s seen it all in his five seasons of playing and, as he prepares for one last home game, he can’t help but take a brief look down memory lane.
“Probably beating UCLA my junior year,” Fontan said of his fondest Galen Center memory. “Beating UCLA at home, just having the crowd packed and getting that big win that led us to the tournament was awesome.”
The tournament that Fontan references, the NCAA tournament, is all but an afterthought as the 2013 season comes to a close. The “Second Chance Kids” never quite jelled this year, but the on-court results are leaps and bounds ahead of last year’s product.
It’s old news by now: the    2011-12 team, without its captain Fontan, sputtered through a mostly lifeless 6-26 season while its leader recovered from a torn ACL. That was the low point, and Fontan admitted that there were times when it seemed like he would never don a USC jersey again.
“[Leaving] was definitely a thought,” Fontan said. “But once I had the idea that [former head coach Kevin O’Neill] would come back, I definitely wanted to come back. Also, in talking with [former guard Maurice Jones], I wanted to come back and play with those two. Unfortunately, neither one is here now, but that was the plan.”
Jones left the program in September after being ruled academically ineligible, and O’Neill was fired on Jan. 14. Just like that, two of Fontan’s closest relationships were gone, but like he has before, the floor general pressed on and has the team near the top-half of the conference standings — a spot that was unfathomable only a year ago.
Given all he has withstood in the past, was there ever really any doubt?
Fontan started taking classes at USC in January 2010 after transferring from Fordham. Just one week prior to his arrival, USC announced self-imposed sanctions on its basketball program that barred it from postseason play for the 2010 season and limited scholarships. USC sputtered to the finish line that year, dropping its last six games, and had little to no momentum heading into the 2010-11 season.
But, Fontan provided just the spark that the team needed. After sitting out because of transfer rules while the team marched out to a mediocre 6-4 start, Fontan made his much-anticipated USC debut on Dec. 18, 2010, against then-No. 3 Kansas in Lawrence, Kan., where the Jayhawks had not lost in more than three years.
On this day, the Paterson, N.J., native did not disappoint, scoring 15 points in a tough     70-68 loss in which USC led with fewer than two minutes to play.
But the fire was lit, and the Trojans would finish the season 19-15, with upset wins over No. 18 Tennessee and No. 10 Arizona, en route to a berth in the NCAA tournament. Throughout the entire run, O’Neill continued to heap praise on his new star, labeling him the best guard in the country. When asked if he was affected by having such high expectations placed on him before he ever put on a jersey, Fontan merely scoffed.
“I felt the same way,” Fontan said of O’Neill’s praise. “I still feel the same way. I’ve had a lot of unfortunate situations, sure, but nonetheless, I’ve felt like every year I’ve played, including this year, I was the best point guard in the country.”
When all is said and done, Fontan’s name won’t be found at the top of any school or conference record books. By most measures, it would be hard to argue that he is indeed the best point guard in the country. His 12.1 career scoring average and 37.3 percent career shooting total would seem to mightily hurt his case.
To dismiss his statements outright is beyond the point. When Fontan says he is the best point guard in college basketball, you get the strong sense that he truly believes it. It is largely because of his high level of confidence that he has become the unquestionable face of the USC basketball program, despite his many bouts with adversity.
For the past few years, Trojan fans everywhere have celebrated their quarterback for leading the football program from the fallout of NCAA sanctions back to relevancy. In three years, Fontan has done that not once, but twice, first in 2011 in the wake of sanctions and then this year in the aftermath of the worst season in school history.
Yes, Matt Barkley has the numbers and star power that warrant such attention, but we praise him just as much for his leadership qualities and class. Fontan possesses these same attributes and, despite the many low points the team has had during his time in Los Angeles, the USC basketball program could not have asked for a better leader than the one it has had the past three years.
For his part, Fontan remains focused on the task at hand: earning just one more victory in front of his home fans. But, when asked what his USC legacy might be, he couldn’t hide his familiar grin.
“I just want the community as a whole to remember that I gave it all I had,” Fontan said. “I really felt the Trojan spirit and cared about the university. At the end of the day, I want them to remember that I gave it everything I had, night in and night out, and just tried to keep a smile on my face while doing it.”
For at least one USC fan, this will most certainly be the case.

Wednesday night produced an unfamiliar sight at the Galen Center: Students storming the court. And a well-deserved court storming at that.
Just three days after a 16-point home loss to UCLA, the Trojans set a season high by shooting a blistering 61.1 percent from the field, then made critical free throws down the stretch to hold on for an 89-78 upset over No. 11 Arizona (23-5, 11-5 Pac-12).
For a team that has had more ups and downs than a roller coaster, the stars all aligned for the Trojans on Wednesday.
Leading man · Senior point guard Jio Fontan was integral in USC’s upset victory over Arizona, scoring 12 points on five-for-11 shooting and dishing out nine assists. The win was USC’s first over a ranked team in over two years. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“Tonight was our night,” USC interim head coach Bob Cantu said. “A win like this just means everything. If we can beat Arizona, if we can beat UCLA on the road and Stanford on the road, that can mean everything.”
Against one of the top teams in the Pac-12, USC came to play from the start.
Mired in a monthlong slump, senior forward Eric Wise banked the ball off the glass while drawing the foul on the Trojans’ first possession, and the Trojans just took off from there. The two sides went back and forth over the first 10 minutes until USC went on a 7-0 spurt to take a 30-22 lead with 7:19 left in the first half. This lead stretched to 10 toward the end of the half, but Arizona went on a mini-run to make it 42-36 at the break.
Every time Arizona made some semblance of a run, though, the Trojans answered with an easy layup or open jumper produced through the best ball movement the team has shown all season.
“We continued to reverse the ball,” Cantu said. “We moved it, we drove it, we pushed it to the rim. Every time they were coming back on us, we were able to respond with a basket. It was a complete team effort.”
Wise led all scorers with a season-high 22 points, shooting nine-of-12 from the field and finding his way through the paint for an easy layup, possession after possession. Sophomore guard Byron Wesley had 18 points, including an eight-for-eight showing from the free-throw line, while junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell had 14 and senior point guard Jio Fontan and senior forward Aaron Fuller each had 12 for the Trojans.
Junior center Omar Oraby fouled out with 4:23 to go, but made a big impact off the bench with eight rebounds, five blocks and countless altered shots on defense in the post thanks to his seven-foot-two size. His play inside was a big reason USC outscored Arizona 42-32 in the paint.
Yet, for all the Trojans’ dominance from the floor, the Wildcats would not fade quietly into the night. After Fuller scored a layup to give USC a 60-50 lead with 13:25 left, Arizona answered with a pair of 3-pointers from Arizona guards Kevin Parrom and Jordin Mayes to cut the lead to four.
But, as soon as Arizona fans let their voices be heard, USC’s play quickly quieted them.
USC promptly went on a 7-0 run to push the lead back to 11. The Trojans made all 12 of their free throws in the final four minutes, and the Wildcats never cut the deficit below seven.
“We weathered the storm for the most part,” Fontan said. “It just comes down to execution.”
The win comes as a stark contrast from the last time the Trojans and Wildcats faced off, when USC was humbled, 74-50, in Tucson, Ariz. In that game, USC shot a season-worst 28.1 percent, in stark contrast to its hot shooting on Wednesday.
“It didn’t make any sense, but that’s what happens sometime,” Wise said about the difference between the two games. “I think we can compete with anybody if everybody comes ready to play.”
Cantu improves to 6-5 since taking over for former head coach Kevin O’Neill, and it seems as if his team could be turning a corner, this time for good.
“I knew we had talent,” Cantu said. “I knew we could beat people. We just want to play our best basketball when we get to Vegas.”
USC will take on Arizona State in the season’s final home game on Saturday at noon. The Pac-12 Conference tournament begins on March 13.

This week, Aimée Carter’s latest novel, The Goddess Inheritance, hit bookshelves, continuing the otherworldly literary trend in teen fiction.
Following in the footsteps of previous trends featuring vampires, werewolves and fairies, Greek gods and goddesses might be yet another installment in the teen fantasy literary canon, one that really picked up speed with the release of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight in 2005. Nowadays, when ambling down the aisles of Barnes & Noble, it’s hard to imagine a time when magic and the fantastical didn’t make up the bulk of young adult literature.
Carter’s The Goddess Inheritance marks the final segment of her five-book long The Goddess Test series, which follows 18-year-old Kate Winters as she struggles to handle the normal responsibilities of a teenager while fretting over her mother’s worsening illness. Her life changes, however, when she meets Henry, a Hades-esque figure who promises immortality and might just be able to save her mother — if she can pass seven tests and become his future bride and goddess of the underworld.
The Goddess Test stands alongside other works, such as Meg Cabot’s Abandon series, a modern retelling of the original Persephone and Hades myth. With adoring fan bases and largely indifferent reviews from major critics, the two series only add to a young reader’s startling obsession with antiheroic love interests.
Teen fantasy writers seem to hybridize villainy and romance in their male characters, though they sometimes tend to sacrifice some of their darker traits for sexier ones. Twilight had vampire Edward Cullen, with his bronze hair and “coal black” eyes. Similarly, Lauren Kate enticed lusty teens with the demonic Cam, a fallen angel who rivals the protagonist’s affection for the angel Daniel. For several readers, the more threatening the male love interest, the more enticing. And though, admittedly, other popular novels, such as Eragon, Inkheart and The Hunger Games, don’t quite follow this “attractive monster” formula, it’s hard to ignore the fact that teen fantasy has taken a shift toward darker romance.
This isn’t to rail against Twilight or to criticize the third-rate writing of several bestselling series. What is worth discussing, however, is that no matter the magical world, teen fantasy often glamorizes male love interests who seem dangerous or threatening — probably because the pattern has proven financially successful with Meyer’s Twilight series, which grossed $1.7 billion  on book sales alone according to Statistic Brain.
“It’s better if we’re not friends,” says Edward at the beginning of Twilight, in an attempt to dismantle Bella’s growing interest in him. “Trust me.”
Edward’s depiction in Twilight has earned Meyer criticism for glamorizing a romance that displays several characteristics of an abusive relationship. But, despite his warnings, Edward is hardly the monster he makes himself out to be.
Twilight readers quickly realize Edward is hardly threatening, despite his dialogue. Unlike his predecessors Dracula and the vampire Lestat, Edward doesn’t burn in the sunlight — he glitters. He doesn’t have sharp fangs, nor does he manage to adopt a grotesque appearance when he’s bloodthirsty. (Instead, his eyes turn black.) In short, as a monster figure, Edward has been completely emasculated.
“Bella, I couldn’t live with myself if I ever hurt you,” Edward says later in the novel. “You don’t know how it’s tortured me. The thought of you, still, white, cold … to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses … it would be unendurable.”
Yet again, readers are unsurprised when Edward reaches this epiphany. They’ve realized his harmlessness from the very beginning. And, perhaps as Meyer intended, he is much less a monster than a shell of a vampire who is dangerous more so as a man than as a folkloric creature.
Similarly, Jacob is also unthreatening — as a werewolf, that is. In one of the series’ “more dangerous” scenes, Bella gets angry at Jacob — he’s kissed her without her permission — and breaks her hand after punching him in the face. Though, in this sense, Jacob certainly causes physical harm to come to Bella, he is not threatening as a werewolf but as a man — one incapable of understanding the boundaries of sexual assault.
Admittedly, other teen fantasy novels tend raise the stakes a little more than Twilight does when it comes to potentially dangerous male love interests.
In the Wicked Lovely series, for example, Irial manages to seduce Leslie into a life-threatening stupor as he feeds on her negative emotions. Incapable of leaving his side, Leslie gives off behaviors largely reminiscent of a drug addict’s withdrawal symptoms. Here, author Melissa Marr definitely manages to convince her audience that Leslie could be heading for some serious trouble. As a result, readers understand why Leslie chooses to leave Irial by the end of Ink Exchange; he might be a partial lover but he is infinitely more villainous.
But Twilight’s not-so-monstrous monsters still bring to mind one question: Why are readers constantly seeking romance with characters who are pretending to be monsters? Characters such as Irial are dangerous and appropriately romantically unappealing. But without the pretense of scary fangs or genuinely terrifying werewolf behaviors, Edward and Jacob are free to be physically attractive yet still romantically problematic — and these are the characters that sell.
I’m not arguing for more abusive male characters here, but for a clearer recognition of what villainy actually looks like. In Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire series, for example, Lestat commits truly horrible actions such as abandoning his mother or freezing the child-woman, Claudia, in a permanent prepubescent state. In short, Lestat and similar characters’ good looks don’t make up for their horrendous actions. And though readers might enjoy reading about him, it’s clear that Rice doesn’t intend for her vampire to be a romantic interest to anyone outside of his demonic circle.
Yes, it’s true that villainy is ambiguous, and we might even be attracted to some of literature’s darker characters. But if authors want to increase the protagonist’s (and readers’) awareness of potential threats, something larger within the text should be at stake.
Maybe then, larger trends of abuse and danger might seem less romantically appealing.
 
Carrie Ruth Moore is a sophomore in majoring in English. Her column “Cover to Cover” runs Thursdays.
I enjoyed your take on villainy here & tweeted this to my fans :) 
FWIW, Irial is born out of the tradition of the Gothic villain and Byronic Hero, as (arguably) many of the love interests in recent YA paranormals are. Some are a softer blend with more of the Gothic Hero’s traits and only a few Gothic Villain traits, but in most cases, they boil down to some mix of the Hero & Villian & thereby fit into the pattern of the Byronic Hero (trying to be good but has a dark side/deep secret/danger to the love interest). 
Thx for the read.

“Everyone eats,” said Sue Tyson, an archivist at the special collections department of the USC Libraries, when asked why people should care about access to essential nutrition.

To hear Tyson tell it, food security should be at the forefront of the public consciousness. And to help promote the issue, Tyson, together with friend Chimene Tucker — a librarian at Doheny Memorial Library — have coordinated the upcoming Visions and Voices event “Just Food and Fair Food: A Multidisciplinary Exploration.”
The event, which takes place Friday, will hit at one of the core problems facing the world today: ensuring that everyone can eat healthily and affordably. Paula Daniels, senior advisor to the mayor of Los Angeles on sustainable food and water policy will moderate the conversation.
Following the panel, students can get free food and converse at a fair-food bazaar featuring cuisine from sustainable restaurants in Los Angeles such as Mama’s Hot Tamales, which is near MacArthur Park, and Homegirl Café in Chinatown.
As Tucker noted, healthy and fresh food is a big challenge in urban environments, particularly those that are economically depressed.
“[If] the only place you can get produce is at a corner bodega or a 99 cent only store … where is that produce coming from, how long has it been there?” Tucker asked.
The food you might find there is often low-quality at best. Chips and sodas are much easier to stock than fresh fruits and veggies at a corner mart, so finding good food can be a challenge in the inner city.
More importantly, the lack of healthy, affordable food creates numerous problems.
“What about obesity? What about health care costs? What about those other costs for cheap food?” Tyson said.
But the problems are not just contained to inner-city markets. Too often, food sold to American consumers is not locally produced to save on costs. That can create environmental harms and reduce the quality of the produce.
Tucker noticed the problem when she went to pick up produce at a local grocer and wondered about some of the items in her basket.
“Why am I getting cucumbers from Jamaica? I thought, ‘Really, from Jamaica?’” Tucker said.
Jamaican cucumbers might be cheaper than California-grown ones, but shipping produce across borders reduces the quality of the food and has a greater environmental impact. Thus, consumers who want to eat well and inexpensively are caught between expensive local produce and poor quality food.
Addressing these problems will require multiple approaches — food security is a multidisciplinary issue. For this reason, Tucker and Tyson have teamed up to bring a panel of food experts, policy makers, local activists and experienced chefs together to discuss the matter.
Following the panel discussion, the panelists and the audience will eat a catered lunch together, giving students and experts more time to interact and discuss the issues. The lunch promises to be a great opportunity to see firsthand how talented local chefs turn ordinary ingredients into wonderful meals.
Unfortunately, for many in Los Angeles, the kind of cooking that USC students can experience at the panel is a rarity. Tucker said that she thinks students should care more about the food they are consuming.
“Students at USC, now that they are at USC, have to think about food in a completely different way,” Tucker said. “Food is a completely different thought.”
USC students become interested in changing the system, there is much that can be done with existing resources on campus. Both Tucker and Tyson are full of ideas about creating rooftop gardens, hosting cooking classes, exploring the economic disparities that lead to food deserts, engineering new methods of transportation to move fresh food around the world, experimenting with soil composition to grow better food more efficiently and influencing policy makers to change the system.
Overwhelming evidence suggests the food system in this country and in the world today is broken. The conversation on Friday will look at solving some of those problems and, according to Tucker, “may gear toward completely changing the system.”
There is much for activists to do, and Tucker is optimistic:
“The sky is the limit.”

The Transportation Security Agency must reform its security policy in order to improve the experience.
Alexa Youssefian | Daily Trojan
Foremost, TSA screening procedures do not work. The new full-body scanners going into effect in every airport have repeatedly been found to fail to catch trained testers smuggling in explosives designed to bring down airplanes, according to CNN. The mechanical parts necessary to build bombs have repeatedly gone through X-ray machines undetected. Three fluid ounces of liquids have proven to be enough to build a bomb.
Nevertheless, the TSA is firm in adhering to policies that might not be optimal.
By comparison, the security personnel in the European Union do a much gentler job of checking travelers for bombs and weapons. Families with small children are not put through humiliating security procedures designed to ruin their trips to Disneyland. EU security personnel realize the threat that terrorists might pose, but they also realize that effective screening procedures need not be intrusive and harsh. EU security personnel also have the benefit of being moderately well-liked, or at least not actively hated. In turn, this makes European travelers far more likely to work with European security personnel to adhere to security policies and police other travelers to prevent terrorist attacks, according to Your Europe.
In fact, the TSA should note that there have been no incidents of terrorist hijackings of airplanes since 9/11, including in Europe, where standards are much lower, and in many parts of Africa and Asia, where the standards are lower still. The TSA is convinced that spending lots of money and compromising the dignity of individual travelers is the only way to stop terrorists, when the reality is just the opposite.
John Mueller, a professor of political science at Ohio State, found that the costs of maintaining the full-body scanners and other security measures at airports costing more than $1.2 billion per year is only justified on a cost-analysis basis if there is guaranteed to be a terrorist attack every two years and the TSA is able to stop that threat. Because TSA has repeatedly been unable to stop a trainer from bringing bombs through airport security, and the costs are astronomical, the TSA needs to take a look at seriously reforming policies. There are low-cost and less invasive alternatives to stopping terrorist threats that have proven to be just as effective as the measures currently in place in U.S. airports.
The goal of the TSA is to stop a terrorist attack. The difference between a terrorist attack and a  run-of-the-mill murder is that a terrorist attack is specifically designed to instill terror in the minds of the victims and the countrymen of the victims. Thus, the attacks on 9/11 were more than just 3,000 dead Americans; it was a nationally significant event that has shaped American policy for years, causing leaders to take us into two unjust wars and a nebulous mission to stop terrorism worldwide. By comparison, cancer kills 3,000 Americans every two days but curing cancer is much less of a national priority than stopping terrorism. When it comes to instilling fear in the minds of Americans, however, terrorist groups like al-Qaida have been unable to perpetrate a major attack against the U.S. since 9/11. Yet, every year, the TSA intimidates millions of American travelers.
The people most likely to be harmed and stopped because of the policies of the TSA are not terrorists. Average American travelers, who are more concerned with having enough leg room on the plane than with murdering innocents, are the most likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected by the current TSA practices.

Children should not be given special treatment when it comes to the safety and welfare of all passengers.
“They said they needed to pat her down,” Nathan Forck told the New York Daily News. “They wouldn’t give her Lambie.”
Making a little girl in a wheelchair cry on her way to Disney World is not okay. But, it would also be unfair to blame the TSA for the incident, as the agents at Lambert-St. Louis International were simply trying to follow protocol in an admittedly sensitive situation. Instead, Lucy’s parents should have done a better job in cooperating and explaining the situation to their child. Doing so could have avoided the stress for Lucy altogether.
Going through airport security can be a pain, but following 9/11, the U.S. government has supported TSA’s security protocols as crucial to America’s safety. To be fair, there hasn’t been a terrorist attack carried out on U.S. soil since. It’s impossible to tell whether that’s because of  extra safety precautions or military action against terrorist groups, but the current system is effective without infringing on citizen’s rights.
With the expansion of these security protocols over the past decade, everyone who travels even semi-frequently should be aware of how the TSA checkpoints work. Lucy’s parents, traveling with a child with physical limitations, could have explained to the child the procedure she needed to go through, helping to mitigate the child’s stress. According to the TSA’s policies, Lucy’s parents could have spared Lucy a pat-down by carrying her through and putting the wheelchair through the scanner (Lucy was eventually allowed past without a pat-down, but agents tried to perform the procedure).
TSA even welcomes suggestions on how to best screen children with disabilities. Lucy’s parents could have formed a plan, explained it to Lucy and asked that TSA agents try their best to follow an alternate plan. Without direction, though, TSA agents are forced to follow protocol. Because Lucy’s parents didn’t carry her through and she remained in the wheelchair, there was no other way to search her than a pat-down.
The fact of the matter is that the TSA needs to follow its protocols with consistency. It’s tragic, but terrorists do use children: Joseph Kony turned the Uganda into a training camp for his child soldiers. Al Qaida has 5-year olds with firearms taught to be martyrs for the organization. If young children in the world are suicide bombers, then children in the U.S. cannot be exempt from airport security searches. If terrorism is going to be attempted on U.S. soil, it has to be assumed it will take similar forms to terrorism in the Middle East. And that includes children.
It might seem silly that a white toddler in a wheelchair was thoroughly searched by the TSA. Couldn’t the examiners just let Lucy through when they saw how distraught she was? After all, toddlers rarely have access to bombs. However, I’m proud to say our airport security doesn’t racially profile and assume people of Middle Eastern descent are the only ones capable of using children for suicide bombing. Alternatively, Lucy, adorable and handicapped, would be the perfect target for someone to plant a bomb, perhaps even without her or her parents’ knowledge. Searching Lucy doesn’t need to imply that she’s a terrorist. However, if everyone isn’t thoroughly searched before entering a plane, everyone’s lives are in danger.
Leona Fallas is a freshman majoring in sociology.
No searches should take place of anyone without “probable cause”
Ms. Fallas: The TSA admitted the agent was NOT following protocol, either in her threat of the pat-down or in the agent’s representation that it was illegal to videotape the incident.
As to your larger point about the need for hyper-vigilance at airport checkpoints, perhaps we should expand the search authority of the federal government and the TSA to match what madmen in other countries have done with children.  Why restrict searches to airports?  Perhaps children walking down a street should be pulled aside for random pat downs because they might be human bombs because, you know, Kony… The terrorists have certainly succeeded in terrifying you if you think it is perfectly reasonable to pat down three year olds in wheelchairs.
Leona, your article reminds me of the justifications I’ve read from defenders of the Nazis’ barbarities.
Tormenting a child in a wheelchair — tormenting ANY child, for the matter, or any human being — is the mark of savages. You should be ashamed of yourself, applauding such cruelty and, worse, blaming the victims, Mr. and Mrs. Forck.
Dan is absolutely correct: the TSA’s ludicous nonsense has proved entirely ineffective over and over again, in numerous tests. Even the agency’ premise — that terrorists lurk on every concourse, waiting to blow us sky-high — is doubtful. The State Dept. issues a “Country by Country” census on terrorism every year: you might want to read and analyze it before you swallow the TSA’s propaganda and spew it back at us again.
The Constitution’ Fourth Amendment specifically prohibits exactly what the TSA does. So does basic decency.
ABOLISH THE TSA.
Was the mischievous hijacker in the cartoon next to the Point article portrayed as a fair-haired Caucasian male so as not to offend anyone’s ethno-political sensitivities? 
Well-written articles; I do not agree expressly with either.
The reason TSA procedures appear so ridiculous is because we are implementing Marquess of Queensberry Rules to counter a cowardly group of dangerous terrorists that do not adhere to any rules. it is as if our military needed to beat drums and wear bright red lobster-back redcoats when fighting in the battle. Going through TSA reminds me of a Three Stooges but where Moe would punch Curly in the stomach – so Curly places his hands in front of his stomach – then Moe punches him in the nose – so Curly puts his hands in front of his face – then Moe steps on his foot – so Curly picks up his foot – then finally Moe clubs him over the head knocking the dawdling Curly down and out.
Taking off shoes, putting our liquids into plastic bags – these are all the one-step-behind defenses we implement AFTER the threat of these issues occurred.
The author of this article is just happy and “proud” that the bothered toddler was white. Really? Are we so poisoned with political correctness that we see these events as a self-congratulatory incident? Seems to me the terrorists are laughing at us at our clumsy efforts to protect our own innocent citizens. Rather then re-actively implement procedures after the threat presented itself (like the Three Stooges method of defense where you block high and low only after you got smacked in the face and then gut) we should show the world the US will make available ALL tools at our disposal. To ignore the basic fundamental Spidey sense we are born with because we are so scared sh+tless that someone might suggest it is racist is hypocritical at best. 
I do not feel more secure knowing out security resources and mental energies are being burned giving a handicapped toddler the 3rd degree.
