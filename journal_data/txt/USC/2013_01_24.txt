The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, Jan. 21 and Wednesday, Jan. 23.
crime against a person
at 9:13 a.m. on Jan. 23, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect driving near 36th Plaza and Vermont Avenue that was identified using license plate recognition software. LAPD officers were requested for assistance and detained the suspect during a traffic stop. The officers confirmed that the vehicle had been reported stolen then the suspect was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
crime against property
at 8:17 a.m. on Jan. 23, a non-USC male reported that the front bumper of his car was damaged while his vehicle was parked next to the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 7:35 a.m. on Jan. 23, two suspects in a vehicle pulled up and stopped next to a non-USC male who was walking near 35th and Hope streets. Both suspects got out brandishing handguns and demanded the males property. The victim complied, handing over his cellular phone and money. Then, both suspects returned to the vehicle and drove away.
at 5:32 p.m. on Jan. 21, DPS officers responded to a non-USC male complaining of chest pains and difficulty breathing at the Keck Hospital of USC. A Rapid Response team was at the scene examining the male when the officers arrived. He was subsequently transported within the facility for medical treatment.
at 5:09 p.m. on Jan. 21, DPS officers responded to a student who was struck by a vehicle while riding his bicycle on 30th and Hoover streets. The student sustained abrasions to his hand and knees, so an LAFD RA unit was requested.  RA Unit #15 responded and treated the student, then he was released at the scene. LAPD officers were also requested and responded to conduct a traffic investigation.

When economics associate professor Mark Moore introduces himself as both an economist and an actor, he often raises eyebrows.
“Some people are surprised that an economist is involved with theater,” Moore said. “I’m sure some think it’s odd but, by and large, people are used to the idea that people have many hats.”
Though Moore now successfully balances his two careers and has a one-man play running in the Village Gate theatre next week, his journey to the stage was at times an upward battle.
Individuals, such as his father and his economics mentor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, held expectations for Moore’s life that conflicted with his own.
“At the time, I thought, ‘Do I betray my father, my mentor or myself?’” Moore said.
After teaching at USC for three years, he took a year off in 2006 to earn a master’s in fine arts at the Shakespeare Theatre Company Academy for Classical Acting at George Washington University.
Moore returned to teach at USC in 2007 but still embraces his “unlikely creative obsession” by performing and writing on the side.
“Balancing it all is a fun challenge and a work in progress,” Moore said. “It’s a struggle, but it’s not a bad struggle. It’s an interesting one.”
Moore believes the two professions complement each other better than most might think. He attributes his experience and professional education in acting to the teaching styles he has developed as a USC professor.
“Giving an economics lecture that doesn’t have raw emotional power can be a bit difficult,” Moore said. “But through my acting background, I’ve learned to keep the classroom alive in a way that the stage to me is alive.”
Moore’s upcoming show, Crooked Roads, explores his struggle to make the most challenging decisions of his life: balancing his interest in economics and his passion for acting. Though he graduated from MIT to pursue a career in the classroom, he still itched to be on stage.
“Acting demands a full commitment of yourself both physically and emotionally,” Moore said. “The ability to share that live on stage is amazing to me.”
In addition to playing each character himself, Moore wrote and produced the show. He said he looks forward to expressing himself to a USC audience.
“It’s a great experience to write your own words and to get a chance to perform them,” Moore said. “And it’s tremendously rewarding to just say something that’s in you to say.”
Jessica Stauffer, a junior majoring in economics, personally relates to the play’s premise. After taking two courses with Moore, Stauffer met with him to help her choose her major and discuss which career path best suited her interests.
“It’s ironic that the play is about Professor Moore figuring out what to do with this life, because those are the very conversations I have had with him,” Stauffer said. “He really helped me figure out a plan for my future, so I am excited to support him since he first supported me.”
Moore said the show will resonate with USC students, especially since choosing a career path lies just around the corner for them.
“Students are about to face important life decisions with competing expectations,” Moore said. “I think the show really strikes a chord with this audience, which is really what I’m in it for in the end.”
 
Crooked Roads plays at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29 and Thursday, Jan. 31 at the Village Gate Theater. Admission is $10 for students, faculty, staff and alumni.

USC Civic Engagement announced the dates for this year’s upcoming Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, to be held April 20-21.
Ready to read · The annual festival hosts more than 150,000 people each year. This is the third year the event will be held on the USC campus. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
Having attracted more than 150,000 people each year, the Festival of Books is an annual, free, public celebration of the written word, hosted by USC. This is the third year the book fair will be held at USC. Until 2010, it had been hosted in Westwood, at the UCLA campus. Readings, features and seminars will include hundreds of authors and exhibitors.
In the spirit of the love of books, the university’s third annual online book drive was launched Wednesday, coinciding with National Literacy Day. The drive’s headquarters is located at 32nd Street/USC MaST High School, a member of the USC Family of Schools. The drive got off to an auspicious start, receiving a single donation of 25,000 books from Piccolo Books.
Last year, 8,000 books were donated to shelve classroom libraries within the USC Family of Schools. Civic Engagement and USC Bookstores will be setting up a user-friendly online donation system and bookdrop stations, located at University Park Campus, Health Sciences Campus and the Los Angeles Times building.

USC Hospitality unveiled a new website this week for its express catering service, which will replace the USC room service website and include a larger menu.
Erika Chesley, the USC Hospitality associate director for special events, sales and marketing, said the new express catering service will focus on delivering prepared food and drinks anywhere on the University Park or Health Sciences campuses.
“During this summer and up to this point, we worked on creating a brand-new menu for the new concept,” Chesley said. “We deliver freshly prepared meals that are for groups anywhere from 10 to 500 guests, and pretty much everything is either cold or room temperature service, with exception to the coffee.”
Chesley said one of the main changes will be the new website, which she said is an improvement upon the old USC room service site.
“The new website is phenomenal,” Chesley said. “The website we had for room service was very outdated … this new site is very easy to use and it only takes a couple clicks to get your order.”
Chesley also said the express catering service’s menu will be different from the original room service menu since USC Hospitality plans to offer more selections in the new menu, as well as upgraded versions of old menu items.
“We’ve expanded the menu and there are more breakfast selections that are available now,” Chesley said. “When it comes to the lunches, we’ve really upgraded the sandwiches, so there’s a wider variety of sandwich options now than there were before.”
Some faculty members, such as Associate Director of the Marshall Undergraduate Advising Office Aba Cassell, have praised the service for being a convenient meal option.
“I use the express catering because it’s convenient, and because in terms of service, I believe they do a good job,” Cassell said.
Cassell did, however, voice concern over the quality of the service.
“In terms of placing the order and paying, it can be a bit difficult, though, because it seems they are short-staffed,” Cassell said.
Some students said they would not use the service because of its price.
“I saw the [updated] USC express catering website from an email from USC Hospitality, and it seemed to be easy to use and well put together,” said Nicole Matthews, a sophomore majoring in political science. “The only issue that I have with the whole service is that it’s pricey for a college student on a budget and frankly, it’s unreasonable unless you work for a department at USC and need something convenient.”

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory came together Thursday to host ClimatePalooza 2013, an event raising awareness for global climate change.
Panels took place throughout Annenberg simultaneously, allowing guests the opportunity to hear expert opinions from some of NASA’s finest scientists and the university’s climate change scholars. The panels stressed collaboration among scientists.
“We’re hoping that there will be some way to bring together all the different parts of USC that are concerned with climate change and get us together to work together to do multidisciplinary research,” said Larry Pyror, an associate professor of environmental journalism in Annenberg. “And at least be aware of what all the departments are doing so that we don’t act in isolation.”
The booths were located in the Annenberg library and had representatives from organizations that pertained to the environment — Aquarium of the Pacific, for instance, ran booths that showed how global climate change affects the ocean. The table representing the Aquarium of the Pacific held a demonstration that visualized the amount of time it takes for different items to disintegrate.
One panel at the event highlighted the science behind global climate change and featured scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Panelists Christopher Borstad Ph.D, Josh Fisher Ph.D., Chip Miller Ph.D. and Jorge Vazquez Ph.D. discussed the environment based on their scientific background and ongoing studies. They emphasized the importance of working with the rest of the world in an effort to mitigate global climate change.
“A lot of the issues we’re all talking about here today to understand the science behind climate change is going to involve international collaboration,” said Vazquez, who primarily studies the oceans and ice in both North and South America.
Vazquez has collaborated with other scientists throughout the world to create a global map of the temperature of the ocean, demonstrating how hurricanes cool the water off as they move. In speaking about collaboration, Vazquez noted that the best possible solution emerged from the shared information among satellites.
Other speakers spoke about their experiences in the field. Borstad, who studies the mechanics of glaciers and how they crack, told the audience that he uses his senses to notice the changing world around him, not just his scientific observations.
“I soon learned after about the first day [of staring at the glacier] that it’s better to use your ears than your eyes because ice makes a lot of noise when it fractures,” Borstad said.
Global climate change — as seen in the work of the panelists and environmental scientists around the world — is a hot-button topic for some. But beyond examining the political pitfalls of environmental discourse, panelists pointed out that it’s a matter of personal ethics.
“It does start with yourself — with how you conduct your life and how aware you become of how the climate and the environment work,” Pryor said.
Pryor added that it is vital that people comprehend how ecological systems work in order to make a change. Without an understanding of the current state of global climate change and how research is conducted, it’s impossible for the community to come together and make amends, Pryor said.
“How can we make intelligent estimates if we don’t know how numbers are generated?” Pryor said.
The panelists at ClimatePalooza also encouraged students to start conversations on the Internet. During the discussion, the audience was even urged to ask the panelists questions via Twitter.
“Media will provide us a way to have worldwide conversations,” Pryor said.
Global climate change entails an array of things, an array of countries and an array of people, all of which ClimatePalooza covered during its event at Annenberg.
“It’s clear that we’ve entered into what many people call the geological era where humans dominate,” said Miller, who studies the carbon in the atmosphere.
Pryor said people should be responsible for educating themselves about the rise in global warming.
“We all have to try to understand the mechanisms that are leading to these changes,” Pryor said. “We all have a responsibility to educate ourselves and to listen to the scientists.”

The USC women’s basketball team hopes to bounce back from a pair of tough losses against top-10 conference opponents as it takes on the Arizona State Sun Devils on Friday at 7 p.m. and the University of Arizona Wildcats on Sunday at 2 p.m.
High hopes · Sophomore guard Ariya Crook and the Women of Troy are looking to snap a two-game losing streak as the team returns home. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (7-10, 4-2 in the Pac-12) competed until the end against both No. 7 Cal and No. 6 Stanford, losing 71-63 to the Golden Bears in overtime and 75-66 to the Cardinal. The Golden Bears came back from a six-point deficit to force the game into overtime, then held USC without a field goal in the extra period. Junior forward Cassie Harberts scored 15 points for USC, while junior forward Kate Oliver added 10 points and 10 rebounds. Cal’s forward Gennifer Brandon finished with 23 points (15 in the second half) and 26 rebounds, while guard Layshia Clarendon added 27 points (six in overtime).
USC overcame a 33-20 deficit at halftime to cut Stanford’s advantage to as low as six points, but was unable to take the lead, despite scoring 46 points in the second half. Harberts finished with 21 points, her 18th straight game with double-digit scoring this season, while sophomore guard Ariya Crook added 18 and sophomore forward Alexyz Vaioletama scored 10 points. Stanford’s Chiney Ogwumike finished with 29 points and 16 rebounds, while Joslyn Tinkle scored 15 points.
“I think we’re at a really good place and time right now during conference,” Harberts said. “We went up there 4-0, so I thought that was a really good start. We had a chance to take two of the top-10 teams down, and I think even though we came up short in both games, it showed true character in who we are right now. We don’t give up.”
Arizona State (10-8, 2-4 Pac-12) and Arizona (11-6, 3-3 Pac-12) are both coming off a pair of games against No. 20 Colorado (15-2, 4-2 Pac-12) and Utah (10-7, 1-5 Pac-12).
Colorado beat both Arizona State and Arizona, winning 57-43 and 79-36, respectively. The Utes, meanwhile, defeated the Sun Devils 66-46 (their first Pac-12 win of the season) and lost to Arizona, 62-58.
The Sun Devils are led by forwards Janae Fulcher and Joy Burke. Fulcher leads the team in scoring with 11.5 points per game to go along with 5.1 rebounds. Burke is averaging 7.6 points and 5.9 rebounds per game.
Senior guard Davellyn White leads the Wildcats with 16.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, while junior guard Kama Griffitts is averaging 11.5 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.
“I think we’re more focused right now on the short-term goals,” associate head coach Daron Park said. “We’ve taken the mentality right now that the next game on our schedule is the most important game of the season. That’s the way we’re preparing. That’s what our approach is for, so right now, Arizona State on Friday night is the most important game of the season.”
USC swept both Arizona and Arizona State last season, winning 60-48 and 59-53 in two matchups against the Sun Devils, while defeating the Wildcats by scores of  72-67 and 78-62.

USC defensive backs coach Marvin Sanders has been fired after one season with the team, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced on Thursday.
Saying goodbye · USC will have a new-look secondary next season without junior cornerback Nickell Robey and two other starters. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“We wish Marvin Sanders and his family the best of luck,” Kiffin said in a statement. “Marvin did a great job for us coaching our secondary and in recruiting. But with the hiring of Clancy Pendergast as our defensive coordinator, we decided to go in a different direction based on Clancy’s desire to oversee the defensive backs unit.”
The 45-year-old Sanders led a defensive unit that finished the season ranked 41st in pass efficiency and ninth nationally in interceptions, with 19.
Kiffin didn’t have to go far to find a replacement, as the secondary will be overseen by Pendergast, who also looked over that unit for the Dallas Cowboys from 2000-02.
USC’s defensive staff has been in flux following the departure of former defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, who is now serving  in the same position for the Dallas Cowboys. Last season, his defense allowed 24.3 points a game, which was good enough for 40th in the country. Linebackers coach Scottie Hazelton is set to become the new defensive coordinator at the University of Nevada, CBS Sports reports.
The loss of Sanders raises questions about the destination of some of USC’s 2013 recruits, including five-star cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Ramsey is currently committed to the Trojans but is still being courted by the University of Florida and Florida State University. National signing day for high school players is Feb. 6.
The Trojans’ secondary will have a much younger look to it next year, as it loses seniors T.J. McDonald and Jawanza Starling to graduation. Junior cornerback Nickell Robey also declared for the NFL draft. Remaining at the cornerback position are sophomore Josh Shaw, junior Torin Harris and freshman Kevon Seymour. Junior safety Demetrius Wright will also return.

It’s been quite the whirlwind in the world of social media this past week, especially in the collegiate ranks. Last Wednesday, Deadspin reported that Notre Dame’s star linebacker Manti Te’o had been involved in a massive hoax that took place over the phone and in the Twittersphere.
Te’o became the face of college football in 2012 when his girlfriend of nearly three years, Lennay Kekua, died of leukemia the same day that his grandmother passed away. It then came out that Kekua never existed and the relationship with Te’o was exclusively over the Internet — and that “her” Twitter account was being run by Ronaiah Tuiasasopo, an alleged friend of Te’o’s.
Now, the details are still a little hazy. Some believe that the linebacker was in on the scheme the whole time and was using the death of Kekua as a way to vault his Heisman Trophy status  with a sob story. Te’o said he was duped, though he acknowledged that the girl was indeed fake. The whole situation is a little crazy, to say the least. But if anything, this fiasco says more about the state of social media in collegiate athletics than it does about Te’o as a person. And this wasn’t the first instance that social media caused a major controversy in the 2012 season.
At the beginning of the college football season, ESPN reported that Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones tweeted, “Why should we have to go to class if we came here to play FOOTBALL, we ain’t come to play SCHOOL classes are POINTLESS.” He faced a large backlash for making the statement. It’s clear that social media has taken control of college athletes and young adults as a whole; there really isn’t a way to stop it, either. No campus is safe from the potential destruction Twitter and Facebook hold within them. Athletes use it as a forum to express themselves, which is perfectly fine. Some use it to put themselves on a pedestal which, while conceited, isn’t really wrong. Many also use it as a platform to say damning things. Or, in certain circumstances, athletes use it for their social lives, whether it be promoting a party or professing love.
Not even USC is safe from the Twitter bug.
The Trojans made big news in December when senior linebacker Tony Burnett tweeted about how boring El Paso, Texas (the site of the Sun Bowl) is. According to The El Paso Times, Burnett tweeted, “Georgia Tech!? El Paso, Texas!? New Year’s Eve!? FML,” as well as the warning that, “If you never seen a giant real life tumbleweed get ready.” This led to a fair amount of drama, mainly about how spoiled the Trojans are, and added more fuel to the fire as to why many college football fans dislike USC. Fair enough.
On the whole, however, USC’s sports information department has been on top of its athletes’ social media accounts. Generally speaking, they’ve done a fantastic job of not putting players in a position to look like fools.
Take senior quarterback Matt Barkley, for instance. As one of the stars of college football, Barkley had the chance to take advantage of his fame via Twitter, whether it be through promoting himself or just advancing his social life. But, evidently, Barkley was instructed to be better than that. Taking a glance at his account, one sees tweets that read, “Happy Birthday to USC’s AD @ADHadenUSC! You are the best representation of what it means to be a Trojan!” or “You can’t practice ordinary habits and expect extraordinary results.. Challenge yourself!” Nothing flashy. Nothing incriminating. Just someone who has a positive message. It’s not just him, either — a tweet on former Trojan cornerback Nickell Robey’s page reads, “Don’t stress, we blessed!”
Granted, there are messages among friends on USC athletes’ Twitter pages that contain profane language, but that is to be expected. These are young adults we are talking about. But what I respect about the way USC handles its social media is that the players do not usually put themselves in a position to get in trouble.
USC is as big a stage as there is in college sports, and the athletes handle themselves as such: as role models who know there are people watching at all times. The message that “when you put something online, it is there forever” has been realized by the athletic department. The Trojans really serve as the perfect example of how social media is to be used in collegiate sports: responsibly and with the knowledge that people are always watching, waiting to see if you stumble.
The Trojans put each player’s Twitter handle on the USCTrojans.com website as a way for fans to interact with their favorite players. With a move like that, the school can’t afford to have players making mistakes.
I give a lot of credit to the athletes, coaches and sports information team for making sure the university doesn’t get docked for something a player says on the Internet. The athletic department has more important things to worry about than what its athletes are saying on Twitter. With such social media distractions out of the way, Pat Haden can focus on actual sports rather than having to go on the defensive. What a novel idea.

In a frenzied dance in the desert, the Arizona State Sun Devils had the final move. After a 3-pointer from senior point guard Jio Fontan with 0.4 seconds left in regulation helped the Trojans overcome a nine-point deficit, the Sun Devils (15-4, 4-2 Pac-12) out-executed USC in the extra five minutes to hand the Trojans a 98-93 loss.
On fire · Junior guard J.T. Terrell finished with 20 points on 7-15 shooting, converting on five out of ten three-point attempts in USC’s 98-93 overtime loss against the Arizona State Sun Devils (15-4, 4-2). – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The 93 points by USC were the most scored by the Trojans since a 93-89 win over Cal on March 6, 2008, and USC’s most points ever in a conference game.
The Trojans (8-12, 3-4) quickly fell down by four in overtime, and a pair of 3-pointers combined with a 7-8 showing at the free throw line helped the Sun Devils pull out the home win. USC had a chance to tie the game with 12 seconds down 95-94, but Fontan could not pull another three out of his hat, and Evan Gordon’s rebound for the Sun Devils sealed the deal.
Fontan tied his career high with 25 points on 8-of-14 shooting, including 5-of-9 from beyond the arc, while junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell also hit five 3-pointers en route to 20 points. In his best game of the season, Fontan scored 16 points in the opening half on 4-of-4 shooting (3-of-3 from beyond the arc) while holding ASU’s leading scorer Jahii Carson to four points in the opening half. The dynamic freshman finished, however, with 21 points.
Senior forward Eric Wise tied his season high with 19 points to go along with 10 rebounds, while sophomore guard Byron Wesley finished with 15 points.
The Trojans set a season high by shooting a blistering 15 of 28 (53.6 percent) on 3-point attempts, astonishing for a team not accustomed to relying on the outside shot. The last time USC made as many 3-point baskets was when the Trojans hit 20-of-29 in a 82-69 win over Oregon State on Jan. 28, 2000.
Gordon led the Sun Devils with a game-high 28 points, while ASU forwards Carrick Felix (16 points, 10 rebounds) and Jonathan Gilling (13-11) snagged double-doubles crashing the boards for the Sun Devils.
Nothing other than a loss will show up in the record column, but the regulation comeback was one for the ages. The Trojans could have been down for the count after Gilling nailed a 3-pointer with 2:51 left to put ASU up 78-73, but the 3-point barrage wouldn’t let that happen.
USC rattled off five quick points to cut the deficit to 80-76, and the free-throw show began. ASU’s Jahii Carson made only two of four to push it to 82-76, but Terrell hit an off-balance look from 25 feet out to make it 81-80 with 22 seconds left.
Gordon made both of his attempts from the stripe, but another Terrell attempt, this one even farther out than the previous one, somehow fell in to make it 84-82. Felix missed the front end of his pair at the line, and USC got the ball back down three with eight seconds left.
Arizona State could have fouled and sent the Trojans to the line, but  the team let USC have the final shot. After scrambling around the perimeter, Fontan leaned back and let it fly. The final result wasn’t the one he hoped for, but USC’s veteran leader likely won’t forget his overtime-causing buzzer beater any time soon.

It often seems like having fun in Los Angeles comes at a price. But this Saturday and Sunday, local museums will waive their admission fees and allow guests to explore their rich and varied exhibits. Hosted by the Museum Marketing Roundtable, 2013’s Museums Free For All Weekend promises to captivate both the casual observer and the art connoisseur on a tight budget.

With most museums open all weekend, there is plenty of time to sample Los Angeles’ finest. Both located in the heart of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art are two popular museums for Angelenos.
LACMA houses more than 100,000 pieces and is the largest art museum in the Western United States. Even though certain exhibits, such as the Stanley Kubrick exhibit, are not included with the general admission ticket, LACMA’s wares are must-sees. One notable collection is Jim Shaw’s Dream Drawings. Jim Shaw, the artist behind the drawings, utilizes multimedia and also incorporates art from the museum’s permanent Drawing Surrealism exhibit. These pieces are housed in LACMA’s new art space, the Broad Contemporary Museum.
Just a bus ride away from campus, MOCA features  contemporary artist Ben Jones’ collection, entitled Ben Jones: The Video, which features surrealistic pieces emphasizing technology and pop-culture symbols. In addition to its permanent exhibits, MOCA also features Jason Schmidt’s collection of Los Angeles artists’ photographs. This collection of portraits might act as an appetizer for the acclaimed photography that is featured in the Annenberg Space for Photography.
Even though the Annenberg Space for Photography is always free, it would be a shame to miss their current, thought-provoking exhibition, no strangers: Ancient Wisdom in a Modern World, which highlights indigenous cultures.
Another good stop might be the Museum of Tolerance, which was founded in 1993 with the intention of provoking change and encouraging acceptance across cultures. Its current exhibit, Para Todos Los Niños: For All the Children, illustrates the discrimination that Latino families faced in Southern California in the 1940s. Permanent exhibits include a haunting Holocaust section and the Tolerancenter, a multifaceted display that addresses the issue of intolerance in daily life. The entire museum provides a unique experience and casts a harsh light on the way people treat each other, yet ultimately shows that there is hope for a more harmonious society.
Serving as a nice break from the heavy themes addressed in the Museum of Tolerance, the California Science Center, conveniently located in Exposition Park adjacent to USC, includes entertaining and interactive exhibits. Though timed tickets are required to see the space ship Endeavour, there is plenty to explore for free. Besides the Air and Space exhibits, other permanent exhibits include Ecosystems, the Science Court (which features demonstrations),  Creative World and the World of Life. Both the World of Life and Ecosystems showcase the planet’s marvels as well as the resiliency and diversity of life on Earth. Make sure not to miss Creative World, the Science Center’s tribute to invention, innovation and technology. Though this hands-on museum is touted as a family destination, it will still prove entertaining and informative for adults as well as children.
Aside from these spectacular destinations, there are many other museums to pique patron’s interest and satisfy a desire for culture and art. For a more classical destination, visit the Getty Center and the Getty Villa, both of which are always free, though the Villa requires online tickets in advance. After learning about Greco-Roman culture at the Villa, stop by The Autry National Center of the American West. After visiting The Autry’s extensive collection of Native American art and artifacts, continue viewing local works at the Craft and Folk Art Museum. And for more art based on Los Angeles, the Pasadena Museum of California Art will be open as well. Other art stops include the Santa Monica Museum of Art and the University Art Museum at Cal State University Long Beach.
Not all museums, though, are free just this weekend. One notable example is the the Museum of Natural History, located right by the California Science Center; entrance is always free for students with a USC ID.

Though this weekend features witches, an obscene amount of celebrities and Jason Statham doing what Jason Statham does best, looking back, last weekend proved to be great for Jessica Chastain and a very bad week for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Mama broke out with $32.1 million over the four-day MLK weekend thanks to moderately good reviews and a PG-13 rating; the film itself skewed heavily toward female audiences and moviegoers under 25, according to Box Office Mojo. Those moviegoers having Monday off definitely helped as well.
The other film starring Chastain, Zero Dark Thirty, had a slight drop to $18.6 million and is currently hovering around $55 million.  The controversy around the film’s depiction of torture has seemingly only driven more people toward it.
The Last Stand, though, bombed with just $7.2 million, making it one of the worst openings ever for Schwarzenegger. Though it seemed to have many different things going for it, the simple truth might be that people have overestimated Arnold’s appeal. Even before he became governor in 2003, his box office draw was waning with films such as Collateral Damage and The 6th Day underperforming. Not to mention then his post-political life hasn’t been without controversy, which could have turned people off.
The 65-year-old action star does have two upcoming releases, The Tomb with fellow ’80s action star Sylvester Stallone and David Ayer’s Ten, that could change his fortune. If not, studios might be less likely to throw money behind any big-budget project of his, such as King Conan or a fifth Terminator.
This weekend sees three distinctly niche films, with each representing their own specific trend: Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, the latest “fairy tale for grown-ups”; the giga-ensemble comedy Movie 43; and the latest Jason Statham film Parker.
Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, starring Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton and directed by Tommy Wirkola, the helmer behind Dead Snow, is the latest in a run of fairy tale remakes that started with the billion-dollar success of Alice In Wonderland and shows, such as Once Upon a Time.
Regardless of whether audiences actually want to see these kind of films (the primary motivation behind these projects seems to be “look how much money Alice and/or Wicked made!”), over the next two years we’ll be seeing “darker and edgier” versions of The Wizard of Oz, Maleficent, Cinderella, Pinocchio and The Little Mermaid.
Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was originally scheduled to come out almost 11 months ago in March 2012.  Though the official reason was to wait for Renner to become more of a big name after The Avengers and The Bourne Legacy, the real reason seems to have been whether or not to release it PG-13 or R.
The studio decided to go for the R rating, and though that means it’ll be more gory and bloody, it makes you question just who this is trying to appeal to. The premise of a dark and serious Hansel and Gretel is a hard sell and it’s very difficult to strike that balance between being too silly and too serious.
It’s the same issue that befell Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and this film will likely have a similar result at the box office. Anything above $20 million would be a surprise, so expect a result around the $16 million that AL:VH got in the summer.
The other major release is Movie 43, which stars a dizzying amount of stars and celebrities. To name all of the celebrities would take up half of this column,but among the heavily featured stars are Emma Stone, Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Jason Sudeikis, Christopher Mintz-Plesse — and the list goes on and on.
The film is a collection of comedy skits — think a modern day Kentucky Fried Movie, though how all of these skits are connected hasn’t been made clear at all. It seems this is the ultimate extension of the mega-ensemble comedy that started with He’s Just Not That Into You and continued with Valentine’s Day and New Year’s Eve. It seems the only point of this film is to see just how many celebrities can be in a single feature and it almost comes across as a parody of those films.
When your audience doesn’t even know if you’re an actual movie or one of those fake trailers you’d see on Jimmy Kimmel Live, it’s a pretty bad sign. This film, which isn’t even having preview screenings for the press, will be lucky to make more than $10 million.
Then there’s Parker, the newest film from modern action staple Jason Statham. This is slightly different from your typical Statham flick: It co-stars Jennifer Lopez, it was directed by Taylor Hackford (director of Ray and The Devil’s Advocate) and it’s based on the long-running crime novels written by Donald Westlake. In fact, the novel that this film is based on was the basis for 1999’s Payback starring Mel Gibson.
Though many of his films have never really broken out, you can certainly call the man consistent. Most of his films have opened between $6 million and $12 million and there’s nothing that seems to indicate otherwise for this one.

When writers Jessica Koosed Etting and Alyssa Embree Schwartz met the first day of school at USC during their very first class of the day, neither one liked each other at first glance.
Long distance relationship · Because Etting lives in Los Angeles and Schwartz lives in Washington D.C., the writers work through Skype. – Courtesy of Jackie Blair
 
Schwartz, who hails from Virginia, was feeling homesick and Etting thought she looked too depressing to be friends with. Meanwhile, Schwartz dismissed Etting as a typical Los Angeles girl after she entered the class a few minutes late in five-inch platforms.
But one day, a few weeks into the school year, they ended up walking back to the dorms together after class and only then realized how much they had in common. They became fast friends and went on to take almost all of their classes together.
Since graduating, Etting and Schwartz have gone on to collaborate on writing projects, working on everything from television episodes to feature-length scripts together. No longer on the same campus, Etting, who lives in Los Angeles and Schwartz, who lives in Washington D.C. ,have had to get creative with their collaborations. Their latest endeavor, Georgetown Academy, which focuses on the lives of politicians’ children in Washington, D.C., was written mostly through Skype. Riding the wave of the presidential inauguration, the third book in the series is now out in stores.
Etting and Schwartz decided to write the series because they were intrigued by the dramatic world of the D.C. elite. The series, centered on the scandalous goings-on at prep schools for the teenagers, certainly doesn’t lack drama.Students are free to do whatever they please, such as exploiting their parents’ diplomatic immunity by throwing parties that the cops can’t legally break up. Still, like in any high-stakes political culture, the press holds the power to destroy their parents. For this reason, the students of Georgetown Academy abide by one rule in the novel: “Whatever you do, don’t get caught.”
Georgetown Academy will delight lovers of Gossip Girl and Aaron Sorkin alike for its insight into the glamorous and fierce world of politics. The everyday choices young adults make — from what to wear to whom to date — are chosen with careful consideration of a national, rather than personal, image. Students dress not just to impress but to distract from the secrets they’re covering up — and disobeying the unspoken dress code will surely elicit unwanted attention.
Etting and Schwartz liked the idea of writing a political drama for young adults because they felt the book’s dramatic environment might spark an interest in politics for younger readers who would otherwise be turned off by what they have seen on TV.
“The 24/7 news cycle has become somewhat of a joke in the past few years with the excessive coverage and conjecture,” Schwartz said. “It does a disservice to the younger generations who can understandably get jaded by it and tune out completely.”
Etting and Schwartz think that because of President Barack Obama’s campaign, social media’s emergence as a means of involvement and the importance of the issues our nation is currently facing, the upcoming generation is becoming more passionate about politics. Georgetown Academy characters’ close proximity to the most powerful people in the world, who are privy to political secrets that the public will never discover, might also prove interesting for those with an emerging interest in politics.
“Political families and children have always had a certain level of mystique with the American public … it’s our version of a royal family. Our book series puts a spotlight on what life is really like for these children of powerful politicians, particularly the ones who still have parents in office like the Obama girls,” Etting said.
Etting and Schwartz’s characters were inspired by political children, including Jenna Bush, Chelsea Clinton, Meghan McCain, Abby Huntsman and Bristol Palin, most of whom are now public figures in their own right.
Though they found inspiration through these and other stories of children who were raised in a political environment, many of the personality traits and settings in the series were inspired by Etting and Schwartz’s experiences during their time at USC.
“Our years at USC were even more formative than our high school years, so we got to re-live it all over again through our characters,” Schwartz said.
The two authors began their writing process by fleshing out their characters together first, then working on different characters individually. This process might appear difficult, especially because the two writers now live on opposite sides of the country, but with the help of Skype and their similar writing styles, they were able to make it work.
“We write together so easily because we always go to similar places creatively,” Schwartz said. “Half the time we’re on Skype, we barely need to talk because we know what the other one is thinking.”
Etting and Schwartz are currently writing the next addition to the Georgetown Academy series, and they are also discussing the possibility of adapting the series for film or television. Though they have many exciting things on the horizon, they still are mindful of where it all began for them.
“We never dreamed that our friendship, which began on the first day of classes freshman year at USC and entailed lots of gossip-filled meals at the Commons, would eventually lead to such a fruitful career together,” Etting said.

In the sterile environment of hotel rooms, relationships can begin, end, rekindle and be put on hold. The same room can hold hundreds of secrets, each bearing witness to different important moments in its occupants’ lives. This is especially true in Neil Simon’s play Plaza Suite, currently running at the Morgan-Wixson Theater in Santa Monica.
Three’s company · Howard Lockie (left) and Andrea Stradling (right) star in Plaza Suite, a remake of Neil Simon’s 1978 three-act play. Lockie and Stradling play different characters stuck in the same room. – Couresty of Joel Castro
The comedy, which was nominated for best play in the 1968 Tony Awards, takes place entirely in room 719 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Each act focuses on a different storyline and couple.
First, the audience is introduced to Sam and Karen, a struggling married couple returning to their honeymoon suite. Karen hopes to bring romance back to their relationship, but Sam has his mind on other things. The second act tells the story of Jesse, a Hollywood producer, and Muriel, Jesse’s long-ago girlfriend. Jesse invites her to his suite to rekindle their affair, but Muriel struggles to come to terms with reuniting with a celebrity.
And finally, Norma and Roy must go to extremes to get their daughter, Mimsy, out of the locked bathroom, just minutes before her wedding.
Each story intertwines comedy and drama, real moments and ones that are slightly absurd. As expected considering the accolades, Simon’s writing is incredibly strong in this piece, and the production relies heavily on his genius.
In most productions, including this one, each of the couples are portrayed by the same two actors, in this case Andrea Stradling and Howard Lockie. Both Stradling and Lockie do a fine job of morphing themselves into the three distinct characters they play and fully commit to the insanity that characterize Simon’s characters. It is clear they worked hard to distinguish between their various roles. However, the nuances in their performances suffer, with each portrayal becoming almost caricatures in each act. By working to make each character so distinct, they lose some commonalities of humanity — the play seems more like a self-conscious performance rather than stories of real lives being witnessed by an audience. They are convincing enough and definitely adopt each new character, but their struggles to make each character distinct leads to a loss of some realism.
Lockie, in particular, struggles with this; each of his characters feel very one-dimensional, especially his portrayal of Sam in the first act. He is still entertaining, but becomes less surprising after a while as his two levels becomes clear — intense and more intense. Both actors had issues with creating real, multifaceted inner conflict. Sam seems content with leaving his wife of 23 years, and Muriel seems merely star-struck by Jesse, not worried about what her life could become.
It is in the third act when the two actors let go, because of constant run-ins, whacking and yelling at the door to the bathroom. This is Simon’s silliness at its purest; his writing has the audience in stitches as these two characters attempt to solve one of commedy’s age-old jokes: trying to get through a locked door.
The two supporting roles are covered by Alicia Craff (Mimsy, Jean) and Karol Garrison (bellhop, waiter, Borden). Though they have limited stage time, both actors shine in their roles, particularly Craff as Mimsy and Garrison as the straight-faced Borden and a comical waiter. They are able to entertain and contribute to the plot, without stealing the focus from the rest of the story.
Despite the criticisms, it is important to note that the Morgan-Wixson Theater is the only non-professional theater in Santa Monica, a quirk which puts the performance into perspective. Simply put, it would be unfair to compare the production to a production at the Ahmanson or Pantages. These actors are not paid or part of unions; naturally the talent pool is different. And in spite of this, these actors perform with so much enthusiasm and passion that this aspect does not negatively impact the production very greatly.
The theater itself is interesting — a fairly nondescript building in the outskirts of Santa Monica, which from the street does not at all give the impression of a 200-seat theater. The wood-paneled theater and the lobby complete with knickknacks brings one back to evenings spent in a grandparent’s basement. The appearance fits the audience demographic, mostly older in age, with few under the age of 30.
The set was also a bit shabby, appearing to be entirely unearthed from a thrift store and not shined up much. The couch had sagging fabric, an odd fake wall running through the middle of the stage seemed like a cop-out and a duvet cover straight from shiny Target didn’t quite fit together. This, along with the very yellow walls, did not create a canvas as enjoyable as the actors’ performances.
Despite the somewhat cut-rate set and old-fashioned theater, the actors keep the audience laughing for the entire three hours. This was in large part because of Simon’s writing — his comic genius, 40 years later, still stands true.
 
Plaza Suite runs through Feb. 10 at the Morgan-Wixson Theater in Santa Monica. Tickets can be found at www.morgan-wixson.org

With a new landmark alliance announced yesterday, the future of healthy food for kids in America is looking brighter by the day.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
 
This alliance, between the Los Angeles Unified School District and five other major districts across the nation, aims to transform school lunches. In the wake of ever-growing concerns about childhood obesity, this fresh initiative is definitely a step in the right direction. But it isn’t all that needs to be done in the face of a very real issue in which young lives and futures are at stake.
According to the Los Angeles Times, under the alliance of major districts in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Miami and Orlando, chili cheese fries and chicken nuggets will become foods of the past in thousands of school cafeterias nationwide. These schools, which serve 2.5 million meals daily and spend $530 million annually, are on a mission to “make wholesome food a national standard,” and for good reason — a team from the University of Michigan found in a 2010 study that “children who regularly eat school lunches are more likely to be overweight or obese, and develop poorer eating habits.”
And according to the American Heart Association, about one in three American kids and teens today is overweight or obese, tripling the rate in 1963 and surpassing drug abuse and smoking as the No. 1 health concern among parents in the United States. More diet-related diseases, such as high blood pressure, Type-2 diabetes and elevated blood cholesterol, are also on the rise among children today.
Thankfully, the quest to reduce fat, sugar and sodium in school lunches has begun in earnest. The nation’s second-largest school district, L.A. Unified, has already taken lengths to ban flavored milk and overhaul the menu for more healthful dishes. The change that this push for health gives could easily become the difference between lives plagued with chronic disease and those without. Not only could it mean a decrease in childhood obesity rates, it could lead to fewer kids with psychological issues regarding self-esteem, negative body image and depression.
And yet, though improving a school menu might be life-changing, it takes more than just better lunches at school to knock negative statistics down.
Longer hours of physical education and more after-school outdoor activities would be a great help. Parents who are more committed to changing their own lifestyles could also help children make healthier choices on their own. Most of all, health education — not just starting in middle school, but earlier as well — might just make the biggest difference. Though feeding kids healthy meals might be beneficial in the short run, really informing them as youngsters about what’s healthy and what should be eaten less often would build self-motivation to be healthier with a balanced diet and exercise.
Though opponents of the new school-lunch alliance might carp on about how it’s a waste of taxpayer money and that feeding children well is a parental responsibility, it’s worth pointing out that such broad policies are necessary considering the overall implications of this national health problem. Everyone needs to play his or her part when it concerns the future of America’s health, and changes to school diets help ensure that all students benefit from a healthy foundation. The alliance is a good starting point on a path that will hopefully bring more games of four square and skies cloudy with a chance of healthier meatballs.

Tuesday marked the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of Roe v. Wade. The verdict utilized the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to protect a woman’s privacy regarding the right to choose. Roe v. Wade and a concurrent case, Doe v. Bolton, addressed the lack of clarity in state laws regarding abortion access.
The decision made in Roe v. Wade attempted to rectify the complication of two key interests with regard to pregnancy termination: women’s health and prenatal life. It was established that women should have full access to abortion services until viability. Since we have become accustomed to the issue of choice, the terminology of the decision lacks so much specificity that attempts at defining “life” have become prevalent.
For instance, viability is relative to each pregnancy and cannot be applied in a universal manner and is complicated by conceptions of personhood, as shown in attempts at limiting Mississippi’s Initiative 26. Such are the issues that arise in motions to regulate and enforce the inherent nuances of pregnancy. We have seen efforts aimed at clarifying these problems through the legal system in successive cases brought before the Supreme Court, including Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Gonzales v. Carhart.
As we attempt to coalesce action regarding an issue with two main interest camps maintaining their own distinct perspectives on the issue, we will continue to encounter issues of clarity and complications of enforcement. The values with which the groups approach abortion, when applied rigidly, are exclusive of each other.
The valuation of prenatal life over the health of the woman, for one, excludes considerations for the woman’s particular circumstance. The arrival at the decision to abort is deeply personal and regulation of access to abortion services, if any, should respect this agency. This respect for individual authority is an issue that needs to be further articulated and discussed in the public sphere as a uniting valuation we can apply to the many, multifaceted issues that manifest in our modern society.
Many are concerned with the possible actions and subsequent consequences in response to the cases previously mentioned. This inability to come to a compromise on the situation is causing a new, wider rift in our country and people’s political allegiances.
The problem is never going to disappear, and the women who are affected by the possible outcomes and interpretations of new laws face a daunting prospect. Women across the country who have aborted will gain new stigma in the event that pro-life supporters have their way, and those who revile women for discarding the budding life within them will be seen as criminals to the people who reserve the right to govern what happens within their own bodies.
Unfortunately, it seems inevitable that either way, someone is going to be left offended and nursing their ideologically driven anger.
What impacts this will have in 10, perhaps 20 years in the future are as of yet unknown until one standard is implemented. But hopefully, the next few generations will not be as offended at our indiscretions as we were to hear about how doctors once “treated” the mentally ill or how unyielding many previous generations were in accepting the reality of evolution.

Think about it…
You throw away (abort) your trash,
You flush your poop,
You toss your rags,
You ignore your responsibilities,
to your self,
to your conscience,
to your partners,
to your family,
to your offspring,
to your Maker.
YOU were never thrown in the trash…but you throw everything in the trash because of self-ishness.
You are part of the throw-away-generation. No conscience. No Truth. No God. Kinda Pathetic?
Yet another example of the Daily Trojan needing to escape hyperlink tags in the name field.
I find it very interesting and quite hypocritical that the left, lead by Obama and the Dem Party insist on keeping a Pro Choice stance, i.e., allowing a woman to kill her baby while it lives inside of her, yet these same people are trying to take away her right to defend herself and her children with a gun.
Te Roe v Wade issue has the same problem as gun control. It is not th gun that kills people. It is the person who pulled the trigger. It is not the doctor that kills th baby. It is the mothr who makes the choice to abort.
So instead of creating opposing sides to these issues, why not join together to determine what can be accomplished to eliminate the soft issues. For gun control, betteer background checks. For abortion, dont get pregnant, unless you want the baby. 
The decision to abort your baby is not to be used as a means of birth control, period. If there are other extenuating circumstances, such as rape or the li of the mother is severly at risk, then OK, but only when medically necessary.
Abortions should not be publically funded, but it has been so far, because the liberal left, who pushed for public funding wants to keep certain communities poor, uneducated and dependany on the government for financial assistance for all of their needs. These folks then become dependant on the governemtn for subsistance and will always vote for those candidates that push the agenda of big government.
Jus tknow this ki, that us older folks were your age at one time, and we’ve learned through our mistakes thqt life is precious and should’nt be messed with. So get you birth control pills, use condoms, whatev other means to have fun while young, but abortion is NOT to used as a means of birth control.

All over the news, we’ve been hearing about Manti Te’o’s unfortunate situation – the Heisman contender recently found out that his long-term girlfriend, who was presumed to be dead, never existed to begin with.
As if we didn’t already know, the Internet has become a vital medium in which society interacts with one another: From instant messaging with strangers to keeping up with Grandma, it can now be done all with the simple tap of the trackpad. On top of this, it’s perpetuated the most important human relation of all – love, for better or for worse.
The Internet is incredible for connecting couples in long distance relationship. However, it can also become a tool in which people hide behind the shield of anonymity that a computer screen provides. The Internet fails at the honor system, and more often than not we find people seriously abusing it.
To each couple his or her own, but it’s safe to say that actual togetherness, meeting face-to-face, is vital to success. What romantic relationships hold differently from friendships is that relationships really involve a physical aspect (no, not that kind).
Whether we’re straight, gay, lesbian, or transgender, aren’t we all in the same boat trying to find somebody to love us and be with us for the rest of our lives? That’s what the whole dating game is all about. But in such a fast paced world, we need to be careful in seeking such instant, superficial connections.
And by no means do I mean offense to Manti (please don’t squash me with your pinky toe), but the vice of online relationships has increased exponentially with the growth of the Internet. When will it become common knowledge that finding companionship through a screen may not be the premier choice?
If you can dip it, don’t stick with it
“When will it become common knowledge that finding companionship through a screen may not be the premier choice?”
Common knowledge isn’t so common. In fact, people can be just downright dumb when it comes to online “love.”
