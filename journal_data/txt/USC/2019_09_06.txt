The LGBT Resource Center and Lavender Lounge will move its offices to the fourth floor of the Student Union later this semester, LGBT Resource Center Director Kelby Accardi-Harrison confirmed Aug. 30. 
According to Accardi-Harrison, the move, which does not have a finalized date, is the result of years of administrative decisions that led to student protests and organizational complaints regarding size of the office space.
According to Monique Allard, who served as interim vice president of student affairs until Winston Crisp assumed the position Aug. 16, the Resource Center will lose approximately 27 sq. ft. in its new office space on the fourth floor. According to Allard, the relocation will situate the Resource Center and Lounge alongside the Center for Black Cultural Student Affairs, the Latinx Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs and Asian and Pacific American Student Services. 
“All of the cultural and resource centers, otherwise known as the Student Equity and Inclusion areas, have been working toward providing more intercultural and intersectional programming to support students’ multiple identities,” Allard said.
According to Allard, students who utilize the LGBT Resource Center often frequent the other student cultural resource centers, placing great weight on the importance of recognizing diverse identities as a reason to relocate the LGBT Resource Center.
According to Accardi-Harrison, the decision to relocate the center and Lavender Lounge with the other cultural organizations is a step in the right direction and indicates improved administrative coordination with the Resource Center.
“I do think it’s meeting a need by creating a better, more hopeful space in the sense of intersectional identity,” Accardi-Harrison said. “I honestly feel the administration feels the same way. Ideally there would be more square footage”
According to Accardi-Harrison, the Division of Student Affairs discussed this move for a few years and had kept the Resource Center notified of the decision’s progress. Accardi-Harrison said she provided feedback to Student Affairs and discussed the center’s long-standing troubles with the current office size.
“We definitely want to be on the fourth floor, but even losing a small amount of square footage is going to be very difficult in terms of our operations,” Accardi-Harrison said.
The Resource Center has a history of notifying the administration about the problems with limited office space. According to previous Daily Trojan reporting, the Resource Center had the chance to move offices and expand their square footage, but it eventually lost the chance due to administrative choice.
Former Executive Director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly Alyssa Coffey told the Daily Trojan that the LGBT community members staged a protest in disappointment with the decision. According to Coffey, when students suggest ways in which they can be better supported by the administration, no action ever results, alluding to this as a “bureaucratic spiral.”
The current director of QuASA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
In 2015, Accardi-Harrison released a comparative study of LGBT Resource Centers at numerous top academic institutions that found USC’s to be the smallest of its kind.
“[Our] space is not just small. It is embarrassing,” Accardi-Harrison said in a previous Daily Trojan article.
The Lavender Lounge sits at around 270 sq. ft., nearly twice as large as the Resource Center’s 169 sq. ft. According to Accardi-Harrison, the lounge is a student wellness space for queer and allied students to meet up, study and relax. 
The Lavender Lounge also serves as an educational resource and is filled with history pamphlets, LGBT flags and other decorations that are meant to be identity affirming. Accardi-Harrison verified that these features of the lounge will move with the new space and provide a place of comfort for students.
“For the clubs and [organizations] that can meet in that space, it is going to have all of the brochures, the history [sic], the flag,” Harrison said. “Everything that makes the center feel identity-affirming.”

Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin take on this year of change as the Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president, respectively. Though the student leaders took office in April, they have set an agenda of ambitious goals for the year, which includes improving student wellness, stressing University-wide sustainability and increasing dialogue with University administration.
They have led the University since the end of the last academic year, after campaigning as a write-in ticket on promises of student representation, increased administrative accountability, improved student resources, a reconfigured health and safety system and an open campus climate.  
When Stone and Tahsin first joined USG in 2017, neither of them expected to run for an elected position — let alone for president and vice president. Stone proposed the idea of joining the election as write-in candidates last January after only one ballot, former USG Senators Michaela Murphy and Meagan Lane, entered the race by the initial deadline. He partnered with Tahsin, and the two hoped to provide another option for students come the election.
“We really wanted to be the best that we could for the student body and focus on the student experience and perspective, more so than we’ve seen in the past,” Stone said.  
Stone, a junior studying international relations and philosophy, and Tahsin, a senior studying business administration and economics, have previous experience working together within USG’s funding branch. Tahsin served as the director of the professional and academic fund, where Stone applied to be a delegate in September 2017. Stone was also a senate aide in the legislative branch at the time. 
“It was so cool to see the amount of resources and the amount of people that were engaged with student government,” Stone said. “We have almost 500 people that will touch our organization in some way this year, and to see all of them so passionate about a similar mission was so impactful to me.”
One year after her starting with USG, Tahsin was brought on to serve as the director of the discretionary fund, and Stone took on her previous position heading the professional and academic fund to provide funding for events programmed by student-run, undergraduate organizations.
“Both of our backgrounds within USG were within the funding branch, which allows you to see a lot of different interests of students through one specific position,” Tahsin said. “And I think that really helped us understand how to work with students, administrators, or any different parties and make sure that we are pushing forward the students’ interest first.” 
Stone highlighted the presidential search committee as an example of the lack of student representation in administrative decisions. Stone and former Graduate Student Government President Joycelyn Yip were later included in the provost search committee that recently announced its decision to appoint University at Buffalo Provost Charles Zukoski.  
“Everyone seems adequately represented on the provost search committee,” Stone said. He said that including students in the decision is effective and feasible. 
One of Stone and Tahsin’s first actions of the semester was to formalize Trojan Council, a group composed of leaders in USG, GSG, Academic Senate and Staff Assembly. The group plans to hold an open forum with University President Carol Folt and other administrators this semester.
According to Stone, this council would be able to play a larger role at USC by prioritizing the voices of faculty, students and staff when making decisions.
“You can’t have all 20,000 undergraduates at the table, but you have a vice president and president that were popularly elected by them,” Stone said in a previous Daily Trojan article. “And that applies when it comes to staff and faculty, they’re all elected and can hopefully adequately represent their constituents.”
Stone said there have been a number of scandals in the past within USG and USC that have distracted from the mission of the undergraduate experience and thrown USC into national scrutiny. 
But Tahsin said issues like the college admissions scandal — which was revealed in an FBI investigation in March right before the start of her and Stone’s term — drive her and other students to create change at USC.
In light of these incidents, she said USC has been working to “break out of the silos that exist to push forward a more united value system.” Stone said there has been an upward swing in administrative accountability and a drastic increase in the inclusion of students — both from USG and from other groups — on committees, task forces and in the general conversation. 
Stone and Tahsin have also worked throughout the summer to plan their agenda for the new school year.
Stone and Tahsin worked with the Office of Student Affairs to reduce the amount of fees student organizations pay for facilities when they host events. The partnership helped them set aside $15,000 in waiver fees for organizations to draw from throughout the school year. 
USG also launched diversity and sustainability training Aug. 30 that requires recognized student organizations to send five representatives to participate in these trainings and take exams to show what they learned. USG also hopes to make a system where branches of USG can collaborate to form task forces in order to address various campus issues. 
“It might be something like an incident of sexual assault or a scandal, but it could also be a long term advocacy project like expanding Lyft hours,” Stone said. He said that they are working on pairing these student task forces with administrative ones, so they can work hand in hand on tackling these campus issues. 
Stone and Tahsin are also focused on improving wellness initiatives across campus. One of these efforts include working with the Campus Wellbeing and Education Office to implement Ask Ari, a virtual wellness assistant platform that answers questions for students, faculty and staff.
Other efforts to improve student life include increasing direct funding to registered student organizations, expanding free Lyft hours depending on what time the sun sets and improving the Trojan food pantry, which will move from Parkside Apartments to a space next Cafe 84.
“It’s going to have a big industrial kitchen,” Stone said. “It will also have a Director of Student Wellbeing who will be able to help students register for things like CalFresh and connect to different resources in the community.”
Truman Fritz, USG senior director of communications, said he aims to improve accountability and transparency in USG to encourage more students to express what improvements they would like to see.
“We really want to emphasize that USG [is] here for you, we are your student government, we represent you, all 20,000 students,” Fritz said. 
Fritz and the rest of USG believe in the importance of fostering an environment in which students have a source to go to with their problems, where every student’s voice is heard. 
After partnering with Auxiliary Services last year to hold a composting pilot program in select residence halls, Sustainability Director Isabella Caltabiano said USG will implement multi stream waste bins in freshman residential colleges. She hopes to eventually install the multi-stream recycling, waste and compost bins in all residential colleges. 
“On top of that, I’m looking to collaborate with President Folt and find ways that we can make USC more sustainable on a greater scale. This will be the first time we have the administration really backing us and propelling us forward,” she said, referring to Folt’s background as an environmental scientist.
With new administrators including Folt, Zukoski and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp, Stone and Tahsin said they hope to see USC transform its value system to help students, faculty and staff feel more included and informed, and that the culture of the University begins to shift.
“Everytime we come back, we have big events, we go to the football game, we feel proud to be Trojans — but there have definitely been issues over the last couple of years that have eaten away at the pride for a lot of people,” Stone said. 
Ultimately, Stone believes that there are a lot of the right people in the right positions forming good relationships that together can help bring that pride back for everyone.

Should professors share their own political opinions? This topic comes up a lot in the first couple of weeks of class, especially in today’s polarizing political climate. The answer is easy: Of course they should speak from a place rooted in their own views. 
It is ridiculous to argue that professors who confess their own beliefs are actually telling their students what to think. We are all old enough to not get brainwashed. People should be encouraged to share their views without being accused of projecting them. College students are impressionable, but not overly impressionable. A 2012 research study from the American Association of University Professors shows that students are not simply indoctrinated by professors. It’s laughable to think professors would hold back their own views for fear their students cannot form independent opinions. 
This is not to say that professors should be fervently ideological. For instance, professors leaning left should be able to ask students in a political science class to ponder the salient arguments for conservative ideals such as those expressed in an originalist reading of the Constitution or to think critically about liberal ideas like affirmative action programs. A business professor should be able to talk about the potential pros of increasing corporate income taxes. Professors still have the obligation to offer myriad fact-based, competing, valid views presented respectfully. That can be done while still including a little bit of personal perspective.
Though this is a generalization, it seems to be mostly right-wingers who harp on professors who express their views, stereotyping them as self-advantageous, narcissistic, “social justice warrior” professors trying to proselytize the youth with their liberal propaganda. If conservatives are so mad that liberals are waging a war on college campuses, why not get in the mix? If conservatives are afraid of political homogeneity on campus, why not introduce their own views into classroom discussions to broaden the perspective of the conversation? These political perspectives should not be discussed as one-and-done showboat performances that are sporadically put on by attention-seeking, pseudo-conservative sensationalists like Ben Shapiro.
Conservatives should contribute to the conversation in an intimate and lasting way throughout a semester or college career. But many conservatives do not want to do that. It makes one wonder whether or not those who refuse to espouse their beliefs aloud want to be held accountable for them. There’s a reason the “silent majority” is silent. If you are not proud of your opinions, it may be time to re-examine them. 
College is an important time to garner bits and pieces from several new worldviews. People need intellectual sparring partners to refine their own opinions. Yes, the discrepancy between political parties on most campuses is large. USC is no different, a mecca of highly educated people in southern California, a notoriously liberal state with Los Angeles serving as an increasingly liberal city. That’s not to say that there are no conservatives here. There are bound to be right-leaning professors in every academic discipline at USC. Conservatives should encourage open political discourse in the classroom. It is necessary for the formation of solid opinions. We all have biases, and it is important to be cognizant of them. People change their ideas all the time. When new information comes into the picture, peoples’ views change; that is impossible without a free exchange of ideas. 
For those, however, who think partisanship is going to lead to this country’s demise, across-the-aisle debates professor-to-professor, student-to-student and teacher-to-student should be increased. The point of debate is to share an inquiry and explore ideas. In that exploration, it’s harder to villainize the “other” side if it is someone you know and can respect. And with debate moving more onto online platforms, it is essential that people get confronted in person over their beliefs to remember the rules of engagement. It’s much easier to be thoughtful and considerate when you cannot hide behind an anonymous username and a laptop screen. The in-person debate should happen at any age, to any person, regardless of profession or power dynamic. It makes our democracy better, plain and simple, to have ownership over our beliefs. 
The world is a political place. For many students — DACA students, black and brown students, LGBTQ+ students and so on — their mere existence has become political. To say political views do not belong in the classroom is a privileged viewpoint because, frankly, everything is political. The classroom should be preparing students for the outside world, not shielding them from it.

With rising tuition and living costs rendering it difficult for lower-income students throughout California to afford stable housing, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state legislature are combating California’s homelessness epidemic among college students. Senate Bill 568, written earlier this year, would establish a “college-focused rapid rehousing” program, requiring campuses that receive state funding to work with a homeless service agency to provide students access to local housing. While the bill ultimately stalled in the state legislature, the momentum it created across the state prompted Newsom to allocate a record $52.9 million to combat homelessness, housing insecurity and hunger on California’s public university and community college campuses — with the exception of private universities like USC.
Because USC does not receive state funding, the University is not affected by the recent flurry of activity in Sacramento. The issue’s prominence presents the opportunity to raise awareness and promote dialogue regarding student homelessness at USC. Homelessness is an issue that impacts the most vulnerable in our community, further highlighting the dichotomy between the University’s vast resources and the struggles its low-income students face. 
While student homelessness is not regularly acknowledged by much of the USC community, former USG Director of Community and External Affairs Mai Mizuno relayed to HuffPost that “a significant amount — an alarming amount — of students said they faced an issue of homelessness in the last year” based on an exploratory survey distributed to some students, though no concrete numbers have been released. 
According to a 2018 study by researchers at Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab, college students affected by homelessness devote as much time, on average, to class and studying as their peers who are not affected by homelessness. However, according to lead researcher Sara Golrick-Rab, they also “work more, they commute more, spend more time taking care of other people and they sleep less,” resulting in weaker average academic performance and lower graduation rates than the rest of the nation’s student population.
No student at any university should face homelessness or housing insecurity, but the problem seems particularly egregious at USC considering the wealth associated with the University and its community. In recent years, USC has regularly secured annual fundraising hauls in the hundreds of millions. The University has implemented some programs to serve the students affected by homelessness, such as the USC Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness, which is aimed to address general homelessness in Los Angeles but also listed responding to USC student needs as one of its goals. Additionally, Trojan Shelter, a home for college students experiencing housing insecurity, only houses 12 students per school year. 
A major issue thwarting universities’ attempts to address homelessness on their campuses is that homeless students often feel ashamed of their plight, resulting in an aversion to seeking help and taking advantage of available resources. This phenomenon is likely magnified at USC, where low-income students’ modest lifestyles are contrasted by some of their peers’ staggering wealth; it is not difficult to imagine that students affected by homelessness fears of stigmatization are heightened in this environment. To mitigate this problem, campus leaders and high-profile administrative officials must acknowledge that student homelessness is a problem at USC and unequivocally state that the University community is supportive of homeless students and the campus resources available to them.
According to student testimonies published in an April HuffPost article about the USC homeless student population, some students resort to sleeping in USC Leavey Library if they cannot find a spot on a friend’s couch. The fact that California lawmakers are taking concerted action to combat the homelessness problem in state universities and community colleges should motivate USC, with its superior per capita financial resources, to support its homeless student population in a similarly dedicated manner. With tuition and housing costs rising, the University must address housing insecurity among students affected by homelessness.

USC football is getting ready to take on No. 23 Stanford at home Saturday with sophomore starting quarterback JT Daniels out for the season with a torn ACL and meniscus. All eyes will be on USC’s new starting quarterback — true freshman Kedon Slovis. 
Having already beat out redshirt junior Matt Fink and redshirt sophomore Jack Sears for the backup job during his short time at USC, Slovis should not be taken lightly. It might be a rocky start during his first few games, but he impressed against Fresno State by remaining collected despite being thrown into a high pressure situation. 
The key for Slovis, a talented player with impressive fundamentals, will be gaining experience. Saturday was his first time competing at the college level, and suddenly he’s been thrust into the role of QB1.
USC’s Air Raid offense is meant to be simple. With a true freshman anchoring the offense, coaches will need to maintain that simplicity. Head coach Clay Helton emphasized that the playbook is still wide open for the team as he expressed confidence in his new starting signal-caller. 
“Kedon’s going out there to lead our football team, and I don’t want him looking over his shoulder,” Helton said. “He won the number two position. We had a hurt quarterback and [Kedon’s] going to walk out there and be the No. 1 quarterback.”
USC will not be the only team on the field starting its backup signal-caller, though. Stanford senior quarterback K.J. Costello has been ruled out after a hard hit to the chin during the Cardinal’s victory over Northwestern on Saturday. Junior Davis Mills will take the reigns in Costello’s absence.
Stanford junior offensive tackle Walker Little sustained a leg injury last Saturday and will definitely not be on the field this weekend — or the next five games after that. Having been named first team All-Pac-12 last season as a sophomore, this is a significant loss for the Cardinal.
This week, the Trojans placed an emphasis on tackling and forcing fumbles, and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga said physicality will be the team’s focus against Stanford.
Hufanga, projected to have a big year after recovering from the broken and re-broken collarbone that cut his 2018 season and spring camp short, showed his potential with eight tackles against Fresno State and has already provided a glimpse into that physicality.
“We’re just playing fast and playing free,” he said. “And trying to put a simple defense together, so we can go out there and execute.”
Stanford plays good situational football, and its pro-style offense is different from what the Trojans faced during spring and fall camp. Beyond that, the Cardinal have a strong downfield passing game.
Stanford tends to mix different personnel groups, meaning it could play several different combinations of fullbacks, tight ends and wide receivers at the line of scrimmage. The biggest challenges for USC will not only be those personnel matchups and formations, but also getting a feel for how Stanford executes its plays, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. 
Pendergast was pleased with the effort he saw on the field Saturday against Fresno State.
“[I] was really happy with the rotation we were able to go with up front on the defensive line. I think that paid off,” he said. “It’s nice to see waves of guys go out there at one time and get productive plays out of them. I thought the back seven at times worked well together, and at times that’s an area where we need to continue to improve.”
USC defensive line coach Chad Kauha’aha’a noted Stanford recruits to its strength: its offensive line. Though Mills is not the Cardinal’s regular starter, he should not be disregarded by the Trojans. The one thing the USC defensive line needs to clean up from last week, Kauha’aha’a said, is corralling the quarterback. 
“[Stanford head coach David] Shaw is a master offensive mind, so whatever situation they’re in, they’ll have them ready,” Kauha’aha’a said. “So we have to take that approach, whether it’s the starting All-American in there or the number two, number three offensive lineman in there, we take the same approach.” 
A lot is uncertain in this upcoming game against Stanford, not only in terms of quarterbacks but also how USC as a whole will play against a powerful Pac-12 team. Athletic Director Lynn Swann said USC’s goal this season is to win the Pac-12 championship. This first week of conference play should provide a sign as to whether or not the Trojans are capable of doing that.

As I prepare to draft the team that will defend my 2018 Fantasy Football championship and place the Mayfield name next to the likes of Belichick and Lombardi, Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon has my attention as a potential late-round steal.
Normally, a player of Gordon’s caliber would be taken many rounds earlier than I plan on drafting him, but his current financial situation has him in a position where he feels forced to hold out from reporting to his team. The concept of a young talent refusing to display his ability over financial disagreements is nothing new. In fact, rapper Lil Uzi Vert is going through similar circumstances in a completely different industry.
The correlation between a 6-foot-1, 215-pound NFL running back who makes a living sacrificing his body and a 5-foot-3, 150-pound rapper that gets paid to shoulder roll with sass may not seem obvious, and understandably so. That is the main purpose of this column — to point out the parallels that exist within music and sports. In his hit track “Thank Me Now,” Drake raps, “I swear sports and music are so synonymous, because we want to be them, and they want to be us.” This column is dedicated to highlighting those synonymous structures.
Since entering their respective fields, both Gordon and Uzi Vert have been the cream of the crop in comparison to their peers. Gordon has finished top 10 in the league in total touchdowns in three of his four years in the NFL. At 135,000 first-week sales, Lil Uzi Vert’s official debut album, Luv Is Rage 2, is the best-selling album of any rapper featured as an XXL Freshman, an annual list dedicated to spotlighting the year’s most popular rising rap stars, since 2013 and has been proclaimed by The New York Times as the leader of the SoundCloud wave.
Along with achieving clear quantitative success, Gordon and Uzi Vert have become major cultural figures early in their careers. 
Thanks to his confident demeanor and childlike purity, Uzi Vert is one of the most recognizable personalities in all of rap, and Gordon has garnered more than his fair share of fans from carving through defenses on Sundays.
However, impressive stats and the allure of fan attraction has yet to equate to the type of money the young stars feel they deserve. 
Uzi Vert has been extremely vocal about his displeasure with his deal under DJ Drama and Don Cannon’s Generation Now label, going as far as blaming them for the yearlong delay of his sophomore album, Eternal Atake. He announced his retirement from music altogether in early 2019. 
Meanwhile, Gordon is facing similar displeasure with his Chargers contract, as he pursues a deal that would place him among the top-paid backs in the league — a number currently north of $13 million per season. As part of his pursuit, the 26-year-old running back has been a training camp and preseason holdout with no definitive signs of return.
Neither Gordon nor Uzi Vert seems close to the deal they want. 
Chargers general manager Tom Telesco announced that extension talks will be shut down until the end of the season, via Daniel Popper. In a similar manner of calling the “little guy”’s bluff, DJ Drama responded to Uzi’s claim that the label was holding Eternal Atake by posting that Uzi has his blessing to drop the album whenever he pleases.
Gordon and Uzi Vert have proven to be at or near the top of their respective professions and want nothing more than to be paid like it. The concept of a person outperforming their previously signed contract and earning a raise in response seems straightforward, but what should be a straight line to the bank shifts into a steep hill for those in the exploitative industries of football and rap. 
As I sip from a 99-cent gallon of water for dinner for the second night in a row, I recognize that trying to paint a picture of a millionaire athlete and a millionaire artist being financially exploited is unlikely to spark much sympathy. Still, the fact that two elite talents will likely be forced to perform under a contract signed without leverage deserves at least an acknowledgement of their relatively unfair treatment. 
The sad truth is that both Gordon and Uzi Vert are expendable in the eyes of their bosses. The Chargers have enough talent on their roster surrounding veteran quarterback Philip Rivers to ease Gordon’s absence. While Uzi Vert, much like Gordon, is a top-tier talent, a new rapper pops up for every realization that school is hard, making the idea of DJ Drama betting on the field seem more logical than breaking the bank for one artist. 
Gordon and Uzi Vert not earning what their resumes are worth is the unfortunate reality of two industries that operate using the same cycle: build up, underpay, tear down, repeat.

The No. 4 USC women’s soccer team looks to remain undefeated as it faces off against two non-conference opponents — Northern Arizona and Nebraska — this weekend.
Coming off a thrilling overtime win against defending champion Florida State, the team shows no signs of slowing down. Despite its impressive start to the season, though, junior forward Tara McKeown believes there is still room for her team to grow.
“I think that there is always something that we can work on and improve,” McKeown said. “During that [Florida] game, we focused a lot on getting our width and moving the ball … I think we executed that well.”
The Trojans should move the ball in McKeown’s direction if they want to be successful on Saturday. McKeown was named both the National Player of the Week and the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for her performance last weekend. She was involved in every score against Florida State, scoring the first 2 goals and assisting on the game-winner. McKeown has now scored in every game this season and has already tied her 6-goal total from last season.
Although the Trojans beat one of the nation’s fiercest opponents in Florida State, McKeown says they will not rest easy in their preparation for Northern Arizona.
“[Florida and Florida State] were really big wins for us so it’s good to have that in our back pocket,” McKeown said. “This whole week at practice we have just been focusing on doing the things that we have been doing well and continuing that into [the game against] NAU.”
While Northern Arizona is unranked, it might prove to be one of the Trojans’ toughest opponents yet. The Lumberjacks are coming in with a two-game win streak, a 2-0-1 overall record and last week’s Offensive Player of the Week junior forward Paige Maling.
Maling took seven shots — including five shots on goal — in 80 minutes of play on Sunday and scored 2 of NAU’s 4 goals against Detroit Mercy in less than two minutes. She already has doubled her offensive production from last season in the first three games.
Head coach Keidane McAlpine said that containing Maling would be one of the most important factors in his team’s success on Friday.
“What we try to do is to take away what they like to do [and] limit her touches, which will limit the crosses into the box,” McAlpine said. “If we’ve got the ball, they can’t score.”
McAlpine also said that along with slowing down Maling, the Trojan defense must hold up under the consistent high-pressure approach of the Lumberjacks.
“Their style is very [much] push the ball forward, go, go, go, try to get high pressure, lots of pressure,” McAlpine said.
The Trojans will go on to face Nebraska Sunday with the hope of extending their winning streak to six games. Nebraska has gotten off to a sluggish start, especially in terms of scoring. The Huskers average less than a goal per game this season, while their opponents are scoring more than 2 goals per game. In their last two matches, Nebraska has struggled to score in the second half, resulting in a loss and a tie. 
Given their track record this season, the Huskers will step on the pitch with a chip on their shoulder and something to prove, so the Trojans must remain ready.
“The key for us is the consistency in terms of our work rate and our aggression and in terms of how we compete,” McAlpine said. “If we start there then we allow our technical ability, our talent, our individual skills to show up on the field.”
The Trojans will kick off against Northern Arizona 3 p.m. Friday before facing off against Nebraska noon Sunday. Both games will be at McAlister Field.

Coming off a disappointing 1-3 loss at No. 3 Texas, No. 15 women’s volleyball is seeking redemption in this weekend’s UNI tournament where they will face No. 12 Kentucky, No. 23 Creighton and Northern Iowa.
Last season, the Women of Troy hosted the tournament and won all three of their games. This time on the road, head coach Brent Crouch hopes to win again. Crouch said the Trojans are one of the teams to beat entering this year’s tournament following its successful run last season.
“All those teams are looking to crush us, the tournament itself is really special, but they’re all going to be ganging up on us,” Crouch said.
Although the Trojans are highly ranked coming into the tournament, they will be short-handed.
Senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier is not able to play this weekend’s tournament due to injury, and the team is sure to feel her absence. Lanier currently leads the Trojans with 36 points on the season. 
“We [still] have some injuries,” Crouch said. “The goal is just to get a little better every weekend and have some different lineups out there again. That will be great because we’ll give [players] some experience who haven’t played that much, [including freshmen].”
Although the team has been plagued by injury, Crouch expressed confidence in the Trojans’ ability. The tournament roster will feature new rotations and fresh faces including freshman outside hitter Kalen Owes.
The Trojans captured their last meeting against No. 12 Kentucky 3-1, moving to an all-time record of 5-1 against the Wildcats. 
With a career record of over 1,000 kills, senior outside hitter Leah Edmond of Kentucky will be difficult to contain. Edmond, the 2018 SEC Player of the Year, ranked 13th in the nation with 4.57 kills per set last season and is Kentucky’s all-time leader in kills and attempts in the 25-point scoring era. 
“[Edmond] will be someone that we will target,” Crouch said. “We want to make life really hard for her and make her receive every single serve that she’s out there. That’s a hard load, to both pass and hit.”
Crouch also explained how it is necessary to be able to be effective at trapping — a method in which two blockers defend a shot. 
The Women of Troy will be in Northern Iowa’s territory this year and are hoping to win another game against them to improve their record to 7-1.
Crouch said it will be a challenge to hand the Panthers a loss at home but will encourage the girls to play their best and continue with the “positive vibes.”
USC’s third matchup this weekend is Saturday against No. 23 Creighton. The Trojans won the two teams’ previous matchup in five sets last season.
Crouch said doing well in all the matches and “allowing less room for error,” is key to winning this weekend, as the Trojans look to take the tournament for the second year in a row. 
The Trojans’ tournament run will begin 3 p.m. Friday against Kentucky. USC will then go on to face Northern Iowa and Creighton Saturday.

On a warm Wednesday night, crowds poured into the School of Cinematic Arts’ George Lucas Building 30 minutes early in anticipation of  the “It Chapter Two” early screening. Spirits were high, and chatter filled the concourse. Doors finally opened at 6:30 p.m., and they were promptly closed six minutes later as the room had already reached maximum capacity, cutting off more than half the line. 
Twenty-seven years have passed since the murders in the town of Derry chronicled in the first film. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) still lives in Derry and, upon learning about the recent uptick in murders, he calls for a reunion of his childhood friends — making up the Losers’ Club — to defeat Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), who is back and stronger than ever. Director Andres Muschietti seamlessly switches between the summer of 1989 and present day, highlighting the parallels between youth and adulthood, however similar yet dramatically different  they may be. 
The sequel sees the once-misfit children entirely abandoning their lives as successful comedians, screenwriters and insurance agents to fight off the evil that has been lurking in their hometown. The reunion enforces the first of many testaments to tradition and friendship that have shaped the two films. 
Once the present-day Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Bill (James McAvoy), Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) and Ben (Jay Ryan) assemble, evil begins to present itself. At a happy-go-lucky reunion dinner, small demons appear, eerily crawling out of fortune cookies. Though the group immediately looks to fleeing the city for good, they quickly realize they are all bonded by the traumatic events of their childhood years. This shared trauma drives the film forward as the group upholds the collective responsibility of protecting its hometown from existential terror.
Eventually, the group discovers how to defeat Pennywise: Each individual is forced to search for a token of their youth to sacrifice in an ancient ritual. Alone and ready to wrangle with their personal demons, each  member encounters a different experience with Pennywise as they search through their childhood trauma in hopes of finding a way out. 
As Richie searches for an arcade token to offer as a sacrifice, he faces his most scarring experience from his childhood. Richie (whose younger self is portrayed by Finn Wolfhard) recalls playing in the arcade and, after he beat a boy in a game of “Street Fighter,” he was made victim to homosexual slurs and felt isolated by his opponent. 
The scene circles back to middle-aged Richie at the park, and Pennywise makes an appearance, revealing that he knows Richie’s biggest secret: his sexual orientation. Richie’s storyline adds depth to one of the most well-known thriller narratives; more than facing a fear of clowns and zombies, coming to terms with one’s true self can prove to be the most challenging task. Walking the line between this emotional subplot and comedic relief, Hader delivers a stellar performance. He eases the film’s jump scares with witty remarks, inciting loud chuckles from the audience.
After much turmoil, the group realizes that in order to defeat the demon, they must convince him that he is mortal and small. This aspect of the film is the most bizarre; at one point Pennywise transforms into a Titan-sized creature only to be defeated by a group of self proclaimed “losers” simply calling him a clown. As an overall fight scene, the last effort to defeat Pennywise may fall short of a Hollywood dream ending, but what it represents makes up for a lack of action. What the audience sees at the end of the film is a group of grown individuals fulfilling a childhood promise to no longer be afraid, satisfying the plot and speaking volumes on the significance of overcoming one’s biggest fear.
The abstract means of defeating a massive Pennywise-crab hybrid perfectly summarizes the themes driving the “It” franchise: Friendship and confidence, once again, defeat the mightiest of demons. No matter how much of a leap of faith director Andy Muschietti expects the audience to make, it was fitting for the film to conclude in this manner.
As a whole, the film offers much more than is expected from a frightening yet silly summer horror film. “It Chapter 2” beautifully captures a sense of nostalgia in the form of a bike ride on a summer day, as well as an excellent reminder of friendship; these individuals, despite losing connection for what could be a lifetime, immediately were willing to put their lives on the line in the name of a sacred bond formed in middle school. Although on a much more life threatening scale, this message should hit home for each audience member and make the film all the more enjoyable.

Michael Bocanegra’s music pursuit started when he threw out his clarinet in middle school. Frustrated with all the teasing, he left it in a locker on the last day of school, something he now regrets, though it ended up launching his music career. 
If it weren’t for that moment, Bocanegra, who took up the stage name Lilbootycall, wouldn’t have the skyrocketing rap career he has today.
“If I never threw away that clarinet, it wouldn’t have sparked that want to pursue music,” he said. 
With his experimental first mixtape, “Jesus Said Run It Back,” LBC puts it all out there. Just as he is during the interview, his tracks are candid. He’s not shy to talk about his personal battles, and he calls himself “a motivational speaker for those who want to give up.” 
In fact, his stage name comes from him feeling like he was a last-minute “booty call” after his friends’ — and girls’ — original plans would fall through.
The album ignites with “Bandaid,” where he raps “I been scared to die, so I just drive to every state / They all filled with lies, diamonds over heart, it ease the pain,” and “No one care about the kid, but ay man its ok / I don’t need no ass up in my face to see the cake.”
To kick off my column, I chatted with the San Antonio native about his music,  his work with one of my favorite artists, Cuco, and what makes this 22-year-old kid with colored hair so relatable. 
Oh, and my favorite song off his new album is roadtrip-staple “Mariah.”
Talk to me about growing up in San Antonio.
Being a young kid, I grew up in not the best area, so music and art was really praised over there. 
All I really had was music to make you feel anything. I’d listen to the radio by your bed, because there’s nothing to really do outside. And if there was stuff to do outside, your parents wouldn’t let you go out.
You collaborated with one of my favorite artists, Cuco. How was working with him?
So I’m sitting in my room in San Antonio, and I get a DM, and it’s him: “Yo, bro I have a show tonight in your city, I want you to come out.” I was like “Oh shit, that’s lit! For sure. I’mma come out.” I go to the San Antonio show and I meet him, and we’re just chilling in the green room — I came here just to watch a show or whatever, so just to meet him was dope. But then he goes, “Yo are you trying to perform tonight?” Everything was set up already and they knew what they were doing. So I was like, “OK, bet.”
That was the first time I ever really performed in a big crowd. At the time I was doing shows, but only like 15 to 20 people were coming. And he had a sold-out show. The fact that I played “Sailor Moon” and everybody in the city went crazy for me, it just opened my eyes. After that, he asked me to come to Dallas. We went to Dallas, did the same thing and people went crazy. Eventually, I sent him a beat and we made stuff. 
Since you mentioned “Sailor Moon,” that’s one of the top songs you have out. What’s that song brought on for you?
To be honest, I hate that song now. I hate that song so much. It’s the one that people try boxing me in on. Like I said, I’m an artist: I like creating different things and exploring and doing what I want. 
I just felt like the fact that people really enjoyed that song so much, that’s all they wanted to hear from me. People were trying to keep me in this style forever. In reality though, if you listen to all my music, each song is different from each other. Literally no one can find my music and be like, “this song sounds like this.” None of my songs sound similar. That’s what I think.
Do you really still hate it?
I really got over the “Sailor Moon hating stage” because, you know, I’m on tour right now for my album. I play my old music and nobody really knows it, which is crazy. I kind of outgrew my old fan base, which is lit because they really helped establish me, but it’s the fact that I want to continue to grow and change. 
I did a bit of a Twitter and Insta stalk. To be honest, you seem relatable. Is that just you being you?
I really be going through it sometimes. Like mental issues and shit. It catches up to me no matter how successful I get or how much money I get. I’m not even there yet. There’s still so much stuff to work on. I’m still a human at the end of the day and I still think about things. I still fall in love. I live everyday like everyone else.
What you just said about mental health, like that shit, nobody talks about it. The fact that there’s people like you that are okay with saying that, it’s important.
Yeah. With everything, there are pros and cons to it. A lot of people like that I’m relatable because I speak about that. But then, the cons is that there’s so many people that tell me to shut up and call me a crybaby. Everybody on the internet acts like they’re emotionless. Everyone wants to be savage or whatever.
What is cool about your music is that I can’t compare it directly to someone else’s. I think that’s pretty dope. Going off of that, who have been some of your inspirations?
When I was younger, probably Juicy J. That’s why I collabed with him on the album. [Note from me: they sing together on “18K,” a light piano-backed track that truly sets the mood for the whole album.] I felt like it was a necessity. Paul Wall. Mike Jones. And a lot of Southern artists. And recently, Lil Uzi, Post Malone, Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino, Kid Cudi for sure. Travis Scott, Kanye West, Big Sean. When you really think about all those artists, they are just themselves and they’re not afraid to create. 
I just watched your video for “Prescriptions,” where you write a prescription and the thing you ask for appears. It’s kind of dope, not gonna lie. What’s something for you in your life now that you wish you could just write up and get it?
Probably real love. It’s so easy finding somebody. But it’s not easy finding somebody that likes you for you. There might be somebody out there that likes me for what I’m doing, or how I look, or my social status. But it’s like nobody really knows the real me. The person I show on the internet isn’t me completely. I just wish I could find somebody that would take the time to know me for me.
So the column is called “You Should Stan.” Why do you think people should stan Lilbootycall?
People should stan me because I’m myself. I’m a motivational speaker for people that want to give up. And I feel like, everybody in the world, no matter what race or how tall you are, what size or what your ethnicity is, everybody has wanted to give up. Everybody has given up in certain ways. I wanted to give up a lot so I’m glad to be that person to encourage people not to give up.
Do you feel that you’re at a point now where you can say you can’t give up anymore?
Yeah. I be talking to my manager a lot about that. Like, he keeps telling me, “Bro, this is way bigger than you now. You just can’t give up now.” Like, like I said a motivational speaker. Like, if you give up, you have thousands of kids looking up to you. He was the one that was pushing me to do better. It’s at this point where I just gotta keep going. Ain’t no giving up.

Less than 30 seconds into describing his thesis film “The Gatekeeper,” director and USC graduate student earning an MFA in Film and Production Jordan Martinez was already comparing it to Vincent Ward’s “What Dreams May Come” and Clint Eastwood’s “American Sniper” — a rather jarring hybridization. However, the more details Martinez shared, the more the two projects’ crossbreeding made sense.
“The Gatekeeper” is a 17-minute military thriller starring Christopher Loverro and Jennifer Marshall. “Awakening in a war-zone on the precipice of life and death, an Army First Sergeant confronts the causatum of his own orders to see his family again” reads its logline — after over a year of detailed, in-house production and post-production at USC, Martinez is excited to share it with the community.
“[The Gatekeeper] is a timely type of film, and it’s an authentic film,” Martinez told the Daily Trojan. Due to the film’s harsh subject matter, Martinez and his team were careful making sure that everything both in front of and behind the camera was handled with as much nuance, authenticity and understanding of military life as possible. 
Loverro is himself an Iraq War veteran and former SWAT Officer. Just like her character in the film, Marshall is a military wife, as well as a former Navy Officer. Active Duty Marine Corps are featured in the film. In addition to using real decommissioned military uniforms, the project was shot partially on-location near Edwards Air Base, a place Martinez himself used to jump out of planes during his time in the army. 
Martinez’s Command Sergeant Major Daniel Stroud — who served with Loverro overseas seven years earlier — also helped with critical aspects of production. Both a craftsman (who helped Martinez “literally [see] things together”) and an adviser, using 20-plus years of expertise to capture protocol as true-to-life as possible, Stroud was one of the many veterans who showed passion and support for Martinez’s piece. 
“We tried our best to [include] the veteran community,” Martinez said. “[The film] focuses on veteran issues: integrating back into society, trying to adjust.” As  Martinez was speaking, one of his visual effects artists and a graduate student in mechanical engineering, Pang-Wei Yen, walked past and validated that most creative input for the film has come from people with military backgrounds. 
“I’m from Taiwan … Every male [has] mandatory military [service] for one year over there,” Yen said. 
He noted that his service was definitely different from Martinez’s, but stated that the team is working to make sure that the war aspect of the film is authentic right down to the composites. This authenticity is what begs the “American Sniper” parallel, but it’s the focus and ambition with special effects that Martinez likens to “What Dreams May Come.” 
“Right now, it has … from my understanding, the most amount of special effects out of any USC film I’ve ever known — especially as far as war special effects.” Martinez said. 
Every course Martinez has taken at USC so far has been incorporated into this project in some shape or form. From Michael Finks’ “Directing In A Virtual World” to Visual Effects Supervisor of “John Wick Chapter 3” Robert Nederhorst’s “Live Action Integration With Visual Effects,” classes — all Martinez’s coursework has been building up to this thesis film. 
With the guidance of professor John Brennan, all of “The Gatekeeper” was shot using motion capture previsualization, a cinematographic game plan to help a film crew visualize complex scenes before filming. “Motion-capture previsualization” is usually reserved for films like James Cameron’s “Avatar” and Steven Spielberg’s “Ready Player One,” blockbusters with at least $100 million budgets. 
Although Martinez acknowledged that the production process was “grueling,” he remained committed to the film’s important themes throughout.
“I wanted to make a film that really could speak to veterans…and [helps] civilians understand the complexities of what [veterans] are thinking and what they’re going through,” Martinez said. “There are artistic sides to veterans … There’s lots of [war] stories that people need to tell and want to tell and people want to hear them.”
 “The Gatekeeper” will be screened this December at USC before it makes its way through the fall festival circuit.
