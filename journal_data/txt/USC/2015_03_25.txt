Shiza Shahid, a 25-year-old social entrepreneur who cofounded the Malala Fund, spoke about the importance of empowering girls through education on Wednesday afternoon.
The event was co-sponsored by Speakers Committee and Political Student Assembly.
The event began with a presentation by Shahid, followed by a Q&A session moderated by professor Fran Seegull, an adjunct professor at the Marshall School of Business, followed by a meet-and-greet.
Shahid quit her job after Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban for campaigning for girls’ education and rights and co-founded the Malala Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to break the cycle of poverty and empower girls through education.
The Malala Fund has been promoting secondary education for girls in six countries, including Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Sierra Leone and Kenya. Forbes reported that the organization has raised $400,000 in funding, half of which came from the World Bank and the other half from Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
During her presentation, Shahid showed a CNN news video of the summer camp in Pakistan she planned for girls, including Yousafzai, to inspire them to better advocate for the change that they believe in.
“I was really excited about engaging with students here because it’s a great university and has an emphasis on entrepreneurship,” Shahid said. “I was excited to see a lot of international students and women in the audience. I’m really excited to see some of these students go forward to create social businesses and nonprofits that take on social issues.”
Due to her efforts in advocating for young girls and their education, Shahid was recently named one of TIME’s “30 People Under 30 Changing the World” and one of Forbes’ “2015 30 Under 30: Social Entrepreneurs.”
Joshua Chang, marketing director of Speakers Committee, said that he hopes attendees use their education in an impactful manner.
“It’s important for USC students to attend because some of the USC students are entrepreneurship majors and they could see an example of what they could do with their majors,” Chang said. “She’s a great role model for students to look up to.”
“I loved how her call-to-action was for everyone. Whatever your passions are, whatever your background is, you can affect change wherever you are,” said Olivia Chui, a sophomore majoring in business administration and communication.
Merhawi Tecle, a senior majoring in political economy, said the talk empowered women and encouraged the pursuit of dreams.
“Being a brother of three sisters, I’ve always seen my parents, even though they’re very supportive, to wish me to do well and follow my dreams but to my sisters that they should eventually have a child and live up to these female responsibilities,” he said.
Shahid wanted to inspire others through her personal stories and experiences.
“I hope students walk away with some thoughts to reflect on in terms of their own life choices,” Shahid said. “I always share my personal stories because I want to talk about the experiences that I’ve had and students can reflect on their own journeys and what they’re passionate about, what they want to do with their life and what they’re empowered [by] to make a difference.”

The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and Marshall School of Business hosted American businessman, investor and NBA team owner Mark Cuban at Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday night. Cuban shared his approach to business, investing and how to live a compelling life to the capacity crowd of USC students, alumni and faculty.
Mark Cuban, an active investor in tech and media ventures, has an extensive entrepreneurial career as founder of broadcast.com and owner of Landmark Theatres, Magnolia Pictures and the Dallas Mavericks. Cuban is also one of the “sharks” on ABC’s hit show, Shark Tank, which features a panel of investors who evaluate offers for investing in the products or businesses of aspiring entrepreneurs.
In the event, which was helped put together by title sponsor Blackstone LaunchPad at USC, Cuban addressed the stereotype that often comes with being in sales, such as the entrepreneurs pitching products on Shark Tank.
“When people say, you know, ‘Oh, how do you do sales?’ I ask, ‘Are you into helping your customers? Are you into telling people why your product would service some good?’ Because if you can’t do that, you’re in the wrong spot,” Cuban said. “If you don’t believe you can sell your product [and] if you don’t believe it’s a great product, then it’s time to close the doors. There has never been a company that has survived without selling.”
Cuban, a native to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said that he’s been a hard worker since he was a child. He recounted how he began his entrepreneurial career at 16 years old when he bought a stamp at a stamp fair for 50 cents ,and later found someone who told him that stamp was actually worth $50.
After developing an interest in business, he went to Indiana University because it was the cheapest out of the top 10 undergraduate business schools in the United States. At IU, Cuban was able to finish a year and a half of his MBA before beginning his junior year because of the lack of restrictions on class registration. He attended the university for four semesters before the dean of the business school realized he was an undergraduate student taking graduate-level courses.
Cuban used this example to stress the importance of challenging yourself.
“No one has really ever changed the world or changed an industry by just doing what everybody else was doing,” Cuban said.
He said that the biggest lie entrepreneurs tell themselves is they are superior over certain situations.
Cuban said that the real successes usually come out of the development of products or services that are completely different and turn the industry upside down.
Cuban also offered advice regarding the importance of customer service.
“There’s never been a business that could survive without customers,” he said. “That’s just the way business works, and I have a saying that you have to re-earn your customer’s business every single day. And I try to, no matter what the business or what position I’m in. If your customers leave, what do you have left?”
He went on to talk about his experience with broadcast.com and how after the biggest IPO jump in the history of the stock market, he eventually sold the website to Yahoo for $5.7 billion.
Not long after, Cuban attended a Dallas Mavericks game on opening day and was disappointed that the game was not a sell-out. With his newly acquired wealth, he decided to buy the Dallas Mavericks and change the attitude and the culture of the franchise. As a result of some changes made by Cuban, the Mavericks went from a record of 21-32 to 49-57.
At the end of the discussion, Mark Burnett, a British television producer and the chief executive officer of United Artists Media Group, joined Cuban to talk about his show Shark Tank. Burnett and Cuban, both described the show as a sort of “new age lemonade stand.”
Siqi Wu, a senior majoring in business administration said that he enjoyed hearing advice from an entrepreneur with a lot of experience.
“The parts [when] he talked about Shark Tank and his interactions with USC entrepreneur teams made me think a lot because that is the reality that we are confronting every day,” Wu said. “It’s probably something I will experience in the future, whether I just have an interview where I have to sell myself or I am starting my own business.”
Editor’s Note: This article has been updated to note that Blackstone LaunchPad at USC were a title sponsor and organizer of the Mark Cuban event.

USC benefactors Mark and Mary Stevens have donated $50 million to officiate the creation of the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute.
The endowment will be used to expand the understanding of the human brain and enable researchers to discover new ways to treat, prevent and cure brain disorders. The Institute will be led by professors Arthur Toga and Paul Thompson.
The funds will also enable the researchers to undertake more high-risk and high-reward projects, collect preliminary data and recruit additional top faculty.
According to USC News, researchers plan to accelerate the translation of basic research into new therapies, preventions and cures for brain injury and diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury.
Toga sees the endowment as an opportunity to look at more unusual types of relationships.
“For example, are there things that occur when people are young, early in life that affect them later in life?” Toga said.  “Those are lifelong investigations that are extremely important in terms of understanding reduction of risk for neurological or psychiatric disorders or ways in which we can improve brain health.”
The institute and its Laboratory of Neuroimaging was originally brought to the Keck School of Medicine in 2013, to unite a team of more than 130 faculty and scientific staff members. The institute represents a diverse group of faculty from around the world who are acclaimed leaders in examining the brain’s structure and function in health and disease.
According to USC News, the institute has recruited a large group of global scientists to pool resources in “reverse-engineering” the brain. Specifically, the institute will study the ways in which they can learn to map and understand how its structure plays into its function.
The institute was among the first to map the spread of Alzheimer’s disease in the human brain and to create digital 3-D and 4-D brain atlases to examine the effects of neurological diseases.
The institute is known for the world’s largest repository of healthy and diseased brain images, along with medical and cognitive data from diverse populations around the globe.
It will continue to partner with the Viterbi School of Engineering, and other faculty in biology, genetics, biostatistics, computer science, mathematics, pharmacology and numerous other disciplines.
President C. L. Max Nikias said that the funds will be used to explore a captivating new field.
“Neuroscience has been called ‘the final frontier’ in medical science’s progress toward a fuller understanding of human life and human health,” Nikias told USC News.  “Through the Stevens’s support, USC researchers will have the opportunity to address many of the most pressing questions in medicine today.”
Students will also benefit from the endowment as it creates a more interdisciplinary learning experience for students on both campuses.
Toga said that overall, the donation is going to be most beneficial for students.
“We’ll have more and interesting projects that students can participate in and those are the type of experiences that are great for students because it engages them in a kind of science they really wouldn’t have an opportunity to see otherwise,” Toga told the Daily Trojan.
As longtime USC benefactors, Mark and Mary Stevens have made lasting impacts in areas ranging from engineering and innovation to now medicine and the life sciences.
“The gift from the Stevens is unbelievably bold,” Toga said.  “For him to have the vision and the level of commitment not only to USC but to this institute, I think that’s a testament to the excellence of USC and his recognition of not only how good we are, but how good we can be, how much better we can be.”

USC mailed out decision letters on Tuesday for students accepted into the graduating class of 2019. Of the 51,800 students who applied, 9,050 were granted admission.
USC boasts its lowest acceptance rate in history at 17.5 percent, down from last year’s 17.8 percent.
Timothy Brunold, dean of undergraduate admission, said the type of students that were offered a place in the university were exemplary candidates.
“The students who have just been invited to join the Trojan Family have it all: fantastic academic preparation, impressive patterns of involvement and leadership, incredible diversity — in every sense of the word — sincere academic curiosity and an eager willingness to tackle the world’s toughest problems,” he said.
Most of the admitted students were part of the top 10 percent of their graduating class. Their average unweighted GPA was 3.83 on a four-point scale, and they scored above the 95th percentile in their SATs.
Half of the students who have been accepted took more than eight Advanced Placement courses during their high school career.
The admitted students also represent a diverse set of ethnic backgrounds.
While 44 percent of the admitted freshmen are from California, 42 percent represent 49 states and U.S. territories. Fourteen percent of the students come from 77 foreign countries, with the most represented countries being China, India, South Korea, Canada and Singapore.
Twenty-three percent of the students are also from underrepresented minority populations. Eight percent are black, 13 percent are Latino and 2 percent are Native American/Pacific Islander, making USC one of the country’s private research universities that enrolls the most underrepresented minorities.
Some of the admitted students will form part of the inaugural class of the USC Glorya Kauffman School of Dance. Three-hundred and fifty students applied, and only 20 will pursue their bachelor of fine arts in the new school.
The class of 2019 will also be inaugurating its new music production program under the Thorton School. Under this program, students will be able to pursue a bachelor of music.
One of the students accepted, Alli Loynd, hopes to major in biological sciences and French. While she was in high school, she created a district-wide program that brought high school students to her districts’ elementary schools to teach English as a second language.
“I saw a lot of ESL students feeling lost and ignored, so I am really proud that I have potentially made some of these kids’ lives easier by helping them with their English, but most importantly, showing that people care about them,” Loynd said.
Caleb Collins, a senior in high school, is one of 10 students who were admitted into the program. He said that he always knew he wanted to work in the music industry.
“I always knew that Thornton was a top program — one of the best in the country — so I decided to apply. I have listened to music since before I could talk and music is all I want to do,” he said.
Collins attended Grammy camp for a jazz session and was a winner of a YoungArts award, an award that recognizes young artists in literary, design and performing arts.
Students who have not yet received their admission decision should expect to get their admissions packages within the next few  days. The university will also post decisions online.
Brennan said USC still chooses to send admissions decisions through the mail to emphasize the importance of the students’ accomplishment.
“Admissions decisions are overwhelming and we want our announcements to be a family moment,” Brennan said.
Students will have until May 1 to decide whether they will be attending the university.
awesome write up and interview

The No. 9 USC men’s golf team is heading to Stanford to try and grab its fourth win of the season at The Goodwin, which runs today through Saturday.
Sophomore Rico Hoey and freshman Sean Crocker will lead the Trojans as they take on a field composed of 22 other schools, with five from the Pac-12 — host and defending champion Stanford, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado and Washington State.
The event kicked off for the Trojans at 7:30 a.m. this morning at the Stanford University Golf Course, a par-70, 6,727-yard course. Over the course of the event, teams will play a total of 54 holes, 18 each day. On Friday, the Trojans start play at 12:15 p.m. The tee times for Saturday will be determined by the team finishes in the first two rounds of play. The last time USC won the event was in 2008; former Trojan Rory Hie took home the individual title as well.
In the Trojans’ last outing, they finished ninth with a 3-over 867 at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters from March 9 through March 11. Crocker led the team with a fifth place individual finish with a 7-under 209 (70, 67, 72) — his third straight top-5 finish.
Crocker has had a fabulous start to his collegiate career. In his first nine outings, he has recorded a team-best 15 rounds in the 60s. He is currently ranked No. 5 in the 2015 Palmer Cup rankings. In June, the top six golfers from the United States and Europe  in the final rankings will make up part of the 10 golfers chosen to participate in the Palmer Cup from June 12 through June 14.
Crocker also leads the team in stroke average (69.81). In the last three outings, Crocker was the Trojans’ top finisher — something he’s done five times this season.
Hoey has the team’s second-lowest stroke average at 70.38 and has shot 11 rounds in the 60s. An All-American in 2014, Hoey has five top-five finishes this season, his best coming at the Bill Cullum Invitational, where he finished second with a 12-under 204 (65, 67, 72).
In the first watch list for the 2015 Ben Hogan Award — presented to the nation’s top men’s collegiate golfer from the NCAA Division I, II, III, NAIA or NJCAA — Hoey was one of 24 NCAA golfers chosen. Notably, Hoey is one of only seven underclassmen on the list.
The other starters for the Trojans consist of seniors Paul Smith and Eric Sugimoto, junior Bobby Gojuangco and freshman Jonah Texeira.
Smith’s season-best was a tie for third at the Gifford  Collegiate-CordeValle with a 7-under 206 (67, 73, 66). He has had two other top 21 finishes.
Sugimoto has put up two     top-15 finishes, his best being a tie for ninth at the Southwestern Intercollegiate with a 3-over 216 (72, 76, 68).
Gojuangco’s best finish of the season was a tie for seventh at the Bill Cullum Invitational with a 5-under 211 (68, 71, 72).
Texeira, similar to Crocker, is having a great collegiate debut. With a stroke average of 71.89, he is third on the team. At the Bill Cullum Invitational, Texeira recorded an 11-under 205 (67, 66, 72) to finish third.
Together the team will look to top their ninth place finish at their previous outing.

After defeating the defending champions, No. 3 Pepperdine University (6-2), in a 3-2 victory on Tuesday, the No. 1 ranked Women of Troy are set to face off against St. Mary’s and Cal State Bakersfield in Merle Norman Stadium.
The Women of Troy have a 7-0 record and are off to their best start in program history. This week, however, is extremely hectic for the Women of Troy as they have six duals on the schedule. After Thursday, the Women of Troy head to Arizona to play against New Mexico, Grand Canyon and Arizona State.
While this schedule may be tough, sophomore Sara Hughes has found a way to handle the rigors of the season.
“Since our season is so short it is brutal,” said Hughes. “It’s hectic and not easy but we have to go to the training room. We have to take ice baths and be in with our trainer. It’s all about up keeping our bodies and maintaining our health.”
While Hughes and her partner Kelly Claes have had an excellent start to the season winning the pairs tournament in Hawaii, they suffered their first loss of the season against Pepperdine.
Even though these upcoming opponents may not be highly ranked, head coach Anna Collier knows that they will be challenging.
“Both teams are going to be smaller and will rely more ball control,” said Collier. “We are used to teams who are big up front. They will drop a lot of different kind of strategies that we don’t see.”
Cal State Bakersfield has a 6-2 record, but their two losses came against Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount. Thus far the No. 1 pairing of redshirt senior Mariah Alvidrez and senior Molly O’Hagan has been very consistent, winning six games. While the Bakersfield Roadrunners only have one player over the height of six feet in sophomore Sydney Hayes, they make up for lack of height in their style of play. They are extremely reliable defensively, and they find ways to score points.
St. Mary’s has had a slow start to the season, with a 3-4 record. They began the year ranked No. 8 in the country but after two losing streaks, they have fallen out of the rankings. The Gaels utilize the strategy of having several players who play both indoor and sand volleyball. Unlike the Roadrunners, the Gaels have a number of players that are over six feet tall. Their top pairing senior Samantha Tinsley and junior Dalas Dodd are living up to the bill by winning six of their seven matches for Gaels this season.
One of the most crucial pairings for the Women of Troy is their No. 3 pair with graduate student Meg Norton and senior Eve Ettinger. Norton transferred from UCLA and continues to gel with her new teammate.
“I think we are still improving on team chemistry cause we are really good friends but we haven’t played together for very long, since I am new this year,” said Norton. “When we are connected in a match that is when we play our best.”
The first dual match on Thursday starts 3 p.m. against the CSU Bakersfield followed by another dual match at 4:30 p.m. against St. Mary’s.

I’m disgusted and I’m sure much of the rest of the Trojan faithful are as well. Of course, the culprit of this this bad taste in my mouth is once again, the hypocritical institution that is the NCAA.
I don’t even think that ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith has enough four-syllable words to describe my repugnance for the NCAA’s abhorrent actions and dialogue.
I couldn’t believe some of the things I read while sifting through the hundreds of pages of documents stemming from the 2011 defamation lawsuit brought by former USC assistant coach Todd McNair against the NCAA, which were finally unsealed and made public on Wednesday.
At least now we know the reason why the NCAA had their lawyers fight so hard over the years to prevent all of these confidential emails, memos, interview transcripts and other records from being unsealed.
A couple of my professors, who both happen to be USC alumni, were so appalled that they even brought up the subject matter for discussion in my business law and accounting classes.
The audacity that Shep Cooper, who was simply a liaison to the NCAA’s committee on infractions, had to call McNair a “lying, morally bankrupt criminal” with absolutely no grounds and using that as justification for why he shouldn’t be coaching at any level is absolutely ludicrous.
In a memo to the members of the committee on infractions, Rodney Uphoff, the NCAA’s coordinator of appeals at the time, wrote that the evidence in the case against USC is “markedly stronger than in the Oklahoma City bombing case, which was built entirely on circumstantial evidence.” He even went on to claim that there was no direct evidence that Terry Nichols, who set a Guinness World Record after being convicted of 161 counts of first-degree murder, was ever involved in the bombing plot.
Uphoff also claimed in an email to Roscoe Howard, who sat on the committee,  that he had lost sleep because he feared that the committee would be too lenient.
I would lose sleep, too, though if I held the belief that a serial murderer may have been innocent, though not because a prestigious institution was going to possibly get off easy for not controlling its players.
Let’s remember that all of these people mentioned above had no voting power.As seen from their statements above, however, they seemed to have an agenda to make an example out of both the   Trojans and McNair.
The two NCAA staffers compared McNair and USC to a convicted felon, and in turn, the school was unfairly treated as if it also were sitting on trial for first-degree murder.
These fallacious conceptions arose from attempts to basically influence the jury, which, at the end of the day, was the committee.
I’m not a legal expert, but it’s my understanding that in a court of law, it is unlawful for any outside source to unduly influence the jury.
Nonetheless, it’s considered an act of misconduct when jurors allow the wishes or beliefs of an outside source to influence their decision-making.
Based on the type of communication in these documents, it’s apparent that this type of misconduct definitely took place leading up to the committee’s final decision.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Frederick Shaller echoed this message after ruling in November 2012 that the NCAA was indeed malicious in its investigation of McNair.
I’m not certain about the rules and protocol that the NCAA follows in these investigations, though if something is for certain, it’s that USC was unfairly tried and fell victim to the personal bias of several NCAA employees.
If there’s something we learned on Wednesday, though, it’s that the NCAA has always been the true criminal throughout this whole saga. And thanks to the courts, I’m glad that the rest of the nation is now finally able to see excerpts of this criminal activity in ink.
The tables surely have turned and oh, the irony of it all. The NCAA cited USC for its lack of institutional control, but after reading these documents, it actually seems like it’s the NCAA who needs to be put on a leash.
I’m sure that the USC Office of Athletic Compliance — perhaps the best in the nation at what it does — would gladly offer its assistance, though. At least, we can thank the NCAA for something.
The sanctions are now something in the past, but no one will forget the way the NCAA treated USC throughout this entire process.
The fact that the Trojans’ punishment was handed down almost five years ago and we’re still having these conversations is an exact representation of that.
If anything, McNair should be seen as a USC hero, for if he had never filed his suit in 2011, most of us would have never been exposed to the specific acts of wrongdoing committed by the NCAA.
Though USC and its fans now have some closure regarding everything that took place, I believe that this party is only getting started. Now  more than ever, the NCAA’s credibility is being put into question, and it might finally be time for its member institutions to take a stand.

Coming off the program’s first Pac-12 conference title since 1979, the USC men’s swimming and diving team will look to make a splash to end the season at the NCAA Championships, which kick off on Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa. The event will run through March 28 when a national champion will be crowned.
USC has previously won nine NCAA team titles and 117 NCAA titles, which are both good enough for fourth most nationally. It’s been a while since the program won a national team title, however, with the last one coming all the way back in 1977. It will also be looking for its first top-three finish since taking second in 1990.
Led by senior Cristian Quintero, the Trojans (6-2, 6-1 Pac-12) seek to put an end to that hiatus and will attempt to do so with the 13 swimmers and four divers they are are sending to the championships.
Quintero, who won three individual races at the Pac-12 Championships, is the defending NCAA champion in the 500-yard free and also played an integral part in the Trojan’s 800-yard free relay title last year. The Venezuela native is the top seed in the 200-yard free after finishing second in 2014 and currently sit as the second and fourth seed  in the 500-yard free and 100-yard free, respectively.
Quintero will be crucial to the Trojans’ success in relays at the NCAA Championships after  anchoring the team’s Pac-12 titles in the 400-yard free and medley relays, in addition to the 800-yard free relay.
USC is seeded second in the 400-yard medley and 800-yard free relays and third in the 400-yard free relay. They are seeded just outside of the top-five in the 200-yard medley and free relays.
Head coach Dave Salo, now in his ninth year at the helm of the men’s and women’s programs, returned seven All-Americans in 2015 including Quintero, along with senior backstroker Luca Spinazzola, senior breaststroker Sergio Lujan Rivera, junior butterflyer and sprinter Maclin Davis.
Salo also has the fortune of having an All-American bundle of sophomores in freestylers Dylan Carter, Reed Malone and Santo Condorelli.
Sophomore Steven Stumph also won his first title in the 200-yard breast at the Pac-12 Championships and is seeded third in the race in his first NCAAs.
Another young talent is freshman Ralf Tribuntsov, who is the top seed in the 100-yard backstroke and will look for USC’s first win in the race since John Naber won the event four straight times from 1974 to 1977.
The Trojans are also making some noise from the diving boards. For the first time in school history, they are bringing four divers to the championships.
Senior divers Jordan Gear, juniors Collin Pollard and Deon Reid and freshman Dashiell Enos will all be taking part in their first NCAAs.
Prelims for the Championship will begin at 9 a.m. each day with the finals capping off the day at       5 p.m.

On Tuesday morning, the NCAA unsealed hundreds of emails, memos and transcripts that seem to show ill will and bias toward both USC and former running backs coach Todd McNair.
“These recent documents confirm what we’ve believed all along, that we were treated unfairly in this investigation and its penalties,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said in a statement on Wednesday. “I think these documents are cause for concern about the NCAA’s own institutional controls.”
The NCAA had battled to keep the documents sealed by claiming that making them public would inhibit the committee’s ability to conduct investigations in the future.
“It should be concerning to all schools that the NCAA didn’t appear to follow its own rules,” Haden said.
McNair sued the NCAA for defamation, and his attorneys argued the emails showed that certain officials tried to influence the infractions committee. California’s 2nd District Court of Appeal ordered the NCAA to release the documents in Feburary.
The emails seem to prove McNair’s case and show why the NCAA was so concerned with keeping the documents sealed. Two non-voting members, Roscoe Howard and Rodney Uphoff, attacked both the Trojans and McNair in the emails. In one email, Uphoff even compared evidence from the Reggie Bush case to the Oklahoma City bombings.
“This evidence in this [Bush] case is, for example, markedly stronger than in the OKC bombing case which was built entirely on circumstantial evidence,” Uphoff wrote, according to CBS Sports.  “In fact, there was no direct evidence that [Terry] Nichols was ever involved in the bombing plot.”
Another infractions committee overseer, Shep Cooper, went as far as calling McNair “a lying, morally bankrupt criminal and a hypocrite of the highest order.”
USC was sanctioned in 2010 for a “lack of institutional control” in cases regarding former football player Reggie Bush and basketball player O.J. Mayo. The Trojans were handed a  two-year post-season ban and a massive reduction in scholarships over the subsequent four years. Many consider the punishment put on the Trojans to be one of the harshest in history.
The NCAA pinned McNair as one of the main contributors to USC’s mishandling of their star players. The NCAA claimed that McNair “knew or should have known” about Bush’s relationship with potential San Diego agents. McNair ended up losing his job at USC in 2010 and has not worked for another team or college since.
In voice memos released as part of the sealed documents, Uphoff harshly criticized USC’s hiring of Lane Kiffin following the departure of Pete Carroll.
“Paul Dee was brought in at Miami to clean up a program with serious problems. USC has responded to its problems by bringing in Lane Kiffin,” Uphoff wrote. “They need a wake-up call that doing things the wrong way will have serious consequences.”
Some members of the committee, including Britton Banowsky and Eleanor Myers, were skeptical about the case, especially against McNair.
“It is challenging for me to make the finding when there is no allegation that he personally was involved in any rules violations, or even had specific knowledge of any,” Banowsky wrote.
The NCAA released more than 500 pages of documents on Tuesday. A decision regarding McNair’s defamation lawsuit should come within few months.

Instagram, Twitter, Vine and Facebook are all some of the most influential and effective platforms of social media. Whether they are posting funny videos and beautiful photos or tweeting witty quips, an individual can gain fame from social media.
Instagram is probably one of the most widely used of these platforms due to its aesthetically pleasing nature. A picture is worth a thousand words, and by that logic, one can share stories as long as War and Peace on the platform. Most people have a few hundred followers consisting of friends and acquaintances that like to share photos of their latest vacation or their fancy coffee of the day through pictures. Instagram also poses, however,  as a platform to encourage and spark fame.
Many of the most popular Instagram accounts belong to celebrities such as the Kardashians and Taylor Swift. These stars get millions of likes on posts about mundane things in their lives. Despite the apparent celebrity takeover of Instagram, there are several individuals who have made themselves famous due to photographic talent that sets them apart from other users.
Though vanity seems like a superficial way to become famous, it is usually the first thing one would think of when listing those who are “Instagram famous.” Many models get their start on Instagram by racking up huge amounts of likes on their pictures, simply because of their  good looks. Model heartthrob Matthew Noszka, for instance, was discovered on Instagram through his popularity among female users.
Other social media stars have gained notoriety through avenues other than looks, however. The MagCon boys, a group of young teenagers including Nash Grier, Jack Johnson and Jack Gilinsky (who perform as Jack and Jack), and Cameron Dallas, gained popularity on Instagram via their popularity on Vine, a social network that allows users to post six second videos. These boys all started small, posting funny videos of themselves doing silly things around their neighborhood. The videos on both Vine and Instagram soon developed into a display of the boys’ talent, such as the musical performances by Jack and Jack.
Humor is a powerful driving force in the art of becoming Insta-famous. Funny celebrities like comedian Chelsea Handler continue to rack up some of the highest number of likes on Instagram through their creative ways of making people laugh. Some accounts are based solely on humor like @PassengerShaming which shows pictures of rude things people do on planes. @BaddieWinkle is another famous Instagram account created by an older woman who embraces her younger side. This account features “Grannie” wearing Kanye West shirts and throwing up peace signs, a sure fire way to make your day better — and, at the same time, increase her likes.
Los Angeles-based artist Amalia Ulman was so interested in the phenomenon of Instagram fame that she decided to make herself part of “celebrities of social media.” She spent time studying and analyzing the most popular Insta-stars in order to create an alter ego that was the perfect prototype of social media popularity. In just a few months, her account, which was based off the most widely accepted and popular accounts on Instagram, quickly gained 65,000 followers, demonstrating just how cookie-cutter the path to becoming Instagram famous can be.
Being a human being is not a prerequisite for becoming a star on Instagram either. There are many animals that have become some of the most famous individuals gracing the Internet. Everyone knows Grumpy Cat and Boo the Dog, but there are even more animals that have more followers than some celebrities. Biddy the Hedgehog continued to be a favorite Insta-animal until he passed away this past March 1 leaving behind a legacy of more than 300,000 followers looking at pictures of him taking a bath and eating his daily meal of worms. Marnie The Dog, another new addition to the Insta-fame world, is a funny-looking little dog who has warmed the hearts of millions.
Cats have seemed to take over the Internet in the last couple of years, including the ever cranky Grumpy Cat. She even gets paid now for events and meet-and-greets. Pudge the Cat is also a contender for the most famous cat of Instagram award with 50,000 followers.
Whether you are a gorgeous model looking for a break, a talented teen with some cool skills or a cuddly creature that is just perfect at being adorable, Instagram fame is really about the viewers and fans. Without the rest of the Internet looking, liking and sharing pictures of these famous individuals, Instagram would be nothing more than a family photo album. Celebrities, Viners and pets alike are what make being Instagram-famous as part of our current era of internet takeover so unique.

My first coherent thought during my spring break was “Where am I?” At 5 a.m. on the first Saturday of break, I crawled into a van with six strangers and promptly fell asleep. I didn’t fully wake up until late afternoon, surrounded by towering red rocks and fading sunlight.
The theme of “Where am I?” continued throughout the trip, whenever I took the time to look around and consider my surroundings. I spent nearly the entirety of the week on USC Volunteer Center’s Alternative Spring Break trip, on the Navajo Reservation located in the Four Corners Region — Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
I wasn’t expecting the trip to spur such a sense of incredulity. I assumed that the destination’s relative closeness to California meant it wouldn’t be that different from home. I’m still not sure exactly what motivated me to sign up for the trip. I was drawn to the idea of a “service learning” trip, and the specific activities — trail restoration and working with youth — stood out to me. Additionally, I’d missed the deadlines for all other ASB trips, and viewed the fact that the Navajo application was available later as pure fate.
Regardless of location, all spring break trips are just that — a break, an escape from the grind of schoolwork. From napping at home to partying in Cabo, all spring breaks are essentially created equal, even though it may not seem like it based solely on Instagram posts.
Prior to the trip, I thought of it almost as a “working” experience. I assumed it would be a week full of hard work, with little time for rest or reflection. The Navajo Nation trip, however, is neither a simply traveling experience or a dedicated service trip, but a cultural immersion experience.
The cultural immersion aspect of the trip meant that we didn’t visit the Navajo Nation, we experienced life on the reservation. We learned the Navajo language, devoured Indian tacos and participated in a real-life pow-wow. Overall, the key word of the trip was “learn.” We spent a large portion of the week visiting a reservation school, so like many fellow participants, I thought I’d primarily be teaching. Instead, we were always learning.
Lesson number one from the Navajo reservation: the Navajo themselves didn’t come up with the name “Navajo.” The tribe was dubbed Navajo by the Spanish, but actually refer to themselves as the Dine.
In my opinion, the most relaxing and unique part of the trip was our visit to a traditional sweat lodge, where our host told us stories of Navajo culture. We learned that traditionally, a girl’s 13th birthday is marked by a three-day ceremony in which the girl must run alongside family members and later, massage them.
With my fourth grade students the very next day, I heard about this ceremony first hand, when a girl randomly brought up the ceremony and expressed her nervousness surrounding her 13th birthday, even though it was years away. Connections like these occurred throughout the week — we didn’t just learn about Navajo culture, or only witness it, but instead experienced a unique combination of both.
The dichotomy of culture shown by the fourth grade girl’s hesitancy towards her upcoming traditional celebration is demonstrated throughout the reservation; the specific focus of the trip is cultural erosion in native peoples. At the school, students danced to Skrillex before practicing traditional pow-wow dances, and transitioned from English to Navajo vocabulary lessons.
And we learned the Navajo culture right alongside them. We spent the night in a traditional hogan, a hut made of logs and mud. At more than one meal, we consumed fry bread, a Navajo staple comprised of flour, salt, baking soda and oil. We were even invited to a traditional sheep butchering ceremony, which I volunteered to attend even as a vegetarian (when in Rome, right?). Unfortunately, the ceremony was cancelled, saving you from a column titled “Confessions of a Vegetarian at a Sheep Butchering Ceremony.”
Usually, it may seem like this column encourages the reader to visit a specific place. In this case, you probably can’t immediately make the trek to the Navajo reservation, and if you’re interested in attending an Alternative Spring Break, you’ll have to wait until next year. So, I apologize that this week’s column lacks the opportunity for instant gratification. I’m not trying to persuade you into attending an ASB trip, but to rethink how you approach any trip — from a day adventure in the city to a cross-country road trip. What I learned from a week of “service learning” essentially boils down to this: experience places, don’t just visit them.

If you haven’t yet heard of chef-turned-rapper Action Bronson, stop reading this, look up “F-ck, That’s Delicious,” watch a few episodes and come back. The Queens, New York, native is the most inviting rapper in the industry, with a hearty mix of wit and humor that makes him feel just as much a friend as a rapper. His major label album debut, Mr. Wonderful, relays this light energy but keeps everything close to the chest with precise raps and beautiful instrumentals, culminating in one of the most unique rap albums of the year.
Bronson’s story is one of misfortune and rising from the ashes, as his true career intention was to be a chef. He had a successful career in cooking until breaking his leg in the kitchen, forcing him to the sidelines for months. While not cooking, Bronson, born Arian Arslani, began freestyling to pass the time, ultimately leading to his career in rap music. Since then he has become one of the fastest-rising stars in the industry, carving his path not only with his music, but with his cooking roots and persona. Bronson has quickly become an icon for bridging the gap between fine cooking and heavy rap music, most notably with his online show “F-ck, That’s Delicious.”
As a part of the Vice channel Munchies, “F-ck, That’s Delicious” brings together the rap scene and great dining, featuring Bronson eating with cooking legends like Mario Batali and allowing cameras behind the scenes at his shows. It is a raw look at his life and an incredibly humanizing series for the Albanian artist. Without releasing a ton of music, he has already attracted a huge fan base, so this album is long overdue.
The beats on Mr. Wonderful are part rock and part jazz, but rarely do they feel like hip-hop beats. It is a trademark of Bronson’s style that blends his work with prior generations and allows his raw lyricism to shine through. He is humorous — songs are paused to talk with his mother about her aching joints or ordering food at a restaurant — and talented, showcasing some incredible rapping chops through all his comedic interruptions.
Bronson is having fun, and his work makes it easy to feel that. Unlike most other rappers today, he rarely talks about money and almost never talks about guns or the ghetto, leaving him to craft his work around food, women and other parts of his life. This is why Mr. Wonderful is so great to listen to. Even the serious songs have an air of lightness, such as the track “Easy Rider.”
“I had dreams of f-ckin’ Keri Hilson in my Duncans / Woke up naked at the Hilton with a b-tch that look like Seal’s cousin.”
“‘Easy Rider’ is the culmination of my entire career up until now,” said Bronson in an episode of “F-ck, That’s Delicious,” signaling the importance of this song to him personally. Nonetheless, he raps about the unattractive woman he woke up next to one morning, or doing acid for a week in the mountains. This is Action Bronson, hell-bent on having a good time and unconcerned with rappers, critics or anyone trying to stifle his fun.
“Easy Rider” closes the album, which is fitting considering Bronson’s fondness of the track. Bronson described the track in an interview with Complex magazine.
“‘Easy Rider’ is one of the best things I’ve ever created in my life. It’s a beautiful song. The perfect end to everything that came prior. We end on a f-cking crack of the lightning and the thunder into a Curt Chambers guitar solo and we just ride the f-cking Harley into the sunset.”
The most well-known track off the album, “Baby Blue” features Chance the Rapper with Mark Ronson producing and is one of the only songs in which Bronson actually sings. Backed by a high-powered piano riff and heavy cymbals, this song manages to be both light and sad at the same time, with hilarious lyrics out of spite. Chance’s verse is simply a list of bad blessings towards a girl who seems to have hurt him.
“I hope there’s always snow in your driveway / I hope you never get off Fridays / And you work at Friday’s that’s always busy on Fridays,” Chance sings in a fashion that makes it easy to laugh at his misfortune. Adopting the lighter lifestyle of Action Bronson, Chance delivers a hilarious verse, and the whole track is accompanied by an equally funny video featuring Bronson as a hairdresser and Albanian band frontman.
Action Bronson is confident in himself, and his music reflects that with light content and intense delivery, all atop instrumentals reminiscent of an earlier era in music. Mr. Wonderful is one of the most entertaining albums I’ve ever heard, and though it is rough around the edges, it is a great listen.

France, arguably the fashion center of the world, is currently confronting a heavily weighted topic: the glamorization of too-thin women. The French Parliament is considering a piece of legislation that would set minimum weight standards for models, namely women and girls.
This legislation is part of a comprehensive health law currently being debated in the National Assembly. Supporters of the bill say that this new law is “necessary to combat the persistence of anorexia, from which 30,000 to 40,000 people in France suffer.” This proposed bill would use body mass index standards created by the World Health Organization to determine whether a model is healthy enough to work. Businesses that hire models whose weights fall below the healthy standard would be fined about $83,000 and could serve up to six months in prison, a tactic all countries should adopt.
According to the WHO, women with BMIs of less than 18.5 are considered underweight. A body mass index less than 18.5, however, does not necessarily mean that someone has an eating disorder; though many people are considered underweight by health professionals, they maintain a healthy balance of diet and exercise. The National Union of Modeling Agencies in France issued a statement saying it was following a voluntary charter that “discourages the use of anorexic models” that was approved by the government in 2008. A similar piece of legislation that is before Parliament today failed to pass in 2008 because of heavy criticism from the fashion industry, and thus the charter between the government and the NUMA was created. While the NUMA does not support the bill because it claims, “appropriate minimum weight standards for models had yet to be determined,” the organization fails to take into account the overall problem that most models are underweight. In fact, many in the fashion industry note that several of the top models today would likely weigh less than the WHO’s healthy BMI of 18.5.
France and other countries need to pass such crucial legislation and create standards for the media in terms of women’s appearance. While famous international designers such as Karl Lagerfeld deny working with anorexic models, just glancing through photos from Paris’ Fashion Week reveals frail-looking women with sunken cheeks and hollow body frames. Countries must follow the lead of such nations such as Israel, which passed a landmark bill in 2012 that requires models to produce a recent medical report at every shoot within the country demonstrating that they meet the WHO’s BMI standards. In Israel, this groundbreaking piece of legislation is a step in the right direction. Though the effectiveness of this bill is unknown, it was created to help lower the rate of anorexia in the overall population, which occurs in about 2 percent of girls between 14 and 18.
According to critics, legislation that tells models how much they need to weigh only focuses on weight and not the overall health of the individual, noting that some models are naturally thin. Weight, however, often has a direct correlation to health, and many medical complications arise from eating disorders. The government must address this issue of underweight models, as the fashion industry has failed to do anything to combat the issue besides promise to use healthy models, though this is rarely enforced. Nevertheless, the health of models is hardly a new topic, as the death in 2010 of a French model fueled calls for steps to address anorexia. The model and actress Isabelle Caro weighed just 55 pounds at one point in her career.
In addition, the bill in Israel included a clause that speaks not only to the weight of models, but to the way women are portrayed in advertisements as well. Israel’s legislation noted that advertisements “published for the Israeli market must have a clearly written notice disclosing if its models were made to look thinner by digital manipulation.” A quick Google search regarding recent Photoshop controversies within the United States produces an absurdly large amount of results. For example, huge companies such as Ralph Lauren, Target and Calvin Klein underwent public scrutiny when it was discovered that male and female models’ bodies were digitally altered to make them appear thinner. Supporters of the Israeli bill noted that “unrealistic body images in the media are believed to shape eating habits, especially among young people,” and the United States is unfortunately no stranger to eating disorders. In fact, according to the Renfrew Center Foundation for Eating Disorders, up to 4.2 percent of women in the U.S. have suffered from anorexia in their lifetime.
The body type portrayed in media that is perpetuated by underweight models and Photoshop, namely that of a thin, tall woman, is possessed naturally by only 5 percent of American females. But because of the use of unhealthy models and digital alterations, 69 [percent] of girls in 5th-12th grade reported that magazine pictures influenced their idea of a perfect body shape. Moreover, about half of all girls in 5th-12th grade reported that they wanted to lose weight to look more like the models in magazine pictures.
While the legislation in France and Israel only mention the ban on underweight female models to reduce the rate of anorexia and other eating disorders, men are also affected. In fact, an estimated 10 to 15 percent of people who suffer from anorexia are male, yet men are often left out of the discussion of the way the media impacts one’s identity. Overall, France and other countries must pass legislation that bans the use of unhealthy and underweight models, while also limiting the use of digital alteration in advertisements and the media, as these have vast negative affects on women and men.
sorry to burst your bubble but such a law in the US would without a doubt be a violation of the first amendment

On March 17, the United States Presbyterian Church ended the three-decade debate of same-sex marriage, but it leads to some confusion between the purpose of the government and the purpose of the church.
In 1863, Abraham Lincoln gave one of the most referenced speeches in history, the Gettysburg Address. In it, he claimed that the United States government was a  “[g]overnment of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.” Because America was founded upon the ideologies of democracy, the government caters to the needs of the people. The government is the police of freedom, making sure that the American citizen has the right and the power to freely live and love.
The church, on the other hand, is not an establishment based on democracy. The purpose of the church is to carry out the passages of the Bible. T.S. Eliot once said, “The True Church can never fail. For it is based upon a rock.” That rock is the Bible. Just as our free nation is based on democracy, the church is built upon the Bible.
The church and state have been separate for more than 100 years now, but as our society progresses forward, the church seems pressured to follow suit. Eighty-seven of the 171 regional presbyteries, local leadership bodies within the PCUSA, have voted “yes” to changing the definition of marriage in their constitution from “between a man and a woman” to “between two people, traditionally a man and a woman.” This change will take effect on June 21 in the Book of Order, which is part of their constitution.
This change leads the church in an entirely opposite direction from its beliefs. As the United States rests on democracy, the church rests on the Bible. Imagine America walking away from democracy, from the core values that have built this country. It would completely change the fundamentals of the country. And by declaring its support for marriage equality as more and more states legalize gay marriage, the church stops being the church and risks becoming another denomination of the government.
The Presbyterian Church is one of the largest presbyterian denominations in the nation, with about 1.8 million members. The church, however, has been declining in number as the more conservative congregations and individual members move to other denominations due to the Presbyterian Church’s shift toward liberal theologies over the past several years. In 2011, for example, the Presbyterians ratified the decision to ordain gays and lesbians as pastors, deacons and elders. The PCUSA has lost 37 percent of membership since 1992, and the vote to change the marriage definition could accelerate more departures.
The Rev. Brian D. Ellison, executive director of the Covenant Network of Presbyterians said, “Finally, the church in its constitutional documents fully recognizes that the love of gays and lesbian couples is worth celebrating in the faith community.” He continues, “There is still disagreement, and I don’t mean to minimize that, but I think we are learning that we can disagree and still be church together.” But the church cannot be something that is together if most of the conservative Presbyterians have left.
The church should be a place where differences could be set aside because, as the Bible commands, everyone is to be loved. The gays and lesbians should not have to be shunned away, and the church should not have to surrender its stance to accommodate them. It’s a gathering of those who wish to worship and a refuge to those who’ve soldiered through a difficult week. It’s not a place to fight against those who are different. The church and its members missed the central teaching of the Bible; they forgot the entire mission of being a believer: to love a person while never faltering in their own beliefs.
Paul Detterman, the national director of The Fellowship Community, a group of conservatives that have stayed in the church, explains, “Our objection to the passage of the marriage amendment is in no way, shape or form anti-gay. It is in no way intended as anything but concern that the church is capitulating to the culture and is misrepresenting the message of Scripture. We definitely will see another wave, a sizable wave, of conservative folks leaving [but] this conversation is dreadfully important to be a part of.”
Instead of changing the definition of marriage, the church must return to its foundation to plan the next steps toward a future of being the church that the Bible meant it to be. Instead of surrendering to society, the church might have to go back to the basics and rediscover the rock it’s been built upon.

Next week marks the deadline set last March by government officials to reach an agreement with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. With no framework set yet, it is difficult to imagine that an agreement will be reached between Iran and the West by the end of the month. With Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei looking at June as the hard deadline for a deal, it has become increasingly evident that Iran is kicking the can down the road. In terms of producing results for a deal, it seems as if Iran never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity, to echo the words of the late Israeli politician Abba Eban.
Despite a gloomy forecast, it is imperative for the P5+1, comprised of the United States, France, Britain, China, Germany and Russia, to reach a deal with Iran by this March deadline and avoid further sanctions. Though hard-line Republicans in Washington are pushing for stricter sanctions if no deal is met, continuing the same narrative of isolation and repudiation leads to poorer diplomatic communication and often stagnates negotiations further. Gunning for the completion of a deal now sends a stronger message than threatening sanctions, especially from one branch of government in one country involved in the round of negotiations. Delay tactics and political maneuvering, both domestically and internationally, seldom lead to positive outcomes, and reaching a deal by the agreed-upon deadline gives more credit and value to any such deal.
Even if a deal is reached next week, a broad agreement or understanding of what some on the Iranian side of the negotiating table want is not sufficient enough. A deal must consist of limiting the number of spinning centrifuges as well as limiting the design of certain reactors. Iran must also pledge not to pursue ambitions to build a nuclear weapon. The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is paramount to any deal cut between the parties.
Though the United States and its allies still hope for a grand bargain by next week, they would rather not walk away with nothing from the table. Striking a deal in June with certain agreements in hand by next week would at least be something the P5+1 can go home and show to their respective governments. Ayatollah Khamenei, however, has been adamant that there will only be one deal, and that deal is to be reached by June. The rhetoric employed conveys the sense that Iran is not serious about the negotiations and wishes only to cooperate on its own terms.
By permitting Iran to aim for a June deadline rather than next week, the P5+1 allows Iran to dictate the narrative and further delay any action. It’s like allowing your friend who still has your sweatshirt to keep waiting until the next time you hang out to return it. A deal requires concessions from both parties, and Iran’s conduct demonstrates that the nation is only willing to dance to the rhythm of its own drum. When the current round of negotiations began 18 months ago because of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s wish to boost his country’s economy, it was believed that Iran would finally sit down at the table with the willingness and sincerity to reach a deal. Instead, the picture that has been painted portrays a nation unwilling to concede any specifics of its nuclear capabilities and intent on delaying decisions until a later date. There is an opportunity now to reach a deal, and considering Iran’s track record, it will seize the opportunity to miss that opportunity.
The sweatshirt needs to be returned, and this time at the deadline agreed upon.

It’s pretty easy to forget that there’s life outside of Paris. Thankfully, our amazing staff at the ACCENT center wouldn’t let us forget so easily. Two weekends ago, they organized a trip for all the USC students to travel south of the bustling city of lights. One hop, skip and a TGV (this stands for Train à Grande Vitesse or, in other words, really fast train) ride later, we found ourselves in the ancient town of Avignon.
Unlike the bustling city of lights hundreds of miles north of it, Avignon is a quiet, picturesque town not too far from France’s southern coast. Walking around the unpaved, cobblestone streets of the city makes you feel like you’ve been teleported out of the real world and into one of your old Modern European History AP textbooks. And despite the plethora of shops and restaurants teeming with tourists, one can’t help but soak in the history of the surroundings. This proved especially true when faced with one of the largest medieval palaces in European history — the Palais de Papes, or the Papal Palace.
For those of you who are as rusty on your European history as I was, I’ll give you a quick run down: In the 14th century, Avignon became the Papal Palace after Pope Clement V decided to move the papacy from its traditional place in Rome to Avignon. Since then, Avignon’s palace housed seven Popes, including two anti-popes (the Church suffered a Papal Schism in 1378, during which period they had not one, but two Popes — but I digress).
Avignon wasn’t the only place our weekend travels took us. After visiting the Papal Palace, we continued south towards Aix-en-Provence, stopping at Pont du Gard, an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge built in the first century, and Château des Baux, a site of the remains of a 10th century castle.
Though traveling to all these historic sites certainly made me appreciate all the incredibly well-preserved history around me, it also reminded me that one doesn’t have to wander too far to see the history that lines all European cities. In fact, one would be pretty hard pressed to walk anywhere in Paris for too long without encountering some amazing part of history. In fact, I can see the Bastille, an important site in the history of the French Revolution of 1789, as I write this just outside my window.
Now that’s a view I could get used to.

Nowadays, mass open online courses (MOOCs) could just be the answer to the rising barriers of attending college. In 2012, it cost the average student $33,716 to attend a four-year institution, when barely 20 years ago, it would have cost the same student just $15,306.
MOOCs cater to those who cannot, or find it difficult to attend college, as they provide a low-cost investment into higher education. They are certainly much less expensive than attending a university, sometimes being offered for free and in addition, they are much more flexible than a traditional higher education course: you can take them at your own pace and when you have the free time. Certain demographics benefit in particular, such as full-time workers, single parent families and those in technical industries in which retraining is necessary after skills become outdated.
There has been a rapid shift towards providing MOOCs. Indeed, 22 of the 25 top leading universities in the U.S. offer some type of online courses. USC offers graduate school programs online and many undergraduate lectures, particularly in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics departments, routinely record their lectures and make them available online for students to access.
Unfortunately, MOOCs are not generally recognized as having the same prestige as attending a four-year institution. The general public sees the simple admission into a university as evidence of a student’s calibre, something which enrolment in an MOOC cannot recreate.
Indeed, there is no formal accreditation that is widely recognised by employers. It is this prestige that ensures that the demand for a four-year institution will never be overtaken by MOOCs. But the number of enrollers in MOOCs is definitely rising, and this growth is showing no signs of stopping.

The first day of spring just passed, but it doesn’t mean we have to box up our favorite recipes from seasons past.
During a trip to Ralph’s, I stumbled upon a package of pre-cut butternut squash which to me was very exciting because, firstly, butternut squash is extremely difficult to peel and cut, and secondly, one of my favorite soups is roasted butternut squash soup which is usually more in season during the fall. But just because it’s spring does not mean we cannot enjoy a bit of an earthy, delicious fall favorite.
For this recipe you will need:


First, chop all of your vegetables and apples (optional) and place them in a bowl. Toss them with olive oil and with a bit of the spices listed above. Spread them out onto a baking sheet and roast for about 35 to 40 minutes.


Heat up ghee or butter in a large pot on the stove. Combine the roasted ingredients in the pot with the chicken broth. Add the remainder of the seasonings, about 1 tsp of salt, chili powder and cinnamon.

Bring the ingredients to a boil and then reduce heat. Let simmer, covered for about 20 minutes.
Once simmered to perfection, you can either transfer the ingredients to a blender to puree them, or I found my roommate’s immersion blender to do a much quicker and efficient job — no extra mess or blender to clean up as well.

Reminisce a little about fall this spring day over a bowl of savory and creamy roasted butternut squash soup.

With registration fast approaching, you might be wondering what classes to take and how to craft a perfect schedule. If you’re a senior, odds are you’re going to have the freedom to take electives, and you most definitely should take advantage of the awesome classes USC has to offer. Here are five fun/popular/interesting classes you should consider if you have room in your schedule.
Professor: Leonard Maltin
Not only does legendary film critic Leonard Maltin teach this class, but also you get to watch a movie EVERY SINGLE WEEK. And more often than not, an interview with a director or a writer or an actor follows the screening. Shout out to Professor Maltin and his connections to the movie industry! The class meets once a week on Thursday nights for four hours.
Professor: Maura Godinez
With stellar RateMyProfessors reviews (an overall quality of 4.6 with many comments that say the class is arguably the best in the IR department), Professor Godinez brings her previous experience in the CIA to the classroom. Open, covert, clandestine and counterintelligence programs are some of the topics covered during the semester. Although the class is no walk in the park, students say that the effort put in translates into a rewarding experience that may even change your perspective.
Professor: Steven Lamy
Coming in a close second in the IR department is Lamy’s class. Highly regarded by former students, Professor Lamy is an incredibly passionate and knowledgeable professor that’s enthusiastic about what he’s teaching. Tip: visit him during office hours if you’re a little weary at first of his classroom environment.
Professor: Julia Sprague
You get to play volleyball in Santa Monica every Friday with the nicest instructor ever…I think that pretty much sells the class. Tip: sign up for the morning surfing class and the noon beach volleyball class to make your friends on the East Coast extremely jealous as you get to partake in the typical SoCal day…weekly.
Professor: Tanya Batura
I don’t know about you but I never got the chance to take a cool art class in high school, so I think ceramics would be super fun to take especially since Professor Batura boasts a 5.0 rating on RateMyProfessors (only 2 reviews but hey who’s counting?). This class also allows you to check out Roski, an area on campus that you have probably never been to unless you’ve gotten on acai bowl at Nekter, which definitely doesn’t count.

Alana Grayson | Daily Trojan
Prior to setting foot in Italy, I had a lot of expectations for what my experience here would entail despite trying hard not to. I’d occasionally get asked, “What made you decide to study abroad?” and my answer would always include a jumble of responses. After speaking to other students who have been spending their semesters abroad, I’ve gathered that some look at these programs as “vacations.” For others, it’s simply a break from the norm. Then you get the few who rationalize that living in a different country for several months presents the perfect opportunity to expand one’s horizons, and ultimately, grow as a person.
For me, it was a combination of all three and then some. There came a point in my college career that made me realize how vital it was that I begin to branch out from what I had grown so accustomed to my freshman and sophomore years. My efforts began with joining various organizations and teams that had sparked my interest as an incoming freshman, but never got around to participating in. As a result, I gained a multitude of unforgettable experiences, and met so many talented and sincere people at USC that I probably would never have gotten to know otherwise.
It was only fitting that my next step in my quest to sow my wild oats would be to leave the States entirely and seek adventure in foreign lands. I had always wanted to study abroad after hearing about all the fun my older sister had during her undergraduate studies in South Africa. A couple of years and some change later, here I am.
Being abroad has not only provided me with funny stories, culture, fun Instagram pictures, and a plethora of new foods — it’s challenged me to become a more independent, vibrant and courageous version of the person I was before leaving. I’ve found that sometimes, a breath of fresh air from any given situation or space can be just what you need to propel you towards where you need to be — or at least — where you need to be headed.
“Expand[ing] your horizons” doesn’t have to be limited to the physical place you happen to be in that moment, but rather what you make of your time there, and how you choose to spend it.
Italian Phrase of the Week: “Mangia bene, ridi spesso, ama molto.” meaning, “Eat well, laugh often, love much.”
Ciao, belli!
