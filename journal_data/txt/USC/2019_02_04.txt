Ben Rosenthal & Hailey Robertson & Julian Kuffour
Julian Kuffour, Ben Rosenthal and Hailey Robertson all have experience with Undergraduate Student Government’s legislative process. But their earliest training occurred on the USC debate team, a training ground of sorts for the aspiring USG senators. 
“We all have the skills of researching policy proposals, so we know how to write resolutions,” said Rosenthal, a sophomore majoring in business administration. 
Robertson, a sophomore majoring in global health, is currently the director of accessibility and affairs within USG’s advocacy branch, while Kuffour, a freshman majoring in pharmacology and drug development, is her delegate. He helps her brainstorm, research and present initiatives for accessibility. Rosenthal is the assistant director of USG’s Professional and Academic Fund. 
The three candidates aim to push for more student representation at the administrative level, improve mental health services and make resources available for sexual assault survivors.
Haley Garland & Sara Khoshniyati
For sophomores Haley Garland and Sara Khoshniyati, improving student healthcare is the most pressing issue USG senators face. 
“I wanted to be that health and wellness advocate for students because we go to such an amazing university,” said Khoshniyati, who is majoring in human biology. “[We are] very prestigious, but we need the resources to match the title.” 
Garland’s work as a USG senate aide and Khoshniyati’s experience as a director of programming for the Residential Housing Association have taught them skills they believe will translate to the Senate.
Both students hope to provide more safe spaces for sexual assault victims, counseling services at Engemann and increased online resources and information.
“[We want to work on] not only expanding our resources but also making people aware of the resources that we currently have,” said Garland, who is majoring in political science.
Garland and Khoshniyati are also campaigning for sustainability on campus and bettering student life, from expanding the number of water fountains to extending gym and library hours for students. 
Jacob Lind & Jacob Schwessinger
Political activism is a primary driver of Jacob Lind and Jacob Schwessinger’s senatorial campaign. If elected, the two candidates hope to foster a more inclusive living environment on campus for marginalized communities.
“The USC experience is very different for high-income kids, for men, for white people,” Schwessinger said. “It’s a very different experience for people who are not those social categories.”
Lind is a junior majoring in English literature and history, while Schwessinger is a junior majoring in political science and philosophy. Both students have been active on campus through Model United Nations and Trojans Advocates for Political Progress, which Lind co-founded.
“I started going to senate meetings over the last couple of years pretty regularly and speaking my mind during open forum,” Lind said. “I would really love the opportunity to be on the other side of that senate room, hopefully to set the agenda.”
Lind and Schwessinger want to improve trust between students and DPS, and reinstate leadership stipends — financial compensation for leaders in student organizations.
Angela Chuang & Emily Johnson
Angela Chuang and Emily Johnson first met as senate aides but quickly bonded over a mutual desire for a more unified student body. Now, they aim to promote initiatives on health and wellness, student assistance and academic resources at USC.
Johnson, a freshman majoring in business administration and French, said she wants to represent lower-income and first-generation students like herself, who may have difficulty adjusting to college life. 
Johnson described her first semester at USC as “stressful,” and hopes a summer bridge program would allow new students to experience college life before classes officially begin.
Chuang, a sophomore majoring in political science who transferred from George Washington University, said she wants to improve support for transfer students at USC, including expanding orientation to more than one day. 
She is keen to push forward mentorship programs and transparent resources for transfer students.
“I feel it’s important that transfers have a voice in Senate next year,” Chuang said. “And I want to be able to [get] that right for them.”
Gabriel Savage & Andrew Fowler & Randi Anderson
Andrew Fowler, Randi Anderson and Sen. Gabriel Savage are running for Senate as a slate. 
Savage, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, is an incumbent who hopes to become a leader for incoming senators. One of his goals is to remove the meal plan requirement for students living in USC-owned apartments.
Anderson, a sophomore majoring in choral music, wants to give students control over organization committees, extend communication between spring admits and school coordinators and implement a four-unit free audit system, which would give students the opportunity to take classes outside their major. 
“Being able to diversify what you’re learning and what you’re taking in and also the people that you meet would help you feel included,” Anderson said. 
Fowler, a freshman majoring in biophysics, previously served as Savage’s senate aide. In that role, Fowler examined senate legislation and was inspired to take part in the legislative process as a result. 
Fowler also hopes to implement a policy that will have EMTs stationed on the Row during weekends.
Emily Donahue & Christopher McMorran
As previous members of USG, Emily Donahue and Christopher McMorran are running for senate to expand their impact. 
McMorran, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, is the director of first-year affairs for USG. Donahue, a sophomore majoring in pharmacology and drug development, currently serves as USG’s parliamentarian, which she says has made her familiar with the legislative process.
During their time in USG, the duo has created an alumni and upperclassmen mentorship program, where students can receive support from experienced undergraduates and USC alumni on their academics and career prospects. In addition, they are currently negotiating a transfer forgiveness policy, giving incoming transfer students the chance to repeat courses where they received a grade of D+ or lower to remove the grade from their records.
The candidates advocate for transparency in USG, student representation on the Board of Trustees, town hall meetings for students and administration, a mentorship program for all students and expanded transportation on campus. 
Laura Pearson
Laura Pearson’s experience as a transfer student drove her to run for a seat on USG Senate, where she plans to improve campus sustainability efforts and help increase transfer-student engagement. 
Pearson, a sophomore majoring in philosophy and cognitive science, is also interested in politics. She wants to improve the University’s sustainability plan by adding concrete numerical goals and values for green efforts.
“If you look at the Sustainability 2020 plan, there were a lot of good goals set by the University to achieve by 2020, but they’re kind of vague,” Pearson said.
Pearson aims to increase transfer student involvement, particularly during Welcome Week, which she said is mostly geared toward first-year students. She is also campaigning for more housing accommodations for transfer students.
“Finding housing is really difficult when you’re a transfer student just because the acceptance starts in May, so by then [USC] Village is completely full, CarGar is full,” Pearson said.
As a low-income student, Pearson understands the need for more affordable programs and hopes to create a fund for students looking to join organizations with costly dues.
She also aims to increase the number of 24-hour study lounges or extend operating hours for campus libraries.
Quinn Cunniff
Quinn Cunniff’s straightforward mannerisms go hand in hand with his businesslike mindset. 
Cunniff, a sophomore majoring in accounting, seeks to make USG more profit-driven, starting with reforming its $2.3 million yearly budget and making all business transactions and budget usage public.
“I think you have to treat [USG] like a business,” Cunniff said. “You try to get as much bang for your buck … as possible.”
Cunniff also wants to improve the relationship between USG and “ostracized” populations, including transfer students and members of Greek organizations, by having USG work more closely with the Interfraternity Council.
Having lived in Texas, Australia, Michigan and now Los Angeles, Cunniff understands the importance of having a diverse population on campus and hopes that he can represent the student body.
Cunniff also believes USG is too centralized, since members leave major decisions to the Senate and Executive Branch. Instead, he wants to make the legislation process more “objective and streamlined.” 
Benjamin Shiff
Participating in Greek life and social events at USC motivated Benjamin Shiff, a sophomore majoring in communication and cinema and media studies, to run for USG Senate this year. 
Shiff’s platform is heavily focused on improving access to mental health resources by collaborating with groups across campus. 
He said he plans to train the leaders of student organizations, particularly in the Greek community, to talk to their members about mental health and sexual assault prevention.
“I think the most effective way to make the lesson about Title IX and sexual consent on campus accessible to people is by … making sure that our 1,000 student leaders are aware of all the rules,” Shiff said.
Shiff said he realizes that having supportive and safe clubs is an important part of the college experience. 
“I really want to use [school] organizations and bolster [comfortability],” Shiff said. “I want to use those organizations to impact this greater positive change at USC because [they] had such a positive change on my USC experience.”
Rose Ritch & Omar Garcia
Rose Ritch and Omar Garcia are running for USG Senate to change campus culture through inclusion initiatives and call for bureaucratic transparency. Ritch and Garcia hope to instill change on campus and ensure that minority groups’ voices are heard.
“I see myself as someone who’s very good at listening to the other side,” Ritch said. 
Ritch, a sophomore majoring in sociology and law, history and culture, has served as Vice President of Religious and Spiritual Life at USC Hillel and co-president of Trojans for Israel. Garcia, a sophomore majoring in business administration, is a resident assistant at New North Residential College.
Much of Ritch and Garcia’s platform focuses on increasing student access to mental health services. 
“We want to work with the Engemann [Student Health Center] to try to improve their mental health care,” Garcia said. “We want to make sure to add more therapists, add more sessions for them.”
Christopher Pack
Christopher Pack, a junior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, noticed a lack of basic necessities at the Viterbi School of Engineering, from water fountains to adequate mental health services. Pack said he wants to improve these aspects of daily life at USC.
“It’s always kind of felt that Viterbi is kind of left out from student government,” Pack said. “A lot of decision-making seems to be focused more on Marshall, because they’re very active, and political science majors in Dornsife.”
Pack’s platform focuses on improving safety for students by increasing transparency in the University administration.  
“I want the entire campus to have a lot more accountability, especially to students,” Pack said. 
Pack said he plans on making changes to the Engemann Student Health Center by adding a system where students can report professional misconduct.
Pack also wants to convince the school administration to give students the whole week of Thanksgiving off.

Michaela Murphy & Meagan Lane
“What’s the word for bromance for women?” USG Senator Meagan Lane asked. She paused, then suggested, “Womance … but that’s kind of gross.”
The only non-write-in candidates this election, Michaela Murphy and Lane view their relationship from this lens of affability. Having worked together as senators this semester, they hope to continue their legacies as president and vice president, respectively.
Murphy, a junior majoring in public policy, and Lane, a junior majoring in business administration, say their experience working as senators in USG has allowed them to build strong relationships with administrators.
“We have the most direct experience with understanding what it takes to actually make legislative changes, make administrative changes,” Lane said. 
In addition to their roles as senators, Murphy is the Director of Outreach for Trojan Advocates for Political Progress, and Lane is a member of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority.
If elected, they hope to expand many of the initiatives they worked on as senators, such as implementing full-cost coverage for STI/HIV screenings, advocating for student input on university decision-making and helping reinstate tuition remission for custodial staff and their children. 
Their platform also includes establishing a first-year mentorship program, expanding cultural centers and unionizing student workers, as well as accepting dining dollars in USC Village, creating fee waivers for transcript appeals and improving housing insecurity resources. 
Like many Senate candidates, they hope to increase access to health care on and off campus and develop sustainability by improving recycling and composting. 
Murphy and Lane are currently working on several projects as senators, from establishing an oversight board and allocations process for the USG Diversity Fund to hosting a shared governance symposium. 
“You can sum up our entire candidacy with this idea that we are not running on hopes and dreams, we are running on proof,” Murphy said. “We’ve done the work, we just want the opportunity to keep doing the work.”
Trenton Stone & Mahin Tahsin
Trenton Stone, a sophomore majoring in philosophy and cognitive science, and Mahin Tahsin, a junior majoring in business administration and economics, hope to transfer their experience as USG funding directors to the roles of president and vice president.
“One of the really cool perspectives of funding is that you’re in USG, but at the same time it’s one of the most externally facing roles,” Stone said. “You’re directly working with dozens of organizations every week to fund these applications, to meet with them, to learn about their events, to see how you can meet their needs financially.”
Stone and Tahsin are write-in candidates. They announced their campaign on Jan. 22, about a week after the first wave of candidates. When only one presidential ticket declared, Tahsin approached Stone and proposed the idea of running to provide a different choice to students.
If elected, they hope to continue advocating for civic engagement by funding different student organizations and initiatives, Stone said.
As the USG Director of the Professional & Academic Fund, Stone worked to improve awareness of funding resources offered to students.
“USG and USC can often seem like a roadblock or a big bureaucracy that people don’t know how to navigate or don’t even know is a resource,” Stone said. 
To better publicize resources, Stone and Tahsin propose creating a central system where students can type in any questions they have and receive a list of suitable resources and explanations, modeled after an existing virtual wellness assistant developed by the Office of Wellness. 
“One of the hurdles of being as large of a university as we are is there are a lot of resources, but it often feels very disjointed, spread out between offices, and you’re not sure how to navigate that space,” Stone said. 
Tahsin says the ticket wants to re-zone DPS officers, expand the hours of operation for the Disability Access to Road Transportation program, create an accessibility toolkit to help organizations plan events that are accessible to all students and ensure student representation in administrative decision-making.
Maxwell Brandon & Grayson Adler
As the only candidates without prior experience working in USG, juniors Maxwell Brandon and Grayson Adler view themselves as outsiders fighting for change.
“People in [USG] Senate run for president, people already involved in USG keep running to get in, and nothing seems to be changing,” Adler said. “It’s coming from the outside [that] really allows us to come from a student point of view.”
Adler and Brandon are write-in candidates who announced their candidacy on Jan. 24. As members of the USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, Brandon, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting, and Adler, a junior majoring in journalism, met at the campus speaker event that hosted conservative commentator Ben Shapiro last October. 
Both candidates have deep roots at USC — Brandon and Adler are  third- and second- generation Trojans, respectively — to which they credit their familiarity with USC’s culture. 
“Lately, I feel like things have kind of been tarnished,” Brandon said. “People have a lot of complaints with the school, and USC has such a great tradition of winning in all facets of the past.”
One such tradition they hope to revive is tailgating on Greek Row, which Brandon claims is “one of our main priorities.”
“We recognize the value of the traditions we have here at USC and when Greek life is threatened, we feel that USC tradition is threatened,” Brandon said.
Brandon and Adler want to create a Commuter and Transfer Student Lounge and improve orientation for spring admits and transfer students. Other campaign goals include promoting sustainability by transitioning to solar power and biofuels, increasing access to mental health resources and improving the quality of dining hall food.
Additionally, if elected, Brandon and Adler plan to donate their monthly salaries to a cause of students’ choice. 
Through these initiatives, they hope to help reignite students’ pride in their university. 
“There’s still a lot of great things about this school, but there’s this cloud now,” Brandon said. “We want to get that out of the way and make people proud again to call themselves a Trojan.”

In a turbulent fall semester, USC encountered continued fallout from revelations of sexual abuse by a campus gynecologist, new University leadership under an interim president and a rise in student activism over a controversial speaker on campus. 
But for Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee and Vice President Blake Ackerman, the past several months have also seen lasting positive change. Despite a semester riddled with conflicts, the two have been satisfied with their contribution to the growth of USG and its interactions with the University. 
“I think our biggest accomplishment in our term has been building bridges among so many campus partners,” Lee said. “It’s truly incredible to see how many people are eager to work with students. It’s just that they need some student input to guide direction.” 
During the 2018 campaign, Lee and Ackerman ran on improving campus safety and wellness. Under their guidance, USG has worked with the Engemann Student Health Center to provide student input on initiatives such as the expansion of mental health counselors on campus.
“I think we’ve cultivated at least 30 different kinds of relationships with various offices and departments across the University,” Lee said. “I’m very much looking forward to keeping those relationships in their fullest capacities and passing those on.”
During the past semester, USG worked with departments like Student Affairs and USC Civic Engagement. Lee is a current member of the President’s Culture Commission, a group of 13 faculty members and students created by Interim President Wanda Austin to address campus-wide issues and improve its culture. The commission is currently focusing on revising the University’s Code of Ethics. 
“While goals you can check off a list are really important, the best thing was that we really built relationships for years to come that people can rely on,” Ackerman said. “I think those relationships will go a lot longer and further than just the projects that we’ve completed here.”
This semester, USG has also collaborated with the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention, working with Associate Vice Provost Ilene Rosenstein and Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni to create OT 299, a one-unit occupational therapy course about healthy living. 
But USG also faced backlash for funding an event that brought conservative speaker Ben Shapiro to campus in October. While USG currently partially funds all student-run events, senators recently proposed a bylaw amendment to allow students to petition to reject USG funding in case of safety threats on campus, partially in response to the Shapiro event. 
The Senate also censured Ackerman in November after an anonymous email revealed comments he made that appeared to support hazing in his fraternity. However, the censure was later declared invalid and no official action or investigation against Ackerman was announced. 
Though Lee and Ackerman would not say whether there was anything in particular they would have changed about their response to these incidents, they explained that they had developed an optimistic mindset to counter obstacles in USG.
“I think a lot of this job requires you to remember what’s important and to cut off the noise that comes with it,” Lee said. 
The working relationship between Lee and Ackerman began far before they became USG president and vice president. The two attended Beverly Hills High School together, where they had also both served in the student government as president and vice president, each for one year.
“There have definitely been moments where we wanted to tear each other’s hair out,” Ackerman said. “But for every one of those moments, there are about a thousand moments where I want to just give her a huge hug and say thank you for being you.” 
For the remainder of their term, Lee and Ackerman are concentrating on following through on their remaining platform points. This includes engaging with USC’s  Symbols and Monuments Task Force, with the goal of renaming the Von KleinSmid Center due to the controversial history of Rufus B. von KleinSmid, the fifth president of USC who was an advocate for ethnic sterilization. 
The two are also working to create more rest and meditation spaces across the campus by communicating with Engemann and the Office of Health Promotion Strategy. Lee said she has also begun working with USC Transportation to advocate for greater parking options, as only full-day plans are currently available. 
“There are a few things that were a little bit stalled due to circumstances in the University and whatnot,” Lee said. “But I’m really looking forward to seeing how we can actually push for those things and get those done.”
