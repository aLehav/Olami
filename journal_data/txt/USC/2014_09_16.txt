In anticipation of the upcoming midterm elections, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times discussed the results of their latest public opinion poll project in a conference call on Monday.
The four topics assessed in this month’s poll included the California gubernatorial race, unaccompanied minors migrating to the United States, Proposition 46 and police discrimination in local communities.
Panelists speaking in the conference call included Dan Schnur, director of the USC Dornsife/L.A. Times Poll project and executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC; distinguished Unruh Institute fellow Michael Madrid; and Drew Lieberman and David Kanevsky from the polling firms Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research and American Viewpoint, respectively.
This month’s poll results revealed a high amount of political support for incumbent Gov. Jerry Brown (D) in his campaign for reelection against Republican candidate Neel Kashkari. When voters were asked which candidate was opposing Brown, many were unable to even identify Kashkari.
If the election were held today, Brown would defeat Kashkari 57 to 32 percent, according to a press release from Dornsife. The results showed that Brown has the support of 82 percent of Democrats and 18 percent of Republicans. Kashkari, meanwhile, has the support of 72 percent of Republicans and 10 percent of Democrats. Among voters who declined to state a party affiliation, 59 percent supported Brown, and 25 percent supported Kashkari.
Dornsife and the L.A. Times partnered in November 2009 to conduct statewide public opinion surveys, initially to cover electoral trends. Since then, the two institutions have expanded their research and have conducted more than 20 polls surveying registered California voters on a wide range of political, social and economic topics.
Kanevsky said that the wide range of issues up for a vote this year will allow voters to make more critical choices.
“Throughout the different topics we have on this survey — the water crisis, looking at the views on medical malpractice reform, immigration and police — I’d say there is a lot of nuance in the California electorate,” he said. “People think voters are uninformed, not thinking of the issues, just voting on partisan lines or ideological lines. You really don’t see that here. Voters are judging every issue on a different context and weighting the pros and cons for all of them.”
Issues concerning illegal immigration showed a divided electorate. Kanevsky said there was a split between voters who wanted to implement wide-ranging youth immigration reform, but opposed measures to raise taxes or contribute monetarily for legal aid.
“Comprehensive youth immigration reform still gets very broad support, 73 percent favor overall,” he said. “But, then you go and look at the unaccompanied minors questions that ask whether they should stay or be sent back and the opinions are much more divided, [48] percent in favor and 46 percent opposed.”
Lieberman emphasized that immigration was a topic of high importance to California voters.
“I think there is a current situation that underscores the level of concern that California voters have about illegal immigration,” he said. “A third of the voters here believe illegal immigration is a crisis — a crisis is a pretty high bar to cross.”
Other issues, such as police relations in the community and Proposition 46, have gained more attention recently among voters.
Proposition 46, a measure that would increase the caps on medical malpractice lawsuits and require drug testing of doctors, has lost significant support, according to the polling results. The first batch of data released from the polls revealed 62 percent of voters in support of the initiative. Later polling results, however, show only 39 percent of voters supporting the proposition.
Schnur said that the language of the proposed measure is misleading.
“They [the writers of Proposition 46] tried to cover up a very controversial policy measure with a very popular one,” Schnur said. “But a ballot initiative is only as strong as its weakest link, and the polling shows that voters’ concerns about medical malpractice are outweighing their eagerness for doctors to be drug tested.”
Meanwhile, 85 percent of Californians said that police had not treated them unfairly in the past year. The results follow nationwide controversy regarding use of police force this past summer after Michael Brown, a black teenager, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
In the same poll, however, two-thirds of respondents said they believed others had been mistreated by police.
“The good that the police and cops do, outweigh some of the bad a few members in the police force may do,” Kanevsky said.

USC’s fundraising campaign has raised $3.7 billion to date, putting the university within reach of its $6 billion goal by the end of 2018.
Halfway there · President C.L. Max Nikias speaks at the launch of a fundraising initiative in November 2012. USC has raised $3.7 billion to date. – Daily Trojan file photo
The campaign was the largest of its kind when it was launched in 2011 and is now second only to Harvard’s $6.5 billion initiative. According to the Council for Aid to Education, the campaign’s success thus far made USC one of the top three fundraising universities in 2013, behind Stanford and Harvard.
“[The project is] a combination of having very compelling visions for a strategic plan and confidence in the strength and enthusiasm of the Trojan family to help the university,” Scott Mory, associate senior vice president and campaign director, said.
Alumni have played a significant role in fueling the university’s philanthropic effort. According to Mory, approximately $2.2 billion of the funds raised come directly from USC parents and alumni.
Patrick Auerbach, associate senior vice president for alumni relations, said this prolific giving stems from the long-term relationships the university maintains with its alumni.
“The process of donor cultivation and stewardship is lengthy,” he said. “These relationships with the donors for the most part have been going on for a long time.”
One of the largest gifts in USC history came from Dana and David Dornsife, who in 2011 donated $200 million to the university. Back in 1986, Auerbach recalled, the Dornsifes made their first contribution of just $100.
“Every donation counts,” Auerbach said. “We want alumni to feel a sense of ownership, responsibility and accountability for USC.”
Mory is optimistic that the university will stay on track for a 2018 completion of the $6 billion goal.
“We’re sticking to our campaign plan led by President Nikias and we have a wonderful team of development professionals and volunteers who help us reach out across the Trojan family,” he said.
The endowment is expected to be split evenly, allocating $3 billion for student scholarships and faculty research programs and the remaining $3 billion to capital projects, infrastructure and academic priorities.
One visible effect of the campaign is the construction of The Village, a $650 million campus expansion to be located in the space formerly occupied by the old University Village. Donations have also funded the McKay Center and the recently opened Wallis Annenberg Hall.
“Students are already starting to realize the benefits that come from the campaign’s success,” Mory said.
USC, the state’s largest private university as well as its most internationally diverse, has benefitted from such large-scale philanthropic efforts. Not all students agree, however, on how the university’s considerable financial resources should be utilized.
Deepa Ramakrishnan, a freshman majoring in business administration, expressed concern about the community surrounding the campus.
“USC’s $6 billion campaign comes at a time during which the situation in South Central L.A. is still poor, and one would hope that a portion of this gargantuan fund is going towards community outreach, as no amount of privilege can separate us from them,” she said.
The university expects the campaign to enhance students’ own academic lives and the lives of future students.
“One of the campaign’s goals is to support current academic programs and current scholarships,” Mory said.
Anubhav Sarkar, a freshman majoring in computer science, said the depth of the endowment benefits USC’s academic reputation.
“[The endowment] shows that USC is really taking the next step to distinguish itself as a top-tier academic institution, and that it will be home to a new generation of the best scholars,” he said.

The Google Glass Journalism course taught through the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism held an open meet-up Tuesday night in Wallis Annenberg Hall during which Aneesh Chaganty, a USC alumnus and director of the Google Glass short film “Seeds,” spoke via G+ Hangout.
Through the Google glass · Professor of digital journalism Robert Hernandez said the diversity of students in the course creates an engaging learning community in which to utilize Google Glass technology. – Carol Kim | Daily Trojan 
Chaganty started out by sharing his perspective on Google Glass through his experience creating content using the device. “Seeds” is a short video of a man from San Francisco traveling to India to surprise his mother for Mother’s Day.
“For the first time ever, Glass allows a camera from the perspective of your eye without having something massive around your neck,” Chaganty said. “Glass allows great performances. Though people are really wary about it in the beginning, they get accustomed to it and seamlessly jump back into real life.”
After the presentation, each of the 11 students in the class pitched at least two ideas for Google Glass apps or features that could help advance the fields of journalism and media. Ideas included an app that gives the wearer contextualized information, such as relevant articles and data of wherever he or she goes, as well as an app that would allow journalists to annotate their interviews during long recording sessions.
“Chaganty mentioned how it was tricky to navigate through his content because he would get email or text notifications and his videos would be intermixed,” Vinnie Magro, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science, said. “So drawing from that, I think it would be helpful if an app could provide a better way to see what you want during content creation because you don’t want your videos to be mixed with other stuff.”
All attendees were allowed three votes to choose among the ideas pitched. From there, the class will make the final decision of what app to create throughout the course based on the feasibility of technological development and the implementation of Google Glass’ unique features.  Non-USC students also attended the event to learn more about the emerging technology of Google Glass.
“My friends and I have been playing with the technology of Google Glass for about five to six months, and we were interested to see the possibilities of this application in health care,” said alumnus Prince Nnah, Marshall alumnus ’08 and chief operation officer of San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital. “Currently, physicians have to leave their present location to do research on their computers, but imagine if they could pull up the newest treatment options or recent articles instantaneously. Or if patients ask questions of things they are not aware of, to have access to information right at your fingertips would be very useful.”
Creator of the Glass Journalism class Professor Robert Hernandez  hopes to continue incorporating Google Glass in the classroom, and plans to offer a course called Developing on Emerging Technologies.
“For me, the core value and goal of this class is bringing the diverse skill sets of this campus together and having these passionate and creative students not just read a textbook and talk about making something, but actually building something and engaging with the community,” Hernandez said. “People focus on Google Glass, but the part I’m most excited about is the class’ student diversity — we have a gender balance, domestic and international students, undergraduate and graduate students that are so diverse on many levels, yet the chemistry is just fantastic when they are working together.”

Like the titular bad houseguest in the film, The Guest is a flick that greets the viewer with an exciting bang, shows immense promise and then makes the whole encounter awkward by drinking too much, vomiting on the shag carpet and passing out facedown on the kitchen linoleum.
In a small town in rural New Mexico, the Peterson family is left reeling from the death of their son, Caleb, who was a soldier fighting in the Middle East. David (Dan Stevens) is a veteran who takes it upon himself to arrive unannounced to deliver Caleb’s last words of love to his family. The Petersons are an ordinary and stereotypical bunch that almost seem modeled after characters in the board game Life. Caleb’s mom, Mrs. Peterson (Sheila Kelley), is one-sided for the entire film, and Mr. Peterson (Leland Orser) drinks too much and hates his boss. In other words, they have as many dimensions as a piece of paper.
Caleb’s little brother Luke (Brendan Meyer) and sister Anna (Maika Monroe) are more dynamic characters and brilliantly portrayed. Luke is bullied at school, and Anna is a goth high school senior who hates her boyfriend. David, the unexpected visitor, fits in with the family and is inexplicably invited to stay a few days. He breaks up Anna’s strange relationship and helps Luke deal with his demons at school. Meyer and Monroe, a professional kite-boarder turned actress, deliver moment after moment of hilarious exchanges that will surely keep at least half the audience from leaving the theater mid-film. But as a series of strange events begin to rock the small town the Petersons live in, even the talent of the two cannot salvage the movie from becoming a train wreck.
For whatever reason, a huge number of low-budget Sundance thrillers follow this same predictable trend: In the beginning a few talented actors manage to build a rather intriguing plot that suddenly, and without warning, comes crashing down in a burning mess of unexplained plot twists and egregiously overdone concluding scenes. The film is described on its website as blending the “finely tuned tension of a psychological thriller and over-the-top visceral excitement of an action drama with the sly humor of a subtle satire and the pulse-pounding suspense of a classic horror film.”
It blends those genres about as deftly as a one-flippered walrus blends drinks at a bar. The film was certainly thrilling, horrifying and exciting. But it was also just bad.
In a preposterous bloodbath reminiscent of the Game of Thrones Red Wedding scene (and apparently in an effort to cause the audience to forget how little sense the plot makes), everything about the movie seems to fall apart, leaving only the pain of watching it still standing. Hilariously simplistic and cheesy lines combine with quite possibly the worst “chase-through-the-high-school-prom’s-haunted-house” scene in all of cinematic history to produce a miserable experience not worth the price of admission.
But, just like how an intoxicated night is sometimes worth waking up on the kitchen floor, a certain moviegoers will appreciate the film’s excessive attempts to thrill and horrify. A particular viewership (call them the movie adrenaline junkie type) will also appreciate the film for its eclectic and cerebral selection of ’80s electronic music, which lends the film a uniquely cool and “things are not as they seem” vibe that follows the characters throughout the film. Film critic Richard Roeper urged moviegoers not to be surprised if the film becomes a “cult classic” — and he may very well be right. The modern day throwback to ’80s horror is certainly primed for a cult following from a very specific type of viewer.
Roeper was only half-right, however, when he described the movie as “completely ridiculous and entertaining as hell.”
Like a football player tackled on the two-yard line, The Guest simply falls short. Given the many questions and complex messages about family and loss that fronted in the film’s beginning, it is unsurprising that the movie fails to answer them all satisfactorily. Put simply, the film is a victim of its own success as the dynamite premise simply ends up biting off more than it can chew.
The Guest opens in select theaters on Sept. 17. Like any good guest, it should sample some appetizers, shake some hands and leave promptly.
92% of movie critics on RT seem to disagree with you.

USC’s newest a cappella group, the Trogons, are bringing Chinese pop music to campus in fresh new ways. As a part of East Asian Languages and Culture department, the Trogons strive to give the opportunity to international and Asian-American students to express themselves and explore the culture of East Asia through music.

Formed in spring 2013 by Andrew Liu, Sharon Hu, Gary Wu, Kaiti Liu and Ekkawat Sae-Jee, the Trogons were inspired by USC’s South Asian a cappella group Asli Baat to create a singing group for East Asian students. The group was named by mixing the words “dragon” and “Trojan” to form “Trogon,” as a symbol of their heritage and their collegiate pride. Their repertoire includes Mandarin, Cantonese and Taiwanese pop songs, as well as mashups of Chinese and English songs that appeal to non-Chinese speakers as well.
The group has already made a splash in USC’s a cappella community as a part of All Hail A Capella earlier this year. The Trogons hosted their auditions with the other groups on campus.
“Our president, Andrew Liu, has also been working closely with Troy Tones on acapella traditions in welcoming newbies,” said Anna Wong, director of internal affairs for the Trogons. “In general, we really feel welcomed in this community and we look forward to many more collaborations and performances in the future.”
In the spirit of collaboration, the Trogons have also performed with UCLA’s Mandarin music a capella group, TAU.
Trogon members are a diverse group of mostly international Asian students. Most members have had some music experience in either singing or instrumental performance, but very few are music majors or minors. The group is open to singers of all backgrounds who love to perform East Asian pop songs and share the passion they have for the culture and music.
The audition process takes into account the social dynamic of the group as well. In addition to singing, sight reading and blending auditions, potential new members have a social mixer to see how they fit into the group. Trogons are not only looking for new voices but also new friends and can be found bonding over group jam sessions and karaoke in their free time.
The technical vocal aspect of the audition is competitive — after preliminary auditions only a third of singers go on to callbacks and fewer will make it into the group. The Trogons, however, are open to all students and welcome any performer who is passionate about East Asian music and wants to be a part of this fast-growing group of singers. They provide family, community and cultural pride and expression that is especially important to international students as well as Asian American singers.
Beyond just performing, members of the Trogons also serve as ambassadors for music in the East Asian community of USC. They work closely with partner organizations, including the International Student Assembly, Chinese Students Association, Hong Kong Students’ Association, Taiwanese Student Association, Chinese American Student Association, Chinese Students and Scholars Association, Taiwanese American Organization. The Trogons are asked to perform at events including the iVoice singing competition hosted by ISA in which two Trogon members also served as judges.
“We really believe that we represent the passion for music of the East Asian Community,” Wong said.
Through last year the Trogons were focused on kickstarting the group and making a name for themselves, this year they are expanding through their new social media effort. In addition to performances on campus, the group is set to release several music videos and other YouTube content. Their second annual spring concert will take place in 2015.
“As most of our members are international students with an asian background, I felt that our connection is much stronger than singers in other groups. It is more than music to us, it is also about where we come from and the music we grew up liking. Wong said, “That is what makes us special.”

After the huge success of sushi restaurant chainlet Sugarfish, owner and chef Kazunori Nozawa has created a faster and cheaper sushi restaurant  in downtown Los Angeles. The concept is a counter-only sushi bar that specializes in hand rolls such as the famous and beloved Blue Crab Hand Roll that is served as the final plate in Sugarfish’s prix fixe  meals.

The relatively small Main Street location features a large, square-shaped bar in the center of the restaurant with a limited amount of outdoor patio seating for takeout orders. The atmosphere has a vibrant and youthful energy in the evenings and draws together a cool mix of Downtown hipsters, business people and young couples. There is a line of people at the front of the restaurant waiting for chairs to become available at the self-seated bar. Once seated, the proximity to other diners mixed with great lighting provides a family-style feeling within the chic sushi bar.
Everything in the bar is designed with style and functionality in mind. Chairs are equipped with hooks for purses, and all silverware is disposable but still sleek and presentable. The action on the other side of the bar is pleasantly relaxed. The discourse between managers, sushi chefs and diners is calm, and the service is as timely and professional as one would expect at Sugarfish.
The kitchen offers three set menus with three to five hand rolls and prices ranging from $10.50 to $17.50. It also features several à la carte options and a rotating sashimi option. The waiters, who are wonderful when dealing with substitutions, are also educated about the sushi and willing to answer questions.
The sushi overall is extremely high quality and flavorful. The fish has the same fresh taste that Sugarfish is known for and attention to detail is paid to ensure a great bite. Highlights include the toro hand roll, which creates a wonderful balance of fat with the slight acidity of the rice. The halibut sashimi was also a surprise with its floral and citrus aroma, which was a nice complement to the fish. Even the unassuming cucumber hand roll brought an incredible amount of flavor and depth in its simplicity.
The restaurant’s to-go menu includes two 16-piece cut roll options and an eight-piece cut roll with sashimi, which make perfect lunches when in a rush coming from work or for a quick dinner on the run before an art show or concert in Downtown. A cut roll à la carte menu is also offered.

Though KazuNori is a fantastic spot for casual date nights or quick work lunches, the small space and limited seating are not great for parties of more than three. Trying to seat more than two diners at the bar can take half an hour or more due to the limited space. The restaurant also has policies about not switching an already seated group’s position as it disrupts the intricate flow that allows the staff to move sushi so quickly. As the location gains buzz, it is hard to say if the short lines and quick turnover will continue. The ease of dinner without the wait will most likely end. But that kind of quality with their low prices it is well worth the wait for diners looking for delicious and affordable sushi.
KazuNori’s location on Main Street is also outstanding. The restaurant is situated near a decent amount of street parking and two $10 lots. The building is also relatively close to the Expo Metro line, making transportation from USC quick and easy with or without a car. This part of Main Street is always bustling with well-dressed young people running off to one of the many art galleries nearby or the poetry lounge down the street. The sushi spot is also right next to two works of street art.
Overall, the experience of eating at KazuNori is enjoyable and convenient, and the price for sushi this well-made is unbeatable. Gone are the days of students craving Sugarfish but not having the money to spend on it. KazuNori provides all of the amazing freshness, service and ambiance of Sugarfish without the price tag or the wait. KazuNori is sure to be a hot spot for USC students and other STET DTLA residents alike.
Kazunori is located at 421 S. Main St. The restaurant is open from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 12 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays, and from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays.

This past weekend, USC’s women’s volleyball team held the annual USC Classic tournament at the Galen Center, and it did not have the results that it was looking for. With a 6-0 record heading into the tournament, the Women of Troy dropped both their matches against Texas A&M and the 10th-ranked Florida Gators.
Back at it · Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu’s injury kept her out for three games, but she has averaged 3.0 kills per set since returning. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
The 10th-ranked Women of Troy (6-2) hope to have more success in their upcoming tournament, the Pac-12/Big Ten Showcase.
Against Texas A&M, the Women of Troy had their hands full with the Aggies’ strong middle blocker play and tenacious defense. USC had a two-to-one set lead going into the fourth, but Texas A&M took over. In the last two sets, the Aggies held USC under a .150 hitting percentage, which allowed them to take the decisive fifth set 16-14.
It didn’t get any easier for the Women of Troy, when they faced Florida. Florida swept USC three sets to zero but every set was decided by three points or less. In the third set alone, there were six lead changes and 13 tied scores.
During practice this week, head coach Mick Haley emphasized passing as well as getting sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu more repetitions, since she has only been back for roughly a week.
Senior setter Hayley Crone spoke about this week’s practice, stressing the importance of improvement for each player as well as the team.
“We are working really hard in practice before we leave,” Crone said. “We have been working on our individual skills as well as everyone working on being smarter.”
Going into the third week of the season, the Women of Troy find themselves on the road once again in the Pac-12/Big Ten Showcase up in Seattle. This tournament features Maryland, Washington and last year’s national runner-up, Wisconsin.
Haley seemed daunted by the Women of Troy’s schedule.
“It doesn’t feel like such a good thing right now and we’d like to have them fighting through it every day,” Haley said. “Our conference is tough, everyone is 8-1 or 7-2, and it’s going to be a dog fight.”
Aside from an extremely tough schedule, Haley continued to emphasize that his team is very young and still learning how to play with one another.
Haley played middle blocker Jordan Dunn, outside hitter Brittany Abercrombie and outside hitter Lauryn Gillis, all of whom are freshmen, on the court together at the USC Classic at one point.
“It doesn’t feel like you are playing with freshmen,” Abercrombie said. “[Dunn and Gillis] are both so mature volleyball-wise.”
This young USC team’s first test of the tournament will be on Thursday night against No. 4 Wisconsin, who has continued to improve since last year’s success, starting the season 8-0.
Wisconsin returns most of its starters, including All-American honorable mention Ellen Chapman. Chapman, a 6-foot-4 outside hitter, will cause a lot of pressure on the defense. Abercrombie will have the task of slowing down Chapman up at the net.
The Badgers utilize a balanced offensive attack to win their matches, with five players averaging more than two kills per set. Chapman leads those with 3.56 kills per set. Wisconsin middle blocker Dominique Thompson, meanwhile, leads the team with 1.04 blocks per set.
In the second game of the upcoming tournament on Friday, Sept. 19, the Women of Troy will take on the Maryland Terrapins, who have a 7-2 overall record.
Most of the seven wins that the Terps have accumulated were against subpar opponents, and the two losses came at the hands of Radford and Appalachian State. Outside hitter Adreené Elliott leads Maryland with 3.93 kills per set.
This weekend will be crucial for USC to get back on track and find a team rhythm before Pac-12 play begins.

When I watched Boston College quarterback Tyler Murphy essentially seal the victory against USC this past weekend with his 66-yard touchdown run to cap off 191 yards individually and 452 yards rushing as a team, the feeling I had was somewhere between disappointment and genuine adoration. It was painful and beautiful at the same time.
Run it · Freshman dual-threat quarterback Jalen Greene has been lauded for his ability to escape the pocket and run, a trait not normally associated with USC quarterbacks. Greene will likely redshirt this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
I promise I don’t have any loyalty to BC, but I will admit that I have a total soft spot for a good read-option.
I could write an entire column on the decision-making by USC’s offense, but fellow Daily Trojan columnist Jake Davidson covered that topic pretty well Monday. I agree that Coach Steve Sarkisian could have called more pass plays in hindsight, but the real issue is depth at both lines.
Instead, I want to focus on the decision-making by BC’s offense, specifically that of Murphy, and the beauty that is a well-run read-option.
It’s a relatively simple, yet genius strategy. Instead of having quarterbacks simply hand the ball off to tailbacks on designated running plays, give the quarterback the option to hand it off or run the ball himself. After the snap, the QB will quickly read whether certain defenders have committed to stopping a run towards the middle by the tailback or containing a run to the outside by the signal caller.
It only works if the offensive line forces defenses to make a decision by preventing defensive lines from getting too much penetration, and if a quarterback has the wheels to keep defenders honest and can make smart reads when the defense is forced into a decision.
It worked on Saturday.
As mentioned, Murphy rushed for 191 yards, but he also read and handed off another 261 yards worth of rushing. On top of that, BC didn’t lose possession because of any difficulty or miscommunication on a hand-off.
It makes me wonder why USC is still somewhat stuck in the old days when it comes to overall offensive philosophy rather than individual play calling. I love the up-tempo game, but I want to see USC quarterbacks leave the pocket more. Maybe that’s because I find athletic quarterbacks more fun to watch, but I think there’s also an undisputable advantage for an offense if its quarterback can run.
Mobile quarterbacks have seemingly haunted Trojan defenses since Vince Young’s play in the 2005 National Champion game, and yet USC has stuck with guys under center who fit the description of a pocket passer. Several NFL teams like the Carolina Panthers, Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins have all consistently utilized the read-option in the last couple of years. If Pete Carroll can use it while leading a pro team to a Super Bowl Championship, maybe it’s about time for the Trojans to try it. Oregon essentially invented the spread offense, and the innovative unit that consistently leads the country in yards and points per game uses the read-option all the time. And if you’ve ever played Madden 2004, you have a firm appreciation for how a speedy Michael Vick can turn an otherwise below-average Atlanta Falcons team into the most unstoppable force known to mankind.
So my request to Coach Sark isn’t to take the reins off of redshirt junior starting quarterback Cody Kessler; it’s to take the reins off of freshman QB Jalen Greene.
Greene looks pretty set to redshirt this season, but he’s easily the fastest and most likely to change a game with his feet of all the Trojan gunslingers. Running the ball more may seem absurd given the 20 yards rushing USC had against BC, and calling more pass plays probably takes some of the strain off the thin offensive line. But as New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick said to SB Nation, utilizing a mobile quarterback in the run game is like having an extra guy on the field, and forcing just one defender to watch perimeter runs can open up a huge hole up the middle. If Sarkisian can save Greene as an ace up the sleeve for a crucial postseason game this year, I would love nothing more than seeing him run a wildcat formation, or anything really, for a couple of plays.
Speaking of postseason games this year, there’s a bigger reason why I’m not as bitter and frustrated over this loss as I have been over prior USC upsets: It’s really not that significant. There’s a chance Florida State, Oklahoma and two SEC teams take the four playoff spots regardless, but I would be very surprised if the winner of the Pac-12 was not in the playoff.
Of course, to get there, USC would likely have to make it through conference play unscathed then stop that aforementioned offensive machine of Oregon in the Pac-12 title game, and the Ducks would put up 70 points against the USC defense we saw Saturday. But you don’t need a reminder that anything can happen after Saturday, and USC is still undefeated in conference play.
The loss reminded me of the 2008 team’s defeat at Oregon State. I vividly remember posting a derogatory comment about Beavers’ running back Jacquizz Rodgers 5-foot-6 stature on my AOL Instant Messenger away message — I was in eighth grade and hadn’t joined Facebook yet — after he rushed for 186 yards and two touchdowns. I knew USC’s national championship hopes had ended by the third game of the season because the second chance provided by a playoff didn’t exist, even though the Trojans were arguably the best team in the country.
The results haven’t changed. The Trojans seem to have a fluke loss every season, but I feel like I get better at embracing and coping with the absurdity each time. The change in the playoff format certainly helps, but a change in our quarterback and run game philosophy would help even more.

The Trojans returned to practice on Tuesday for the first time since their 37-31 loss to unranked Boston College on Saturday. The coaches and players were seeking solace and growth after suffering such a stunning upset.
Came up short · Junior wide receiver and co-captain Nelson Agholor tied a career high with nine catches in Saturday’s loss against Boston College, but only ended up with 64 receiving yards and one touchdown. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
D.J. Morgan Gone
Redshirt senior defensive back D.J. Morgan has decided to “retire from football” to focus on track, in which he also competes for USC, before entering the NFL Draft.
“I recruited D.J. out of high school, and he was an elite track athlete, and he wants to get healthy for that opportunity, and so we wish him the best of luck,” USC head coach Steve Sarkisian told the RipsIt blog.
Morgan is the second running back-turned-defensive back to leave the team this year, following Anthony Brown’s tumultuous departure.
Morgan finishes his career with the Trojan football team with 364 rush yards and one touchdown along with one receiving touchdown.
He had not started a game since his redshirt freshman season in 2011 due to numerous knee and ankle injuries.
Not Just a Bye Week
The bye week could not have come at a better time for the Trojans.
Following a loss to unranked Boston College, the Trojans dropped from their top-ten ranking to No. 17 in the Associated Press poll. At Tuesday’s practice, the focus was no longer on Boston College but instead on improving, both individually and as a team.
The taste of defeat is something that can often distract a team from moving forward, but the team seems to have moved beyond that.
“Some people hold that taste longer than others,” junior wide receiver and team captain Nelson Agholor said. “I had that taste in my mouth and I spit it out, and I’m back to being hungry to get better.”
To get the bitter taste out of the Trojans’ mouths, Sarkisian ran a more fun practice. Instead of scouting, there was a lot of competition.
“It was a practice that was tough, and it showed character,” Agholor said. “You have to make this a habit you can’t get rid of: having fun and practicing at a high level.”
Though Sarkisian was happy to conduct a relaxed practice, he remains committed to improving his team.
“The bye week is about getting better,” Sarkisian said. “For some guys, it’s getting better physically. For other guys, it’s getting better mentally, getting their minds right, and for other guys it’s about getting better at their craft on the field.”
Post-Game Reflection
Though the team’s new focus is recovery and preparation, the Boston College game will be viewed as a learning experience for each player.
“They were the better team that night,” redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler said. “Any time a team plays USC, they are going to bring their A-game and that means that we are going to have to bring ours too.”
The team also faced criticism for their continued struggles running the ball. Despite this, Kessler showed support for the game plan.
“You always have to establish a run game, and we had a lot of missed assignments when we were trying to establish our run game,” Kessler said.
Agholor, however, did not think the wide out group was without fault.
“We should have done a better job of making [the plays],” he said. “We got some of them, but we didn’t get all of them.”
Injury Report
Junior wide receiver Christian Tober broke his collarbone during last Thursday’s practice. He underwent surgery and the time frame for his return has not yet been determined.
Freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith did not practice Tuesday. He was resting his ankle, which he injured during Saturday’s game.
Junior defensive end Leonard Williams, redshirt junior tailback Tre Madden and senior tight end Randall Telfer all sat out Tuesday’s practice as well, citing extended rehab.

Last month, the Los Angeles Unified School District changed its policy to handle minor offenses — such as fighting and possession of alcohol or small amounts of marijuana — with counseling rather than ticketing or other legal actions.
The original ticket policy was enacted to create accountability for students, as schools needed a way to control unruly behavior. Ticketing kept schools safe for students by removing repeat offenders from the classroom. In addition, students who caused fights or carried illegal substances were immediately punished for their actions. In theory, this punishment would discipline the student and prevent further misbehavior.
Though this decision is controversial, it should become the standard for school districts across the country. Students with just one arrest on their record are twice as likely to drop out of school. A majority of colleges now look at criminal records as a part of their admission process, so for students who do finish high school, university prospects with an arrest history can be bleak.
For security reasons, the decision to handle offenses with counseling includes the provision that police will be involved if a victim has an injury requiring paramedic attention, according to the LAUSD website. This exception balances protecting students from unfair penalties while protecting students from battery or other harm.
Preventive intervention is an alternative to current LAUSD programming. At-risk youth would receive programming as early as first grade to prevent fights, drug use and other criminal behaviors. A 2010 study in the Journal of Experimental Criminology found that students who underwent preventive intervention had a lower probability of juvenile arrest.
Difficult long-term habits can detract from the education of a student and his or her peers. Arresting or ticketing students is not the only way — or the best, for that matter — to prevent long-term issues, however. Preventive intervention, followed by intensive counseling for problematic behavior, keeps the most students in the classroom and outside of juvenile detention facilities.
Even if LAUSD does not adopt preventive measures, the study gives hope that counseling can be an effective measure to reduce troubling behavior.
It is not feasible for school districts to completely eliminate ticketing and arrests from their disciplinary policies, but they should at least enact a three-strike policy and only involve the police in drastic cases. A three-strike policy would protect students from repeat offenders at their schools. It would also give the offenders a second chance.
No school should be allowed to involve the police for a first-time incident regarding a minor offense. Twenty percent of student arrests are the result of fights, according to the Los Angeles Times. Disputes between teens should be solved through counseling, not the criminal justice system. Fighting in school should be minimized, but one altercation should not put students’ futures in jeopardy. According to the Department of Education, a single high school dropout costs taxpayers over $500,000 on average in loss of tax revenues and social services and incarceration costs.
The policy change will also help curb the disproportionate number of arrests of black students. Though black students make up 10 percent of LAUSD, they are involved in 31 percent of these student arrests, according to the L.A. Times. The move towards counseling and away from arrests will level the playing field.
This change will hopefully show that ticketing is not the only way to teach students accountability. Counseling programs are designed to force students to take responsibility for their actions and devise punishments that do not alter a student’s future prematurely for the worse. Teens belong in class, not in juvenile detention centers. Los Angeles made a step in the right direction. Hopefully, the rest of the nation’s school districts will soon follow.

Over the last few years, social media has become a place for many to share opinions quickly, publicly and — in many cases — without immediate consequences. Apps such as Yik Yak, however, have taken things further by allowing users to post messages anonymously, a move that opens the door to hateful rumors, bullying and other types of internet harassment.
Elizabeth Cutbirth | Daily Trojan
 
Co-founded by Furman University graduates Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington in 2013, Yik Yak has become active on approximately 250 campuses. According to Business Insider, 2,000 people signed up within the first day of the app’s launch at one  university. This is no surprise. Yik Yak, an app aimed at college students, allows users to share any thought with anyone linked within the same approximate area. According to ABC News, Droll said that the app was originally intended to resemble “a city’s central plaza or campus bulletin board.” This bulletin board, however, in a little more than half a year, turned into a space that facilitates cyberbullying and rumors.
At USC, Yik Yak’s popularity and prevalence within the student body has spawned all types of issues associated with social networking. One example is the rumor floating around this month of sexual assault at USC’s Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Though the details of the rumored attack haven’t been released to the public, what little written evidence there is comes from comments and stories posted on Yik Yak. What makes Yik Yak dangerous in such situations is that it creates an atmosphere that facilitates the spread of rumors — whether they are true or not. In the case of this possible fraternity scandal, the most disturbing comments range from “No means yes and yes means anal said lambda #butactuallyf-ckrape” to “I’m by Lambda. Might as well lube up.” The frivolity of both messages mocks the traumatic pain and horror that victims of sexual assault experience. This case demonstrates horrific misuse of a powerful communication tool.
Though these comments were terrible, other posts still remind us of the possible good that social media can bring about in a community. “No matter what happened, it doesn’t make the way people responded to even a possible rape any less disturbing,” one user wrote. Whether he or she had been responding to the statements made earlier on Yik Yak or just the entire scandal in general, the individual seemed to understand the gravity of the situation by acknowledging that such jokes are crude. Clearly, Yik Yak does offer the chance for people to come out and spread positive messages, showing that it could potentially have great uses. In this situation, though, the negative outweighs the positive.
Several factors could explain why anyone would think it appropriate to make heinous comments about such a serious incident. First, there is the lack of compassion and empathy in people when they can hide behind a screen. According to Collective Evolution writer Jeff Roberts, “For the most part, people don’t speak to one another in public as they do online, instead there is usually a mutual respect for someone else’s opinion and equal reciprocation within a conversation or debate.” The lack of face-to-face interaction makes it easier for people to leave respect out of the picture. The element of anonymity just makes things worse because it not only enables, but also protects those who want to start rumors or harass others.
In fact, on the app, cyberbullying is evident every day. From just this week’s posts in the USC area, someone wrote, “The real question is: do freshmen have sex with their lanyards on?” Such a comment singles out and pokes fun at a class of students who should feel welcomed by the rest of the Trojan Family. Since no one is held responsible for anything said, these types of messages can be posted for all to see.
It is imperative that people begin to censor themselves and realize that posts — especially when anonymous — can have devastating consequences. Without careful evaluation, the idea of anonymity has the power to destroy the productivity of internet tools, such as Yik Yak, that have potential to do good.
