A season that opened with a top 10 national ranking for USC men’s basketball, with talks of a potential Final Four berth, ended Monday night in the second round of the National Invitational Tournament.

In a contest that came down to the final seconds, USC fell to visiting Western Kentucky in front of a Southern California home crowd at the Galen Center, 79-75.
A basket from WKU senior forward Justin Johnson gave the Hilltoppers a 76-73 lead with one minute remaining in regulation. 
USC sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic’s late basket cut the WKU lead to 76-75 with 53 seconds to play.
A free throw from Johnson, who finished with a game-high 23 points (8-for-14 FG), put the Hilltoppers ahead 77-75 with 33 seconds remaining. 
On the ensuing USC possession, freshman forward Jordan Usher airballed the potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 24 seconds left in play. 
The Hilltoppers proceeded to put the nail in USC’s coffin with a dunk from WKU graduate student forward Dwight Coleby with 11 seconds remaining. Coleby’s late slam put the Trojans behind, 79-75. 
“It was a weird kind of game for our team, having so many players missing on our team,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “Western Kentucky played very, very well tonight. But we’re focused on all that we did accomplish this season.” 
For the second consecutive game, USC was without its leading scorer, junior forward Chimezie Metu (15.7 PPG this season). Metu, who was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team this season, has elected to sit out of NIT games to avoid injury before the upcoming NBA Draft. 
Despite not playing, Metu was in the general audience at the Galen Center, seated behind the USC bench. 
“After speaking with administration and looking at policies, [it wouldn’t have been] possible for Metu to sit on the bench with the team as an inactive player,” Enfield said. “It was his decision [not to play in NIT]. And we respect him as a student-athlete. He’s given our program three fantastic seasons.”
USC’s biggest struggles Monday night may have came from the charity stripe, as the Trojans finished the game shooting 8-for-19 (42.1 percent) from the free-throw line. In completely opposite fashion, WKU hit 16 of its 17 free throw attempts (94.1 percent) against the Trojans. 
“Yeah, we were terrible [at the free-throw line tonight] … that made a big difference in the game,” Enfield said. 
It was a pair of free throws from WKU graduate student guard Darius Thompson that gave the Hilltoppers a 74-72 lead they would not relinquish with just over two minutes remaining in regulation. 
After a layup from senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, USC led by 6 points with just under six minutes remaining,  67-61. McLaughlin concluded his illustrious USC career by recording a double-double Monday night; as he scored 13 points (6-for-13 FG) and collected 14 assists. 
Rakocevic also recorded a double-double against the Hilltoppers. Despite being left out of the starting lineup, Rakocevic gave the Trojans an 11-point (5-for-7 FG), 10-rebound effort off the bench. 
USC senior guard Elijah Stewart also put together a strong performance in what was his final game as a Trojan. Stewart, who concludes his USC career with the most 3-point field goals in USC history, finished Monday’s game with a team-high 20 points (8-for-13 FG). 
Stewart hit a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the third quarter to cut the Trojans’ then-deficit to 59-58 entering the final quarter of play. His last game with USC saw him hit 4-of-7 shots from beyond the arc. 
A 12-3 run from WKU in the third quarter gave the Hilltoppers their largest lead of the game at 57-50.
The Trojans trailed the Hilltoppers at the halftime break, 40-39. A three-minute scoring drought in the second quarter from USC gave way to a 9-0 WKU run that gave the Hilltoppers a 38-35 lead with two minutes left in the half. 
Stewart was tied for the game-high in scoring at the half with 12 points (5-for-9 FG). Stewart scored 10 points in the first quarter. 
“It’s the end of a chapter in [some of our] lives … we’re going to miss it,” said Stewart after his final game as a Trojan. “We gave USC the best four years of our lives, and now it’s time to go be grown ups.”
Western Kentucky shot a combined 17-for-28 (60.7 percent) from the field in the first half. 
With the loss, USC finished the 2017-18 season with a 24-12 record overall (12-6 in  Pac-12 play). This season was USC’s third-consecutive with 20-plus victories. Over the past three seasons, USC has won a combined 71 games (the most in a three-year stretch in program history). 
The Trojans’ second-place finish in the Pac-12 regular season standings was the highest conference finish in program history since 2002. 
Over the offseason, the Trojans will deal with several key losses in their personnel. The losses will include vital seniors such as McLaughlin and Stewart, and almost certainly Metu. A young core and returning contributors for USC will look to keep the momentum of this program going forward in a positive direction. 
“Well now, it’s the job of the next group of guys to step up and keep the winning going for our program,” Enfield said. “I can’t say enough about the upperclassmen we’ve had on our team. They came to USC when our program was rebuilding, and they have been the reason our program has [had so much success] the past three years.”

The USC baseball team improved its record to 11-5 after a series win against Utah at home over the weekend. The Trojans took two out of three games against the Utes, coming off a 3-2 win at Dodger Stadium over No. 17 UCLA.

The Trojans won the first and third games of the series against Utah, and USC’s improvement on the mound this season was evident in their victories. The team threw a combined no-hitter in the first game, led by 7.2 stellar innings from freshman starter Kyle Hurt.
“I just felt really good out there,” Hurt told USC Athletics. “I didn’t really know I had the no-hitter going until the fifth inning. After I finally realized I was just going into the dugout, taking deep breaths and trying to keep myself composed.”
The sophomore tandem of relievers Austin Manning and closer Connor Lunn finished the job, bailing out an offense that mustered just two runs on nine hits. 
“It was huge to have [Manning] and [Lunn] finish that off,” Hurt told USC Athletics. “[Manning] did a great job getting a quick out in the eighth and then of course [Lunn] picked up his sixth save of the year. It was pretty fun.”
Lunn continued to excel in his sixth save of the young season and Hurt earned his second win in 2018.
“[Hurt] really set the tone tonight,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “Giving up no hits into the eighth inning is an incredible feat … I was just proud of how our guys stuck with it time after time. The story of the night is really Kyle throwing 7.2 no-hit inning and what a great job the pitching and defense did.”
But the Trojan bats faltered again in a 4-0 loss the next day, as the lineup couldn’t get anything going against Utes senior starter Tanner Thomas. The Men of Troy managed only two hits, both in the second inning, and wasted a nice performance from junior reliever Solomon Bates — who gave up one hit and struck out six batters in 3.1 innings of work.
USC’s hitters would spring to life in Game 3, however. In the second inning, redshirt junior infielder Stephen Dubb hit a double to right center, driving in 2 runs. In the seventh, after a sacrifice fly from sophomore pinch hitter Brady Shockey made it a 3-run game, outfielder Matthew Acosta hit a 2-run home run to make the score 5-0.
“I thought the guys responded well after getting shut out yesterday and came out ready to play,” Hubbs told USC Athletics. “I was proud of them for that.”
The Utes scored 2 runs in the ninth, but the outcome was never truly in doubt. Junior pitcher Quentin Longrie picked up the win after tossing seven shutout innings.
“We definitely wanted to take care of business this weekend,” junior shortstop Chase Bushor told the Pac-12 Network. “Tough loss last night, but it was good to see the team rally together and come out and get a good win today.”
The Trojans will play a road game Tuesday against UC Irvine, which stands at 10-8 after dropping the final two games of their last series with Utah Valley. Irvine is headlined by senior first baseman Ryan Fitzpatrick, who leads the team with a .350 batting average and 14 RBIs. USC’s pitching staff will have to deal with him carefully.
Early in the season, the Trojans have established themselves as one of the premier fielding teams in the nation, ranking first in college baseball in fielding percentage at .993 and errors with just four in 16 games. These are the stats of a polished team, a far cry from the youthful struggles of the 2017 season, and they make the Trojans much harder to defeat when the team doesn’t beat itself with poor performances. If USC can continue this success in the field, they could earn a few extra wins in a competitive Pac-12.
As for possible areas of improvement, redshirt junior third baseman Angelo Armenta and junior outfielder Lars Nootbaar have struggled early in 2018. Armenta is hitting just .191 with three RBIs so far this season. Nootbaar, expected to be the Trojans’ leading hitter coming into the season, hasn’t been much better with a .208 batting average and three RBIs. As two of the more experienced players on the team, USC will need these two to pick it up if the team is to reach its full potential.
After they take on the Anteaters, the Trojans begin a three-game road series against No. 3 Stanford on Friday.

Over the weekend, the No. 12 USC women’s lacrosse team enjoyed its third consecutive win against Oregon State at McAlister Field on Sunday. After a hard-fought battle, USC was left on top by a score of 9-8.

The Women of Troy continued their winning streak by overcoming Oregon in overtime. The game-winning goal was netted by sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller, who drew a foul in overtime and led the team to a victorious win. Miller has proven to be a strong asset for the Women of Troy, scoring 20 points so far in the 2018 season.
In the first five minutes of the game against the Ducks, the Trojans put 3 points on the scoreboard. This was an ambitious start for USC, which had a strong first-half performance against Oregon last year as well.   
Oregon put up a solid fight. The Ducks scored 3 goals in 61 seconds during the first half, 2 of those goals from free position. With 17 minutes on the clock in the second half, neither team could find the back of the net until Oregon’s Shannon Williams tied the score at 7.
USC sophomore attacker Hope Anhut scored with seven minutes left on the clock. Her efforts put USC on top with little time remaining. Nonetheless, Oregon’s senior defender Jill Zubillaga scored for the Ducks, tying the score with just eight seconds left on the clock, forcing the game into overtime.
The game would remain knotted in overtime until Miller netted the game-winning goal with a mere 51 seconds on the clock.
The victorious win advanced the women’s lacrosse team to 33-9 all-time at McAlister Field. The overtime win against Oregon marked the first time that USC has ever played in back-to-back overtime games.    
Senior goalie Gussie Johns, who has previously received the Pac-12 Player of the Week honor, had eight saves, six ground balls and caused three turnovers against the Ducks. Johns has had a total of 66 saves this season.
The women’s lacrosse team emphasized the importance of continuing to work on their defense and communication on the field during practice. The team has attributed its success to improving not only as a team but also as individual players.
“Our goal during every practice is to keep improving and working on our own personal goals,” Johns said. “We want to fix things from past games and continue to move forward as a team.”
Up next, the women’s lacrosse team will defend their winning streak against Cal this Friday. The Golden Bears have recently fallen to Oregon and Colorado, both of which are teams that USC has defeated 9-8 and 8-7, respectively.
The game against Cal, whom USC beat last year 21-4, will conclude the first half of the Pac-12 season for the Trojans.

Regardless of your feelings on the whole NBA vs. NCAA basketball debate, there’s no denying it — March is the best time of the year for any fan of the game. The sheer quantity of games, combined with weird tip-off times (hello to the only time of year when you can wake up, make breakfast and catch an excellent 9 a.m. Division I game), completely inexplicable upsets and last-minute buzzer-beaters, build up March Madness into perhaps the most fun three-week period of the year.
This year has been unlike any other. The whole nation seemed to stop for a few hours as No. 16 UMBC absolutely destroyed No. 1 Virginia last weekend, becoming the first 16th seed to do so in NCAA history. The following weeks were filled with upsets, as top ranked teams fell left and right to unsuspecting underdogs. Leonard Hamilton, the head coach of the Florida State team that knocked off Xavier, the other No. 1 seed to fall before the Sweet Sixteen, said it best: “It’s almost like a revolution.” 
This revolution isn’t really a revolt of any kind. Rather, it’s a reflection of the growing parity of men’s college basketball. As the game has continued to grow, with the NBA and NCAA basketball alike amassing a greater crowd of fans every year, the young players who pick it up are becoming better and better. 
Decades ago, it would be shocking to hear of a No. 1 seed getting knocked off before the Final Four. Now, it’s likely that the Final Four could see a set of teams all ranked lower than No. 1 and No. 2. That balance of talent between the top and bottom seeds is giving small teams hope and dynasty programs a reason to panic, and it’s beautiful to watch.
The same parity, however, doesn’t exist in the women’s game. With women’s basketball, there’s nothing all that mad about March — at least not about the ending. For the past decade, the sport has been dominated by the University of Connecticut, which kicked off this year’s tourney with a 140-52 victory over St. Francis Pennsylvania. By half time, the Huskies had almost scored 100 points. 
To be fair, it was pretty entertaining to watch a team score that many points in a single outing, and the first half was a decently good game of basketball to watch (after all, St. Francis did its best to keep pace by putting up 31 points). But by the fourth quarter, in which the Red Flash put up only 4 points, the quality of the game had flown out the window. Any blowout of that degree is painful to watch, no matter one’s fandom. 
The University of Connecticut isn’t to blame for this phenomenon. Head coach Geno Auriemma is an incredible leader, and he has trained some of the finest athletes in the game, including Maya Moore and Sue Bird. His success has been built over a 33-season career, in which the team has grown into an internationally recognized powerhouse.
And it’s not as if his Huskies are invincible. Last year, the team’s tourney run was stopped short in the Final Four. But it’s been years since the Huskies didn’t make it to a Final Four. In men’s basketball, dynasties are built but remain very destructible, like that of Virginia. In the women’s game, that simply isn’t the case.
I’m not going to join the small group of haters who argue that UConn is bad for basketball. That simply isn’t the case. Auriemma is the best in the business, and his team wins because he has poured his heart and soul into the program he has built. There’s a reason that Auriemma was also the head coach of the U.S. national team, and a reason that half of that roster is filled with players from his college squad. The Huskies often represent the best that the sport has to offer.
But the lack of parity in the women’s game is reflective of the growth that still must occur in women’s basketball as a whole. I truly believe that parity occurs when a sport becomes better. As more players start their training at an earlier level, and have a wider range of great athletes to look up to and records to chase, a greater number of teams develop to a high level of talent and performance. This is why the men’s game is continuing to improve from year to year, and why this year’s March has been such a fireworks show.
As the women’s game continues to grow, we’ll hopefully see the same parity develop. This could take decades — after all, it’s been almost 80 years since the NCAA men’s tournament was officially started, and only now are we beginning to see this balance among the teams. But the development of that balance between teams — there is so much talent that a handful of programs simply can’t catch them all — will be a strong sign that the women’s game is finally developed to the same degree as the men’s.
One day, we might see the dynasty of UConn women’s basketball upset in the first down by some no-name squad. It’ll be an exciting moment when that day comes.

It seems that no one can get through a year, or even a week, of college without at least one YouTube binge. Those sessions that start with a video sent from a friend or linked in an article that turn into strings of “up-next” and “recommended” clicks, leading you far afield from the video you started with. You finally resurface, hours later, your brain feeling like a bloated sponge, wondering how you got from an innocuous Buzzfeed clip to “Why Illuminati Replaced Nicki Minaj with Cardi B – THE TRUTH.”

The answer is YouTube’s recommendation system, a closely-guarded algorithm that queues up videos based on user history and machine learning. The algorithm is designed to keep the viewer watching video and creating ad revenue for the site, and is remarkably effective. It exploits the human desire for novelty and entertainment, recommending and autoplaying videos infinitely until the user chooses to stop. To keep us watching, the algorithm tends toward extremity in all things, from $1,000 makeup hauls and all-fruit diets to the more dangerous realms of conspiracy theory, dubious science and fake news.
In this arena, YouTube poses a danger far greater than a few wasted hours. After the Las Vegas mass shooting in October, the algorithm was found to be promoting conspiracy theories calling the shooting a hoax. Just a few weeks ago, a video alleging the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting was a product of “crisis actors” shot up in views through the recommendation algorithm, landing on the coveted “trending” page of the site due to an extreme spike in its popularity. Videos that peddle obviously false, conspiracy-minded news narratives seem to be favored by the algorithm, and if someone is exposed to enough of these ideas over time, their view of reality can be considerably distorted.
Further, it seems that there is a bias in the algorithm toward right-wing and far-right content. Former YouTube engineer Guillaume Chaslot conducted a statistical analysis of the algorithm right before the 2016 presidential election by seeding accounts with pro-Hillary Clinton and pro-Donald Trump searches. A combined 86 percent of recommended videos contained damaging messages about Clinton, regardless of the seeded search. This does not mean that a right wing bias is written into the code of the site, but that over years of aggregated user data, videos with a right-wing viewpoints have garnered precedence over their liberal counterparts, so the algorithm tends to recommend them when all other variables are kept consistent.
Leaders of alt-right and white supremacist groups have taken full advantage of this fact, and YouTube is crawling with right-wing pundits who can act as a gateway drug to the vitriolic and racist world of the alt-right for vulnerable young people. Transcripts of conversations in alt-right chat rooms even show members coordinating to make thousands of fake accounts and downvote videos with more leftist viewpoints, further gaming the algorithm in their favor. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Southern Poverty Law Center representative Ryan Lenz said that “the alt-right is incredibly adept at navigating and otherwise exploiting loopholes in social media platforms.”
As college students develop and refine their opinions, it is important to acknowledge the power of platforms like YouTube. In these companies’ missions to maximize ad revenue, they can lead users down dangerous paths of radicalization, recommending content that is increasingly extreme and driving viewers on both sides of the political spectrum even deeper into their ideological echo chambers.
So far, YouTube’s responses to these controversies has been inconsistent and ineffective, using a few human moderators and demonetization to remove only a few of the most offensive channels. Still, the artificial intelligence of the site brought a conspiracy video about Parkland to the trending page as recently as last month. There may be something deeply wrong with this algorithm, but since it is still incredibly effective at retaining user engagement, YouTube seems reluctant to make any substantive changes.
In a world where the average American adult spends ten hours per day consuming media, platforms like YouTube can be just as impactful on college students’ worldviews as any professor or class. But at the end of the day, they are businesses that traffic in our attention, not educational institutions. It is important to push for improvement at YouTube (and its parent company, Google), but consumers also must develop their skills of moderation and critical thinking in their media consumption, as difficult as that can be.

I got the idea to start the petition and resolution to change the name of the Von KleinSmid Center for International Relations, named after former USC President and known eugenicist Rufus B. Von KleinSmid, a couple of weeks ago at night while I stood on top of my fire escape off Magnolia Avenue. I remember that night distinctly.
 It was the night I heard my friend had been murdered.
I looked at the cold pavement below. I could jump. Is this truly the only option for me? Is this the final fate of those who rage at the knowledge of their own powerlessness? At the tragic, inexplicable absurdity of the human experience that has systemized a cruel unequal world that we cannot change?   
This episode was spurred by the murder of Richard, a friend of mine who lost his life to gun violence.  We grew up together on the South Side of Chicago — a place with a vibrant culture, but a place marked by racist housing and redlining policies that forced people of color into ghettos and underfunded public schools. This created a cycle of poverty, disenfranchisement and violence. 
His death sparked a new idea of how I saw the world, a vision that was both frightening and simplistic. That maybe black men, or better yet, people of color, might forever be chained to the nightmare of violence and tragedy. That ideals of equality are often but a cruel farce. That no matter how brave our efforts, white supremacy and its legacy makes us subservient. This bitter truth made me coil further into tragic, hopeless rage. I barely shaved and isolated myself in my room. I felt trapped, like chickens in a chicken coop, living my life while white supremacy held the ax.
That feeling of helplessness to power is not something new to me or those in a similar predicament on campus. That feeling is age-old, passed down through generations. My great grandfather was a person victimized by powers greater than his own. He was a plumber in the segregated South. Segregation did not allow him to pursue education, therefore this was an occupation into which he was forced. He was called every derogatory name in the book. 
But one incident in particular showed his grit. My grandfather saw my great grandfather on his knees trying to fix a clogged toilet for one man, and the man got his head and shoved it in the toilet, laughing at him and my grandfather. But my great grandfather did not become visibly angry. Instead, he buried it deep inside. Just like in the modern day, the LGBTQ community, women, people of color and other victims of discrimination have to bury feelings of anger because if they rebelled against a society so determined to deny their humanity they would be stereotyped only further. Cruel fate had sealed him in an inescapable loop of humiliation with lacking opportunities. His life would be a prison, a hell he would never escape from. 
In my conversations surrounding VKC with students on this campus, I felt the same deep seething anguish that I imagine consumed my great grandfather. Those not deemed human by VKC would have to endure the humiliation of going to class every day in a building named after him and honored by him. We have had to endure the degradation that our lives and feelings are not as important as this historic statue; of this powerful ghost, and maybe never will be. 
When the petition to change the name of VKC went live, death threats began pouring into my inboxes. The hardest part of the whole ordeal was telling my mother I might not make it to spring break.
But my mother told me not to pay them any mind, and actually told me a story about my great grandfather. She did not describe him as a defeated man, living in a hole like the protagonist of Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man. No, I was wrong. Actually, he was a dreamer. He would work double shifts so that my grandfather would be able to afford college. My grandfather would rise up in higher education, and defy all odds to become a professor here at USC. Just a generation ago, this would have been unimaginable. It was my great grandfather who dared to dream, a man not imprisoned by his circumstances, but rather, a man who never gave up, a man who had hope. 
This hope is not particular to my grandfather, or any one person. It is something I believe is a part of the DNA of all Americans. Just as legacies of discrimination were passed down to too many of us, so was hope. It was the hope in the face of enormous power that forced a small band of patriots to defeat the mighty British empire. It was hope that inspired our army to storm the beaches of D-Day in the face of certain death. It was hope that got women marching in the streets demanding the right to vote. It was hope that led Martin Luther King Jr. to the Lincoln Memorial and inspired a nation to dream of the impossible. It was hope that got me off that fire escape and fighting for this resolution. It was hope that we could dare to challenge the all-powerful conventions of the world and make the impossible possible. 
I understand that the chances of change happening soon are distant, and maybe this will never change. But our human history gives us all the reason in the world to hope that it can. To believe in our abilities to change the world. While Tuesday’s vote in the USG Senate to change the name of VKC might be symbolic, don’t doubt the power of  symbols. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech and patriots in Philadelphia writing our Constitution were once just words and symbols. Words and symbols that would go on to transform the world.

Since last fall, Facebook, Twitter and Google have faced intense scrutiny and pressure after reports of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, primarily through the Kremlin’s use of these online platforms to divide and exploit American voters. 
And with this weekend’s revelation into Facebook’s massive data release ahead of the election that put over 50 million user profiles into the hands of political data firm Cambridge Analytica, government leaders and citizens alike are finally recognizing Facebook’s irresponsibility and unresponsiveness to the information it gathers as well as its impact in the political sphere. 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is currently under fire from U.S. and European leaders, who are seeking an explanation as to how Cambridge Analytica acquired users’ personal information to craft political messages for its candidates.
But time and time again, the company constantly diverts responsibility, either to users or third-party groups engaging on the platform. When Facebook was accused of allowing the spread of fake news, it attempted to fix its news feed set-up by curating more personal posts and limiting content from companies and brands.
This time, Facebook has offered another excuse. In an official Facebook blog post, Vice President Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” 
The New York Times reported Cambridge Analytica had worked with a Cambridge University psychology professor to create an app that would gather user data on Facebook. Facebook claims that “people knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked” through Cambridge Analytica’s data retrieval method.
Although Facebook has said this was not a technical data breach, the ethical questions around the company allowing such activity to occur under its watch remain unanswered. The users who “knowingly” submitted their information through the app were not aware of the purpose behind this data collection, nor did they realize the extent to which their information would be analyzed for political gain.
A New York Times opinion piece called Facebook a “surveillance machine” based on the vast amount of data it collects and consequently sells to advertisers. It’s important to remember that Facebook is not just a technology company: It’s a data-driven goldmine, one that harvests and holds on to the data of 2 billion people. 
Facebook has constantly tried to hide behind the facade of a social platform, but its revenue stream reveals otherwise. According to Adweek, Facebook’s biggest revenue channel is advertising. 
With the advent of social media, advertisers have shifted gears on engagement strategies, working with social platforms and influencers to reach users. Political campaigns and firms have also caught on. And throughout this shift, Facebook has reaped the benefit of having over two billion users worldwide — a massive amount of personal data and browsing history that can be attained and exploited despite the company’s claims that it is closely monitoring the platform.
If we take a look back at Facebook’s recent history, we can see multiple instances of its irresponsibility with users’ personal information. In 2011, the company settled with the Federal Trade Commission for failing to keep various privacy promises to users, such as allowing third-party apps to access user data beyond what was needed to operate. 
A 2016 ProPublica investigation revealed how Facebook allows advertisers to exclude users by race. Although Facebook responded with further efforts to fix its advertising portal, ProPublica found in 2017 that advertisers were still able to target ads excluding users by religion, family status, national origin, sex, race and more. 
These are just a few of examples, and the revelations of Cambridge Analytica’s shady data retrieval will be another one in the books for Facebook, which has only offered marginal policy changes to address the flaws of its platform.
The scope and access of a large online platform to individuals’ personal information must now be recognized by policymakers and citizens to ensure the creation of an online environment where personal data is carefully monitored and protected to prevent misuse from advertisers and political interest groups.
If Facebook continually fails to craft viable technological solutions to protect user information, policymakers need to take action to hold these companies accountable for their loopholes that put personal data at risk.

Moving between interviews and showcases at a furious pace, Nilüfer Yanya’s first SXSW experience is the product of hard work rather than late-night parties and panels throughout downtown Austin. The London-based indie-R&B sensation handles the rush of each day with the graceful wit of an old pro, while still eagerly welcoming all the week has to offer. Outside a café on Brazos Street, Yanya spoke candidly about her musical past and the exciting future ahead, as well as her first trip to SXSW.
The London-based artist enjoys traveling, songwriting and sharing her art with others. “The week has been busy, but great so far,” Yanya said. “It’s been a nice glimpse into Austin and SXSW. You have to embrace the non-stoppedness of it all.”
Signing to ATO Records, releasing two EPs and now playing her first headlining North American shows all within the past year, continual motion seems to be a recurring theme within Yanya’s life. She looks upon her accomplishments with fondness, saying she never imagined these dreams would come to fruition.
“The journey has been quite surreal. Before the summer, I had never been to America,” Yanya said. “I had never thought about an American label, or even doing so much as a show in America. When you come here, it becomes an actual place. So much has happened in such a short space of time, it feels momentous. These things happen for a reason.”
While she hasn’t had the opportunity to explore America just yet, Yanya has done her fair share of traveling. Using creative pursuits for good, she and her sister Molly started Artists in Transit, a collaborative arts project geared toward delivering creative workshops in underdeveloped communities in 2016. Since then, the collective has taken three trips to Athens, Greece, sharing their skills and love for art with the children of the community.
“Artists in Transit is our way of showing solidarity in the way we know we can,” Yanya said. “I just came back the other week from Athens. I’ve grown to love it – I feel like I’ve really gotten to know the place.” 
Yanya performed her first headlining shows in America this past November in New York and Los Angeles, and has already come a long way since those milestones. Her February  EP “Do You Like Pain?” received critical acclaim, with songs like “Baby Luv” and “Thanks 4 Nothing” exhibiting the wide breadth of Yanya’s songwriting capabilities. Released in conjunction with remixes of both songs, one of which was done by Yanya’s friend and saxophone player, Jazzi Bobbi, the EP has received attention from publications including DIY Magazine and Pitchfork.
“‘Baby Luv’ and ‘Thanks 4 Nothing’ allowed me to get more expression into the music,” she said. “It wasn’t so much about creating an interesting part, it was about being able to simplify something and use it in different ways. Each time I write a song, I never know what it’s truly about until afterwards, and it may take on an entirely new meaning much later. I feel like I’m writing the same song again and again — just trying to write it better each time.”
On the lineup for highly anticipated SXSW showcases such as SoundCloud, BBC Radio 6 Music and KCRW, Yanya is relishing in the week’s festivities, but is equally enthusiastic about what the future has in store.
 “I’m really looking forward to putting out an album and would love to tour North America, as well as Asia,” Yanya said. “It’s beautiful to play for the sake of music. You can’t lose the reasons why you’re doing what you’re doing and why you enjoy writing songs.”

Jordan Rakei’s first SXSW appearance was also his first time setting foot in the state of Texas, one of the few areas of the world he had yet to visit. Born in New Zealand, the international musician moved to Australia at a young age before relocating to London to spark his career. He’s since traveled far and wide, performing for and connecting with fans around the globe.

“We sold out a show in South Korea and when we got there, people were lining up before the gig to take photos, like proper fans,” he said, surprised by the country’s big crowds. “It was a seated gig which was quite weird, so everyone was very quiet, it was a really special night. They were singing along in English to all the tunes, that was crazy.”
With such a widespread following, Rakei has learned to study the tendencies of his fanbases in different areas of the world, which influences his strategy when it comes to releasing music. He often finds himself reassessing where his biggest market is, selecting singles that will best appeal to that audience in order to promote his album in the most effective way possible.
“I was sort of torn between Europe and America: Americans like soulful music, more hip-hop oriented, while Europe likes that, but more experimental,” he said. “Each decision is affected by what we think is our biggest audience. So we released ‘Sorceress’ first, and it appealed to all audiences in a different way.”
Set over a mellow groove that left room for refreshing instrumentation to float above it, “Sorceress” served as the perfect lead single to his recent album Wallflower, capturing the project’s overarching sound within approximately three minutes. Lyrically, it tied into the introverted, reclusive theme of the album together, as he tried to bring to light his struggles with social anxiety and its impact on his music career.
The album’s cover, a photograph of a young Jordan Rakei taken by his father, highlighted this theme as well and was a no-brainer when it came time to choose the art.
“I was about 4 years old and I was sitting on a bridge, and I was nervous of people walking toward me,” he said. “Me crying in the photo, it just sort of captures me being shy and introverted; that’s what [Wallflower] is all about.”
The album contained the most personal songwriting of Rakei’s career, especially in the form of a touching tribute to his late grandmother in “May.” While much of his music contains abstract wordplay to hint at the truth rather than express it outright, the song was more of a literal recollection of the moment he learned about her passing when he was only 13 years old.
“In those 13 years, we only saw [my grandparents] about twice a year, when we’d pop over to New Zealand every now and then, but it was still a really close bond,” he said. “That’s the memory I have, just them being amazing grandparents and always supportive, so it was just a dark day in my family’s life.”
Purely a beatmaker when he began making music, Rakei didn’t start writing lyrics until much later, and doesn’t think he would have been able to tell such cutting stories earlier in his career.
“The way I put words together, I didn’t have those skills back then, and I also didn’t have the content,” he said.
The passion that Rakei poured into “May” was fully evident during his March 12 showcase at the Elysium, which was presented by KCRW. Keeping his eyes closed while playing the haunting chords on his keyboard, he climbed to the upper range of his vocal register, filling the room with his melodies and connecting with the audience in the process.
Accompanied by only his drummer and programmed basslines from his laptop — which he affectionately referred to as Tom — it was a fantastic performance, although only a fraction of what he aspires for in the live setting. Rakei makes full use of production possibilities while recording music in the studio, and wants to accomplish similar things on stage, performing with a multitude of musicians rather than relying on a computer.
“With my albums, I can layer 50 things, but I can’t have 50 band members, because it just costs too much money,” he said. “I would love to perform with an orchestra 24/7, and have a choir as well. I’ve always wanted to play in a big scale, with massive production and big lighting, that’s the dream.”

Rising rapper Abhi the Nomad seemed calm, considering he was about to performing a handful of high-profile showcases at SXSW, fresh off the release of his critically acclaimed album Marbled.
Abhi the Nomad, who grew up moving every few years, addressed his unresolved visa situation in his album Marbled. Photo from Facebook.
“I remember back in 2015 we said, ‘one day we’re going to play SXSW’,” he said, talking over coffee at a North Austin outdoor shopping mall. “It was one of those ‘if only’ statements, and now it’s actually happening.”
Championed as Austin’s hometown hip-hop hero — a title Abhi accepts with great honor, yet contradicts his past history of constant nomadic travel — for the first time in his life, he finally has somewhere to call home.
“I grew up as a Third Culture Kid moving every three or four years, so I’ve traveled my whole life,” Abhi said. “Austin feels like home, I honestly feel like I belong here. They’ve taken so kindly to the record — they’ve welcomed me.”
Abhi is happy to call Austin home, but he currently stands on uncertain ground with regard to his American citizenship. After being rejected for a work visa, Abhi says he must demonstrate “extraordinary talent within the field [his] expertise is in” in order to remain in the country.
“The visa issue is overbearing,” Abhi said. “Unfortunately, only one in every three people get selected, and I just didn’t make it. Everything is tentative right now.”
Realizing how the success of his record could be a means of staying in the United States, Abhi strives to represent those who share a similar migratory background.
“There’s a whole word of [Third Culture Kids] that have lived the same way I have,” he said. “I don’t know of any musicians who are living that life, so I try to be a voice for that. I try to put all of these experiences into my music, because there’s definitely people who can relate.”
Previously “avoiding the elephant in the room” of his uncertain visa situation in his everyday life, Abhi now utilizes the story as a central motif throughout Marbled.
“The term ‘marbled’ draws from past experiences and life decisions you may regret,” he said. “Having your stripes and your scars are what make you the person you are, so acceptance is the overall theme of the record. I shied away from it for years, but I feel like at this point leaving out details is futile — I have to tell the truth.”
Wanting Marbled  “to be for all types of people of all different ages,” Abhi drew from his wide palate of musical influences when making the record – a fact that some see as an issue when attempting to categorize the album into a single defined genre.
“I want everyone to be able to relate to something on the record. I didn’t go into making Marbled thinking this is going to be a dance record, or a hip-hop record — there’s honestly all different styles of music that I love to make,” Abhi said. “I’m trying to make the best songs. I want each song to be its own monster; they don’t have to be tracks that necessarily tie everything together.”
Crafting music he describes as a “hybrid of a lot of things,” Abhi is humbled by the momentum of Marbled, and understands that it is only the calm before the storm.
“Everything matters — even if there’s 10 people in the room, you have no idea who those 10 are,” he said. “I feel like you’re always in the eye of the storm. You can’t stay in the middle, you have to stick your hand out and feel it.”
Upon his departure, Abhi articulated one final statement reminiscent of his holistic personal and artistic journey: “You have to make your own luck.”

No matter how much time one spends preparing for the SXSW Conference & Festivals, it’s truly an overwhelming event. It’s imperative to budget time wisely, but it’s just as important to remain flexible and accept that long lines, last-minute showcase announcements and even more last-minute cancellations are simply the law of the land.
The spontaneity of SXSW is part of what makes it such an incredible experience, though, and why it’s become a popular destination for people from all walks of life. With so much going on around the city, initiative is paramount. If you take advantage of the experience, you can create unexpected moments as well as career connections that will remain long after the festival has run its course. 
SXSW is all about discovery, and the more you push yourself outside of your comfort zone, the more you’ll gain from the experience. In the weeks leading up to the festival, I spent much of my time researching smaller artists that I planned to check out, yet I often found myself attending a showcase with zero background information on the person up on stage. Walking down the bustling 6th Street late at night, the air would be filled with an array of sounds from all genres, making it easy to pop into a bar to catch a few minutes of a local act sharing their story with visitors. 
Such a seamless connection between city and festival made for a warm, welcoming atmosphere throughout the week. While stopping for a drink or grabbing a bite to eat between events, I was able to learn more about the city’s culture from bartenders and servers, deepening my appreciation for Austin as the days wore on. I had been somewhat worried about local residents being resistant to outsiders overrunning their routine for the week, but that was rarely the case, as many instead welcomed the opportunity to give visitors a glimpse into their way of life.

Perhaps the biggest downside to the festival was the sheer magnitude of it all, making it easy to overextend and run yourself dry as soon as festivities get underway. Events would take place from early in the morning until well after midnight, and after a few days of skipping meals and sleep to try and take in as much as humanly possible, the blistering pace can begin to take its toll. Once I learned to succumb to the marathon and force much-needed breaks into my schedule, though, things began to fall more neatly into place, making the events that I did attend more enjoyable and beneficial.
Above all, though, it’s a wonderful opportunity to meet new people, not only for professional networking purposes, but also to experience all that the festival has to offer with new companions who share common interests. While waiting for an artist to take the stage, it’s easy to bond with the person next to you over something as small as the food truck you stopped by a few hours prior, or as large as your fascination with the entire scope of SXSW. 
With the majority of ticket options priced at over $1,000, it’s not necessarily the most cost effective spring break destination, although an abundance of free events make it worthwhile to stop by for a few days. So long as you enter with an open mind and a hunger for new experiences, you should leave with a wealth of fond memories, no matter your interests.
Why I’m smiling: Downtown Austin
Filled with organic culture and beautiful scenery, SXSW would be hard pressed to find a better location than the city of Austin, Tex. Vibrant murals enlivened the buildings and made traveling from venue to venue more enjoyable, as well as street performers who ensured that there was never a boring moment between events. The city itself has plenty of worthwhile sights and attractions outside of the festival, and made for an unbeatable combination when paired with everything SXSW had to offer.
Why I’m shaking my head: Fader Fort
In past years, Fader Fort has been perhaps the premiere unofficial showcase at SXSW, highlighted by appearances from the likes of Drake and SZA. This year, though, the three-day event featured little for fans to be excited about, making for a rather dull energy in the outdoor venue. Often it would take up to an hour to make it inside the gates, where music fans were  greeted with long drink lines and uninspiring performances from an underwhelming lineup. With the exception of a surprise Friday appearance from Rae Sremmurd, who also performed at their own showcase later in the evening, the Fort failed to live up to lofty expectations in 2018. 
Why I’m hopeful for the future: SXSW 2019
It’s never too early to dream, right?
