After two tumultuous weeks of online learning, in-person campus life is back, providing students with more campus activity options. Whether you’re looking for clubs to join or special celebrations to attend, the University has a lot to offer in the coming month. Check out these fun campus activities to keep you busy this February.
Spring Involvement Fair
Interested in joining a new student club or organization? Mark down a time to wander the Spring Involvement Fair and meet people from all different clubs and majors. With USC being home to over 850 student organizations, there really is something for everyone. This semester’s event will feature professional organizations, academic clubs, recreational sports, spiritual groups, Greek letter organizations and performance and service groups. The involvement fair will take place from Feb. 8 to Feb. 10 between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. and will feature club tables along Trousdale Parkway to greet new and returning students.
Black History Month
The University kicked off its Black History Month programming with a virtual celebration Tuesday led by President Carol Folt. It featured guest speakers from faculty and community members, and the University will continue to provide programming throughout the month.
For the artists, the USC Social Media Design Contest, which began Sunday and will run until Feb. 17, provides a platform for students to share designs that celebrate Black joy. Top designs will be printed on T-shirts and sold at the USC Bookstore, with part of the profits going towards scholarships for Black Trojans. The winning designers will also be invited to have lunch with Folt.
Following the design contest is a documentary screening of “Black Men in White Coats,” a documentary exploring the experiences and challenges faced by Black men who want to work in the medical field. The screening, co-sponsored by Dornsife Pre-Health Advisement and the USC Center of Black Cultural and Student Affairs, is on Feb. 16 at 7 p.m. at Ground Zero Cafe.
The USC Fisher Museum of Art will host the annual “Films Reflecting Ourselves (F.R.O) Fest” on Feb. 23 at 6 p.m. Featuring short films by USC Black writers, directors, producers and actors, the festival looks to platform Black stories and celebrate student expression. The event is jointly organized in partnership with CBCSA, the School of Cinematic Arts and the African American Cinema Society.
Lunar New Year
Tuesday marked the beginning of the Lunar New Year. Many clubs and organizations, including the Chinese Graduate Student Association and the Asian Pacific Islander Faculty Staff Association, celebrated virtually.
If you missed these events but still want to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the USC Pacific Asia Museum is hosting a virtual celebration Saturday at 11 a.m., featuring lion dance, martial arts, taiko drum performance and Korean music performance — it’s a celebration you won’t want to miss!
Trojan Farmers Market
After a two-year hiatus, the famous Trojan Farmers Market is back on McCarthy Quad! Hosted by USC Hospitality, Trojan Farmers Market supports sustainable agriculture and farming practices and promotes wellness and health. Every Wednesday at 11 a.m., grocery stands and food trucks provide students and faculty with a variety of fresh and delicious produce and meals, as well as crafts and handmade goods, and currently accepts cash, card and EBT.
East L.A. Taiko: Live!
Rich, booming and resonant like thunder, East L.A. Taiko’s drums will bring some energizing beats to campus. A Latino Taiko group most influenced by Afro-Cuban rhythms and taiko beats, East L.A. Taiko, led by Maceo Hernandez and Fredo Ortiz, combines Japanese taiko with dynamic rhythms from around the world. The performance will take place at Queens Courtyard on Feb. 15 at 4 p.m.
School of Dramatic Arts Acting Repertory
The USC School of Dramatic Arts will be putting on three shows for audiences at Scene Dock Theatre and Bing Theatre this February. 
“Blade to the Heat” tells the story of boxer Pedro Quinn and his experiences after his surprising victory against the middleweight champion. The play discusses boxing, sexuality and hypermasculinity in the late 1950s and was written by professor Oliver Mayer and directed by adjunct lecturer Edgar Landa. Tickets are available at select times between Feb. 17 and Feb. 27. 
“Seize the King” is a modern retelling of the Shakespearean play “Richard III” and focuses on a young, ambitious Richard and his cutthroat journey to claim the throne of England. The play, written by Will Power and directed by Michele Shay, will be performed between Feb. 16 and Feb. 26 at the Scene Dock Theatre.
Finally, the Shakespeare classic “As You Like It” is coming to the Bing Theatre Feb. 24 through Feb. 27, directed by Kate Burton. If you haven’t yet seen it or you want to relive the love story between Rosalind and Orlando and their rom-com frolic through the Forest of Arden, make sure not to miss it!
CommuniTEA
There’s no better way to destress than spending time with furry friends. The University will be holding a dog party at the University Religious Center Feb. 24 at 1:30 p.m, where students will be in close contact with cute puppies and enjoy a sound bath of meditation bells and gongs. It’s sure to be a restorative — and adorable — event.

Class of 2020 5-star quarterback Caleb Williams has chosen to transfer to USC to be with his former Oklahoma Head Coach Lincoln Riley, suiting up in Cardinal and Gold this upcoming season. 
The wait is over after Williams announced on Instagram Tuesday. Williams’ decision came down to USC and LSU, according to 247 Sports, with Wisconsin also being rumored to be in the running.
Williams began his freshman year at Oklahoma second on the depth chart behind the 2021 preseason Heisman Trophy contender Spencer Rattler. 
After Rattler’s subpar performance at the start of the Red River Showdown against Texas with the Sooners down 28-7, Riley benched him in favor of Williams. Williams went on to pass for 212 yards and rush for 88 yards with a total of 3 touchdowns in the 55-48 comeback win. Rattler recently transferred to the University of South Carolina.
The Washington D.C. native ended his season with 1,912 yards and 21 touchdowns with only 4 interceptions to earn him the fourth best QB rating in the nation at 86.5. He also ran for 442 yards and 6 rushing touchdowns, including a run for 74 yards against Iowa State.
Since he didn’t transfer immediately to USC after Riley left, Williams chose to represent the No. 16 Oklahoma Sooners in the Alamo Bowl against the No. 14 Oregon Ducks. Williams took his team to a 47-32 bowl win where he recorded 242 yards passing for 3 touchdowns as well as 34 yards rushing. By the end of the season, Williams led the Sooners to an 11-2 record and ranked No. 10 in the nation according to the AP Poll.
The dual-threat quarterback is a crucial addition to the Trojans, as they look to quickly rebuild after the Riley hire. Throughout Riley’s time at Oklahoma, he was prone to using quarterbacks that could scramble — Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray and Jalen Hurts, among a few. Joining Williams from Oklahoma, aside from the coaches, include wide receiver Mario Williams and cornerback Latrell McCutchin.
With the departure of former USC quarterback Jaxson Dart to Ole Miss, Williams will join as the expected starter in the quarterback depth chart consisting of freshman Miller Moss and possibly redshirt senior Mo Hasan, who tore ligaments in his knee last spring. 
The Trojans plan to start their 2022 season with Williams as quarterback Sept. 3 against Rice at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

More than 10 years of experiments and observations of glowing fish culminated in a discovery by researchers at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Viterbi School of Engineering that inches the scientific world closer to understanding why unpleasant memories stick around so vividly in human brains. Starting from “scratch,” the team became the first to train and study synapses in live zebrafish. 
To create memories to measure, researchers used an “unprecedented” method of training 12-day-old fish to associate a light with an infrared laser to mimic heat, which fish would swim away from to avoid. After five hours of training, the team observed and captured significant changes in the zebrafish’s brains. 
“This is the first time we will be able to see something in a very large brain region in vivo and during training,” said Zhuowei Du, a postdoctoral researcher who worked on the study.
Researchers discovered that when zebrafish form fear memories, there is a dramatic increase in the number of synapses in some, while a decrease in other regions of the brain. The finding, to some extent, overturned the commonly accepted theory that memory causes the strength of existing synapses to change, as researchers found no significant changes in the intensity of synaptic labeling.
“What was surprising was that we did not see, necessarily, a change in the size of the synapses, which would correspond to the synapse strength, and that sort of … is what the dogma is in the field,” said Donald Arnold, a professor of biological sciences and biomedical engineering and who co-led the research study. 
New methods and tools, including a new type of cell labeling and a custom-made microscope, played a vital role in the study, allowing researchers to observe the strength and location of synapses before and after fear learning occurred in the fish.
To visualize the structural changes occurring in zebrafish brains, Arnold’s team created new methods that altered the DNA of the fish so that the synapse, marked with a fluorescent protein, would glow when scanned by a laser. 
“The idea is that the fluorescent molecule is stuck,” Arnold said. “This allows you to visualize it through fluorescence microscopy.”
Researchers utilized a specialized microscope developed at USC to scan the fish’s brains and observe the synaptic changes without killing them. Scott Fraser, the provost professor of biological sciences and biomedical engineering, led the development of the microscope in his laboratory.
“Fraser’s lab [is] some of the world’s authorities on what’s known as light sheet or selective plane illumination microscopy,” Arnold said. 
Previously, Fraser’s microscope has only been used to look at objects the size of a cell, which is much larger than a synapse. As such, Thai Truong, an assistant professor of biological sciences, modified and optimized the microscope to better capture the image of synaptic alterations of living zebrafish’s brains by enhancing the microscope’s resolution. 
“We pushed the sensitivity this way and increased the laser power without damaging the sample,” Truong said. 
Truong also synchronized the microscope’s shutter speed with the heart rate of the brain in order to capture clear images.
Researchers, led by Carl Kesselman, a professor of industrial and systems engineering, computer science and preventive medicine, also developed a data management system to help the team process the massive amount of data collected from the microscope.
“We were making 3D images of the animals’ brains … but we also had to associate this data with behavioral data because we were inducing the animals to make a memory,” Arnold said. “It was really quite a complex problem from a data management point of view.”
To combine the miscellaneous types of data and generate the fluorescent images of the zebrafish brain, Kessleman’s team developed a unique algorithm that wipes out the noise and lighting that impaired the scanned image.
“There’s miscellaneous garbage floating around in there that glows at the same wavelength that you’re looking for,” Kesselman said. “So, we would kind of go through and clean that up.”
As such, precluding the distracting light signals, researchers combined myriad data with behavioral data to compute the density of synapses, thus analyzing the brain activities while learning and memorizing.
Although the study proposed a primitive theory of memory formation, its classical conditioning associated with aversive stimulus has been linked to the study of PTSD.
“When someone has a traumatic event, there will be some sort of neural sensory experience that goes along with that event,” Arnold said. “Synapses that proliferated or disappeared could be an indication of why these particular memories are so robust.”
Concurrently, Arnold’s team started developing technologies that could erase new synapses formed by memory, which could possibly contribute to the treatment of PTSD.
“That would be down the road,” Arnold said. “It would certainly indicate that that might be a way that [treatment for PTSD] could be done.”

Jihoo Kim’s difficulties with the Duo two-factor authentication system come in the form of small inconveniences. Having to race from one room to another to verify the login on her phone while working on her computer presents a problem for both Kim and her roommate, the former, who has missed “so many classes” on Zoom because of the double authentication requirement. As cell phones aren’t allowed in some of her classes, Kim has found Duo, which operates exclusively on mobile phones, a “hassle.”
Beginning Jan. 20, students were required to use Duo to add extra protection into their USC systems that require the NetID sign-in process. While Kim, a junior majoring in international relations, understands the importance of security and keeping information safe, she is among many students who aren’t “huge fans” of Duo.
The prevalence of worldwide ransomware incidents has “regulators and insurers [sic] now requiring a type of added protection for email accounts,” according to Gus Anagnos, USC’s chief information security officer. A ransomware attack occurs when a hacker takes the system containing sensitive information hostage and demands a ransom in exchange for unlocking the system. The added protection through programs such as Duo, known as multi-factor authentication, helps raise the likelihood of the right person signing into that email account. 
“Think of it like an alarm code in addition to the key to your front door — to better prevent criminals from using your USC email to send malicious emails to other Trojan Community members, including those who have access to sensitive data and systems,” Anagnos wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Nicolas Marquez, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he believes Duo is a safe alternative and is relatively effective and easy to use. But the process of Duo still bothers him. “It is annoying especially when you kind of just need to go into MyUSC or get something quick,” Marquez said. “Sometimes some of my friends don’t have Wi-Fi or their phone’s dead, so then they can’t even log on on their computer.”
While the change is recent for students, University staff members have used Duo for the past few years. For Jenn de la Fuente, an adjunct professor of public relations, Duo was bothersome at first but has since “melted into the background.”
“It’s something that people have to get used to,” de la Fuente said. “So much is tied to our USC ID that it’s almost a no-brainer to have an extra layer of security.”
According to Anagnos’ statement, the implementation of Duo aims to protect users’ sensitive information, including addresses, birthdates, social security numbers and medical records. When logging on, Duo offers three options as authentication past a username and password: “Send Me a Push,” “Call Me” and “Enter a Passcode.” According to the Duo guide, Duo recommends using the “Duo Push” feature, which can only be done through the Duo Mobile app. 
Carol Zhou, a sophomore majoring in public policy, recently discovered the Duo Mobile app but has only used the call and text options. Zhou said her issue with Duo is its “timing” as the app often loads slowly and takes a while to call her.
“Typing in the code takes a long time because it doesn’t auto enter,” Zhou said. “And when [Duo] calls me, I don’t want to disturb the people around me … I understand where it’s coming from, but it’s so inconvenient.”
Though viewed as inconvenient, MFA services like Duo can block up to 99.9% of account compromises, which are a very common entry point for ransomware attacks, Anagnos wrote. 
As someone who has been previously hacked, de la Fuente said she also uses two-factor authentication on her personal Gmail account for the extra layer of security it provides. She said she believes people need to be aware of internet security. 
“It’s a smart idea to implement in a lot of other things in our lives,” de la Fuente said. “We do so much via email. We have so much of our information online.”

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence.
The Interfraternity Council at USC has been under fire for years, but this heightened when allegations of drugging and sexual assault surfaced against the Sigma Nu Fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity and other fraternities in October. All eyes were on campus leadership as students protested the University’s late notification of the allegations to the student body and its lack of action.
Some students demanded institutional reform. Others demanded total abolition of the IFC. But absolutely no one advocated for the band-aid solution that the IFC Culture, Prevention, and Accountability Working Group presented as its “Preliminary Action Plan” on Jan. 14.
The plan’s biggest takeaway was its declaration that each fraternity chapter will restrict socializing to houses’ common areas and “will strengthen its practice by requiring the posting of security not only at entry points and gathering areas, but also at stairs or hallways leading to bedrooms.”  
In other words, the working group brainstormed since Nov. 11 a response to sexual assault and violence within Greek life, which culminated in an unsound requirement that fraternities hire babysitters to supervise their members.
The new policy implies that the University accepts that fraternity houses are packed with rapists, and it has several fallacies. First, its reputability depends on student trust with those security guards. The plan states that the “Security vendors will be selected in consultation with the university,” which honestly leaves us with more questions than anything. Who are these vendors? What are their credentials? Have they specifically trained in drugging and rape prevention? What role will security guards play in preventing sexual assaults?
This plan also assumes that sexual violence only happens in bedrooms. Convicted on three counts of sexual assault, former Stanford University student Brock Turner sexually assaulted a woman behind a dumpster. 
If anything, the bedroom guards will only help fraternities avoid accountability. If a fraternity brother assaults a person outside of their chapter’s house on the Row, it may be easier for the IFC to claim that the incident was unrelated to Greek activities. 
Instead of addressing the role fraternities play in enforcing rape culture, this plan tells fraternity members: “Do what you want but not under our roof.” Further, fraternities often hold unofficial events at satellite houses or other locations, which is a simple way chapters can dodge the security requirement. 
The public’s negative response to this plan was rather predictable. Verified Instagram account @itsonus shared a Los Angeles Times article reporting on the update, which received comments such as “[I] didn’t know this university could stoop any lower,” “Reminds me of a highschool dance,” and “If you can’t have parties that don’t harm people, you don’t get to have parties!” I can’t help but agree with the outraged commenters — is this really the best solution USC could offer?
The Preliminary Action Plan does include other requirements: “Prevention Education,” “Pre-Event Planning and Post-Event Review,” “Risk Management” and “Accountability to Community Standards.” However, these conditions mostly depend on individual responsibility and faith in each fraternity member’s obedience. Participants of previous Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention Services education workshops will attest that it is very easy to keep your attention at a minimum at these workshops and still meet compliance. 
If fraternities appear to adhere with the “Preliminary Action Plan,” USC will allow fraternities to “begin a limited calendar of social gatherings” on Thursday, with a full resumption on March 3. USC plans to hire a “Compliance Coordinator” to ensure all conditions are met, and an event review committee will review “risk management plans” and “security implementation” with chapter leaders each week. 
I hope for the best — that this plan will succeed in mitigating sexual violence in Greek life. Yet, I cannot ignore the reality that this plan fails to present any real institutional solutions. All it does is imply that sexual assault in Greek life is a mere situational problem that can be cured with a band-aid and some babysitters.
Correction: The following article was updated on Feb. 1 at 9:20 a.m. to correct spelling and grammar mistakes. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors. 
Clarification: This article was updated on Feb. 1 at 9:20 a.m. to clarify that the IFC Culture, Prevention, and Accountability Working Group’s new policy implies USC’s acceptance that “fraternity houses are packed with rapists.” A question regarding security guards’ role in preventing sexual assaults was also updated for clarity.

Prior to attending USC, I made a simple, yet uninformed, deal with my parents as I looked toward the next four years. I would live the “freshman experience” by residing on campus a year, but afterward, I would live from home and commute.
The only resource that I personally looked at was a single Reddit page on r/USC titled “To commute or not commute.” Apart from that, it has been word of mouth on essentially everything else throughout my freshman year on campus. So, after spring break ran a bit longer than expected, I finally embarked on my commuter lifestyle last June, working at the University over the summer. 
At the time, the “honeymoon” phase — the freedom of going practically anywhere in my car — got to my head. Now, a semester in, I have my quarrels but will refrain from mentioning the word “regrets.”
With gas prices through the roof, cars that park over the lines and the $500 price tag that comes with a parking pass for the year, it often feels pointless to try and commute. What’s the point of swinging by campus if I have only a single class for the day, or if I know that I’ll be caught up in traffic if a club event runs long? Certainly, the hybrid modality that came with the pandemic was a temporary solution, but eventually, we’ll all have to make our way to campus.
There shouldn’t have to be a tradeoff in choosing to live away from campus, especially if that choice isn’t yours to make. Sure, it’s not all bad. I save a bit of cash that will eventually be thrown at a medical school (hopefully), and I get to spend more time with my family and my dog. But, that stress on debating whether to make the drive, knowing that the University will do nothing to help alleviate that for you, can be overwhelming, to say the least.
Even when I do try and pack all of my classes together to avoid unnecessary drives, the responsibilities with extracurriculars or work-related events still force me to haul down the freeway.
In retrospect, I do not have a particularly intense commute, but the nature of going to and from the University can be exhausting, considering that it seems like everyone else on the road is out to get you. Being the managing editor or just working on the paper in general is exhausting. As I stroll out of the newsroom at midnight and make my way up the stairs to the parking structure, I can really feel the life drain out of me, and soon after, comes the sudden realization that I have to drive myself home. However, I’ve been grateful just to have a space to rest and stay for a while. 
Especially for those who purely rely on the public transport system, the commuter lifestyle can pick at and wear you out physically and mentally. As many avid and starry-eyed freshmen come to learn, the Metro or Big Blue Bus or Culver City Bus lines aren’t the most fabulous by any means, nor is it the most convenient, but for many, it’s all we have. 
That’s not even mentioning the social limitations of being a commuter. In many ways, I’ve lost time that could’ve been shared with my friends or just relaxing with them. That feeling of FOMO really snuck up on me, with thoughts that, maybe, if I was in their position, it would be a bit of a hassle to ask the commuter to make their way back down and then wait for them. It stings even as I write this article from home. The thought of missing out on spending time with my friends hurts as they live five minutes away from each other, while I would have to fight the traffic just to get there. 
Members of the Undergraduate Student Government previously advocated on behalf of commuters, including the creation of a commuter hub similar to that of UCLA’s. However, that conversation has been happening even prior to my first steps on campus. Whether it’s meeting people who want to carpool to save a bit of cash or having a place to sleep for the night when you can’t drive home, we must actually establish a place that allows commuters with the long haul to rest while simultaneously helping those who are new to the lifestyle. 
So when you’re driving your kids or grandkids to school, think “Back in My—” Actually, maybe just focus on the road. Drive safe, besties.
Lois Angelo is a junior writing about the perks, downsides and necessities of the commuter lifestyle in his column, “The Carpool Lane.” He is also the managing editor at the Daily Trojan.

It’s Friday night, and all anyone in line outside of Exchange LA could talk about was their excitement about finally seeing Cosmic Gate. 
Initially released in summer 2021, Cosmic Gate’s latest album, “MOSAIIK Chapter One,” was intentionally delayed in touring, likely to avoid uncertainty because of the coronavirus. Even now, as the latest variant takes another jab at the live performance world, many fans took all coronavirus precautions to see the masters of the trance genre live.
Known for their somewhat chaotic and somehow monotonous sound, trance music – Cosmic Gate’s speciality – has always faced a dichotomy of interest. Due to the duo’s unique sound, dance music fans typically love it or completely hate it, but those prone to trance music have the distinct ability to discern characteristic traits in the production of artists such as Cosmic Gate.
“You get a lot of trance artists that just kind of fold into themselves,” said Ulises Vargas, a music reporter for the electronic music publication EDM.com who attended the concert. “With Cosmic Gate, they just kind of know what’s up, so every new song, every new record, every new album is always fresh.” 
And Vargas wasn’t wrong.
With a prolific discography that spans more than two decades, Cosmic Gate, consisting of Claus Terhoeven (better known by his pseudonym Nic Chagall) and Stefan Bossems (or simply ‘Bossi’ for short), have managed to acquiesce to contemporary sounds in their 23 years together. The duo made this transition in not only the trance music scene but also the dance music scene. 
The pair became well known for constantly adding its own unique spin to its work. This malleability is a huge part of why many fans stuck around since the very beginning. 
Some fans discovered Cosmic Gate through contemporary trance DJs of the early 2000s like Armin van Buuren and Tiësto. These DJs started to explore the idea of creating mixed compilations using CDs for its “A State of Trance” and “In Search of Sunrise” mix series.
Its compilations subsequently allowed DJs to showcase their talents to mix music, while simultaneously exposing their audience to the then-uncharted worlds of dance music where Cosmic Gate was still susceptible to anonymity. Through this, many artists and their future fans discovered each other, with Cosmic Gate’s “Exploration of Space” being the conduit of discovery by many of its fans.
But those days are fortunately in the past as electronic dance music has ascended into the mainstream, allowing for fans to discover new content every day. Now, fans can much more easily discover Cosmic Gate.  
Last year during lockdown, many record labels turned to the streaming platform Twitch to facilitate live streams which allowed their artists to continue to perform remotely. 
Yet, after a year of techno and house dominated online streaming performances with the likes of Dirtybird Records, Insomniac Events and Desert Hearts, dance music fans are excited to hear something new. Fans are looking into a whole new genre and turning to Cosmic Gate. 
Friday night’s concert would turn anyone into a fan of Cosmic Gate. Taking full advantage of the phenomenal sound system at Exchange LA, the evening was truly a night to remember. 
It was almost serendipitous that the first track of Cosmic Gate’s album “MOSAIIK Chapter One,” “Blame” featuring vocalist Diana Miro, would be playing at the very moment many audience members reached the top of the stairs.
The energy evoked from the dark rhythm of the duo’s attempt at combining techno’s underground aesthetic with trance’s accelerated speed brought a level of electricity to the dance floor reminiscent of a time before the coronavirus. 
The MOSAIIK tour will run through mid-May with 20 additional stops across the United States and Canada.

Look, it’s OK you didn’t get around to reading a lot last year, no one blames you. 
When does anyone have time to pick up a book when we’re suffering from Zoom burnout or running late to newly in-person courses because you didn’t know that the “BB” in front of the room number signified took place in the building’s basement? 
Now that the student body is more settled into campus — and you’re feeling guilty for not making a dent in your New Year’s resolution to reading more — it’s time to pick up a book again. Below is a mere handful of some of the great books from a not-so-great year to help you catch up on what you might have missed. 
“Crying in H Mart” by Michelle Zauner
Michelle Zauner, lead singer of pop band Japanese Breakfast turned-author showcased her writing talents by producing one of the most powerful memoirs of 2021: “Crying in H Mart.’’ Zauner’s debut explores a lifetime through a Korean American lens, an identity that, at times, Zauner felt ever so distant from. 
After her mother’s cancer diagnosis and eventual passing, Zauner began to reimmerse herself into the culture her mother had gifted her with, proving a deeply emotional account from an immensely lyrical voice. 
“Beautiful World, Where Are You?” by Sally Rooney
Sally Rooney, BookTok extraordinaire, has wowed yet again. Coming off of the immense success of her first two books, “Normal People” and “Conversations with Friends,” Rooney is back with her third novel, providing another portraiture of modern couples befuddled with miscommunication and shared anxieties. 
This time, the focus hones in on the quartet of new characters: Alice, Simon, Felix and Eileen. More mature, more authentic and still lacking any evidence of quotation marks, the third installment of the Rooney Regime is more than worth the read.    
“Cultish: The Language of Fanaticism” by Amanda Montell
Language scholar Amanda Montell takes her background to a whole new level in “Cultish,” diving into the linguistic styles and tricks to help groups gain and maintain cult-like followings. 
While we assume we can never be easily brainwashed into cults à la Jonestown or the Manson ‘family,’ Montell exposes us, declaring that we already have — just not in the ways we would expect. Whether it be Glossier, Peloton or the self-identifying Swiftie, Montell illustrates through insightful anecdotes and digestible research how simple syntax can program our next move or obsession. 
“Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty” by Patrick Radden Keefe
“Empire of Pain” is a follow-up to Keefe’s 2017 article, “The Family That Built the Empire of Pain, initially featured in the New Yorker. The “family” in particular is the Sacklers; Keefe draws most of the attention and inquiries specifically on their founding of Purdue Pharma and the part the dynasty played in the opioid epidemic. 
This in-depth analysis of the family’s contradictory efforts of plastering its name and likeness to numerous philanthropic efforts while simultaneously erasing any ties it had with the manufacturing and marketing of OxyContin is a riveting page-turner. 
“Fight Night” by Miriam Toews
Strikingly, a nine-year-old named Swiv narrates this heartwarming story. It chronicles three generations of women, including Swiv, her pregnant mother and her elderly grandmother. 
Swiv chronicles her home life and the lessons gifted to her by her lively, wise and witty grandmother. Toews gifts us a novel full of hilarious teachings centered around surviving and fighting in this world. In short, it paints a beautiful, yet intimate, portrait of interpersonal relationships between women. 
“Tacky: Love Letters to the Worst Culture We Have to Offer” by Rax King
Perhaps one of the funniest books to come out of a particularly unfunny year, Rax King’s “Tacky” serves as a perfect potion of nostalgia and escapism, taking us back to our pre-adolescent days. While it’s classified as an essay collection, it feels more like a bundle of prepubescent love letters dedicated to our guiltiest pleasures that allow the reader to simply enjoy them as they are. 
With topics ranging from “America’s Next Top Model” to Bath & Body Works’ Warm Vanilla Sugar to “Jersey Shore,” you will be nothing short of entertained while reading this treat (even if it’s a constant reminder that you are getting old).
“Let Me Tell You What I Mean” by Joan Didion
Of course, no book list is ever really complete without Ms. Didion. Although notable for being the cherished writer’s last published work, it doesn’t give this volume of collected essays enough credit on its own. These pieces, ranging in publications between 1968 to 2000, allowed Didion to flex her coolness and critiques on us mere mortals once more. 
A standout essay about Martha Stewart, “a business icon” was “Everywoman.com,” which remarkably displays the premonition-like quality of Didion’s work that makes you wonder if she had seen the future before we’d ever gotten to experience it. Besides this essay, every single sentence in the entire book, as always, was forthright and incisive gold.
Even if you don’t end up picking up any of these stellar options above, hopefully this list inspired you to get ahead on this year’s reading, so you don’t miss out (again).

Welcome to the first issue of my spring column: “Coast to Coast.” My name is Yoav Gillath and I’ll be your guide for hoops across the country. We’ll cover NBA and NCAA basketball from coast to coast, honing in on overlooked teams and players. Today, I’ll dive into a crowded Eastern conference, bring you tales from the Big 12 and even climb onto the sinking ship that is this year’s Los Angeles Lakers.
Let’s get to it.
Ochai Agbaji — Clutch Player Of The Year
Kansas senior guard Ochai Agbaji has lit the world on fire over the last stretch of games. Agbaji hit a game-winner, a double-overtime forcer, and secured a game-sealing rebound in the span of three days. 
In the first game, the Jayhawks overcame a 16-point halftime deficit to beat in-state rivals Kansas State. With seven seconds on the clock, Agbaji dropped in a tough layup to put the Jayhawks up 76-75. After a game-winning, 3-point attempt clanked off the rim, Agbaji brought down the rebound and put his team up for good at the stripe. 
Two days later, Texas Tech came into Allen Fieldhouse and pushed Kansas to overtime as Agbaji missed a potentialgame-winner at the buzzer. Not to be denied, Agbaji sent the game to double-overtime with a deep 3 five minutes later. The Jayhawks went on to win the game 94-91. 
Not only does Agbaji have a convincing National Player of the Year case, I would argue we should create a Clutch Player of the Year award and hand the inaugural edition to the guard from Kansas.
Are the Lakers finally heating up?
No. 
Sitting at 24-27, the Los Angeles Lakers are hanging around the bottom of the Western Conference playoff picture. Forward Anthony Davis has put up gaudy lines recently, tallying a monster 8-point 2-rebound effort against the Brooklyn Nets on his return from injury last Tuesday. An optimist would say this could start a season-changing run for the Lakers, but this columnist is not one. 
Even with all three members of their “Big 3” (Russell Westbrook, Davis and LeBron James) on the court, the Lakers have not looked like a dominant outfit this season. Far from it. 
The Lakers might boast more “Not Top 10” appearances on ESPN’s SportsCenter than wins. 
Is Auburn a basketball school?
Auburn sits at No.1 in the AP poll for the third-straight week — the first time in school history. 
As five-time football national champions, the Tigers have traditionally filled the football powerhouse position. However, Head Coach Bruce Pearl has also turned the basketball program around in recent times, adding another weapon to the school’s athletic arsenal. 
In 2019, Pearl led Auburn to its first Final Four ever. That team fell short of a national championship, but the current edition has a shot to do what those history-makers couldn’t. 
What makes this season’s team so great? Maybe they’re not so great after all. 
Kenpom.com has Auburn pegged as the 6th best team in the country, with the NET ranking similarly slotting them in at No. 6. Solid rankings, but they don’t quite line up with their No.1 AP ranking. 
This might be a case of a lack of quality matchups giving the Tigers a boost in the rankings (an effect I call the “Gonzaga effect”). However, Auburn owns the second-most Quadrant 1 wins in the country. I think this might just be a quirk owing more to the teams around them than their own performances.
Throwing elbows in a tight Eastern conference
Two and a half games. Not three, not four, two and a half. That’s how many games separate the top six teams in the East a couple of weeks before All-Star Weekend. 
The Miami Heat own the top spot in the conference with recent wins over the Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers. All-Star (and USC alumnus) forward DeMar DeRozan has powered the surprising Chicago Bulls to half a game behind first place. No Ben Simmons, no problem for the Philadelphia 76ers who are sitting pretty at third. 
A resurgent Cleveland Cavaliers team is hot on their heels, led by strong NBA Coach of the Year candidate J. B. Bickerstaff. The Milwaukee Bucks and New York Nets remain in the hunt for home-court advantage, but the Nets have dropped their last four. 
With the play-in tournament introduced last season now a staple of the NBA, look for teams sitting between seventh and tenth in the conference to surge over the home stretch.

It’s more than midway through the NBA season and former Trojans across the league are making an impact for their respective teams on offense and defense. Young NBA teams are continuing to trend upward and compete with some of the league’s best players. With the starters for the NBA All-Star game announced last week and the reserves to be announced this upcoming Thursday, here are some updates on USC alumni.
Power forward/center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
One of the most surprising teams in the NBA this season, the Cleveland Cavaliers have gone from the Eastern Conference team with the third-worst record to fourth-best in the standings. Former Trojan big man and third overall draft pick Evan Mobley finds himself as the favorite to win Rookie of the Year amid his team’s success this year.
Mobley currently averages 15 points, 8.2 rebounds and leads all rookies in blocks with 1.7 blocks per game. Last Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks, Mobley scored 16 points, grabbed 7 rebounds and had 2 blocked shots as the Cavaliers beat the defending NBA Champions 115-99. Mobley also had the signature highlight of the game as he dunked over the reigning Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Against the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, Mobley performed another solid play as he scored 18 points, grabbed 9 rebounds and blocked 3 shots in a 115-105 loss to the Pistons. 
Apparent in these two games against Milwaukee and Detroit, Mobley continues to showcase his potential to the young Cavaliers team on the rise in the East.
Center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls
Former Trojan center Nikola Vucevic has made his presence felt this season in Chicago. Vucevic averages a double-double with 16.8 points and 11 rebounds per game and has helped guide the Bulls to the Eastern Conference’s No. 2 spot.
The Bulls have won three of their last four games and Vucevic has played a key component in Chicago’s success. In a 111-110 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder last Monday, Vucevic had a dominant double-double with 26 points and 15 rebounds. He followed this performance with 17 points and 15 rebounds in a victory against the Toronto Raptors, along with 18 points and 8 rebounds in Chicago’s loss against the San Antonio Spurs. 
Vucevic has established himself as one of the most skilled big men in the league and, even though his numbers are down compared to previous seasons, he complements his Bulls teammates perfectly.
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
DeMar DeRozan has played some of his best basketball for the Bulls as they continue to remain first in the Eastern Conference standings. The former Trojan averages 26.4 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists on 50% shooting from the field and a career-high 34.6% from 3-point range.
Following his season-high 41 points against the Magic, DeRozan scored 29 points in a victory against the Raptors, 32 points in a loss against the Spurs and 23 in a victory against the Blazers. 
It has been an eventful first season for DeRozan in Chicago beyond his plays. In the middle of arguably the best basketball plays of his career, DeRozan was forced to miss time because of the NBA’s coronavirus protocols from Dec. 4 to Dec. 17. 
The former Trojan also made NBA history this year, becoming the first player to make consecutive game winners at the buzzer in consecutive days. On Jan. 27, he was also recognized for his superb play this year by being named an All-Star starter for the third time in his career.
Guard De’Anthony Melton, Memphis Grizzlies:
In his fourth season in the NBA and third with the Memphis Grizzlies, former Trojan De’Anthony Melton has averaged 9.8 points, 4.5 rebounds and tied for seventh in steals per game with 1.7.
Although mostly a reserve for the Grizzlies this season, Melton has had some noteworthy performances. On Dec. 2, the Grizzlies beat the Oklahoma City Thunder by 73 points with a final score of 152-79. Melton scored 19 points and had 6 rebounds and 5 assists while shooting 80 percent from the floor. 
Melton scored his season-high of 22 points against the Clippers earlier this season in October and recently had back-to-back 13-point outings in victories for the Grizzlies against the Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards. 
His scoring contributions off the bench are one of the many reasons Memphis is the third seed in the Western Conference.
