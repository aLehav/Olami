Two suspect in a robbery were apprehended two hours after the student reported the theft of his iPhone because of a cell phone application Friday.
A male USC student on the 2300 block of Portland Street was held at knifepoint while walking and listening to music on his phone. The victim called DPS right after the robbery.
The Dept. of Public Safety used a GPS tracking device on the cell phone through the MobileMe app to find the suspects.
The phone was tracked from the DPS office while a joint LAPD-DPS team went to find the location of the phone. The suspects were found walking on the 1100 block of Pico Avenue a few miles from USC campus, DPS. Capt. David Carlisle said.
“Besides good detective work, the fact is that technology was a major factor in this investigation,” Carlisle said. “Without a smartphone, it would have made recovering it very difficult. It would have taken a lot of leg work, and there is no guarantee this crime would have ever been solved.”
Carlisle recommends students download tracking apps because they can be useful tools during an investigation.
“Students, most of whom have smartphones, may want to take the time to download [tracking] apps,” Carlisle said. “In the event that they lose it or it’s stolen, it would aid investigators in the recovery of property, and this case, in the possession of the suspects.”
The success of the tracking device in the robbery has motivated others to download tracking apps on their phones.
“This incident definitely inspires me, not just so that I can get my phone or computer back but also so that police are able to find criminals more easily,” said Mallorie Maranda, a sophomore majoring in psychology..
MobileMe is an Internet service from Apple that syncs your Mac or PC with your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with emails, contacts and calendar events and also enables you to locate your missing devices. iPhone users can activate MobileMe to download the Find My iPhone app without purchasing MobileMe services.
The Find My iPhone app allows iPhone owners to track the location of their phone using Google Maps, send a message to a possible finder and erase all information on their iPhone.
David Samson, a junior majoring in business administration, said that having a tracking app on a smartphone is essential.
“This technology is the future,” Samson said. “Human error, like leaving your cell phone on a park bench, combined with technology and the ability to find your phone is incredible.”
Shouldn’t DPS have sent out a campus wide alert telling people phones are being stole by suspects with knives?
If DPS was tracking the phone and the robbers, there wasn’t much reason to tell you about it, Steve.
Remaining alert is step number one.  Avoid being an easy target and you won’t have to rely on apps on your devices.  Criminals are stupid, but they’re also unpredictable.  Keep this in mind, especially the young females out there in the (USC) area..  Nevertheless, good to see some punks got scooped up.  Good work DPS and LAPD.
There are apps for Android phones that do the same thing.  Lookout is one that is free and easy to use.  The use of these apps will certainly stall the career of a few of these thugs who take the easy way out in life.
Thanks for the article! This app looks serious.
When I plan to make serious apps I use snappii web service. With its professional development team I can make unique apps.

Trojan Vision will broadcast its first true high definition programs today, after receiving  $400,000 from the Office of the Provost to buy equipment that allows it to film, edit and broadcast in high definition.
TV in HD · Cassie Bussing, a junior majoring in cinematic arts and a Trojan Vision executive producer, works at the station. Trojan Vision is available on channel 8.1. - Daily Trojan File Photo
The station acquired four HD television cameras, two 65–inch monitors, one computer graphics machine, five Mac Pro processors, one HD video mixer, more than 20 computer monitors, a new router, master switcher, three new interface amplifiers and a vector scope for measuring color in images.
The new cameras enable students working at the station to film in HD and the rest of the equipment allows them to produce, edit and broadcast the video.
Trojan Vision General Manager Peter Lansworth, a junior majoring in film and television production, said the switch was a response to changes in what type of televisions people have now.
“A lot of students are upgrading to HDTVs,” Lansworth said. “You don’t even see standard definition televisions being sold at major outlets now.”
Though the station still used standard definition equipment, it began broadcasting its shows in HD last semester by using an “upconversion” machine.
Lansworth said the process filled in missing information so standard definition images can be shown on a high definition screen.
“If you’re watching a standard definition television, then it’s much more of a square than widescreen,” Lansworth said. “[The upconverter] takes that box and stretches it and adds some extra data in the places where it wasn’t before.”
Television screens show images line-by-line and more lines create a sharper image. Standard definition TVs have 480 horizontal lines, whereas HDTVs have 1080 horizontal lines, so the upconverter fills in the space.
Lansworth said students will notice the difference in the clarity of images.
“It was a lower quality picture signal — not the crisp, sharp one you’re used to seeing on HDTV,” Lansworth said. “Now we have high definition at every step.”

The largest fundraising campaign in USC’s history officially launched Thursday and Friday. A kickoff event was held at Bovard Auditorium on Friday and was attended by university officials, students, faculty and alumni.
Fundraising · Alumni gather at International Plaza as part of the kickoff for the Campaign for the University of Southern California. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The event included speeches by President C. L. Max Nikias, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett and several senior faculty members conducting breakthrough research.
Students reacted enthusiastically to the Campaign for the University of Southern California, but critically to where the funds would be allocated.
Allyson Brown, a senior majoring in neuroscience, said she agreed with the university’s plan for doubling its endowment — which currently stands at $3 billion — so that USC can maintain its status as a leading research institution.
“This fundraiser is very important because we need to spend more money on creating world-class research projects to maintain our status as a world-class institute,” Brown said.
Garrett said an increased emphasis will be placed on research as the USC hope to solidify itself as a top-tier university.
“USC is poised to become one of the greatest schools in the world and this campaign will help us realize this goal,” Garrett said. “Also, this campaign will cement the university’s place among the top research institutes in the country.”
Some students had their own ideas on how the university should use the new funds.
Alex Carreon, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said the university should use some of the funds to help the community.
“USC is already such a wealthy university,” Carreon said. “We should donate a part of these funds to help the community which is not that well off.”
Garrett confirmed USC would be giving a portion of the money to charities such as the Good Neighbors Program, a six-year pre-college program designed to prepare low-income neighborhood students for admission to USC.
“USC is already donating $1 million a year to the Good Neighbors Program and we expect this amount to increase once the funds are raised,” she said.
President Nikias said the campaign is focused on faculty and students. During his speech, he spoke about the history of the university and how it was founded on the principles of hard work and innovation.
“Uncertainty is always the beginning of adventure,” Nikias said. “With this $6 billion campaign goal, we are embarking on our own adventure of a lifetime. We know our journey will not be a short one or easy one.”
The Good Neighbors Program in not “a six-year pre-college program designed to prepare low-income neighborhood students for admission to USC.” You’re thinking of the Neighborhood Academic Initiative. The Good Neighbors Program is a USC-run community outreach pool, related to the United Way Campaign, that awards block grants to area non-profits that partner with USC to serve the community.

All new members of Greek organizations attended workshops about how to represent their community appropriately during their first annual retreat Sunday.
Retreat · Attendees received a free lunch from one of five food trucks at the retreat Sunday. New members of houses in all Greek councils were required to attend the event. - Andrea Shen | Daily Trojan
The mandatory event was one of several recommendations by the Greek Task Force, created last semester when the university put The Row on a social probation. When Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson lifted the ban Sept. 7, he said it was because of the planned implementation of this event among other measures, such as building a stronger relationship with the Dept. of Public Safety and strengthening risk management teams.
New members of the Panhellenic, Interfraternity, Professional Fraternity, Multicultural Greek, Asian Greek and National Pan-hellenic councils attended five workshops in classrooms from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and a keynote speech from Lost Angeles blogger Zack Jerome from 3 to 4 p.m.
Sarah Choi, PHC vice president of new member education, said the event was the largest of its type that the Greek community had ever sponsored.
“This is something that IFC and Panhellenic usually do separately, but they’ve never done it to this extent and this scale,” Choi said. “We’re trying to get away from the whole connotation. It’s not supposed to [be about] breaking down the rules. The idea is [focusing on] what it means to be Greek and a Trojan.”
The event was spearheaded by IFC president Pat Lauer and Panhellenic Council President Ayushi Gummadi, IFC Vice President of New Member Education Michael Madden and Choi.
They also worked with Beth Saul, assistant dean of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, who said the event would inform and unify new members.
“This is one way for all new members from the chapters to hear one message,” Saul said. “This is all important information for new students and the Greek community to be educated about.”
Saul said the budget for the event came from the vice president’s office, the Greek endowment and IFC and Panhellenic budgets. Choi said they began planning the event in April, determining which aspects of student life would be explored in workshops.
Several representatives hosted workshops on a variety of topics. The DPS discussed risk management, USC MenCare discussed consent and healthy relationships, faculty speakers discussed academics, Wellness and Health Promotion Director Paula Swinford discussed sexual health and alcohol awareness and Teach for America discussed philanthropy and community service.
Jerome concluded the event by discussing how Greek students should be proud to represent USC, not just their own houses.
“It’s important to me to talk to the new crop of kids and tell them what they do while they’re here is important,” Jerome said. “They have to make the best of their time here.”
Attendees had mixed reactions. Hannah Kim, a freshman majoring in public relations, said the retreat was too long.
“It was a very good idea and I appreciate the thought, but I didn’t feel I learned that much,” Kim said. “I don’t think it was worth the entire day. They should get student feedback and continue to improve.”
Burke Gibson, a freshman majoring in economics, said he thought the event was useful.
“It’s a great idea to make sure everyone knows how they should be acting on The Row,” Gibson said.
Choi said the event would help refocus the Greek community.
“We definitely had tension with the administration and they had to pull the reins back on us,” Choi said. “For all the new members, especially freshman coming in who don’t know what’s going on, we want to help them get a positive start.”
Correction: A previous version of this article mistakenly referred to the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion as the Office of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.

The USC women’s soccer team has struggled for consistency in 2011, and Sunday might have been the team’s most uneven and frustrating defeat yet.
Not enough · USC senior forward/defender Ashley Freyer knotted the score at one early in the first half. Portland, however, notched a goal in the opening minutes of the second half that proved to be the game-winner. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
The visiting Women of Troy fell 2-1 to Portland, losing their third straight and falling to 3-6 on the season.
“Disheartening,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin. “That’s really all I can describe it as.”
USC fell behind early when the Pilots’ Ellen Parker scored just three minutes into the match to give Portland a 1-0 lead.
“We can’t be giving goals away three minutes into the first half,” Khosroshahin said. “That’s been the theme all year long. It totally changed the game. With a team like us, that’s struggling to finish, and you let teams get ahead, it’s a tall order to overcome.”
The Women of Troy fought back and tied the game in the 29th minute, when senior Ashley Freyer collected a loose ball in front of the Pilots’ net and booted it in the back of the net for the equalizer.
“We did create opportunities to get back into it,” Khosroshahin said. “We just weren’t able to push it all the way. We hit the post a couple times. We need to see if the ball is going to start bouncing our way.”
It was the last score of the afternoon for USC, who had plenty of opportunities to take the lead. Senior Ashli Sandoval had three chances of her own, but all three failed to evade Portland goalkeeper Hailee DeYoung.
“It’s frustrating because we are playing well,” said junior forward Kristina Noriega. “We just need to keep doing what we’re doing but figure out how to get results out of it. It’s definitely a feeling of frustration.”
Portland, however, capitalized on the USC defense to begin the second half of play when Amanda Frisbie scored in the 49th minute with what proved to be the winning goal for the Pilots.
Senior Brittany Kerridge had USC’s best chance to tie the game in the final minute, but missed a free kick from 30 yards out. Junior Kristina Noriega’s desperation attempt in the closing seconds also missed the mark, and USC suffered its sixth defeat on the season.
“I just feel like we let this one get away,” Freyer said. “We were trying to start fresh after we let two get away at home. We’ve definitely been getting the opportunities to stay in games. We just haven’t been finishing them.”
Though not excusing his team’s loss, Khosroshahin did note that he feels the team has been unlucky at certain points during the season.
“We’re going to keep kicking it but at some point something’s got to go our way,” he said. “So far this year we haven’t gotten the bounces. I hope it starts to happen soon.”
The Women of Troy return home next weekend to begin the Pac-12 schedule when they take on Washington State at 1 p.m. at McAlister Field.
Disheartening? How about embarrassing? Texas fans were overheard as they left the field saying the USC team with all their national players were a joke.  I wonder what the Portland fans were saying yesterday.  The class that came in last year was touted as the best freshman recruiting class ever.  What has happened to them?  As sophomores, only two are noticeable on the field, the GK-1 and MF-11.  The junior class is non-existent with the exception of 12 who isn’t playing.  5 is the only senior who seems to care and gives it all.  What’s up with the new freshmen and transfers? Those are the only players the coach could find that are worthy to be at SC?  I think not! Lazy recruiting!

The Cardinal team defeated the Gold team, 275-263, in the Trojans’ annual intrasquad scrimmage Friday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The meet came down to the 300-yard women’s freestyle relay, where the Cardinal was able to pull away and win the match.
Sophomore Yumi So and freshmen Chase Bloch and Dimitri Colupaev led the Cardinal team.
So won the 25- and 75-yard backstroke events, while Bloch won the 25- and 75-yard fly. Colupaev won the 25-yard breaststroke and 100-yard individual medley. Junior Alex Lendrum was also a winner in the 300-yard individual medley.
The winning 300-yard freestyle team was led by So, sophomore Christal Simms, sophomore Haley Anderson and freshman Stina Gardelli.
Though the Gold men’s team was able to respond with a win in its 300-yard medley, it was not enough to hold off the Cardinal.
Gold’s Kate Shumway took home a win in the 25-yard freestyle while Anderson took home the top spot in the 300-freestyle. Simms (25-yard free), Gardell (100-yard individual medley) and junior Victoria Ishimatsu (1-meter dive) were winners in their respective events as well.
The Trojans begin their season Oct. 22 against Cal State Fullerton at home, while the Women of Troy will face Washington State from Oct. 21 to Oct. 22 in Pullman, Wash.

It was just like old times.
USC won its third straight game of the season, defeating the Syracuse Orange 38-17. USC, trailing for the first time in the season after a field goal by Syracuse kicker Ross Krautman, managed to rebound and respond with 24 unanswered points.
Senior running back Marc Tyler was named the starting tailback before game time and had 15 carries for 41 yards, while adding three receptions for 46 yards.
Tyler made his 2011 season debut for the Trojans last week against Pac-12 opponent Utah. In his two starts, Tyler has a combined total of 39 carries, 154 yards, one touchdown and four receptions for 65 yards.
“We went with Marc early on because we knew Syracuse would play tough against the run,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Marc is an asset in pass protection and that was a big part of our game as we went with the vertical pass game tonight.”
Despite not seeing consistent playing time in the first two games, junior tailback Curtis McNeal managed to make the most of his opportunity against Syracuse. McNeal had five carries for 79 yards for the Trojans.
“Curtis McNeal is the real neat story of the day,” Kiffin said. “He ran well and made plays on special teams.”
—
Syracuse quarterback Ryan Nassib started 11-for-11 in the first quarter for 74 yards.
After the first quarter, however, Nassib was just 14-of-26, finishing 25-of-37 for 230 yards.
“It took some time for us to adjust to the formations that they were coming out in,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “[Syracuse] showed some stuff they hadn’t used against anyone else.”
With his first 11 completions, Nassib had completed 22 consecutive passes in a row, dating back to the Rhode Island game. He fell four passes shy of the FBS record of 26 completed passes in a row, held by then-California quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
With 25 completions, Nassib now has 312 in his career at Syracuse and becomes the seventh Orange quarterback to complete at least 300 passes.
—
USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley tied a school record by throwing five touchdown passes in a single game. Barkley had previously tied the record last season against Hawaii and California. Barkley threw for 324 yards, and all his touchdown passes went to five different receivers.
Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer, senior fullback Rhett Ellison and freshman tight end Xavier Grimble all added touchdowns for the Trojans.
Telfer’s 44-yard touchdown catch was the first of his career.
“I already knew what the offense was going to be, where the quarterback was going to place the ball,” Telfer said. “Once the ball was snapped, I just had to catch the ball.”

Unlike the two previous games, where the USC defense had to close out the game, the Trojans did not have to be concerned about a potential game-winning field goal.
“This is great momentum [for us] coming into the Arizona State game,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “We just got to focus on the mistakes that we have, clean them up in practice and come out for another great week.”

The USC women’s cross-country team took the San Diego State Aztec Invitational by storm Saturday, placing third out of nine teams. Running at an invitational known for its rough terrain and hills, the Women of Troy reached an average time of 19:16.36.
Freshman Erica Capellino placed first for USC and second overall, posting an 18:27.8 in her first official collegiate meet. USC coach Tom Walsh waited to debut Capellino until this meet, knowing her strengths would work to the team’s advantage, and was pleased with her performance.
“Capellino was the standout runner,” Walsh said. “I was happy with the way she attacked the hills, and she competed very well for the entire 5,000 meters. It certainly didn’t look like it was Erica’s first race of the season.”
Six freshmen and redshirt junior team captain Jessica Lundin were the seven USC entrants in the race. After last week’s start, Walsh was pleased the runners were able to improve on their performances.
Freshmen Erin Matranga, Erin Robinson and Shannon Byrne finished within two seconds of each other for 18th, 19th and 20th places, respectively.
Freshman Austin Lundin placed 22nd, with a time of 19.33.0, while freshman Kira Soderstrom and Lundin finished back-to-back in 28th and 29th place, with respective times of 19.55.5 and 19.56.8.
“Place was more important than time in this meet as everyone ran slower times than they usually do,” Walsh said. “Erin Matranga ran strong on the hills, [and] ran her best race of the season.”
Because of the hilly terrain, all entrants posted relatively slower times than they would have on a flat course. The team ran a slower race than last week’s at the UC Irvine Invitational, but USC’s performance was more what Walsh expected of the runners.
“The course was challenging and very hilly for everyone,” Walsh said. “The team is improving from week to week, and we are headed in the right direction. We have two weeks to prepare for our next race at Pomona Pitzer, and I am looking forward to these next two weeks of hard training.”
The team’s next race is scheduled for Oct. 1 at the Pomona Pitzer Invitational in Claremont, Calif.

The USC women’s volleyball team bounced back after a sweep at the hands of its crosstown rivals at home last week, knocking off No. 4 Washington (25-20, 28-26, 25-20) and Washington State (25-17, 25-15, 25-11) in straight sets.
Road warriors · Senior middle blocker Lauren Williams led USC with 15 kills in the Women of Troy’s win at Washington State Saturday. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
No. 13 USC (7-3, 2-1) went into Pullman Saturday and handily defeated the unranked Cougars (8-4, 0-2) behind a dominating offensive performance, as the squad hit .447 on the evening.
“There was no letdown against Washington State, which was great,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “The team was really focused.”
Senior All-American middle blocker Lauren Williams led all players with 13 kills while hitting .571, and Fuller added 12 kills for the Women of Troy while hitting .579.
Two dominant runs in the first and third set keyed the victory for USC.
The team broke away from a 4-4 tie in the opening set with a 15-5 run, then followed that with a 16-5 burst in the closing set.
“We were really good at attacking throughout the match,” Haley said. “They couldn’t handle a 6-foot-5 body in the middle like [Williams].”
USC started its trip handing Washington its first loss of the season Friday. It was the team’s first victory against the Huskies (9-1, 1-1) in Seattle since 2003.
Sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw and junior outside hitter Katie Fuller both recorded career highs with 15 kills to lead the Women of Troy.
“I thought we had a chance to beat Washington,” Haley said. “I just didn’t know it would be a 3-0 win on the road. But we took advantage of a good situation. We played consistent[ly], made [just] a few errors and pulled it out.”
After the UCLA game, Haley decided to move Shaw into the starting lineup in favor of sophomore outside hitter Kirby Burnham, who saw limited action against the Washington schools.
The lineup change worked.
Shaw hit .513 in the two matches while recording a total of 23 kills, 17 digs and two blocks.
“Sarah has been sick for a long time, and is just now looking like she’s getting stronger,” Haley said. “[Shaw] actually has more playing experience than Kirby, and it looks like she has her confidence now, too.”
Sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund tied a school record against the Huskies for most digs (30) in a three-set match, and senior All-American setter Kendall Bateman had 41 assists.
USC comes home for two of the toughest matches on its schedule, squaring off against No. 1 California (13-0, 3-0) and No. 2 Stanford (8-1, 2-1) next weekend.
“It’s going be a real battle against Stanford and Cal next week,” Haley said. “Cal is the No. 1 team in the nation, and Stanford is going to want to come in here and win after losing to them last week.”
The Women of Troy host California at 7 p.m. Friday, then play Stanford at 6 p.m. Saturday evening.

Back in 2009, when then-USC coach Pete Carroll named Matt Barkley the Trojans’ starting quarterback — over Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain — his rationale behind handing the job to the wide-eyed freshman signal caller was simple.
“He has all the physical ability, he has the mentality and temperament to handle the position,” Carroll said.
Carroll opted to start an 18-year-old freshman from Newport Beach over Corp and Mustain, who had a combined five years of collegiate experience. It was a surprise. It was ridiculed at times. It led to a ho-hum 9-4 season.
But it’s paying off now.
Barkley, now a junior, has thrown for 892 yards, nine touchdowns and one interception through three games this season, putting him on pace for 36 touchdown tosses a year after throwing 26. His completion percentage is currently at 68.9 percent. And on Saturday, in the Trojans’ 38-17 rout over Syracuse, he looked as good as ever.
Against the Orange, he went 26-of-39 for 324 yards and five touchdowns, tying USC’s single-game mark for the third time in his career. All five of those touchdowns went to different receivers. Similarly, he connected with eight different wideouts. It was arguably his best performance to date. He was accurate. He was efficient. He was consistent.
In the first quarter, he hooked up with senior fullback Rhett Ellison on a five-yard swing pass for a score. In the second quarter, he found sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods open in the endzone for a 31-yard touchdown. In the third quarter, he found freshman wideout Marqise Lee streaking down the north Coliseum sidelines for a 43-yard touchdown, giving the Trojans a 21-point lead.
“He knows if [Woods] or another receiver is not open, he can come to me,” said Lee, who was playing in just his third college game. “We have that trust there.”
Two years ago, Carroll used every possible adjective to paint Barkley in a positive light. He called him “remarkable,” “extremely talented” and said great things were expected of him. At times, it seemed excessive, towing the line between confident and unrealistic, as the Trojans went on to lose four games, the most since 2001 at the time.
But now with 27 starts under his belt, he remains on track to live up to the billing, as evidenced by his display at the Coliseum Saturday night.
“He played well for us again,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said with a touch of brevity.
It hasn’t been easy being Matt Barkley, who has never exactly been dealt a favorable hand.
He was thrown into the fire as a freshman, subjected to a wide range of criticism that comes with the position.
He battled injuries, missing starts against Washington in 2009 and Notre Dame last season.
He has been forced to grow up fast, becoming the face of a program as a 19-year-old sophomore after it received the harshest NCAA-levied sanctions since the SMU death penalty in 1987.
He never had the chance to sit and wait. He never got to hold the clipboard. He never got to run the scout team during practices. His predecessors Mark Sanchez and John David Booty didn’t start full time until their fourth seasons with the program. Matt Leinart never attempted a pass until he was a redshirt sophomore.
Barkley’s second collegiate game took place at The Horseshoe in Columbus, Ohio, against nationally ranked Ohio State. The ink was still drying on his signed national letter of intent.  He had just attended commencement at Mater Dei. His graduation tassel was still close by.
The youth showed, at times, but if there was ever any doubt Carroll should have tabbed Barkley as the starter two years ago, that has slowly eroded.
Barkley has turned into arguably the best pure pro-level passer nationally, along with Stanford’s Andrew Luck, becoming a Heisman Trophy candidate as well. Not to mention Corp and Mustain went 0-2 as starters.
But if anything, two years of starting experience has prepared Barkley for a season like this. A season where, if the ball bounces right, USC could finish with at least 10 wins for the first time since 2008. A season where he could receive a wide number of postseason awards. A season where statistically, at least, could be on par with past Heisman winners Leinart and Carson Palmer.
“Having two years in the system helps a lot,” Barkley said when asked about his progression as a starter. “And our guys are really making me look good out there.”
He knows the experience has helped. He’s more confident, more accurate, more collected.
And although the Trojans can’t celebrate New Year’s in Pasadena, he knows he can bring a glimpse of the past back to USC — at least for now.
“It’s about time,” Barkley said Saturday of the Trojans’ blowout win. “It kind of felt like Trojan football again.”
The NFL can wait. A bowl game can wait. At 3-0, USC could have its best team in recent memory, and for Barkley, who has suddenly become one of the best signal callers in college football, that might be just good enough.

For the first time all season, the Trojans trailed.
Record tying · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley (above) tossed five touchdown passes in the Trojans’ 38-17 win over unranked Syracuse, tying a school single-game record. He had thrown for five touchdowns in a game twice before — against Hawaii and California last season. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
It didn’t matter, however, as USC (3-0, 1-0) scored 24 unanswered points en route to a 38-17 victory over Syracuse.
“It is really nice to get a win like the old days,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We are really pleased to get to 3-0 this week. Our guys fought all night long for us and I’m really proud of that.”
On Syracuse’s (2-1) opening drive, quarterback Ryan Nassib completed 8-of-8 passes for 55 yards, which culminated in a Ross Krautman 21-yard field goal.
But the USC offense responded quickly, reeling off 17 consecutive points heading into halftime.
The Trojans responded with a 10-play, 66-yard drive on junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s five-yard touchdown pass to senior fullback Rhett Ellison. Barkley completed five passes to three different receivers for 57 yards on USC’s first possession.
Barkley finished 26-of-39 for 324 yards and five touchdown passes, which tied a USC single-game record. Barkley also achieved the feat against Hawaii and California last year.
“I didn’t notice until I looked up at the board late in the game,” Barkley said. “I think that was because of how we spread the ball around tonight. We had a full game on offense and everyone pitched in. It feels good and we needed this.”
Barkley’s five touchdown passes gave USC balance and other options in the passing game outside of sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods.
Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Barkley, however, still looked to his favorite receiver as Woods caught eight passes for 82 yards and a touchdown. The eight receptions gave Woods 33 receptions through three games, which is the most in a three-game stretch in USC history.
His 31-yard touchdown pass to Woods extended the USC lead to 14-3 with 10 minutes in the second quarter.
After the USC defense forced a Syracuse three-and-out, freshman kicker Andre Heidari nailed a 26-yard field goal — his second of the season — minutes before halftime to give USC a 17-3 lead.
The USC defense, which struggled to stop opponents on third-down conversions last season, allowed the Orange to convert on 4-of-5 third-down opportunities in the first quarter. In the second quarter, however, the Orange was 0-of-5.
Nassib, who started 11-of-11 for 74 yards in the first quarter, was just 2-of-10 in the second quarter for 12 yards.
The USC defense also limited the Syracuse offense to just 34 total yards in the second quarter.
“This was a big night for us on defense,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “The first two weeks we gave up too many big plays and big drives. Tonight, we were able to avoid that.”
Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
With a comfortable lead going into the second half — much like the previous two games against Minnesota and Utah — the USC offense wasted no time getting on the scoreboard.
Four plays and 64 yards later, the Trojans extended their lead to 24-3 after Barkley’s 44-yard touchdown pass to redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer. The touchdown was the first of Telfer’s career.
The Orange responded right back, however, as Nassib completed two passes for 37 yards and wide receiver Lemon lofted a 28-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Van Chew.
In the previous two games against Minnesota and Utah, it seemed as if USC would let another opponent make it another close ballgame.
Syracuse seemed re-energized with the score, forcing USC into a quick three-and-out. A Nassib completion for 33 yards to tight end Nick Provo put the Orange at the Trojans’ 37-yard line.
Syracuse was poised to make it a one-score ballgame but junior defensive end Wes Horton and senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris brought down Nassib for an eight-yard loss, ending the Orange scoring threat.
“I feel like our defense played great,” said sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey. “Our coach has talked about finishing games, and we came out here and finished this.”
Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Two more Barkley touchdown passes — a 43-yard pass to freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee and a nine-yard strike to tight end Xavier Grimble — finished the scoring for the Trojans, giving USC its highest-scoring total since registering 48 points against California last season.
“Telfer, Grimble and Lee all came up big for us tonight,” Kiffin said. “I’m proud of the improvement they showed. Guys are going to make mistakes starting out for them, so for them to contribute for us tonight really gives us something to build on.”
USC travels to Tempe, Ariz. next weekend, Sept. 24, to face Arizona State. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:15 p.m.
The Sun Devils (2-1) are coming off a 17-14 loss to Illinois. They are led by junior quarterback Ross Osweiler, who has thrown for 871 yards and six touchdowns through three games this season.
Technically, USC answered with 23 unanswered points.  The 24th was answered by a Syracuse touchdown.
Sorry, but that expression has always irritated me so that’s why I am being an ass about this post. :)

Encountering the things we loved as kids can cause a dissonance. It’s a clash of our ideals as adults versus children. 
There’s a confused nostalgia when one realizes some things no longer cast the spells they did years ago. Or that those same things carried far more subtext than we realized.
Any distortion caused by Disney’s two-week showing of The Lion King 3-D, however, can most likely be attributed to wonky 3-D effects that do nothing to improve upon a classic.
This is not to say the movie is not as good as ever. It totally is. From the sweeping cry of the opening song “The Circle of Life” to the fiery spectacle of the film’s climax, The Lion King remains among the greats of Disney’s staples.
For those who skipped childhood, The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion destined to rule his father’s kingdom. His evil uncle Scar, voiced by the sinister and dulcet Jeremy Irons, has other ideas, and commits fratricide to nab the throne. It’s Hamlet with kitty cats and warthogs.
The story still carries the same simple, beautiful charm as it did in 1994. Wizened, younger adults, however, might pick up a couple more plot hiccups than their guileless four-year-old selves — for example, why are Nala and Simba betrothed if they are from the same pride and therefore have the same father? Did our parents notice this accidental incest twist?
Thank goodness Fanfiction.net did not exist back then.
On a behemoth screen, unseen details give new feeling and respect for the artistic medium — the tears in Simba’s eyes when he sees his father in the sky, the twinkling of the stars on the savannah and the broken whiskers on Mufasa’s muzzle after Simba finds him in the gorge. The big numbers are twice as glorious. “Be Prepared” is deliciously menacing, “Circle of Life” is stirring and passionate and the wildebeest stampede will leave your eyes just as wide.
But the real show-stopper is the audio. Disney went all-out to assemble a cast of excellent voice actors, and hearing them in the re-release is even more stirring. Hearing Irons as Scar, Nathan Lane as Timon, and James Earl Jones as Mufasa is nothing short of epic. Expect a breathless moment when Mufasa calls down to Simba from the sky. The songs, too, are richer and more layered than a standard television can ever express.
As just a re-release, The Lion King is worth every penny. Its 3-D re-release is not.
3-D is a weird niche. In some films — like The Nightmare Before Christmas or How to Train Your Dragon — it genuinely works.
But those are films that already have an element of perceived depth.
In a very-much 2-D film, it’s weird.
The backgrounds receive more “3Dizing” than the characters.
This makes the characters appear flatter by comparison and spoils the contrast between the characters and landscapes. Think paper dolls on sticks. Sometimes the 3-D even interferes with the animation and causes certain moments to blur. Pumbaa’s epic beat down of the hyenas demands better.
A special re-release would have been better served as an IMAX event. Once again, the film studios seem more concerned with the money-grab aspect, as a 3-D film costs about $4 extra at L.A. Live. Luckily, most big cinemas also have showings in regular 2-D. Be a square and see this one — it’s a much cleaner experience, and you won’t get a headache from the 3-D glasses.
Classics remain classics for a reason. The Lion King is a hallmark of animation as well as a children’s story. Some cynical older folk might not get the same youthful thrill from just the plot anymore, but the songs and artwork are gorgeous regardless of age or technological advancement.
One final word of caution — for those who do not frequently attend children’s films, pick a showing 10 p.m. or later. Otherwise, you might find several squalling infants playing backup during “Be Prepared.”

You might be surprised to know that the supposed heart of Koreatown, a small strip of Third Street and Wilshire Boulevard between Wilton Place and Vermont Street, does not belong to the Koreatown community, but is listed in the official city map as Little Bangladesh.
Local luxury · Little Bangladesh, ironically located in Koreatown, is home to a slew of Bengali markets and shopping areas, such as Aladin, a small sweets market known only to the local Bengali community. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
Even more surprised were Korean civic groups, who had assumed the three-square-mile urban district west of Downtown which — for three decades has housed the highest density of Koreans outside of Seoul — was already officially Koreatown. That is, until a committee of Bangladeshi businessmen formally filed an application to the city late 2008, requesting the small Bangladeshi-concentrated patch at Third Street be officially designated as Little Bangladesh.
Koreatown activists, disconcerted and indignant, fought to quash an attempt that they interpreted as an encroachment into their front yard. The Bangladeshi community, equally indignant, argued every ethnicity deserves a special place in American soil. It’s a familiar Los Angeles battle: a clash between mainly immigrant groups over a common desire for territorial identity and national pride.
Two years later, Little Bangladesh has earned a blue sign signifying official recognition of its growing Bangladeshi population. Boundaries between Little Bangladesh and Koreatown might have been set in print, but in actuality, the four-block stretch is still an odd jumble of Bangladeshi groceries, Thai BBQ restaurants and Korean boba cafes.
Little Bangladesh still isn’t yet a thriving shopping district like Little Tokyo, nor does it have an ornate welcome gate like Chinatown. It’s a pocket within Koreatown into which you stumble unknowingly, only to realize that the blocky squares and circles of hangul (native Korean alphabet) on signboards and posters on windows have been replaced with florid Bengali script of horizontal lines.
The best places to visit for an authentic bite aren’t the sit-down restaurants but the grocery stores. Authentic Bengali dishes are more often served from steam trays at inconspicuous family-owned stores that double as a cultural center and neighborhood market.
Aladin Sweets and Market, located on Vermont Avenue, is one. Half-shrouded by a tree, Aladin is a small shop known only to the local Bengali community. If you are not Bengali and don’t speak Bengali, you’ll stick out like a sore thumb, but that’s a good thing, because both owners and customers will gladly help you out.
Ask nicely, and they will take you on a little tour around the shop, proudly boasting they store common Bangladeshi products from curry mixes to imported frozen hilsa, Bangladesh’s national fish. They might even show you a Bengali cuisine cookbook (apparently hilsa can be cooked 100 different ways), or a picture book listing all the native fruits and seafood.
At their prepared foods counter, try their shingara, a pyramid-shaped Bengali samosa of spiced potato encased in a rich, chewy piecrust. They also have a puff pastry version, a wonderful mix of onions, vegetables and ground meat nested in a light, multi-layered buttery crisp.
But the star of Aladin is its sweets. Rasgulla is a sticky, deep-fried creamy ball of fresh curd cheese and semolina flour soaked in rose water syrup.
Chom chom is a dense, ultra-sweet log of boiled-down cream and milk mixed with flour, sugar and a touch of saffron. The treat is steamed, soaked in syrup and sometimes rolled in coconut flakes.
Kala jamun is a similar oblong cake except darker brown in color with a scarlet coconut-like filling. All of these sweets are served cold, and most delicious with a cup of strong, bitter coffee.
Swadesh, on Third Street, is another similar market. Like Aladin, it stocks many Bangladeshi products and ingredients, including an impressive showcase of spices and an array of native crackers and cookies. On any given day there will be a small group of Bangladeshi men loitering around, browsing in and out of the store and chatting in their native language.
If you’re not used to Bengali food, you might find some of the dishes excessively oily, but don’t let that turn you off. Expect bold, punchy flavors; Bangladeshi dishes aren’t shy with spices, especially mustard seeds and oils.
Bangladesh has an abundant variety of curries, from eggplant to beef. Make sure to ask for their hilsa curries, a rich, gravy-laden fish dish. The delicate white flesh of the river-caught fish tones down the fiery notes of the sauce, and tastes excellent mixed with rice. Goat biryani comes with long grains of fragrant basmati rice and tender, fall-off-the-bone chunks of goat meat.
Swadesh’s pakoras — crispy, doughy fritters made from different mixtures like onion, cauliflower, potato and chickpeas — are a must-try. Though Swadesh doesn’t fry these deep-fried snacks to order, somehow the batter stays fresh and crispy, with a distinct taste and texture from the chickpea flour coating.
Little Bangladesh is still years away from being a commercial district, but for the Bangladeshi community, it’s about gaining official acceptance and a sense of belonging in a foreign turf with a multitude of races and cultures. At any rate, it is an intriguing gem, one of the many unique ethnic enclaves that make Los Angeles such a distinct and exciting city.

Though midsummer is prime time for action movies, director Nicolas Winding Refn’s latest film hit theaters just last Friday and stunned audiences with its originality. 
It is easy to write off this macho film as a cinematized Grand Theft Auto, yet Drive contains several elements of other genres that separate it from other action films. There is the bittersweet romance between Ryan Gosling’s dark character and the sweet Carey Mulligan, the timing and suspense of an Alfred Hitchcock flick and the sense of grim justice that prevails mostly in the crime genre. In short, Drive caters to audiences who want to think, not just see things blow up or cars transform into alien robots.
In addition to being thought provoking, Drive is also aesthetically pleasing. Aside from featuring beautiful celebrities, Drive has stellar cinematography and makes great use of sound. The title sequence features beautiful aerial shots of Los Angeles and several scenes shot from within the car itself. To heighten suspense, there is rarely a time when an actor is featured center frame, making one wonder whether something ominous will approach from the left or right sides of the screen.
Gosling plays an unnamed character who is a stuntman by day and driver by night. Darting from gig to gig, Gosling is uncomfortably content with his job until he falls for his sweet but reserved neighbor Irene (Mulligan), accompanied by her lovable son Benicio. When Irene’s husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) comes home from prison, trouble starts.
Despite a somewhat convoluted plot, Drive makes a name for itself by creating interesting, dynamic characters.
For example, one immediately wants to judge Gosling’s character based on his appearance. For the entire film, Gosling never smiles unless speaking with Irene. He wears either a denim getup or his trademark white, racecar-esque jacket, which later he will not even bother to wash the blood off of. Gosling even goes so far as to give off stereotypical tough guy posture. He delivers lines behind the beat, hunches his shoulders and keeps his face down low, making it clear he is not to be messed with.
Yet Gosling’s character also has a unique sense of justice. The man has no qualms about driving robbers on their heists, yet he makes it very clear that all he does is drive.
“If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place,” Gosling’s character says. “I give you a five-minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes, and I’m yours no matter what. I don’t sit in while you’re running it down. I don’t carry a gun. I drive.”
Nor is the character especially violent — that is, unless he is provoked or forced to protect. In fact, all of Gosling’s actions are the results of a deep need to protect Irene and her son. He gives no thought to his own safety or well-being.
Mulligan’s character Irene is also abnormally innocent, unlike the sexy, bad-girl type of Megan Fox or Angelina Jolie. Mulligan never shows her skin, and hides behind long-sleeved shirts and floor-length skirts; she gives every impression she needs to be protected.
Also, like Gosling’s character, she is distinctively quiet. Watch as Gosling and Mulligan, falling ever so subtly in love, communicate for several seconds without speaking. There are no heavy declarations of love or passionate lovemaking scenes. In fact, there is only one kiss in the entire 100 minutes. Their relationship is purely emotional, and does not even serve as the focal point of the film. Much of Drive features Gosling fighting to protect Mulligan instead of actually falling in love with her.
Despite the bittersweet romance, Drive is not for the faint of heart, and is rated R for good reason. The film features heavy and disturbing scenes of gore. A woman is shot in the head and blood and brain matter erupt all over the room. A man is stabbed in the forehead with a fork and blood spews everywhere. Gosling’s character stomps a man to death, deforming his features and marring his face so badly that blood and brain collect in a deep pool underneath his corpse.
In all fairness, however, the film does warn the audience of approaching violence. The gory bits are often shown in slow motion, leaving plenty of time for the viewer to notice the gunman in the window or Gosling preparing to pummel his attacker.
The verdict? Drive is definitely worth the $14 shelled out at L.A. Live, as it presents something for everyone to enjoy.
Clearly there is nothing original about this film, it does not succeed as either an action movie nor a character study.  If one were to take David Lynch’s masterpiece ” Blue Velvet”, delete the best parts and insert the tortured driving sequences of male prostktute Julian Kaye in “American Gigolo”, then you basically have “Drive”.
Even the most simplistic parts of the film were poorly considered and researched, a broken down POS ex ARCA racecar was presented as a plot device worth 300k, you can buy it for 20k.
The director wanted to be David Lynch, he wanted the same haunting themes that Gorigo Moroder created in the 1980’s and failed at both efforts,  this film may be named “Drive”, but it never gets out of Park.

If Joan Holloway’s seductive strut in the award-winning television show Mad Men is any inclination, we’re living in the curvy era.
You’d think with all these beautiful, curvaceous women running around, we as a society would be more inclined to accept beauty of all different types.
The USC Women’s Student Assembly held “Love Your Body” week last week, as part of a larger effort to embrace all body types, as opposed to the one the media imposes on us.
Yet somehow women still idolize models who are at a level that’s genetically unattainable.
While First Lady Michelle Obama is running her “Let’s Move!” campaign, she neglects to focus on the most important kind of health: emotional.
One does not need to be Einstein to realize the media and our society are consumed with the idea of beauty.
We live in a world where girls constantly tell their friends they are ugly only so they can receive a compliment and the cries of “No, you’re not! You’re like, so gorgeous.”
We open magazines and see not ourselves, but these beautiful goddesses who have the ability to strike such fear and sadness in women just because of the way they look.
Rail-thin models have unfortunately become normal for us. So normal, in fact, that plus-size models are considered the minority in the fashion world.
Why are these curvy, beautiful women considered the minority when the average American woman is a size 14, according to The Cleveland Plain-Dealer. That’s right — 14. Not 4, not 2, not 6. 14.
Critics of plus-size models find themselves in a peculiar situation.
If they disagree with having healthy women represent clothing lines, that means they support the anorexic women lining our magazine pages.
This is the world we live in. If I call an extremely skinny  girl “anorexic,” that is just as disrespectful as if she were to call someone “fat.” Both sides are offended.
Skinny girl stereotypes include claims of anorexia or bulimia while curvier girls have to live with people calling them emotional overeaters.
The success of positive self-image lies in people taking a stand for health, whatever shape that might be. Some might think  healthy is an all-organic diet and a six-pack.
But, being healthy means being the size you are naturally supposed to be, which is different for every girl out there.
This is the real problem.
Women compare themselves to other women when every single body is different. Even if I were 125 pounds, I would look nothing like Gisele Bündchen because our bodies are built differently.
Women need to start respecting themselves for the shape they were given, not the shape they desire. If that means being a size 0, so be it. If that also means being a size 16, then it’s fine because it’s your body.
If someone is unnaturally changing his or her weight, by excessively overeating or by throwing up or by starving, that is when we would need to take action.
Acceptance is the beginning of emotional renewal. Even though we thought our mothers were lying to us every time they said, “Every one is beautiful in his or her own special way,” it actually rings true.
 
Sheridan Watson is a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts-critical studies. 
I think the author is clearly successful with bringing out the emotion behind obesity and anorexia.   We can quote statistics and give opinions, but God forbid if one should actually feel good about the weight they are carrying.  No need to get up in the morning, stay down.
I agree the First Lady is doing an amazing job with her campaign “Lets Move”.  Unfortunately the jury is still out on the next generation of young minds who are watching their parents receive treatments like botox, face lifts, liposuction, all in the name of obesity, anorexia and ageless beauty.  I think we should all race to check statistics and leave our emotions at the door.   It’s academic.
The fact that the average American woman is a size 14 (and the average men’s waist size is now about 36”) is not a means to critique our cultural body image. It’s actually a statistical symptom of a growing obesity epidemic in this country. The sad reality is that Americans are so sedentary and have such poor diets that overweight has become the new average. This is not something we should celebrate or even accept. The phrase “healthy/beautiful at any size” is absurd. There are simply some body masses that are never healthy. Carrying too much extra fat places enormous strain on your joints and organs and can lead to all kinds of circulatory and digestive breakdown. The relationship between obesity and health problems is a matter of incontrovertible medical consensus. Telling people that it’s OK to be overweight is a very dangerous message to be spreading.
And the tired excuse of “I’m naturally overweight” is absurd. There are only a small minority of people for whom obesity is the result of genetics. Genetics didn’t make our obesity rates suddenly explode over the last 20 years, poor lifestyle habits did. The vast majority of people who are overweight are overweight because they eat too much and don’t exercise enough.
And yes, anorexia/bulemia/etc are also very unhealthy. I’m not defending that either. But obesity is (statistically) a far, far, far, far greater problem for our society than these eating disorders are. Obesity-related illness kills literally hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. There are, at most, a couple hundred deaths from anorexia a year. To suggest that these are comparably-pressing public health issues is simply not an accurate statement.
This popular idea that the only two options in life are to look like Kate Moss or to look like Christina Hendricks is a false dichotomy. There is in fact a healthy middle ground between size 0 and size 16, and it’s something that most of us need to get back to before it literally kills us.
Eating disorders have the highest mortality rates of any mental health disorder. At least 20% of people with anorexia will die prematurely due to complications–and only 1 in 10 people with an eating disorder actually receives any treatment for their disorder. And it is estimated that up to 24 million Americans suffer from an eating disorder (including Anorexia, Bulimia, Binge Eating Disorder, and EDNOS). The rates of eating disorders and health problems resulting from them ARE very significant and important. And so is the obesity epidemic. The two issues need not be in conflict or competition with each other. They are both centered around dysfunctional relationships with food and unrealistic expectations for our bodies. We all need to work on finding balance in our diets and our lifestyles.
This article is just so poorly written, I can’t really take it seriously. I lost all respect for the author and the article when the author baselessly criticized the First Lady for promoting healthy lifestyles, more nutritious diets, and increased activity levels among segments of the population with the highest obesity rates and weight-related illness rates in the U.S…. Emotional health is inextricably linked with physical health. When our bodies are being nourished properly, our emotional stability tends to follow. When we get adequate exercise and physical activity, we boost our endorphins and thus our mood. Encouraging people to find healthier outlets for their emotions (instead of using food to regulate them, whether through starving oneself, bingeing and purging, or emotional overeating) makes people healthier all around.
It’s hard to believe that with all the statistics somehow we always loose sight of what’s being served to families all over the country.  Some people will never have a chance to be healthy or thin because in their community, restaurants and grocery markets are serving a very low quality of what’s being called food.   Until this changes we will always have obesity and anorexia.  This is emotionally disturbing to some.
I appreciate the intent of this article, but it has some critical flaws. The onus appears to be left on women for somehow subjecting themselves to this, when in reality, the issue is with our culture at large – men, women, media, you name it. 
“Yet somehow women still idolize models who are at a level that’s genetically unattainable.”
– Women learn to accept particular women as idols. While of course there’s personal choice involved here, we have to consider the forces at work that lead women to accept and reject particular notions of womanhood and beauty. 
“Women compare themselves to other women when every single body is different.”
– Women are instructed to compare themselves to other women (again, by men, women, and other cultural forces at large.)
You’re identified a lot of key points, but I think it would also be useful to consider WHY women are lead to these behaviors, which you have aptly described as destructive.

The phrases “Beat UCLA” and the more fiery “FUCLA” are commonplace Trojan-pride slogans that pit USC against the school across town. But beneath the rivalrous repartee between the two universities are serious issues in California’s higher education system brought to light by the current crisis in the UC system that even USC students not directly impacted by the crisis can’t afford to ignore.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
UCLA and the rest of the University of California campuses are in the midst of a long-term financial downturn, brought on by extreme budget cuts followed by increasingly higher tuition. The last two years have seen an outpouring of student protest that has frustratingly produced only more cuts and higher tuition, placing more financial burden on those who deserve it the least: the students.
For the first time ever, the UC system is getting more money from its students via tuition than from state funding. This puts California higher education in a crisis of such immense proportion that it might not be a crisis but instead the new normal.
These changes put in motion a historic educational shift that affects all members of the California education system, public and private, short and long term.
Yet there’s a divide, a disconnect, even a rivalry in USC’s case, between California’s public and private universities. Though bridging the gap will not magically solve the UCs’ problems, it could provide a source of support as well as potential for a re-invented, re-invigorated state education system.
There are many possibilities for an alternative future; increasing access to four-year schools (the UCs, California community colleges and private schools alike) and attracting more international students or lowering costs for native Californians while bringing more bright minds to the Golden State.
California’s private institutions should step in to bridge the gap between private and public by rejecting unproductive comparisons and capitalizing on and increasing academic interaction.
USC’s rivalry with UCLA is fun when it comes to football, but it is so trumpeted and over-emphasized that it drowns out the possibility for valuable academic overlap between the two schools. The most informative and engaging class I’m enrolled in this semester is actually taught by a UCLA adjunct professor.
Increasing access is also key. USC should find ways to offer students what they can’t get in the public university setting at the moment. Offering more financial aid and creating a summer-school program that allows state students to take classes at USC at a reduced cost so they don’t fall behind in their studies would be a start.
Some might say it’s not USC’s burden to take on. But in such a key transitional moment for the entire California higher education system, it’s undeniably beneficial for all parties involved for USC to step in and be the school innovative enough to imagine an alternative future, and for USC students to be aware of the role they play in the future of higher education in California.
As a private university, we maintain the private autonomy necessary to promote public partnership and nurture inter-university connections.
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish. Her column “Beyond the Classroom” runs Mondays. 
“creating a summer-school program that allows state students to take classes at USC at a reduced cost”  — That is a crazy idea.  Does that means UCLA students can attend USC classes at a cheaper price?  How fair is that ?
^This. We already subsidize the education of UC students through State taxes. Now she wants us to subsidize their education even more by allowing them to take classes at OUR school at a lower rate than WE pay, and have OUR regular tuition increase to cover the cost? How in the hell is that even remotely equitable?
The only obvious antidote for the U of C is to dig deep into its endowment and start spending money to close the fiscal gap. (They have several billions.) Endowments exist ultimately as a reserve to protect the fiscal integrity of the institution.  Now is the time to use endowment funds to support the U of C.  The U of C does not need USC or its advice; rather, it needs the courage of its regents to do what they need to do.  Unfortunately, the regents are not brave but instead timid souls who don’t have the collective strength or leadership to dip into the endowment.  Instead, they believe students should bear the burden of gaining a “prestigious” U of C degree.  But I ask, where is the prestige of the U of C?  Surely it’s not in the oversubscribed classes, the inability to graduate in four years, the alienated hoards who flock to lecture halls, the 40,000 unclaimed degrees from the Berkeley branch alone, the mediocre student services, the unsubstantiated demands for respect when most professors cannot even name, let alone count, their students…. No, I say, USC has no moral or ethical obligation to assist the U of C other than by public example. Let it wither on the vine…
Well Anon it doesn’t help to have a premium Athletics department that pulls in top dollar year after year. Not to mention the endowment a school like USC must have, somewhere in the billions$$$. You sure are running full steam ahead just like Reggie when he got his Heisman swiped. 
Elena UCs will improve once the state of California improves, that’s where the funding is coming from. The projected tuition amount in 2015 is something like $20000 which is absurd but the budget cuts lay with the Gov which continue to flush money. I don’t think with the help of your private institution there will come
 any impact to the problem. It will only create another stream to which the problem will roll onward.
On another note, I can hardly believe USC students feel the impact of our UCs woes. Especially not when your student base comes from some amazingly wealthy Families. I’ve seen the cars your student body drives, that would be a charming house for someone paying for a UC tuition
1) Our endowment is not really that big (about $3 billion, which is the 23rd-highest among U.S. colleges)
2) USC athletics (like most college athletics) are not big moneymakers. Every single sports team at USC loses money except for football, which uses its modest net profit of $8 million to offset the losses of the rest of the athletics department. USC athletics as a whole are barely in the black, and this small profit is a tiny fraction of the school’s total expenses and is too insignificant to have any bearing on the school’s academic success.
3) The majority of students at USC are on need-based financial aid (the percentage is actually higher than that at most UC campuses). USC students are not nearly as rich as you might think.
Cal and UCLA have been tumbling in the rankings over the last 20 years, are capping enrollment, slashing their budgets, and nearly-doubling their tuition.
Over this same period, USC has been skyrocketing up the rankings (44th to 23rd), expanding its programs and enrollment, shattering fundraising records, and offering more financial aid to students than ever before.
I think we’ve been doing just fine at picking up the slack of California higher education. UC dropped the ball – we picked it up and are running full steam ahead.
Socialist garbage.

The set-up: Following two narrow escapes, USC played host to undefeated Syracuse. On the one hand, the Orange, who reportedly left the Big East to join the Atlantic Coast Conference earlier in the day, hoped to spoil a perfect three-game home stand with their impressive passing attack. On the other hand, the Trojans aimed to clean up mistakes from last week and gain momentum before Pac-12 play begins in earnest next week.
The story: On the opening drive, Syracuse used a heavy dosage of passing to march in to the USC red zone. The Orange appeared to move the ball confidently and establish a rhythm, but the Trojan defense stood tall and forced a field goal.
After the first drive, USC took charge by scoring 17 unanswered points to take a 17-3 lead in to the half. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley took some shots down the field, and they paid off immensely. A 20-yard pass to senior tailback Marc Tyler led to a five-yard touchdown pass to senior fullback Rhett Ellison on the first drive, and Barkley found sophomore wide out Robert Woods for a 31-yard score on the second drive.
Early in the second half, Barkley found a wide-open freshman tight end Randall Telfer over the middle for a 44-yard score. The touchdown broke the game open and gave the Trojans a comfortable lead.
As the offense found the end zone, the USC defense held steady. Syracuse failed to run the ball well, accumulating only 73 yards on 21 carries. Quarterback Ryan Nassib completed 25 of his 37 passes, but they never really materialized in to points. Despite a consistent pass rush, USC’s pass defense held its own thanks to good coverage in the secondary by sophomore Nickell Robey and junior safety T.J. McDonald.
Overall, USC soundly beat Syracuse with the final score of 38-17. The Trojans turned in an impressive performance on both sides of the ball and played their most completed contest to date.
“It is really nice to get a win like the old days,” Lane Kiffin said. “We are really pleased to get to 3-0 this week. Our guys fought hard all night for us and I’m really proud of that. We showed a great deal of improvement in all areas of the game.”
Most importantly for USC, they found a way to score in the second half and put the game away, something that was lacking the previous two weeks.
Aerial assault: For the third time in his career, Matt Barkley tied the school record for passing touchdowns with five. The most impressive aspect of the feat: Each touchdown pass went to a difference receiver. On the year, the junior quarterback has completed 80 of his 116 attempts (68.9 percent) for 892 yards, 9 touchdowns, and only one interception. Sophomore sensation Robert Woods led the team with 8 catches and 82 yards. Freshman Marqise Lee was not far behind, reeling in 2 catches for 63 yards.
Running loose: Late in the game, Lane Kiffin called on his group of running backs to carry the ball and run out the clock. With starter Marc Tyler (15 carries for 41 yards) struggling, Kiffin turned to Dillon Baxter and Curtis McNeal. While Baxter looked solid, McNeal shined. He managed 79 yards on 5 carries, including an impressive 43-yard run featuring jukes and broken tackles.
Up next: USC heads to Tempe, Ariz., for a pivotal Pac-12 South game against Arizona State. The Sun Devils are considered one of the favorites to win the division, and the winner will have a huge edge by owning the head-to-head tiebreaker. Arizona State is coming off of a disappointing loss to Illinois.

Holland is to be the third European country to ban the burqa. Following France and Belgium, Holland plans to introduce fines for women wearing burqas in public, on streets, while using public transportation, in schools and in hospitals.
Proponents of such legislation argue that cloth, such as the burqa, that completely or almost entirely cover the face do not fit in public life in a society where people are recognized by their faces, and that the wearing of such cloths goes against principles of equality between men and women. Descriptions of the burqa as imprisonment “behind a mesh,” as French president Nicolas Sarkozy, put it; reflect attitudes of many non-Muslims toward the burqa.
The anti-Muslim undertones of such measures are apparent. However, only a very small proportion of the women living in the Netherlands cover their faces with burquas. Islamic headscarves are an increasingly common sight in public, and are not necessarily targeted by the proposed ban.
The Dutch Equality Commission had previous ruled such a ban was discriminatory.  A Haarlem magistrate, however, soon ruled otherwise, and this decision is now confirmed by The Amsterdam Court.
Certain proponents of free speech believe the banning of the burqa constitutes a form of censorship. They argue those of certain religious beliefs will be not allowed to practice their religion by their dress.
However, those in support of the ban state that the burqa stands in the way of Muslim assimilation into Dutch society. The covering of the face itself is a debatable issue, which many argue is based on no Quranic requirement. Proponents of this view argue that the burqa is a cultural tradition, not a religious one.
Still, many maintain that the attack on the burqa is an attack on Muslim fundamentalism. While the burqa itself in Holland might not be an especially prominent item, nor will the ban necessarily directly affect many people, the principles of taking clear action against it clearly show hostility toward some Muslims.
The burqa will not be banned everywhere. In religious buildings and in certain transit lounges and airports, burqas will be permitted. This way, certain travelers can be exempted from the ban.

Star Wars fans are not happy with many things George Lucas, creator of the franchise, is doing with the universe he created. Just last week, Lucas released the entire Star Wars saga in HD Blu-ray with additional special feature content. This release, however, contains two notable edits that have angered hardcore fans.
Many fans consider the original Star Wars films (Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983)) to be classics, and feel Lucas is corrupting his masterpieces with revisions.
While fans do not typically criticize clean-up type work and enhancements to quality, plot and character changes are definitely noticed. The two edits that have caused the most controversy involve adding Darth Vader’s cry of “no!” to the previously mute scene when the emperor electrocutes Luke, and changes made to the scene in which Han Solo shoots Greedo in the cantina.
The changes might seem minor, but the issue has led to discussion regarding the fans’ role in relation to any production. For this particular incident, the changes themselves are less of the controversy than the fact that the original films are not readily available. How is the fan base, then, or the spectators of a film or other work of art, related to the work itself?
Star Wars in particular has had a long history of conflict between Lucas and fans. The three prequels, Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, were widely criticized by emotionally charged fans when released, largely in relation to how they related to the original trilogy. Star Wars has been a large part of many generations’ childhoods, and is regarded as almost sacred by the most hardcore fans.
Though characters like Darth Vader remain Lucas’ intellectual property to modify as he likes, the emotional attachment of many fans to his saga is undeniable. While Lucas is held in high esteem as Star Wars’ original creator, he is definitely not the only force shaping the face of Star Wars as it is perceived and received today.
Why movies are  edited and re-released?
Money for their pockets! Bottom line.

A USC research team comprising scientists from the Keck School of Medicine and the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine have produced the world’s first high-resolution images of the Alpha 7 receptor.
The α7 is the molecule responsible for transmitting signals between neurons, especially in the regions of the brain considered to be associated with learning and memory. This scientific breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the production of pharmaceuticals used to treat major ailments such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.
Attempts to decipher neuro-receptors have been ongoing for 30 years, without much prior success. Using the image, scientists would now be able to design their medicines specifically to interact with the receptor, instead of the earlier trial-and-error approach.
“A lot of interest in this work will come from pharmaceutical companies,” said Dr. Lin Chen, a professor of biological sciences and chemistry at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, to USCNews. “They really have no clear picture of this. They don’t know how or why [their drugs] work.”
The usual method to study such molecules, which involves growing a large quantity using molecular cloning, had failed to produce enough correctly structured α7 to study. So, Dr. Chen’s collaborator, Dr. Steve Sine from Mayo Clinic, engineered a new molecule sharing about 70 percent of its structure in common with the α7 that reacted to stimuli in the same way that natural α7 does. The engineered molecule was then used to form crystals with receptor protein for structural analysis.
“In a sense, these crystals are probably among the world’s most expensive crystals, certainly more expensive than diamond,” Dr. Chen said. “But considering the rich information we can get from these crystals about human neuronal receptors, and the potential impact on drug development that can benefit human health, they are worth the effort.”
Congratulations on your project.

Despite being on an indefinite hiatus since the summer of 2010, Breaking Benjamin has finally released its heavily-anticipated greatest hits compilation album, Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin, released through Hollywood Records, a Walt Disney-owned record label.
This is the first compilation album from the alternative rock band, following four successful studio albums. Shallow Bay tries to make sure Breaking Benjamin are not forgotten until differences in the band are sorted out — front man Benjamin Burnley fired guitarist Aaron Fink and Bassist Mark Klepaski for remixing tracks without permission.
The album can be obtained as a standard edition with the band’s best songs to date or a two disk deluxe edition with B-sides, acoustic tracks, live songs and remixes. Borrowing songs from all four previous albums in chronological order, the compilation feels balanced. Though this might sound conventional, it allows the listener to experience the band’s progression over the years.
Shallow Bay opens with “Polyamorous,” a catchy pop-metal single from 2002’s breakthrough album Saturate. Burnley’s hard-rock style vocals blend well with the heavy guitar riffs. Of the next two tracks, “Skin” is a passable, generic song and “Medicate,” at its best, showcases the best of Burnley’s voice with a sing-along chorus.
The commercially successful track “So Cold” from 2004’s We Are Not Alone is a relatively softer song with a quiet intro and heavy chorus. Burnley’s vocals clearly stand out on “Sooner or Later,” whereas “Rain” is an unfitting ballad effort with soulful acoustics.
The album gets a much-needed lift with “The Diary of Jane.” The piano intro gives way to a thumping beat with catchy riffs and delightful vocals. The band’s best-known song stands out on the first disk.
“Breath” and “Until the End” don’t help the album with the latter featuring growling vocals and dull lyrics. “I Will Not Bow” which blends the aggression of alternative metal and melodic rhythms is arguably Breaking Benjamin’s best song to date. The infectious hook “I will not bow, I will not break” stays with you long after the song ends.
“Give me a sign” is a consistent vocal effort from Burnley, whereas “Lights Out” is a typical Breaking Benjamin hard rock track. The single from the album, “Blow Me Away,” features guest vocals from lead singer Syd Duran of rock band Valora. The vocal interplay between Burnley and Syd makes for an interesting listen.
The bonus rarities CD features acoustic versions of “Polyamorous”, “I Will Not Bow” and “Lie to Me”. Burnley gets to show his full potential of vocal ability but “Better Days” lacks innovation.
The Japanese B-sides “Ordinary Man” and “Lady Bug” are previously unreleased songs. “Lady Bug” has vile riffs and no continuity, while “Ordinary Man” highlights Breaking Benjamin’s punk influences. The chugging riff on remixed “Water” appeared on the band’s EP.
The Depeche Mode cover “Enjoy the Silence” is worth a listen with its dark and hollow vocals in spite of the discordant electronic effects at the beginning. The cover of Queen’s “Who Wants to Live Forever” is a pleasant acoustic listen.
Although the album has its highs and lows, for the Breaking Benjamin fans Shallow Bay serves as a good addition to their collection. For the first-timers, welcome to Breaking Benjamin.

A team of NASA scientists recently discovered a unique planet in outer space that orbits two different suns. Kepler-16b, named after NASA’s Kepler mission, is located within the western part of the Cynus constellation (more commonly known as the swan).
The planet has garnered instant Star Wars comparisons due to a scene with Luke Skywalker depicting a similar planet. According to astronomers, these “binary stars” are actually estimated to make up half of the stars in our galaxy. However, this is the first planet discovered that passes in front of its parent stars.
Kepler-16b is roughly the size of Saturn, with extremely cold temperatures and severe gravity. Both two suns orbited by the planet are smaller than our own solar system’s sun.
For anyone curious about how long it would take to reach the planet, it’s 200 million light years away from Earth — or the equivalent of 3.5 million years of travel time at the speed of the Voyager space probe.
Wow, very interesting. Are we going to get more info on this?

This week Apple banned from its store the iPhone application Phone Story just three days after its release. The game depicts a cartoon character working through the realistic and often unpleasant processes of creating Apple merchandise, highlighting the uglier side of electronics production.
Players of the app can take of the role of an employee in the oppressive conditions of the Foxconn factory, an Apple partner. In another level, players plan the obsolescence of electronics in the West, an act with negative consequences on the environment. Of course, the cartoon avatar uses an Apple phone to communicate and interact throughout the game.
In Phone Story’s “Suicide” mini game, one plays as a medical employee with a trampoline net attempting to catch staff jumping off the roof. This was to satirize the 14 real-life suicide attempts in Taiwan’s Foxconn in 2010, and three in 2011 thus far.
Molleindustria, the creators of the dark game, explained it as one that attempts to provoke a critical reflection on its own technological platform. In an interview with Gamasutra, Molleindustria’s Paolo Pedercini said, “We don’t want people to stop buying smartphones, but maybe we can make a little contribution in terms of shifting the perception of technological lust from cool to not-that-cool. This happened before with fur coats, diamonds, cigarettes and SUVs — I can’t see why it can’t happen with iPads.
According to Wired.com, Apple removed the game because it violated four rules for iOS app creation, including its depictions of child abuse (code 15.2), objectionable content (16.1) and promises to turn over a portion of the money to charity (21.1 and 21.2).
Though removed from the Apple store, Phone Story can still be purchased for $1 in the Android Market.

Despite the fact that Marina Goldovskaya’s film played to a relatively thin crowd (Maya Angelou’s appearance emptied houses all over campus), “A Bitter Taste of Freedom” left anything but a sour taste in the mouths of audience members.
On Sept. 7 at 7 p.m. in the Ray Stark Family Theater, USC’s School of Cinematic Arts offered its fifth segment of the weekly “Outside the Box Office” program, which showcases foreign, documentary and independent films to students and the public.
Goldovskaya’s addition did not disappoint.
With this extremely intimate and personal film, Goldovskaya, an award-winning Russian filmmaker responsible for 35 pictures, portrays the life of close friend Anna Politkovskaya, who was fatally shot in the entrance to her house in 2006 for her controversial investigative journalism.
“The day she died, her kids came to me and said ‘Will you make a film?’ I said yes,” said Goldovskaya. “But I have to step back a little bit.”
Yet, Goldovskaya does anything but step back in this comfortably raw documentary. How can she, when she has known the subject for 20 years?
“Anna and I were friends,” said Goldovskaya in her director’s statement for the film. “We trusted each other and always had a lot of things to share and discuss. When we met, we couldn’t stop talking, and I could not stop filming. We spoke not only about her work but about everything.”
The entire film is shot home-video style, featuring rough cuts and grainy, shaky cinematography. “A Bitter Taste of Freedom” relies heavily on verbal narration rather than dramatization. There is Anna herself spelling out her motivation for going undercover in dangerous situations to capture stories. There are the family members who recall their personal experiences with Anna and terrorism. Even the director’s voice can be heard over the poignant, piano-laden soundtrack, narrating her relationship with the courageous journalist.
For “A Bitter Taste of Freedom”, Goldovskaya uses a very personal style of filmmaking. She is a one-woman film crew, serving as director, producer, writer and cinematographer, and mostly relying on conversations — not interviews — to tell the story.
“I am alone,” said Goldovskaya in her post-film Q&A. “There is no assistant, no sound person, no gaffer. Nobody but my little camera and I. I am maintaining conversation. That’s why I never had a problem getting a sincere interview. I just walk into the room with my camera already turned on.”
This technique pays off. In the close-ups of Politkovskaya, the camera eagerly displays her wit and charm, painting her as a real person.
“For me I have to fall in love with my character,” said Goldovskaya. “She [Anna] was extremely charismatic. She gave me this wonderful opportunity to enjoy every single minute I was filming her. The way she talks. The way she moves. She was so exciting, so interesting.”
“A Bitter Taste of Freedom”, the follow-up to the 1991 “A Taste of Freedom,” which featured Anna and her husband Sasha Politkovskaya, shows both sides of its subject. There is the serious Anna who is poisoned on a trip to a hostage negotiation and confesses to the camera that she may give up journalism and who suffers the hardships of being a female journalist in censored Russia.
There is also the personal side of Anna who, without the closeness of the film, would have been lost in the fame and renown of her career. In a comic relief scene, Anna plays with her large, loving bloodhound. In one particularly moving scene, Anna directly addresses the camera and explicitly states she wishes her children could be proud of her — to see that her work has its benefits and that she is successful.
She is, in a word, perfectly human.
“For a filmmaker, it’s an ideal life story,” said Goldovskaya. “It’s horrible to say, but this story has courage, life and death, a love story, war, and a dog. All these little things come together, and I try to build them up.”
“A Bitter Taste of Freedom” will be released in theaters in Russia in December with a DVD copy soon to follow.
What an amazing article! Go Carrie!
