The Office of Student Affairs sent emails Monday to students whose permanent addresses indicate their homes might have been affected by Hurricane Irene.
The email reminded students a counseling service is available for all of those who might need emotional support during difficult times, but some students said  as of Monday night they had not received the email as of Monday night.
Joyce Fienman, a senior majoring in history, said she was curious as to why she didn’t receive the email even though she is from Arlington, Mass.
“I would be interested as to what it says,” Fienman said. “[But] since I wasn’t personally affected by the hurricane, I don’t mind that I didn’t receive the email.”
The email encouraged students to get in touch with USC Student Counseling Services if family members were in any way affected by the storm.
“We err on the side of caution,” said Maria Pozo-Humphreys, assistant director of Student Counseling Services. “We always want to be prepared in the event there is some emergency.”
She said USC does not expect much student response.
“As you know, the hurricane did not turn out to be as strong as they thought and as lethal as they thought it might be,” Pozo-Humphreys said. “I’m not hearing a lot of devastating information.”
Sam Silverman, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said he didn’t know a counseling service exists.
“My family was in Long Island and they had to evacuate,” Silverman said. “They were locked in their apartment for six hours. The hurricane definitely affected them.”
Students who received the email said they were grateful for the support it offered. Alex Hofmann, a senior majoring in history and political science, said he and his family were worried about their house in Ocean City, N.J. flooding.
“I thought it was a great thing to offer and everything,” Hofmann said. “I think it would have been really good if something bad had happened.”
The Office of Student Affairs said it periodically sends emails when events that might impact students occur because it wants students to know they offer extra support.
I don’t need counseling but can you get me a line pass for the 90

Cindy Hensley McCain, who received a bachelor’s degree in education and a master’s degree in special education from USC, joined the Board of Councilors for the Rossier School of Education last week.
Learning · Cindy McCain will provide support and advocacy for Rossier. - Daily Trojan file photo
The 20 board members are tasked with providing support, advocacy and advice for the Rossier School of Education.
“The education and experiences I gained at USC Rossier have been invaluable throughout my life,” McCain said in a press release issued last Tuesday. “It is an honor to be able to play a part in leading the school toward its mission of improving education for all children.”
While studying at USC, McCain was involved in pilot programs examining movement therapy, now considered a standard for working with severely disabled children.
“Mrs. McCain has made a career out of doing extraordinary work on behalf of children in need, beginning with her work as a special education teacher and continuing through her philanthropy for children around the world,” said Barbara Goen, assistant dean for communication at the Rossier School of Education.
McCain, who worked with disabled children as a teacher at Agua Fria High School in Arizona, founded the American Voluntary Medical Team, an organization that provided medical assistance worldwide to children in poverty from 1988 to 1995.
“@USCRossier I am honored and proud to be a part of school of ed,” McCain tweeted in response to the press release, which the Rossier School of Education posted on its Twitter account.
As part of the Rossier School of Education’s centennial last February, McCain was honored with the Dean’s Alumni Achievement Award. McCain’s husband, Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), presented the award at the school’s gala.
At that time, the school established the Cindy Hensley McCain Global Educator Fellowship.
The award is granted to “aspiring teachers who will face global challenges in meeting the learning needs of children and youth,” according to the press release.
“We are thrilled to have such a tremendous advocate for education and disadvantaged children join our board,” said Karen Symms Gallagher, dean of the Rossier School of Education, in the press release. “Mrs. McCain will be an important asset to the leadership of our school as we continue to grow and have even greater impact in improving urban education locally, nationally and globally.”
The Board of Councilors officially meets two or three times in the academic year. The next board meeting is scheduled for September. At the meetings, Goen expects McCain will participate in person or via teleconference.
“We will eagerly welcome Mrs. McCain whenever she can be on campus,” Goen said.
McCain also serves on the Board of Trustees for The Hazardous Area Life-Support Organization Trust, a non-profit organization that works to clear landmines, and on the board of the Eastern Congo Initiative. She also travels often with the World Food Programme and Operation Smile.
Not unlike Pat Nixon, Cindy didn’t marry well, but :”Once a Trojan, always a Trojan.”
Kappa or DG?  I can’t decide
OMG!  Theta!  Really?
Interesting no mention of her being Mrs. John McCain anywhere in the article. Maybe she should show some
of this compassion to her husband.
Why, because the accomplishments or experiences of her husband are somehow relevant to her qualifications for a position on this board? What a joke. 
Anyways, read carefully — “McCain’s husband, Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), presented the award at the school’s gala.”

President C. L. Max Nikias knows the challenges that face him in his quest to raise $6 billion in seven years. The economy has entered another downturn, and the size of the university’s goal is unprecedented in higher education. But he’s not worried.
“I feel good about it,” Nikias said Monday, a day after announcing the campaign for the University of Southern California. “I know it’s a lot of work. I know we all have to work very hard for it.”
The ambitious undertaking has been on Nikias’ mind since he was selected to succeed former President Steven B. Sample in the spring of 2010; he has been working for the past year to develop specific goals and to bring in private donations before the campaign’s public launch Sept. 15.
The campaign’s goals are explicit and include improvements to virtually every facet of university life.
The projected $6 billion will be split among four broad purposes: $2 billion for the endowment of faculty and research programs, $1 billion to endow student scholarships, $2 billion for immediate support of academic priorities and $1 billion for support of building projects. If successful, the campaign will more than double the size of USC’s endowment, and USC has hired its first chief investment officer to make sure the endowment is invested in the best possible way.
Specific projects include endowing a graduate fellowship for artists from the Pacific Rim, constructing an interdisciplinary social sciences building, adding more undergraduate and graduate student housing, renovating the University Village, increasing clinical and translational efforts on the Health Sciences Campus and building a new facility for the Marshall School of Business.
The goals were developed by Al Checcio, senior vice president for university advancement, in close conjunction with Provost Elizabeth Garrett, whose office is in the process of developing USC’s new strategic vision, a roadmap for the university’s academic growth, that will be presented to the Board of Trustees this fall.
In the process of developing the strategic vision, the provost’s office solicited advice from all constituents on campus, including students.
Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi said USG was contacted by the provost’s office in the spring and subsequently held a forum to give students the chance to offer suggestions for the strategic plan.
“Students definitely seemed really excited with the direction the university’s headed in terms of just becoming much more of a top-tier university,” Tyagi said.
Students specifically asked for more housing and student scholarships, Tyagi said, both of which are listed as goals for the upcoming capital campaign.
In setting goals, the university also worked with each individual school and unit on campus to help them set their own objectives. The autonomy of the individual schools will be a hallmark of the campaign, Nikias said, and each of the deans will be responsible for meeting their school’s benchmark.
“The deans are very, very important for the success of the campaign. I told the deans that I expect that at least 70, if not 80, percent of their time will have to be devoted to the campaign,” Nikias said.
The schools’ individual goals were decided by determining how much each school realistically needs to support its academic vision and by evaluating the giving power of each school’s alumni base.
“For instance, the Marshall School would have better prospects in many ways because of the nature of the school and the business the alums go into,” Checcio said.
The schools with the highest aspirations are the Keck School of Medicine, which aims to raise $1.5 billion, and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, with a goal of $750 million. Both Keck and USC Dornsife have already received large gifts, including $200 million to name USC Dornsife that was the largest single donation in the university’s history.
Large donations like these are part of the reason Nikias and Checcio aren’t too worried about meeting their lofty goal.
“It helps in so many ways –— it creates a sense of momentum,” Checcio said. “It also serves as an affirmation of the direction and leadership of the institution.”
In large-scale capital campaigns, universities often rely on “mega-gifts,” donations that exceed $25 million, according to Donald Fellows, a fundraising consultant. Typically, Fellows said, 75 to 80 percent of the money raised in large campaigns comes from gifts of $1 million or more.
That could pose a challenge for USC, as people who make large gifts tend to be more cautious when the economy is unstable, Fellows said.
“The challenge may be in the number of those mega-gifts,” he said. “But I’ve got to believe the university knows it has many more out there that will come or they wouldn’t have made such a bold statement on the goal.”
Nikias confirmed there are several gifts currently in the negotiation stage, but he said there will probably not be another major gift announced between now and the kick-off of the campaign.
“Many universities, when they announce campaigns, usually they also announce a large gift, but we already had five big gifts announced. I don’t feel I have to do that,” Nikias said. “I don’t have to do what others are doing. I want to do what is right for USC.”

So much has happened since Matt Barkley first stepped onto USC’s campus years ago, when he was just an 18-year-old with a million-dollar smile and championship promise in tow.
Protecting the ball · USC junior quarterback threw 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 2010. This fall, he will look to improve his touchdown-to-interception ratio for the third consecutive season. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
First came the losses of 2009 — four in a season for the first time since 2001 — as a team in flux tried to live up to impossible expectations spawned by years of NCAA dominance and Rose Bowl victories.
Initially it seemed like a blessing that former USC coach Pete Carroll fully believed in the fresh-faced Barkley to take the reins.
But while it gave Barkley a great opportunity, it quickly became obvious there were too many pieces missing for the team to repeat as Pac-10 champions, leaving the freshman to shoulder much of the blame.
Then came the coaching change: The impossible happened, and Carroll was gone — off to Seattle in a flash.
Barkley, heading into only his second year of college and left alone as starting quarterback, was suddenly the arm, face and life of the Trojans.
But whether it was the quick maturation process he went through his freshman year or the veteran composition he exuded in comparison to newly acquired coach Lane Kiffin, he suddenly seemed fit for the part.
Then, of course, came the sanctions and the ensuing madness. Amidst questions of future recruiting, transfers, lost scholarships and a potential lack of will to play and win, Barkley remained poised to lead USC to victory.
And, considering the disaster that was the 2010 Trojan defense, he did for the most part — that is, until a cringing tackle midway through a Nov. 20 contest at Oregon State left him unable to play. The Trojans went on to lose miserably to the Beavers and then drop a heart-wrencher to intersectional rival Notre Dame a week later, leaving an undesirable taste in everyone’s mouth and a mark on Barkley’s already spotty résumé.
That’s quite a lot for someone to digest before reaching the halfway point of one’s college career.
So as we near the start of the 2011 season and Barkley tries for a third time to lead the Trojans to end zone glory, the same questions surround him since he committed to USC — uncertainties about his talent, leadership and ability to make plays to put the Trojans in a position to win football games.
But while the questions remain unchanged, the answers certainly haven’t.
Barkley might have been the best quarterback in the nation coming out of high school, but none of his hype mattered once he was thrown under center wearing cardinal and gold.
His raw talents let him feel the rush of victory at times, but other times were not enough to bring him desired results. He lacked that elusive mental toughness that only comes with experience.
Many said that for Barkley to become a better player, he needed to first deal with the steep mental and emotional learning curve involved with being a college quarterback.
But with each new development regarding the team in the last two years, that steep learning curve transformed into a Himalayan-sized problem that everyone looked to their beloved quarterback to solve.
Barkley hasn’t been the answer on more than one occasion, but the fact that he has dealt with it all suggests that he might be reaching a breakthrough.
Deserved or not, his legacy is forever tied to the tumultuous past two seasons, and it has steeled him — for as much change that has occurred, he has been the proverbial rock in the depth chart.
The highs and lows of this season won’t be dictated by whether or not he can throw the ball 60 yards, thread the needle to a covered receiver or evade oncoming linemen.
It will come down to Barkley making the right decisions and preventing a youthful team from becoming unmotivated due to a plethora of factors working against them.
And while it has been both literally and figuratively painful for Barkley at times during his short career, it might be for the best — the junior is the right guy to lead this current team because of what he has already gone through.
The man behind center for the season opener this Saturday might look the same, run the same and throw the same as you last remember him.
But a closer examination will reveal that in place of the wide-eyed 18-year old kid from Newport Beach, Calif. is a tough quarterback that, with two years of starting experience, appears more than ready to win.

How could the Notre Dame ..leave ” a mark on Barkley’s already spotty résumé”  ???

In the middle of a team meeting on Aug. 20, USC coach Lane Kiffin paused to scold junior wide receiver Robbie Boyer and sophomore linebacker Will Andrew for dozing off. Kiffin then instructed them to stand against the auditorium wall until further notice.
Stunned, the two walk-ons feared what would come next.

“For some reason, he thought I was asleep,” Andrew said. “He asked me if I was bored. I was really embarrassed. Anyone who knows me knows I wouldn’t be asleep in a meeting.”
That’s when Kiffin could no longer maintain the farce.
“It was pretty crazy,” Boyer said. “He had some choice words for us. Then, towards the end of the meeting, he said that ‘anyone standing in this room right now is on full-scholarship.’ Everyone started cheering for us.”
Exiting high school, Boyer and Andrew were assigned only two stars between them by most recruiting services — both of which belonged to Boyer. On a roster laden with four- and five-star recruits, Boyer and Andrew combined amounted to essentially half of a prototypical USC recruit. Both were tagged as undersized players whose instincts and fundamentals allowed them to perform past their measurable athletic skills. Consequently, most scouts assumed Boyer and Andrew had plateaued.
Boyer, the cousin of junior quarterback Matt Barkley, starred for the storied USC pipeline Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., hauling in 57 receptions for 1,033 yards and 14 touchdowns as a senior in 2007. Possessing a sterling GPA, he drew interest from many universities’ football programs, including Harvard, but ultimately decided to enroll as a preferred walk-on at USC because of his comfort with the university. After redshirting in 2008, he has seen limited action in the last two years and has yet to record a reception.
Andrew, a defensive end at Edison High School in Huntington Beach, Calif., recorded 75 tackles, seven sacks and two fumble recoveries as a 2008 All-Sunset League first-team player, while also posting a strong GPA. Considered undersized and a step slower, he was not on many teams’ radars as a zero-star recruit, but did receive an offer to play at the University of San Diego and invitations to walk on at several Pac-10 universities. Last season, Andrew appeared in three games and registered two assisted tackles against California.
“I wasn’t really heavily recruited, but I always wanted to play college football,” Andrew said. “I looked at my options to see which places I could walk on. The University of San Diego wanted me, but I wasn’t all that interested. I always wanted to go to USC, and I didn’t want to have any regrets about not giving it a shot.”
Though these scholarships were long in the offing, as this past spring Kiffin came to rely on Boyer and Andrew to play meaningful snaps during practice often with and against first-stringers, neither player has the inside track to stardom quite yet.
Their roles have diminished a little this fall as expected, with talented true freshmen arriving on campus and other injured players taking advantage of the summer break to recuperate fully. In addition, both of their scholarships, as with all scholarships, are guaranteed only through this school year and will be reevaluated at the end of the season.
Both players, therefore, are realistic in their expectations for this season in terms of playing time, but also realize the importance of continued optimism and diligence.
“I’m comfortable doing whatever the team needs,” Boyer said. “I know my plays, and I know how to run routes. I’m one of the smarter receivers, I think.”
Andrew shares a similar outlook.
“I’m trying to get in on special teams too, but I’m just working hard to see where I can get in and just staying prepared,” Andrew said.
It has been difficult to ignore either during fall camp. Boyer is slippery, able to elude defenders and reel in tough catches over the middle. Similarly, Andrew appears to command the defense well, doling out coverage assignments with ease.
Very interesting article! I loved the writing style too.

With all of the questions surrounding USC’s season, none has loomed larger than the one regarding the status of its offensive line and supposed lack of continuity.
Three of USC’s five starters from last season either graduated or moved on to the NFL. Of the two who return as starters, only Kalil is playing the same position as last year. But the Orange County native has not bought into the idea that this group of linemen is a work in progress.
“As an offensive line, one of the most important things is having chemistry,” Kalil said. “When you have three starters go, it’s kind of hard to mesh together guys you never played with. I think for us, it was kind of unique for us to come together as fast as we did. I wasn’t expecting that.”
Kalil, along with junior center Khaled Holmes, has had to lead and mentor a young and inexperienced offensive line, as the Trojans’ season opener against Minnesota on Saturday looms ahead. Yet having a select few experienced players such as Kalil and Holmes has allowed the newcomers to grow up quicker than expected.
“[The coaches] are treating us the same,” Kalil said. “We still got a lot of guys that have been here, but the new freshmen that came in, they’ve kind of just meshed in with the group.”
For now, joining Holmes and Kalil on the line are sophomore right tackle Kevin Graf and guards Jeremy Galten and John Martinez, who are a junior and sophomore respectively. The line currently has no senior starters. Other players such as freshmen Marcus Martin and Aundrey Walker have been seeing time in practice.
Martin, a local product of Crenshaw High School, said his road to the top of the depth chart has been more difficult than expected.
“[The learning curve] was a lot bigger than I thought it was coming in,” he said. “I didn’t expect my playbook to be that thick but you adjust. Coming out to this college playing field, you have to adjust and take coaching well. And that’s what I’m going to continue to do.”
Though just a freshman, Martin expresses similar sentiments about the unity of the line.
“[The veteran linemen] all look out for me,” Martin said. “They all have my back. They teach me and we all work well together.”
With the youth and inexperience of the offensive line, even Barkley admits he was initially a little nervous about the line’s prospects.
“We didn’t have any depth,” Barkley said. “[The line] was young. Really only Matt Kalil was the same guy playing the same position as last year. But we’ve come a long way since spring ball to where we are now. We still have some puzzle pieces moving around up front, but I like how they’re coming together.”
Changes along the offensive line are nothing new for Barkley. Including this coming season, he has had at least two different starters at every position along the line since he stepped on campus in 2009.
So what has Barkley done to let his line know it has his trust?
“Well, I always tell them, ‘no one touches No. 7,’” Barkley said with a grin. “And they know that if they give me time, we’ll move the ball … If they get their job done, then we score.”
“The biggest focus is finishing fourth quarters,” Kalil said. “We’re going to get after guys a lot more than we did last year.”
A key reason for that, Kalil insists, is the team’s core of young players.
“You kind of have to be humble,” Kalil said. “Once you come here as a freshman, you know, it starts all over … [the new guys] did a good job of asking us questions, watching film with us. They’re a great group of guys.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated center Khaled Holmes as a senior. Holmes is in fact a redshirt junior.
Hey, even the DT readership is meshing!
Sorry guys, I thought I took care of that. I forgot he was a redshirt. My mistake.
@Steve B. — “One Sentence has Khaled Homes a senior **then** there are no senior starters on the offensive line in a later sentence”… just saying
^ Hahahahah
You obviously do not proof read your article. One sentence has Khaled Holmes a senior than there are no senior starters on the offensive line in a later sentence. Holmes is not a senior in athletic eligibility.

Instead of selling games as a pay once, play forever-type model, many online games are being offered as free-to-play, with additional charges for extra features. One such highly successful models is League of Legends.
Just last year, Brandon Beck, co-founder of the company that makes League of Legends, visited USC to speak at the 2011 Marshall commencement ceremony. And indeed, his business sense is admirable.
Although paying $60 to begin playing a game like Starcraft II might initially seem steep, players that pay once for a game often end up paying far less for their entertainment than those that begin playing “Ffree to play” games.
The beauty of this business strategy is that it is a win-win situation for both gamers and game producers. For game producers, continued income doesn’t hinge on the release of a single game or expansion, as games are “alive” and continue to bring income. For players, games have the potential to be far better maintained and improved with new content as developers are encouraged to continue to create new content and keep their games running smoothly so players will pay for additional features.
Accessibility is a large reason for the success of many of these games. This strategy has been especially successful with Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games. Rather than selling on spectacular graphics or excellent story lines, MMORPG games often win players by lighter system requirements and addicting game play. Players can often access such games for free and are encouraged to player more hours to become stronger. Paying real money can supplement in-game power.
A well-known example is Maple Story, a Korean-made 2d side scrolling game, first popularized throughout Asia. In this game, players can pay real money to gain more powerful items and skills, have fun accessories such as “pets,” or even get “married.” The continued addition of new content, including new characters and classes for players to try when they get tired of their old ones has allowed Maple Story to stay popular with many from the “original” generation of players, as well as attracted many new players since.
Free-to-play games seem to promise a continuing game experience, that doesn’t stop after “buying a box.” Keeping both players and businesses happy, it seems this strategy for online entertainment is here to stay.
i want to play free online game,so give me chance.

College students enjoy having a multitude of options when it comes to dining, but it is can be hard to find affordable dining ins Los Angeles. Venues have to meet the criteria of being close by, inexpensive expensive and worth the money in the deliciousness meter.
Fortunately, there are many options only a few minutes away from USC. One of the most popular places is all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue restaurant Sanya, located on Olympic Boulevard in Koreatown that will easily fill college student’s stomach for $10.
Sanya might seem oddly situated, with a small parking lot and strange yellow decorations, but do not be fooled by the appearance.
Sanya provides an unlimited number of side dishes ranging from traditional kimchi to mashed potatoes. The best part is the rice paper used to wrap beef and salad in. The paper will run out fast, because it is more creative and scrumptious than eating beef with traditional rice, which is also unlimited.
$9.99 will provide at least five different meats to choose from, such as everyone’s favorite bulgogi (marinated beef), beef brisket, pork belly, marinated pork and marinated chicken. $16.99 will offer more adventurous meats, such as beef tongue, and more marinated options, such as spicy marinated pork and intestine.
The meat is delicious considering its economic price. The bulgogi is tender, marinated with the right combination of sweet and salty. Even the chicken was soft, and not stringy like some other Korean barbecue restaurants.
The service is excellent. Most of the waiters were attentive to the customers, and once the plate of meats were done cooking, they came to ask us if we wanted more. The waiters also frequently came to change the grill so the remnants of the marinated sauce would not burn onto the next meat being grilled. Remember to not be shy to ask for more side dishes or more meats.
I would give Sanya a rating of 7 out 10. It is affordable and delicious, perfect for college students!

Have you ever visited a gym and seen the people benching pounds and pounds of weights, straining with each step until their muscles were so pumped up they looked like balloons? Have you ever seen someone finish a workout and gulp down ounces of a muscle-building supplement drink? Has it ever made you want to start putting on muscle?
It might not have, but despite the hyper-masculinity and Schwarzenegger-esque bodies found in the weight lifting world, working out to build muscle is one of the smartest things one can do to develop a healthy body and lifestyle.
But why build muscle if the goal isn’t to look big and bulky? Having more than just the base level of muscle mass helps the body perform tasks easier. And having more muscle will help make the body stronger and more practical.
The idea is to develop muscle strength, not muscle mass. Though it might be a goal for some, looking like the Incredible Hulk is too extreme and unnecessary for a healthy life. So how, then, does one develop strength if not trying to “get swole?”
Weight lifting is the answer, but not in the way most people might expect.
There is a common adage that “low reps, high weights” equals muscle gain, and “high reps, low weights” results in toning existing muscle. Both might be wrong.
If a few repetitions — around four to six of a heavy weight — are done so the body does not collapse on the last extension, muscle is pushed to new limits and strengthened as a result.
The idea of training to failure —  that is, pushing the body to the point of near injury — is not only foolish but it also defeats the purpose of muscle building. If the goal is to increase the resources the body has to move, how does injuring it help? Muscle hypertrophy works by stimulating the cells, not by physically damaging them.
Don’t think this will work?
From personal experience, starting as a 140-pound weakling, it can be done.
What exercises to do are up to the exerciser; everyone has different physical goals. One workout that worked for me was boxing with some dumbbells. It is a bit violent, yes, but effective.
One suggestion for the gym crowd, since the idea is again to get stronger and leaner, is to embrace circuit training — a workout strategy based on keeping the body constantly moving and active, burning fat as the exercises continue.
One circuit involves doing an upper body exercise, followed by a core-focused exercise like sit-ups or crunches and then a lower body one, all without stopping in between.
Compound exercises, such as squatting with a barbell and then lifting it up overhead, work multiple muscle groups at once, which is better for the overall body than isolated exercises.
But with circuit training, because of the continuous motion, a very similar effect is given with more overall muscle engagement.
What about nutrition? It might seem easy and smart to down a pre-made, chemical-laden drink designed to fuel muscle growth.
But these kinds of supplements are just that: chemical-laden. Stick to natural foods high in protein and nutrients to fuel the body. Lean poultry, legumes (lentils are particularly good) and lots of leafy greens (such as spinach, which is a nutrient-dense vegetable) are perfect.
The body needs higher protein levels to fuel muscle growth, so stick to ones low in fat.
Want a muscle-building snack?
Cottage cheese and peanut butter is a cheap, surprisingly tasty meal that is packed with protein and low in negative effects.
If you must use supplements, go for ones that focus on nutrition, not getting “pumped up” or anything of that nature. A good rule of thumb: The less ingredients in something, the better.
The right exercises, with the right diet, can result in a sturdier frame and a stronger body. Building muscle is not hard and it does not mean diving head first into nonstop iron pumping and supplement drinking. Muscle building is only intimidating if you let it be.
 
Nicholas Slayton is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism.  His column “Way of the Body” runs Tuesdays.
WHY YOU RUNNING FROM OUR FIGHT LITTLE MAN? I GOT MORE MUSCLE MASS IN ONE FINGER THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR WHOLE STICK BODY. HOW’S THAT FOR CONVENIENCE? LET’S FIND OUT HOW FIT YOU REALLY ARE SLAYTON. ANY TIME, ANY PLACE, NO MERCY.
This article while attempting to offer good advice is filled with inaccuracies and completely misguided “facts.”  For example “Muscle hypertrophy works by stimulating the cells, not by physically damaging them” is completely false.  The goal of weight lifting is to damage the muscle cells and it is through this that z-line streaming occurs which causes the body to rebuild the damaged sarcomere and muscle cell into a better, stronger, and more efficient structure.  
Next, while a minor point, I feel it is still important.  The article defines compound exercises by providing the example of, “squatting with a barbell and then lifting it up overhead.”   This makes it appear that the author’s definition is combining two exercises, while the actual term “compound exercise” is traditionally defined as “multi-joint movements that rely on the coordinated actions of several muscle groups to move two or more joints through a range of motion.” This would include basic exercises as a squat, a bench press, or a dead lift.
The author is also using the idea of compound exercises as a way to build functional strength and to become more “lean” and burn fat.  However, it has been repeatedly shown that compound exercises while providing a great way to build strength also tend to increase muscle mass much more than isolation exercises.
The author suggests that for nutrition, “The body needs higher protein levels to fuel muscle growth, so stick to ones low in fat.”  However, there has been a large variety of scientific articles that show the importance of essential fats within ones diet especially when becoming involved within weightlifting.  Fat within diet has been shown to be very important and its effects include: enhancing stamina, increasing muscular development, increase recovery speed, and improve cardiovascular function.  Especially in males while weightlifting having a prevalence of fats within the diet is extremely important as it is linked to testosterone production, which will greatly improve ones workout experience and results.
Finally, right after the author says that one should stick to high protein/low fat foods he suggests cottage cheese and peanut butter.  While both of these are healthy, they are also both in general high in fat content.  While one can get a low fat cottage cheese, peanut butter generally has almost twice as much fat content as protein, and that is just from a mass standpoint.  In general it has between 4 and 5 times more caloric content than protein.
While this comment has been rather long winded I do believe that as a representation of our school the daily trojan should uphold a higher standard of research and writing and not simply print things without basic fact checking.  The author also appears to not have a very good base in nutrition, kinesiology, or training and should do much more personal research before writing articles that the entire campus has access to.

What is beauty? Who defines it? How has it evolved? These are a few of the many questions “Beauty Culture” explores in the latest exhibit at the Annenberg Space for Photography.
Diva · Toddlers in tiaras were just one part of the intriguing exhibit.
Running through Nov. 27, “Beauty Culture” proves the furthest thing from superficial. With a subject matter as broad as beauty, the show could have easily faltered;  “Beauty Culture,” however , proves to be thought provoking and innovative with its interesting subject matter, the complexity of its intimate look into the definition of beauty and audience interactivity.
Many of the images are particularly shocking. When one thinks of beauty, the end result tends to come to mind, but there’s an entire process that is often overlooked.
“Beauty Culture” explores this process, bringing a new understanding to the efforts to feel beautiful or meet what others perceive beauty to be. Specifically, the show features a bountiful amount of images of facemasks, electric treatments, hair curlers and botox — just to name a few.
The exhibit upstages itself with something even more terrifying — toddlers in tiaras. Susan Anderson’s portrait of a four-year-old pageant queen, completely made-up with glittery pink ruffles, wildly curly hair that likely required enough hairspray to be a major contributing factor to global warming and of course more makeup than any average girl would wear in her lifetime, truly makes a statement. It forces the viewer to contemplate the ridiculously high standards of beauty and how these in turn have affected our youth.
Leonard Nimoy’s “Full Body Project” is a head turner as well. He juxtaposes two images with the exact same composition and similar subjects, but there’s a catch — the subjects on the left are supermodels such as Naomi Campbell and Cindi Crawford, while the subjects on the right look similar to the models but are instead full-figured.
It’s one thing to see magazines with plus-size models, but to directly compare them with supermodels forces the viewer to question why one is considered far superior to the other, and in turn challenges the superficiality of American values.
“Beauty Culture” continues with juxtapositions by comparing old ideals of beauty to more contemporary standards. This transition was demonstrated in the “Dreams on Paper: The Pinup Girl” portion of the exhibit in which the iconic poster of Farah Fawcett, in her classic red bathing suit matched against the infamous burlesque dancer, Dita Von Teese, posing almost entirely nude.
The exhibit dedicates itself to one iconic beauty in particular, giving her an entire section all to herself. You probably guessed it — “The Marilyn Syndrome.” Plastered on the wall are Gloria Steinhem’s exquisitely accurate words: “The woman who died too soon became the woman who will not die,” emphasizing the long-lasting effects certain beauties can have.
This segment features a collection of photos of both the idol herself and imitations from Lindsay Lohan to Anna Nicole Smith. “The Marilyn Syndrome” proposes that even though our ideals of beauty are constantly changing, some perceptions remain the same.
The exhibit includes a thirty minute documentary with commentary from Crystal Renn, a model who has seen both the plus-size and dangerously thin sides of the business, senior citizen beauty pageant queens, female body builders and many more to offer examples of beauty from all walks of life.
There’s also an interactive, touch-screen table where viewers can select and enlarge images from the likes of Tyen’s Dior Beauty campaigns, which are exquisitely enhanced by CGI, intriguing viewers with its detailed artistry and futuristic take on what it is to be beautiful.
If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then why would these various beauty treatments and ridiculous standards exist in the first place?
“Beauty Culture” brings to light to an issue we all know exists but passively accept, forcing the viewer to pause and take an in-depth look at an important issue our society grapples with.

If it had been opened by any other young, ambitious chef, ink.sack (sic) probably would not have generated nearly as much attention as it did.
Design by Deborah Ho | Daily Trojan
The little take-out sandwich shack with a low-key hole-in-the-wall feel on Melrose Avenue is hardly a neighborhood secret. Ever since word got out that Top Chef season six winner Michael Voltaggio would be opening a sit-down restaurant called ink. on Melrose Avenue, the Los Angeles culinary world has been abuzz with anticipation; however, the buzz is unwarranted. ink.sack falls short of a true Top Chef experience.  The food, albeit tasty, is not worthy of the buzz and cult following it has generated.
ink.sack is a sneak preview of ink. — located just a few steps away from Voltaggio’s restaurant — which is set to open sometime in September. ink.sack, a prototype for Voltaggio’s future culinary ventures.
It has been more than a week since ink.sack opened and the line out the door has yet to dwindle. Voltaggio can be seen popping out of the kitchen from time to time, directing his staff, rapidly packing up sandwiches or, if you’re lucky, serving you food himself.
The interior is as dark and sketchy as a back alley, with splotches of random decor (a Mickey Mouse sandwich press) and a slinky black chain wall that separates kitchen from counter.
The menu, scrawled in colored chalk on a huge blackboard, tries to be fresh and innovative; items from sandwiches down to desserts are a blend of the classic and the gourmet. The tired turkey sandwich, for example, is now maple pepper turkey — a three-inch turkey sub with Camembert cheese, arugula and sweet mortada, which is a compote of sorts made from candied fruits and maple syrup.
The classic Reuben is transformed into something more adventurous with slices of beef tongue instead of the traditional corned beef and is paired with mild Appenzaller cheese, though the other two ingredients, sauerkraut and Russian dressing, remain traditional. The beef tongue is tender enough, but for someone who has never had tongue, the striped, bumpy, offal texture might be disconcerting.
A better choice is the spicy tuna sandwich, an Asian remix of tuna salad and the lobster roll. Fresh chunks of miso-cured albacore tuna are generously mixed with sriracha mayonnaise and topped with slivers of pickles and toasted nori strips before they are squeezed into the bread.
Another pleasing option is the Banh Mi, a Vietnamese-influenced sandwich with a Latino twist. Instead of Vietnamese grilled pork, the sandwich is stuffed with slivers of double-layered pork cheeks (meat and gelatin) that are paired with crunchy chicharrones and refreshing pickled carrots, onions and jalapeño. The pork cheeks are tender and chewy, similar to pork belly.
The bread used for all of the sandwiches is the same, crusty French bread; though the bread is good — albeit a bit too thick — the redundancy of an ingredient that makes up half the sandwich can get boring.
The “snack” menu isn’t too exciting, either.
The pork rinds, though well seasoned and enjoyable, are hardly worth the $3 they cost. The rinds didn’t taste much different than the 99-cent package you can get at a local Latino grocery store.
The street fruit is a premade, vacuum-packed plastic bag of chopped pineapple, jicama, mango and melon marinated in a chile and lemon dressing. Though the zing and tang from the chile powder and lemon juice are pleasant, this little bag is also hardly worth the $3 — considering you can get a big bag of the same thing for less from the Mexican fruit carts that dot Los Angeles’ streets.
Dessert is limited to two cookies: Mexican chocolate chip or peanut butter and sea salt. They are good, but unspectacular; the “Mexican” part really just means a hint of cinnamon-like spice, and the latter is very much like your regular peanut butter cookie — though the sprinkle of sea salt in the batter makes for a lovely sweet and savory contrast.
The sandwiches range from $4 to $6, but don’t be fooled: You need to order at least two to be satisfied. Add to that a side, a drink and a dessert, and you’re looking at a take-out meal costing over $20 — a hefty price for a place that has no where to sit.
However, as somewhat of a plus, the sandwiches are wrapped tightly with paper and then packed into a paper lunch bag with your name on it, just the way your mom might have done for your school lunch.
Perhaps it’s because the restaurant is still in its grand opening stage, but ink.sack falls just short of delivering. Nothing is truly bad about its food, but nothing is truly great, either.

After a busy afternoon of shopping on Melrose Avenue, my mother and I came across Crown of India, quite unexpectedly. From past experiences of eating Indian food in my hometown, New York City, it seems to be a cuisine that either induces stomachaches or satisfies all the right cravings. Crown of India is the latter.
We started with the vegetable samosas, which were perfectly fried and not greasy at all. This surprised me, seeing as I’ve always had to blot the grease off of my samosas in the past (I’ve been told that when something is fried right, there is hardly any left over grease).
On the menu there are various kinds of lamb, chicken, tofu and seafood; my mother and I chose the chicken tikka masala. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and I could even taste the bits of char underneath the tomato and cream sauce. We also ordered the fluffy naan bread and the bhindi combination dish, a mix of okra, lentils, saag paneer (creamy spinach with cubes of cheese) and rice.
Everything was delicious, but I would have to say the dessert was my favorite. We ordered the kulfi, a homemade ice cream with pistachios. The texture is unlike American ice cream or even Italian gelato. The kulfi was thick and almost chalky, not creamy. Though the description might seem off-putting, it’s actually delicious. Everyone who enjoys Indian cuisine should try it.
Crown of India is a hidden jewel with great food and reasonable prices, and even if the exterior of the restaurant is not so glamorous, what awaits inside is truly worth it.

USC’s nickname, “University of Summer Construction,” bears a great deal of truth. Distinguishing our school as a place of summer construction is not necessarily a bad thing. We should recognize USC as a place of transformation in which students play an important role in a university driven by a desire for progress.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
What we make our school look like physically reflects the character of the students.
For many USC students, construction on campus is just plain irritating and represents something that isn’t appreciated during their undergraduate stay at USC.
Whether we like it or not, construction reflects the changing face of USC.
While the administration is in charge of changes to the university, students play an essential role in defining the university by their actions.
For starters, students play a vital part in contributing to the aesthetic integrity of the school. Sometimes, however, they don’t respect the campus.
Students or even guests come onto campus to vandalize USC’s campus with graffiti, such as last year’s Buddha mural in the New/North stairwell.
This need for self-expression could be channeled into a positive experience that allows the student body’s voice to shine.
USC should recognize the need for self-expression causes these acts of vandalism and then we should respond appropriately.
Last fall, the university did this by temporarily making a public-forum graffiti wall in front of the VonKleinSmid Center for all students to freely express themselves. But this setup was only temporary.
There are more permanent setups elsewhere. While visiting California State University, Long Beach two summers ago, I came across an interesting response to graffiti in the restrooms.
Rather than continuing to fight the damages done, the university installed chalkboards in each of the restroom stalls as well as the sink area to encourage students to artistically express themselves in a non-destructive manner.
USC should not just be a place of progressive ideas, but also a place of progressive solutions. Addressing vandalism will not only reflect positively on the physical makeup of the school, but will also make students proud to be part of a uniquely forward-thinking school.
The importance of recognizing USC as an almost living entity is to recognize that what we put into it is what comes out. The current generation of USC students is  guiding USC to mature into the entity that will nurture each successive generation.
With last Wednesday’s involvement fair, USC had the opportunity to display many facets of tremendous diversity in its student body. The clubs reflected a taste of our university.
Before proclaiming “Fight on!” each one of us needs to have at least some sort of direction in which we wish to move.

Congress dealt with many responsibilities this summer, but the debate around resolving the debt ceiling arguably emerged as the top agenda item.
President Ronald Reagan elevated the debt ceiling 18 times during his administration, sharing that Congress generally treats this process as a formality. Still, if Congress hadn’t successfully done this each time, the United States would have defaulted and not paid off its foreign loans.
Had Congress not worked together to resolve that crisis, the implications would have been devastating.
It’s time for partisan politics to end to have a successful new year.
The fact that Congress could not cooperate on this important task exposed one glaring flaw about this Congress: It stands so divided that it is virtually dysfunctional, and with summer recess officially ending Sept. 6, one cannot help but wonder if this dysfunctionality will carry over to another year.
The deficit issue is looming with Congress set to debate which programs to cut under the new budgetary terms. If the leaders of our country do not let bipartisanship, mutual respect and cooperation prevail, we might dip into even more of a political and economic crisis.
With conservatives and liberals and other factions in between, settling this issue became nearly impossible.
For instance, democrats notably pushed to preserve social welfare while republicans staunchly criticized tax hikes. With frustrated representatives, senators and executive officials walking away from the table at crucial moments, Congress barely met the Aug. 2 deadline to raise the debt ceiling. We were, as White House Press Secretary Jay Carney claimed, “playing chicken with our economy.”
The gridlock negatively impacted both the domestic and global economies.
First, the credit rating company Standard and Poor downgraded the United States’ standing from AAA to AA+. Next, more European markets began plummeting. Then, to top it all off, the stock markets dropped over 1,000 points.
Other factors could have contributed to this instability, but it was not a complete coincidence that these events occurred in proximity to the debt ceiling crisis.
Though Congress knew hesitating to lift the debt ceiling could generate debilitating consequences, it couldn’t act efficiently. It could have negotiated a deal substantially superior to the 11th hour to avert this default.
This happened because several members seemed more invested in ensuring they got exactly what they wanted and refused to compromise.
They acted out of personal interests to support their political party and constituents rather than their country. They didn’t consider which policy was substantively best for American citizens overall. With our economy hanging on by a thread, and presidential primaries on the way, they cannot afford to take these missteps in the coming political year.
Those members should have realized that if the country loses, everyone inevitably loses — everyone becomes affected by how the nation improves or devolves.
The various other problems the United States faces today remain monumental and require further cooperative efforts. They span national security, economic and environmental concerns. If the government continues on this splintered path, the country might risk experiencing worse downfalls.
The 2010 BP oil spill irreversibly destroyed thousands of lives and crippled the regional environment and economy.
This catastrophe demanded a collaborative approach mobilized by democrats and republicans; these bipartisan coalitions have assisted the victims significantly. This proved if Congress worked together it could rectify even the worst situations.
Policymakers need to cast their disagreements aside and create a common disposition.
The public elected them to operate as the country’s leaders and their primary job is to implement the policies most beneficial to the American people.
A strong leader isn’t necessarily someone who holds unwavering ideological positions to protect his or her respective constituencies. Sometimes it’s about committing to the difficult, unpopular decisions that might receive backlash and facing the opposition with courage and conviction.
We are all Americans. We are united by this fact and we should all be playing for the same team. This means prioritizing country over personal interest.

You know what does get you somewhere? Making the exact same comment four different times on an internet article. You’re trolling the online opinion page of a student newspaper. Your life must be awesome.
Wow, really insightful. I totally agree with you! Politicians should put partisan politics aside to make good decisions.
This belongs in The Onion
Haha agreed.  God you would think the Daily Trojan could find better writers.
“Policymakers need to cast their disagreements aside and create a common disposition.
The public elected them to operate as the country’s leaders and their primary job is to implement the policies most beneficial to the American people.”
REAL deep substance! “Partisanship makes U.S. Congress dysfunctional” thats literally all this article says. 
An article that tells ppl what they already know. great job DT
I don’t know who Matt is but he’s obviously part of the problem that the writer is taking a stand against. Narrow minded people who only take time to criticize others without forwarding constructive ideas have no more place on the internet than they do in Congress. An article that uses historical examples and allusions to forward a particular argument is a lot more than an FYI Matthew.
saying partisanship is bad is like saying war is bad. the article doesn’t get anyone anywhere.

Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan formally resigned last Friday after considerable criticism on his policies dealing with the March 11 tsunami and the subsequent crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.
Kan resigned under the condition that parliament approved two pieces of legislation: the deficit-financing bond bill and the new energy promotion bill. Both were passed the day Kan resigned.
Kan’s resignation, however, still leaves Japan in a dire situation, both politically and economically. On Monday, Japan’s leading party is to choose a new prime minister. No single candidate clearly owns the public’s support.
Japan’s next leader will inherit all of the nation’s existing problems, as well as face any new issues that arise. Problems plaguing Japan’s recovery include nuclear clean up, economic recession, the surging yen, increased debt and a shrinking population.
Last Thursday’s auction of 20-year Japanese government bonds assuaged some fiscal fears regarding Japan’s recovery, as JGBs (Japanese Government Bond) remain in demand from many investors,  despite the large degree of fiscal uncertainty of Japan’s financial future.
Still, many remain uncertain about Japan’s future, and act conservatively to protect themselves rather than stimulate Japan’s economy.
Faced by lower demand, falling consumer prices have proved to be a problem for Japanese policy makers. Though not a new problem, decreased consumer demand has not aided in Japan’s recovery.
Many investors have seen recent economic problems as an emphasis on the importance of diversifying assets. In response, some investors have turned to buying gold or other precious metals, which are seen as a sort of stable medium relative to the fluctuating yen. Others have began to increase foreign investments, using low Japanese interest rates to borrow Yen for high-yielding overseas investments.
Japan’s future is not clear. However, what is clear that with the number of issues Japan’s new prime minister must face, especially economic issues, that it will take not just the effort and wisdom of an individual, but the cooperation and understanding of many to fix Japan’s current situation.

From 2006 to 2009, the Trojans’ defensive third down conversion rate ranked among the best nationally, regularly stifling opposing offenses on third downs. That success, however, ended in 2010, as USC allowed its opponents to convert on third down more than 43 percent of the time.
USC’s Opponent Third Down Conversion Rate:
2010: 43.82 percent
2009: 37.76 percent
2008: 27.57 percent
2007: 31.00 percent
2006: 38.74 percent
USC coach Lane Kiffin and the coaching staff often attributed the decline to depth, noting that USC did not carry the maximum number of scholarship players (85) due to NCAA sanctions in 2010 that allowed juniors and seniors to transfer without the penalty of sitting out a year.
In the spring, USC assistant head coach Monte Kiffin lamented that the defense thought too much instead of simply reacting. As a result, the Trojans have “simplified” their defense this fall, according to Kiffin.
After its worst defensive season statistically since 1955, USC remains optimistic it can improve in this regard, something that plagued it in close losses to Washington, Stanford and Notre Dame last season.

It’s barely a week into the fall semester, yet the university is already getting people excited for this year. On August 22, the school Twitter account (@USCedu) posted the question, “First week! #uscclass to tell us about the class you’re most excited about. Follow the hashtag & get recs from your fellow students.”
Dozens of USC students — past and present — responded with their most anticipated classes for this semester and their favorite classes overall. Many reference specific professors or topics rather than actual class numbers, allowing browsers of the responses (available by clicking on the hashtag #uscclass on Twitter) to learn more about which professors are best at what they do — or at least the most enjoyable.
With recommendations ranging from Professor Bowlt’s Modern Russian Art seminar, offered through Thematic Option, to graduate classes in biomedical engineering and communication management, USC’s students and alumni are certainly not shy about voicing their opinions.
CTCS190, Introduction to Cinema with Drew Casper, ranks high on the list. One user posted, “…’Intro. to Cinema’ taught by legendary Dr. Drew Casper changed the way I look at film forever.” Other USC departments, such as the School of Social Work and the Admissions Office, also picked up on the Twitter trend and tweeted similar questions to their followers.
Through Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites, the school and its various departments can get important information out to almost the entire student body in a matter of hours — from DPS crime alerts and necessary information to the more frivolous Twitter questions.
This particular story was posted as a round-up on Storify, a social media website that allows users to post their own news topics to their various followers through Twitter, photos, and videos. The full Storify round-up can be found here.

The Obama administration has the chance to claim a much-needed victory in the Middle East, where Libyan rebels were finally able to take control over their capital city of Tripoli.
Even though former Libyan dictator Qaddafi is still thought to be at large, the combined efforts of the NATO coalitions’ air attacks seem to have defeated Qaddafi’s stronghold as well as protected the nation’s civilians.
President Obama hoped to leverage these efforts to form the basic tenets of his military doctrine during his speech at George Washington University on March 28: The United States has the responsibility to intervene when it predicts an oncoming genocide, such as in the Libyan city of Benghazi, but in such cases where the safety of Americans is not at risk, the United States will only act if it is acting in accordance with allies.
The Libyan engagement, in which U.S. air support and intelligence closely collaborated with French, British and Arab forces, was a perfect example of these principles in practice.
This U.S. military victory comes at a time when Obama’s Middle East doctrine is being criticized for over-involvement; at the same time, analysts wonder if this recipe for success can be applied to other tumultuous hotspots such as the conflict in Syria.
But the situation in Syria has many key differences from Libya’s conflict. For one, there is no domestic or international agreement on how exactly to deal with the conflict in Syria; the opposition there doesn’t have any specific territory goals or desired land.
Additionally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has numerous allies in the region such as Hamas and Hezbollah that could prove hostile in the event of a NATO intervention. Finally, there is very little consensus regarding whether or not Syria’s people would actually be better off if Assad was overthrown; the last thing in America’s interests would be if Syria imploded into domestic violence like Iraq did after Saddam Hussein’s arrest.

Our Idiot Brother tells the story of Ned (Paul Rudd), an idealistic man-child of a farmer who, after being duped into selling marijuana to the police, is sent to prison. Upon his release, he finds his girlfriend has dumped him, thrown him out of his house and even took his one true love: his dog, Willie Nelson.
With nowhere else to go, Ned is forced to move back in with his eccentric family. While initially happy to have their brother back, Ned’s sisters (played by Elizebeth Banks, Zoey Deschanel and Emily Mortimer) soon find out their brother’s fun-loving, idealistic antics have the tendency to bring out the worst in people.
It takes none other than Paul Rudd and his goofy Pearl Jam-esque beard, to truly show the audience just how corrupt and mean adults can sometimes be.
Our Idiot Brother can only be described as a comedy in the most generic sense of the word. A more appropriate genre definition, however, would be trendy. Although there were plenty of jokes and funny bits sprinkled into the film, for the most part, every punch line came off as being just a bit too modish and cool.
With Judd Apatow as the leader of this modern trend of comedy, Rudd and other former Apatow collaborators have successfully branched off and propagated the comedy world with this new brand of pop-culture coveting, goof-ball sympathizing, pot-smoking characters and story arches.
Our Idiot Brother is, in essence, a very hip and current movie that fits perfectly with this new mold of Apatow comedy. Even the situations and character traits dealt with in the movie concern hot-topic and artsy characteristics.
For example, it features Zoey Deschenel, who has become somewhat of an indie queen in recent years, as an aspiring stand-up comedian in a lesbian partnership with Rashida Jones, who has created a cult following of her own with her role on ‘Parks and Recreation.’
Both the actors and their relationship prove to be just a bit too socially self-reflexive. It is as if director Jesse Peretz knows he is making a socially-relevant comedy featuring some of the trendiest comedians in the field, and he want to make sure the audience knows it by hammering home the notion with every culturally critical joke.
At its core, however, Our Idiot Brother does offer the audience a positive message. Sometimes adults really do get caught up with their own successes that they occasionally do not look out for the people that truly matter in their lives.
Rudd successfully creates a persona that at once comes off as being ‘idiotic’ (for lack of a better word), but also knowledgeable and wise. He, in the end, is able to bring salvation to his dysfunctional family. His at-first empty minded yet resonant remarks really do leave the audience smiling at the end of the film. It is just unfortunate that the character has to make such unintentionally philosophical observations while wearing a designer sweater, skinny jeans and plastic clogs.

MTV has been criticized for its lack of actual music programming these days. However, the music was spot-on for the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.
Lady Gaga (or Mister Gaga, to be precise) opened the show with “You & I,” dolled out in drag and backed by an ensemble of greasers. Her vocals are so strong and her interpretations so intriguing that it is actually hard to hate on her. Or him.
Kanye and Jay-Z performed a fiery performance of “Otis,” complete with flames, fireworks and one gigantic American flag. Their rhymes were tight and delivered with gusto.
Adele performed her new radio single “Someone Like You.” No gimmicks; simply Adele and a piano. Her voice was flawless, her runs pitch-perfect. 21 has offered some of the best music of the year, and Adele might have given the best performance of the night.
Young the Giant gave a surprisingly refreshing performance nearing the end of the show. The group’s alternative rock stylings were standout against the pop feel of the night, and they made a fantastic first impression for millions of viewers who are most likely unfamiliar with them. If only all bands of this caliber and genre could get airtime on something so mainstream as the VMAs … but then again, if the Pitbulls, Beyonces and Lady Gagas were absent, most of the audience likely would be too.
To close out the night and launch the sale of his new album, Lil Wayne took to the VMA stage to teach millions of viewers “How to Love.” Its hard to tell what was more noticeable: the auto-tune on Weezy’s mic or the diamonds gleaming in his mouth. He launched into a new tune from Tha Carter IV, and it surely would have been a great performance if there had been no censoring. But alas, what was heard of Weezy was minimal.
Other performance highlights include Jessie J, Pitbull, Neyo and Nayer on “Give Me Everything,” Bruno Mars’ Amy Whinehouse tribute, Chris Brown’s airborne dance spectacle and Beyonce’s Motown-inspired “Love on Top”— complete with the triumphant announcement of a baby bump!
Tyler, the Creator, took home the prestigious Best New Artist , while Moonman and the top-nominated Katy Perry shot off with Video of the Year for “Firework.”
Its obvious the VMAs are a mainstream product of pop commercialism at its finest, but hopefully some eyes have been opened up to the Tyler, the Creators and the Young the Giants of the music world, who have more to offer than flashy videos and record sales.
