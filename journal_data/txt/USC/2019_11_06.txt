Panelists spoke about whistleblowing within American companies and political institutions at a  Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy event Tuesday.
The panel featured Tom Mueller, author of “Crisis of Conscience;” Jack Poulson, a Google whistleblower and former Stanford University assistant professor; Mary Inman, a whistleblower attorney; and Gavin Hood, a South African filmmaker and director of “Official Secrets,” which details the true story of a British whistleblower. Geoffrey Cowan, director of the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy, moderated the discussion.
 Mueller said those who expose company secrets are often perceived in a negative light and explained the reasoning behind their unfavorable image.
 “The individual becomes the traitor, the snitch, the rat even though we as a society, our founding documents celebrate truth and justice,” Mueller said. “When someone turns on you, it can be very personal. Fundamentally, truth and justice are against loyalty and obedience in every one of these categories.”
 Poulson discussed his experience at Google, where he quit his job after learning the company would launch a censored version of its search engine in China. Poulson then wrote an editorial in The New York Times, which publicized the issue. 
 “I saw a blacklist that literally contained the term ‘human rights’ on it, which was more than a little upsetting,” Poulson said.
 As a seasoned attorney who specializes in representing whistleblowers and partner at Constantine Cannon LLP, Inman pointed to the relationship between lawyers, journalists and whistleblowers. Inman traced the origins of whistleblowers back to the False Claims Act, a law enacted in 1863 — and later amended in 1986 — that imposed liability on companies that attempted to defraud the government.
“From 1986 to present, there are $60 billion in return to the U.S. Treasury as a result of cases by whistleblowers. Why is that?” Inman said. “It’s intuitive to everyone in this room who is a journalist, which is, whistleblowers, like your sources, know where the bodies are buried. There’s no substitute for a well-placed insider.”
 Inspired by the same reasons as mentioned by the others, Hood, who had not planned on speaking on the panel, shared his experience working on his film. He detailed the process he took researching whistleblowers and interviewing whistleblower Katharine Gun regarding her involvement in exposing illegal activities of the United States leading up to the Iraq War.
Hood said he was fascinated with Gun’s story after doing some initial research but was skeptical when it came to making the film. 
 “My first reaction was, ‘Well, you know, she’s a spy, she must have been in a dirty world, what did she think she was getting into?’” he said. 
However, upon meeting Gun in person, Hood said he understood the significance of the whistleblower and the bravery it takes to expose hidden truths. He said whistleblowers play an important role in democracy. 
Josh An, a junior majoring in communication, said he gained a new perspective on whistleblowers and the challenges they face. 
“I didn’t know how tough it was for whistleblowers to actually come out,” An said. “I think on the outside it seems easy like, ‘Oh, just expose something that you see that’s bad,’ but in reality, there’s so much stacked up against them, and I think that was really surprising.”

The young USC women’s basketball squad rolled past the CSU Northridge Matadors Tuesday night at the Matadome in Northridge, Calif., with a solid 69-53 win. The Trojans maintained a double-digit lead for the majority of the game, proving the capability of the six freshmen who took the court.
Freshman forward Alissa Pili dominated the stat sheet with 18 points and 13 rebounds in her debut. Freshman guard Endyia Rogers matched Pili’s 18 points, going 3-for-8 from behind the 3-point line and notching seven defensive rebounds.
Returning sophomore Desiree Caldwell said she was not surprised by the newcomers’ impressive outing.
“I see it every day during practice,” Caldwell said. “I know how talented they are, and for the rest of the season, I only expect them to get better. As they gain more experience, they’re going to learn new ways to score and contribute to the team.”
The Trojans kept CSUN in the single digits through the first quarter, but the Matadors quickly adjusted in the second quarter and forced turnovers that narrowed USC’s lead to 7 points. Graduate transfer Stephanie Watts stalled CSUN’s advances with two 3-pointers and a defensive rebound that forced a CSUN timeout. The Trojans closed out the first half with a 33-23 lead.
The third quarter sealed the deal for the Trojans. The team shot 69.2% from the field and mounted its defensive pressure to hold the Matadors to just four baskets in the quarter. Another notable contributor to the Trojans’ runaway lead was their near-perfect free throw performance, hitting 17 of 18 attempts for a 94.4% mark.
USC shot 44.2% for the game compared to CSUN’s 24.4% field goal percentage. The Trojans also won the rebound battle with 46 defensive boards, a testament to their aggressiveness down low. The one battle the Trojans lost was turnovers, as the Matadors forced 20 while USC came up with 13.
Head coach Mark Trakh was not too concerned about the high number of turnovers committed by his young squad. For a team led by players just entering the college basketball scene, it’s expected that some ball-handling adjustments must be made according to the game’s faster pace. 
“We had five freshmen out there a lot of times,” Trakh said. “It was their first college game, so it’s understandable. We’ll get better, but the turnovers don’t bother me that much.”
The Trojans handling of the CSUN full-court press acts as a precursor to their matchup against Virginia this Saturday at Galen Center. While they have a lot of youth as well, the Cavaliers have some experience under the backboard with 6-foot-3-inch senior forward Lisa Jablonowski and in the backcourt with senior guard Jocelyn Willoughby.
“We were able to see in this game [that] when we dribbled too much and overpenetrated, we [turned] the ball over,” Caldwell said. “But when we passed to our teammates and got each other the ball, we were really hitting wide open shots. So [we’ll] just [focus on] ball movement and be ready for the athleticism that Virginia is going to come at us with.”
Saturday’s lineup for USC is still up in the air. Both senior forward Kayla Overbeck and graduate guard Aliyah Jeune sat out Tuesday’s game due to injury. The coaching staff has a deep roster of guards to fall back on, with freshmen Alyson Miura, India Otto and Kyra White all seeing playing time against CSUN.
The Trojans have three days to review the game tape and decide which freshmen can make the adjustments necessary to avoid turnovers and keep the ball moving in their first home game. USC tips off against Virginia 2 p.m. Saturday at the Galen Center.

Irene Hirano Inouye, president of the U.S.-Japan Council, had always known that she wanted to pursue public service. Though she considered a career in government, Hirano Inouye, a USC alumnus, chose to pursue nonprofit work. 
“I felt that I could perhaps do more on the nonprofit side,”  Hirano Inouye said. “To work in government doesn’t give you the same opportunity to be creative, to be entrepreneurial as nonprofit organizations and I felt I could contribute to building communities, to building public service.”
The U.S.-Japan Council, along with Hirano Inouye, recently returned to Los Angeles to hold its annual conference at the Loews Hollywood Nov. 4 and 5. The conference focused on showcasing diversity and providing development opportunities for those in attendance. 
Hirano Inouye is an L.A. native and always knew she wanted to attend USC. After being offered a scholarship from the University, she decided to major in public administration. She also pursued a graduate degree in public administration at USC. 
Hirano Inouye said she faced several barriers in college, including being only one of three women in her program at the time. However, despite a “lack of diversity” within the program at the time, she described her professors and classmates as some of the most knowledgeable people she was able to meet through this opportunity. 
While studying at USC, Hirano Inouye worked at the Center for Social Action. 
“That afforded me the opportunity to look at ways to impact the social sector and ways to understand better the needs that different communities have in [L.A.],” she said.
Hirano Inouye’s experience in social activism spans nearly five decades. After finishing college, much of her early work was focused on improving access to healthcare for women and other underrepresented groups, one of the pioneering efforts on the community level at the time.
“I think that it was important that we had staff that reflected the diversity of the community as well, and I think that certainly health care … especially accessibility for women’s health care remains, today, still a major issue,” Hirano Inouye said. “At the time it was even more of a critical issue and certainly the efforts to build clinics that will be of service to the diverse communities was something that was just beginning.”
Hirano Inouye has been committed to strengthening the diplomatic ties between the United States and Japan through nonprofit work for more than 40 years. 
“The U.S.-Japan Council, which was formed to ensure strong relations between two countries … that type of the people-to-people relationship is so critical in ensuring that we have a strong foundation,” Hirano Inouye said.
The U.S.-Japan Council rose to prominence nearly 10 years ago, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck the Tohoku region of northern Japan. As a result of the damage, many young adults left the region in favor of greater opportunity for work in metropolitan areas, a trend Hirano Inouye and the U.S.-Japan Council worked toward rectifying. 
“The U.S.-Japan Council is a reflection of [Hirano Inouye] … in terms of coming up with the importance of strengthening U.S.-Japan relations.” said Alan Nishio, who worked as an administrator at various universities throughout his career and has known Hirano Inouye since her days at USC roughly 51 years ago. 
Nishio commended Hirano Inouye for her efforts in bucking the trend of mass exodus of young adults from rural areas of Japan following the Tohoku earthquake in 2011, which has been vitally important to the redevelopment of the region. 
“The areas up there were typically more like old people and school-age children … the U.S.-Japan Council has done some work to try to provide opportunities for young people there to be able to stay in that community,” Nishio said. 
Nishio stressed Hirano Inouye’s devotion to her work, saying that she often takes on roles that would be unpopular because of the potentially daunting amounts of work involved, which he notes doesn’t seem to phase Hirano Inouye in the slightest.
Hirano Inouye’s activism is not limited to her work with the U.S.-Japan Council, as she worked in the administration of three different nonprofit organizations, including 13 years as executive director at the T.H.E. Center for Women, 20 years as president and CEO of the Japanese American National Museum and the past decade as president of the U.S.-Japan Council.
Jim Ferris, director of USC’s Center on Philanthropy, acknowledged Hirano Inouye as someone who always supports others.
“[She’s] always enabling others and creating pathways for them to advance and succeed,” Ferris wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I think she lives on a plane.” 
Though she spends most of her time in Washington, D.C., Hirano Inouye assists with fundraising at the USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, while promoting innovative ways to encourage philanthropy and communication from those who have typically been affiliated with the University but haven’t considered donating. 
In addition, Hirano Inouye has spent significant time developing the Asian Pacific American Alumni Association, which she said has seen many individuals go on to serve on USC’s Board of Trustees. 
When he and Hirano Inouye were on the same delegation to Japan, Nishio said she was the first person at work each morning and the last one to go to sleep each night.  
“I knew at the time I could never outwork someone like her,” he said.  
Hirano Inouye spoke about her belief in the importance of understanding perspective, conveying her passion for making an effort to learn where others are coming from as an imperative aspect of promoting progress and productive discourse moving forward. 
As a nonprofit worker, she stressed the importance of “building networks” and connecting people in her efforts to achieve proper treatment and funding along many avenues of typical injustice. Nishio said he thinks Hirano Inouye deserves more recognition for her nonprofit work.
“If you were to ask her what does she do for recreation or leisure activities, I think she would have a hard time answering that,” Nishio said. “To me that’s kind of overlooked as how she has really singularly dedicated herself … the cost that’s associated with that.”

It took some time for Carlos Acosta to find his community at USC. 
Acosta, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, transferred to USC as a spring admit in 2019 and hoped to find a community of fellow students who understood his Venezuelan background.
Acosta, who immigrated to the United States from Venezuela when he was seven, couldn’t find that community at first and is now looking to create a cultural club of his own that involves the Venezuelan population on campus. 
 Acosta was inspired to start the club because of his personal interactions with the Venezuelan community in Miami where his family lives. 
“Given the fact that I do a lot of community service with my family, we do a lot of collection of items that we send to Venezuela, and we do a lot of fundraisers, and we do a lot of food drives,” he said.  
 By creating the club, Acosta also hopes to educate the USC community on political and social issues in Venezuela because these issues aren’t properly reported on in the mainstream media. 
When he attended a solidarity protest in February and wore the Venezuelan flag around campus like a cape, Acosta said that students didn’t know what country the flag represented. While Acosta doesn’t blame students for not knowing about every country, he wants the club to educate more people on campus about Venezuela. 
“Ever since I moved here, I feel like a lot of students and sometimes faculty just don’t know about the situation that is happening right now in Venezuela,” he said. “Socialism has gotten so far, and it gets so far out of hand. It’s almost like a dictatorship situation, but it looks very democratic outside of Venezuela.”
Venezuela is currently undergoing economic and political strife. Thousands of citizens are taking to the street in protest of President Nicolás Maduro, alleging the government has perpetuated mass food and oil shortages.  
Acosta hopes students of all backgrounds can join the club to learn about Venezuelan history, culture and current events.
He is also currently working with his aunt, Marydee Marchan, to bring more resources to Venezuelans back home. They created an organization called All for Venezuela, where they collect donations such as toiletries and baby formula to send to the country.
The organization Acosta hopes to create on campus will help All for Venezuela reach out to the student population that otherwise does not know about the dire economic and political situation in Venezuela and teach them about the country’s culture and history through mixers, collection drives and outings.  
“It’s more to create awareness, especially in California,” Marchan said. “It’s been a little bit too far from Venezuela. Our community is very small so there’s not too much, you cannot hear in the news or you don’t see on the newspapers.” 
Marchan said the organization also needs to raise money to send these donations to Venezuela because of increased shipping rates from the United States.
 Andrea Marin, a junior majoring in visual anthropology and economics, is an avid supporter of the work Acosta is doing to start the organization. Marin, who is also Venezuelan, met Acosta when she donated goods to All for Venezuela.
 Marin said she appreciates Acosta’s efforts to raise awareness of the Venezuelan crisis because of the lack of knowledge around campus and in the United States in general. She also said she hopes that with the creation of the club, students on campus will have a better understanding about a topic that isn’t discussed in mainstream media. 
She hopes that through the personal connections Acosta makes through his club, students will feel more empathy toward the people of Venezuela.
“There’s not many Venezuelans on USC’s campus, but Carlos is definitely one of the loudest voices talking about what’s going on,” she said. “I think it’s really important even just getting the word out. He’s who don’t know about what’s going on, so I think that’s really crucial, and I really admire him for that.”

After allowing Oregon to score five consecutive touchdowns in a 56-24 blowout over the weekend, the Trojan defense looked healthier at practice Wednesday. With key playmakers sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga and freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson likely to jump back in against Arizona State, the squad looks forward to a more complete showing in Tempe, Ariz.
“We’ve got a very workmanlike group,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “They came in here ready and hungry and wanted to see the tape as quickly as they could and move on to make the corrections … So it’s been a good couple days.”
USC contained Oregon senior quarterback Justin Herbert out of the gate, but let up after redshirt sophomore safety Isaiah Pola-Mao’s ejection in the second quarter. Overall, the unit allowed Herbert to complete 80.8% of his passes and account for four total touchdowns while only forcing one turnover.
“It’s definitely hurtful because I couldn’t even come back to the sideline and talk to my guys, rally them up,” Pola-Mao said of Saturday’s ejection. “It’s just sad being in the locker room when the team is out there. Being by myself in there, it’s something I don’t plan on doing again.”
The time since Saturday’s blowout at the Coliseum has been spent nursing injuries, reviewing film and preparing for Arizona State’s mobile offense. With Pola-Mao back in the lineup, along with likely returns from Hufanga and Jackson, the Trojans’ young defense has a revived leadership corps. 
Even with that starting talent restored to the game plan, the Trojans aren’t underestimating the Sun Devils’ offense. Arizona State true freshman quarterback Jayden Daniels — a dual-threat with scrambling talents reminiscent of Arizona’s senior signal-caller Khalil Tate — maneuvers gracefully through the pocket and confuses opposing secondaries.
“He’s a different type of scrambler,” defensive line coach Chad Kauha’aha’a said. “If there’s any type of opening, he’ll take it. So we’ve got to be highly, highly aware of it.”
USC’s defense can’t afford to lose focus against such a talented quarterback. Arizona State ranks No. 19 in red zone offense, scoring nine rushing and three passing touchdowns in 25 attempts this season. Daniels has only thrown two interceptions through eight games and won’t likely give the Trojans many chances to turn him over the ball.
Sun Devils junior running back Eno Benjamin is also an elusive presence. With 679 rushing yards and seven touchdowns on the season, the speedy, dynamic player is a weapon in the Arizona State backfield.
“They have talent all around the board,” Pola-Mao said of Arizona State’s offense. “At receiver they have great talent, quarterback and running back … As long as we communicate and do our job and play Trojan football, I think we’ll be good.”
If USC intends to stay in the Pac-12 Championship conversation, it must win out against ASU, Cal and UCLA. That requires the Trojans to display a prowess on the road they haven’t yet shown this season.
But first things first, USC needs to focus on discipline and carrying out its assignments against a dangerous Arizona State offense. Back from the shoulder injury that sidelined him since the Trojans’ romp over Arizona Oct. 19, Hufanga seems ready to reassume his leadership role in USC’s young secondary.
“Whatever the coaches want, I’m just trying to pay attention to detail in our practice and know my assignments,” he said. “If I get the opportunity to go in, I’ll make the most of it.”

Many expected that by the end of this week, Los Angeles Football Club would be hoisting the MLS Cup trophy. Especially after its commanding playoff victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy — its first win over the crosstown rival in franchise history — a perfect ending to the season seemed within reach.
However, during last Tuesday’s Western Conference Final, the No. 2 Seattle Sounders ended LAFC’s record-breaking season, handing the club a 3-1 loss.
Midfielder Eduard Atuesta gave LAFC the early lead in the 17th minute with a curling free kick from 25 yards out. However, the Seattle Sounders equalized five minutes later with a goal from forward Raúl Ruidíaz and went on to score another unanswered goal. On paper, LAFC seemingly dominated the game with 69% of the possession and an 88% pass accuracy compared to Seattle’s 68%.
However, the boost provided by the Sounders’ recent history of playoff success couldn’t be discounted.
Since its inaugural season in 2009, Seattle has never missed the MLS Cup Playoffs. The Sounders are going to their third MLS Cup final in four years and are looking to win their second championship in that span.
The results of last Tuesday’s semifinal showed what Seattle has learned from its abundant playoff appearances: how to win games when losing means an end to a hard-fought season. 
Throughout the game, the Sounders capitalized on limited opportunities to score. They were also successful in not allowing Vela to get on the scoreboard. Throughout the match, Seattle was physical and assertive — often putting two or three men on Vela.
Still, Seattle’s opportunistic play and its approach to defending Vela are not the only reasons it won against LAFC. 
Although it did not end as many expected, LAFC’s season is still one to be celebrated and admired. 
While the team will not be raising the MLS Cup trophy, LAFC was well-represented in the MLS’s year-end awards. Following a season in which his team claimed the MLS Supporters’ Shield, LAFC head coach Bob Bradley deservingly won the 2019 MLS Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year award. 
Golden Boot winner and LAFC Captain, Carlos Vela, also claimed the title of 2019 Landon Donovan MLS Most Valuable Player — the highest achievement for MLS Players. Vela was also the first Mexican MVP.
Looking ahead to the future of LAFC, I believe there is a lot of hope. With a top-notch coach in Bradley, world-class striker and captain in Vela and many other talented players that were essential in LAFC’s incredible season, there is a lot for fans to look forward to. 
Patience will be key in waiting for LAFC to finally win the MLS Cup. Looking at the Seattle Sounders, added playoff experience will benefit LAFC immensely — teaching them grit, persistence and fighting as one unit towards one goal. 
While it is easy to look ahead with hope as to what the team can be in the future, there is a lot for LAFC fans to celebrate now. As a second-year club that broke records left and right, LAFC has set the standard for future expansion teams. This past season will be remembered for showing just how dominant a team can be in the MLS.

The USC Sustainability Strategy 2030 and President Carol Folt’s Zero Waste Inauguration plans have highlighted the school’s enthusiastic pursuit of environmental sustainability, and food sustainability has emerged as an important area of focus. Although the school does recognize the importance of maintaining food sustainability, the strategies are limited to food source regulation rather than food conservation. By providing reusable to-go boxes in dining halls, the school would encourage students to not only produce less food waste but also carry out sustainable living habits. 
Providing reusable to-go boxes at the dining halls would allow students to make more rational dietary choices. Currently, all three dining halls on campus offer the 
swipe-and-eat-all-you-can policy, where people are free to take as much food as they want. Freshmen may have a more impressive meal plan — they prepay at least $3,150 for unlimited swipes into the dining halls. 
Diners, however, are not allowed to take food out of the dining halls, and they do not have the option to take the food to-go. The current dining policies are clear and straightforward. However, the policies do not appear to be environmentally conscious enough. 
For one thing, many people may get more food than they are able to eat. This is a problem for both individuals who have the unlimited swipes meal plan and those who do not. The buffet-style dining creates an incentive for people to eat as much as they can and take advantage of the value of the swipe or the money they spend. This is not an environmentally opportunistic act — it’s normal. Provided with the various food choices, people may even unconsciously take more food than they are capable of eating, resulting in more food waste. 
With the reusable to-go boxes, students are encouraged to take a more reasonable amount of food. Since to-go boxes have defined sizes, they ultimately prevent diners from taking too much food. Rather, people are more likely to hone the responsibility of planning what and how much food they will consume. 
A more common situation is that students may not worry about the food left on their plates. However, since they can neither put the food back nor take it to-go, they can do nothing but dump it away. If students have access to to-go boxes, they will be able to take their leftovers with them, reducing food waste by a considerable amount. 
Offering reusable to-go boxes is not an easy policy to implement. Some problems are troublesome, such as the hygiene of returned boxes, the supply and management of the boxes and the financial budget for the boxes. Yet, while the potential problems may impede effective administration, they do not negate the value and benefits of reusable to-go boxes as a significant step toward food sustainability on campus. In fact, the school needs to incorporate those potential obstacles in the policymaking process.
It appears the school has already adopted similar changes, such as the efforts to eliminate plastic straws in dining halls. This past success sheds light on the school’s ability to accept reforms. In fact, providing students with reusable to-go boxes is far from the bold to be proposition one may assume. Many universities, such as Boston College and the University of Georgia, have already implemented this policy, though in different ways. 
The school should be open to embracing all possibilities that are helpful in achieving its goals on sustainability. By providing students with these boxes, the school affirms its belief in sustainability, both pragmatically and innovatively. More importantly, this policy incentivizes food conservation by developing healthier eating habits among students. It is time for the school to plan for a more influential and larger-scale reform in food sustainability.

USC is increasingly diversifying its student body. When USC accepted its Fall 2018 freshman class, 1 in 4 students identify as members underrepresented groups and 2 of 3 students receive financial aid. When the school reports its fall freshman class, it does not have to report its spring admission students. What the University doesn’t tout is that it defers its rich, white students to being spring admits or transfers, which may intentionally inflate its diversity numbers. 
When describing its transfer students, more of the students in the Fall 2018 Transfer Class were white than in the freshman class. Moreover, there’s an ambiguous “international” category in both class profiles that holds 11% of the transfer population.
Curiously, 7% of entering transfers were from preferred European Institutions, which could be where the Trojan Transfer Plan students decide to attend The American University of Paris or John Cabot University in Rome. There are noticeably more legacy students in the transfer class, a difference of 19% to 30%.
What’s more, there is no information on how much financial aid these students received. 
In a 2017 USC admissions blog post, a counselor wrote that all rejected legacies gain the option to join the TTP program, which typically entails spending a year abroad or at a local community college before entering USC as a sophomore. Though not all TTP students are legacies, and not all TTP students are accepted to USC, it’s important to see the relationship between legacy students and their leg-up in the transfer process. 
Timothy Brunold, undergraduate dean of admissions, readily supplied statistics on the Spring Admission and TTP programs, noting that the information is not published anywhere. 
Brunold said the spring admission program started because of  two specific issues. The first is that, by the mid-1990s, the University’s applicant pool exponentially increased, and USC wanted to have more control over enrollment levels without implementing a waitlist, which it feels is unfair to high school students. The second is that the school wants to improve enrollment balances between the fall and spring to fully utilize USC’s capacity for students.  
Brunold said the TTP program is “the University’s commitment to provide counseling and guidance to denied first-year applicants who do not wish to abandon their goal of earning a USC bachelor’s degree.” 
It is important to note that the plan does not guarantee admission. That being said, TTP students have a one-on-one counseling appointment with a USC admissions officer to plan a year that would make them competitive applicants for the following transfer cycle. 
Though those students are allegedly held to the same standard as all other transfer students, it is important to acknowledge that any other student planning to transfer can only access the time of admissions officers in group settings, rather than one on one. 
Moreover, Brunold recognizes that TTP invites mostly legacy students. Annually, TTP students tend to make up about 15% to 20% of the year’s transfer class. 
USC cares about its ranking. A lot. In its reporting that the Class of 2022 broke records for diversity, the USC News reporter barely delves into the merits of the incoming class before mentioning that USC has landed in the top 20 rankings of The Wall Street Journal. The author of the story lauds USC’s rankings for engagement, student-faculty engagement and diversity, among broader factors like graduate salaries. 
USC is a diverse school compared to other private universities, with a student body that is only 30.7% white. But the school should not try to make it out to be more than it is. This is not the first time doubts have been raised about the spring admit and TTP programs. Where there’s smoke, there’s likely fire. 
Brunold said that spring admits are comparable to Fall admits in terms of GPA, standardized tests and financial aid packages but provided no data to back up that claim. To his credit, it is true that the ethnic breakdown of the Spring 2020 cohort of students is rather similar to the Fall 2019 cohort. The TTP ethnic breakdown is shocking in its difference. 
It is not necessarily abhorrent for the school to keep admitting wealthy students. The New York Times recently reported on how the school keeps tabs on wealthy applicants. That is not surprising — the school is a business after all. Those paying the sticker price need to balance out those not paying it and so on. And there are plenty of students who deserve admission that are also coincidentally from privileged backgrounds. It would, however, be wrong for the school to defer those students’ admissions just to inflate rankings. 
A problem is that improving the rankings just attracts more of the elite that USC is trying to defer admission to. It is impossible to imagine the internal struggle that goes on in USC’s admissions office.

2019 has been good to IDK. The 27-year-old rapper from Prince George’s County, Md. was in conversation with prominent rap labels such as G.O.O.D. Music and Top Dawg Entertainment, but opted instead to launch his own label, Clue, through a joint venture with Warner Records. He scored spots on the soundtracks for “Madden NFL 20” and “NBA 2K20” with his singles “24” and “Digital,” respectively. Through Clue, he released “Is He Real?,” his most thematically ambitious work to date, and is now embarking on a tour, aptly titled “Is He Really Touring?”
The 15-stop tour had passed through New York, Chicago, Atlanta and more before making its way to Los Angeles Tuesday night at The Roxy Theatre. The show sold out the 500-person venue in West Hollywood in just six weeks, despite being added to the schedule after the tour was already announced. Before beginning the tour, IDK posted a list of tour rules on his Instagram, telling fans to “come prepared.”
“Come to relieve stress, leave all problems at home. Forget them, they no longer exist,” the second rule reads.
Bronx-born rapper Kemba opened the night with a 30-minute set. The 29-year-old, who’s been on the tour for its entire duration, primarily performed tracks from his recent release “Gilda.” After opening with his self-asserting single “Last Year Being Broke,” he delivered some a cappella verses and shared touching stories about losing his aunt and mother.
“The energy was really dope,” Kemba said. “I saw people that knew the words, and it was super exciting … It was a good way to end the tour for me.”
Shortly after, the lights went dark and IDK’s voice boomed overhead.
“This is a one-minute warning,” IDK announced. “I wanna see the energy through the motherfucking roof when I come out.”
He came onstage sporting a bright orange biohazard suit, matching orange glasses and a black beanie. Sparing no time, he jumped right into the rapid-fire flow of “42 Hundred Choices,” eliciting cheers from fans. Near the top of his set, IDK freestyled over the beat from “24.”
“Bitch I got my own staff / They make magic like they Moses / Say you choosing, well we chosen / White gold with the bezel frozen,” he rapped.
Considering that “Is He Real?” sees IDK grappling with agnosticism, the biblical references here suggest that this may have been a scrapped verse from the album rather than a proper, off-the-top freestyle, but audience members enjoyed it regardless.
Two songs later, IDK adhered to the third rule from his aforementioned Instagram list: “Be ready to come on stage and freestyle if selected (even if you’re not good.)” Considering that Kemba shared a story earlier in the night about being called onstage to rap by Kendrick Lamar and described it as the “one specific day that changed my life,” Noah, the audience member IDK called onstage, had big shoes to fill.
“Know we going wild / In the city with all this style / You know I’m coming in / One, two with the punch,” Noah rapped. 
The true highlights of the show came later in the night, after IDK had shed his biohazard suit to reveal a black muscle tee that offered a good view of his deltoid tattoo of Clue’s fingerprint logo. 
During a slew of pre-“Is He Real?” tracks, including “God Said Trap,” “Pizza Shop” and “17 Wit A 38,” IDK made a seemingly nonchalant announcement.
“I haven’t performed this in a while,” he said as the beat for the Denzel Curry-assisted “No Wave” began to play. “I think it’ll be cool though.”
Then, as if from thin air, Curry himself manifested onstage without any introduction. The pair performed their high-energy verses together, hyping up the already-excited crowd. Curry moshed in the crowd while IDK performed his verse and the pair reversed roles.
“Can I do one more song for you?” the Carol City, Fla., rapper asked the audience before playing “RICKY,” the lead single from his most recent project, “ZUU.”
That wasn’t the only surprise IDK had up his sleeve.
“The next artist I’m about to bring out might have broke the world record, over Frank Ocean, for taking the longest to drop an album,” IDK teased. “But, it’s all about quality over quantity.”
“Free Lunch” by Isaiah Rashad began to play and the Chattanooga, Tenn. rapper came out with a smile on his face. The elusive Top Dawg Entertainment artist, whom IDK supported on “The Lil Sunny Tour” in 2017, notoriously keeps his fans waiting patiently for new music. It’s been more than three years since he dropped his album “The Sun’s Tirade,” although to be fair, more than four years elapsed between Frank Ocean’s releases of “channel ORANGE” and “Endless.”
Near the end of the show, IDK gave a tribute to his mother, who passed away in 2016.
“No matter who you’ve lost, you always gotta take the time to mourn and then take the time to celebrate their lives,” he said. “Whenever someone dies, it doesn’t mean it’s the most negative thing in the world. There’s always some type of positivity to gain from that.”
IDK concluded the show with an energetic rendition of “24,” then acknowledged and thanked fans he recognized from his previous shows. 
Out of genuine love and appreciation for his fans, IDK creates an intimate experience for his fans at his live shows. His direct interactions with audience members and willingness to be vulnerable with strangers allow show-goers to connect with him more than at a typical concert.
The final two “Is He Really Touring?” stops will be this Sunday, Nov. 10, at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw and a homecoming show Friday, Nov. 29 in College Park, Md.

A glance at his LinkedIn includes positions such as office administrator at the USC Fisher Museum of Art and former content and communications director for Roski Mag. His profile is fitting for a fine art major at the Roski School of Art and Design, but Brian Dinh is much more than a typical Roski student. 
Outside of his drawing and painting coursework, Dinh’s focus has shifted his focus past his artistic roots to a new aspect of the creative world. 
“There’s definitely been like a loss of passion for me in terms of my own art endeavors here,” said Dinh, a senior majoring in fine arts, on his four years at Roski — but, as he puts it, “one door closes, another one opens.” 
He’s referring to his growing interest in the fashion industry. After being featured on Man Repeller’s blog and Instagram — a Depop account with 10,000 followers — and an appearance in an ad campaign for the peer-to-peer social shopping app, there is no question that he takes fashion seriously. 
Dinh is a serial thrifter who uses sites such as eBay and Depop to find vintage clothing and rework them for himself or resell them to the highest bidder. His Depop account @koredoko features everything from lavender pointed loafers to custom pieces that feature hand-painted cherub by Dinh. 
Earlier this year, Starling Irving of the independent fashion and lifestyle website, Man Repeller, raved of the Roski senior’s style. 
“On the Venn diagram of unique outfits and timeless outfits, Brian sits square in the center,” Irving said. 
To Dinh’s friend and muse, Zoe Mills, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, there are hints of his personal style in his work. 
“He paints the way he dresses,” Mills said. “His paintings are very indicative of his style overall.” 
Mills has been the subject of two of Dinh’s finished works, and through their collaborations and friendship, she describes  his style in both worlds as “soft but very defined.”
Outside of Mills’ perspective, “Tagging vintage,” “IRL Miyazaki,” “tagging watching one medieval TV show,” “tagging prairie” and “Buffy The Vampire Slayer”; are just a few ways he would describe his own eclectic style. But it wasn’t always this way. 
“I didn’t dress myself until I was 17,” Dinh said. “I’m an Asian American, but I’m raised by Asian parents,” who forced him “to wear a lot of like Abercrombie & Fitch.” According to Dinh, they wanted to exert a certain level of control over his life because of the sacrifices they had made coming to the states. 
Even with his parents’ firm hand on how they wanted him to appear aesthetically (in Abercrombie & Fitch, Dinh explains), his love for art was undeterred.
On Sundays, the Anaheim native would attend Mission: Renaissance art classes, and when the time came to transition into middle school, his art director at the program convinced his mother to send him to the Orange County School of the Arts. He auditioned and was later accepted into the visual arts program. 
Though Dinh’s focus may have shifted to fashion from his roots in painting, his OCSA classmates see a synergy between Dinh in high school and Dinh today. 
Julienne Dawidoff, a senior in art history who has known Dinh for 10 years, recalls waiting in line for a Spanish class and seeing him with a painting similar to some of his current works.
“It was this beautiful Rubix cube of faces and facial features,” Dawidoff said. “He’s come full-circle with artwork.” 
OCSA is where Dinh locates the birth of his style. 
“Going to art school, growing up in Anaheim and Santa Ana, and having those people around me dress in thrifted clothes that are often vintage anyways made me really like the silhouette of vintage,” Dinh said.  
At OCSA, dressing up was second nature to Dinh. 
Thrifting was a popular after-school activity among Dinh and his friends, and although the “1890 period pieces” he wears were nothing out of the ordinary, he believes this level of expression doesn’t translate well to USC and the world beyond. 
“People in college may look at you differently because you dress, not better but differently, in a way that isn’t usually reserved for the classroom setting,” he said. “I think to other people, I’m presenting as someone who’s overdressed at times.”
This summer, Dinh left California for the first time to live in New York City and intern for womenswear brand Orseund Iris. It was there where he really started to grapple with the negative ways in which people can see him. 
“I’m still insecure about a lot of things, about the things I personally wear just because the world is extremely violent on minorities,” Dinh said. “I’m also queer, Asian and bi. I’m afraid of how I’m representing my body and how that’s received in spaces such as the subway at 3 a.m … A lot of my clothing presents as feminine on my body, which is visually male.”
Though his fears of violence were a constant  throughout his time in New York, it was also where he linked up with Starling Irving of Man Repeller to take over the blog’s Instagram story for a day and go shopping throughout Brooklyn. 
“It’s very cool that as a person who sometimes gets dirty looks, shit on, or just assumed that I’m incompetent for dressing the way I do, that I’m also recognized for this act of self-expression and almost bravery,” Dinh said. 
His summer in New York provided him with lessons contrary to what he’s been taught at Roski. 
“Behind the walls of this institution, it’s really apparent there’s a certain form and formula that artists have to follow,” Dinh said. “There are so many avenues for people to learn more about their passions that don’t require any of that … The Man Repeller showed me like a path you cannot find through no matter how many talks you go to from people from Apple visiting on campus.”

“My emergency weed better be moldy before I ever need it,” one of my friends joked during a smoke session. I laughed at how relatable the statement was, how I’ve seen countless friends hoard weed under lock-and-key for a rainy day and how all stoners, regardless of experience and frequency of consumption, seem to treasure weed.
From relatable, shared experiences to absurd jokes to niche memes on Twitter, cannabis has gradually developed a cult following. Though weed has always been a prominent emblem of resistance and counterculture — most notably in the 1960s — cannabis has encompassed a shared, non-political sense of community seen more prominently in contemporary years.
At the intersection of culture, the arts and language, weed is at the core and impetus of many artistic movements, creative works and emerging modes of expression. The substance has received its due credit only recently, as a result of years of activism, education, advocacy and de-stigmatization efforts.
Ask any cannabis connoisseur or casual user, and you will understand that cannabis is far more than just a drug — it’s a shared experience, a collective and, dare I say, a lifestyle. And although smoking weed is not the be-all and end-all of a personality, in some ways, it kind of is. 
Rastafarianism, a religion and social movement that originated in Jamaica during the 1930s, regards weed as a sacred God-given herb, one meant to be consumed and enjoyed like any other naturally-occurring plant. Used specifically for rituals and religious ceremonies, cannabis is seen as a plant that can bring about necessary feelings of introspection, love, peace and unity. Rastas believe the plant can result in increased wisdom and divinity which allows people to get closer to Jah, or God, and see the world more clearly — beyond material possessions and greed.
While I personally do not adhere to Rastafari tenets, I do find truth in the spiritual, meditative and healing qualities of cannabis. Anyone who knows me knows I have a penchant for unabashedly jumpstarting philosophical discussions, diving into complex sociological theories and generally engaging with topics that many shy away from — particularly when I’m high.
Although the high a person receives depends on the strain type, method of consumption and other biological, chemical and physiological factors, I personally experience greater levels of existential understanding when stoned. While cannabis is a substance known for its impairing properties, I find I’m able to weed out distractions, focus more on the present and big-picture elements of life and attain greater levels of serenity within what I perceive to be a chaotic, nonsensical — and often cruel — world.
I’m not saying cannabis is the magical herbal cure to all of life’s problems, but I am saying cannabis is the magical herbal cure to all of life’s problems. But in all seriousness, weed isn’t just about laughing excessively, hibernating inside a room with potato chips and a binge-worthy series on Netflix or any other stereotypes perpetuated by the media (although it definitely can be just that).
Weed is about connection, social change, togetherness and the radical notion that life is so much bigger than yourself. 
“The most important thing is the act of sharing cannabis is at the forefront of the entire community,” said smoking etiquette expert Lizzie Post in a Vox article about cannabis etiquette. “So if you happen to be in a group of people, and you do have weed, and you are about to light something up, offering to share it with someone is pretty huge.”
Even though cannabis isn’t for everyone, I truly believe it can bring people together by easing stress, lowering inhibitions and allowing people to open themselves up to the world around them. 
I struggled to write this column because I found I couldn’t quite put into words the powerful transformative properties weed has. I cannot quantify or explain what the plant has done for me, my anxiety and my overall well-being. Nor could I properly put into words the way it has boosted my social interactions and allowed me to live mindfully.
Cannabis culture is one embedded with history, both good and bad: It’s used in ceremonies and rituals, Prohibition, Counterculture, the War on Drugs, current legalization efforts and more. Sparking a joint, even now, is an act of resistance and a symbol of unity — a demonstration that things are going to be all right.
If this all sounds like a hippie pipe dream to you, maybe you just need to light(en) up.

The USC men’s basketball team hosted Florida A&M in its season opener at Galen Center Tuesday and emerged with a commanding 77-48 win.
Freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu highlighted the victory with an impressive double-double in his collegiate debut. The top-25 recruit from Chino Hills High School posted 20 points, 13 rebounds and eight blocks, tying the school record for rejections in a single game.
“It felt really good [to play],” Okongwu said after the game. “It’s been a long couple of months of practices, and it’s fun to finally go out there and finally play for real.”
The Trojans started off the game slowly in the first half, making only a third of their shots from the field and going 1-of-9 from the free-throw line. 
However, USC stepped it up in the second half, shooting 55.9% from the field and making 13 of their last 14 attempts from the line. 
Despite a poor 3-for-17 3-point shooting performance from head coach Andy Enfield’s squad, there were many bright moments for USC, especially during the second half. The Trojan defense clamped down on the Rattlers, and holding Florida A&M to a true shooting percentage of 32.2% helped USC pull off the 29-point victory.
The Trojans also dominated the interior throughout the night, scoring 50 of their 77 points in the paint. 
“We’re actually a pretty good shooting team,” Enfield said. “[Redshirt senior guards] Quinton Adlesh and Daniel Utomi and [senior guard] Jonah Matthews; these guys are high-level shooters, and they just didn’t make their threes tonight.”
Enfield referred to those three as USC’s best shooters, but added that their combined 1-for-11 3-point shooting night cannot be the norm moving forward.
“That has to improve if we’re going to be more consistent offensively,” Enfield said. 
But there were plenty of highlights that brought Trojan fans to their feet, including all three of freshman guard Ethan Anderson’s alley-oop passes that Okongwu emphatically finished. The two-time California Mr. Basketball winner Okongwu blasted a corner three attempt into the stands for his sixth block of the game before following with a dunk on the other end of the floor. 
USC made five of its last six field goals before the first timeout of the second half was called.
Whenever the Rattlers had a nice play, the Trojans answered right back. Florida A&M redshirt junior forward DJ Jones dunked over USC sophomore Elijah Weaver on a fast break, but freshman forward Max Agbonkpolo answered right back with a 3-pointer to give USC a 21-point lead with eight minutes remaining in the contest. 
Freshman forward Isaiah Mobley also had some highlights en route to a 17-point, seven-rebound effort. The combined abilities of Mobley and Okongwu make for a dangerous freshman tandem.
“The chemistry is there, and I think our games complement each other well,” Mobley said on his relationship with Okongwu. “It made sense for both of us to come [to USC].”
2020 John R. Wooden Watch List member and senior forward Nick Rakocevic played 13 minutes and went 2-for-6 from the field, but Enfield still had high praise for the 2020 preseason first-team All-Pac-12 selection.
“Nick Rakocevic is a terrific offensive rebounder, one of the best I’ve ever coached in my 25 years,” Enfield said. 
Rakocevic ranks No. 15 on USC’s all-time rebounds list with 668 after Tuesday’s game.
USC will host Portland in its next game Friday as the Trojans get ready to compete in four of their next five contests at Galen Center before heading to Florida for the 2019 ESPN Orlando Invitational Thanksgiving weekend. Friday’s game will tip off at 8 p.m. and be broadcasted live on the Pac-12 Network.

The Board of Trustees will undergo a series of changes to its governance structure, including a size reduction, over the next few years, Trustees Rick Caruso and Carmen Nava announced Tuesday in an email to the USC community. Despite the changes, students and faculty leaders voiced concerns regarding the lack of urgency in incorporating student representation in the Board’s restructuring efforts. 
Among the changes, the Board voted to reduce its size from 55 to 35 voting members in the next three years. Along with the 55 voting members, the Board currently comprises 27 nonvoting lifetime and honorary members. The Board also voted to reduce the number of committees from 11 to nine.  
The announcement stated that in the next three years, the Board will also implement term and age limits for all current and future trustees and will focus on increasing its diversity to mirror the diversity of its students. The student body comprised 16.8% Asian, 5.6% African American, 14.8% Hispanic and 30.7% white students last school year, according to the USC Facts and Figures page.
“Part of these reforms, there is a commitment that we’ve made to have the Board reflect the character and the nature of the community that we serve,” Chairman Caruso told the Daily Trojan. “So there’s going to be a push for more diversity at all levels.”
The Board currently comprises more than 60 white members, and out of all voting and nonvoting members, just 26 are women. Nava said these changes will take place over a three-year transition period. 
According to the announcement, the changes, which resulted from efforts spearheaded by the Special Committee on Governance Reform, reflect the Board’s efforts to modernize alongside significant changes at the University. 
A University spokesperson told the Daily Trojan that the vote was “overwhelmingly supportive”; however, the vote count and meeting minutes were not made public.
“Just as USC has grown dramatically over the past few decades, the Board recognizes that we needed to evolve and modernize to effectively steward USC for the years ahead,” said Nava, chair of the Special Committee on Governance Reform, in the release.
Nava told the Daily Trojan the Board has already been undergoing changes since the summer. She said the Board has more of an agenda, longer meetings and allows for more opportunities for members to meet with one another.
Though these changes mark a dramatic shift from the Board’s structure in previous years, Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone and Graduate Student Government President Skye Parral found the lack of student representation on the Board “disheartening.”
“There is an incredible amount of governing space that continues to lack the perspective of the students,” the statement read. “In that sense, it is in the interest of the Board to include students’ perspectives to help make well-informed, inclusive decisions that better the whole of the University. Despite all of this, we do applaud the Board for taking an incremental, positive step toward improving the governance of USC.”
Currently, only one undergraduate and one graduate student serve as observers on three of the Board’s 11 committees. As observers, these students are not able to vote in decision-making processes. The recent changes to the Board’s governance do not address calls for the University to include students, faculty or staff on the Board.
“Over the last few years, a top priority for student leadership was building rapport with trustees and that continues to be a priority for us,” the statement read. “Collaboration between students and the Board is key to the future success of the University, and students across USC are eager to engage with them in more meaningful ways.” 
“Moreover, we believe USG and GSG have built a solid foundation of mutual respect that empowers us to be strong partners moving forward,” it continued.
However, Nava said that students, faculty and staff do not serve on the Board due to the legal responsibilities that come with serving on fiduciary committees. However, Nava added that Board members will continue to reach out to the USC community.
Along with shifts in the Board’s overall composition, its committee structure is also undergoing changes. 
Of the previous 11 committees, four committees were consolidated into two based on “overlapping priorities,” Nava said. The Finance and Campus Planning committees were combined, as were the Alumni Affairs and University Development committees. 
“Since the Campus Planning Committee is addressing capital budget and the buildings on campus and ease the Finance Committee to approve the projects, they had a lot of overlap, so those two committees have been combined,” Nava said. “[Alumni Affairs and University Development committees] have been out working directly with the alumni community and the broader community.”
Additionally, with an expanded charter, the Audit and Compliance Committee will now become the Audit, Compliance, Risk and Privacy Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee has integrated a Human Resources and Culture Subcommittee.
“This is going to be a transition year for our committees, so what we’re going to do is … we’re going to have each of the chairs from these committees start having joint meetings, and then we’ll name the chairs of the committees,” Nava said. “So this year, they will work on a transition plan.”
Membership to the Executive Committee is also undergoing restructuring. 
The Executive Committee has served as the decision maker on some of USC’s most pressing issues, such as the investigation into former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito, who abused drugs on the same days he saw patients. The investigation has yet to become public. 
And while members of the Executive Committee were kept confidential for years, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Trojan in March, Caruso revealed the names of its 17 voting members and five nonvoting members. Of the 22 members, 18 are men and four are women. 
With these new changes, Caruso has pledged to restructure the Executive Committee to comprise him, immediate past Board Chair John Mork, President Carol Folt and the eight committee chairs. 
“There certainly will be [more females on the Executive Committee],” Caruso said. “We’re not going to be adding any more Board members soon because we’re reducing the size of the Board, but the makeup of the Executive Committee … is going to be very, very different,” Caruso said. 
According to Caruso, the Board will continue to look for ways to incorporate more representation from students and faculty.
“The work here has not ended,” Caruso said. “It is an ongoing process, so a number of those proposals would include: how we include faculty, how we include deans potentially, how we include students. Is it at a Board level? Is it at a committee level? So the Governance Committee is going to continue to work on that. We wanted to get a large number of reforms put in place as quickly as possible, and that’s what these represented.”
Ariela Gross, chair of Concerned Faculty of USC, said these new changes will definitely be an improvement, saying that reducing the size of the Board will ensure efficiency and allow for a more level spread of voices.
“I think they’re a really important first step in improving governance here,” Gross said. “You know things like the term limits of the smaller board … all of those things are going to make the Board work better and be more able to react if something should happen again that requires their attention.”
However, she said that the Board of Trustees must next focus on including faculty voices and developing its relationship with them.
Other changes announced Tuesday include establishing new role requirements and criteria for future life and honorary trustees, as well as posting all committee memberships to the University website. No concrete timeline has been set.

A resolution aiming to ease the academic transition for transfer students was proposed during an Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. The resolution advocates extending the Freshman Forgiveness program to transfers. The program currently allows first-year students to retake up to three classes in which they received a grade of D+ or below.  
If passed, the resolution will allow transfer students to retake up to one course of any undergraduate level from their first semester at USC. It referenced data from a survey conducted by the USC Transfer Student Community that revealed 89.4% of the 565 respondents believed extending the forgiveness program “would help transfers if provided.”  
Sen. Angela Chuang, who transferred from George Washington University, was inspired by her difficulty adapting to the environment at USC to help author the resolution. 
“I definitely saw a significant change in the rigor of my academics when I came from my old school … My transition was a little rough,” Chuang said. 
Other personal testimonials from transfer students who struggled during their transition to USC were also included in the resolution. One student said that struggling to raise their GPA after underperforming during their first semester at USC led to lower self-confidence and contributed to a harsher transition. 
Chuang believes that extending the policy would be an important step in improving the transfer experience. 
“It’s supposed to be designed to help alleviate students of that stress, knowing that they can possibly retake a class if they’re not doing well and, hopefully, focus efforts on what they need to,” Chuang said. 
The resolution cited multiple studies on the “transfer shock” phenomenon, which theorizes that the change in academic environment for transfer students results in a GPA dip during their first semester at a new institution. 
Later during the meeting, the Election and Recruitment team presented changes to the 2020 USG Elections Code. The team incorporated feedback from senators in their proposal to change parts of the election process. 
One of the proposed changes limits slates to a maximum of three people. Slates involve multiple candidates running together on the same platform points. Assistant Director of Elections and Recruitment Julia Katcher said that since slates have a historic advantage during elections, reducing the number of people allowed on a slate campaign team will level the playing field. 
The team also changed the definition of a write-in candidate. Write-in candidates will need to be written on the ballot. Previously, write-in candidates names would be printed on the ballot and received many of the same privileges, such as USG advertising their platforms. 
Sen. Christopher McMorran said he appreciated the inclusion of the wellness pact in the proposed changes, saying that  running for office took a toll on his mental health. The wellness pact is a voluntary agreement candidates can sign that emphasizes “the importance of prioritizing the mental health and well-being of candidates during the stressful elections process,” the presentation read. 
Commitment to the pact encourages prioritization of academics and self- care practices such as using mental health resources at Engemann Student Health Center during the elections process. 
The changes also prohibit USG senators, executives and members of the marketing team from publicly endorsing candidates as well as counseling candidates during the race. 
In lieu of advice from senators, workshops administered by the Election and Recruitment team will provide insight for candidates on how to run a successful campaign. 
Additionally, senators proposed a resolution declaring formalized support for the 800 housing and hospitality workers during their new contract negotiations. The resolution stated that “the workers represented by Unite Here! Local 11 deserve good-faith contract negotiations and support from the University community.” 
McMorran hopes the resolution bolsters support for the union and encourages students to respect the workers at USC. 
“These people are not invisible,” McMorran said. “They are here, we interact with them every day. “ 
Sen. Emily Johnson said that the testimonials from workers motivated her work on the resolution and emboldened her to educate other students through clipboarding campaigns. 
“I have heard several people talk about how it’s great that they get benefits, but that shouldn’t be a substitution for a livable wage, especially one that doesn’t keep pace with the increase of living in Los Angeles,” Johnson said.
