A strong offensive effort would stunt the USC women’s basketball team (15-13, 7-10 Pac-12) in their fight against the Washington Huskies(21-8, 10-7 Pac-12). The Women of Troy lost 60-48, dominated by three players in the Huskies arsenal. The women of Troy would endure the next 40-minute contest without senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama, who did not play because of an injury.
“It’s hard when you don’t have your go-to players in the line up, but I really thought we fought hard,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We did some really good things offensively and defensively, we just really couldn’t get into an offensive rhythm consistently throughout the game.”
Senior forward Kaneisha Horn lead the Women of Troy in scoring with 13 points and nine rebounds. Sophomore guard Jordan Adams also added 12 points and nine rebounds to the Trojan cause.
Scoring was slow for both teams in the first half. The Women of Troy shot at 32 percent to the Huskies 37 percent. Early on the game, the Women of Troy and the Huskies kept the game close. Freshmen guard Courtney Jaco and junior guard Brianna Barrett launched two shots behind the arc, keeping their deficit small.
“We had a few issues with getting ourselves organized; I think we took some quick shots,” said Adams. “I felt we played really good defense, we made them shoot contesting shots for most of their possessions.”
Talia Walton had a strong offensive presence with 6 points in the first 10 minutes. Adams responded by securing the lead with field goals.
USC hit a dry spell deep in the half, allowing the Huskies to make up for lost time. The efforts of Kelsey Plum and Jazmine Davis would put USC at a disadvantage. Horn would break the silence with a field goal for the Trojans after almost four minutes of not scoring.
Barrett kept the offense rolling with a layup and a free throw. However, this was not enough to overpower Washington.
Neither teams were able to score for two minutes. After a flurry of rebounds and missed shots, Horn hit a successful jumper. Freshmen forward Amy Okonkwo then bumped the Women of Troy pass Washington after a trip to the line.
The half ended with USC having a one-point lead and collected more blocks and assists than the Huskies.
At the beginning of the second half, USC racked up five points in the first five minutes.
Freshmen guards MacKenzie Calvert and Jaco would grab an assist each. Plum would put pressure on the Trojan defense, finding ways to score.
“Mostly we wanted to play fast and get out on the break,” said Okonkwo. “I feel like we need to execute more and play defense better, play more defense.”
After being tied at 30 USC’s offense slowed down while the Huskies began hitting shots. Plum would contribute to the Huskies offense while Horn continued to keep USC in the game.
With nine minutes left in regulation, the Huskies held an 11-point lead and would keep the Women of Troy at a distance.
The Women of Troy will battle against the Washington State Cougars on Saturday at 3 p.m. in their last game of the regular season.

The Viterbi School of Engineering and the Klein Institute for Undergraduate Engineering Life programming committee hosted Engineering Week as part of National Engineers Week, a week in February dedicated to raising awareness of the positive contributions engineers make to society.
Christine D’Arcy, assistant director of student engagement and career connections at Viterbi, said the events this year covered social, community outreach, academic and career aspects.
“We have fun social events, just to bring the community together and celebrate all of the hard work everyone puts into engineering. We also have academic events, like the quiz bowl, testing your knowledge,” D’Arcy said.
National Engineers Week was started in 1951 by the National Society of Professional Engineers in conjunction with George Washington’s birthday. Washington is considered the nation’s first engineer, notably for his survey work.
“[E-Week celebrations] have changed over the years; some years we do more stuff than others, but the last couple of years, the KIUEL programming committee has taken on programming for students for the week,” said D’Arcy.
D’Arcy said the outreach events have been an important part of E-Week for a long time.
“We’ve been doing Discover Engineering Day with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and then this year is the first year we’ve done something for Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day,” D’Arcy said. “So we had about 30 middle school students from Englewood here to learn about circuits and computers. We’re doing a workshop on pitching and presenting, which is all the important skills engineers need to be successful.”
KIEUL was established to provide Viterbi undergraduates a variety of personal and professional activities that will enhance undergraduate engineering student life experiences outside the classroom.
“This year is probably one of the biggest planning committees we’ve had in recent years.  We have students from all majors and years participating in the planning committee. It’s really representative of all the different types of students we have here at Viterbi,” D’Arcy said.
Betty Stearns, marketing coordinator of the KIEUL programming committee, said she knows a lot of people are looking forward to Viterbi Ball because it’s during midterm season and it gives them something to look forward to.
“This year, we stepped up our social media game a lot,” Stearns said. “All of our events have had a higher attendance, especially Viterbi Ball — we sold out much quicker. The Kickoff Carnival was really successful and done very professionally.”
Viterbi Ball is a formal dance that gives engineering students the opportunity to listen to good music, unwind with friends, and make lasting memories of their undergraduate experience at USC.
“One of the things we advertise for E-Week is that it’s a fun opportunity for engineers to get out of their hole that they go into when they study and just have fun with other engineers,” said Stephanie Ego, secretary of the KIEUL programming committee. “We have Viterbi Ball and it’s against the stereotype of what people usually think of what engineers do or don’t do.”
D’Arcy said they invited a couple of new speakers this year from companies such as Tech Talks by SanDisk and Facebook.
Jonathan Mooser, a senior engineer on the Feeds Ads team at Facebook and a graduate of the PhD program at Viterbi, spoke about how his experience at USC has helped shape his career aspirations.
“Who you work with is one of the most important decisions you’ll ever make,” Mooser said during his presentation. “The real reason I left my first job is that the whole company is run by marketers and not engineers, and that there was no upfront heavy investment in technology.”
D’Arcy discussed how Viterbi events centered around career programs are meant to help students have an easier time post-graduation.
“The career related events make students think about what they want to do after they graduate and how they’re going to make an impact on the field of engineering after they leave USC,” said D’Arcy.

On Thursday night at Annenberg Auditorium, Visions and Voices held “Voices of South Los Angeles: Food, Recreation and the Arts as Social Justice,” the second of its three-part series examining community building in and around USC and the rest of South Los Angeles. The event was composed of a panel of leaders from the South Los Angeles community to give their input on how to promote social justice.
With a focus on the organizations and movements that are responding to the disparities in the area surrounding USC, the event was organized by Visions and Voices coordinators Alison Trope, Robeson Taj Frazier and George Villanueva and co-sponsored by the Environmental Student Assembly and the Black Social Work Caucus.
“Voices of South Los Angeles” brought panelists from the South L.A. community together to discuss their views on food justice, urban agriculture, community arts and recreation. Panelists included Ben Caldwell, founder and director of Kaos Network, a media and arts organization based in Leimert Park; Karen Mack, founder and executive director of LA Commons; Javier Partida, founder of the Los Ryderz Bike Club, a youth cycling and gang-intervention program; and Neelam Sharma, the executive director of Community Services Unlimited, Inc., where she helped create and develop a food-justice education and training project called “The Community Food Village.”
CSU unites people of all ages, from children in pre-kindergarten to senior citizens, by building urban farms locally. Currently, there are six urban farms located in South Los Angeles.
Sharma began the question and answer session, moderated by Villanueva, by explaining the importance of food to the community.
“Food is one of the best connectors that there is,” Sharma said. “It’s an entry point into any social issue you can think of.”
CSU attempts to bring together various races by allowing community members to first discuss the differences between races that have been affected by oppression and then by using the history of food to highlight commonalities that exist between all races.
Villanueva then turned to Mack and asked her about how the arts are related to social justice. Mack founded and is currently the executive director of LA Commons, a community arts organization that promotes the cultural diversity of Los Angeles neighborhoods through the arts. She is also president of the Board of the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative and an appointed member of the Los Angeles Board of Neighborhood Commissioners.
Mack sees art as a connector between people and as a way of telling a story about a neighborhood. She uses LA Commons to engage artists and transform stories into public art. For example, LA Commons partners with high schools and recruits students to work in the community on art projects such as murals.
Caldwell then articulated his view on art, which he believes is holistic in nature.
Through Kaos Network, Caldwell opening up a discussion with the community on how to take charge of the relationship between media and the arts and replacing the negative media images we are often faced with.
Originally from New Mexico where he was raised as a farmer, Caldwell moved to California to study film at UCLA. He went on to teach at Howard University for three years, where he realized how much he enjoyed working with students. As a result, he founded Kaos Network.
In May 2012, inspired by East Side Riders, Partida founded the Los Ryderz Bike Club, a youth cycling and gang-intervention program that works with other bike clubs to educate youth about bicycles and to organize rides to explore South Los Angeles. The program provides youth with a safe space to talk about problems in the community and come up with potential solutions. Partida has noticed how the program he created has built up the self-esteem and confidence of participants.
“I thought in general it was really eye-opening towards the problems we ignore as USC students,” said Ariel Sobel, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. “The story of the man who got all these kids to bike together and the fact that he personally has made it his goal to make kids feel safe and to have a childhood is really a beautiful and powerful thing.”
A reception held on the second floor patio of Annenberg followed the question and answer session with the four panelists.
“I think the talk tonight brought up some key issues that we as a university need to think about,” said Alexandria Donnelly, a sophomore majoring in communication. “I really enjoyed listening to Sharma discuss her organization, as well as her own experience living in Downtown and South Los Angeles.”
The three-part series concludes on March 7 with a walking tour of South Los Angeles.

The USC men’s basketball team will close out its home schedule against the Washington Huskies in a battle among two of the worst teams in the conference, and the only meeting between the two teams this season. In a season filled with turmoil, USC would love to end its home season on a high note with a big win.
In this penultimate game, the Trojans will lean on their two leaders to pave the path to victory. Sophomore guard Julian Jacobs has developed into a true captain throughout the season and should continue to be a vocal leader for the Trojans in this pivotal matchup. Sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic will also look to be productive and prove that he truly is a go-to option on a team that is constantly looking for a star.
The Trojans are coming off a 70-66 loss to the Washington State Cougars in a closely contested game. The Cougars were led by redshirt senior guard Dexter Kernich-Drew, who had 19 points and five rebounds. Senior guard DaVonté Lacy also added 17 points, while sophomore forward Josh Hawkinson posted a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds.
USC was led by Jacobs, who continued to fill the stat line with 16 points, five rebounds and nine assists. Freshman forward Malik Marquetti had a solid game with 16 points, including four 3-pointers, and redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt scored 16 points off the bench, but it was not enough for the Trojans to best the Cougars.
“I think all teams go through adversity at some point in the season,” USC head coach Andy Enfield told the Los Angeles Times. “We’ve had quite a bit of it.”
Washington is led by head coach Lorenzo Romar, leading scorer sophomore guard Nigel Williams-Goss and junior guard Andrew Andrews, who was recently named the Pac-12 Player of the Week. Andrews had a career night last Sunday against the in-state rival Cougars. He scored a career-high 35 points and even hit the buzzer-beater to win the game. His 35 points were the most by a Huskies player since Brandon Roy way back in 2005. The dynamic pairing of Williams-Goss and Andrews has scored or assisted on 78 percent of Washington’s points over the last six games.
Though the Trojans are focused on beating the Huskies, they have recently been dealing with a lot of off-court drama. During their most recent road trip, three players were sent home for violating team rules, including Reinhardt. Once the team returned, there was a scuffle after practice between two of the team’s starters, Jacobs and redshirt sophomore Darion Clark. Enfield said that the fight had nothing to do with the team’s struggles and that it was a personal issue that was quickly resolved.
“They’re good friends, so there’s nothing there,” Enfield told the L.A. Times. “They’ve made up and they just got into an argument about something trivial.”
The Trojans hope that these distractions will not bleed into their performance at the upcoming Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas. The tournament will kick off on March 11 and run through March 14. It will be held once again in the MGM Grand Garden Arena and will give the Trojans a chance to prove that they can be competitive with the rest of the conference, including powerhouses like the Arizona Wildcats and the Utah Utes, two teams that USC had trouble with earlier in the season. USC will have to do this without freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin, who will miss the rest of the season due to a lingering shoulder injury.
The game between USC and Washington will tip off at 7:30 p.m. on Feb. 28 from the Galen Center, and it will be televised live on the Pac-12 Network.

In today’s society, sports have a special place in the hearts of many. Athletes are looked upon as role models, celebrities, superheroes, even gods in certain cases. If you ask a young child who he wants to be when he grows up, more times than not you’d probably get an answer like “LeBron James” or “Tom Brady.”
Athletes have become so polarizing that sometimes we fans forget that they’re human too. Some sportswriters, myself included, call players “freaks” or “out-of-this-world” because of their natural ability to run faster, jump higher and be overall more athletic than the general public.
It isn’t until we see them in their weakest moments that we truly understand that professional athletes are just as vulnerable as we are.
On Tuesday night, the Chicago Bulls announced that point guard Derrick Rose would undergo surgery to have his already surgically-repaired meniscus repaired. This is just the latest setback for a player who seemed destined for greatness.
In 2011, Rose, in just his third season in the NBA, won the MVP award over the likes of LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard. Known for his freak athleticism and fearlessness attacking the rim, Rose was expected to dominate the league for years to come.
Unfortunately, during a   first-round playoff game in 2012 against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose attacked the rim (like always), set his feet and then the unimaginable happened — he tore his ACL.
The reigning MVP, the superhero in the eyes of many young kids, was brought back to human level.
Rose would spend the next year rehabbing, missing the entire 2012-2013 season.
Adidas had a great marketing campaign chronicling the injured star’s journey through rehab, which led many to believe that their hero would return. And he finally did, just not as long as many had wished.
After just 10 games, Rose would tear his meniscus doing nothing especially strenuous — he simply went to change direction and his knee gave out. Rose spent the rest of the 2013-2014 season rehabbing in preparation for this season. He was healthy and ready to go for the start of the season, but something was off.
No longer did Rose attack the rim with such recklessness, no longer did he strike fear into his opponent — the athleticism that made him a freak was simply gone.
However, Rose adapted, and as the season progressed, he showed signs of the player he used to be.
Rose was finally rounding into shape when news broke of his meniscus tear. Many are now certain that the former savior of Chicago will never return to MVP form.
As fans, we build up players to be so much more than they are.
We truly want to believe that these players are from a different planet or are flat-out made differently than us. How else can we justify looking up to them and adoring them like gods?
A day after Rose’s injury was announced, a much smaller headline hit the ESPN ticker — the Detroit Lions had just released Reggie Bush.
Bush, as most of you know, was a standout college athlete for USC, and just like Rose, he seemed destined for greatness.
When Trojan fans watched Bush play, it was like something out of a video game.
No other college football running back was as fast, versatile or flat out talented as Bush, who won the Heisman trophy before having it taken away from him for receiving improper benefits while attending USC.
Bush won a Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints in 2010, but he played a minuscule role in the offense.
Hoping for a leading role, Bush went first to Miami and then landed in Detroit, where he thrived.
Just like Rose, however, Bush struggled with injuries. Throughout his nine-year career, Bush has managed to play a full season only twice.
Another former USC star, quarterback Matt Leinart, was never able to live up to his hype as well. Drafted No. 10 by the Arizona Cardinals in 2006, Leinart had an impressive rookie season but sprained his throwing shoulder.
Leinart was able to return the next season, but he broke his collarbone in week 4 and lost his job to backup Kurt Warner. Leinart was never able to recover and is now retired.
Leinart and Bush are examples of what can happen to those that are overhyped and similar to Rose’s case, over adored.
The faster we learn as fans that these athletes are human just like us, the easier it will be for athletes to just be athletes.  These athletes never asked for the fame or the pressure of being a hero or god. That was never part of the job description.
By promoting and making athletes feel superior to everybody else, we are basically setting them up to fail. We love them when they are doing well, and we turn on them once they start doing badly, even if it is out of their control.
There are thousands of Bulls fans that loved and adored Rose back in 2011 but are now complaining and wishing that the former MVP would be some other team’s problem.
There’s only so much of a tolerance for players that are so vulnerable to injury and these athletes, like Rose, typically wash out as time goes on.
Unfortunately for athletes, this endless cycle shows no signs of slowing down.

The third-ranked USC women’s water polo team (13-1) is taking a break from tournament play this weekend to face UC Irvine at 1 p.m. on Feb. 28. Almost halfway through the regular season, the Women of Troy have had their ups and downs.
Senior Monica Vavic has been exceptional up to this point, as the No. 2 scorer in USC history is just five goals shy of tying for first. She started the season with 191 career goals and is now at 250. Vavic has been racking up goals left and right, including a USC and MPSF record-breaking performance of nine goals in one game. While head coach Jovan Vavic always maintains his focus on the upcoming game, he also acknowledged how special it is to see Monica thrive in her senior season.
“It is special because her brother was at one point the No. 1 scorer, and I know that she is really respectful of her brother and she wants to go in his footsteps,” coach Vavic said. “We really constantly stress unselfishness and making an extra pass and being a team player, so it is special for me to see that she is playing well, and for a scorer, she is really more than that.”
The whole team started out the season very well, going 10-0 and sweeping opponents at the UCLA Invite, Triton Invitational and Lancer Invitational by a combined goal margin of 229-30. Offensively, the team looked unbeatable. At the Lancer Invite, freshman Brianna Daboub went 8-for-8 in shooting and sophomore Brigitta Games was 8-for-9. In addition, freshman goalie Victória Chamorro is allowing, on average, 3.6 goals per game. All these new players were not only gaining experience, but also confidence. However, last week was a bump in the road for the Women of Troy. At the UCI Invitational, they encountered teams with more talent and suffered their first loss of the season to UCLA, 3-5. They would place third in the tournament after beating California. While USC expected to win the tournament last week, as coach Vavic pointed out, there are positives to take away from it.
“I think that overall in the tournament our defense was pretty consistent,” he said. “We gave up 4.5 goals on average and that’s very good considering we have a freshman goalie. I think she has been playing pretty well and has been consistent so that’s a big positive because at the beginning of the season that was our biggest question mark.”
The UCI Invitational, as coach Vavic notes, had astonishing similarities to last year’s NCAA tournament. In both tournaments, USC lost to UCLA in the semifinals by a score of 3-5 and beat Cal to earn third place. While the Women of Troy have looked good early this season, they still have a long way to go on their mission for another NCAA championship. Yet, he believes this is a different team and a different year, and he is focused on UC Irvine.
“UC Irvine is a very tough team, a well-coached team, and we are preparing for that,” coach Vavic said. “We are in good shape and just got to take care of business in training. That’s the number one thing.”

Any ’90s kid worth their Salt-N-Pepa remembers the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the color-coordinated team of teenage martial artists who used the powers of friendship, multiculturalism and their giant robot Megazord to battle an ever-expanding cadre of intergalactic baddies every Saturday morning on Fox Kids. Now, more than two decades after their first adventure, the Rangers are back in action, and that action happens to be of the R-rated variety.
Earlier this week, a YouTube video entitled “Power/Rangers” went viral, racking up over 11 million hits as of this writing. The 14-minute short, directed by Joseph Khan, reimagines the kid-friendly show as an ultraviolent cyber-thriller, trading the original’s cornball charm and bloodless action-posing for higher production values and copious amounts of gore, drug use and enough four-letter words to sentence the average 6-year-old to a lifetime in time-out.
The basic setup is straight out of Alan Moore’s revisionist superhero comic Watchmen: Years after their adolescent escapades against the likes of Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, a new enemy is systematically killing off the now-adult Rangers, prompting the Second Red Ranger (played, fittingly enough, by ’90s icon James Van Der Beek), now a brutal totalitarian enforcer, to kidnap the Pink Ranger (Katee Sackhoff from the Battlestar Galactica reboot) and use her as bait to catch her old flame, the Green Ranger (Russ Bain). What follows is a kinetic action ballet that plays like the over-caffeinated love child of Zack Snyder and RoboCop director Paul Verhoeven. The tone is deadly serious, but sometimes the best jokes are delivered with a straight face.
Less than 24 hours after the short’s online debut, Saban Entertainment, which owns the rights to the property, issued a demand for the video to be taken down. Sure enough, the film disappeared from YouTube on Thursday, but producer Adi Shankar has vowed to fight the decision, arguing that “Power/Rangers” falls under the sometimes-nebulous definition of fair use, which permits the limited repurposing of copyrighted materials for reasons of parody, criticism or education. If Saban decides to force the issue legally, the result could end up setting an important precedent for fan-made content on video sharing platforms.
There have been plenty of relatively big-budget fan films over the years, and many of them have employed similarly radical tonal shifts in a bid to shock and intrigue viewers. The Pokémon fan base, for example, saw its beloved trading card game transformed into a dystopian blood sport in Ki-Voltage Productions’ popular 2010 short Pokémon: Apokalypse, which involved the eponymous critters being stolen from their loving trainers and forced to participate in underground death matches. The Internet is awash with unauthorized fan creations ranging from the flattering to the perverse, but most companies are reluctant to pursue legal action for fear of alienating their most rabid supporters. So why would Saban pick a fight over “Power/Rangers”?
Before rushing to judgment, it’s important to consider the source. The folks behind “Power/Rangers” aren’t exactly struggling young artists hoping to catch the eye of their idols. Khan has been a successful filmmaker for over a decade now. He helmed the 2004 motorcycle actioner Torque and the enjoyably meta 2011 horror comedy Detention, as well as a variety of music videos for the likes of Eminem, Rihanna and Britney Spears.
Shankar is even more established within the industry, having served as the producer of acclaimed genre pictures such as The Grey, Dredd and Lone Survivor. He also has a long history of financing his own expensive fan films, which he calls “bootlegs,” including the recent Punisher: Dirty Laundry, starring Thomas Jane in the role that should have made him famous back in 2004, and the Man Bites Dog-inspired short Venom: Truth in Journalism, a found-footage thriller revolving around Spider-Man’s symbiote nemesis. Shankar doesn’t actually own any of these characters, but he feels well within his rights to make these “bootlegs” because he doesn’t directly profit from them.
Here’s another issue to consider: What exactly constitutes fan-made content? “Power/Rangers” was never envisioned as a glossy tribute to some forgotten show of yesteryear. It’s an action-packed provocation that knowingly spoofs Hollywood’s post-Batman Begins mania for “dark and gritty” reboots while reveling in the twisted absurdity of comparing the Power Rangers to child soldiers with PTSD. At the end of the day, the whole thing is essentially a live-action Robot Chicken sketch with a runaway production budget.
So why is Saban so intent on taking “Power/Rangers” down? Is the company worried about having its prize brand tarnished? Is it concerned about innocent children stumbling upon the graphic content in the video by mistake? Sadly, the real reason behind all this legal saber-rattling is much more material in nature. Saban is developing an actual Power Rangers reboot in concert with Lionsgate, and it doesn’t want the public to get confused ahead of that film’s planned 2016 release date. All I can say is this: If the Pink Ranger doesn’t curse like a sailor in the official version, I will be sorely disappointed.

Hypocrisy knows no bounds for some members of the College Republicans at the University of Southern California. I say this in response to their remarks about Angela Davis, a civil rights activist and communist who spoke on campus Monday.
The day of Davis’ speech, the College Republicans published statements on their official Facebook page. The first (which has been removed) read, “[Davis] has no place on our campus and should have never been invited to speak.” It was accompanied by a graphic that read, “Shame on the groups responsible for bringing murderer communist Angela Davis to USC tonight.”
The College Republicans hosted Ann Coulter on campus two years ago, a speaker whose bigotry toward race, the Muslim religion and sexual orientation is well known. Viewed in the most positive light, their statements about Davis are blatantly hypocritical. At worst, they are a gross form of offensive character assassination.
The worst thing about arguing that Davis should not have been invited is that it places disagreement with Davis’ opinion on a higher pedestal than a defense of her First Amendment right to express that opinion. Given their devotion to the Constitution, one would expect the College Boat Shoe Club to be extra-staunch defenders of Davis’ right to free speech, but the only support they gave to those seeking to be heard was to their own members:
“It is important that the voices of those students who do not agree with Davis, and her presence on campus are heard!” another Facebook post read.
To defend your right to disagree, you must defend the right to free speech in the first place. The post linked to a video of one of their members, Jalani Smith, who was interviewed by a USC television station about his disagreement with Davis’ talk. Smith began by saying he disagreed with what Davis had to say — and then gave his credibility a significant boost by admitting he didn’t even go to the talk.
The released statements, in the style of 1950s communist purge master Sen. Joe McCarthy, continued:
“The African-American students in the USC College Republicans are particularly disheartened that Davis has been branded as a leader in the Black community…” their statement began. It continued by calling Davis “an enemy to the fundamental American ideals of economic freedom, individual liberty, and self-determination.”
I asked Ama Konadu, the former director of the Black Student Assembly, what she thought.
“The College Republicans said ‘Our African-American members are disheartened…’ that sounds to me like saying ‘I’m not racist, I have black friends,’” she said. “Black Republicans are so prideful in the country and systems that have oppressed our people since day one and that continue to do so.”
It gets worse. The text accompanying the graphic calling Davis a “murderer communist,” that has since been taken down, read, “[Davis] is personally responsible for the murder of four individuals including a judge.”
The accusation refers to Davis’ arrest and trial for murder, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy stemming from a 1970 courtroom attack where four individuals died. While Davis was not present during the attack, the guns were registered in her name. In 1972, an all-white jury found her not guilty of every charge levied against her.
Calling Davis personally responsible for a murder she did not commit is an infuriating, false and deeply saddening action. In much the same way that Davis’ right to speak should be protected by free speech, so too should the nonsense espewed by groups like the College Republicans. But the reckless use of the right to free speech always has social consequences. While Davis might make for an easy target because she is a public figure, the sort of incendiary mudslinging could easily backfire for the College Republicans in another context, in the form of a lawsuit for online defamation.
That aside, it seems a finding of not guilty in a court of law now stands next to the First Amendment on the list of things the USC College Republicans have demonstrated an extreme disdain, if not ignorance for. That must be corrected.
The College Republicans should issue a written statement on behalf of the group, addressed to the Black Student Assembly and the Speaker’s Committee, that apologizes for calling Angela Davis a “murderer” and suggesting that she should have never been invited to speak. Anyone in the group’s executive leadership who wrote or sanctioned the post should immediately resign from their positions.
The College Republicans have demonstrated an attitude completely out of touch with reality. Slandering and calling for the censorship of a speaker with whom they disagree is entirely counter to the meaningful exchange of ideas, a value that all politically minded students, regardless of party affiliation, should defend at all costs.

haha I can’t believe this actually got published
Does this “junior majoring in political science” really believe that the right to free speech means the right to have access to any forum for their speech? Clearly USC needs to review their constitution classes.
Democrats are the hypocrites. They don’t want pro-America speakers on campus.
“The worst thing about arguing that Davis should not have been invited is that it places disagreement with Davis’ opinion on a higher pedestal than a defense of her First Amendment right to express that opinion. ”
It’s unfortunate that a high school graduate, much less a student at a school like USC, could be so ignorant of such rudimentary issues. Whatever one thinks of the College Republicans, this has  exactly nothing to do with First Amendment rights or their infringement.

2.
a person who feigns some desirable or publicly approved attitude, especially one whose private life, opinions, or statements belie his or her public statements.
I would like to applaud you for writing this piece. Your arguments are on point and you’re really saying what needs to be said. The USC College Republicans acted disgracefully and as a student at USC, I am embarrassed to have any affiliation with such a group (even if it is just the affiliation of attending the same university). While they may not agree with Davis’ politics, which is completely acceptable, the way the situation was handled and continues to be handled is unacceptable (regarding their recent press release). 
In regards to this article, your “journalistic integrity” has only improved. Your articles have successfully brought to life multiple social issues on campus and I would like to thank you for that.
You liberal fascists prove your hypocrisy. You want to get pro-America and pro-Israel voices off campus.
Great piece. Thanks for saying what needed to be said
Liberal hypocrites make every effort to ban pro-America and pro-Israel voices on campus.
I’m sorry, but this isn’t journalism. It’s supplying mudslingers with more mud. Can our school newspaper spend its time not calling out on-campus student groups? Shouldn’t we be talking about the College Republicans’ right to free speech? Shouldn’t we be talking about how DT and PSA ignored parts of Davis’ backstory? Is it fair to expect someone such as Jelani– nice job getting his name right– Smith to have attended the event when he disagrees with the speaker’s image?

How antiquated is the moral code of some colleges and universities in the United States? In The Hunting Ground, a gut-wrenching documentary about the epidemic of sexual assault on campuses of higher education across the country, the answer presented is ridiculously clear: very, very backward. The exposé combines a series of vivid first-person interviews and follows a group of survivors as they struggle to both return to normal university life and pursue justice in systems that seem to work against them at every turn.
According to experts cited by the film, false reporting of sexual assault accounts for only 2 to 10 percent of the charges, meaning that more than 90 percent of reported assaults turn out to be true. The Hunting Ground then raises the question: Why do administrators on campuses across the country encourage young women not to report, or worse, question them intensively about their drinking habits and clothing worn on the night of the attack?
The Hunting Ground is firmly based in fact and statistic, and that data begin to tell a story the film doesn’t have to. Given statistics that show one in four women will be sexually assaulted in college, The Hunting Ground begs viewers to wonder why 40 percent of colleges reported no rapes in 2012. Even more perplexing, it muses, why did 95 percent of college presidents say that their universities appropriately handle sexual assaults? While the answers are left hanging, the allegations and calls for a solution are not. Though the presidents of Harvard University, University of Notre Dame, Florida State University, the University of North Carolina, UC Berkeley, Occidental College and Saint Mary’s College all turned down requests to be interviewed for this film, many victims of their poor policies came forward.
At the heart of The Hunting Ground is a mission to humanize and make real the horrific toll that sexual assault has on victims, a toll so high that 88 percent of victims decline to report their experience to authorities at both their universities and the police, according to research cited by the film.
When both their attackers and the University of North Carolina, whom they trusted to protect them, victimized them instead, Andrea Pino and Annie Clark fought back after researching Title IX, the federal law that protects students from gender discrimination in any educational program that receives federal funding. When their complaint against the university attracted national attention from survivors who were inspired to tell their stories, Pino and Clark created a support network dedicated to shining a light on an issue kept in the dark for too long, co-founding the organization End Rape on Campus.
For Kamilah Willingham, a law student at Harvard, the difficulty of achieving justice came when Harvard allowed her attacker to remain on campus despite what she viewed as clear evidence of his guilt. Willingham’s story is part of a larger inconsistency revealed by the film: The punishment levied for perpetrators of sexual assault pales in comparison to the punishment their victims face. The Hunting Ground describes single-day suspensions, apology letters and even one perpetrator who was asked to volunteer at a rape crisis center as just a few examples of the lack of seriousness universities give to the issue.
The Hunting Ground takes aim at two institutions that it alleges have long been protected from serious scrutiny by universities: fraternities and athletics. With regard to the Greek system, in a shocking series of interviews with students from UC Berkeley, University of Tulsa and even USC, students describe a university culture that they feel doesn’t warn them of the risks posed by specific fraternities, and even worse, protects those fraternities from serious scrutiny. According to the film, darker financial incentives may be at play: In 2013, it reports that fraternity alumni were responsible for 60 percent of donations to universities of over $100 million.
When Florida State quarterback (and eventual Heisman Trophy winner) Jameis Winston was accused of sexual assault two years ago, the film describes how the FSU administration quickly came to his defense. Winston’s accuser, Erica Kinsman, publicly speaks out about the entire process in the film for one of the first times ever. When she accused Winston of assault two years ago, she says she entered the scary world of a university bent on protecting its reputation, and above all, it’s football record.
According to the film, FSU is not the alone. It describes disproportionate punishment (and even suspensions that it alleges were intentionally levied after, and not before, major competitions) at the University of Oregon, Notre Dame and University of Missouri.
The Hunting Ground will radically change the conversation about sexual assault at campuses in the United States. It challenges universities to do two things. First, it urges them to radically change the way they deal with survivors who report sexual assault. Second, it implores them to inform students of the danger posed by specific fraternities and other off-campus locations where students gather.
The film will make a splash with ripple effects across every campus it features — but it remains to be seen whether those campuses will listen.
This movie is not a documentary. It’s feminist lies/propaganda put out by feminist CNN. May as well have come out of Joseph Goebbels office.

At the 87th Academy Awards, a television event viewed by 37 million people, Sean Penn joked, “Who gave this son of a b-tch a green card?” shortly before awarding the director of Birdman, Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the Oscar for Best Picture. Penn’s short-sighted joke annoyed most people and caused a rather significant frenzy on Twitter, with journalist Derrick Clifton tweeting, “#OscarsSoWhite A director of color can’t accept an Oscar without being the butt of a racist joke. #Oscars2015.”
Penn’s remark was uncalled-for, especially when immigration reform in the U.S. still has a long journey ahead. President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration have been halted by a district court in Texas. The president’s actions would have protected 5 million of the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants who live with the fearful possibility of deportation. On Feb. 23, the Obama administration requested a “stay” to delay the decision to block the executive action. The president’s immigration policy, as WhiteHouse.gov states, will crack down on illegal immigration at the border, deport felons and check criminal backgrounds for eligibility to stay in the country. Amid the controversial debate over immigration, Penn should have recognized the comment’s innappropriate nature.
But despite the outrageous “joke,” Iñárritu kindly responded in the Oscar press room, “I found it hilarious … When I was directing him in 21 Grams, he was always making jokes like that.” Inarritu’s speech after receiving his award was even more heartwarming: “I want to dedicate this award to my fellow Mexicans, the ones who live in Mexico. I pray that we can find and build the government that we deserve. And the ones living in this country who are part of the latest generation of immigrants in this country, I just pray that they can be treated with the same dignity and respect as the ones who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation.”
Many believe Iñárritu’s speech was directed toward the Mexican government, which is facing an economic standstill on top of gang violence that has killed thousands of its people. Mexico has been on a downward spiral since the Ayotzinapa tragedy in September 2014. Forty-three students from a rural teachers college were traveling to Iguala in the Guerrero state to attend a march commemorating a 1968 student massacre, where, coincidentally, Mayor Jose Luis Abarca’s wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, planned to give a speech. The students’ bus was intercepted en route by the police and taken to Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors), a criminal organization. On Jan. 27, President Enrique Pena Nieto declared all 43 missing students dead.
With one joke, Penn managed to reveal the cruel reality of immigrant hate crimes. It shows the vulnerability with which immigrants live, regardless of their social status. In some ways, we have Penn to thank for accidentally bringing to light the debate over immigration on national television. Because Penn’s incomprehensibly absurd comment has caused outrage and negative responses from the public, the unity of the American people against mocking immigrants has become prominent. Without Penn’s joke, Inarritu’s amazing speech acknowledging the sensitive concern for a green card might not have been sparked.
In the end, Penn’s remark unintentionally provoked the public to agree that immigration is not a joking matter. It led Inarritu to give a speech that empowered the Mexican people to speak even louder against their static government, and it ultimately raised awareness on an issue entangled in legal dispute over the fate of 11 million people.
So thank you, Sean Penn, for bringing attention to an important issue to 37 million people in the U.S. and 200 other countries.

UPDATE: The student who had been critically injured after being struck by the vehicle was identified as 24-year-old Tong Tong, a third-year graduate student studying architecture. She has regained consciousness but remains in the hospital as of March 2.
Four USC students were struck by a vehicle, which then crashed into a traffic light, at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue on Thursday around noon.
One USC student was critically injured, and both the pedestrian and driver were transported to California Hospital Medical Center. LAPD has not yet released the names of the students involved in the collision.
Capt. David J. Kowalski, commanding officer of the LAPD South Traffic Division, said investigators suspect the driver lost control of her vehicle because of a medical emergency.
“During the course of that emergency, she [driver] lost control of the vehicle, went through a red light, hit not only four pedestrians crossing, but [also] hit a light pole and came to stop here at the Northwest corner of McClintock and Jefferson,” Kowalski said at the scene.
Kowalski said the status of two people injured in the collision is not yet known.
“Right now, we’ve had all four persons sustained some type of injury,” he said. “Two of them have been transported to the hospital, we are still waiting on word on their conditions. Two have been treated here at scene and were released already. The driver is being treated for injuries related to her medical emergency at California Hospital [Medical Center].”
LAPD officials declined to disclose any further information on the individuals involved in the collision and have not classified the accident as a hit and run.
The vehicle that struck the four pedestrians was identified as a silver four-door sedan. The driver of the sedan ran a red light and crashed into the side curb in an attempt to stop the car from oncoming traffic.
At approximately 1:45 p.m., the sedan was transported away from the scene.
Several Trojan Alerts related to the collision were sent to subscribers. The first alert, which was sent out at 1:07 p.m., said that there was police activity at Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue because of a traffic accident. The alert stated that westbound traffic from Hoover Street to Jefferson Boulevard, eastbound traffic from Vermont Avenue to Jefferson Boulevard and southbound traffic from 30th Street to McClintock Avenue were all closed.
DPS noted that the accident did not affect pedestrian traffic, only vehicular traffic.
The second alert sent at 2:15 p.m. said Jefferson Boulevard is closed from Vermont Avenue to Hoover Street, and McClintock Avenue is closed from Jefferson Boulevard to 30th Street. The alert also stated that pedestrian traffic was to be closed on the north side of Jefferson Boulevard from McClintock Avenue to Orchard Avenue, and that the entry and exit way at Gate 5 is closed.
The streets reopened to vehicle and pedestrian traffic at 5:45 p.m.

Any update on the injured students, particularly the one in critical condition?
Toyota and Lexus are #1 in cases of sudden unintended acceleration and FORD is #2. The current unintended acceleration plaguing newer vehicles is the electronically-induced type. The engine throttle control systems depend on computer software to command them. Sometimes glitches occur…like in some of your other electronic devices…which can cause the command to be different than what you desire. The evidence of the glitch is often undetectable after the vehicle is restarted. Unfortunately, the EDR (black box) is not always accurate as shown by expert Dr. Antony Anderson in his analysis of a 2012 Toyota Highlander. The EDR results indicated the driver was not braking when she was doing so. The EDR results are inconsistent.
The key to avoiding a horrific crash during a SUA event is whether or not the vehicle has an effective fail-safe in the event a glitch occurs. If it does not, as in the case of the glitch-prone Toyota ETCS-i, then the vehicle may become a runaway with an ineffective means to stop it. Unfortunately, the safety standards aren’t as strict in automobiles as they are in airplanes. Some manufacturers have more effective fail-safes than others. In the case of Toyota, an embedded software expert, Michael Barr (see Oklahoma Bookout vs. Toyota court case involving a 2005 Camry) found that an electronic glitch could induce a SUA event. Another expert, Dr. Henning Leidecker, found that a SUA event could also be triggered by “tin whisker” formation, particularly in 2002-2006 Toyota Camry vehicles. 
SUA events have been DEADLY for vehicle occupants as well as pedestrians and people in storefronts, buildings, and even homes. The numbers of such crashes are ever-increasing with the advent of the very complex ELECTRONIC throttle control systems. 
With the increase in such serious vehicle crashes, there is a concerted effort to show driver “pedal misapplication” or a “medical condition” or some other reason for the incident…anything other than a vehicle defect. Investigators aren’t scrutinizing the buggy electronic throttle control software or other conditions that can elicit a terrifying sudden unintended acceleration incident. They usually just examine the *mechanical* causes which tend to be just red herrings in these cases. Investigators simply don’t have the expertise to find such electronic glitches. In fact, the staff at the NHTSA, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, do not have this very specialized training!
Think of it…the next step in electronically-controlled vehicles seems to be so-called “self-driving cars.” Do YOU want to be in a such a vehicle when there is no evidence that strict safety standards, particularly in the throttle control system’s software, have been adhered to? Will you just BLINDLY trust the automaker (criminally-investigated and nearly-prosecuted Toyota and soon-to-be GM and others?) to come through for you and your family’s safety *on its own*? 
A recently published Huffington Post article by Jonathan Handel,
How Do We Know Driverless Cars Are Safe? Google Says ‘Trust Us’
Posted: 07/01/2014 7:23 pm EDT Updated: 07/02/2014 1:48 pm EDT speaks to these very issues and poses tough questions about Google’s “driverless” vehicles. Educate yourself carefully before you put your faith in automakers who have knowingly lied to their customers and the government for decades. Study the issue of vehicle electronic sudden unintended acceleration and ask WHY we aren’t seeing it addressed publicly. WHY is blame placed on the driver with little more than speculation about which pedal was used or with little more than an assumption on medical condition. This is being done *even when the drivers steadfastly cite a VEHICLE PROBLEM as the cause of the crash. Absence of proof is not proof of absence of a serious ELECTRONIC computer glitch or other electronically-caused SUA. 
Charlene Blake
Toyota and Lexus are known to suddenly accelerate without any input from the driver. Toyota has had sudden unintended acceleration for years now.  Toyota lost the case Bookout vs Toyota in October 2013 where expert Micheal Barr testified the cause of runaway Toyota and Lexus were electronic defects.
Has Michael Barr’s work been independently verified? If not, why not?
“At approximately 1:45 p.m., the sedan was transported away from the scene.”
This statement is just straight up false. It was still there way past 2 pm. What other facts in this article are untrue? Please be more careful.
I sent this email to USC Transpo over two months ago and it mostly went ignored. Whether or not the accident was due to construction, the intersection has become far too dangerous since this school year construction has started.
The vehicle has a USC parking permit on the left side of the front window. The driver has some affiliation to the university.

Londoners are big fans of silence. As a devotee myself, I’ve quickly adapted to the expected quiet on public transportation. In fact, I’ve begun to relish it. And while buses are nice to sit back and look out the window, I’ve found that the London Underground, usually just called the Tube here, is the best place in the city for some good ‘ole self reflection.
It’s a well known fact that Londoners expect quiet on the Tube. As someone who has a deep love of silence but hates physically being alone, the Tube is just about my dream scenario. Joke around loudly with your friends — especially during rush hour — and you’ll likely receive some glares from the locals. So, instead, you must sit or stand quietly as the stations rush by. Nowadays, normal protocol would be to quickly pull out your phone to check Facebook and Instagram and text or snapchat friends. But part of the magic of the Tube, besides the habitual silence of those riding it, is that there’s no phone service.
So you’re forced instead passively ride, bored and first, but slowly lulled into thought by the rhythmic motions of the train barrelling around deep underground. Your mind begins to wander to reflections on the day, the future, just about anything. By the time your stop arrives, you’re a little annoyed at the interruption.
Coming from a college campus full of students shouting across quads and loudly gossiping outside during lunch, London was a bit of an adjustment. But I’ve come to appreciate these moments of solitude, whether I’m with people or alone, riding the Tube, lost in myself.
It might even be a better place to think than the shower.

On Wednesday night in Bovard Auditorium, the USC Marshall School of Business and the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies hosted Tom Barrack, founder of Colony Capital, and Laird Hamilton, big-wave surfer and innovator.  During the session, Barrack and Hamilton shared their views on risk taking and overcoming individual fears in order to live a more exciting and fulfilling life.
Barrack is a USC alumnus and trustee of USC. As chairman of Colony Capital, Barrack has invested approximately $60 billion in assets around the globe, and was named the world’s greatest real estate investor by Fortune magazine.
Hamilton is an American surfer who has conquered some of the most dangerous waves around the world. He has also popularized stand-up paddleboarding and invented several products and surfing techniques.
The event was moderated by David Belasco, the co-director of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, and part of his class, BAEP 470: “Taking the Leap: The Entrepreneurial Mindset,” which is offered every spring.
The event started with the speakers sharing what they each have in common. Barrack, a businessman, and Hamilton, a top athlete, said that they have a similar mindset because every day they encounter risk-filled events.
“I have more in common with Tom than I do with 90 percent of the people I surf with, and that has to do a lot with how our minds work,” Hamilton said.
Hamilton grew up in Hawaii, but because he was born in California and did not look like his classmates, he had a difficult time fitting in as a child. He explained how surfing served as his emotional outlet.
“The ocean was the only place where I could find equality,” Hamilton said,
Barrack grew up with an inner struggle that urged him to become something more than ordinary.
“You always have two options in life: if you like opera, you can either listen to the opera or you can play in the opera,” he said.
Barrack said that he felt ordinary as a kid, because he did not have any exceptional talents.
“I never had any of the tools [to amplify his talents], so I had to find other tools as I was moving along, and one of the tools I found was preparation and perseverance, and quite honestly, absorbing more pain than anyone else,” he said.
Belasco asked the speakers how they looked at risk and what mental and physical preparations went along with risk.   
“Risk is a moment,” Barrack said. “Fear is in every corner, and uncertainty is what governs every aspect of your breath, and risk is about taking that uncertainty and saying ‘That’s my advantage.’”
Hamilton said that he has a similar approach to risk.  “Fear of what could happen stops people from doing almost anything … but the willingness to risk and put yourself on the line and be present — that is the key.”
The speakers also talked about how taking advantage of the fears and embarrassments of daily life have made them more successful.
“The most important thing with fear is its usefulness, what you do with it and how you use it,” Hamilton said.
Daniel Park, a senior majoring in business administration, asked the speakers how they saw the light during their darkest times.
“You don’t see the light in the darkness,” Barrack said. “You see the light whenever it comes.  You need to keep taking risks and defying resistance.”
Eduardo Dillon, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering explained that this event encouraged him to learn to take risks.
“The biggest takeaway I got from this event was that you need to take risks, and it goes along with a quote that I always go by which says, ‘Living a life without risks is living the safest and slowest suicide,’” Dillon said.

For moderately priced vintage finds, American Vintage in Westwood is the place to splurge all those ’90s mom style pieces (sorry, boys). So if you’re looking for worn-in high-waist denim and slouchy cashmere sweaters, this charming shop in Westwood Village is one that might suit your fancy. Though last weekend’s 50% off sale is over until the summer season, American Vintage still boasts a quality selection of lightly worn clothing and jewelry, for prices that won’t drain your wallets.
The best of the American Vintage collection includes its dresses, filled with retro dresses ranging from ’50s pin-up styles to ’70s florals to simple black maxis we love today. Most are set at about $20, a modest price for a lot of dresses that are still in really great shape.
The rack of cashmere sweaters and cardigans is also not a section to bypass, with most also priced at $20. This is especially true even if you’re not typically a fan of thrift store shopping. Most sweaters are very simple and minimalistic, coming in dark tones like black and gray, which will complement outfits regardless of personal style. Though stocking up on pullovers and cozy knits may not be most practical, here in southern California, a warm, but light sweater goes a long way on a chilly night.
But in spite of these sweet deals, as all seasoned thrifters and bargain hunters know, good finds are not easy to come by. Finding a really special piece that you’ll love and wear for years is no easy feat. It will take a lot of looking. The first step is to have patience, because without it, the selection will be never not be overwhelming. You’ll need the time to sift through the sizes that are too big, the fabrics that are too worn, and the styles that you’re just not a fan of. If you don’t have the patience or time set out to do a little treasure hunting, a store will just look like a jumbled mess that’s been vaguely organized by garment type, and not to mention, a really exhausting experience.
Like many stores that sell vintage wares and clothing, A.V. has its own buyers, so there is always new clothing coming through its doors. As of last week there were plenty of leather and denim jackets, as well as dresses, and denim shorts. A.V. has been open for about four years and now has six stores. The Westwood store is located at 945 Broxton Avenue, in the Westwood Village. Happy thrifting!

Anne Hall, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was quoted last week in The New York Times as saying over the years, “the student [has] bec[o]me the customer who’s always right.”
To a large extent, she’s right. I came to college expecting challenging courses and I definitely heard about them — in the science and math departments. I was less than impressed by the General Education classes that were on offer. Of course, they’re interesting and certainly serve the purpose of breaking up the usual monotony of major classes, but few are academically rigorous enough to be considered college level courses. Case in point, I took a class called “Just Because it Happened to You Doesn’t Make it Interesting: The Art of Autobiography.” As long as you wrote a 7,000-word autobiography over the entire semester and did a couple of two-page book reports, you were guaranteed an A in the class.
All too often, students take GEs to get the easy A. Many students feel like they deserve to get an A in GEs regardless of whether they actually put in the work. Websites such as ratemyprofessors.com and teacher evaluations have also exacerbated the problem, as students give negative feedback when they aren’t handed easy classes. Professors are given the wrong incentives to encourage students to rate their class highly, such as making the class easier and giving out high grades.
And yet, Princeton, after almost a decade of upholding policies against grade inflation, has chosen to finally embrace it. A strict quota that put a cap at 35 percent of students who could get A’s was lifted last October when faculty voted against it. According to the Journal of Economic Perspectives, however, studies found that strict quotas increased students’ stress levels and in Wellesley College, was shown to decrease the number of students majoring in subjects with quotas by 30 percent.
Taking Princeton’s story into account, perhaps what USC needs to do is reevaluate its own policy to combat grade inflation. Instead of setting quotas, which students might see as unfair, USC should increase the difficulty of its classes, particularly for GEs and majors such as Business Administration which are typically easier. GPAs would remain low and ultimately USC’s classes would uphold the standards of higher education.
Francesca, did you ever consider that if your major (concentration classes) are hard, the ‘easy’ elective classes are meant to pad your GPA i.e. GPA-inflation? Your concentration courses, especially if you’re a STEM major, are rigorous and competitive to the point that if your “easy” gen-ed classes didn’t confer As so easily, then you’d have a 2.XX GPA. How are you going to get into grad school or impress potential employers with a lowly GPA like that? 
But I beg to differ. I took a poli-sci class here and thought it had a very unfair grade distribution. I wrote better and more articulate papers that expounded on the subject matter than my fellow students, but alas, I was given a fricken “C” in that class; not a “C+” or a “B-” but a motherfarken “C.” And because of that bitter experience, I know that gen-ed, elective classes are nothing but ice-skating contests: grades conferred arbitrarily or with bias.
I thought USC was academically rigorous, even with the “frivolous” GE classes. I didn’t walk through the raindrops by getting all the ‘easy’ professors….

When you think China, the first thing that comes to mind probably isn’t gender equality. And why should it be, when many agricultural families still prefer boys to girls, and even urban families are mainly concerned with marrying their daughter off into a good family.
So maybe I wasn’t the only one (pleasantly) surprised when I learned that half of the world’s female, self-made billionaires are Chinese. It didn’t really make sense to me at first. Having lived in Beijing for many years, I knew what my liberally conservative Chinese parents thought. Okay, so they didn’t encourage me to just marry well and pop babies out, but they sure did seem to expect other women to aim for that common goal. Oh dear, your cousin’s turning 28 this year…I told your father to set her up with someone from the news agency! If she gets any older, all the good ones will be taken already.
If that’s true, then how is this environment a conducive breeding ground for half of the world’s female billionaires? I found the answer when I took a step back and really assessed the career paths of the Chinese women in my life. That’s when it all made sense.
My grandmother grew up in a time when feet binding, a practice that physically crippled women for aesthetic purposes, was still very much the norm. But she also lived in a time when famine was rampant and both parents would have to work in order to feed their children and make ends meet.
The reason why the feminist world subtly (and sometimes, not so subtly) discourages women from prioritizing marriage as a life goal, is because of the common conception that a woman’s personal life ends after marriage. She’s much more likely to raise a family than focus on her career.
It’s not the same in China, simply because many families don’t have that luxury. Whether it’s out of financial necessity or whether it’s residual from the female equality movement in the Mao era, there’s a new current of female empowerment in modern China. Overriding the supposed “confines” of marriage, this surge of powerful women proves that it’s possible to conquer both the home and work place.
