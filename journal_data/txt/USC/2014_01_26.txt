From the end of USC’s season on Dec. 21 up until the Jan. 15 declaration deadline, we watched the Trojans’ draft-eligible juniors trickle into the pool for the 2014 NFL Draft. First it was safety Dion Bailey, then center Marcus Martin, followed by defensive end George Uko, wide receiver Marqise Lee and tight end Xavier Grimble.
The loss of star contributors always hurts, but this year it especially stings. USC is still riding out NCAA sanctions, which means those five scholarships no longer being used cannot be transferred to add to their upcoming recruiting class. USC is now, after playing with fewer than 50 healthy scholarship players for a good deal of 2013 (compared to other schools’ 85), five more men down.
You shouldn’t blame the departing players, though. A new coach in Steve Sarkisian means another year of tweaking the offense post-Matt Barkley and the Trojans are now on their third defensive coordinator in three years. The decisions were made with their best interests in mind. It’s not a lack of loyalty — it’s just business.
All of them went to USC for a shot at a career in professional football. Right now, in my opinion, is the best time for each one of them to pursue that dream. All five will be drafted, and all five have the skills to establish lengthy NFL careers.
The most surprising early entry, for me, was Martin. He missed the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl due to an injury sustained against UCLA, but it didn’t require surgery and would have allowed him to return for spring practice in March, according to reports.
Still, his resume is pro-ready. He was a Freshman All-American at guard in 2011, and was USC’s only offensive player to make First Team All-Pac-12 this year. He moved to center in 2013 and acclimated well to being the leader of the offensive line. From what we’ve heard, his injury should allow him to return in time for NFL team workouts. His versatility is a plus, and after seeing both Barkley’s and Lee’s respective draft stock fall after fighting through injury-filled junior years, Martin couldn’t be blamed for not wanting to risk re-injury in 2014.
The other perplexing decision, on the surface, is Grimble’s. His numbers went down this season compared to 2012, as former head coach Lane Kiffin’s playcalling minimalized his receiving opportunities. Under Sarkisian’s wide-open offense, one that often used two tight end sets at Washington, Grimble seemed primed for a breakout senior campaign.
Grimble is 6-foot-5 and a little over 250 lbs. — and in today’s NFL, a big tight end with great hands like Grimble makes coaches salivate. Grimble never really became a receiving threat at USC, and I can’t blame him for taking his chances and hoping to be selected by an NFL squad that can better utilize his skill set. Just look at former UCLA tight end Joseph Fauria who went undrafted last year before catching seven touchdown passes for the Detroit Lions as a short-yardage threat.
Uko, on the other hand, improved at a linear rate at USC: from a backup role in 2011 to a starter in 2012, and finally to a scary pass rush threat in 2013. Though linebacker Devon Kennard returned to school for a standout senior campaign in 2013, Uko also witnessed fellow defensive lineman Morgan Breslin’s senior season devolve into injury and disappointment. And we shouldn’t forget the loss of beloved defensive line coach Ed Orgeron, whom Uko compared to a father, forcing a third set of schemes for Uko’s third year as a starter.
Bailey was a declaration we all saw coming. He played linebacker his first two years on the field, but a move back to safety in 2013 really allowed him to shine. He was still all over the field, and displayed his ability to be the general of a secondary and show off his pass coverage skills.
Bailey is slightly undersized for a linebacker at 6 feet tall, but it won’t prevent him from going in the second or third round in May. I don’t think another year would have boosted his stock into the first round, which means now is the right time to pursue the NFL dream.
Then there’s the no-brainer. Wide receiver Marqise Lee was as dazzling as he was hesitant in 2013, a season marked by injury scares and the emergence of sophomore Nelson Agholor. His Biletnikoff-winning 2012  performance showed how such a special talent would be best-served to enter the NFL — where his elite speed and pass-catching ability would earn him millions — as soon as possible.
Lee limped through 2013, but his seven-catch, 118-yard performance against Fresno State in the season finale was vintage Marqise Lee. An up-and-down junior campaign might push his stock down a notch, but a less-than-dominant senior year could have had him tumbling out of the first round, where he’s still projected in most mock drafts. Wide receiver is an injury-prone and short-lived position where one should cash in while they still can, and Lee is doing just that.
NFL Combine performances, individual workouts and interviews will determine where the chips lie for these five come May 8. Still, the process can be a crapshoot, as a former Trojan showed us just last weekend.
Former USC cornerback Malcolm Smith was a seventh-round pick in the 2011 draft. Most players drafted that low carve out roles as special teams contributors — if they’re lucky. But Smith will forever be a part of Seattle Seahawks lore after he capitalized off Richard Sherman’s pass deflection to make the Super Bowl-clinching interception a week ago.
As Smith showed us, it’s not about when you’re drafted — it’s how you make you mark. All five of USC’s draft-eligible juniors are hoping they can do just that.

As you said, only Lee was a no-brainer.  The rest, not so much. The trend is for more and more early applicants and this will be a record year with 96 (only 73 last year). About 1/2 won’t get drafted. Many will go in later rounds than likely if they had stayed another year, and that means they sign for less money.
It used to be that you needed to be a first round pick to go early. I still think that is a good yardstick with a few exceptions when circumstances dictate. In this case, everyone but Lee is going to leave money on the table by being drafted later and may not be as ready as they think. Another year may have made all the difference. It seems like more and more juniors are being sold a bill of goods to leave early, and they are the ones who are more likely to suffer as a result. Sure there are exceptions but to base a decision on those is foolish.
However, these are all great Trojans and I wish them all the best.
Disagree with you completely on being the right call. Other than Marqise Lee, the others could have
improved their draft status by coming back for one last season. None of them including Lee were
All-Americans. Martin had only one season at Center position plus his bad injury. Bailey was lost way
too many times in coverage. Grimble could have flourished with Sarkisian’s use of Tight Ends.
Uko was good not spectacular, and definitely needs more consistency from week to week. Really shows
what kind of teammates they are to leave the others behind during a major transition of the coaching staff.

With National Signing Day 2014 less than two weeks away, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian landed his first major recruit for the 2015 class when five-star quarterback Ricky Town (Ventura, Calif./ St. Bonaventure) verbally committed to the Trojans on Saturday.
Good start · Head coach Steve Sarkisian’s 2015 recruiting class received a huge boost with the addition of highly rated quarterback Ricky Town. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Town, the No. 2-rated pocket passer –— and No. 9 overall junior prospect according to Rivals.com — decommitted from Alabama early Saturday morning and then gave his commitment to Sarkisian and the Trojans after making his second unofficial visit to USC in the evening.
He expressed his excitement in a text message to ESPN.com.
“I’m proud to be a part of the Trojan Family!” Town said. “I’ve seen many of the top programs and what they have to offer. However, when I had the chance to get on the USC campus last week and spend time with Coach Sarkisian and his staff, I knew after those meetings that USC is where I want to be. The coaches are upbeat, focused and committed to winning, and I completely believe in them. I chose USC because of the tradition, the academics and the incredible coaching staff. This is an amazing opportunity to be a part of something really special. Fight On!”
After verbally pledging to Alabama head coach Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide last August, Town had reportedly been rethinking his commitment for a number of reasons, including the departure of offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier, who left to take the same position at Michigan.
Coincidentally, Saban hired former USC head coach Lane Kiffin to be Nussmeier’s replacement.
As a Southern California native playing in USC’s backyard, Town is a huge catch for Sarkisian and the USC coaching staff as they continue to build the foundation for the 2015 recruiting class.
The 6-foot-4, 190-lb. Town also received offers to play for Arizona State, Florida State, Georgia, Texas and Miami. The highly touted recruit’s services have been in high demand, in part due to his great throwing arm and speed, unofficially recording a time of 4.6 in the 40-yard dash.
The future appears to be promising for the Trojans at the quarterback position, as Town will eventually join former Gatorade National Football Player of the Year Max Browne, who will be returning next season as a redshirt freshman. Jalen Greene, an early enrollee from the 2014 class with a dual-threat playing style, will also add to USC’s depth at the position.

The USC men’s basketball team looked like it was ready to get back to its winning ways after beating California for their first conference win of the season. Stanford had other plans.
Standout · Senior guard J.T. Terrell excited fans at the Galen Center yesterday with slam dunks and clutch three-pointers to go with his 13 points. Terrell hit a key go-ahead shot with less than eight minutes remaining. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
The Trojans and the Cardinal fought hard, but ultimately it was Stanford that left the Galen Center with a 79-71 victory in overtime.
Junior guard Byron Wesley led the Trojans (10-10, 1-6 Pac-12) with 18 points, while senior guard Pe’Shon Howard finished with 13 points, seven rebounds, six assists and seven steals. Senior guard J.T. Terrell finished with 13 points and eight rebounds, while sophomore forward Strahinja Gavrilovic scored 12 points.
Dwight Powell finished with 14 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals for the Cardinal (13-6, 4-3). Chasson Randle led Stanford with 17 points, while Josh Huestis finished with 16 points and six rebounds.
“We played very hard today and had a chance to win, and as a coach, that’s all you can ask for,” said USC head coach Andy Enfield.
The Cardinal played punishing defense right from the start, forcing the Trojans to use up the shot clock looking for chances to score. Stanford was able to start off on a 12-4 run as USC had trouble with their physicality on both sides of the ball. USC missed nine of its first 11 shots, while Stanford hit five of its first seven.
A layup from Wesley and a shot-clock violation by the Cardinal helped USC get its momentum back, leading to six unanswered points to put the Trojans right back in the game. The defense started matching Stanford’s intensity with full-court presses, causing plenty of problems for the Cardinal offense.
“We worked on it in practice,” Howard said of the full-court press. “We used it in this game to try and speed the game up. It’s just part of the game plan.”
The half was punctuated by a huge block on a fastbreak from freshman guard Julian Jacobs as the Trojans looked to keep momentum going after their rough start. The Trojans would take a 17-16 lead with 7:41 left on a steal, layup and free throw from Howard.
The two teams kept up their smothering defenses as the Trojans entered the locker room down 32-28. There were a combined 23 fouls in the first half, while USC outrebounded the Cardinal 20-18.
Powell led all scorers with 10 points at halftime.
USC jumped out on an 8-0 run to start the second half, including six points from Terrell, as the Cardinal missed their first five shots. The Cardinal countered with a 12-3 run of their own, as each team looked to secure momentum. A three-pointer by Terrell and a three-point play by senior center Omar Oraby tied the game at 49 apiece with 9:01 left.
The Trojans would take a 51-49 lead on a hookshot in the paint by Oraby a couple of possessions later, but the Cardinal would seize it back on a three-pointer by Randle and not give it back as USC was held without a field goal for more than four and a half minutes toward the end of the half.
USC was able to cut the Cardinal lead to two with 0:33 left, and, on the following inbounds pass, Stanford lost control of the ball to give USC possession with 0:29 remaining in the game. Wesley hit two free throws to tie it up at 61. Powell missed a jumper in the paint with five seconds remaining, Howard stole what was an offensive rebound by Stanford and the Trojans called timeout with :02 left for one last shot. They inbounded it to Oraby at midcourt, but a missed half-court heave sent the game into overtime.
“It was a very tough game,” Gavrilovic said. “We’ve been playing so hard all game and trying to win so bad … We came back from seven, six, and in overtime, we made mistakes.”
Stanford controlled the overtime period, jumping out to a 70-64 lead with 2:46 left and icing the game with free throws. Randle scored seven points in the overtime period to lead all scorers.
“Give Stanford credit, they went four-for-five in overtime,” Enfield said. “They hit a free throw and they hit two big threes. Give them credit because they made their shots and we came down and missed a couple layups.”
Overall, there were 10 ties and eight lead changes in the game. USC outrebounded the Cardinal 40-39 for the game, but committed 15 turnovers to Stanford’s 14. USC shot 42 percent from the floor to Stanford’s 41 percent.
The Trojans will travel to Oregon next week to take on Oregon State (11-8, 3-4) on Thursday, Jan. 30 at 6 p.m., followed by a match against Oregon (13-5, 1-5) on Sunday, Feb. 2 at 5 p.m. Both games will be broadcasted on the Pac-12 Networks.

When Bovard Administration Building was completed in 1921, the area students now know as University Park Campus looked entirely different. USC’s campus itself spanned only a few blocks.
Back to the Future · The modern USC Campus (right) began to take shape after the building of Bovard Auditorium in 1921. The side by side comparison contrasts Hahn Plaza today with its 1921 counterpart, as shown on the left, courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Stores and houses were side by side with school buildings. Tommy Trojan did not yet exist, and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum had not yet been built.
Though many students and professors think of USC as a modern university known for its diversity and cutting-edge research, this school also has a rich history.
Last month, the Los Angeles City Council named 12 campus buildings Historic Cultural Monuments. These buildings not only hold architectural significance, but also give historians a peek into the past.
Simply walking past some of these buildings hints at what attending USC would have been like for the first class of Trojans almost 134 years ago.
USC puts down roots
Construction began on the first building on campus, the Widney Alumni House, in 1880. Though the Alumni House has been moved from its original position near Founders Park, it is still used for university functions.
Soon after the first 53 students enrolled that fall, the university added a dormitory, Hodge Hall, and a building for classes, College Building. Even as the university began to grow in the early 1900s, this first iteration of campus was a fraction of the size of USC today.
USC archivist Claude Zachary explained that part of the reason USC was initially so small was that the university only used a small portion of its land grant.
“The original grant of land to the university in 1880 was for a whole big plot of land,” Zachary said. “The actual campus was a few lots right in the center of that piece and the rest of the land was basically donated with the intent that the university sell it off to fund its endowment.”
In the late 19th century, University Avenue ran through the center of campus. An electric trolley called the University Line served Exposition Park, which was then called Agriculture Park. University buildings were sprinkled among neighborhood homes and stores, blurring the lines between USC and the surrounding community.
A social center develops
Soon after the iconic façade of Bovard was erected in 1921, the modern university began to take shape.
Construction of the Coliseum was completed in 1923, and the university unveiled Tommy Trojan for its 50th anniversary in 1930.
The Gwynn Wilson Student Union, Mudd Hall of Philosophy and Physical Education Building were built in 1927, 1929 and 1930, respectively.
The Student Union created the first space that students could use for clubs, organizations and activities. The Daily Trojan and El Rodeo have had their offices in the building since it opened in 1928, and the Student Union originally housed the printing presses.
Students also used to hold dances in the Physical Education Building. The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps took over office space there in 1940, and the building still houses ROTC programs today.
Perhaps one of the most iconic buildings on campus, Doheny Memorial Library, opened in 1932. Doheny has held a significant portion of USC’s collections since then.
‘The walls of Troy’
Even after the developments of the 1920s and ’30s, the center of campus still looked little like Hahn Plaza does today.
Until the Hancock Foundation Building was constructed in 1940, “hamburger row” occupied one side of Trousdale. Students could buy hamburgers for a nickel at pop-up restaurants such as Tommy’s Place and Sunny Jim’s Feed Bag.
USC alumnus Capt. G. Allan Hancock donated the funds for the Hancock Foundation, now called the Hancock Institute for Marine Studies. In addition to marine biology classrooms and a library for Hancock’s book collection, the building included the first KUSC radio studio and the first on-campus television studio.
Zachary said that this eclectic mix of uses mirrored Hancock’s personality.
“[Hancock] was really a musician, as well as a scientist, as well as an aviator. He was an oil magnate,” Zachary said. “He was the chair of the board of trustees for many years and the friend of Rufus Von KleinSmid.”
Familiar buildings such as the Olin Hall of Engineering, Von KleinSmid Center and the University Religious Center sprung up in the 1960s. Slowly but surely, the USC of the past was morphing into a sprawling urban campus.
Zachary said former university president Norman Topping played a large role in forming the campus students recognize today.
“When Norman Topping became the university president in around 1958, he started to develop the master plan … envisioning the move out to Vermont and taking over this whole space,” Zachary said. “They started to build the walls of Troy and, for the first time, distinguish USC from the neighborhood.”
By the time construction finished on the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism building in 1979, the University Park campus had established itself as another neighborhood in South Los Angeles.

The ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at USC Libraries has recently partnered with Project Suicide Prevention Intervention Now and the Los Angeles Unified School District to create and implement lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history curricula into high school classes.
The ONE Archives currently possesses the largest LGBT archive in the world.
“I think the ONE Archives are an important place because they’re gathering history that kind of slipped through the cracks,” said Quyên Nguyen-Le, co-president of USC Queer People of Color.
The new partnership between the ONE Archives, LAUSD and Project SPIN is intended to get the LGBT history that has slipped through the cracks into history classes.
This project arose as a response to the Fair, Accurate, Inclusive and Respectful Education Act. The new bill called for the integration of factual, age-appropriate information about the contributions of members of certain minority groups, including LGBT individuals, into social studies and history lessons.
To facilitate the implementation of more inclusive history teachings mandated by the FAIR Education Act, the ONE Archives hired researchers familiar with the archives to use the history textbooks already in possession by LAUSD to integrate LGBT-specific history into the existing curriculum.
“When a teacher is teaching a certain section of a history book, our curriculum is identical to the format of theirs,” said Jamie Scot, project and development manager for the ONE Archives. “All they have to do is fold it really seamlessly and easily into what they’re already teaching.”
Representatives from the ONE Archives and from Project SPIN will also offer training sessions for teachers.
These sessions are intended to offer support for the historical material as well as sensitivity training for teachers who might be unfamiliar with certain aspects of LGBT history.
“Our partners from LAUSD and Project SPIN work together all the time and so they were very open to this resource for their teachers and very supportive of getting this in the classrooms,” Scot said.
Scot believes that by efficiently integrating more historical narratives into the standardized version of history taught in schools, this project is likely to lead to a more respectful climate toward LGBT individuals. She also thinks it will positively affect LGBT-identified students in LAUSD.
“To really be told that your community is important historically and that people from your community have been contributing to society and to history for hundreds of years, it just immediately validates you as a person and it validates you as a member of this community,” Scot said.
Troy Rayder, parliamentarian for USC’s Queer and Ally Student Assembly, is also hopeful about what this new curriculum will mean for students in the LAUSD.
“I hope that it will generally create a more appreciative environment for LGBT people,” Rayder said.
Rayder, who worked for the ONE Archives from February through August 2013, was informed that some of the work he’s done for the archives might be referenced or included in the new curriculum.
“I think that it will help people in school who may be struggling with their identity or may be struggling to come out, to hear about these inspiring figures who were LGBT and did great things in the world and were out about it,” Rayder said. “It may help them in their coming out process, so that is something that I think is awesome.”

Copyright law is about as much of a headache as anything in the U.S. legal system. When it comes to         issues of trademark and the rights to certain terms and  concepts, it inevitably gets messy. Such is the case in the current legal battle between King.com, the purveyor of games such as Candy© Crush Saga, and the indie, turn-based Role Playing Game The Banner Saga.
King.com is trying to prevent Stoic Studio, the creators of The Banner Saga, from trademarking its title because, according to King.com, it infringes on their trademark claim to the word “saga.” In addition to this, King.com has also attempted to register the trademark to the term “candy©” as it applies to any mobile game, application and even merchandise.
Understandably, the whole situation is perplexing. The two games, Candy© Crush being a derivative premium-pay puzzle game and The Banner Saga being a turn-based RPG with vikings and giants, couldn’t be more different. So the only real issue that King.com can bring up is that many of its other titles, such as Pet Rescue Saga, also feature the word “saga” in it.
Stoic Studios is in a vulnerable position because it’s a small, independent studio and King.com is a giant company with nearly a billion dollars of revenue to use the full force of the legal system to its heart’s content.
Now, this case doesn’t necessarily mean that The Banner Saga will have to change its name anytime soon. The real headache of this whole circumstance is that King.com, in an effort to stop the copious amounts of candy-related knockoffs (funny considering some folks see Candy© Crush as a knockoff of Bejeweled), has to challenge anyone using the terms to strengthen its own claim with the courts.
So far, its claim to the word “candy©” has some merit. When it comes to using a common term, a company has to prove the validity of its claim in association with its product. For example, Apple Inc. has a right to the usage of the word “apple” as it applies to computers, but not in its usage in another industry.
In this sense, King.com could argue that the association of “candy©” with its title Candy© Crush Saga describes the gameplay, aesthetic and public perception of the title. The use of the term “saga,” however, is a much grayer area. A saga is defined as a “long story of heroic achievement.” In a cruel bit of irony, the term saga is of Norse origin, so The Banner Saga is actually using it in a manner closer to its original meaning.
The word “saga” has hardly anything to do with candy or pet stores or farm heroes; in fact, it’s doubtful anyone has even referred to Candy© Crush Saga as anything other than Candy© Crush. The sad truth is that King.com is in a position to, in an effort to protect its products, go against anyone making use of the term to legitimize its claim.
It’s depressing to think that an independent studio has to be scared of using a term as common as “saga” in its title out of fear of legal retribution from a more powerful company. It’s even more depressing when you realize that a company has to take this path of challenging other companies to actually protect itself from derivative work.
As copyright/trademark laws become more convoluted and confusing, they’ll only inhibit creativity and new works to be successful. This article directly expresses that any and all uses of the “candy©” and is, confoundingly, the rightful trademark of the company King.com. The fact that this is a genuine citation probably speaks to the absurdity of the whole situation in the first place.

They have done it again; USC Hospitality has opened new restaurants on campus that will satisfy every student’s needs. Starting a healthy diet? Begin your day with Nekter’s freshly squeezed juices and açai bowls. Need something warm? The Habit can serve you a no-fuss burger that will keep you satisfied throughout the day. Hosting a club meeting or conference? Express Catering can do the trick.
“Ring” in the New Year · USC Hospitality has introduced a handful of new on-campus dining options. The Habit Burger Grill replaced Carl’s Jr. in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center food court earlier this semester. – Photo courtesy of Erika Chesley
Conveniently located between the Roski School of Fine Arts and the Architecture School, Nekter is a “better and healthier alternative to Jamba Juice,” said Kris Klinger, director of Hospitality. “When we turned the market-style food court Café 84 to a full-time restaurant, we knew that there would be some complaints from students regarding the loss of Jamba [Juice], so two years later we opened Nekter to meet their needs.”
With locations in 23 different places in Southern California, as well as a location on the UCLA campus, Nekter has expanded its freshness to USC where it offers delicious vegan and vegetarian options to give college students their essential vitamins and minerals in order to keep them healthy during times of stress and full class schedules. Nekter serves up an assortment of veggie-filled juices to help the immune system, such as  the Toxin Flush, which has parsley, spinach, apples, lemon and ginger. The fruit smoothies at Nekter are a real treat. From the Berry Banana Burst to the Chocolate Dream, Nekter creates every smoothie fresh the second you order it to provide customers with a nourishing dessert alternative.
“We want to keep enhancing healthy options on campus,” Klinger said. “The more healthy options, the merrier, and the healthier our students will be.”
The açai bowls are topped with fresh fruit and can be customized by adding gluten-free raw oat nut granola or by making a bowl a “greenie” (with kale and spinach). The shots of wheatgrass and ginger are an excellent way to get a healthy boost of energy and are quick and easy to eat, even on a busy schedule. Also on the “grab and go” menu are some healthy salads and pre-packaged juices perfect for late nights and study sessions. Nekter even gives its customers the option of ordering its juice cleanse in-store or online at Nekter’s website.
Every semester, USC Hospitality wants to change up the menu by adding a new restaurant. Recently, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center added a very popular new addition to its family, The Habit, replacing the classic Carl’s Jr. Known for its cooked-to-order burgers and exemplary service, The Habit is every student’s go-to when he or she is in the mood for something savory.
The Habit prides itself on not being like any other burger joint — to this effect, they offer an ahi tuna burger alongside a bevy of healthy chicken breast sandwiches. The sandwiches are a departure from the greasy burgers of, say,  Carl’s Jr.
“There are a few different items that we have here,” said John Phillips, vice president of Franchising at The Habit. “We have chicken sandwiches that definitely separate us from other ‘better burger’ concepts; we have a fresh breasted chicken that we slather in barbeque and teriyaki, and we also do a club sandwich with avocado and bacon on grilled sourdough [bread]. We also have the ahi tuna, that comes on a nice seeded bun, with teriyaki glaze on it.”
Burgers aren’t all that are on the menu — The Habit also has ready-to-go fresh salads and crispy sides such as onion rings and French fries as other dining options. Like the SoCal classic burger joint In-N-Out, The Habit also offers a secret menu item:  the Santa Barbara Burger.
“Our Santa Barbara Style — this is the only location that has it — comes with two patties, two slices of cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato and guacamole, all on grilled sourdough — a nice big hefty portion,” Phillips said.
Apart from students’ individual daily food needs, clubs, groups, organizations and faculty need a convenient way to get food as well. To satisfy this need, USC Hospitality reintroduces Express Catering — simple and fresh catering without the mess of servers and fancy silverware.
“With [Express Catering] we really focused on the quality and consistency, and we offer it at a price that is competitive,” said Eric Ernest, Executive Chef for USC Hospitality.
Express Catering offers everything from Krispy Kreme donuts and breakfast items to savvy, reusable boxed lunches in which customers can choose a fresh, handmade sandwich on artisan bread, fresh salad, or wrap, to go with a handmade cookie, chips, fruit and a drink.
“We are bringing in new items right now to cover the vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free, and we will have those rolling out by the end of the month,” said USC Hospitality’s Special Events and Catering’s manager, Heather Rawls. “Also, we offer themed donuts — for Halloween there will be little ghosts, goblins, bats and witches, Valentine’s Day has hearts, all green donuts for St. Patrick’s Day, Easter egg shaped for Easter and we do a monthly special on a dozen donuts and a gallon of coffee for $20.”
Since Express Catering doesn’t charge tax to students and also takes dining dollars, the opportunities to have a year-end potluck or celebrate a friend’s birthday are endless.
During the week of Jan. 27, USC will partner with the Mushroom Council for Mushroompalooza.
“Every day [this] week, there will be something mushroom-related happening on campus, where every restaurant will be doing specials,” said Erika Chesley, Associate Director of Special Events, Sales and Marketing for USC Hospitality. “We’re going to kick it off with a theme night at Café 84, [and] there will be a cooking demonstration at the farmer’s market next Wednesday.”
USC Hospitality’s goal is to promote healthy living and eating on the USC campus, as well as to start new trends. By hosting the Mushroomapalooza, they hope to make students aware of all of the benefits that mushrooms have, not only from a health standpoint, but from a flavor standpoint as well.
“Mushrooms are really high in Vitamin D, flavor, and ultimately really high in glutamine acid which is umami, and with mushrooms, you can also lower your caloric intake for that given day, but you get a lot of flavor,” Ernest said.
It seems that with USC Hospitality (and also mushrooms), anything is possible. With the help of the students, USC’s food will only get tastier, and will offer even better and more current dining options for the future.

Like most 19-year-old girls, there’s one individual on this planet who I find more groundbreaking than sliced bread and more mesmerizing than puppies during finals week: Beyoncé.
In fact, as I pound away at my keyboard in the early hours of the morning, whipping out my introductory column, it’s Queen Bey who’s blaring through my headphones — it’s lyrics such as “You wake up, flawless / Post up, flawless / Ride round in it, flawless.”
But even the Queen can make mistakes. Even though Beyoncé churns out incredible numbers that speak to the power of womanhood, she’s also wary of the word “feminist”. So wary, that she told British Vogue that the word feminist “can be very extreme.” Though she added later, “I guess I am a modern-day feminist,” her words drip with hesitation — a sure sign that Queen Bey is not as comfortable with the term as the public might want her to be.
Unfortunately, the word “feminist” evokes images of bra-burning women who hate men and label the world as one big patriarchal wreck. But take a look at Merriam-Webster, at the Oxford dictionary or any well-respected text and the word “feminism” or “feminist” boils down to this: “the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.”
It’s that simple. But why is the word “feminist” so taboo? It’s because society makes it that way. From the mass media to your average Joe, people fear its use because of its extremist connotations, so they refuse to employ it.
In reality, this word, and variations of it, pay homage to the work of Susan B. Anthony, to innovators such as Marie Curie, to gutsy leaders such as Indira Gandhi. Instead of embracing a word with such rich history, however, we shun it.
According to Noah Berlatsky, a correspondent for The Atlantic, the word connotes “a movement, a history, a faith, and a hope for change.” Excluding the term from everyday conversation means stopping a much-needed dialogue about topics such as sexual assault and female leadership.
The Guardian publishes a blog series called “Secret Teacher,” on which anonymous contributors have the opportunity to write on the tribulations of education. In one post, a contributor argues that feminism has become a “dirty word,” making it difficult to be taught in a classroom setting.
“One of the reasons why feminism has been shunned from our schools is because of the now commonplace — and highly necessary — recognition that on average girls’ academic achievement is higher than boys,” the writer asserts.
The academic achievement of girls during their time in school does not reflect the ambition gap that exists after girls complete regular schooling. In truth, too few women land high-level roles in Fortune 500 companies or go on to lead their nations. This is just one of numerous reasons why the feminist dialogue is imperative — it pushes us to think about the meaning of equality and opportunity for all.
In a contemporary context, feminists are women such as Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who seek to empower other women and break gender barriers. And of course, we cannot forget that men are a critical part of the feminist movement’s growth. Achieving gender equality requires contributions from people of both genders.
So on the off-chance that Beyoncé is reading this very column, I have hopefully helped her reconsider her perception of one of the  most dynamic words in the English language.
 
Rini Sampath is a sophomore majoring in International Relations. Her column “Leaning In” runs Mondays.
 
Feminism is bigoted, reverse-sexist, female-supremacist fascism in both ideology and application.
A well written article, however, I disagree with your final conclusion. I agree that feminism should be about equal rights and opportunities for men and women, but that does not mean we should see an equal outcome. Men and women are in fact different, something that you would probably agree with seeing how you mentioned that girls score higher than boys in standardized testing. The notion that women should be equally represented in places like political and corporate leadership therefore distorts the dictionary definition of feminism, and makes feminism and extreme viewpoint. We should give all people regardless of gender the same rights and opportunities, but we can’t enforce or expect equal the outcomes. There are many places where women are more successful than men, and vice versa, but enforcing equality limits freedom. Freedom is the equality of rights and opportunities available to all people. Equality suggests equal outcome (e.g. equal number of men and women in each job, etc.). America was built on freedom, and it’s this freedom that has made America great. 
This is a very long comment, but to wrap it up. I too hesitate to call myself a feminist. While I agree with the definition of feminism, I disagree with the notion that men an women are inherently the same, and that we should see equal outcomes. It’s this idea that has radicalized the term feminist, and is the reason why I (and probably Queen Bay) don’t like the term.
Gotta love It.  All three media references are from fascist media sources and feature fascist gender bigots.  Shunning seems like a very good idea to me.
Ah but it defines Misogyny as simply ‘The hatred of women’ which is inaccurate/incomplete. Yes it does stem from hatred but it is a complete prejudice of women….in all it’s shapes and forms….not so simply defined as hate.
Daily Trogan editors shouldn’t shun free speech.  ASU had such a great beginning but it looks like the fascists are back even in the schools administration.  Sad really but it won’t change the fate of feminism long term.

Los Angeles implemented a new ban on single-use plastic bags in the new year, and the rest of the state could be next, according to the Los Angeles Times. If California becomes the first state to ban single-use plastic bags, it will set a much-needed precedent for the rest of the nation.
Under the new bill proposed Friday, plastic bags would be prohibited in California grocery stores beginning July 1, 2015, which would eventually extend to California pharmacies and liquor stores beginning in 2016. The bill would also require Californians to pay at least 10 cents for recycled paper bags or reusable plastic bags.
This isn’t the first time that California legislators have tried to implement such a ban. Last year, California state Sen. Alex Padilla sponsored Senate Bill 405, aiming to phase out single-use plastic bags at supermarkets, liquor stores and pharmacies. Like the several attempts before this, those criticizing the bill for killing jobs and being an economic burden lobbied against it, causing the legislature to narrowly fold on the bill.
Padilla’s last attempt to pass a plastic bag ban in February 2013 was met with opposition led by Sens. Kevin De Leon and Ricardo Lara. This time, however, Padilla is working with his former opponents. The new bill, co-authored by De Leon and Padilla, reworked the previous bill to address the previous concerns of its opponents.
Under this proposal, $2 million would be set aside to retrain plastic bag industry workers so that they could begin working in recycling jobs. Moreover, it would begin requiring that reusable bags be at least 20 percent recycled (set to eventually increase to 40 percent), establishing a third-party certification of reusable bags to ensure they comply with California standards.
Plastic bag bans are already in effect in nearly 90 cities and counties in the state. With a third of Californians abiding by  the ban, it is difficult to argue that such a regulation would be impossible to enact — it’s already happening. California needs a bill that finds a balance between those concerned with the economic conditions of the state and the environmental wellbeing of the state, and this proposal does just that. Plastic bags are cost-ineffective, forcing the state to spend millions of dollars in cleaning costs and millions of barrels of oil to make these flimsy bags in the first place — money that could otherwise be spent in other areas of need, such as education.
This ban would also diminish the burden these plastic bags have on our environment. Of the billions of bags used every year by Californians, most of them end up littering the sides of our roads and the shores of our oceans. Executive Director of Californians Against Waste Mark Murray said that the bill ultimately provides a solution to this  environmental dilemma.
“This bill is going to eliminate some 20-billion single-use plastic bags that become litter,” Murray told the Los Angeles Times.
Critics of the statewide ban say the bill will burden low-income and working-class Californians who can’t afford to pay the 10-cent charge on paper bags. These criticisms, however, fail to acknowledge the fact that such a bill isn’t meant to transfer Californians’ use of plastic bags to paper bags. Rather, it’s meant to wean shoppers off using these temporary bags in the first place. Providing durable, reusable plastic bags that shoppers can use over and over (many of which cost less than a dollar) does just that.
Cities across the nation, from Washington, D.C. to Palo Alto, Calif., have placed bans on single-use plastic bags, yet no state has enacted a statewide ban. California should take this opportunity to lead the nation in a movement that has already built up so much momentum. The success of this policy has already been proven in cities nationwide.
Conclusive data shows that these bags ultimately do more harm to our environment and economy than good. It’s high time that California acknowledge it.

The government should not be dictating which bags businesses and consumers can and cannot use.  How much freedom are we willing to sacrifice so that liberals can further their many agendas?
Reusable bags from CHINA and paper bags are WORSE for the environment!!! Plus, the stores will be getting the “fine” or “tax” that comes from having to use a paper bag. None of that money goes to any environmental cause. It goes into the pockets of the wealthy. People will get sick from using bacteria-laden reusable bags from China. You think YOU might wash your bags? What about those who won’t?! These plastic bags are sanitary, cost less, have a smaller “carbon footprint” and are easier to recycle than paper or reusable totes. 
Know the FACTS before you swallow any of this “junk science” OPINION article!!!
Are free people allowed to own, or buy inanimate objects? If not, why not? Or, are we no longer a free people?
Yes, what a slippery slope. It’s not like there’s any other inanimate objects whose ownership the government regulates (like automobiles, assault rifles, etc).
SRSLY… The government is LITERALLY spying on you, and THIS is the assault on your freedom that you take issue with?
No, California should NOT impose a statewide ban on plastic bags.
Plastic bags aren’t the problem, thirty eight million people shopping every day is the problem.  Sacramento should ban shopping altogether, which would eliminate all of our environmental issues once and for all.  In fact, if our political leaders enact a law to force an exodus of all those pesky shoppers, they would be poised to place California on the forefront on the war against our environment.  Let’s back Mr. Brown and the state legislators NOW.
