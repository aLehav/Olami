Last week, I made a budget. I’m not big on financial organization (even on those rare occasions when I actually have finances to organize), but I was in the life-planning mood that morning. 
Listing out my expenses, I saw that my biggest category was entertainment — mainly going to the movies, no surprise there. I perused the websites of various theaters around the area eager for cheaper alternatives, but I found none. The best options I did find were still playing “Annabelle: Creation” and nothing new. 
So — as any sensible college student would when they stumble upon a minor inconvenience — I took my grievances to Twitter, even using the little red, angry emoji so everyone knew how serious I was. 
“Why are movies so expensive?” 
Apparently, I shouldn’t be complaining. 
In a Reader’s Digest article on this issue, Morgan Cutolo writes that it could be worse for 21st century Americans — after all, we could be 20th century Americans. In 1978, she wrote, the average movie ticket cost $2.34; adjusted for inflation, that’s  35 cents more than today’s average price ($9.11). That’s not very pacifying. Also, there were better movies coming out in the ’70s, so it balances out. I’d definitely give up 50 cents more to see “Grease,” “National Lampoon’s Animal House” or “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” These days, I’m paying almost $20 to see expressionless lions reenact Hamlet (again, but worse).
I still shouldn’t be complaining though, because apparently things aren’t as bad in Los Angeles as they are in other major cities. According to a 2018 Variety article, a movie ticket to the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square theater in London costs about $50. Terrifying. In New York, $26; in Paris, $17.25 and in L.A, $21.99 — in my own experience that last number is between $15 and $20. Still terrifying. 
But scroll down the list, and you’ll see that Rome, Beijing and Mexico City are all within the $10 price point. One of the many beautiful things about El Salvador, my motherland, is that a ticket costs $5 — and a ticket on Wednesday costs $2.25, a two-for-one deal every Wednesday. It’s heaven.
Cutolo tries to justify our bizarre U.S. prices with one central argument: Theaters are competing with streaming services, so new-and-improved amenities to gain more attraction cost money, and those costs trickle down to us. This makes sense, but, to be blunt — and I hope I speak for more than just myself — just give me a seat in a dark room with a screen bigger than my TV, some popcorn and a tasty beverage, and you’ve got yourself a weekly customer. 
Think about it. We don’t need anything extra in our theaters except a good movie. We don’t even need the now-ubiquitous reclinable seats — the point is to not feel at home, but, to be transported. If that makes you uncomfortable, good. 
And the problem isn’t ultimately how cozy theaters are, it’s what they’re showing. Every fancy amenity, every perfectly popped popcorn kernel is just a safety net in case the movies aren’t good, and we won’t want to come back. We complain about how studios incessantly spout sequels and reboots and nothing original. But, who can blame them? People want to feel comfortable; they want to watch something they already know. Suspense, uncertainty — you know, the magical things movies are made of — are uncomfortable. So where then is the real problem? Could it be that it’s not the reclining seats but the people sitting in them?
Every movie has a character, and every character has a desire — the plot revolves around this desire by either bringing the character closer or pushing them away from it. If all the world’s a screen, who are the players? The plot of our own lives revolves around our desires. It’s because we want success, love or power that we pursue the things we do. So anything that is selling itself intends to appeal to these (almost) universal desires. If they can give us what we want, we’ll pay good money plus tax. 
Perhaps I’m grasping at air. Maybe it’s just not our fault that only mediocre films are being produced and theater tickets are skyrocketing. Studios should just suck it up and make good movies, right? Yes. But, we should do something too — namely, be critical of the films we watch; demand something more, something entertaining but also meaningful. If we’re giving so much money to the movie machine, we have the right to rage against it.

Opening with their rendition of “Spongebob Squarepants” “I’m Ready” clip, the AJR trio had the crowd on its feet and bouncing almost instantly. The brother-band held nothing back Thursday as it stepped onstage to a sold-out crowd at the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall and created nothing less than a feel-good, sing-along narrative.
The high-energy Adam, Jack and Ryan Met kicked off their eighth career tour earlier in the week. Los Angeles was just their second stop. The Neotheater World Tour continues through Dec. 14, with concerts in New York, Amsterdam and London.
The band’s musical endeavors began in 2006. They wrote, produced and mixed their own content in their living room. Their third album “Neotheater” debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, with “100 Bad Days” drawing attention from Taylor Swift, Jimmy Kimmel and even Billboard. Ryan and Jack both attend Columbia University as undergraduates, and Adam is a doctoral candidate studying international human rights law at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom and just completed a year-long fellowship at Columbia.
Oregon native Tessa Violet opened for AJR just 40 minutes before releasing her newest single “Games.” Describing herself as “alt pop,” the 29-year-old has been creating music for the past six years after ending her career as a YouTube vlogger. There’s no denying Violet’s visual presence with her bright yellow bob and orange jumpsuit, commanding the attention of everyone in the venue.
Following Violet’s eclectic performance, the audience was greeted by smoke cannons and numerous cryptic messages projected onto the screen onstage. The stage went black, and suddenly, an intricate fusion of drums, flashy visuals and AJR’s signature trumpet sounded loud and proud to fill the venue.
From beginning to end, AJR’s eccentricity kept the crowd engaged and energized. Each of the band members brought their own quirks to the performance: Jack’s signature fur aviator hat, Ryan’s “penguin walk” across the stage and Adam’s short but amusing comments. The brothers were firecrackers, jumping, bouncing and crackling their voices to the beat of the music. It’s a miracle that lead singer Jack was able to stay perfectly on pitch while waving his arms around like a madman, high-kicking left and right.
The talent and lack of timidity could not have shined brighter as the band started off with some of its older hits, “Sober Up” and “Weak,” carrying the vibrancy through their transition to the acoustic performances of “Netflix Trip” and “Dear Winter.” The brothers even took a short break while their trumpeter, JJ Kirkpatrick, strutted on a treadmill, playing excerpts from the band’s most popular tracks.
AJR commanded the room, constantly engaging the audience with a visual-heavy performance. Inspired by timeless cartoons and adolescence, the brothers captured the attention of every age group in attendance. In one of the performance’s more memorable visuals, the crowd was taken back in time to the band’s early days in Washington Square Park — where the brothers used to perform covers for tips — and forward to a futuristic universe it dreamed up, never straying far from the brothers’ roots.
Despite being 13-year veterans in the music industry, transparency and genuity seem to still be a priority for the brothers. They spoke freely about their production process  — which still happens exclusively in their living rooms — and never becoming tired and repetitive in their staging. 
For its encore, the band closed with “100 Bad Days,” complete with sparklers, flashing lights and smoke machines. The extended rendition lasted for over five minutes of chaotic, ridiculous, unbothered dancing and smiling. The brothers’ ability to retain such high energy throughout the hour and a half long set, without ever wavering, is a testament to the strength of the band’s fanbase as well as their own performance skills.
AJR addresses the modern day musical aim of combatting the mental blocks and insecurities that inhibit people from having a happier life. The music is unique: No song’s lyrical or musical components decline but remain continuously buoyant. That type of positivity is rare. 
The brothers united the crowd as if it were a dysfunctional family, lifting it up while simultaneously engaging in playful banter. The Mets are extraordinary examples of creativity, authenticity and talent. Their ability to create upbeat music commenting on social norms and coming-of-age is phenomenal, but what really makes them special is their knack for not just performing, but also creating a full experience for fans.

USC Residential Education announced at the beginning of this semester that it will offer bins of free feminine hygiene products in residential colleges. The program, which is currently being piloted at Cowlings and Ilium Residential College, began at the start of the semester.
Since a free condom initiative 8 for residential colleges received positive feedback from students, resident assistants and members of Residential Education proposed providing feminine hygiene products for free in residence halls.
“I felt like this would be implemented because if we are giving away free condoms, why not feminine products?” said Cowlings and Ilium resident assistant Emily Mota. 
Residential Education, in partnership with the Office for Health Promotion Strategy, has supplied condom buckets to resident assistants. This program, which is in its second year, influenced the creation of a free feminine hygiene product pilot. 
Poori Jareankitja, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said the program will allow students to have access to feminine hygiene products regardless of cost.
“Pads and tampons are really expensive, and a lot of people don’t view it as a necessity even though it should be,” Jareankitja said. “I think that would be a huge weight lifted off of the women students here.”   
Standard-size feminine products at retail stores near campus, such as the Target at USC Village, cost anywhere between $3 and $10. Mota said these prices are steep for students who struggle financially. 
The pilot has been met with enthusiasm by students, and it is still in the process of being implemented in more residential colleges on campus. 
“In terms of free feminine hygiene products, I am aware that conversations are happening on a larger scale, but I have not heard the final decision,” Sandoval said. 
The free condom initiative, which is similar to the feminine hygiene product pilot, has been successful in providing free and accessible resources for students. 
“I think it’s going to be less of a hassle for students to get condoms and may eliminate the financial burden that some students face buying contraception,” said Ethan Saber, a sophomore majoring in political science. “I hope it leads to safer sex.” 
Jade Crenian, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, said the success of the condom program can help influence the feminine hygiene one.
“I’m totally for it,” Crenian said. “I think they should absolutely put period products into residence halls. They do it with condoms, so why not? It would just make everyone’s life probably easier.”
Many female students feel strongly about the pilot program and hope that it will expand to other residential colleges soon. 
“I think it’s really good, as long as they are sanitary … a lot of the times when you go out to restaurants and you try to get those 25-cent ones, nobody has coins, ever, so you have to end up asking people for it,” said Sunvriti Khanna, a sophomore majoring in communication. 
While Jareankitja believes that the pilot could be helpful, he acknowledges that the steep cost of feminine products will incentivize people to take advantage of the free pilot program. He believes this may lead to some complications with resource availability.
“I think it would be costly, I feel like people would have stock pile on it,” he said. “Maybe supply would be limited to only a few people. So maybe a better distribution system, like someone has to monitor it.” 
The discussion about providing students with free resources has led students and resident assistants to suggest more products, such as toilet paper, be made available to students. 
“I definitely hope that this would lead to just more resources being given here at USC,” Mota said. “I know they have a vending machine in the Starbucks area at Café 84 with cheaper alternatives for Plan B and other stuff like that. Maybe having more of that, just creating a space where students can not have to worry about basics.”

The School of Cinematic Arts will talk with students in the coming days about how to address the school’s exhibit honoring controversial film star John Wayne, Interim Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Evan Hughes wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Sunday.
The decision follows a protest Friday in which two students held up a banner in front of the SCA asking for the removal of The Wayne Collection and accusing the school of “endorsing white supremacy” for honoring the actor.
“Our values as an inclusive community are predicated on the idea that our student population needs to be heard and have a say about our SCA environment, especially when information comes to light that changes how we relate to it,” Hughes said.
Eric Plant, a junior majoring in fine arts, said they created the banner because of Wayne’s controversial stances and portrayal of Native Americans in film. The banner calls Wayne “a blatant racist” and states that the actor promoted the genocide of indigenous Americans in his films.
“By keeping Wayne’s legacy alive, SCA is endorsing white supremacy,” the banner read.
Wayne attended and played football for USC before becoming an actor but is controversial for his stance on the treatment of people of color and indigenous people throughout history.
The Wayne Collection exhibit, which features a statue of Wayne along with several of his personal items in glass cases, was dedicated in June 2012. The collection contains a variety of Wayne film posters, memorabilia, awards and letters.    
“I’m going to go every minute that I have and stand there,” Plant said. “I had conversations while I was standing there, and I was getting people to support it. I would like to keep being there and keep having a presence there.”
Plant said they hope to create larger banners and rally people to protest in front of SCA.
“If we can get enough students and if we can get enough faculty to say that this exhibit bothers them, they either have to take the choice of the people that they’re supposed to be representing, or they take the choice of John Wayne and all that terrible white supremacy,” Plant said. 
Plant cited a 1971 Playboy interview with John Wayne in which the star expressed support for white supremacy and the removal of indigenous Americans from their land when discussing their reason for protesting the exhibit.
“I believe in white supremacy,” Wayne said during the 1971 interview, which resurfaced earlier this year. “We can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the Blacks.” 
Later in the interview, Wayne said that he didn’t feel bad for the treatment of indigenous people throughout America’s history.
“I don’t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them,” Wayne said then. “Our so-called stealing of this country from them was a matter of survival.  There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.” 
Plant said they had been working with the Diversity and Inclusion Office at SCA to get the exhibit removed, but believe that protesting will be the most effective means of creating change. SCA has hosted multiple events related to Wayne, and during a 2008 celebration for what would have been his 100th birthday, the school organized an event called “John Wayne: Actor, Star, Icon, Trojan.”
Plant added that SCA removed nine items from the exhibit in an attempt to more accurately reflect Wayne’s legacy, but Plant believes the exhibit is still problematic. 
“When you walk through and see a statue, or you walk through an exhibit of glass cases, you have this sense that this person is important and that this person is this heroic stamp,” they said.
According to Plant, the SCA Diversity and Inclusion Board suggested placing a plaque in the exhibit in order to contextualize and critique Wayne’s legacy. But some students feel that this action does not go far enough to address the injustice.
“That’s not enough,” said Saul Singleton, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production. “I feel like SCA’s trying to give a quick solution that won’t resolve the problem by putting a small section of indigenous point of view.”

The No. 3 USC women’s soccer team fell to No. 2 Stanford Saturday at home in a tight 3-2 battle for its first loss of the season. The Trojans are now 7-1-1 on the year. 
The loss will set USC back in the hunt for its first outright Pac-12 title, while Stanford will have a headstart in taking the conference crown for the fifth year in a row. 
All of the scoring was concentrated in the first half of the match. The Cardinal struck first after junior forward Madison Haley headed in a long free kick by junior forward Catarina Macario. 
USC tied it up just six minutes later thanks to the partnership of junior forward Tara McKeown and sophomore forward Penelope Hocking, which the Trojans have relied on all season. Hocking slid the ball in perfect position for McKeown to fire it into the back of the net off one touch.
The goal put McKeown back at the top of USC’s season leaderboard, but her position alone there was short-lived. Hocking tallied a goal of her own off a pass from graduate defender Natalie Ward just two minutes later to tie her teammate with 8 goals.
However, after Hocking’s goal USC was stymied by Stanford’s defense for the rest of the game — and the Trojans’ 2-1 lead quickly evaporated. Macario scored the equalizer after dribbling through USC’s defense four minutes later. She notched the eventual game winner to close out the first half on a shot that bounced off the left post and in. 
The second half was like a whole new game, and the scoring was over. 
“I think both teams were a little fatigued by the time the game ended,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine of the dropoff in action during the second half.  
Although the final score indicated a close game, Stanford dominated statistically throughout the match. The Trojans had trouble dealing with Macario as sophomore goalkeeper Anna Smith faced 26 shots and was forced to make eight saves in the game.
The Trojans also notched 20 fouls while Stanford had only 10, and USC also received three yellow cards in the second half. Meanwhile, the Trojan offense only got off six shots — their lowest total of the year — with only three shots on goal.  
“In every position of the field they’ve got quality,” McAlpine said of the Cardinal. “They have  a chemistry about them that’s very good and when you have that is difficult to break down and difficult to deal with.” 
For Stanford, the win is proof that its loss to unranked Pepperdine was a fluke and that it is still the powerhouse it was to start out the season. As for USC, the team is likely to drop a few spots in the rankings, and each Pac-12 matchup from now on will carry extra significance because it can’t afford to lose many more games.  
The bright spot for the Trojans, as has often been the case, was the continued success of Hocking and McKeown. Their two scores in the first half were vital in keeping USC in the game, but they were unable to pull another one out of the bag during the second half.  
“It’s an opportunity for us to really check ourselves … and figuring out how to be a little bit better in terms of the small moments in the game that could’ve changed the game,” McAlpine said. “We played a little bit frantically.”
USC will now play two more tough Pac-12 opponents as it travels to Arizona to play Arizona State Thursday and Arizona three days later. Both teams are quietly having solid seasons, and those games will be must-wins for the Trojans if they want to keep their Pac-12 hopes in strong position.

Sometime within the last five years, skin care became synonymous with self-care. Before then, it was simply an activity. I waged the typical teenage war on my blemishes with Bioré blackhead strips and Neutrogena pink grapefruit face washes. 
Now, skin care is a bonafide lifestyle. I have a meticulous routine optimized for the best results. Gone are the days of selecting my face washes based on their brightly-colored logos or celebrity endorsements. Now, I know my alpha hydroxy acids from my ascorbic acids, and I pick out my face washes based on careful research, celebrity endorsements be damned. 
Inevitably, the amount of time — and money … oh so much money — I spend on skin care triggers a process of self-reflection. Because I simply can’t accept that I put all this time and money into my own vanity, I look at it as something else: self-care. I’m caring for myself! I’m giving my skin the TLC it deserves after a long week!
I’m certainly not alone in this thinking. Look no further than Reddit, the self-proclaimed front page of the internet, where the subreddit “r/SkincareAddiction” has an impressive 1 million members who obsessively mine each other for information as they pursue the ultimate fantasy: radiant, poreless and perfect skin. This unachievable luminosity is big business. Within the last year, sales of skin-care products doubled. 
From The Cut to The New Yorker, many news outlets have attempted to demystify the sudden popularity of skin care as self-care, with The New Yorker declaring 2017 as “The Year that Skin Care Became A Coping Mechanism” and The Cut unpacking the performativity of the simple sheet mask. 
Without a doubt, aspects of skin care do function as an important part of self-care. After all, our skin is our largest organ. It deserves some attention! When I look my best, I certainly feel more confident and happy. Moreover, doctors have identified mental benefits that arise from the sense of control offered by the routine of skin care, and one survey found that 15% of women use skin care to relax.
But a problem arises when a cheap sheet mask becomes the pinnacle of self-care culture. Sure, moisturizing is good. Great, even! But not when it becomes a crutch. You can’t depend on a sheet mask to fix a bad lifestyle. That is to say: Putting a little more effort into one’s skin does not replace the real work necessary to self-care. 
That work could be anything — daily exercise, meditation, a balanced diet or therapy sessions — but the point is that self-care is work, not a healing clay mask someone can put on and wash off ten minutes later. Rather than throwing on a sheet mask to escape the stress of daily life, self-care is about building a life that you don’t constantly need to escape from. 
Everyone gets stressed sometimes. Everyone needs a little consumerist escape. But why has skin care become a hallmark of millennial culture specifically? To put it plainly, this is an especially stressed-out generation. A 2019 study in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology found astonishing increases in rates of depression and suicidal behavior among millennials and their younger counterparts, Generation Z, with social media being one possible contributing factor.
I have no way of comparing my experiences to those of my parents’ or grandparents’ generations, but anecdotally, I can confirm my generation’s reputation for stress. We grew up with the Great Recession, making the stark realities of economic downturns especially clear to us. As adults, headlines admonish us for killing whichever industry or product of the week, while also promising us that we will have no social security to look forward to — that is, if climate change doesn’t swamp us first. Meanwhile, our faith in our political institutions deteriorates with each new scandal and with the startling inaction of our elected officials. 
All of this is amplified by the torture chamber of social media and the 24-hour news cycle that traps us, something earlier generations certainly did not have to contend with. Who wouldn’t yearn for some semblance of control, even just over one’s pores, among all this chaos?
To evoke Freud, maybe the cigar is just a cigar. Maybe that sheet mask is just a convenient mode for a daily dose of moisture. Or maybe it is a crutch, a way for us to play at self-care without actually committing to the process of self-reflection that it necessitates. 
Maybe the perfect storm of social media and our especially stressed-out generation has given rise to a megamarket that promises us control over our physical exterior, if nothing else. I, for one, will continue to enjoy the relaxation of my weekly skin-care routine — just not at the expense of the legitimate work of self-care.

Just a short distance from USC sits Staples Center, a stadium for concerts, conventions and professional basketball games. The venue holds just over 20,000 fans — enough space to fit all undergraduates at USC — with rows of seats packed with people elbow-to-elbow. 
Imagining the vast number of people it takes to fill the Staples Center makes it even more astounding that every year, around 20,000 people are trafficked into the United States, according to The Women’s Center.
Human trafficking refers to the illegal transportation and trade of people, often for forced labor or sexual slavery. People may have an understanding of what constitutes human trafficking, but often they picture it occurring in faraway places and have no idea how to solve it. 
California ranks as one of the worst states in the nation for human trafficking, and Los Angeles ranks as one of the worst cities. This past January demonstrated that fact when a human trafficking bust in California led to the rescue of dozens of victims and the arrests of hundreds of perpetrators. 
The prevalence of human trafficking within the community we live and attend school in makes USC’s lack of courses to educate its students on the problem all the more baffling. 
Admittedly, at least one school within USC has made a strong effort to educate the student body and surrounding community. The USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work organized a panel of human trafficking survivors to talk about their experiences, looked at the root causes of human trafficking and reported tips on how to recognize it. 
But the School of Social Work is a graduate institution. So, while it has done a commendable job at highlighting the problem by offering solutions, it lacks widespread reach across the entire student body, thus leaving the undergraduate population unaware of the rampant problem and without the resources that could affect change. 
For these reasons, USC should offer a course that informs undergraduate students about human trafficking within the surrounding community.
In Fall 2017, USC offered Sociology 402, a class titled “Human Trafficking” that looked at what human trafficking means, its ideological foundations and its political issues. However, the class had five prerequisite courses. Although this class was a step in the right direction, as an upper division course, it narrowed the pool of students who could take it, thereby limiting its impact. Additionally, only 17 seats were opened for the course, adding another obstacle in taking the class. 
As of now, all the research at USC on human trafficking targets graduate students studying social work, which assumes that the only time undergraduates should learn about the issue is later in life when they choose to specialize in it.
Studying social work in graduate school should not be the only avenue for students to learn about this issue. College courses should expose students to new things and ideas, regardless of major. 
With this in mind, USC should create a general education course centered upon the foundations of human trafficking and the ways a student can help in the fight to end it. As a GE, a course about human trafficking would easily fulfill the social analysis requirement that is already in place. The “C” requirement delves into social analysis and currently consists of classes such as “Race and Class in Los Angeles” and “Citizenship and Public Ethics.”  A class about human trafficking would fit the curriculum. 
Offering  human trafficking as a lower division course would allow anyone who needs to fulfill the GE requirement or take elective courses to take it. This heightens awareness of the issue, which is extremely important in the fight to end human trafficking. 
USC tends to become a little bubble within the greater L.A. area, making it all the more important for students to learn about the problems at their doorstep. The prevalence of human trafficking is both startling and disheartening, making it all the more important to understand. 
If you wish to learn more about human trafficking and how to help, text “HELP” to 233733, or call 1-888-373-7888 to report human trafficking to the national hotline.

What plagued USC football throughout a dismal 5-7 campaign a year ago was discipline. No team in the country saw more talented players miss so many assignments, pick up so many penalties and set their team back with so many boneheaded mistakes.
There was cornerback Iman Marshall’s unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that sealed a loss to Cal. 
There was quarterback JT Daniels’ horrible decision to throw deep on a fourth-quarter interception against UCLA, a game in which Bruin running back Joshua Kelley ran practically unabated for 289 yards and two touchdowns as defenders missed tackle after tackle and assignment after assignment. 
There was wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown’s fumble at the opposing 15-yard line against Notre Dame just before the half, giving the Irish all the momentum in a tightly-contested game. 
Every time, you could either feel the mistake coming or knew that it spelled doom for the Trojans’ chances in that game. Often, it was both.
It was a problem I thought had been addressed at least a little this season. Through four games, the defensive line’s stinginess was one of the Trojans’ highlights, and the offensive line was doing a much better job. Sure, there were some conduct penalties, but one of them (redshirt freshman tailback Markese Stepp dapping up Reggie Bush after a game-sealing touchdown run against then-No. 10 Utah) was pretty great, and the team seemed to feed off the emotion that drew those flags rather than letting them derail its progress. As the defense flew around and the offense decimated defenders through the air in victories over Stanford and Utah, I kept waiting for the telltale flags and miscues that always seemed destined to sink this team. They never came. Even the BYU game was more about the Cougars’ game plan than USC’s errors. 
That is, until USC went to Seattle to face No. 17 Washington Saturday. The Trojans lost 28-14 as third-string redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink threw three interceptions in his first collegiate start, but the game was closer than the final score indicated. USC had a lot of chances in the second half to pull even with the Huskies but fell into the same bad habits that afflicted it in 2018.
The biggest swing in momentum came in the third quarter after a long run from junior tailback Stephen Carr helped move the Trojans inside the Washington 11-yard line. Fink dropped back and targeted senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. on a slant, never seeing junior defensive back Elijah Molden dropping into coverage. Two plays later, multiple Trojan defenders over-pursued on a run play, allowing junior tailback Salvon Ahmed to sprint 89 yards untouched for a score that put Washington up 28-7.
There is no possible excuse for USC overcommitting on a back as explosive as Ahmed. Some might say Fink’s interception can be chalked up to the inexperience and inability of a third-stringer, which would make sense if Daniels and freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis hadn’t made almost identical bad decisions against Fresno State and BYU, respectively. Missing underneath defenders has been a trend in the Trojans’ otherwise successful passing game this season, and with three different quarterbacks displaying issues with it, it can only be attributed to poor coaching.
On that topic, offensive coordinator Graham Harrell faces some questions for his play-calling on USC’s last truly threatening drive of the game. With 6:29 remaining, USC had first-and-goal inside the Washington 10 and had a chance to make things interesting with a score and a stop. USC ran three straight times before Harrell called for a corner route to freshman wide receiver Drake London at the back corner of the end zone, hardly the ideal route or target against such a deep secondary and with a bevy of proven pass-catchers. 
USC also missed out on a scoring opportunity after freshman cornerback Chris Steele recovered a fumble in Washington territory early in the fourth quarter. USC had needed a spark, something to break the cycle of incompetence its offense had displayed for most of the game, and this appeared to be it … until St. Brown picked up an offensive pass interference penalty for blocking downfield, setting the Trojans up for a glum three-and-out.
The Trojans’ effort was littered with these ill-timed mistakes. The team had eight penalties for 80 yards, many of which came in the form of false starts on the offensive line, which had been surprisingly solid to open the season. The crowd noise at a rollicking Husky Stadium gave the unit fits; at one point, redshirt senior offensive tackle Drew Richmond, a repeat offender Saturday, got so frustrated after one of his false starts that he yelled at Fink even though the quarterback was using claps rather than his voice to start the play.
Richmond’s outburst reflected the feelings of many USC fans during the last year and a half. Despite some of its issues in recruiting, the program still has too much talent to lose the games it does. The most frustrating part of Saturday’s loss was that it was a winnable game, and yet anyone familiar with this team could feel pretty much from kickoff that the Trojans would do everything they could to shoot themselves in the foot.
It has been clear for a while now that the team needs a culture change, and it appears a pivot to Harrell’s Air Raid offense is not enough. Head coach Clay Helton has had well over a year to fix the discipline issues that have cost the program not only wins, but its reputation. 
It’s time to find someone who can restore a culture of accountability at USC.
