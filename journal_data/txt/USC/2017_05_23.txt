USC women’s lacrosse fell short in a tough NCAA quarterfinal matchup against Boston College on Saturday, losing 20-14 in Newton, Mass. Despite travelling to New England riding a 11-game win streak, the No. 7 Trojans were unable to advance to the semifinals for the second year in a row. The No. 14 Eagles were able to figure out USC’s defense, which up until Saturday had been one of the best in the country, and for the first time all season, USC gave up 20 goals, getting outshot 38-25.
The Trojans started the game slow, giving up three unanswered goals in the first seven minutes. Senior attacker Drew Jackson finally opened up the scoring for USC close to 10 minutes into the first half with her 25th goal of the season. But the Trojans slipped further behind as the half progressed, finding themselves down by five goals with about 10 minutes to go until the break.
Coming out of the locker room trailing 10-5, freshman midfielder Kaeli Huff and senior attacker Cynthia Del Core each scored to trim the deficit to 3 less than two minutes after the second-half restart. But the Eagles’ offense could not be stopped, countering with three goals of its own. After exchanging goals, USC found itself three goals behind at 15-12, but that was the closest the Trojans would get. BC extended its lead with goals from junior attackers Kaileen Hart and Kenzie Kent.
Senior attacker Michaela Michael brought the Trojans closer with a goal to make it 18-14, but the Eagles iced the game with goals from senior attacker Kate Weeks and freshman midfielder Sam Apuzzo, sending the Trojans home with a 20-14 loss. USC is now 0-3 all time against BC, and head coach Lindsey Munday’s squad has yet to make it to the Final Four in the program’s short, five-year history. 
For USC, Jackson and Del Core finished the day with hat tricks, while freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller, Huff and senior attacker Gabby McMahon notched two goals apiece. Michael, the Trojans’ all-time leading goal scorer, was held off the score sheet until the final five minutes of the second half. Junior goalie Gussie Johns finished the day with eight saves, two ground balls and one turnover. 
Weeks was the catalyst for the Eagles’ offense on Saturday, leading the team with 9 points (three goals and six assists). In addition to Weeks, four other BC players contributed at least four points. Kent scored six goals, while Hart and senior attacker Kayla O’Connor each recorded hat tricks. 
Despite the disappointing loss, the Trojans finished the 2017 season with a program-best 18 wins, and in just half a decade of existence, the women’s lacrosse program has emerged as a contender in the MPSF and beyond. Eight seniors played in their final game as Trojans, including all-time points leader Michael, but the class of 2017 leaves the team stronger than they found it, boasting back-to-back conference championships. While USC has found immense success in the regular season in the past couple of seasons, Munday and company will look to take the next step in 2018.

After finally ending a nine-game losing skid in a 14-9 win over Oregon on Saturday, USC will look to finish the season on a high note in the baseball team’s final series of the season against Washington.
When USC defeated No. 1 Oregon State in a 10-inning thriller back in April after losing seven of its last eight games, it looked as though the Trojans might be able to turn their season around. The opposite occurred, however, as the team went on to lose three consecutive series to conference foes UCLA, Utah and Oregon. Sitting at 20-31 overall and in the Pac-12 basement before Tuesday’s contest against UC Santa Barbara, USC’s three-game set against Washington this weekend is an opportunity to salvage some momentum heading into next season.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, this weekend’s games will not take place at Dedeaux Field, where the team has gone a solid, if unspectacular, 14-14. Instead, head coach Dan Hubbs and his squad will travel to Seattle carrying a dismal 5-17 record on the road this season. 
Like the Trojans, the 26-25 Huskies have experienced their fair share of struggles this season. They are currently tied with UCLA for the Pac-12’s worst team batting average at .257. They have also recorded the second-fewest RBIs. In many ways, Washington is the polar opposite of USC, which has struggled to find consistency on the mound all spring. Washington has the fourth-best team ERA in the conference, with star pitchers Joe DeMers and Noah Bremer both allowing fewer than three earned runs per game.
In contrast, the USC’s bullpen never quite found its footing this year. The Trojan relief corps have given up the most home runs (40) and hold the second-highest ERA (5.44) in the Pac-12. The young pitching staff has had a tendency to let events snowball, leading to lopsided, taxing games — such as a 13-0 loss to UCLA in early May. Only one Trojan hurler, sophomore Quentin Longrie, sported an ERA under four heading into Tuesday night. 
Given the two teams’ varying strengths and weaknesses, this weekend’s series should be a competitive one. The Huskies’ excellent bullpen will have to face several hot bats in the USC lineup, including junior Frankie Rios (team-best .354 average), sophomore Brandon Perez (.326, 22 RBIs) and sophomore Lars Nootbaar (five home runs and 30 RBIs). 
If the Trojans are able to best the Huskies in these next three contests, it would be the team’s first Pac-12 series win since late March, when they won two out of three games against Arizona State at home. Since then, USC has won just six of its last 29 games. Conversely, the Huskies have captured two of their previous four conference series, entering the weekend series with more momentum than the struggling Trojans.
Because the Pac-12 does not hold a conference tournament like most major conferences, these games will almost certainly be the last of the season for both Washington and USC. The two programs will hope to finish out strong and look to rebound from disappointing 2017 campaigns next year. 
The talent isn’t there to make a significant improvement next year.  And the coaching is woeful to say the least.  There is talk that next year’s recruiting class is strong, but wait until the MLB clubs pick and choose.  After the MLB draft we will be left with slim pickings.  The talent isn’t there which is on the coaching staff.  Player development is obviously horrible because we got worse as the season progressed.  Mr. Swann, find a good budget and get a new staff to right this sinking ship.
The Trojans need to hire a new coaching staff once this disastrous season ends on Sunday. Got killed vs. UCSB on Tuesday.
It hurts to say this is just a poorly coached team lacking in fundamentals with a wild and woeful pitching staff. One National
Title in almost 40. years , but they did make the CWS a couple of times in the early 2K. Now headed in a free fall out of the
national scene.

The No. 2 ranked men’s golf team clinched its 11th consecutive trip to the NCAA Championships last Wednesday, finishing first in the Regional Championship in Sammamish, Wash.
The Trojans topped a field of 14 teams, including some within the top 25, such as Kent State, Texas A&M and Florida State, and Pac-12 rival Washington who hosted the regional championship. USC finished the three-day competition at a combined 3-under 849, edging second-place Kent State by six strokes.
Head coach Chris Zambri and his squad started strong out of the gate, ending the first day of play in second place (-4). Junior Sean Crocker highlighted Monday’s action, shooting a career-best 7-under to lead the Trojans. Sophomore Justin Suh also posted a strong score of 3-under, to position his team just two strokes back of FSU heading into Tuesday.
USC then leapfrogged the Seminoles on day two. Suh paced the Trojans with another 3-under 71 round, while senior Rico Hoey carded his second straight 70. Junior Jonah Texeira opened his round with five consecutive birdies and moved to 5-under with another at the 10th hole. But Texeira labored to the finish line, shooting 6-over across the remaining eight holes. His 1-over round was his best of the week, helping the Trojans build a three-stroke lead over Florida State before the final day of the Regional Championship.
Hoey stayed in his groove on Wednesday, with yet another 1-under day, while Sean Crocker shot an even 71. The two strong performances cushioned Suh’s sole over-par round in Sammamish, as the sophomore carded a 73 to wrap up his week. The trio of Hoey, Suh and Crocker all finished in the overall individual top-five: Crocker and Suh were tied for second at 4-under, and Hoey, just one stroke behind the duo, tied for fifth. Freshman Cheng Jin finished tied for 39th at 10-over 223, and Texeira tied for 47th at 14-over.
“This week is always somewhat stressful,” said Zambri, who has led the Trojans beyond the regional every year since taking the reins of his alma mater in 2007. “We’re very happy it turned out how it did. Now we need to get ourselves ready for a big week in Chicago.”
The Regional Championship marked USC’s fifth win of the season — the team’s highest total since 2008. The program’s run of eleven straight NCAA Championship berths are tied for the national lead with Texas, who also secured a spot in Sugar Grove, Ill. last week with a second-place finish in their home-course regional in Austin.
The Trojans now begin the pursuit of their first-ever national championship in earnest. After coming agonizingly close with a second-place finish in 2015, and a semifinal exit last season, USC will look to put all the pieces together in 2017. The NCAA Championships begin on Friday at Rich Harvest Farms with stroke play. The Trojans hope to find themselves playing well into next week, as match play begins between the top eight teams on Tuesday.

On-the-job injuries are never pretty. Just ask rising St. Louis rapper Smino, who fractured his foot while jumping off stage into a mosh pit at the second show of his debut headlining tour. But Smino pushed through the pain for the rest of the tour, pumping up the crowd at the Roxy Theatre on Thursday with his talent and charming personality.
Energy in the audience was high from the start, and the intimate space buzzed with anticipation for the night. The DJ did a great job maintaining the right vibe between acts, playing hits across a variety of music genres. Fans formed a cypher before the first opener appeared, and it was smiles all around as a man entered the circle and rapped Kendrick Lamar’s “FEAR.” when it came on through the speakers. 
Unfortunately, the various openers weren’t able to pump up crowds during their performances. First was rapper Bari, whose unfamiliar verses failed to hold the spotlight as the crowd continued to trickle in. Jay2, the next performer, almost went unnoticed as he snuck on stage mid-song. He fared slightly better than Bari, doing his best to excite the crowd through call-and-response, but was still faced with blank stares for most of his set. Jean Deaux rounded out the disappointing opening lineup, finding limited success only when supported by catchy, danceable beats.
Soon after, Smino’s band began to set up, signaling to the crowd what was about to take place. The band members and singers started off with an unusually musical sound check, creating a groovy melody over some funky instrumentation until they were satisfied with their equipment. Once everything was in place, the man of the hour hobbled out on his crutches in a white Larry Csonka jersey and started the set with “blkswn,” igniting the crowd in the process.
The fractured foot undoubtedly hindered his performance, as he rarely moved from his position behind the center mic. Keeping the foot propped up on the monitor to ease the pressure, he found other ways to release his high energy, taking pleasure interacting with the crowd wherever possible. He jokingly fired insults at individual crowd members and complained about the subpar food he had found in the city.
Paying homage to the biggest name in hip-hop to come out of “The Lou,” Smino took a break from his own discography midway through the performance to play snippets of “Air Force Ones” and “E.I.” by Nelly. Those who knew were ecstatic to hear the throwbacks, rapping along and dancing while Smino beamed with pride for his hometown of St. Louis. 
The highlight of the night may have been his performance of “Amphetamine,” a dreamy victory lap illuminated by flashlights and lighters. Meant to be the final song, the applause that followed summoned him back to the stage, raising a crutch in triumph before playing a jazzed-up rendition of “Father Son Holy Smoke.”
It was a night to remember for those who attended, and another win for Smino as he continues to gain nationwide recognition as a rising rap star. The Swanita Tour will come to a close soon, wrapping up on May 28 in none other than St. Louis.

“Future Voter I will NOT let you down,” “Everyone is created equal” and “Planet before Profit” read some of the posters from the Women’s March on display at Doheny Library.
Sue Luftschein, librarian and head of special collections and archival and metadata librarian, and Michaela Ullmann, exile studies librarian at the USC special collections library, initiated the process of collecting these posters from protesters in an effort to make an exhibit earlier this year. The exhibit went on display at the end of April and will continue for about another month, according to Luftschein.
“I realized that sometimes we are missing certain collections, having certain gaps in our collections … This was the biggest march in Southern California and in Los Angeles’s history,” Ullmann said. “I thought it would be great to reach out and see if we could collect some of these posters to add [to] our collection.”
Both Ullmann and Luftschein said that the exhibit is an opportunity for students to see the collection without having to request materials. 
Lindsay Anderson, a senior majoring in history, helped develop the exhibit.
“I was a little nervous, but then I thought that this would be a good opportunity to learn something that I have never learned before,” Anderson said. “I didn’t go to the Women’s March and I felt like this was a redeeming opportunity.”
Anderson said that Luftschein and Ullmann helped her create the exhibit and in doing so, gave her ideas for the exhibit arrangement. She said the other librarians gave their views on which posters to display as well.
“There were about 126 to 127 posters and I had to narrow it down to 10,” Anderson said.
Anderson added that the most challenging part was choosing from a wide array of posters on different topics such as immigration, women’s rights and environmental rights. 
“I wanted to choose posters that had messages that were easy to understand and I also wanted it to be diverse in terms of choosing which posters to use,” she said.
Rayna Koishikawa, a recent graduate, who majored in narrative studies said the Women’s March and this exhibit shows the amount of support that people have for each other. 
“It felt like everyone in the street that day was supporting each other,” Koishikawa said. “It’s just remembering that day and reminding people of how much support they have.” 
Ullman said that in future years, these posters will be an artifact to preserve history. In addition, Ullman said that people who submitted the posters included personal stories behind the posters and signs.
“For people who don’t have the opportunity to attend any of these marches, it’s an opportunity to see rather than just looking at it on your phone or your TV,” Luftschein said. “To see the actual objects, the things that people created, and how meaningful they were to the people who created and carried them.”

USC Village will finish construction by the first week of July, program managers said. Following the construction, end-users including the Departments of Public Safety, Transportation, Student Affairs, Auxiliary and Facilities and Management Services will have access to the buildings. Rooms will be ready for occupation in July, according to William Marsh, director of the USC Village. 
The $700 million project, the largest in University history, includes 134,000 square feet of retail space, 466 retail parking spaces and more than 1,500 bike racks. 
More than 34 percent of workers are local hires, USC media representative Ron Mackovich said. 
USC Village will house four residential colleges, including the McCarthy Honors Residential College, the “jewel box of the whole project,” according to Marsh. It will also be home to as many as 35 retailers, including restaurants and services such as Target Express and Trader Joe’s.
Many retailers from the University Village, which was demolished in 2014, will reopen their branches on the new site, including Bank of America, Starbucks and Village Cobbler, Marsh said.
USC Village will also house several business founded by partnerships with at least one USC graduate. These include Trejo’s Tacos, Rance’s Chicago Pizza, Sole Bicycles and URB-E Mobility Hub. 
Some of the new tenant vendors will include SunLife Organics, Greenleaf Gourmet ChopShop, Cava Grill, Rock and Reilly’s and Barilla Restaurant.
“All of the tenants are working very hard to be open when the semester starts,” said Laurie Stone, associate senior vice president of USC Real Estate and Assets. “We expect a majority to hit the mid-August opening date. Some of the tenants will open later in the semester.” 
Despite the additions to USC Village, Aaron Flournoy’s bike shop, Lil Bill’s, will not be returning to campus after 40 years of service to students after the University agreed to a non-compete clause with a new bike shop at USC Village. Flournoy was given until April 30 to vacate.
“I have so much love for this campus and this school,” Flournoy said to the Daily Trojan in March. “Everyone [who has] met me knows how much me and my family love this school and stand behind it. And for USC to tell me to go, or that I’m no longer needed or welcome, I think is an injustice.”
When news of Lil Bill’s Bike Shop closing was first published in March, students started an online petition, which collected 6,500 signatures, to save the shop. 
“Many within and outside of USC looked for ways to assist Mr. Flournoy,” said Earl Paysinger, USC’s vice president of civic engagement. “He was offered a full-time job with benefits as a bicycle mechanic, which was not accepted. Additionally, USC offered Mr. Flournoy an alternative on-campus location near three residence halls, which also was not accepted.”
Aside from the retailers at USC Village, all of the buildings have been approved by the city of Los Angeles, Marsh said, and the team has begun loading furniture into the residential rooms. Currently, four of the six buildings have been loaded with residence furniture, and three buildings have been loaded with laundry equipment. 
The bulk of the work left for May and June is off site, Marsh said.
The team’s next step is to widen the sidewalks on the north and south sides of Jefferson Boulevard, according to Marsh.  June will be the most disruptive month for traffic, he said, because the asphalt on Jefferson Boulevard between Orchard Avenue and Royal Street will have to be redone, and the median will be reconstructed.
Marsh added that the project ran smoothly with no major delays partly due to the lack of rain. The team expected more rain days. 
“We never really had the El Niño that we expected,” Marsh said. “It was one of the big scheduled things that we were really concerned about.”
Rain days cause major delays to construction sites because no construction can take place during a downpour and mitigating 15 acres of rain water takes immense effort, Marsh said. 
While Marsh, a USC alumnus, is hard at work ensuring the final steps of the project will go as planned, he is in awe of the new resources the University will have. 
“No question, this is a game-changer for the University,” Marsh said. “Having great housing, new fresh housing with apartment-style living … and then having the bonus of the retail component related to Target, Trader Joe’s and about 16 different food and beverage facilities will make it highly popular.”
One big question I can not seem to find an answer to is whether or not the old Bank of America building will be demolished (and hopefully repaved or planted) prior to the fall Semester.  I’m sure it will be one of the last things done since it’s being used as construction offices, but nevertheless it’s a terrible eyesore.  It would be nice if it could be gone prior to school starting again.  It also occupies a prominent corner for foot and vehicle traffic, so I’m sure it would be easier and safer for crews to demolish and haul away during the summer, without battling the crowds once the rest of the project is open for business.
This was demolished about 2 weeks ago; It served as the construction office (to avoid bringing in costly trailers). The plot will be repurposed as a landscaped quad until a building is constructed on-site in a future phase of the Village development.
Oh wow.  Sorry, I had no idea it’s gone already. That’s great news.  (I used to keep up to date by watching via the construction web camera, but that was shut down several weeks ago.). Thanks for this update.
If you watch the newest Village Flyover you can see that the building is gone. Exciting!

At USC, a summer internship for a prospective employer is a coveted title, even if it is unpaid or pays minimum wage. Yet, summer jobs provide just as many opportunities and experiences as a summer internship, if not more. A recent survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers revealed that 37 percent of students who had completed an unpaid internship were hired — a rate that is comparable to the 35 percent of students who had not had an internship.
However, at a university like USC — where students claw at any open opportunities to bolster their future career success — it’s a daunting prospect to step out of the internship hunt and consider a different option: a summer job at home. Internship experiences are presented as an exclusive foot in the door for aspiring professionals. Moreover, the internship pool has become highly competitive: In 2014, just over 1,000 coveted positions at Morgan Stanley saw 90,000 applicants hoping to gain an advantage in the competitive workforce. While internship job duties have improved from the archetypal coffee runs to more challenging contributions, holding off from applying for a summer internship and dedicating that time to a summer job can be equally beneficial.
Though summer jobs can come with their fair share of menial tasks, students can glean transferable skills from job experiences. For example, customer service jobs foster crucial interpersonal, managerial and communication skills. And a summer job might pay more than an unpaid internship or an internship that pays minimum wage in a city with a steep living cost. Some internships also offer stipends at the end of the period, which require students to have the financial capabilities to commit to the position before receiving  payment for their work.
While some students might receive paid gigs, many internship placements are located in urban centers with high costs of living. According to analysis by real estate website Zumper, in 2017, the median monthly lease rate for a small, one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles is $2,000. And, though students tend to sublease and share living spaces, inflated housing prices only worsen students’ financial situations. In addition, internships usually do not offer housing for students; students have to find their own housing or commute, if the distance is not too strenuous. With a summer job, students would be making the money they need at an hourly rate and would have time for other crucial tasks, such as polishing up their resume or taking community college courses. Students can also spend time working as a field-specific volunteer, or committing to purposeful side projects, which will contribute to their portfolio or resume.
Students should recognize the benefits of a summer internship, but realize it is not crucial to their career success. Instead, students should be more encouraged to take a local available job. Career coach Emily Porschitz Benson said in USA Today College, “There is no proof with the students I coach that  having an internship provides a greater learning experience than working as a bartender, server, truck driver, babysitter or dance instructor.”
Indeed, some of the world’s most successful individuals worked odd, often unglamorous, jobs. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, for example, worked his first job at a concession stand at Yankee Stadium. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer first worked a summer job as a grocery store clerk, picking up crucial skills from her job. In an interview with Fortune, Mayer said, “I also learned a lot about family economics, how people make trade-offs, and how people make decisions on something fundamental, like how to eat.”
The path to career success is not always through a pipeline of internships with prominent companies. Many students view their summer breaks as a crucial time to make progress for their hopeful careers, but students must recognize that internships do not always equate to success, and vice versa. If students want to use their summer vacations to gain a valuable edge, they must simply be productive with their three months of time — whether it be through a summer job, internship, volunteer experience or even global travel.

Popular dining spot Café 84 will close this fall, reducing the already limited food options of USC students. The inaccessibility of food on campus — the limited hours, the weekend closings, the small range of options — is an issue of growing concern for USC students. Yet the University has only extenuated the issue by removing Café 84. Instead, the University will have — get this —  a fourth Starbucks on or near campus. 
A new dining hall, located within the USC Village, is to serve as Café 84’s replacement. The Office of Residential Education claims that this new dining hall will serve the students of West Residential College better, seeing as it will serve twice as many diners and stay open on weekends. However, it underestimates the inconvenience posed to the majority of students who do not reside in the USC Village. The dining hall is inconveniently far from not only West residents, but also all on-campus residents. 
The decision to eradicate one dining hall and replace it with another that is far more inaccessible does not diversify students’ food options. According to the USC Hospitality website, Café 84 was recently renovated “to accommodate the increasing requests for healthier menu options.” These renovations included a new focus on local, whole foods and an expansion of healthy vegetarian and vegan options.  It seems that the University has removed one of the few dining options to offer healthy selections — only to replace it with a coffee franchise. 
Constructing another Starbucks is redundant, considering it will be the fourth Starbucks on or near campus, with the other three located by New North residence halls, the USC Village, and the intersection of Figueroa and Exposition respectively. The new Starbucks will also compete with the existing Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf located within the School of Cinematic Arts. There appears to be no good reason for the University to replace Café 84, except that this trade-off will generate more revenue.
Starbucks is not a place students can eat at for every meal, and its menu prices could limit food accessibility to students who do not purchase dining dollars or want to budget their food expenses. Furthermore, Starbucks has a limited menu; although it’s a great place to grab a coffee or a quick study snack, its utility ends there. 
It is difficult to believe that the revenue gained from replacing a dining hall with yet a fourth Starbucks is vital to a University with a $4.6 billion endowment.  The replacement suggests that the University has ignored the needs of its students in opting for a profitable chain to replace the nutrition-focused Café 84. While the new dining hall is said to feature an all-plant based station, the University must also factor in food accessibility for its students — dining halls should be strategically placed all around campus to cater to student needs. As USC’s campus expands, food options are a necessary aspect of that expansion. Although the construction of the USC Village holds the promise of a wider range of food options with a new dining hall, the prevalence and accessibility to dining halls on the campus itself should not be overlooked. Students, especially those not on a meal plan, cannot afford to eat out every day, and dining halls play a crucial role in ensuring that students are well-fed with a variety of dining options to select from. 
Starbucks menu prices could limit food accessibility to students who do not purchase dining dollars or want to budget their food expenses. While the USC Village will host a new dining hall in addition to a handful of restaurants, the dining hall is inconveniently located for students not living in the Village, and the high-end restaurants are likely to be out of the price range of some students. Trader Joe’s, for example, is a grocery store known for its high prices, and the restaurants and retail spaces filling the USC Village are unlikely to be in the price range of food-insecure students. The closing of Café 84, and its subsequent replacement with a franchise, highlights a growing campus problem. The issue of food accessibility is not one which should be ignored by the University as it continues to expand our campus.
