Jim Harbaugh left Stanford earlier this month to take over as the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. Now, some of his recruits are changing their minds about playing for the Cardinal, and USC stands to serve as one of the main beneficiaries. One day after running back Amir Carlisle (Sunnyvale, Calif.) switched from Stanford to USC, four-star linebacker Anthony Sarao (Absecon, N.J.) made the same decision.
Sarao visited Los Angeles this past weekend. When making his decision, he told USCFootball.com, “It was a perfect visit. I had a great time out there.” The campus wasn’t the only selling points. The New Jersey native admired the coaching staff as well.
“USC has one of the best coaching staffs in college football,” Sarao told USCFootball.com. “They definitely know what they’re talking about.”
Sarao, who is ranked 11th at his position by Scout.com, possesses great strength and ball carriers have had a tough time escaping once he has them wrapped up. The 6’1”, 220-pound linebacker can also go toe-to-toe with fullbacks when he blitzes or tries to shoot through the gaps. He brings with him good instincts and defends passes well when lining up against tight ends. Sarao addresses an area of severe need for the Trojans.
With starters Malcolm Smith and Michael Morgan graduating, Lane Kiffin remains unsure about how the linebacking corps line up if USC played today.
Sarao’s commitment is a huge boost for the Trojans nationally. Despite NCAA sanctions, the Trojans were able to nab a quality player from across the country, which gives more credibility to the program. California has always been a stronghold for USC recruiters, but the ability to add top talent from across the country makes the roster even stronger.
To date, USC has built the fourth best recruiting class in the country according to Rivals.com.

The stage was set for Pete Carroll to make history, as his Seattle Seahawks marched into Soldier Field Sunday to take on the Chicago Bears in the NFC Divisional Playoffs.
The Seahawks had met with the Bears in week six of the regular season, winning that matchup 23-20, but things were different this time around, as the Bears got off to a quick 21-0 start in the first half before cruising to a 35-21 victory.
But before falling in defeat, Seattle made one final valiant effort.
Going into the fourth quarter, the Seahawks, who were looking at a 25-point deficit, saw quarterback Matt Hasselbeck connect with wide receiver Mike Williams for one of his two touchdowns around the 11-minute mark.
The play appeared to ignite the Seahawks’ offense and revive the 35-year-old Hasselbeck, as he went on to throw two more touchdown passes before the team’s comeback attempt was stopped.
Trailing by 11 with less than two minutes remaining on the clock, the Seahawks attempted an onside kick, but were unable to recover it ending the game, in which the Bears punched their ticket to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2007.
The Bears were quite effective against Seattle’s running game, one week after Marshawn Lynch amassed 131 yards on the ground, including an explosive 67-yard touchdown run in the team’s 41-36 win over the New Orleans Saints.
The most impressive Seahawk of the afternoon, behind Hasslebeck’s 258 yards, may have been wide receiver Brandon Stokely who finished with eight catches for 85 yards and a touchdown.
However, Stokely’s performed looked mild in comparison to Bears’ tight end Greg Golson, who totaled 113 yards, three receptions and a touchdown. Quarterback Jay Cutler threw for 274 yards and two touchdown passes, while running for another.
The Bears will host the Green Bay Packers next week at 12 p.m. PST on FOX with the winner earning a trip to Super Bowl XLV.

Well, Ricky Gervais might not be working in Hollywood again any time soon.
Within the first five minutes of his hosting gig at the 68th annual Golden Globe Awards, the British comedian managed to not so-subtly imply that Tom Cruise is gay, accuse the Hollywood Foreign Press Association of taking bribes, call out Charlie Sheen for his hooker-related exploits and completely eviscerate The Tourist.

But besides the palpably awkward atmosphere created by Gervais’s obvious (and humorous) disdain for Hollywood, the Globes broadcast was fairly lackluster, with a few unexpected wins in the TV categories but no surprises amongst the film wins.
Glee and Boardwalk Empire were the big TV winners of the night. Glee took home Best Series Comedy or Musical, and Chris Colfer and Jane Lynch won Best Supporting Actor and Actress. Colfer, who plays Kurt, a gay high school student dealing with bullying and homophobia, seemed genuinely shocked at the win and gave a heartfelt speech, speaking to the kids who are “told they can’t be who they are,” and advising them, “Screw that, kids.”
HBO newcomer Boardwalk Empire won Best Series Drama, beating out the seemingly infallible Mad Men.  Empire’s Steve Buscemi took Best Actor in a Drama Series, a surprise because of his illustrious competition: Jon Hamm, Michael C. Hall, Hugh Laurie, and Bryan Cranston – all critical darlings. Katey Sagal garnered some attention for the little-noticed FX series Sons of Anarchy with her win for Best Actress in a TV Drama.
Laura Linney took home Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance as a woman diagnosed with cancer in Showtime’s new series The Big C. The Big Bang Theory’s Jim Parsons’ win for Best Actor in a Comedy Series was one of the bigger surprises of the night, considering the show has never gained much award season attention.
Al Pacino’s win for TV movie You Don’t Know Jack and Clare Danes’ for Temple Grandin were no surprise after their success at the Emmy awards last summer, but few people have even heard of Carlos, the Globe winner for Best Miniseries or TV Movie. The French-produced miniseries about a notorious Venezuelan terrorist, which aired on the Sundance channel, managed to beat out three nominees from HBO including the critically lauded The Pacific.
On the film side, everything played out as expected. While there were no obvious frontrunners in the Supporting Actor and Actress races, Christian Bale and Melissa Leo’s wins for The Fighter came as no surprise.
Annette Bening took home Best Actress in a Comedy as most critics predicted, and she is a frontrunner for the Oscar as well. But she is expected to lose that award to Black Swan’s Natalie Portman, who won tonight in the Drama category. Paul Giammatti won Best Actor in a Comedy for the little-seen Barney’s Version, and, every critics’ pick for Best Actor, Colin Firth won for The King’s Speech.
Diane Warren won Best Song for “You Haven’t Seen the Last of Me” in Burlesque, while Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor took home Best Original Score for The Social Network.  Pixar continued its long tradition of award season success with Toy Story 3’s win for Best Animated Feature, and the Danish film In a Better World took best Foreign Film.
The Kids Are All Right thankfully beat its far inferior competitors in the Best Comedy or Musical category. And as expected, The Social Network swept the major categories of Best Screenplay, Director, and Picture Drama.
So the Hollywood Foreign Press Association may not have embarrassed itself with any bad wins this time, but it might need to reconsider its choice of host next year if it wants to keep celebrities happy.

She’s pregnant on the Golden Globes carpet! She’s glowing during her acceptance speech! And, oddly, she seems to be in every major movie and trailer playing across America.
Sure, you’ve seen her play a demented ballerina in the critic’s darling Black Swan, and you’ve probably not willfully seen her in the dreadfully formulaic and weakly premised No Strings Attached, but she’s also on every magazine cover and the upcoming The Other Woman, Your Highness, Thor.
Natalie Portman | Creative Commons
Never heard of these movies? Here’s a rundown and a little preview on the bizarre, eclectic and diverse repertoire up Portman’s cinematic sleeve. Blame her agent, manager or her, but frankly, we’re a little puzzled by the mixed bag of roles. We all know Portman’s got acting chops, but that doesn’t mean she’s got to take cushy roles for the team.
The Other Woman:
In this role, Portman plays a mistress-turned-miserable woman who has an affair with a married man, gets him to leave his wife for her and has a child with him. Tragedy strikes with the death of that daughter and Portman’s character is left to grieve with her stepson. We’ll see how more conservative moviegoers react to this interesting film, which takes its story from a novel by Ayelet Waldman.
Your Highness:
Directed by the same mastermind that brought us Pineapple Express, David Gordon Green, this period-piece fantasy is Robin Hood: Men in Tights with some major computer generated effects. We’re not sure what Portman’s doing in this cheesy comedy as the bow-and-arrow wielding Isabel next to a painfully dumb James Franco (Prince Fabious) and the predictably hapless Danny McBride, but one can only assume that she had fun gallivanting about in a tunic.
Thor:
Let’s face it: Portman will probably do better than Katie Holmes’ clammy performance in Batman Begins, but frankly, Portman may be wasting her abilities in this Viking-comic-tale that tells the story of one of Marvel’s lesser known heroes, the banished god Thor. Who knows – the movie may be fun, but no matter how many millions of dollars it will score at the box office, we’ll still be scratching our heads at why Portman and Anthony Hopkins, both critically acclaimed actors, have chosen to do a comic book movie.

Moviegoers last left Jason Bourne swimming away in the East River after being shot at by nemesis Noah Vosen, head of Operation Blackbriar. Whether the reason is to look at the heartthrob Matt Damon for two straight hours or delve into a new possible tangent of the story, such as Bourne and Nicky Parson’s past relationship, much of the public is still unsatisfied with the end of the Bourne trilogy.
Never missing out on an opportunity to please the average movie goer and the pocketbook, Hollywood has responded by being in talks for the next movie in the franchise over the past year.
Three obstacles have unfortunately made it impossible for a complete reunion of all the past talents. First, The Bourne Legacy, the book the next movie would be based on is not written by the original author Robert Ludlum who died in 2001, but by thriller and fantasy writer Eric Van Lustbader. But no big deal, there are several great movies that don’t stay true to the book.

Here comes obstacle number two. The director of the previous Bourne movies, Paul Greengrass, has been replaced by Michael Clayton director. And the cherry on top seems to be The Bourne Legacy is so far sans Damon.
Even though the movie is to be released in theaters August 3, 2012, it has yet to be put into production.
Although over the past months tension has been pretty taut between team Sony and Gilroy versus team Damon and Greengrass, the Critics Choice Awards this past Friday night gave light to a new and hopeful possibility.
According to The Hollywood Reporter Damon said, “I really hope it’s going to happen.” But there are apparently a few conditions.
“It’s really up to Paul Greengrass, the director. I’ve always said I won’t do it without him and I think it would be a bad idea to do it without Paul.”
But the question remains whether Greengrass can be coaxed into directing another Bourne movie.
“I think Paul’s probably going to do one or two other films that he’s got kind of cooking but after that [maybe they would start working on a Bourne film],” he revealed. “I think it’s kind of the thing where enough time has passed that I think it won’t matter if we wait five more years to do it.”
Patience will apparently be the virtue Bourne fans will have to develop.

With award season in full swing, David Fincher is already thinking of next season.
The director of past Oscar winning movies, such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and the new critically acclaimed The Social Network, is set to direct and bring to the screen an adaption of the late Stieg Larsson’s much buzzed about bestselling novel The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.
Fincher recently revealed to the New York Times that he will be partnering once again with Trent Reznor, the frontman of the band Nine Inch Nails, who co-composed the score of The Social Network. Reznor will again combine his talents with composer Atticus Ross (The Book of Eli). The dark and subtle style they used for The Social Network’s soundtrack is sure to fit perfectly with Larsson’s mysterious crime novel.
Although the novel has already been successfully adapted to the screen in Sweden, Sony looks to create a film that will draw in a significantly wider audience with stars such as Daniel Craig playing Mikael Blomkvist, Rooney Mara playing Lisbeth Salander, along with appearances from Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright, Christopher Plummer.
Set to be released at the end of this year on Dec. 21, Sony is certain to have another successful trilogy in its hands.

The iconic Queen of Pop is quite the chameleon.
From naughty school girl, to the risqué I’m a Slave for You stage, to her failed comeback and now her actual return to the top, Spears is constantly evolving. Her new hit single, Hold it Against Me, was leaked last Monday, Jan. 10, and was officially released Tuesday, Jan. 11. This hot new number was released by JIVE Records, a facet of Sony Music Entertainment, and was produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin. It features elements of dub step and trance music and is sure to frequent clubs all across Los Angeles.
It astonishingly shot straight to number one, setting a new record for first day radio play. Womanizer and 3 had similar popular results, as is to be expected from the talented and brilliant Spears. It seems you can always count on Spears to produce a pop sensation, or at the least some form of entertaining scandal.
As for the rest of the album, Spears posted on her Twitter in December, “I’m almost done with my new album and it will be coming out this March. I AM IN L-O-V-E WITH IT”. We would expect nothing less from the artistic, innovative and most infamous pop star of our generation.
Worst Britney Spears song I’ve ever heard. It’s so generic, and it sounds like she sang about 10 seconds of it and the rest is looped and autotuned. It’s not even good for dancing.
