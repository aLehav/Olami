A dominant second half propelled the USC women’s basketball team to a 62-50 victory over BYU on Wednesday and into the quarterfinals of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament.
Leading the way · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath, pictured here against UCLA, scored 14 points and grabbed eight rebounds, leading USC to a 62-50 victory over the Cougars in Provo, Utah. The Women of Troy now advance to the Elite Eight of the WNIT for the first time in the program’s history. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
Trailing at the break, the Women of Troy (22-12) opened the second half on fire, scoring on five of their first six possessions to turn a six-point deficit into a 36-31 lead.
“At halftime we talked about how this could be our last game,” said senior center Kari LaPlante.  “In the second half we sucked it up and pushed through [our fatigue]. We were able to catch our wind and that’s what made the difference.”
Junior guard Ashley Corral was instrumental during the run, scoring seven of USC’s first 11 points opening the second half.
For the third straight game, Corral gave USC a much-needed scoring punch off the bench, finishing with 10 points and a pair of three-pointers.
The Women of Troy outscored BYU 37-19 in the second half and held the Cougars to 23 percent shooting.
USC shot 48 percent after the break, attacking the basket and getting easy scoring opportunities.
“We didn’t follow the game plan in the first half,” LaPlante said. “In the second half we actually did what we were supposed to do.”
That sharp shooting was not present for the Women of Troy early in a first half marked by a flurry of missed shots and turnovers.
USC went through a pair of long scoring droughts in the first half, going without a basket for nearly five minutes during one stretch and getting outscored 10-0 to close the half.
USC held a 25-21 lead with three minutes left in the first half before turnovers brought its momentum to a sudden halt.
The Women of Troy only attempted one more shot before halftime, turning the ball over on four of their final five possessions.
BYU seemed to capitalize on every mistake USC made during this time, scoring the final 10 points of the half to take a 31-25 lead into the break.
At the break, BYU forward Mindy Bonham led all scorers with 15 points, although USC held  the senior guard to just six points in the second half.
“We really are a second-half team,” said freshman forward Cassie Harberts. “In the first half we were a step slow everywhere and we weren’t doing our coverages on defense.”
Junior guard Briana Gilbreath led USC in the first half with eight points and five rebounds.
Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci missed all five of her field goal attempts, but collected seven rebounds for the Women of Troy.
Winning the rebounding battle has been a barometer for USC’s success all season, and the team was able to capitalize yet again on Wednesday.
The Women of Troy grabbed 43 rebounds and held BYU — even with its 6-foot-7 center in Jennifer Hamson — to just 34.
BYU’s Kristen Riley finished with a double-double, scoring 11 points and grabbing 10 rebounds, while Riley Hall also scored 10 points in the losing effort.
For USC, Marinacci led the team with 10 rebounds, and also chipped in eight points of her own.
Gilbreath led the Women of Troy with 14 points, eight rebounds and four assists.
Senior guard Jacki Gemelos chipped in 13 points and seven rebounds, while Harberts contributed 11 points and five rebounds.
“It’s nice that we can continue our season,” Harberts said. “With every game and practice, we’re getting better.”
USC is now set to face either Wyoming or Colorado in the WNIT Quarterfinals on Sunday.

It’s that time of year again, when just about everybody is glued to a television.
In the words of Dick Vitale: “It’s March Madness, baby.”
With the NCAA expanding the field of teams from 65 to 68, there was sure to be controversy over which teams were picked to dance.
For the USC men’s basketball team, a tough non-conference schedule included wins over then-No. 9 Texas at home, then-No. 19 Tennessee on the road, and quality wins during the Pac-10 season over UCLA and then-No. 16 Arizona at home, and Washington on the road.
If there is ever such a thing as a good loss, the Trojans even took then-No. 3 Kansas to the wire, losing in the closing seconds at Allen Fieldhouse 70-68.
But, like most people figured, USC was not assured of an at-large bid.
Selection Sunday, however, certainly created a lot of buzz when it came around.
USC was chosen as one of the teams lucky enough to receive another shot at making the field of 64. Its opponent: the Virginia Commonwealth Rams.
ESPN’s Jay Bilas chastised the NCAA selection committee for choosing VCU for a play-in game, but the Rams defeated the Trojans and have now danced their way to the Sweet 16, upsetting No. 6 seed Georgetown and No. 3 seed Purdue.
Although the Trojans lost the play-in game, at least they had one last chance to prove they were worthy of playing among the best teams in the nation.
On the flip side, the USC women’s basketball team ended the regular season with a similar résumé.
The Women of Troy’s tough non-conference schedule included wins over then-No. 22 Gonzaga, then-No. 17 Georgia Tech and Fresno State. All three teams received bids to the tournament.
USC went to the wire with then-No. 4 Xavier on the road, losing by three points, (Xavier also made the NCAA tournament) and played Princeton, then-No. 9 UCLA, then-No. 1 Stanford and Arizona State tough at home. All four schools made the Big Dance, as well.
Yet, it wasn’t enough, as the Women of Troy were denied an at-large bid for the second consecutive year under USC coach Michael Cooper.
But it got me thinking: What if the NCAA expanded the field of teams for the women’s game as well?
What if the USC women’s basketball team had one more opportunity to prove themselves?
After all, it’s only fair the women get the same chance as their male counterparts.
I’m thinking if the Women of Troy received a similar invitation to compete in the play-in game, they could have certainly made some noise in the tournament.
Their non-conference schedule showed they can hang with just about any team in the nation if they play to their abilities.
Their strength of schedule ranked 25th in the nation, according to CollegeRPI.com.
And you can certainly make the argument they were deserving of a bid compared to other teams who received tickets to the Big Dance (Arizona State, Vanderbilt, Dayton).
After covering the women’s basketball team last year and for part of this year, I know the team is more than capable of competing with the best teams.
Even though they did not receive an at-large bid, the Women of Troy accepted an invitation to the Women’s National Invitational Tournament.
Now, they are certainly showing why they deserved a ticket to the Big Dance this season.
A narrow win over UC Santa Barbara at the Galen Center, a convincing victory over Nevada in Reno and a 62-50 win over BYU in Provo has catapulted the team into the Elite Eight of the WNIT for the first time in the program’s history.
Although the WNIT might not be recognized as much as the NCAA tournament, USC is still playing for a championship.
But more than playing for a championship, they are playing each game with something to prove.
“Coming that close to making the NCAA tournament is a bummer,” said sophomore forward Christina Marinacci. “But my mindset is … [to try] and win the whole thing, and show the committee that we deserved to play in the NCAAs.”
With the Women of Troy three wins away from a WNIT title, imagine if they had gotten just one more shot to prove themselves.
Their play in the regular season proved it, their play in the WNIT has proved it thus far and expanding the women’s field from 64 teams to 68 teams would have given them another shot to prove they belong with the best teams in the nation.
It’s March Madness, when ordinary players become heroes and when teams become Cinderella stories.
Give the Women of Troy one more chance and their dreams might come true.

The reason this club is getting passed over on selection day is this: Its not how they win or lose so much, its when they lose or win. When Chris Gobrecht was there, she always put together a monster preseason schedule, she recruited better than Mark Trakh and Cooper. Gobrecht resurrected the women of troy down trodden program, only to be terminated for not advancing to the NCAA’s…lol! The team was obviously on the verge of turning the corner, but yet NOW FIRED athletic Mike Garrett did not give her the opportunity. Mark Trakh was allowed to come in with Gobrecht’s recruits go to the NCAA’s back to back 2yrs consecutively, When it was time for him to put up or shut up with his recruits, he could not produce, He was fired. Now Michael Cooper is on the forefront, and he can not produce either.
This program is declining, and eventually, it will be back to the down trodden program it was. The committee took all of this in consideration, and this is why this team has NOT danced in years. I DOUBT THEY MAKE IT NEXT YEAR EITHER, its like a curse.
great article,,, very good team.  they are really jelling, with come back wins in both games in wnit.  Let us back the Babes in Troyland [affectionate play-on-phrase from movie Babes in Toyland..cica 1960’s]   These Women can flat out play ball, and at a high level.  They deserve our support.  Where is the next viewing party.  Is the Final Four wnit on tv??   Fight On!

Last year, the USC men’s swim team took home 11th place at the NCAA men’s swimming and diving championships, while the women’s team placed seventh in their NCAA competition.
Steep challenge · The Trojans have their eyes set on winning an NCAA title but must first get past California and 2008 Olympian Nathan Adrian.  -  Daily Trojan file photo 
A year later, the women’s team showed the country it was a force to be reckoned with, taking home third place at the 2011 NCAA women’s swimming and diving national championships held last weekend at Texas’ Jamail Swim Center in Austin.
With that victory still fresh in its memory, the men’s team looks to achieve similar success hoping to improve from its 11th-place performance last time it participated in NCAAs.
“Our women’s team accomplished its goal and we have the same program, the same training schedule and we have kind of the same taper,” said freshman Vladimir Morozov. “We are looking forward to performing as well as the women did, or even better.”
The 2011 NCAA men’s swimming and diving championships will be held at the University of Minnesota Aquatic Center in Minneapolis.
Teams such as No. 1 California, No. 2 Stanford, No. 6 Arizona and No. 7 USC are participating.
No. 4 Texas enters the competition as the defending NCAA champion.
Arizona, according to Morozov, is the team’s biggest rival, with both teams eager to beat the other.
With the women’s NCAA competition complete, the Trojans look to build upon the success of their female counterparts.
Although the men and women swimmers compete at different times, USC coach Dave Salo stressed that the team thinks of itself as one entity, not two.
“We acknowledge that we are one team, and that the results of one are the results of the other,” Salo said. “I think [the men’s] confidence is always buoyed by how the swimmers before them did. They looked at the women’s team and saw that they did a good job, so now it’s their turn.”
Although dual meets made up most of the team’s competition this season, the goal for USC’s team has always been to succeed at NCAAs.
With swimmers like Morozov, who has broken several personal and school records this season, and All-Americans sophomore Clement Lefert and junior Patrick White, the team, as a result, hopes to find itself on the podium at NCAAs.
“I always set high goals for myself,” Morozov said. “I’d like to win the 50- or 100-freestyle and my biggest competition is Nathan Adrian, the Olympian from Cal. There are some other guys who are close to my best time, but I’m a freshman so I’m just excited to be there.”
Though Adrian, who holds American records in 50- and 100-yard freestyle and earned a gold medal as a member of the U.S. 4×100 relay team during the 2008 Olympics, possess a threat to USC’s title hopes, the Trojans do not appear fazed by the stiff competition presented by the Golden Bears, among others.
As with the women, Salo’s bunch anticipates a top-10 finish.
“For men’s, our goal is to make top-10,” Salo said. “If we have a perfect meet and make no mistakes, we could make top five. They’re excited to go. They’ve looked at the women’s meet results and said, yeah, let’s go.”

The university recognized Dana and David Dornsife for their $200 million donation to the College of Letters, Arts, & Sciences in a re-naming ceremony at Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday.
Honored · Howard Gillman (left), the dean of the College, Dana and David Dornsife, and President C. L. Max Nikias stand together in Bovard. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
With more than 1,000 people in attendance, President C. L. Max Nikias, members of the Board of Trustees, senior administration, faculty and staff of the College of Letters, Arts, & Sciences, students and alumni honored Dana and David Dornsife for their donation, which is the singe largest donation in the university’s history.
“This moment in USC’s history is a connecting point when the College stands strong and is a mighty point of change,” said Edward Roski, Jr., chairman of the Board of Trustees.
Howard Gillman, dean of the newly named Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, & Sciences, expressed his gratitude for the Dornsife’s donation.
“With more than 10,000 students, 700 faculty and 600 staff members, [the College] is really the beating heart of the university,” Gillman said.
Scott Soames, USC professor of philosophy, said he came from Princeton to teach at USC because he liked the university’s vision. He said the Dornsife donation encourages faculty and students to continue in the right direction to make this vision become reality.
Because of the nature and generosity of their gift, Nikias presented the Dornsifes with the University Medallion. In USC’s 164-year history, the only other University Medallion, awarded to those who have made incredible contributions to the university, was given to Walter Annenberg, who donated $120 million in 1993.

Through their donation, the Dornsifes have demonstrated their confidence in the USC administration, faculty and students.
“We’ve seen a continuity in the leaders of the university making the College a major part of USC,” David Dornsife said.
Their donation is the single-largest donation to a college of letters, arts and sciences at any American university.
“This unrestricted donation advances the cause of the College,” said Paul Barton, USC alumnus from the College’s class of 1984. “It’s always great to get another reason to love USC.”
I agree with Andre’s points.
Now, me talk about some other things!
22% of USC’s incoming freshmen are legacy admits.
what a joke this school is.  a degree mill of sorts.  on par with the university of phoenix.
it’s interesting that US News & World Report ranks USC #22, but among colleges and universities all over the world, USC comes in at…”between 70 – 80″  UCLA you ask?  #12
Have a nice day.
Andre,
Expect people to respect you when you write WTF on your response to this and then speak to the President of the University and call him “hey Max”? 
Very disrespectful and not a way to get people to care about your “point” or the way you responded to this and to the other blogger Paul. 
Where is your heart, soul, manners and respect for others?
Rockefeller College is a Residential College (dorm), like Trojan Hall or Birnkrant; it is common to name dorms after benefactors.
The others are Professional schools–again, totally common to name Professional schools after benefactors like Viterbi, Roski, etc.
John Harvard is Harvard.
USC College, whatever it is called, is the “College” of USC and why we would sell this is not understood by me.
The Dornsifes are exemplarary Alumni–their donation is transforming–would they not have done it without changing the name of the College within the University–only they know.
You have missed my point completely and are comparing apples and organes. You make such a ham-handed comparative arguement, I wonder if you understand contexts.
There is no anger, just disappointment, and this is certainly not a mud slinging match.
Dear Andre,
Rockefeller College at Princeton University was named in his honor in 1982 due to donation from, you guessed it, John D. Rockefeller III. Harvard was named after John Harvard who donated half of his estate and his entire library to the school. 
Ever hear of Wharton or Anderson School of Business? 
This gift is going to do a lot of good for a lot of current and future students throughout the history of USC. I would think you would be proud of that fact, and proud that a fellow Trojan donated the money. 
Where is all that anger coming from? 
Very un-Trojan like.
USC College no more–I guess my diploma just became obselete. Dornsife College? WTF?
Would Harvard, Princeton, etc sell their college’s name,  the heart and soul of the university?
Hey Max, how much for Tommy Trojan?
What isn’t for sale?

Gov. Jerry Brown’s plan to tackle California’s mounting budget crisis includes a $500 million reduction in University of California, California State University and community college funding.
UC President Mark Yudof announced on March 16 $50 million in cuts to UC’s headquarters in Oakland and its other centralized offices. The goal of the cuts is to alleviate the financial burdens on individual UC campuses.
Cuts to the UC budget could prove beneficial to USC, as the university attempts to attract California’s and the nation’s brightest students.
Kirk Brennan, USC’s director of Undergraduate Admissions, said the financial adversities affecting the UC system could result in more students and families considering private institutions such as USC.
“There is a general perception on the part of families that the UC [system] may be a little less stable of an option,” Kirk said. “That perception will cause more people to think about private schools, and USC will see more interest because of that.”
Officials at UC schools fear tuition could also increase by more than the already proposed eight percent hike for the Fall 2011 semester if California voters fail to extend a tax increase.
Early this summer, voters will head to the polls for a special election to vote on extending the tax increases implemented in 2009 under then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for five additional years, which raises both income and property taxes.
The tax increases have cost the average citizen $260 per year, according to the State Department of Finance.
Arjun Chaurushia, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he considered the financial situation at the UC schools when making his college decision.
“I took financial stability into account when I applied to colleges,” Chaurushia said. “I anticipated more tuition hikes at the UC [schools] and that made USC a better value.”
The financial stability of USC is also appealing to potential faculty, according to Martin Levine, vice provost of faculty affairs.
“When we make hires we look all over the country and world, and our financial stability is one of the many qualities that captures eminent people from the UC system and other universities across the nation,” Levine said.
Levine, however, believes that regardless of the UC system’s financial woes, potential faculty members are still attracted to USC because of its strong academic curriculum.
“USC is well known to be moving vigorously ahead academically, and that is part of our attraction,” Levine said. “We don’t need to tell people about the situation at their home universities, though, we are able to tell them about the excellent prospects at USC.”
Other officials, including Berkley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau, suggest individual UC campuses be given some liberty in determining tuition costs. Currently tuition is the same for all 10 UC campuses, and each campus has been asked to cut roughly $30 to $50 million from their budgets.
Most UC campuses will also have to lay off faculty and staff and reduce the scope of their curricula because of the budget crisis.
In a video message, Yudof warned Californians of the grave impact cuts in the UC system will have on higher education in the state.
“Make no mistake about it, no matter how efficient we are, a funding gap that is this large is going to significantly impact and change the University of California,” Yudof said. “We cannot save or streamline our way around a problem of this magnitude.”
Limited  University of California Berkeley financial resources: UC Berkeley Chancellor continues spending.
(The author who has 35 years’ consulting experience, has taught at University of California Berkeley, where he was able to observe the culture and the way senior management work.)
Recently: Chancellor Birgeneau pays ex Michigan governor $300,000 for lectures; NCAA places Chancellor Birgeneau’s Cal. men’s basketball program on probation
Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau’s ($500,000 salary) eight-year fiscal track record is dismal indeed.  He would like to blame the politicians, since they stopped giving him every dollar he has asked for, and the state legislators do share some responsibility for the financial crisis.  But not in the sense he means.
A competent chancellor would have been on top of identifying inefficiencies and then crafting a plan to fix them.  Competent oversight by the UC Board of Regents and the legislature would have required him to provide data on inefficiencies and on what steps he was taking to solve them.  Instead, every year Birgeneau would request a budget increase, the regents would agree to it, and the legislature would provide.  The hard questions were avoided by all concerned, and the problems just piled up to $150 million of inefficiencies….until there was no money left.
It’s not that Birgeneau was unaware that there were, in fact, waste and inefficiencies. Faculty and staff raised issues with Birgeneau and Provost Breslauer, but when they failed to see relevant action taken, they stopped.  Finally, Birgeneau engaged some expensive ($3,000,000) consultants to tell him what he should have known as a leader or been able to find out from the bright, engaged Cal. people. (A prominent East Coast university was accomplishing the same thing without expensive consultants)
In short, there is plenty of blame to go around.  Merely cutting out inefficiencies will not have the effect desired. But you never want a serious crisis to go to waste. Increasing the budget is not enough; transforming senior management is necessary

Although the majority of college students have frequent contact with their parents, students are more likely to receive encouragement from their parents to be independent and solve problems on their  own — USC students are no exception, according to a recent study.
Daily Trojan
The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth and Emmanuel College.
Though 88.4 percent of the parents surveyed said they were involved in their children’s lives in 2011, far less than were “very involved.”
Most USC students said they communicate with their parents about once per month and share general information, such as upcoming tests, grades, stress, housing and life back home.
“I’ll tell my mom how I’m doing and what tests are coming up,” said Sherryl Bako, an undeclared freshman. “If I’m having a hard time, I’ll tell her, but I won’t go into detail.”
Other students keep their parents more involved in their lives.
“I am in constant contact with them and I share lots of details about my studies, social life and soccer life,” said Alexandra Harrison, a freshman majoring in English (creative writing). “However, they do not monitor me or check up on my work like in high school.”
Although many students tend to keep their problems to themselves, some, like Jabree Webber, a freshman majoring in theatre, share them with their parents and often solve them with their advice.
“They do give me advice, but I feel that it’s not overbearing, because they’re so far away and using their advice is up to my discretion,” Webber said.
In the study, 76.5 percent of parents reported having at least weekly contact via cellphones. Weekly text messages have increased from 31.7 percent to 53.5 percent while weekly emails have decreased from 60.8 percent to 51.9 percent.
The majority of USC students said they talk over the phone, send text messages and occasionally Skype with their parents, as opposed to sending emails, which are used for less personal issues, such as housing, bills and flight information.
“They’re really involved from a financial standpoint, frequently reminding me of when I’m spending too much or when I need to meet deadlines for turning in paperwork and things like that,” said Bruce Cabanayan, a senior majoring in biochemistry.
Aside from some financial issues, most parents don’t involve themselves much with their children’s college lives.
The report claimed parents were more likely to encourage their kids to handle problems on their own.
“My mom knows that I’ve grown up a lot, so she lets me make my own decisions, but she still gives me good advice and is encouraging,” said Stephanie Oguine, a freshman majoring in accounting.
Most USC students are content with their parental situations.
“If they were less involved I think I would have a much harder time because I wouldn’t have the same emotional support that I do currently,” said Damian Pherigo, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. “If they were much more involved it might be a little bit annoying but I do wish they could visit me in L.A. more frequently.”

Beginning today, Trojan Grounds, USC’s only 24-hour food option, will be closed from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., an announcement that has drawn the ire of many students.
Changes · Quinn Mason, a freshman majoring in cinema telivision critical studies, walks out of Trojan Grounds, USC’s 24-hour coffee shop and convenience store. USC Hospitality announced a reduction in hours Wednesday. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan 
USC Hospitality began considering the change in the middle of last semester, according to Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality.
Klinger also said Trojan Grounds, commonly known around campus as TroGro, has not always been a 24-hour establishment, but has switched back and forth in the last 10 years.
He said he does not think the change in hours will have a major impact on students.
“Based on the minimal, and some days non-consequential, traffic between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., we do not anticipate the change in hours having a significant affect on the students,” Klinger wrote in an email.
Nevertheless, many students are disappointed.
“It’s terrible that TroGro won’t be open 24 hours a day,” said Megan Tucker, a sophomore majoring in political science. “I won’t have any place to go to keep me going when I’m studying in Leavey at 2:30 in the morning.”
Ryan Williams, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, created an event on Facebook to protest the changes at TroGro.
He is encouraging people to email Phillip Valdez, associate director of USC Hospitality, asking Hospitality to reconsider the decrease in hours.
“I thought that doing a petition online would be easier, since it would just go straight to [USC Hospitality]. We just want to flood their inboxes with emails to tell them that we’re not happy with their decision,” Williams said.
The Facebook event, titled “Keep TroGro Open 24/7!,” has reached more than 2,500 members in just one day, as of press time.
“First I just invited my friends to the event. We all live in Birnkrant, so we use TroGro the most,” Williams said.
“But clearly the student reaction has been overwhelming. Plenty of people are pulling all-nighters and need food to keep going,”
Arunima Paul, a graduate student studying English, visual studies, said even though she isn’t on campus as much as the typical USC student, she still wishes TroGro would remain open 24 hours a day.
“When I am on campus, I come here a lot and rely on my cup of coffee from TroGro,” Paul said.
Employees at TroGro also expressed unhappiness about the recent hour changes.
“It’s cutting back on the hours that I can work here, but there’s really nothing you can do about it. It’s pretty inconvenient for all of us,” said Edgar Santellana, a TroGro employee.
Klinger, however, said USC Hospitality is open to feedback from students, who can send their comments to http://hospitality.usc.edu/Feedback.aspx.
“We are a fluid organization and we are open to suggestions, ideas and solutions,” Klinger wrote. “Changes can and will be made after consideration, weighing the options and extensive input from all students, staff, faculty and constituents.”
USC receives a $200 million donation, but can’t even be bothered to keep one measly food store open 24/7. Thanks a lot, administration
Too bad Klinger wasn’t into transparency before making the change and now is spewing the same old admin-speak for, ‘sorry we really are interested in what students say’. But will no doubt cut the hours after ‘careful consideration’.
Kris klinger = fail as director of USC hospitality, fail in business(101), fail etc…….
Duh NOT winning!

The Supreme Court earlier this month upheld the rights of bigots to protest in front of U.S. soldiers’ funerals.
At first glance, this sounds like in reality an absolutely horrible decision, but it merely reinforces the vital American principle of free speech.
Daily Trojan
It also reminds us that if we want to uphold the positive aspects of the First Amendment, we cannot stifle the negative.
An appellate court had ruled in favor of the father of a fallen Marine who sued Kansas pastor Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church for leading a protest that “intentionally inflicted emotional distress” at his son’s funeral, but the Supreme Court ruled overwhelmingly in favor of Phelps in an 8-to-1 decision.
With this ruling, deluded parishioners of the church can continue to hold up signs reading “thank God for dead soldiers” and “God hates fags” near military funerals.
In other words, they can spew hateful rhetoric against a grieving nation and abuse their First Amendment rights by pushing disgusting messages onto society.
Rulings like this, however, are nothing new. A case in the ‘70s ended in victory for neo-Nazis who used their First Amendment rights to march through the streets of Chicago.
If we want to protect our right to speak for positive change we cannot stifle the misguided voices of those who use their constitutional right for negative change.
Silencing political hate groups and their divisively un-American rhetoric would be un-American in and of itself.
With this in mind, USC’s Policy on Free Expression and Dissent contains certain provisions that are disconcerting.
Because USC is a private, not public, institution, it is not necessarily required to adhere to the same First Amendment policy as is promoted by the Supreme Court.
USC’s policy holds that free speech in the form of “coercive disruption” is not acceptable.
This includes that no student may use, according to the SCampus, “fighting words” with which “(i) the speech, considered objectively, is abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas and (ii) it is actually used in an abusive manner in a situation that presents an actual danger.”
Regardless of how controversial or “abusive and insulting” these words might be, taking away our right to use them is a serious restriction of the First Amendment, even if USC is a private institution.
People who invoke their right to free speech are passionate about their cause, whether it be positive or negative, and as such some of their rhetoric might not be pleasant for everyone to hear and listen to.
We are students at an increasingly prestigious university with a mission that includes free inquiry and an exploration of ideas.
Thus, we cannot continue to be subject to restrictive university policies that take away the passion and complete freedom of expression that should come on a campus that promotes such a mission.
When this passion and freedom of expression does not violate the stipulation of “reasonable time, place, and manner,” which ensures that nobody is in danger and that normal everyday proceedings are not disrupted by demonstrations, all ideas should be allowed.
Of course, as people who are tolerant of other beliefs and seek to make a positive impact on the world, we should continue to make a point of exercising our First Amendment rights in ways that spark thoughtful, peaceful discussion without resorting to the bigotry and inflammatory tactics employed by groups such as Westboro Baptist Church.
Still, the Supreme Court’s consistent protection of tactics like these emphasizes the need to allow them in order to keep our own right to peaceful protest and a respectful public expression of opinion.
Although USC is a private institution, it is a place that reflects the very best of America and the world.
We should tolerate messages that we do not necessarily agree with or support. Though these messages might disgust us and be inflammatory, we are still obligated to allow them because of the First Amendment.
The point here is to push the envelope of ideas and allow free expression of what we can be exposed to as much as possible and form our own opinions.
Continuing to allow anything less would be a disservice to our great school and its intellectually curious students, an idea of which Snyder v. Phelps reminds us.
Sarah Cueva is a freshman majoring in political science.
Was ESPN wrongfully censoring Paul Shirley when he opined about Haiti? If ESPN did not take action to severe ties would they not be seen as being supportive of those thoughts? In general, I do think our society has become way too politically correct – replacing true critical thinking for easy stances that do not do not think beyond the first paper thin layers of any debate. However, If I was in charge of handing out diplomas from a prestigious institution, I feel I DO have a right and a duty NOT to give degrees to people who subscribe to certain ideas. How would you like it if the USC class of 2020 gave out hundreds of diplomas to known and open white supremacists? Education is more about developing knowledge – we forge character in institutions of higher learning and similar to USC saying you have not met the minimal GPA to graduate, USC should also have the right and duty to severe ties with people that do not represent the institution well as an active member.
The First Amendment protects U.S. citizens from government censorship.
The University of Southern California isn’t the government. Sarah, this Supreme Court caselaw does not mean USC is “obligated” to do anything it doesn’t want, nor “cannot stifle” negative speach – because USC can.
Suni Ellis
Sarah ,
Does your belief about standards of speech extend towards any  organization? For instance, should any LAPD officer be able to speak freely his or her thoughts about races? Or would certain opinions start to denigrate the entire organization that person represents as a de facto condition of simply being a member of that organization? If more Alexandra Wallaces feel free to pump out their “thoughts” how long before being blonde and having a degree from UCLA becomes a joke?

I am a USC Lambda LGBT Alumni Association board member.
I believe wholeheartedly that it is incumbent upon the Daily Trojan to provide coverage of Matt Barkley’s Twitter comment on Feb. 26 in which he pronounced that he was, “…SMH [Shaking My Head],” with regard to the Obama Administration’s subsequent refusal to continue defending the Defense of Marriage Act and of his tweet about not being a homophobe.
Every LGBT publication online reported the unfortunate comment and USC was painted in a poor light as a result.
This ignores the fact that the university is consistently rated as a top gay-friendly university by multiple publications for a decade running.
If Barkley had made the same comment about the administration’s refusal to defend a governmental policy backing a ban on interracial marriage, the proverbial “caca” would have hit the fan.
A failure to cover the issue is in my mind cowardly and journalistically unethical.
Barkley has a bit more to learn about the Trojan Family, its spirit of diversity and inclusiveness and its position of leadership in being connected to the larger City of Los Angeles (its LGBT community) and the world.
That comment might be acceptable in other places, but most definitely not in Los Angeles, and unequivocally not at USC, the home of a multitude of LGBT alumni and the ONE Institute, the largest LGBT archive in the world.
I feel that President C. L. Max Nikias needs to come out and address the issue head on.
The fact that Barkley’s a star quarterback is more, not less, reason for calling him out on his ignorance and prejudice.
Dr. Christopher Eaton
Ed.D. 2007
This is ridiculous. Christopher is talking about USC being so diverse and accepting; however, opinions on Gay Marriage cannot be diverse and we cannot be accepting of another’s opinion based on his faith? Equating Gay marriage and inter-racial marriage is preposterous.  They are completely different for obvious reasons. 
Matt is entitled to his own opinion and should not be chastised for his opinions not being perfectly aligned with LGBT’s.  Especially on his own personal website.  He is the USC quarterback, but he is also a college student.  Nowhere does it say that he cannot voice his own opinions on his website.
I wish I could come out!
Coming from an open and active LGBT student on campus, I don’t feel like USC is very gay friendly at all. More like gay tolerant. And I know I’m not the only one. This issue has come up more than once and has had entire discussion at URap, University Rap, a weekly confidential LGBT discussion group, dedicated to it. Maybe this tweet by Barkley is actually more representative of USC than we’d hope it is and that’s the most shocking part about it.
Well said Tom!
My favorite quote is, “An opinion is worth only what you pay for it… nothing”.   Matt and Christopher are entitled to their opinions and to share them equally without provocation.  Where Christopher stepped over the line is in trying to force his opinion on others by chastising Matt’s opinion.  
The truth is that regardless of USC’s proud history as a gay friendly campus and accepting all students, that the LGBT community is still a minority in the United States and that not everyone shares their beliefs for gay marriage.  The question for Christopher is why should his belief for gay marriage be pushed on others who don’t share that belief, and what entitles him to chastise those who don’t share the same beliefs?  
I personally believe that all people should be allowed the same rights and benefits regardless if they are in  heterosexual or homosexual relationships.  But I don’t believe that the word “marriage” should be forced to be used  universally for all relationships.  I have no problem with the LGBT community finding another word like “Partnership”, “Union”, etc. and have the government recognize this definition and receive all the same benefits that are allowed to a “Marriage”.  But I don’t think it is right for a minority group to push their belief that their relationship, where they can’t naturally reproduce or build a family unit with two people of the opposite sex, is the same definition of marriage that we have had for thousands of years. 
That’s my opinion, and it’s worth exactly what you paid for it.
This ultimately is the best solution to the gay “marriage issue” in my opinion as well. Let’s get government out of the picture and let the church officiate “marriage” ceremonies while the government issues civil union licenses which benefit the recipients with the legal rights that entails.
On the note of what Barkely said,  I am a strong supporter of equality (including gay rights) and at the same time also a supporter of freedom of speech. Barkely was expressing an opinion in a personal medium (person twitter account), not on behalf of USC while at a USC related press conference or through an official USC twitter account. I feel that if Barkely had in fact mentioned USC in his tweet or tried to reference that the school and student body shared his opinion, then maybe this would be a big deal and would have blown up.
After reading the Daily Trojan for years, I have noticed that there is an LGBT-related article published nearly every day.
There is no other group on campus that gets so much attention, so it seems odd to me that this author is trying to point out feeling ‘snubbed’ because there wasn’t yet another lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender piece written for the Trojan community.
When will enough be enough? Do we need a dedicated page for gender/sexual identity/preferences?
Suni Ellis
I’m hopeful that the situation will improve when there’s a new editor next year. The current one is more biased (and less skilled) than Bill Keller.
Seriously. A football player saying homophobic things is not news to anyone.
Matt is a great guy who stands up for his faith and his beliefs. He is intimately connected to many people, and he has done some incredibly generous things with his time and energy. He can (and should) say what he wants.
And I’ll say the same things here, too, as a proud USC student and member of the Trojan family: I don’t think gay people should get married. Period.
(Of course, an intelligent person would note that Matt was merely commenting on the Obama administration’s decision not to follow its constitutional duty to enforce laws. But that would be too subtle a reading for people who only ever studied how to “educate.”)
As an individual citizen, he is entitled to his opinion and the right to twitter it.
Thank goodness, so are you–score—even.

The nuclear crisis playing out before our eyes in Japan has been deemed by many a wake-up call. Some have even called it a turning point, for the future of nuclear power in the United States and around the world.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Nuclear power is on trial, with some, including Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), calling for a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants, specifically in earthquake-prone regions.
This crisis should serve as an impetus for us to evaluate the preparedness of our own nuclear power plants in the event of natural disaster or other adverse events.
Lessons learned from Japan’s crisis should also be used to improve safety standards and ensure similar crises do not occur.
We should not, however, rush to make judgments about the fate of nuclear power.
Responding to a disaster without the time, information and hindsight necessary to make an informed decision is a perfect recipe for overcompensating and turning one mishap into yet another.
Nuclear reactors have operated successfully and safely for decades in countries from the United States and France to Japan and India.
In the past 50 years, there has been only one nuclear accident that has resulted in deaths — the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.
The Chernobyl plant contained poorly designed reactors and virtually no safety procedures, very much unlike those built and operated in the United States. The plant then exploded because of a power surge. Greenpeace estimates the explosion to have caused 200,000 deaths and immeasurable environmental damage.
The infamous Three Mile Island accident in Harrisburg, PA which took place in 1979, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in United States history, was caused by a stuck valve and resulted in no deaths and no radiation leakage.
Nevertheless, nuclear plants are continuously updated and held to higher safety standards.
Plants will continue to become safer and more efficient in the future.
Rather than vilifying nuclear power, we must recognize every major energy source we have today has its own risks and downsides.
The issue at hand is not to find an immaculate, flawless source of energy, but rather to identify the source with the lowest risks and highest benefits and invest in making it even better.
At this point, nuclear power appears to be that source, at least until the green industry has a chance to develop and meet a major portion of our energy needs.
Oil and coal have had far worse records than nuclear power, both in terms of health effects and environmental impact (think BP oil spill).
Far more American workers have died in coal mine and oil drilling ones than in nuclear accidents, and this does not even account for the health effects and deaths caused by pollution from these traditional sources of energy.
Nuclear power is a clean, efficient, domestic and essentially renewable form of energy that was staging a comeback in popular opinion up until just days ago.
We should not be too quick to condemn such a valuable asset in the heat of the moment.

Exene Cervenka is a woman of two worlds.
In one is her work in the seminal punk band X, with short, fast-paced songs about society. In the other are her solo albums, with a folk rock focus and more intimate tracks.
Puzzle pieces · In the end, Exenka Cervenka’s newest album, The Excitement of Maybe, is ultimately made up of very disparate parts. - Photo courtesy of Josh Zanger  
For the most part, she’s kept these words separate, but her new album, The Excitement of Maybe, tries to strike a balance between the two.
Does it succeed? Not exactly. It’s not a punk album, and it’s not overly folky. Nor does it sound like a hybrid of the two sounds. Instead, the end result is mostly country.
It’s an unexpected genre shift, and in many cases, Cervenka fails to capitalize on it, leaving many songs feeling stilted and slightly too familiar.
But when she gets the sound right, the album soars. The Excitement of Maybe is driven by her vocals and guitar, a few weak moments aside.
Cervenka has a vocal range that reaches sadness, mirth, anger and every emotion in between.
Despite not being a concept album, The Excitement of Maybe has a strong thematic focus. Cervenka provides a somber reflection on a failed relationship with ongoing doubt over it.
It’s a simple idea, but she manages to stretch it out to a full album, creating an emotional arc that grabs the listener, even when the instrumentals falter.
To go with the uncertainty in her lyrics, Cervenka uses the motif of falling to tie things together. Beyond the track actually called “Falling,” she brings the theme up in “Brand New Memory” and “I Wish It Would Stop Raining.”
It’s a wonderfully visual idea, but at times the lyrics get lost in the somewhat jarring musical styles backing the words.
Cervenka is incredibly visual in her lyrics, painting a picture of lonesome, parched deserts or of sitting lost in doubt in a rainstorm.
Cervenka splits the album into two sections. The first half is the more remorseful side and the songs are far more somber. Starting with “Turning With the World,” she shifts her lyrical themes and instead of self-pity or doubt, relates an uncertain but optimistic attempt to get over the relationship.
Just as the lyrical focus changes midway, so does the style. The first half is an odd attempt at merging her punk and folk trappings, often throwing in different genre elements to create a hybrid.
But in the second half, she takes a turn toward an even stronger country focus. “Beyond You” and “Someday I’ll Forget” are twangy, June Cash-like numbers that, though more musically cohesive than earlier songs, are jarring in their sudden genre shift.
Once she settles on the style, however, the album grows stronger. “Half Past Forever,” “I’ll Admit It Now” and “Love and Haight” are some of the best tracks on the record, partly due to the closure permeating Cervenka’s lyrics and also due to the way she weaves the songs together instrumentally.
The album’s best moment comes in the bonus track “Long Time Ago.” The beats receive a greater focus and Cervenka’s singing resembles her more fast-paced work in X, while still keeping the lyrical themes of the album intact.
This is where her folk and punk sides seem to really come together. Instead of a slightly uncomfortable mishmash of styles, Cervenka crafts a sound more akin to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, or something along the lines of Amanda Palmer’s solo work.
As the concluding track of the album, it serves as the culmination of what she was trying to do with the record, but as it is far more successful at this than the rest of the album. It is more like a diamond among coal.
In a way, The Excitement of Maybe is like a jigsaw puzzle: The different pieces are good and could come together to make a work of art, but Cervenka just can’t put the pieces together.

News of the Week: Musicians show support for Japan
Even though Lady Gaga probably spends obnoxious amounts of time thinking up ideas for outfits, that doesn’t mean she’s completely out of the loop on world news. Gaga was among the many artists who proved their hearts aren’t only in music by designing a wristband that reads “We Pray for Japan,” priced at $5, with all proceeds going to the relief efforts in Japan. Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park also designed $25 T-shirts that will sponsor the efforts. Both products are available on the artists’ websites.

For much of the semester, this column has covered the somewhat unsavory details of our never-ending relationship with food: misguided legislature, booming obesity rates, the ethics of meat consumption — the list goes on.
These issues, though potentially confusing, divisive and frustrating, are still significant. After all, food is an integral aspect of life.
But eating is also about pure, uninhibited pleasure. There is something to be said for simply kicking back and indulging our cravings.
There’s a catch, though: How can we eat luxuriously on a college budget?
The answer lies in finding the right places at the right times. Some of Los Angeles’ hottest and most luxurious restaurants can be accessed without wrecking your bank account. Though it probably won’t be as cheap as another night of Panda Express, eating some of the best food in the city can be a value-friendly experience.
Take, for instance, Wolfgang Puck’s newest restaurant, WP24. It sits on the 24th floor of the Ritz Carlton Hotel at L.A. Live, giving diners both fantastic Asian fusion cuisine and one of the most gorgeous and expansive views of the L.A. skyline.
It was one of Esquire’s Best New Restaurants in America in 2010. It garnered three stars from the Los Angeles Times. In short, it’s a foodie’s delight.
With dinner going for $75 for three courses, however, WP24 seems out of reach for the average college student.
But it turns out you can eat spectacularly here for less than half the price of the prix-fixe dinner. Two words: lounge menu.
The lounge menu features both Chinese-influenced dishes as well as sushi, both of which are exceedingly tasty. The baby pork belly “bao buns,” for example, are nearly flawless: The pork is tender and unctuous and the bun is likely the best you’ve ever had.
The sushi is astonishingly good and better than a lot of the fusion sushi in this city. The hamachi crunch roll is a must — the fish is delicate and buttery and the chili aioli painted within knocks it out of the park.
Nearly all of these menu options are less than $20, with more expensive options being generally larger.
There are other affordable dining options, too. Much has been written (and raved) about owner Michael Cardenas and Chef Josef Centeno’s restaurant Lazy Ox Canteen in Little Tokyo.
If you haven’t heard of it, it’s about high time you did, because Centeno’s food is fearlessly tasty, with flavors quite unlike anything else around town. And with most dishes less than $20, he’s value-minded as well.
One caveat: Dinner, especially on Friday or Saturday evenings, can be a mad rush of people all looking for a table. But snagging a reservation is worth it, especially with the kitchen pumping out inventive and constantly evolving dishes.
If this is a hassle, though, try brunch. It’s still tasty, still inventive and you can still get Centeno’s lights-out Lazy Ox burger ($14), served juicy on a house-made bun with a mean green peppercorn mustard and fat, crisp fries on the side.
And finally, how could we talk about well-priced, luxurious food in Los Angeles without mentioning The Big One: Bottega Louie?
Ever since it’s conception, Bottega Louie has been one of Downtown’s dining jewels, seemingly always full of happy customers.
The restaurant doesn’t take reservations, and crowds grow to deafening, mosh-pit-like mobs Friday evenings, pushing wait times to an hour or more.
Like Lazy Ox Canteen, the dinner menu can be worth it, especially when considering the pastas and special entrées.
But if you don’t want to deal with the punishing crowds and noise inside (it’s very, very loud), brunch is again a very good option.
Lemon Ricotta pancakes? Yes, please. Slather those delicately scented and fluffy cakes with butter and drizzle with blueberry syrup and you get perfection for only $12.
And don’t forget the great egg dishes, such as the eye-popping pancetta and burrata scramble ($12). Who doesn’t love caramelized pork and explosively creamy cheese on a lazy Sunday morning?
All of these restaurants can’t be defined as “cheap,” but when done right, eating great can be a splurge, not a bankruptcy.
Los Angeles is, without a doubt, a dining destination. USC students might as well take advantage of it.
Food shouldn’t just make us full. It should delight, excite and make us crave the next great dish.
So put down the frozen chicken breast tonight and throw on some nice digs. Los Angeles is your oyster — in this case, a very tasty one.
Eddie Kim is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. His column, “Food As Life,” runs Thursdays.

Bring me the diaphragm of David Grellier. If memory is the belly of the imagination, then Grellier’s gut is swollen beyond good health, stuffed with sounds and symbols of 1980s American culture.
Stuck in the past · Northern Council demonstrates that College has not evolved when it comes to his overall compositional structure. - Photo courtesy of David Grellier 
Working under the pseudonym ‘College,’ Grellier is perhaps best known for founding France’s Valerie Collective label, a haven for blog producers including Russ Chimes and Stephen Falken, aurally pining for the world of The Breakfast Club and Tangerine Dream.
Interestingly, the best kept secret of Valerie might have been Grellier’s 2008 solo LP, a sinister soundscape of teenage desire, perversion and heartbreak called Secret Diary.
Equal parts retro pop and imaginary film score, the record was especially notable for favoring the darker, minimalist tones of the same analog synthesizers that have been more commonly employed for acid-soaked disco bashes.
It didn’t get much better than “Fantasy Park,” a sensual midnight trip through the forest guided by candlelight and Anoraak’s velvety pipes.
Now, Grellier is back with his second effort, the mysteriously titled Northern Council. Call it Secret Diary’s boorish, older brother.
The same keyboards and modules are here, but what is disappointingly absent is the throb of truth and angst that gave the tones of Grellier’s earlier work such hypnotic power.
“Incident” begins promisingly, with a ghostly synth tone that sounds lifted from John Carpenter’s 1982 Antarctic gore machine The Thing.
But before the listener can picture a bearded Kurt Russell, we are walloped with a rapid, successive riff that carries through the rest of the song, with little temporal or tonal change, to an underwhelming close that begs one question: Why?
So begins an unfortunate trend throughout the album, as Grellier takes melodies that vary from striking to stodgy and expands them into simple, three-minute tracks.
“The Zemlya Expedition” and “Express for Acelia” keep us mired in this winter wasteland of overconfidence, despite their inspired titles.
As for “Answers,” its only redeeming quality is how similar it sounds to College’s earlier, fuller-bodied “The Energy Story.”
Although Secret Diary had its share of dull songs, they were few and far between. Northern Council doesn’t pick up until its sixth, and best, track, “TWA Flight 450.” Listeners can hear Grellier moving upward from his earlier work, taking them on a romantic, instrumental airplane ride to Mars, Neptune and beyond.
For the first time on the disc, the synths pulse with something more human and soulful than the satisfaction of having programmed a workable preset.
“White Mosaic” manages to keep the flame alive, with Grellier borrowing several tinny MS-20 riffs from fellow countrymen The Teenagers and letting them fill the listener’s eardrums as though they were the corridor of a derelict high school.
“Weisberg Control” shaves the layers down to a solo drone that feels lifted from an LAX terminal, and for a few sweet moments, flies the listener away.
Indeed, the best of Northern Council is an escapist delight for those who prefer their world painted with soft brushes, but as a collective work, Grellier’s efforts are in desperate need of evolution. By now, those four note bass riffs that sounded extracted from the sewer of adolescence on Secret Diary have grown glaringly familiar, as have Grellier’s favored song structures.
What’s missing here is a sense of relevance and passion. Nostalgia alone is no guarantor of an interesting artistic path.
The best outfits in contemporary music lift sounds from eras past — think Cut Copy’s recent Zonoscope — and move beyond the bars of their youth to carve something important from their own experiences.
Grellier has been around the world and worked with enough musicians to have the propensity for a maturer, meatier album, but with Northern Council he has retreated further back into a bedroom festooned with Molly Ringwald posters and Roland hardware. For an LP so serious and non-club friendly, this is a very ill-advised move.
Consider the album’s final number, “Simon’s Past.” What Simon is Grellier referring to? The American Idol judge? William Golding’s young martyr in Lord of the Flies?
The song’s vague robot tones tell us nothing, so I would like to propose this: For the cover of album number three, a severed pig’s head with buzzing flies, superimposed over a neon Macintosh screensaver. Sure, it’s pretentious, but at this stage in the College discography, a little blood and audacity wouldn’t hurt.

‘Food Truck Wars,’ the name of the event coming to The Row tomorrow, is a misnomer; in this war, everybody is a winner. The only conflict will be debating which food truck to visit first.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
Friday from 3 to 9 p.m., 10 food trucks (including bacon-daredevil Lardon and fries-aficionado Frysmith) will be serving up their signature dishes all along The Row. Each truck will also offer a special “secret menu” featuring a USC theme.
The Food Truck Wars, organized by The Dish Dash team, the USC Interfraternity Council and the USC Panhellenic Council, is a six-hour philanthropic feast-a-thon.
Word about Food Truck Wars started spreading mid-February when The Dish Dash asked on its Twitter page: “What is USC’s #foodtruckwars?”
“That was when we started getting a lot of buzz,” said Tracy Lawrence, a senior majoring in business administration and founder of The Dish Dash Los Angeles, a downtown dining deal guide for USC students. “We immediately got tons of tweets from people asking us what the Food Truck Wars was.”
Chip Clement, a sophomore majoring in business administration and vice president of Philanthropy for IFC, worked on the charitable side of the event.
“I’ve always had a passion for philanthropy and been heavily involved in charity,” Clement said.
Lawrence’s organizations The Dish Dash, targets the Greek community. Looking back on past philanthropic events, Lawrence felt it would be a good idea to host a large-scale event. She reached out to Clement for help with connecting to charities and the Greek community.
Clement first selected six downtown-based non-profit organizations, and then let students vote on the two charities that will receive 20 percent of that night’s proceeds.
The two winners were Paws/LA, a group that provides help for disenfranchised pet owners, and The Union Rescue Mission, a Christian organization that serves the homeless.
The trucks will be divided into two sides of the street. The east will represent Paws/LA and the west will represent The Union Rescue Mission.
Clement said The Union Rescue Mission will be setting up a booth by The Row on Friday to talk to students. Negotiations are still under way with Paws/LA to bring some of the dogs to the event.
Lawrence said she hopes the Food Truck Wars is will benefit  the charities, the food truck vendors, The Dish Dash and the students.
A born-and-raised Angeleno who is proud of her city’s cuisine, Lawrence said she is always thinking of creative and modern ways to encourage students to appreciate the gastronomical experiences right at their doorstep.
“I’m excited about getting students enthusiastic about L.A. cuisine Downtown,” Lawrence said. “Students will drive out to Hollywood and Santa Monica, but they won’t even explore their own backyard.”
But The Dish Dash will unlock the richness of downtown to students, Lawrence said. Since its launch in August 2010, The Dish Dash has increased from seven partner restaurants to 13. Users have also doubled from 800 to 1600, and subscribers to its weekly online newsletter has grown to 2,500.
But Lawrence has bigger plans in the works. This month, The Dish Dash went mobile. And what better way to showcase its mobility than the food trucks, which made their names by engaging the community through social media like Twitter and Facebook?
For students to order off the “secret menu” Friday, they first have to sign up for The Dish Dash online and “add a Dash” to their phone. It is all part of a marketing strategy to get students used to The Dish Dash functions.
Like The Dish Dash, the food trucks are also eager to build relationships with the USC community.
Clement said he is expecting the event to draw a good-sized crowd. He anticipates Food Truck Wars will become an annual event.
“I’ve talked to a lot of people and they’re all really excited about it,” he said. “If we sell out before 9 p.m., I’ll consider that a huge success.”
Let the feasting battle begin.
I’m there.
This is truly a GREAT university!  Uh, gimme the Chinese tacos, the Mexican noodles, and some of those Italian onion rings….

On March 14, Michael Messner, an expert in the sociology of sports at the USC College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, spoke to Ms. Magazine about the lack of coverage of women’s sports in the media.
He has been collecting research on the prevalence of women’s sports in the media, and comparing the coverage to past years. He found that during the three to five minute sports-news segments of LA’s three TV networks in 1989, only 5 percent was devoted to women’s sports, and that rate held through 1993. It spiked to 9 percent in 1999, but dipped to 6.3 percent in 2004 and slumped to nearly 1.5 percent in 2009.
Messner concluded that compared to the huge growth of women’s sports teams, especially in college, in the past decade, women’s sports coverage is woefully disproportionate. According to Messner’s 2010 survey, 99.1 percent of colleges have a women’s basketball team. Furthermore the USC women’s basketball team is a consistent leader in the Pac-10 conference.
Alex Luizzi, a junior majoring in psychology, said he simply watches men’s sports because it is more prominent on TV.
“The only reason I watch men’s sports more often is because it’s publicized more often and it’s usually what’s on,” said Alex Luizzi, a Junior in Psychology. “You never see women’s sports on the top headlines.”

Undergraduate Student Government President-elect Monish Tyagi and Vice President-elect Logan Lachman announced their 2010-11 executive officers at Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
Current sitting Performing Arts Director Nikki Anas will be chief of staff; sitting Public Relations Director Sabena Suri will be director of communication; sitting Philanthropy Director Elton Kwok will be treasurer; sitting Trojan Pride Director Danielle Espinoza will be Program Board’s executive director; and sitting Production Director and former vice presidential candidate Andy Greos will be Program Board’s finance director.
Tyagi and Lachman interviewed applicants the week before spring break and finalized their list March 13. They received about 20 applications for the five positions.
“It was very competitive; we had a lot of great applicants, and it was a really tough decision to make,” Lachman said.
Tyagi said they considered a number of qualities when picking their cabinet.
“For each of the positions we wanted to consider how prepared, experienced and ready they were for that position,” Tyagi said. “The second thing we considered was the personalities and how the team would work together. We really wanted to see how their leadership style would work together as a team.”
Tyagi said his platform, which primarily focused on USG improving its programs and retaining its structure, was not the primary motivator in choosing the members of the executive board.
“We knew what our goals were for each of the positions and we knew what we were expecting,” Tyagi said. “We asked them if there was something they’d like to change about the position or USG in general, but it didn’t necessarily play a factor in the process.”
Current President Chris Cheng has been giving Tyagi and Lachman advice on choosing the officers as part of the general transition process. Lachman said he told them to aim for a “good office morale.”
“You want people who are hard workers and people who are going to work well together because you spend a significant amount of time together,” Cheng said. “Individually, you want people to have their own merits, but it’s all about the team dynamic. That’s what we focused on this year and it worked out really well for us.”
The executive board will start interviewing and selecting committee leaders for USG, though the executive board will not take office April 1.
“Everyone is getting along very well and doing what they are supposed to be doing; we’re very happy with who we chose,” Lachman said.

Despite the national trends of young college graduates taking more federal government and non-profit jobs, not much change has been seen at USC, according to Angie Wood, director of Employer Relations and Research at the Career Planning and Placement Center.
“We haven’t seen that trend in terms of companies that are requesting to participate in our [programs],” Wood said.
According to an analysis by The New York Times of data from the American Community Survey of the United States Census Bureau from 2009, 16 percent more young college graduates worked for the federal government than in the previous year and 11 percent more worked for non-profit groups. A smaller survey by the Labor Department showed the share of educated young people in these jobs continued to rise last year.
Applications for AmeriCorps, a federally funded organization for the advancement of communities across the country, positions have nearly tripled to 258,829 in 2010 from 91,399 in 2008, while the number of Teach for America applications climbed 32 percent last year to 46,359.
Although the majority of recruiters who visit USC are from Fortune 500 companies, USC does host a large number of non-profit recruiters.
TFA is one of the largest non-profit recruiters on campus, according to Wood.
“It’s interesting that although we have so many for-profits, we still have someone like TFA recruit heavily here on campus,” Wood said. “I think students are consciously making that choice to give back and work for service type or non-profit jobs.”
Becca Ryan, a senior majoring in neuroscience, was selected to work with TFA in New Orleans. Ryan always knew she would like to work for a nonprofit.
“I think with a decrease in jobs, more people are looking toward TFA or graduate programs,” Ryan said. “It’s a good opportunity to take two years in the real world working and have leniency to figure out what to do.”
Branche Foston, a senior majoring in communication, is looking to work for a nonprofit after graduation as well, before pursuing a PhD.
“I want to take some time off from school to work with nonprofits because that is what brings me the most joy,” Foston said.
Foston said he doesn’t believe working in the non-profit sector is or should be the easy and secure alternative to getting a for-profit job, as they are struggling in this economy as well.
“Most nonprofits run off of many donations,” Foston said. “If they’re struggling because people are donating less due to the recession, then there’s no guaranteed way for you to have a job, let alone be paid.”
CPPC and the USC Alumni Association, in partnership with MyWorkster, held a USC Alumni career fair last week.
The fair featured nearly 50 employers, but only a handful were in the non-profit or public sector.
You know, USC is getting so weak. Deleting my comments because these spineless editors at DT don’t want the ugly truth to be told. Why is that? Afraid that less students will apply to USC if they see that SC isn’t impervious to the bad economy. Is the “SC connection” the silver bullet in this uphill economy? It only works for a select few, but not for most Trojans. People from more prestigious schools don’t have it much better; I know, because I personally know people from schools like Yale and UPenn who can’t land a job these days. Or do you think that only alumni from public universities suffer?..You’re not fooling anyone.
Listen listen listen listen…I graduated last May. I still keep in touch with a few individuals whom I graduated with, and we got the same major under our belts. Some of my friends got higher GPAs than me, did more interviews, interns, etc. and none of these people I keep in touch with have careers related to their majors nor are they making money according to their “worth.” 
The job market is not pretty even now as we speak; don’t buy into what the WSJ or newspapers say. Take all that with a grain of salt. 
If a non-profit opportunity comes your way, you better not balk and think “I’m too good for this” or “I deserve more money” blah blah blah. 
You better suck it up, be humble, take that “crappy” job and make the most out it..or suck it up until a better opportunity comes by. 
When the economy recovers, the game is going to be a lot different than it was “pre-2007.” You better have an open mind and be prepared for what’s new.
I find it hard to buy the claim that fewer USC students are interested in the non-profit sector just because only a few out of 50 employers at the job fair were non-profits. The comparison between the New York Times’ analysis, which shows which jobs students take, and  yours, which shows which employers visit USC, is weak.
In fact, you could make the argument that for-profits coming to campus in greater numbers is an indication that they are in LESS demand among students. Why should they have to come to campus if students are seeking those jobs anyway?
It might actually be true that USC students are more interested in for-profits than the national average, but I don’t think the analysis provided in this article proves it.
Good point. This analysis sucked.
Still, USC students are smart enough not to waste their time at non-profits.

Testing of the new Exposition Line, a light rail line that will run down Exposition Boulevard, around the USC campus and eventually reach Santa Monica, is set to begin in April, Metro officials announced this month.
Trial · A truck pushed a mock train car down the Metro Exposition line tracks Tuesday morning to check for potential safety hazards. Tests involving a real train are scheduled to occur in April. Metro officials say the line will reach Santa Monica in 2015. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
The test will begin on Exposition Boulevard. A truck with train wheels will run the line, and this will continue for several months and subsequently lead to opening the line to the public.
The Metro Expo Line will be completed by November, according to Metro officials. The line, which will begin at 7th Street and Figueroa Street, will travel to Culver City and provide an alternative public transportation option for USC students, faculty and members of the surrounding community.
The line was supposed to be completed by Summer 2010, but was pushed back because of logistical issues in Culver City such as difficulty in installing platforms.
Metro officials and USC transportation officials met last Tuesday to discuss the status of the project, and Anthony Mazza, director of USC Transportation, said both parties are confident the completion date of November 2011 will be achieved.
“When you have conversations with Metro, nothing is set in stone,” Mazza said. “But I think they are excited about it being in November, as well, and are just as disappointed that it was delayed.”
Mazza said USC has been in talks with Metro about safety near the intersection of 7th and Figeuroa, where the line will start.
The station at 7th and Figueroa is the transfer station downtown where the Metro rail lines and the Expo line meet.
“We’ve solicited a lot of help with people who have had experience in the past with Metro to assist us in safety aspects for the crossing from 7th and Figueroa,” Mazza said.
The light rail will run at times when the USC shuttle that travels to the Health Sciences Campus, University Park Campus and Union Station does not. Moreover, the light rail will allow students to easily access downtown Los Angeles.

“I do think that the light rail is going to give students a great opportunity to visit downtown in a very inexpensive, safe manner,” Mazza said. “I think at the same time, it will give students a chance to go up to Culver City, which is a nice area to explore. It’ll be a great addition for USC.”
According to the Exposition Line website, officials predict that by the year 2030, more than 64,000 passengers will be riding the Expo Line daily.
Students have expressed excitement about the rail line.
Alexander Blow, an undeclared freshman, said he feels the line will be beneficial if gas prices continue to rise.
“I would totally use [the Expo Line],” Blow said. “It will be beneficial to those who don’t have a car and can’t afford gas prices.”
Sidhant Gandhi, a freshman majoring in business administration, said that he was excited for more flexible hours, as well as cheap fare.
“The price is a solid point to me,” Gandhi said. “Yeah, there are shuttles that go to L.A. Live, but that’s only on the weekends. The line will provide alternatives.”
Too bad about the delays, but why dwell on them?
Expo Line will be here for USC-UCLA!
Actually, its more likely to open in September than November. November is just a placeholder for the absolute latest.
You have a source on that? I’ve been having a problem finding any information other than the november 15th date. I think everyone would love it if they opened closer to the beginning of the semester.
I can’t wait for this line to open up!  It’s too bad it’s been delayed, but now it’s only months away.  I can’t wait to start taking it and get out of my car!
Supposed to open in summer 2010. Supposed to open in fall 2010. Supposed to open in summer 2011. Now supposed to open in fall 2011. Get your act together, Metro.
Its not Metro’s Fault its the contractor’s fault. The contractor (FCI) dropped the ball.  They bid this job for metro and did not know what they were getting themselves into.  Piss poor job they did too.
LAweekly blog states the target open date is Nov 15th per a metro budget document.
