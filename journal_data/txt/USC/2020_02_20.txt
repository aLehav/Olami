At times, watching “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” is like sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour sex scene with your parents — painful, awkward and deeply, deeply uncomfortable. I have seen the play twice, across two Shakespeare festivals, and never have I felt more embarrassed while sitting next to strangers in a theater. But, while it may have been horny, chaotic and, yes, occasionally uncomfortable, it was also incredibly funny, joyous and fresh despite the script being well over 400 years old. The students of the School of Dramatic Arts’ Masters of Fine Arts program delivered the most over-the-top rendition I have ever seen. With a show like this one, I can think of no higher praise.
For those of you who did not read it in high school, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” follows a group of unlucky mortals stuck in a fairy-infested forest outside ancient Athens, Greece. Hermia (Deja Thompson) and Lysander (Sherrick O’Quinn) are fleeing the city to get married, while Hermia’s betrothed Demetrius (Brent Grimes) tries to stop them; Hippolyta (Abigail Coryell) is after Demetrius, who is far more interested in getting his fianceé back; and a troupe of players (led by Austen Parros as Bottom) is attempting to rehearse a play for the duke.
The complicated setup basically boils down to a love triangle (or square, I guess) caused by a misplaced love spell from the fairy Puck (Nona Johnson). Most productions give the proceedings a light-hearted, rom-com vibe, which seems appropriate given the premise. But Professors of Theater Practice Andrei Belgrader and Natsuko Ohama, who adapted the play, chose to do something different: less “Sleepless in Seattle” and more “Wet Hot American Summer.”
That’s not a comparison I had expected to make when I walked into the theater, but I don’t think there’s a better one. The performances are exaggerated — the cast goes for more slapstick humor than wit or nuance. There’s a lot of falling over, pantomime fighting and more choreographed dance numbers than I would have expected (there’s only one, but I wasn’t expecting any.) It’s all loud self-caricature, which might have gotten on my nerves had I not been so busy laughing.
As in all versions, “Midsummer” folds in on itself at the end; the entire final act is occupied by a play-within-a-play, performed by the troupe of actors rehearsing in the woods. This performance, however, doesn’t just fold — it comes apart, adding new elements to the script. I won’t go into specifics here because you should see it for yourself, but it’s just as strange and funny as the rest of the performance.
The entire cast does an impressive job, especially considering they’re all performing three separate plays a week as part of their thesis project, but Parros was one of the clear standouts. He has one of the more ostentatious roles, playing Bottom as a scenery-chewing old Hollywood film star. Although hers was a much smaller role, Lea Lanoue got a lot of laughs as another one of the troupe’s inept actors. 
The most spectacular performance, though, was Troy Witherspoon’s Oberon. He strutted around the stage with a sort of unnervingly quiet, laid-back anger, as though “Dazed and Confused” era Matthew McConaughey had taken a role as the King of the Faeries. His was certainly a melodramatic turn, but, unlike the rest of the cast, Witherspoon never tried for a laugh.
None of the changes — or performances, for that matter — are radically different on their own. The script is still the same, with only a few anachronistic lines added for comedic effect. The sets are non-existent, like usual, and the costumes fall within the “grab whatever you want from the rack” look of so many Shakespearean productions these days (at least the cast didn’t go for the even more overdone “vaguely military” look.)
But when taken all together, the changes add up. The jokes land more often and the lines become less stuffy. The show is grosser and sillier and, at times, dumber than any I have ever seen. And I couldn’t recommend it more.
The play runs on select nights through March 7, sharing the stage with “Father Comes Home from the War” and “Guarded,” both with the same cast.

Brad Keller has been named head coach of the USC women’s volleyball team, athletic director Mike Bohn announced Thursday.
The move comes after former USC head coach Brent Crouch unexpectedly resigned from his position on Jan. 14 to take over the same role at Auburn University.
Keller served as an associate head coach of UCLA’s women’s volleyball team in 2019, and had spent the previous six seasons working as an assistant coach of the Bruins’ men’s team.
Keller was also an assistant coach for the Trojan men’s team from 2007-10. 
“This is a dream for me,” Keller said in a press release Thursday. “I started at USC, so it’s so nice to be back here. This is a very exciting time and I can’t wait to start working with this team to build on USC’s incredible women’s volleyball tradition.”
Keller helped lead the Bruins to a 19-12 record in 2019, advancing to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The men’s program saw 10 All-Americans over the course of Keller’s tenure as assistant coach, and the Bruins earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament semifinal in 2016 as well as a 2018 runner-up finish. 
Keller’s staff consistently reeled in elite recruiting classes while with the UCLA men’s program, helping land the No. 1 ranked class in 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2018, according to Volleyball Magazine’s rankings.
“We are very excited to welcome Brad back to the Trojan Family,” Bohn said in the press release. “His mastery of the Southern California recruiting landscape will be a difference-maker for our program. He brings a strong coaching pedigree and has coached the game at a national-caliber level.”
Included in his experienced resume, Keller was on the coaching staff of the U.S. Youth National Team from 2014-17 and took home second place at the NORCECA U19 Continental Championship in 2018.
Keller has seen success with the Trojans as well. In 2009, his men’s team won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament en route to a second-place finish in the NCAA Tournament.
Now, Keller is back with USC, where he hopes to revitalize a program that went 40-25 in Crouch’s two seasons and got booted from the NCAA Tournament in the second round both years.
“He is a great fit for USC, and he embraces our aspirations to reclaim USC’s rich volleyball heritage,” Bohn said. “He has a deep passion for the game of volleyball and believes in our student-athlete centric model.”

President Carol Folt announced Thursday that USC will make tuition free for students with a family income of $80,000 or less. This change, along with the decision to not consider homeownership when determining a student’s financial need, is expected to benefit low- and middle-income families, according to USC.
According to a news release from Folt’s office, the new policy will increase undergraduate aid by more than $30 million annually and will take effect for students of the Class of 2024 and later. It is expected to impact more than 4,000 students once implemented.
“When it’s fully implemented, $30 million a year or more … should translate directly into students’ pockets and into their families,” Folt said. “I believe that their loan debt will go down, and I think it will really encourage and make some students who would really like to come here able to come here.”
For current students, financial aid  is determined on a case-by-case basis. Homeownership was counted as an asset and used as a factor for determining financial aid for each student. The policy change will ensure that housing is not a factor when making aid determinations. Removing house ownership as a factor means that a standardized process will be used in determining aid, Folt said. 
“If you take the house out of that equation, it means that students can get more aid,” Folt said. “It produces a burden on families because we understand that your house is something that they fight hard to get and so we wanted that to be an important aspect of our plan.”
Folt said one of her priorities is to increase affordability and accessibility at USC, which is a goal she hopes to achieve with the implementation of the financial aid plan. 
“I’m very determined and committed to making sure that we are able to educate students, independent of their background or ability to pay, and this is an important step to continue in that direction,” she said. 
According to the news release, USC’s undergraduate students currently receive more than $640 million in aid funds from all sources for tuition and expenses. The University’s need-based grant funding has been expanded by more than 60% since 2010. Currently, more than 21% of undergraduates are from low-income families and two-thirds of students receive financial aid.
Provost Charles Zukoski, Vice President for Admissions and Planning Katharine Harrington, the Office of Financial Aid and academic deans also worked toward the new policy, according to the news release. 
Folt said the University will continue its need-blind policy when admitting students to USC alongside the changes to the financial aid policy.

USC Housing installed 40 composting bins across residential colleges Wednesday after a pilot program led by student volunteers to introduce the sustainable practice into residents’ routines last year. The residential colleges include Parkside Apartments, Webb Tower Residential College, Nemirovsky and Bohnett Residential College, New North Residential College, Marks Tower, Marks Hall, Trojan Hall, Cardinal ‘n Gold and Troy East/Troy Hall. 
The campaign began with a pilot program led by last year’s USG director of sustainability affairs, Catherine Atkinson. The student-run study was conducted at Cardinal Gardens and Nemirovsky Residential College to identify students’ interest in implementing a compost program. 
According to Isabella Caltabiano, USG’s current director of sustainability affairs, USC Housing wished to only place compost bins in the residential colleges to assess how students would interact with the new initiative. 
“You definitely can’t start rolling out a brand new thing all at once, everywhere,” Caltabiano said. “Could you imagine if something goes wrong? … I hope that in the future, USC will be composting in all its residential colleges and lining up with the Sustainability 2028 Goals.”
The Sustainability 2028 Plan, which is still being formulated, will provide guidelines for students, faculty, staff and senior administrators to progress campus sustainability through water conservation, waste diversion and energy conservation efforts similar to the 2020 sustainability plan. The plan encourages collaboration with various teams on campus, including Facilities Management Services, Transportation Services, Auxiliary Services and student government. 
Auxiliary Services Sustainability Administrator Nichelle Mitchell-Huizar, who collaborated with Atkinson on the composting initiative, said the pilot program comprised of eight students who voluntarily composted over a six-week period, diverting 50 pounds of food away from landfills. Mitchell-Hulzar said the initial success motivated the team to expand composting to the rest of campus. “We can get our recycling together, and we can get the waste stream together,” Mitchell-Huizar said. “We can just be contributing on a daily basis without a super effort because everybody thinks it’s a task to be sustainable.”
According to Jerry Lewis, associate director of administration and sustainability for USC Housing, before the pilot program, the composting system was not installed along with recycling and trash bins because there would be limited student engagement with composting bins. Lewis said the new composting bins are placed in freshman residential halls so students learn the importance of composting early and continue to practice composting beyond their year in the dorms.
Lewis said flyers containing information about the new composting bins system will be emailed to every student in the seven residential colleges. The email will contain a QR code for a form students can fill out to express interest in the compost initiative and request that USC Housing delivers compost bins to their residences.
USC Housing plans to spread awareness on the newly implemented composting bins through flyers and magnets. 
Grace Martinez, a senior majoring in public relations, designed the magnets that illustrate which products would be categorized as recycling, compost or waste. According to Mitchell-Huizar, the magnets will be placed on the students’ refrigerators during semesterly USC Housing room checks. 
Student sustainability advocate Nicole Bakar will lead a booth at the Trojan Farmers Market on Wednesdays to teach students how to use the new compost bins. She said she’s glad that the University is slowly increasing sustainability initiatives in student housing. 
“I feel like we’ve honestly been quite behind [on climate change] as such an extravagant top-20 university, and it’s really cool that we’re finally making a change,” said Bakar, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “We’ll be happy with the baby steps … We’re really working on separating instead of contaminating and fully increasing the awareness of students because that’s honestly the root of it.”
Lewis said the biggest challenge USC Housing faces is the logistics behind the different residential colleges, including questions on the appropriate frequency of compost bin collection. However, Lewis said he believes the problem needs further monitoring through the next few months before it can be resolved. Along with the logistical clarifications, he said that there should be strong communication with individuals involved to help the program succeed.
“[Another barrier is] getting everybody on the same page,” Lewis said. “From custodians to the housing managers to even the other [associate directors] that control the area.”
With the Sustainability 2028 Plan in mind, Lewis hopes the composting system will continue to expand on campus. 
“Eventually, every location that USC has — whether it’s managed by staff or managed by students or residents or education facilities — will have a location you can compost,” Lewis said. “I’d probably say in the next year, every housing location that USC has will have the ability to compost.”

Vice President of Softlines and Franchise for Disney Animation, Pixar and Princess Melissa Lasdon discussed her experience working with brands and filmmakers to create products that reflect the company film franchise Tuesday. 
More than 50 students attended the event at Wallis Annenberg Hall to learn about the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumna’s career experiences as part of the Annenberg Career and Development office’s Lunch with a Leader series. 
Lasdon started the conversation by sharing her experience applying to a Disney internship through a career fair on Trousdale Parkway her senior year. After interviewing with the company and receiving an offer, she considered rejecting the position, but her boss at the public relations firm she was working for at the time encouraged her to accept it.
“I said, ‘Hey, Disney called. They’ve offered me this job, I’m going to turn it down. What do you think?’” Lasdon said. “And [my boss] looked at me, and I will never forget this for the rest of my life: ‘You will learn more at Disney in six months than you did four years in college. You should go take the job and call me when you’re done’ … That was the moment that made me decide it’s OK to take the risk.”
Lasdon said her interest in consumer products attracted her to a franchise role at the Walt Disney Company. She said she especially enjoys extending viewers’ Disney film experience through consumer products such as T-shirts and figurines, a job that she accomplishes in tandem with filmmakers. 
“Being able to work with filmmakers is pretty amazing,” Lasdon said. “I get the opportunity to sit with them sometimes, and I’m in awe of their talent, and I feel very privileged to be trusted with how [we are going to] create a great product collection … that reflects what you’re seeing on screen.”
Lasdon also gave advice to students on building their resumes. She said that when evaluating job applications, she looks for individuals who would complement her team with applicable skills such as social media experience. She urged students to be prepared to portray their resume skills during in-person interviews. 
“When you build your resume, there’s obviously key words … but it’s also making sure that you can speak to it in the interview,” Lasdon said. “Make sure it’s things that you are passionate about.”
Lasdon shared her experience as an undergraduate at Annenberg, especially as a senior who was unsure whether she would have a job after college. She advised students to be confident in their skill sets and consider venturing into career paths they have not considered. 
“I was so worried and set on [a career in public relations],” Lasdon said. “There are so many tracks. There’s so many things to do, and be open to those and have the confidence — you’re going to land [a job].”
Ally Chen, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she related to Lasdon’s personal experience as an undergraduate at USC and appreciated the advice Lasdon gave on exploring career options after graduation. 
“I can really empathize with … the anxiety or fear about a nonfuture after graduation,” Chen said. “I think what she said about her experience really encouraged me to view myself with a growth mindset because … it’s OK if I don’t know things right now.”
After interning at Disney for five months, Lasdon received a part-time job at the company. Six months later, she was offered a full-time entry-level job in the consumer products division. Lasdon said she had these opportunities not only because she was in the right place at the right time but also because she took initiative, independently picking up extra tasks.
“I always looked for [ways to help the company] and I think that was part of how I was saying to [Disney that] I want to stay,” Lasdon said. “When I started to feel like I’m doing my job really well and the feedback from them is, ‘You’ve got this,’ I [would respond with], ‘Can I take something else on?’ My personal philosophy is doing the next job before you get it.
Lasdon encouraged students to find academic and professional mentors to help guide them through their next steps.
“Mentorship is critical,” Lasdon said. “It shouldn’t stop when you leave ‘SC. Having mentors [makes] such a big difference. I can’t tell you how many people I know have gotten jobs because of their mentors and have come out of moments of ‘can I do this?’ … It’s not about an abundance of [mentors]. It’s about the right ones.”

Students dressed in blue carried signs saying “Uyghur rights are human rights” and “Cultural Genocide” at a campus demonstration aimed at bringing attention to the injustices suffered by Chinese Uyghurs. The event was organized by Delta Phi Epsilon, an international relations and foreign service fraternity.
More than 30 students joined the 30-minute walk from Tutor Campus Center to USC Village chanting “What do we want? Human rights. When do we want them? Now.” and “What do we want? Justice. Who is it for? Uyghurs.” Attendees were encouraged to dress in blue in honor of the East Turkestan flag.
Humanitarian Affairs Vice President Breana Stanski said the organization decided to bring attention to the cause after briefly studying it in international relations classes. Students were frustrated that their classes didn’t go into much detail about the injustices.
“We all feel very strongly about the injustices that Ughyurs are facing in Western China,” said Stanski, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “By devoting an entire week to study the subject, it means that we’re able to learn more about what’s happening and advocate for what’s right and for our legislators to make a difference.”
The event was organized as part of DPE’s Week of Action to raise awareness about Uyghurs being placed in Chinese concentration camps, which has included fundraising for the advocacy group Uyghur Human Rights Project. The project will place pressure on legislators to take a stance against China, and organize a professional panel with experts on China and human rights to discuss Xinjiang and the future of the Uyghurs.
Stanski said the number of Uyghurs in concentration camps has increased exponentially since 2017, and a number of atrocities were committed against the Uyghurs including sexual abuse, young girls getting injected with serums to stop their periods and men being forced to trim their beards. 
“There is actually a lot of surveillance going on,” Stanski said. “Chinese officials are being placed into their houses and if they, for example, do something that is considered extremist such as fasting for Ramadan, then they get placed in a camp. It’s really horrific what’s going on in and outside of the camps within Xinjiang.”
Sean Liew, a senior majoring in international relations, said he suggested focusing on the Uyghur issue to Stanski and other members because it had not received much attention, especially internationally, because countries have been afraid of how it would affect their economic ties with China. 
“A lot of countries are afraid to speak out on [the Uyghurs’] behalf for fear of repercussion from the CCP,” Liew said. “I think, whether it’s Hong Kong or the Uyghurs or Tibet or anywhere, it’s the same teams, the same fight — human rights.”
Liew said that raising awareness on the issue was necessary since governments, companies and organizations were afraid to do so, and if students didn’t take a stance, nobody else would. 
“All these students here today who are coming out, we all have [classes], we all have better things that we could be doing,” Liew said. “At the end of the day, I think the most important thing is to be able to go to bed at night knowing that you did the right thing.”
Thomas Kim, a senior majoring in international relations, said he joined the demonstration because of the lack of conversation about the genocide taking place in China and hoped they could bring more attention to the issue.
“I felt just by being a part of this demonstration, if we can make one more person more aware about the issue, that we will have done our job,” Kim said. 
DPE President Jong Su Kim ended the demonstration by thanking everyone for attending and doing their part in raising awareness for the cause. 
“I think we’re really setting a good precedent as an organization,” Kim said. “We all study these issues, we all study human rights, international law. When there’s injustice happening somewhere, even though all we can do is wear blue and march around, we should at least do that.”

The USC men’s volleyball team is looking to snap its five-game losing streak Thursday as it faces No. 12 Stanford at Maples Pavilion in Stanford, Calif. Going into the second consecutive week of MPSF matches, the Trojans remain winless within the conference at 0-4 while Stanford is coming off two straight losses to No. 1 Hawaii. 
With so many players on the roster graduating after last year’s strong campaign, the Trojans have struggled to find their rhythm throughout the season. With less experience has come more difficulties, as the roster now consists of only one senior and 15 underclassmen. 
“Last year’s team, when we played against Lewis, of the 96 points we scored, 93 of them were by the three starting pins from last year that graduated,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “What’s happening is that guys are learning to play under the lights. Guys are learning how to apply a game plan.”
Although the team has gone through a big change in player leadership, Nygaard emphasized the importance of growth and learning to mature — win or lose.
“There’s only one way to learn under the lights,” Nygaard said. “And that’s to be under the lights and do it.”
Nygaard said that the team’s motto was “brotherhood” and that the Trojans have focused on it through the struggles.
“They’re still bought in, they’re still going hard, they’re still learning,” Nygaard said. “We recognize where we’re at, we recognize what we need to get better at and they’re willing to do it. The brotherhood is like — there’s no quit here.”
Despite the subpar start, the Trojans have seen some bright spots this season. The team has proven to be very strong at the net, averaging 12.2 kills per set. Sophomore outside and opposite hitter Billy Fauntleroy leads the team with 2.91 kills per set and 3.29 points per set. 
Although USC holds a 66-34 all-time record against Stanford, the Trojans will head into the match as underdogs with an overall record of 3-11. Still, the Trojans look to continue developing against the No. 12 team.
“[Fans] can expect us to exhibit that we’re learning,” Nygaard said. “We’re still bought in, we’re still the brotherhood, we’re gonna go out there and represent ourselves with our chins held high and our chests out and our shoulders back.”
The largest discrepancy between USC and Stanford seems to be in blocking: USC averages 1.3 blocks per set with opponents averaging 2.7 blocks per set, while Stanford averages 2.2 blocks per set with opponents averaging 2.1. 
Although Stanford poses a significant challenge Thursday, USC will face an even bigger test this weekend as it stays on the road Saturday to face off against No. 2 Brigham Young, which has stayed undefeated after victories over Grand Canyon University, No. 8 Pepperdine, No. 7 UCLA and No. 3 UCSB.
Thursday’s match with Stanford will begin at 7 p.m. and Saturday’s battle with BYU in Provo, Utah will start at 6 p.m.

Like a lazy Tuesday night on FX, we have all seen this movie before.
USC basketball flexes its recruiting might, touts a number of the West’s brightest young stars, banks on the promise of a nice record and an opportunity for the seizing — then the wheels fall off completely.
Over the past few years, USC has managed to avoid qualifying for the NCAA Tournament in often painful fashion. After a nice run in 2016-17 that left the Trojans just short of the Sweet 16, USC was snubbed from the tournament in 2017-18 despite a 24-12 record. Then the team saw all hell break loose and finished 16-17 last season.
The common thread in this failure? Andy Enfield’s USC teams have a fundamental opposition to finishing strong.
Through good and bad years alike, Enfield has struggled mightily in the month of February when conference play heats up and the selection committee really starts to take note of all the shortcomings of tournament hopefuls. Since taking over in 2013-14, Enfield carries a ghastly 16-34 record in each season’s final month, and this stat has done more than impact your local bar’s trivia night.
In many ways, the Enfield-era’s failure to finish is keeping USC basketball from taking the much-needed next step toward becoming a respected basketball program: consistent tournament placement.
Certainly, considering the talent, USC basketball should be reaching far greater heights. According to 247 Sports, USC had the seventh-best recruiting class in the nation in 2019, headlined by freshmen forwards Isaiah Mobley, Max Agbonkpolo and projected lottery pick Onyeka Okongwu. Factoring in the addition of productive transfers redshirt senior guards Daniel Utomi and Quinton Adlesh, all signs pointed to USC rising from a simple March Madness participant to a potential national title contender.
All that said, it is often important to walk before running, and making the tournament is a necessary step toward becoming a consistently relevant basketball program. Considering the work that assistant coach Eric Mobley and others have done to increase USC’s profile, it is imperative that the momentum on the court keeps up with that of the recruiting trail.
By all means, USC has not had too poor of a season. Impressive wins over LSU and Stanford — as well as the closest thing to a quality loss in a double-overtime defeat in Eugene against Oregon — highlight a resume for a team seeking an NCAA tourney berth. As we’ve witnessed in the past, however, all those accomplishments can be washed away with a poor showing in February, and thus far, it has been a mixed bag for the men’s squad. After solid showings in back-to-back wins against Oregon State and Utah, the Trojans were demolished by Colorado before being swept in their two-game Arizona road trip.
Heading into its final road trip before the Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas, USC has a chance once again to impress a selection committee that has had little trust in the Trojans in the past. With a pair of ranked games left against teams that have already wiped the floor with USC this season, the Trojans can seek redemption not only for this year’s missteps but also past seasons.
USC is back in action Thursday night in Boulder against No. 18 Colorado, followed by a game Sunday afternoon in Salt Lake City against the Utes — two final road tests that ought to show whether this Trojan team is different from those that failed in previous seasons.
Without a doubt, it’s tournament time and it’s up to this Trojan team to buck the trend and make it to the big dance. This script is, as of yet, unwritten.

Coming off victories at home against Washington and Washington State, the USC men’s basketball team will look to extend its two-game winning streak against No. 18 Colorado to kick off its final road trip of the regular season. This will be the two teams’ second meeting of the year after Colorado’s 78-57 rout over the Trojans earlier this month.
Although USC has performed well at home with an impressive 11-2 record, road games have been a struggle: The Trojans are 5-4 away from Galen Center after two tight road battles against Arizona and Arizona State slipped away from them earlier this month. 
Saturday’s blowout win over the Cougars was a welcomed sight for the Trojans after grinding through three straight games decided by 6 points or less.
“It felt good to get this win,” freshman forward Isaiah Mobley said after the victory, per the Orange County Register. “Not necessarily take a break because they’re still a solid opponent, but get our minds right for this road trip we got to go on.”
With the next two games being their final road battles of the season, USC will indeed need to prepare to face Colorado. The Buffaloes sit at the top of the Pac-12 with Oregon while the Trojans sit one game behind.
USC would certainly benefit from another big performance from redshirt senior guard Daniel Utomi, who scored a season-high 23 points against the Cougars. Utomi has stepped up his performance in February, averaging 15 points per game this month, nearly double his season average of 7.9.
Slowing down Colorado guard and forward Tyler Bey will be crucial for a Trojan victory, as the junior had a tremendous 21-point, 15-rebound performance against Oregon State Saturday. Junior guard McKinley Wright IV is also a key player for the Buffaloes, averaging a team-high 13.6 points per game and coming off a double-double performance Saturday with 13 points and 10 rebounds.
However, USC is averaging the most rebounds per game as a team in the Pac-12. The Trojans will need to continue crashing the glass to prevent another great performance from Bey and Wright.
Defending the perimeter will also be essential for USC as Colorado has the second-highest 3-point field goal percentage in the conference. However, the Washington State game — in which USC forced its opponent to miss 21 consecutive threes during one stretch — proved just how dominant the Trojans’ defense can be.
“They’re long [on defense] and they did a good job,” Washington State head coach Kyle Smith said of the Trojans, according to the Associated Press. “It bothered us and it felt that way.”
Freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu is expected to play after missing the last two games with a concussion and getting him involved early will be crucial for USC. Okongwu struggled in his last game against Colorado, shooting 3-of-8 from the field. Senior guard Jonah Mathews also failed to find his rhythm against the Buffaloes as he shot 4-of-15, but he will look to continue his strong 3-point shooting after sinking four threes against Washington and five against Arizona State. 
With the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments approaching in less than a month, USC will need to strengthen its bid for March Madness. A victory over Colorado would not only tie the two teams in the conference standings but also be an impressive addition to USC’s resume for the upcoming national tournament.
The Trojans’ crucial tilt with the Buffaloes in Boulder, Colo. will begin at 6 p.m. Thursday.

The USC baseball team is gearing up for the Tony Gwynn Classic in San Diego, where the Trojans are scheduled to take on Seattle, Southern Illinois and San Diego State Friday through Sunday.
The Trojans put up a combined 35 runs on 41 hits in a season-opening series win over Western Michigan last weekend and received contributions from up and down the lineup. Head coach Jason Gill is hoping his team to keep the bats alive in San Diego.
“I said two weeks ago that I told the team we’re 14 deep offensively, and I think it’s up to about 16 right now where there’s 16 guys I could send up to the plate right now that have a ton of confidence,” Gill said after Friday’s opener. “And that number is continuing to grow. You know, we have 20 hitters.”
The Trojans will be greeted in San Diego by a Seattle team that struggled its way to a 13-39 record last season and dropped two of its first three games this year against Creighton. Still, the Trojans will be tested by senior infielder Austin Lively, who was placed on the watchlist for the Bobby Bragan Collegiate Slugger Award Tuesday, which is given to college baseball’s top hitter. Lively posted an impressive .298/.381/.426 slash line last season and should provide one of the Redhawks’ biggest threats to USC’s pitching staff. 
That staff received three solid outings from its starters last weekend. Those same starters, junior righty Kyle Hurt, junior lefty Isaac Esqueda and redshirt sophomore lefty Alex Cornwell, figure to start on the hill again this weekend, though Gill has not confirmed the rotation yet.
The Trojans will need to control the strike zone if they want to slow Lively or any of their opponents this weekend, and Gill said after the WMU series that will be one of the main focuses this week in practice. 
“We have to shore some things up in the bullpen, we’re walking too many people out of the bullpen,” Gill said after Trojan relievers allowed nine free passes in 13.1 innings in the series. “So I think we need to shore some of that up before next weekend.”
Saturday, the Trojans will face off against a Southern Illinois team which already brings a 3-2 record to San Diego. SIU’s young season has been highlighted at the plate by senior infielders Nick Neville and Ian Walters. Neville carries an absurd .440 batting average and 1.040 OPS into the weekend while Walters falls just behind him with a still-impressive .389 average and 1.020 OPS. No other Saluki hitter with significant at-bats is within 100 points of those two in batting average or 250 points in OPS, so if the Trojans can stop those two, expect them to handle SIU.
USC junior lefty John Beller said USC’s philosophy on the mound this season has been to pitch to contact and let the defense make the plays. Beller, who allowed just two hits and 1 run in five innings of work out of the bullpen Friday, and the Trojans will figure to use that same approach over the weekend. 
“We have a really good defense,” Beller said. “So kind of what we’ve been preaching this year is just put the ball over the plate and let our defense work.”
The Trojans will wrap up the tournament with a tough showdown against San Diego State. The Aztecs will likely present the biggest challenge to USC this weekend as they enter the Classic fresh off an impressive win against No. 24 Cal State Fullerton. 
SDSU brings three players with a significant number of at-bats, who have a batting average over .300 (including two in the .400 range) and an OPS over 1.000. This list doesn’t include senior outfielder Mike Jarvis, who went 2-for-4 with a double and a homer against Fullerton, so the Trojan pitching staff will have a lot on its plate Sunday.
Despite the 8-4 win, SDSU committed a whopping six errors against Fullerton. This is out of 11 total errors through the season of just four games compared to three for USC.  
If the Trojans can bring solid pitching and strong defense into the weekend and against SDSU, they should be able to steal at least a couple of games — if not all three — in San Diego. 
“We feel like we’re pretty sound defensively,” Gill said. “If [the pitchers] are throwing strikes and putting the ball in play, we feel like we catch it behind them.”
The first two games will start at 1 p.m.; the first pitch Sunday will be at 2 p.m.
