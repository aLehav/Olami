On Tuesday, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences hosted a “Feminist Conversation” in the Hall Building that covered gender and the paradox of transnational advocacy for sex workers and gay and lesbian people in India.
The event featured Chaitanya Lakkimsetti, an Andrew Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow with the gender studies program and the Center for Feminist Research at USC.

Lakkimsetti specializes in areas concerning sociology of gender, sexualities, law and society, global sociology and qualitative research methods. Her doctoral dissertation, which won the Law and Society Association’s best dissertation award in 2011, compared the political struggles surrounding decriminalization of homosexuality with the legal and political struggles over sex work in India. Lakkimsetti is currently working on a book manuscript titled Governing Sexualities: Governmentality, Biopower and Citizenship in Postcolonial India.
Contemporary India is at an intersection of the postcolonial state, social movements and transnational advocacy, Lakkimsetti said. Speaking on the basis of her ethnographic research, Lakkimsetti discussed the role of globalization in shaping local struggles in the comparative case of anti-sodomy law and decriminalization of sex work.
“She provided a different perspective on things that you hear of all the time in the news [regarding these issues],” said Allison Miller, a postdoctoral scholar in the history department. “The discussion really pulled together different points of view — it was truly eye-opening.”
One of Lakkimsetti’s main assertions during the discussion was that globalization of health and human rights interact unevenly with Indian struggles, due to established transnational norms. She said that though globalization of Western ideologies of sexuality are viewed by some in a positive light as it liberates traditional sexualities, this globalization can also be viewed in a negative light because it intrudes on indigenous culture in a way that is not as beneficial as one would think.
Lakkimsetti also said transnational advocacy has focused on prostitution as a gendered issue, and not as sexual labor. Similarly, she said homosexuality is viewed as a matter of sexual identity, and not a matter of gender identity.
“[Dr. Lakkimsetti’s] discussion about the transnational approach to sexuality of labor represented one node of study that we’re really interested in pursuing in gender studies,” USC English professor Alice Echols said.
Throughout her talk, Lakkimsetti discussed the past and present movements in India led by sex workers, gay men and lesbians, and the results of these movements, some of which were very effective and progressive.
In March 2006, about 5,000 sex workers stormed the Indian parliament building to protest a controversial amendment regarding prostitution and trafficking laws. In another significant development, the New Delhi High Court made a landmark judgment on the anti-sodomy law in July of 2009.
Lakkimsetti spent much of her speech reviewing recent movements, bills and mobilizations in India that indicate progress for sex workers and homosexuals in gaining more of the rights that they have fought for.
“When people go back and think about this discussion, my goal is not for them to think about India as being completely repressive and backwards,” Lakkimsetti said. “My goal is that this discussion helps people to look at India as a country that actually has a lot to offer the world in the future.”

Students from USC, UCLA and the California Institute of Technology attended Startup Equinox, an event organized by USC students, that allowed students to pitch ideas and form teams to compete in local startup and innovation competitions.
Students from a variety of disciplines pitched their ideas onstage for 90 seconds, hoping to attract other students with similar interests.
Spencer Moss, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, was one of the organizers of the event and also an entrepreneur who is passionate about the startup culture.
“This is my fourth Startup Equinox that I’ve done,” Moss said. “We wanted to create a place where students can come together and bounce their ideas back and forth, and hopefully build teams and ventures out of them.”
Startup Equinox is an event that brought together entrepreneurs and university students from the greater Los Angeles area. During the event, founders, entrepreneurs and students connected, shared their business ideas and offered expertise in areas such as marketing, design, finance and engineering.
“When we were first organizing, what we noticed was a big disconnect between the Marshall entrepreneurs, the idea guys, so to speak, and the engineering students, the creative people,” Moss said.
The event began with a conversation between Eytan Elbaz and Ankur Bulsara, the founders of Scopely, a mobile entertainment network. The discussion was moderated by Ashish Soni, the founding director of the Viterbi Students Institute for Innovation.
“The goal is to give students some real context as to how they can make their ideas come true,” Moss said. “They come from different stages; some people have ideas and others have fully funded startups and successful ventures.”
Many attendees were excited to have the opportunity to meet other entrepreneurial-minded students.
“There is a huge entrepreneurship community at USC but there hasn’t really been a way to meet each other until now,” said Asher Genoot, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I think this is a great event for entrepreneurs to come together and showcase what they’ve done and ask questions to learn what entrepreneurship is all about.”
Michael Boateng, a freshman majoring in cognitive science, pitched a business at the event. His startup idea, Madafo, is a fashion business that hopes to integrate individualism into fashion.
“When I was up there, I thought to myself: Believe in yourself. No matter what happens, as long as you believe, that’s all it matters,” Boateng said.
Samantha Katzman, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism, participated in the event in the hopes of building her portfolio.
“There are a lot of really creative people out there and I think it will be interesting to be involved in a startup and to be around some motivated people,” Katzman said.
Genoot said that Startup Equinox is not only for people to grow their entrepreneurial spirit, but also to meet other people who are interested and foster those relationships, even after graduation.
“What’s really amazing is that when we have a Startup Equinox, someone’s coming back and saying that they’ve met their business partner at Startup Equinox and now [they’re] in a later stage [of creating a business],” Moss said.

Undergraduate Student Government’s weekly senate meeting Tuesday night featured an extensive presentation from the Wellness Affairs Committee, an announcement of the 2013-2014 Elections Commission, senatorial announcements and a brief presentation from the Queer and Ally Student Assembly.
Wellness Affairs Director A.J. Pinto said his committee is reaching out to students who are California-certified emergency medical technicians. The committee wants to establish an on-campus organization that pays these students to provide emergency services to fellow USC students.
“There are student EMT services at other school’s campuses … We’re looking for a way to create and fund an organization for student EMTs,” Pinto said.
Pinto hopes the program would, among other responsibilities, establish a student-run ambulance service that could carry out emergency medical transports.
Given the frequency emergencies related to alcohol at USC this fall, Wellness Affairs is working to change a policy that can incriminate a student for underage drinking if they call for a fellow student to be transported.
“We’re talking about getting amnesty for students who call their friends in for transports, so they’re not held accountable for underage drinking themselves,” Pinto said.
Wellness Affairs is also still working to change USC’s smoking policy based on last year’s resolution to make campus smoke-free. Graduate Student Government representatives said they were concerned that international students would not support a smoke-free campus, a claim that Pinto says is unfounded.
“There is a higher proportion of international students that smoke compared to any other demographic, yet only 6.6 percent of them are smokers,” he said.
Another ongoing issue for Wellness Affairs is recreational space. Though the University Village development promises an increase in recreational space for students, Pinto said that recreational organizations are still underfunded.
“Space is a huge issue and money is a huge issue. While space has improved, funding hasn’t improved at all. We need to figure out how to get money for the rest of our activities,” Pinto said. “Right now, funding is an unnecessarily complicated system.”
After the Wellness Affairs’ presentation, Assistant Director of Elections and Recruitment Kelsey Hyatt announced the 16 new members of USG’s 2013-2014 Elections Commission.
“The elections commission is in charge of overseeing any violations of the elections code, and this is very important this year because of our new election code,” USG Vice President Ryan Park said.
The changes to USG’s election code have altered the timetable for students to campaign for positions in student government.
USG Senator Matthew Prusak announced a USG resolution to ban on-campus solicitation.
“Solicitors should not be on campus asking students for money or soliciting donations. If you see these individuals on campus, call DPS and they’ll take care of it,” Prusak said.
The resolution came as the result of an online survey that polled students’ opinions regarding on-campus solicitation.
Executive Director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly Rebecca Grumet also gave a short presentation in which she announced an upcoming dodgeball tournament sponsored by QuASA.
“It’s a great way to bridge queer life and athletics, and it’s something that’s never been done before,” Grumet said.

At 7 p.m. on Tuesday night in the Founders Room of the Galen Center, approximately 75 people from the University Park neighborhood gathered to talk about urban design guidelines for the community.
Preach · Pastor Kevin Blue of the Church of the Redeemer addresses the audience at a Town Hall meeting on Tuesday night at the Galen Center. – Tony Zhou | Daily Trojan
The crowd was composed of small business owners, USC faculty, community leaders and concerned residents. Despite their different backgrounds, all had something to say about USC’s multimillion-dollar plan to transform Jefferson Boulevard.
The public hearing was held by the City of Los Angeles Department of City Planning regarding the plan that aims to transform the area around USC into what the project’s website characterizes as “a vibrant, walkable mix of retail shops, restaurants, student housing and academic space that has long been needed.”
Community members spoke at a podium in front of two city planning representatives to voice their concerns.
Chief among their concerns was the allegation brought up by several community members that USC has reneged on its promise to extend the development of new bike lanes, street lights and trees to the area west of the campus from Vermont Avenue to Western Avenue.
This has, in turn, fed worries that USC is contributing to the disparity in quality between the university and the neighboring area, including those expressed by community leader and pastor Kevin Blue, who characterized the university as building a “buffer instead of a bridge.”
Blue, pastor of the local Church of the Redeemer, strode to the podium, his young son following him in a matching suit.
“It feels like a bait-and-switch,” he said, referring to the plan’s failure to include key improvements to the area that were allegedly promised to the community on May 10, 2012.
Blue reiterated his point: the community wanted the promised trees, lights and bike lanes.
“If you’re supportive of these measures, please stand,” Blue asked of the assembly.
The majority of the hearing’s attendees rose to their feet, smiling and murmuring among themselves.
“We have 256 signatures on an online petition,” Blue continued as the community stood behind him.
Citizen after citizen walked to the podium following Blue, each emphasizing USC’s need to develop the surrounding area.
“This is not a bridge,” 30-year resident of the neighborhood Thomas Florio said. “This is a wall.”
Florio pointed out that USC has long rejected calls to wall off the university campus since the 1980s, but that the new development project seemed to be a shift toward isolationism between the university and the community.
“Now, with this fenced-in, guarded community with a camera on every corner, I sometimes feel like a prisoner,” he said.
As residents such as Florio spoke, representatives from the city planning department lingered at the back of the conference room, many of them using their cell phones or chatting among themselves.
The effect that the community’s statements will have on the development agreement is unclear.
Senior City Planner Craig Weber said that planners will consider the remarks as they submit a recommendation on how bicycle traffic will be handled in the new plan.
But as far as altering the wording of the development agreement goes, Weber said that “ship already sailed.”
USC already has a contract with the city in which their obligation is to pay a set amount of specified funds before constructing their new buildings.
Community members, on the other hand, said that the funds were vaguely allocated and might never reach Western Avenue and Vermont Avenue.
Weber said that he did not hear the remarks from USC representatives that formed the basis of the supposed broken verbal agreement.
“All I know is that this is what our council adopted,” he said.
The planning commission is slated to adopt the plans in December, leaving the fate of the utilities still in question.

Thank you Steve Marks for your thoughtful and considerate comment! It is a shame that so many of our brethren react with arrongance and scorn to those among us who are struggling to make improvements in their community.
Wow, really surprised by the comments here so far.
USC is a private university, but the plan they are proposing presses into and through public property and spaces, so of course the people in those places it affects (surrounding neighborhood residents) ought to have a voice. I sort of can’t believe that isn’t obvious. How would you feel if a a local business near you had a plan approved that drastically altered the street that ran directly in front of your house? I bet you’d want to have some say in that. After all, it’s your neighborhood too.
Also, I think the main issue here was that USC had already said it intended to make these improvements and now, after it had “won over” neighborhood support, is seemingly backing out of those commitments. That doesn’t sound like whining to me, as much as it sounds like asking for an agreement to be honored. 
And finally, and many may not agree with me here — as a Christian, the idea of “neighbor” is an important one. The Good Samaritan is heralded by Jesus as he cared for his neighbor. You might even call it “a handout”. Jesus called it love and said how you treat your neighbor says something about your relationship with God. I say good on USC for making efforts to see and reach out to the surrounding neighborhood for decades now. I’d like USC to continue in this strong legacy by following through on this commitment.

My mother always taught be not to “bite the hand that feeds.”  Apparently that isn’t taught in the community surrounding USC.
Let’s pack up the campus and move to Malibu where we won’t be repeatedly extorted by ungrateful beneficiaries of USC’s generosity.
It would be a win for students, who would be able to leave their homes at night again, and (from the sound of their whining) a win for these community members, who will finally be rid of the neighbor who apparently inconveniences them so greatly.  Free these people from USC’s oppression!
Maybe the Pastor would like a new swimming pool and some tennis courts as well? Why not a new church with a lot of money in the til?
Everyone is looking for handouts nowadays.  I honestly like the idea of USC being a walled fortress.  It’s private property, so why not?  Keep the charming South Central community out.
It’s sad and indicative of the entitlement culture.  USC is not in the business of making every poor persons life better.  However you wouldn’t know that reading the comments of the folks who spoke in opposition of this development.  I was embarrassed for them after reading their nonsense.
I wonder what political office Pastor Blue is planning on running for? Is Bernard Parks leaving?
This is another attempt of stick it to USC for more money. Why would USC be responsible for renovating Jefferson Blvd to Western? That is a city responsibility. We all ready got stuck for $20million by the neighborhood that we love so much and do so much for.
This “Outrage” is more of the same:” You have something, I want it, now give it to me or I will make trouble.” This is not about building walls it is coercion, pure and simple. How lucky are we to live in such a great neighborhood with such greedy neighbors.

As an atheist, it’s encouraging to see the non-religious/non-affiliated percentage so high.
Why does it seem the most important demographics are race? It’s not exactly motivating for a black student so see that his race has a lower graduation rate than his white and Asian peers.

Just two years ago in Mexico, USC sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio was a big fish in a small pond, excelling at a sport that involved hitting a ball over a net when the rest of the country was — and still is — preoccupied with kicking a ball into a net. Now, Bricio has taken over the volleyball scene at USC and across the nation with a deadly serve and a quiet intensity that intimidates opponents while inspiring her teammates.
Bricio has been a force on the USC women’s volleyball team since arriving on campus. She took the conference by storm from the outset, winning the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honor an unprecedented five times throughout the course of the season and helped the team advance to the NCAA Tournament. Her rise to volleyball stardom, however, was not always a certainty, and for a long time seemed to be even unlikely.
A native of Guadalajara, Mexico, Bricio never envisioned herself playing volleyball after high school. At 16 years old, she was the youngest player to ever play for Mexico’s national team and displayed enough talent to play at the next level. Despite all of her accolades in high school, her future in volleyball seemed foggy at best.
“I only figured out I wanted to play in college two or maybe three years ago,” Bricio said. “My dad told me how cool it would be to play in the United States, and I thought ‘Yeah, it would be really cool,’ but I didn’t have any scholarships and I thought I wasn’t good enough to play there.”
Eventually, though, her father convinced her to pursue it, and soon enough Bricio was entertaining offers from several NCAA programs. The decision for Bricio came down a choice between currently top-ranked Texas and USC. The allure of Los Angeles and the Trojan tradition was enough for Bricio to choose playing for head coach Mick Haley and the Women of Troy.
Haley was a fan of Bricio from the start, and saw something in her that he rarely finds in recruits — let alone international recruits.
“As an athlete, she’s tall, she’s strong, she’s quick and she’s explosive,” Haley said. “She’s got the classic arm swing, and had all of that before she came here.”
Despite Bricio’s offensive prowess, Haley knew that there would be things to work on in her game during her collegiate career, but he did not expect her to be so willing to adapt or adjust so quickly to life as an NCAA volleyball player.
“She wasn’t spongy and wasn’t really tuned-in defensively,” Haley said of Bricio as a high school player. “But her greatest asset is she just loves to play the game. You put her in a competitive situation, and she kicks it up four times. That’s what we picked up on.”
As a freshman, Bricio immediately became a star. She started all 36 matches for the Women of Troy and played in all but one of the team’s 122 sets. Along with her five selections as Pac-12 Freshman of the Week, Bricio was the first-ever freshman to win the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week and was named the American Volleyball Coaches’ Association National Player of the Week on Oct. 9 of last year.
By the end of the season, Bricio had proven herself on the court to be a legitimate star on an already star-studded volleyball team. She led the team in kills, service aces and points, and finished the season ranked fourth in the Pac-12 in kills per set with 4.06. These accolades were good enough to earn her a spot on the Pac-12 All-Conference team, the Pac-12 All-Freshman team and even an honorable mention on the AVCA All-America team. She was named Freshman of the Year by Volleyball Magazine and, to top it off, was named the Freshman of the Year for the Pac-12.
After such an impressive freshman season, many wondered whether Bricio would suffer from a sophomore slump. So far this season, this has not happened, as she has managed to find ways to improve her game even further, especially on the defensive end.
“Samantha couldn’t wait to get back here in August to join the team,” Haley said. “Which is surprising because she was a little homesick last year. She is now one of the team leaders whether she knows it or not. She’s improving her game in the backcourt, she’s already improved her passing. She was awesome in blocking, another area she’s trying to improve.”
Bricio has seen her number of kills decline this season, but not for lack of effort or skill. By design, the offensive strategy has shifted to a more spread-out attack style, in part to save Bricio for the postseason and in part to utilize USC’s newest offensive weapon — freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu.
As an outstanding freshman outside hitter, Nwanebu is in a way following in Bricio’s footsteps from last season. Though there might be competition between the two, Nwanebu is happy to have Bricio standing alongside her on the court.
“Sam is one of my best friends,” Nwanebu said. “I remember last year when I was in high school and she was a freshman, I just wanted to be her, I thought she was so amazing. When I got here I was intimidated at first, but she welcomed the freshmen with open arms.”
More than her statistics or athletic ability, Bricio’s most important skill is arguably her attitude and dedication for the team. Senior libero Natalie Hagglund has been impressed by Bricio’s demeanor from the beginning.
“What she brings is such a quiet intensity,” Hagglund said. “You don’t really see her out there cheering or jumping around, but you will see her get a straight-down kill and not see her make any facial expression. Last year, she was an offensive asset for us. This year, she does everything.”
With only four weeks remaining in the regular season, Bricio looks to lead USC to its first national championship in 10 years. With her improvement in all areas of her game and a talented roster of teammates around her, this just might be the year the Women of Troy break through — and Bricio will add yet another accomplishment to her resume that, only two years ago, seemed to be virtually impossible.

With the end of football season just around the corner, the Trojan faithful will now be turning their attention to the USC men’s basketball team.
Athletic Director Pat Haden made a huge splash in April in hiring head coach Andy Enfield to replace the fired Kevin O’Neill and, hopefully, change the direction of the flailing basketball program.
The move received mixed reviews, with some looking at the hire as a glorified publicity stunt for a program that has struggled to fill the Galen Center seats and others believing Enfield’s high-octane offense will translate well to the Pac-12.
One thing is absolutely for certain, though — this USC basketball season will be one to watch.
Senior center Omar Oraby shined at times last season, mostly coming off the bench in O’Neill’s slowed-down system, but seemed to struggle in critical moments. Still, his 7-foot-2 frame cannot be ignored in the bruising Pac-12, so fans should expect his minutes to increase, and for the Rice transfer to play a dominant role on this year’s squad.
The Cairo, Egypt native averaged a respectable 6.3 points and 3.9 rebounds in just over 14 minutes per game. His real presence, however, was felt on the defensive end, where he averaged 1.5 blocks per contest.
Though Oraby should enter the season as the Trojans’ starting center, questions remain about how he will fare in Enfield’s new offensive system.
“I’ve been working in the offseason very hard on my conditioning and my quickness,” Oraby said. “My main focus was to get my conditioning better and to start and stay in the game as long as I can.”
Oraby seems to be settled in as the team’s most dangerous low-post presence, but it is not clear who Enfield and his staff will select to join him in the frontcourt as the starter at power forward.
Sophomore forward Strahinja  Gavrilovic seems to be the early favorite, as the Serbia native made some impressive strides this summer.
Last season, Gavrilovic appeared in just six games, but has shown that he has a very potent inside-out game. His three-point range is especially intriguing, as it could make him a great tandem play with Oraby, who does most of his work deep in the post on the low block.
“I like Coach Enfield’s system, especially because I’m prepared to run,” Gavrilovic said. “I like how he plays me in the four-spot. He wants me to spread the floor [and] to shoot threes. I have more opportunities here in this system.”
In addition to Gavrilovic, a pair of freshman forwards in Roschon Prince and Nikola Jovanovic will also be given an opportunity early in the season to compete for minutes and potentially grab a starting spot.
Prince comes to USC after an extremely heralded prep career that saw him earn the Gatorade High School Player of the Year award for the state of California as a senior. During his time at perennial powerhouse Long Beach Polytechnic High School, Prince established himself as an extremely aggressive player on both ends of the floor, and is expected to make an impact on the program for years to come.
Whereas Prince excels at the dirty work inside the paint, Jovanovic prefers to utilize his quickness and technique to cause mismatches for opposing teams. At 6-foot-10, he will be taller than most of the power forwards who try to guard him, and he is already known as one of the better shooters on the team.
“I like to score and rebound. Somehow I am always in the right place at the right time,” Jovanovic said. “I will shoot the three-point shot whenever I have a chance.”
For now, Enfield might be coy about who he wants in his starting lineup, but one thing is for certain — he’s promising fun and excitement, and he wants the fans to come out and show support, regardless of who starts at forward or any other position.
“I think our whole team is exciting,” Enfield said. “It’s going to be a lot of fun, so the student and fan experience should be awesome.”
The Trojans’ season opener is  on Friday against Utah State in Logan, Utah. The team opens at home Nov. 12 against Cal State Northridge at the Galen Center.

This isn’t a column about Jonathan Martin, the former Stanford offensive lineman whose NFL future remains in question after he left the Miami Dolphins last week after reportedly being bullied by fellow lineman Richie Incognito. This isn’t a column about bullying — I’ll leave that to the psychologists and experts to deal with. Instead, the Martin incident raises a new point: What should relationships be like within a locker room?
Father figure · USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron has instilled a newfound sense of family in his players, and the team has adopted the motto of “One team, one heartbeat,” for the remainder of the season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The darkest point of the Lane Kiffin era at USC wasn’t the debacle with Washington State or at Arizona State. It wasn’t missing out on a big-time recruit. For me, the cratering of his tenure was what happened after USC’s loss to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl last December. The details are hazy, but multiple reports tell of USC players fighting among themselves in the locker room following the 21-7 loss.
That was an awful way to end last season, but the Trojans appear to have moved on from the ugly event. USC’s next opponent, California, should be preparing for the Trojans this week. The Golden Bears, however, have become wrapped up in a situation of their own.
Details are still emerging, but on Friday, Fabiano Hale, a freshman running back for Cal, was hospitalized after a locker room altercation with a teammate, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. UC Berkeley police confirmed that two players were involved in an altercation in a statement released Monday.
Fighting seems natural in the game of football. There have been rules put into place to curb violence, but jarring hits still turn the needle. Just ask South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, whose vicious hit on Michigan’s Vincent Smith in the Outback Bowl last year was SportsCenter’s “Top Play” for 45 straight days.
The brutal but non-accidental tackles can be tolerated. I’m fine with small sideline scuffles between opposing teams. For players, football is more of a lifestyle than a game, and emotions are bound to run amuck in any given game.
The buck stops there, though. It’s hard to expect more than 100 players to become best friends by virtue of being on the same team together. Many do, and many do not. I understand that tensions might flare between football teammates, whether it’s over poor play, competing for playing time or anything in between. Violence and bullying, however, are never the answers.
The idea of making life a little bit more difficult for rookies has been around in football almost as long as the sport’s existence. Freshman players at USC carry water during spring practices, for example, and rookies in the NFL pay for veterans’ dinners among other activities. It’s one thing to show a young teammate the ropes; it’s another to try to tie them down with that rope.
The idea of superiority is not confined to sports. Being a good teammate, however, is about more than superiority — it’s about respect. Every member of a team has to have respect for one another, and I would never try to physically harm or personally attack someone I respect. I’m not going out on a limb by saying that Martin’s being bullied; Hale’s fight with a teammate and USC’s locker room brawl were all situations in which respect was lost and tempers boiled over.
Part of this, of course, ties back to the search for USC’s next football coach. In every post-game conference, interim head coach Ed Orgeron has focused more on his pride in his players than the intricacies of the team’s game plan.
I don’t toss around the term lightly, but Coach O really does seem to love his players, and the feeling seems to be mutual. Kiffin praised his players plenty throughout his tenure, but his coyness made it hard to discern whether the praise was sincere. Orgeron acts as if he would step into a lion’s den, fight, and likely win, for his players.
According to reports, Martin never approached Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin about the issue. You can’t blame Philbin directly, but a coach should be among the first people a player having issues with a teammate would go to.
A coach should be a leader on the field and mentor off it. The USC coaching search will span from Seattle (Steve Sarkisian) to Nashville (James Franklin), but after the Hale and Martin incidents, perhaps Haden should take into account the ability to make the right calls off the field as well as on Saturdays.

After grinding out one of its most impressive victories of the season against Oregon State, USC has some of its most important pieces of the puzzle come together again.
All smiles · Redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen burst onto the scene against Oregon State with three rushing touchdowns. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee appeared closer to full strength on the practice field, and sophomore tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick and freshman safety Su’a Cravens were also back on the field. Cope-Fitzpatrick is listed as probable to play on Saturday after missing Friday’s game.
Things are definitely headed in the right direction for a team that, after starting 0-2 in conference play, remains a contender in the Pac-12 South. With a game against last-place California on the horizon, players know the perils of taking their opponent too lightly.
“I don’t think anybody is overlooking them,” Lee said of the Golden Bears. “As far as mindset goes, we are all positive, and we know that we’ve got to go handle our business and play smart football.”
Burgers, Anyone?
Interim head coach Ed Orgeron once again surprised his team this week, this time opting to serve In-N-Out burgers on Monday, much to the players’ delight.
“People enjoy that, and Coach O makes that happen, and we feel like as players in order to repay him, we got to give it all back,” Lee said.
The team appears to be responding well to Orgeron’s coaching techniques, as the Trojans are 3-1 since he took over for former coach Lane Kiffin following their loss to Arizona State.
USC’s positive attitude has been ramped up ever since Orgeron instilled a new sense of freshness into the team with his high energy level, and he doesn’t expect the Trojans to let up against Cal this Saturday.
“I would be concerned with a potential letdown if I didn’t trust this team as much as I do,” Orgeron said. “I’m confident that we are focused.”
Cal Prep Work
The biggest challenge for the USC defense, according to Orgeron, will be the Golden Bears’ spread offense. He also put an emphasis on stopping Cal’s many no-huddle looks.
USC offensive players acknowledge that Cal’s gameplan could be difficult to keep pace with.
“Cal has a very explosive offense and they move the ball with passing and play action very well,” Lee said.
After USC hired defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, who coached at Cal from 2010 t0 2012, Orgeron acknowledged that the Bears’ defense has appeared to have some “growing pains,” as they moved from the 3-4 scheme back to the 4-3.
The Golden Bears have allowed slightly more than 42 points per game through nine games, which ranks 122nd in the Football Bowl Subdivision. The Cal defense is also giving up nearly 530 total yards per game and letting up just under 341 yards per game through the air.
They Call Him Buck 
With freshman running back Justin Davis out for the season and redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden not 100 percent while nursing a sore hamstring, redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen stepped up for the Trojans against Orgeron State, rushing for 133 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries.
“I trust my speed, trust my technique and good things happen,” Allen said. “I thank the coaching staff for believing me and trusting me. The offensive linemen and my fullback did a great job, and we are out here continuing to get better.”
Injury Report 
Orgeron reported Tuesday that Madden and senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin will not play this Saturday against the Golden Bears.
According to Orgeron, both players could be out for  an “extensive period of time,” though he would not comment on their status for games beyond this weekend.
Madden will see doctors on Wednesday to determine when he can expect to return to action.
Redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown and redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer have also been ruled out for the Cal game. Redshirt freshman offensive lineman Jordan Simmons and senior offensive tackle Kevin Graf are listed as questionable.

Sophomore Annie Park and senior Sophia Popov willed the USC women’s golf team to a one-stroke victory on Tuesday at the Pac-12 Preview, helping extend the squad’s school-record winning streak to seven events.
Perfection · The USC women’s golf team extended its school-record seven-match winning streak on Tuesday with a one-stroke victory at the Nanea Golf Club in Kailua Kona, Hawaii for the Pac-12 Preview. – Courtesy of USC Sports Information
The pair each shot final round 2-under 71, six strokes lower than their next best teammate but just good enough to squeak by No. 5 UCLA. No. 9 Washington, No. 13 Arizona State and Oregon rounded out the top five at the Nanea Golf Club in Kailuna Kona, Hawaii. Individually, Park’s 7-under performance earned her sole possession of second place, while Popov’s 6-under placed her in a three-way tie for third. The Bruins’ Bronte Law took the individual title at 8-under.
Washington jumped out to a four-stroke lead during Monday’s opening two rounds, forcing the Women of Troy to play catch-up. Park, Popov and junior Doris Chen all played strongly on Monday, with Park and Chen shooting identical 5-under scores. This was not enough to put the squad in front, however, as Washington’s strong effort, along with Law’s remarkable second round 8-under, kept USC in third place.
Though Chen fell off on Tuesday with a 4-over 77, Park and Popov kept their team in the hunt as neither the Bruins nor the Huskies could secure the victory. Law shot a 3-over 76 for UCLA, her worst score of the tournament, and Washington’s low scorer SooBin Kim shot a disastrous 5-over 78. USC head coach Andrea Gaston was excited about the nail-biting victory.
“I am so proud of our team,” Gaston told USCTrojans.com. “As their coach, I appreciate how hard they work, and how they just keep fighting on!”
The victory completed an undefeated fall season for the Women of Troy, who won four straight to open a season for the first time in school history. More impressively, this win marked the team’s first using the lineup that won the national championship last season and will likely play this spring.
“To win four events this year with four different lineups is a testament to the depth and talent of our team,” Gaston said. “This is truly a special group of young ladies.”
The USC men’s golf team was also in action on Tuesday, finishing in second place at the Gifford Collegiate in Newport Beach, Calif. Freshman Rico Hoey and junior Anthony Paolucci finished first and second overall, with Hoey overtaking his teammate in the individual race after a final round 4-under 68.
The pair shot identical 6-under scores through the first two rounds of action, before Paolucci’s final round 69 cost him a victory. The No. 23 Trojans fell to No. 1 Alabama by only three strokes in team play, a positive result in a field that also included No. 4 Washington and No. 7 UCLA.
Though Hoey and Paolucci were the best players on the course, USC could not match the Crimson Tide’s consistency. Junior Paul Smith finished at 3-over, but seniors Jeffrey Kang and Ramsey Sahyoun struggled mightily. All of Alabama’s players finished at or below par. Still, it was an impressive effort from the Trojans, who made up six strokes on the Tide in the final round of action.
“It was a great way to finish the fall segment,” head coach Chris Zambri told USCTrojans.com. “We have some guys on the team playing some great golf. My hope is that their play will lift the others on the team to get better so that we can start getting some wins.”
Both the men’s and women’s squads will now take the winter off in preparation for the spring season. The Women of Troy will begin their defense of a national championship on Feb. 9 at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes, Calif., while the men’s side picks things up Jan. 27 at the Arizona Intercollegiate in Tucson.

For the majority of the trends I’ve explored, I have tried to maintain an open mind. Embarking on any activity with a positive outlook is an essential step in getting positive results. I will admit, however, that I decided to explore Bitstrips out of sheer annoyance.
Bitstrips is both a mobile app and a desktop program that connects to your Facebook so that you can design your own comic book avatar. This cartoon version of yourself can then engage in cartoon misadventures that you create using the Bitstrips app. The concept, on its own, sounds intriguing. The execution, on the other hand, leaves little to be desired.
All of the examples of Bitstrips cartoons that have popped up in my newsfeed are boring. As a member of the generation that grew up with some of the greatest cartoons in the history of cable television (i.e., the animated gems of Nickelodeon) my expectations were maybe a bit high. Bitstrips are like asking a child to paint a Picasso.
The first time I saw a Bitstrips cartoon, which was a month or two ago, I had no idea what it was. About two weeks ago, someone finally had the gall to comment on this particular Facebook cartoonist’s all-too-frequent posts and ask what the hell these posts were about. Once I finally had a name to attach to the silly craze, the cartoons seemed to pop up more and more.
There has been a sudden surge in Bitstrips user activity since the mobile app was launched at the end of September. As a matter of fact, Bitstrips has actually been around for a few years, even though they’ve only been on Facebook since December, 2012. Bitstrips’ chief executive and creative director, Jacob Blackstrock, told the Baltimore Sun, “Basically, it’s an app that turns you and your friends into a cast of cartoon characters. Then you can take those characters and put them into crazy scenes.”
Two problems exist with Blackstrock’s statement. The first is slightly semantic and maybe just a personal opinion, but whenever a product has to be labeled as “crazy,” my consumerist alarms start blaring. Why do the product and its company have to resort to an adjective such as “crazy” to make viewers want the product? “Crazy” as a label, when used in conjunction with a consumer product, is meant to carry a connotation of carefree fun.
Except, in my opinion, an adjective such as ”crazy” is an advertising crutch. You don’t see Don Draper slapping the word “crazy” on any of his Heinz ketchup prints. Making a lame-a– comic book strip and posting it on your timeline is not “crazy” — it is annoying. Go out and do something rather than post about it. Or, if you are really so inclined to share with your entire Facebook network what you’re doing at this very moment, then be annoying like everyone else and just make a status while doing it.
Along those same lines, I have a problem with apps that attempt to force you to swindle other friends into using that same app. If you want to indulge an urge to become a cartoon then hey, good for you, pal. But don’t try to drag me down with you. The Bitstrips compulsion to wrangle other Facebook users into using the app reminds me of the endless requests to play Farmville. Fortunately, those eventually died out, and hopefully Bitstrips will suffer the same fate.
Besides the weak marketing structure, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes Bitstrips so irritating. The comic book style itself is not particularly pleasing on an aesthetic level. When I first attempted to download the app to my phone, it crashed several times before finally pulling itself together. By that point, however, I had switched over in agitation to my laptop to create my crazy, cool comic book.
For people who don’t have a natural talent to draw or sketch or do anything artistic, maybe Bitstrips is an appealing outlet. Not everyone can just whip out a comic strip of what they did over the weekend because comics are actually not easy to create. An eye-catching drawing style is necessary, along with enough wit to keep the reader’s attention. Bitstrips has the same appeal that Draw Something did, except at least Draw Something occurred among friends and not splattered across everyone’s newsfeeds.
In my opinion, Bitstrips fails in the vital aspects of a good comic strip. The drawing style is too generic. It’s already been done. Bright colors and big eyes? Yawn. At least give users an option of what sort of style they want to use. I will admit that creating my own avatar was a little fun. Who can resist exploring what they would look like as a cartoon? The fun, for me, however, stopped there.
After my avatar’s creation, the app went downhill. The “misadventures” seem to all be predetermined. It could have been my lack of motivation, but I could not find a way to make my own comic book situations. I instead had to rely on the moods and misadventures provided by the app. Granted, there are supposedly more than 1,000 situations, with new ones added daily.
The underlying problem I have, if I had to summarize it, is that the Bitstrips app takes away a lot of creative agency from its users. Maybe I am just deluded and would like to consider myself more artistic than I am, thus I feel entitled to be frustrated with the lack of options when using Bitstrips.
On the other hand, the app also seems to be another way for Facebook users to attempt to flex their wit and utterly fail.

Ha! So after looking up a few references, maybe you actually used the phrase correctly! In that case I have to say its a pretty dumb phrase though (since saying “little to be desired” and “much to be desired” is apparently saying the same thing) and should probably be avoided.
http://www.writersevents.com/Words_Starting_with_L/leave_it_at_that_left_right_and_centre/leave_little_to_be_desired_definition.html
Anyway, yeah, bitstrips are lame.
You misused “little to be desired” … It’s actually good to have “little to be desired,” it means you are not lacking much. For you, bitstrips are lacking a lot, therefore they have “much to be desired.”
I completely agree with you both. I have been using the main site for awhile,and occasionally post my strips on my timeline, but the majority go into an album where my friends can view them, or not, as they choose. Even before this recent influx, I was smart enough to know that not everyone was going to be as entertained by my cartoon antics as I was. My biggest fear is that, once the main site is back online, all of the newbies will invade THERE as well, and another outpouring of badly done and decidedly UNfunny  comics will ensue. People will be so burned out that those of us who put time,effort, and hopefully, a little TALENT into our strips will be lost in the  crowd. It’s a shame.
i agree with Edgar! I’ve been on the real site for almost 4 years now and it’s much better than that extremely annoying app.
The real Bitstrips website (which is unfortunately down for maintenance) offers more creativity. You are able to create multi-panel comics, there are 100’s of props to use and you can create your own characters/co-stars. Facebook isn’t required. On the actual site there’s no limit to what you can do. I agree the Facebook one is stupid and offers little creativity, but you should check out the main site. (After the developers fix it). You also don’t have to use templates on the regular site.

“This remarkable phenomenon, of whatever value it may turn out in its application to the arts, will at least be accepted as a new proof of the value of the inductive methods of modern science,” William Henry Fox Talbot wrote in 1839.
Progressive photography · Linnaeus Tripe’s 1858 photograph of “The Eliot Marbles” is a piece that relies heavily on the use of negative space. In 1857, Tripe became the official photographer to the Madras government. His trip to Madras resulted in a photo collection entitled Burma Views. – Photo courtesy of LACMA
 
Here, Talbot — a pioneer of photography and inventor of the calotype — speaks to the transcendent nature of the art form. Photography is very technical in nature, yet still fits perfectly well into the humanities in the art that it produces.
This interconnectedness of art and science is a leading theme in “See the Light — Photography, Perception, Cognition: The Marjorie and Leonard Vernon Collection,” a new exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
The exhibition pulled 220 photographs from the roughly 3,600 found in the Vernon collection, which LACMA acquired in full in 2008. The pair had collected photography since 1975.
The exhibition was broken up into four parts: descriptive naturalism (Talbot’s quote was pulled from the accompanying text here), subjective naturalism, experimental modernism and romantic modernism, with a camera obscura room toward the end and a video project from David Hockney, “Seven Yorkshire Landscape Videos.”
Descriptive naturalism essentially explores the notion that photography can capture images perfectly without human error. It is the perfect blend of art and science.
In the first section of the exhibition, portraiture, landscape and architecture are explored as they would be seen in real life. Some pieces were slightly more artistic, such as Thomas Struth’s “Palmerston Place, Edinburgh,” a piece from the show that stood out for its crisp lines and high contrast.
Most pieces, however, looked at their subjects naturalistically, as they would have been seen at the time. This included work from famed landscape photographer Carleton E. Watkins, best known for his conservation photographs taken of Yosemite Valley.
The subsequent section on subjective naturalism, on the other hand, lent itself more to ambiguous forms and abstraction. Big names here included Edward Weston, Alfred Stieglitz and Ansel Adams.
A perfect example is Josef Auden’s “Sunday Afternoon on Kolin Island,” a photograph of maids working at what would appear to be some kind of lunch. The maids are captured from behind, whereas much of the first portion of the show featured traditional portraiture taken of subjects from the front. The maids are slightly blurred, but still recognizable. They are somewhat  distorted but the piece as a whole is not entirely abstract.
Many of the other photos here included industrial subjects, which was fitting, as industrial and technological development contributed to the photographic progress.
The photos only continued to become more abstract as the show progressed, particularly in the experimental modernism segment, which allowed for and encouraged the avant-garde.
André Kertész’s “Paris 1929,” with its playfulness in capturing shadows, interesting angles and abstract composition, stood out as an experimental modernist work. The subject — the Eiffel Tower — is recognizable as a famed landmark, but is also presented in a nontraditional way.
Though there had been sprinklings of color throughout the show, in this portion viewers really got a taste of the abstract and the colorful with Barbara Kasten’s “Construct NYC,” a piece that the Vernons admired for its relation to European abstractionists, though their collection as a whole has more of a humanist core. The piece is a standout in its relatively larger size, interesting shapes and bright shades of pink and purple.
The portion on romantic modernism — which is inspired by nature, isolation and personal connectedness with the world — was the true highlight of the show.
Brett Weston’s “Reeds and Ponds” experimented with high contrast to the point where one might not recognize his work as a photograph. It was fascinating trying to figure out how he captured the image so exactly.
Speaking to connectedness to the world, or lack thereof, George Tice “Petit’s Mobil Station, Cherry Hill, New Jersey” was less abstract in form, but powerful in its exploration of the human experience. Reminiscent of David Hopper’s “Nighthawks,” Petit’s photograph tells a story of loneliness, one that sucks the viewer in with its pathos.
The end of the exhibition offered a camera obscura room where viewers could see images of LACMA’s surroundings (cars, apartment buildings, etc.) flipped upside down.
David Hockney’s “Seven Yorkshire Landscape Videos” concluded the exhibition, looking at nature on multiple screens using multiple cameras. It offered viewers a sense of resolution to photography’s story (up until now) as it looked at the extreme progress that has been made. From Talbot to Hockney, if you will.
It is important to note that a timeline with major events from the history of photography existed throughout the exhibition: Eadweard Muybridge motion studies (1878), Thomas Edison and W.K.L. Dickson develop 35 mm film (1889), Alan Turing develops Turing machine (1935), introduction of Adobe Photoshop and Internet (1990), are just a few of many examples.
This history expressed through the timeline and various genres within photography contributed to the viewer’s understanding of photography’s technical capabilities and aesthetic range. Together, it told a story of science and art, areas of study that perhaps are commonly thought of as disparate, but in the case of “See the Light,” are highly interconnected.
 
“See the Light” will be on display at LACMA through March 23, 2014.

Some people just know how to keep you laughing.
Sharp wits · Berman, a lecturer at USC, had a successful theater career in Chicago and Woodstock, Ill. before beginning his career in writing. – Photo courtesy of Shelley Berman
Shelley Berman, Lecturer Emeritus of USC’s Masters of Professional Writing Program, has been dazzling audiences with his charming wit and wry humor since he first began performing in Chicago nightclubs in the 1950s. And, over the course of the next 60 years, that signature comedic style has found its home in literature, television and even films such as You Don’t Mess with the Zohan and The Holiday.
Today, however, the Grammy Award-winning and Emmy award-nominated comedian releases his first volume of poetry, To Laughter with Questions: Poetry by Shelley Berman. The compilation represents more than 20 years of Berman’s work and features a variety of styles from puns on the sonnet form, to limericks to elegies.
“I’m a long time writing poetry, but I never dreamed of writing a book, not until somebody looked at some stuff that I had and said, ‘My God! Why don’t you write a book?’ But I’ve enjoyed it,” Berman said in a phone interview, before joking: “It’s another way to brag.”
Berman’s journey into comedy began after he finished his term serving in the U.S. Navy in World War II. Because of the opportunities for education provided by the G.I. Bill, Berman then decided to start a career in acting at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.
“I didn’t think of myself as becoming an acting star, but I did good work,” Berman said. “And little me, I was trying to be something that I wasn’t. I was thinking maybe I could be a comedian. I thought I was being funny. Actually, people did start enjoying me, and I started enjoying it, but I didn’t think of making a career in comedy. That would have been ridiculous. I wanted to [act.]”
At the Goodman, Berman met his wife of 66 years, Sarah, who was also studying acting. In Berman’s latest work, his wife features prominently in several poems such as, “Walks with Sarah” and “Sarah Still.”
“I swear my favorite poem [in To Laughter with Questions] is a simple one,” Berman said. “And it’s called ‘Sarah Still.’ She’s so much a part of my life that it’s hard to even think that we’re separated in any way.”
After his successful career in acting where he landed fiendish roles in Othello and other classic plays in Chicago and Woodstock, Ill., Berman transitioned into comedy. He began to perform in nightclubs, such as the famous Mister Kelly’s, where he earned a reputation for his standup and improvisation. There, Berman began to hone his skills in a variety of comedic forms alongside other famous talents.
“There was a cute little girl who did a lot of singing, and she sang quite well,” Berman said, reflecting on his time at Mister Kelly’s. “[She] sang mostly about [her] race. I liked what she did. It was very good. And she was actually a young little folk singer … And today she’s Maya Angelou.”
Berman’s own stylings allowed him to venture into the theater, television and cinematic worlds. After recordings of his standup comedy earned the attention of large audiences, Berman took on roles in shows such as Fiddler on the Roof and La Cage aux Folles and, eventually, the hit TV show Curb Your Enthusiasm. Off the screen and stage, Berman also published several humorous books such as Cleans and Dirtys and Up in the Air with Shelley Berman.
Berman’s interest in writing poetry, however, did not begin until his time at USC. Impressed with his background in humor writing, poet James Ragan, then the head of the MPW program, invited Berman to teach and take his course in poetry.
“One day, [Ragan] gave me an assignment,” Berman said. “The whole class had an assignment, and he told me I’d outdone all the rest of the class. And I took that with me everywhere I went. And somebody [would ask] me ‘What do you do?’ And I’d say ‘Well, I’m a poet.’ I knew better, but today my poems are being published and we’ll be seeing them in the book.”
But when he wasn’t exercising his creativity, Berman reveled in the vibrant culture at USC. He enjoyed going to football games accompanied by his wife, as well as hosting Saturday brunches with creative writing master’s students at his home in Bell Canyon. Berman’s background in comedy helped him recognize effective ways of helping his students develop their own talents, even in famous alumnus Juno and Up in the Air director Jason Reitman.
“My chest got very big,” Berman said. “I couldn’t just sit there. I was the boss, and I was good. And I was able to say, ‘That’s a mistake! How do you like that?’ And I was able to help. I knew what I was doing.”
Now, Berman’s own creations are coming full circle. To Laughter with Questions features comedic writing as well as brooding observations on his own life experiences. All of these poems are subdivided into categories such as, “Poetic Forms,” “Elegies” and “Not Much to Brag About.”
But readers shouldn’t think that Berman’s extensive background in comedy in any way limits his poetic abilities. Poems such as, “To Laughter with Questions” and “To My Son, Joshua, On Father’s Day, 1970” are reflective and honest, even as they are showcased next to more humorous pieces such as, “First Day of the Poet” and “Iambic Pentameter.” In particular, the title of the poetry collection indicates the simultaneously comical and poignant tones that run through Shelley’s poetry.
“There was a time in my life, that I had a beautiful, beautiful son, the most extraordinary human being I’ve ever encountered,” Berman said. “He was funny. He had a good sense of humor. He would make me laugh. He made me feel so good to be with him. And soon … before his 13th birthday, he would die. And that tragedy was the worst. I wrote a little poem about him about how there was laughter with him. And so that little line, ‘to laughter with questions,’ became the title of the book.”
As the title suggests, one of Berman’s most remarkable traits is his ability to balance life’s darker moments with the same charm that earned him a reputation in a variety of art forms. Readers will notice that tidbits of humor slip in throughout the entire compilation, serving as Berman’s own signature literary stamp. But that should come as no surprise. Berman calls himself, after all, just “a funny guy.”
“[How] can I stop being humorous?” Berman said. “I did a couple of funny poems [and] elegies [of] friends of mine, or people I admired … I have to have a lot of nerve to step into somebody’s death and make it into my work. But I have always done this with love in my heart.”
 
To Laughter with Questions will be available at the end of November from Bear Manor Media.

With college sports becoming a booming business in the United States, it’s sometimes easy to forget that the players who are often viewed as celebrities or “big men on campus” are, for the most part, no different from any other college student.
Though most student-athletes are recognized primarily for their athletic endeavors, all of them have schoolwork, social lives and families to focus on, along with the complex maturation process that every college student must go through.
This transitional phase can be tough, as nearly all students will attest. But the challenge becomes much more difficult when the commute from hometown to campus is not merely a quick drive up the 110 freeway or the cheapest flight Southwest Airlines can offer. For international students coming from overseas, the adjustment to life as a college student — and student-athlete — in the United States can be a daunting one.

At USC, there are currently more than 55 international student-athletes on varsity rosters, according to the Athletic Department’s website. Many of them arrived on campus under similar circumstances — with excitement for a new challenge, but unsure of how to adapt.
“The first [semester] was really rough,” said Ivan Kustic, a redshirt junior from Croatia who plays utility on the men’s water polo team. “I wasn’t very good at English. I would say the language barrier was the hardest thing at the beginning, but everybody helped me, so [the transition] was pretty smooth.”
Kustic, like many international student-athletes, was drawn to USC’s athletic tradition and location in sunny and eclectic Los Angeles, but didn’t know how to best acclimate to his new surroundings. Fortunately for him, the structured routine student-athletes are subject to helped him grow accustomed to life as a college student.
“Freshman year was just amazing,” Kustic said. “I would do tutoring five hours a week and they were all helping me. It was really, really helpful. It was kind of hard because I was out all the time, either in class, tutoring or practice, but it helped me a lot.”
Even more helpful for Kustic than the academic resources were his teammates, who gave him an already-established initial group of friends.
“It wasn’t too hard, to be honest,” Kustic said. “All the guys were really nice to me and ready to help all the time, so it was a really easy adjustment.”
Creating a strong team bond early in the school year is crucial for making international student-athletes feel at home, said Magdi El Shahawy, director of the USC Student-Athlete Academic Services. Unity is the easiest way for international student-athletes to quickly feel relaxed in their new environment.
“We encourage the coaching staffs to foster some team-building opportunities so that their domestic student-athletes will intermingle with international student-athletes more,” El Shahawy said.
Though players can adjust to life in America on their own, the SAAS takes measures to ensure that international student-athletes receive sufficient help upon arriving in the United States.
“The one thing you will find more when dealing with an international student-athlete is a cultural adjustment,” El Shahawy said. “We spend time addressing that with our international student-athlete population during their orientation session, talking about the different resources that are available to them on campus, like the Office of International Students.”
In addition to helping student-athletes become comfortable on campus once they arrive at USC, El Shahawy is also looking into how and why these foreign students chose USC, of all places in the world, to go to college.
“I looked up water polo in the United States, and USC was the top one, so that was immediately my first choice,” said Kostas Genidounias, a junior from Athens, Greece, who plays driver for the men’s water polo team, adding that the prevalence of foreign players in the program played little to no role in his decision-making process.
For others, the motivation to go out and explore the world comes from the desire to continue both athletic and academic pursuits. Other parts of the world do not offer college sports to students, meaning that once high school ends, many have to choose between attending college or becoming a professional athlete. The United States and the National Collegiate Athletic Association give international students the chance to do both, a fact that students and administrators are well aware of.
“I think they come to an American institution to get an education and further develop their skills in their sport,” El Shahawy said. “Our coaches go out and recruit and make USC sound very appealing. They get a chance to get a free education, where sports don’t provide that for them in their own country.”
For Strahinja Gavrilovic, a sophomore from Serbia who plays forward on the men’s basketball team, USC gave him the chance to follow his dream of pursuing a career in professional basketball while still allowing him to prepare for life after his basketball career comes to an end.
“I like the system here. In my country, you have to choose either to play professionally or go to school,” Gavrilovic said. “Here, I have the opportunity to do both — study and play basketball.”
Like Kustic, Gavrilovic initially had difficulties adjusting to life in the United States, but is now comfortable in Los Angeles and feels at home at USC. His travel experience has paid dividends for his teammate, freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic, who is also from Serbia. Jovanovic credits Gavrilovic in helping ease the sometimes awkward growing pains that come with leaving home for the first time.
“He’s done a really great job,” Jovanovic said of Gavrilovic. “This is his second year, and he’s kind of shown me around and made my life much easier and helped me adapt.”
Which is often really what any new college student is looking for — friends that will make the four (or five) years in between youth and adulthood as memorable as possible. When their years at USC end, many international student-athletes enjoy their time at USC so much that they want to stay in the United States after graduation rather than return to their home country.
“Over the course of their experiences at USC, a lot of them fall in love with Los Angeles,” El Shahawy said. “There is a desire to stay here a little while longer, and that is not atypical from any other student who’s not from overseas. They come here, and they don’t want to go back because they enjoy their time in California.”

Earlier this semester, USC was named one of Campus Pride’s Top 25 LGBT-Friendly Colleges and Universities, an accolade the LGBT Resource Center received for the first time in 2006, just one year after becoming an official university department under Student Affairs.
Campus Pride is an organization dedicated to advocating for a safe environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students in college. Their rankings are meant to provide a national standard for LGBT policies and advocate for the needs of LGBT students.
Under the direction of former LGBT Resource Center Director Vincent Vigil, who left the center on Oct. 31, the Resource Center has worked closely with the Queer and Ally Student Assembly since the center’s establishment in 2005.
QuASA Executive Director Rebecca Grumet said in the past, QuASA and the Resource Center have collaborated to address LBGT issues on campus, but Vigil’s departure might impact QuASA’s future programming.
“It’s the dilemma that Glenn [Young, assistant director of QuASA,] and I are facing this year, how much of QuASA should be education and activism, and how much should be cultural and social,” Grumet said. “What I can say is the Resource Center picked up a lot of that educational programming, which we may absorb now.”
The Resource Center offers a variety of programs to engage the LGBT and ally communities, including a peer-mentoring program, discussion groups, a special interest residential community, an alumni network and scholarships.
QuASA Networking Chair Emily Huang said that the assortment of programs for LBGT students and allies is what sets the university apart.
“USC does make an effort to recognize diversity without isolating people,” Huang said. “I really, really like some of the programs that are being developed, especially when they highlight intersectionality. Especially in the resource center and cultural assemblies, they work to program things that will overlap and show how one identity can affect another.”
The center also holds events such as “Greek Chat” and “Athlete Chat,” which facilitate a more open discussion about sexuality in these sectors of campus, and oversees organizations such as the Jewish Alliance for GLBT’s and Straights, and Queer People of Color.
Kyron Richard, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said these groups allow LGBT students to explore other aspects of their identities and how they relate to gender and sexuality.
“People involved in those communities understand how difficult it can be to identify as a minority in this culture,” Richard said. “There’s a lot of intersectionality. For example, I’m part of LGBT, but I’m also an African-American student.”
In addition to the diverse interests and backgrounds of students in the LGBT community, the experiences of individuals within the community are just as varied.
“Coming out as trans[gender] is so different from coming out as [lesbian, gay or bisexual]. Any of those identities come with their own experiences,” Huang said.
Grumet said despite the challenges that the LGBT community at USC still face, the Resource Center and QuASA have come a long way since their establishments.
“We are becoming a more open assembly that can hopefully fit a wider spectrum of students’ needs and wants,” Grumet said. “I think our program is becoming more diverse in that way. We’re providing a bigger space than for just LGBT.”

Of the last five Undergraduate Student Government presidents, three have been members of the Sigma Chi fraternity. In addition, four of the past five winning president and vice presidential tickets have included one member from Sigma Chi.
The fraternity is one of 23 active houses in USC’s Interfraternity Council. And though other IFC fraternities have not fared poorly in past elections, Sigma Chi easily dominates the lineup.
“I think there’s a very big emphasis [in Sigma Chi] on finding potential members who want to be involved in campus and want to do other things besides just the fraternity,” said Mikey Geragos, who served as USG president from 2012-13 and was a member of Sigma Chi. “There’s an emphasis on that that is placed during rush and during the pledging process and it’s really valued.”

Despite Geragos’ explanation for Sigma Chi’s winning streak, the issue raises an important question as to how diverse USG truly is.
Diversity within the organization can vary depending on which aspect of USG one focuses on. After all, USG is divided into many parts, including an Executive Board, Executive Cabinet, Program Board and Senate, and many of the branches have diversity built into their structures. For example, the Senate, by definition, is required to comprise three commuter senators, three Greek senators and three residential senators.
The organization has recently made attempts to find out more about which areas of USG could benefit from more diversity, and is currently conducting a poll of its members, looking at race, sexual orientation, gender and Greek affiliation. In preliminary results shared with the Daily Trojan on Monday, 59 members had responded. USG Senior Director of Communications Olivia Diamond estimates the total number of USG members at 115.
Of the respondents, 37 percent said they were affiliated with Greek life, a higher percentage than the general student body’s involvement in Greek life. Fraternities and sororities have a combined membership of approximately 4,000 students, according to the Interfraternity Council website. Taken as a percentage, that amounts to 22 percent of USC’s 18,316 undergraduate student body population.
In terms of racial diversity, however, USG’s percentages are relatively representative of the undergraduate student body. In the fall of 2012, the university reported that 39 percent of students identified as white, 23 percent as Asian, 5 percent as black and 14 percent as Hispanic.
The at-large ratios are fairly consistent with the USG survey, in which 39 percent of USG respondents identified as white/Caucasian, 25 percent as Asian/Pacific-American, 8 percent as black and 12 percent as Hispanic/Latino.
Still, USG members said that they have recently prioritized increasing the diversity within the organization.
“I think that [USG] is diverse already, because diversity is more than surface-level diversity,” said Lamar Gary, director of Diversity Affairs and a former Black Student Assembly director. “We all come from different places, we all have different experiences, and I think that that’s valuable. But I think that we can always improve upon that.”
Monica Parra, executive director of Program Board, credited Gary with the recent push for greater diversity.
“I think a lot of the reason [diversity] is such a big issue this year is because of Lamar Gary,” Parra said. “I feel like he really comes from a different perspective in student government and just working really closely with student government and other kinds of underrepresented organizations to help to carry out their causes and what they want to see change on campus.”
Gary said he spent a lot of time at the beginning of the year, even before classes started, recruiting students from different groups on campus by attending new student symposiums hosted by El Centro Chicano, Black Cultural Student Affairs and Asian Pacific American Student Services.
“I have the second largest committee and I’m pretty sure that’s because I went and spoke,” Gary said. “I spoke on behalf of all of USG, but I told them that I was in Diversity Affairs, so that may have helped in getting people for Diversity Affairs.”
Andrew Cho and Taylor Rottjakob, co-directors of elections and recruitment, also have been working this year to attract new students, just through different means. The two said that in addition to an annual open house, they have used social media and reached out to leaders of other groups to encourage their members apply for positions.
“One of the things we’re actually working on is reaching out to as many people as possible,” Cho said. “Part of our goal is to reach out to all the assemblies, to reach out to all the committees and to reach out to as many of the constituency groups as possible.”
A common sentiment among USG officers, however, was that though they could encourage involvement among different groups of the undergraduate student body, they ultimately don’t have control over who decides to apply or run for a position.
“We’re going to try to get the information out to as many people as possible, but when it comes down to who applies, that’s out of our control,” Cho said. “We can’t fill [the application] out for specific people.”
Still, USG is working to attract members in different ways. In a letter to the editor of the Daily Trojan that was published on Oct. 10, USG president Christian Kurth said that one of the two reasons the organization pays some of its members is to ensure diversity.
Kurth later said he is not sure the two have a direct correlation, but he believes that some people in USG would not be able to be a part of the organization if no salaries or stipends were offered. As a result, he believes that paying members creates a wider pool of applicants who are able to take on a position.
“I think there’s a lot of people in this organization who, had we not paid them, [would not be able to] do this because a lot of them are putting themselves through college and they’ve got to pay the bills and what have you,” Kurth said.
Each branch of the system, however, is unique. As director of Program Board, Parra said she notices some diversity issues exclusive to Program Board.
“I would love to see more gender diversity,” Parra said. “I think that’s really lacking and I’m not sure why.”
Parra’s beliefs were reflected in the preliminary results of the USG survey. Sixty-six percent of the respondents were female, while only 34 percent were male. Parra floated the idea of creating a men’s student assembly, similar to the Women’s Student Assembly, which currently works to address gender issues and empower female students,
“We don’t have a men’s student assembly so to even kind of balance out the women’s student assembly, the men’s student assembly, I think, would be really cool,” Parra said.
If created, a men’s student assembly would join eight existing Program Board assemblies and a new assembly that’s slated to be integrated next semester. Each USG assembly represents different populations within the USC student body, ranging from a Political Student Assembly to a Queer and Ally Student Assembly. Program Board will launch a Green Student Assembly next year that will officially become a full-time assembly in the 2014-2015 school year, Parra said.
Though gender balance within Program Board might be skewed toward women, the opposite is true for some elected USG positions. In the last five years, only five out of 30 candidates for president and vice-president were female. Of those races, only two women were elected to serve as vice-president.
“I think it’s so important to keep getting the message out about stepping up to the table, because an underrepresented population is a vulnerable one,” said Kaya Masler, co-director of the Women’s Student Assembly. “Your motivations for being in politics and being in office are personal, and you come to that [position] with your experiences dictating what you want to make out of it. If women’s experiences are not being put into that process, they’re not going to be taken into account in the drafting of legislation.”
The Women’s Student Assembly is working to address this issue. The group is partnering with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics to host “Lean In,” an event on Nov. 22 that will encourage more women to run for elected positions in student government.
“I think part of the event is just showing women that there’s a community of support around them and if they are interested in running, there are other women who also feel that it’s important,” Masler said.
Ultimately, Gary underscored the importance of making the case for why students who wouldn’t otherwise join the organization should.
“It’s just a matter of breaking down those barriers and telling people why they need to be in USG,” Gary said. “That’s what my recruitment included, just being very candid and letting them know: ‘Hey, this is why you need to be in USG. Don’t just complain about things, be a part of the conversation by being in the room.’”

Elizabeth Eddy, a senior majoring in business administration, belongs to a family that has attended USC for four generations. Eddy is the 18th member of her family to attend the university. And now that her brother and cousin also currently attend USC, the Eddy family has had 20 members of their family attend the university.
“The Trojan Family is so cool because we are one of the few colleges in the world that has such a tight-knit family feel that even once you leave, you love it so much that you want to give back,” Eddy said. “So it’s like a pay-it-forward type of system and it’s really cool because I have seen that through my family over the past 100 years.”
When filling out the application to USC, applicants are asked to specify whether or not they have had any relatives attend the university — and if so, who they were and the year they graduated. For some, this area of the application serves as a boost of confidence. For others, it’s a cause for unease.

Over the past nine years, the percentage of freshmen legacies, or “SCions,” as the university calls them, has ranged from 18 to 24 percent. And with percentages hovering near 25 percent, one question often asked by both current and prospective students is to what extent an applicant’s status as a legacy will affect his or her chances for admission.
Among some students, there is a belief that applying to USC without a legacy can make the admissions process more difficult.
“I didn’t really know much about USC but at my school it’s seen as a really hard place to get into,” said Stephanie Brill, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “So when I was applying, I thought that because nobody in my family had gone, there was no way I would get in.”
And, to a certain extent, having a legacy certainly is factored into admission decisions, though it serves as only one piece of an applicant’s profile, according to Timothy Brunold, USC’s dean of admissions.
“It’s considered,” Brunold said. “It would be what we might call a ‘plus factor.’”
But Brunold emphasized that admissions decisions are not formulaic. Instead, applications to the university are evaluated holistically.
“It can help a student in the process. It’s likely never going to turn a student who might otherwise be ill-fitting for USC into an admitted student, but it can certainly help us to distinguish when we are looking at a wide range of candidates who might look pretty similar,” Brunold said. “We are going to tend to prefer those students who already have other folks in their family who have experienced the university.”
This is a difficult line to walk, however, because many non-legacy students feel a strong connection to the university’s tradition, despite not having family that has previously attended.
“Even though I just joined the Trojan Family a year ago because I never had any family connection, I got integrated into the family really quickly,” said Connor Pace, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “I couldn’t be happier to be a part of it and wouldn’t want to be anyplace else.”
When looking at applications, the admissions office values more than just a connection to tradition. In recent years, admission to USC has become increasingly competitive, Brunold said, largely because of changes in academic rigor. Contrary to the belief of many, this has not affected the number of legacies admitted. In fact, as USC’s acceptance rate has decreased in recent years, the acceptance for legacies has increased.
“The SCions that apply to USC are pretty quality students,” Brunold said. “So not only are they members of the [Trojan] Family, but they are students that are going to be good for this university in terms of our academic profile. If you look at the students who apply to USC by GPA, by SAT, by some of these numeric indicators each year, SCions generally have a little bit higher numbers in that regard.”
Brunold said the admissions office is unable to release GPA or SAT scores for legacy students because the office does not publically release such statistics for any subdivision of applicants.
Though statistics for legacy admission are only given for the freshman class, many legacies come to USC as transfer students. The university offers a transfer planning program that’s aimed at offering support from the Admissions Office for prospective legacy students looking to transfer. This program was created about 15 years after concerns arose that legacies were being admitted at a lower rate.
At the time, Brunold said acceptance to the university was becoming increasingly competitive.
The program mostly works with members of the Trojan Family who were not offered admission immediately out of high school by providing advice on how to plan out how they might be better prepared for admission as a transfer student.
Paige Poulsen is one beneficiary of the program. She is a junior majoring in communication and a USC legacy who transferred during her sophomore year.
“It was helpful because they told us the classes we needed to take if we wanted to transfer,” Poulsen said. “It was also helpful once I decided I wanted to apply to transfer. I had a [contact] that I could message about the application and ask questions about classes.”
The program was able to help Poulsen fulfill her dream of attending USC and following in her family’s footsteps.
“I grew up a fan and I feel like it’s just in my blood to love USC,” Poulsen said. “I felt like I have always loved the school but then actually experiencing it as a student made me love it even more.”
Still, Brunold warned that the program doesn’t mean admission is a certainty.
“It’s not a guarantee of admission and, unfortunately, over the years, there have been students who have gone through this process with us who we still have not been able to admit,” Brunold said. “It’s simply our way of reaching out to Family members and saying, ‘We really want to acknowledge how much you want to be at USC and we want to continue to work with you to give you the best advice that we can.’”
Some students reported mixed reactions from their peers after hearing that they are legacies.
Jack Medall, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, explained how he has learned to brush off negative reactions from students when they find out he is a legacy.
“I didn’t take it as anything, though,” Medall said. “People sometimes say, ‘You only got in because you’re a legacy,’ and I say that’s the point of being a legacy — that my family proved that they could be successful coming from this school, so they want me to come here. Some people are just a little bit bitter about it.”
Aaron Rifkind, a sophomore majoring in international relations, has not experienced a negative response to being a legacy.
“I don’t think my parents having gone here influences anyone else’s opinion of why I go here,” Rifkind said.
Some fear USC, as an institution that admits many legacies, might run the risk of creating a closed society. But many also feel that USC is welcoming to anyone of merit.
“I think we are elite. I don’t think we are elitist — I think there is a difference,” said Patrick Auerbach, associate senior vice president for alumni relations. “So we are elite but we are welcoming to anybody who is of great character, of great caliber, who is very aspiring and very ambitious.”
Jerry Papazian, a former trustee, also said he doesn’t perceive USC as exclusive.
“I never view USC as being a country club type thing at all,” Papazian said. “What’s been unique about USC from day one is that it has always been a place where anyone can come in and if they did well in school, they would credit back what they learned to the teachers they had back at the university and become very loyal alumni as a result.”
At the end of the day, though students might be able to specify their family’s connections to USC on their applications, a legacy classification is not a guarantee of admission.
“I think USC does a really great job of sticking to a lot of the great traditions while at the same time adapting to a very changing world,” Auerbach said. “We have to reflect that in everything we do from how we communicate with alumni to how we are recruiting the best students [and] the best faculty. There are going to be trade-offs in some areas. You know not every child of every alumnus is going to get admitted to USC.”
Brunold even believes that some students hold an inflated perception of the effects one’s legacy status might carry in the admissions process.
“What we do with this group and what we do with any group of applicants is that we are simply seeking the best students and the people who might present the best fit for the university,” Brunold said. “[Legacy] is one small element. I can easily say that if students are really worried about this then they are really missing the bigger picture about how the admissions process works.”

At a university so evenly balanced between male and female students, it might seem easy to assume that the same is true for other groups on campus. Among faculty, however, gender is not always as equally represented.
The discrepancies between men and women in the science, technology and engineering fields have been widely acknowledged on a national level. According to the most recent data from the National Science Foundation, in 2006, women constituted 28 percent of tenure-track faculty members in science and engineering and 19.4 percent of full-time faculty members in science and engineering nationwide.
Along with several other organizations at USC, the Women in Science and Engineering program hopes to foster greater gender equality in full-time and tenure-track faculty positions. WiSE specifically encourages greater representation of female faculty in the science and engineering fields.

The program focuses on faculty in Viterbi School of Engineering and the science and mathematics departments of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
When WiSE was founded on a $20 million anonymous donation in 2000, the university had only 15 female tenure or tenure-track faculty in the STEM fields. Now, the university boasts 49.
WiSE Program Director Leana Golubchik attributed this change to the program’s efforts to make greater strides to attract women into these departments at USC.
“We always advocate open searches, and finding the people that the departments would like,” Golubchik said. “But if it happens that a woman rises to the top of the search, we work with the various dean’s offices to help attract her here to USC. Some of the faculty members we have brought here have been absolutely phenomenal.”
The organization also offers grants called WiSE Fellowships to accomodate Pregnancy, Birth of a Child or Adoption to help female faculty members accommodate becoming new mothers. The grants apply not only to full-time faculty, but also to Ph.D. and post-doctoral students, and allow them to balance their careers with their families.
Sarah Fried-Gintis, WiSE’s program manager, said the grants allow new mothers to keep their careers on track after the birth of a child.
“They are really able to assist new parents and new mothers either before the birth, when they can’t be present in the lab, and after the birth when they have an infant and they have responsibilities to take care of the child,” Fried-Gintis said. “We often work in collaboration with the graduate schools parental leave program so that they get the assistance they need.”
WiSE also offers child care subsidies of $1,400 to help female Ph.D. students, post-doctoral students and faculty members manage the challenges of furthering their careers and taking care of their families.
Additionally, the program works to create a more welcoming community for women in these fields. Golubchik said she has seen continual growth in the turnout for WiSE’s distinguished speaker series and other events. She sees this as a sign of the community of women becoming more tightly knit.
“I think the space has given us the opportunity to create this community that we are trying to create, the community of mentorship, where faculty mentor other faculty and students mentor each other, Ph.D. students mentoring undergraduates or post-docs mentoring Ph.D. students,” Golubchik said. “We’d like to see people interacting in this setting and I think having this space has made a huge difference.”

When Stephen Los Baños remembers his USC Welcome Week, he remembers being alone. And it set the tone for his first semester at USC.
“The famed Trojan spirit was all around me, but I felt extremely out of place,” said Los Baños, a senior majoring in narrative studies and communication. “Everything seemed to be catered to the incoming freshman class. They were celebrating the Class of 2015, but I was coming in as part of the Class of 2014. I was like, ‘I don’t belong here.’”

Los Baños, 29, is one of 1,487 students who transferred to USC in 2011. Looking back, he would not trade his experience at USC for anything. But it was not an easy road for him to get where he is today. Los Baños worked full time for 10 years out of high school before getting laid off when the economy slumped. He decided to attend West Los Angeles College and graduated two years later as his class valedictorian.
Following the urgings of his professors and mentors, he set his sights on continuing his education. USC was his first choice and Los Baños felt elated when he was accepted. He even created a Facebook page for other incoming transfer students to connect before school started. His first semester at USC, however, was an uphill battle.
“I had to fight some demons,” Los Baños said. “I was very lonely and I got depressed. My age played a big part as well because I was just swimming in a sea of very young people. But, eventually, I just kind of realized that I’m here for me. I taught myself that you define what it means to be a Trojan on your own. We build this strong network of Trojans but it’s not like you just jump in and you’re there. You have to ask yourself what you can bring to the table. When I shifted my focus, that’s when I got empowered to do well. And from there, I charged straight through.”
Los Baños’ story is not unique. Though transfer students make up significant amount of the undergraduate population, many transfer students feel like an underrepresented minority, especially during their first semesters at USC.
 
Trojan family
Alex Rose, a senior majoring in communication, transferred to USC from Marymount Community College in 2011. Rose said it took time to feel at home at USC.
“You’re essentially dropped in a social environment where everyone has formed their cliques from freshman year because they met in the dorms and they were all bonding over something at a similar time,” Rose said. “USC didn’t really do much to help sort of mediate what transfers are feeling and make them feel like they are not alone. It’s like it’s assumed that transfers already know what college life is about, but the truth is that USC is different from many other schools.”
Coming from a small high school and college, the size and scale of USC was a new experience for Rose. In order to start to feel more comfortable, he went out of his way to join activities and organizations to find his own niche on campus.
“I knew that if I stayed quiet and sort of just went along my way going to classes and doing homework that I would not meet people. I needed to get involved with things,” Rose said. “That’s something transfer students need to know. You do have to make the effort to put yourself out there or else you will get alienated from social life.”
One of the organizations he felt most at home with was El Rodeo, the student yearbook. Director of Student Publications Mona Cravens, who oversees the operations of El Rodeo and the Daily Trojan, got to know Rose. And when Theta Chi contacted her asking for names of students who might be interested in helping establish the fraternity, she passed his along.
“At the time, Theta Chi was being reintroduced on campus and they were looking for founding fathers to restart the chapter. She told the recruiter that I might be a good candidate for starting a fraternity,” Rose said. “I did join Theta Chi as a founding father and things just fell into place. That was sort of my ‘in’ for making connections.”
Looking back at his experience, Rose said USC could do more for transfer students.
“I just wish USC did a better job of raising awareness on campus that there are tons of transfer students that enter USC per semester,” Rose said. “I think if that was something that people felt they could be more open about, they would feel that they weren’t alone and that would contribute to them feeling like they’re not the minority here. They’re not.”
One thing Rose said might help is creating more orientations and programs for transfer students. He was unable to attend a transfer orientation because he could not make any of the four scheduled dates, one of which is catered specifically toward international students.
“They definitely have way more dates for freshmen to do orientation and that’s sad because it almost feels like they don’t really value the experiences of transfers,” Rose said.
Despite obstacles that Rose had to face, he said that his experiences at USC have given him unparalleled, rewarding opportunities.
“USC is one of the best things that has ever happened to me,” Rose said. “The hard work that it’s taken me to get acclimated to USC life has paid off. I am able to refine my career goals and have a better vision of what I want to do afterward because of the direction that USC gives students the freedom to take.”
 
Forging connections
The university has taken steps to make the transition smoother for transfer students, such as the Transfer and Veteran Student Programs, founded by the Office of Campus Activities in the Division of Student Affairs in the fall of 2011. Run by Assistant Director Syreeta Greene, the goal of the program is to identify campus resources and serve as an advocate for transfer students matriculating into USC.
“There really wasn’t much by way of an overall program before this,” Greene said. “We did have something known as the scholarship program that focused on three community colleges that are part of USC’s family of schools … [but] that was a grant-funded program and that grant funding ended a few years ago. Beyond that USC didn’t really have anything in place, so departments filled in the gap in terms of reaching out and supporting students in their particular areas.”
Greene runs the center with the help of one student worker and the student transfer ambassadors. Her goal is to make her department a one-stop shop for transfer students.
“Transfer students are very diverse, there’s a little bit of everyone from your traditionally aged college student, who’s 18, 19 years old, to your non-traditional student, who’s maybe 40 and has a family and also commutes to USC,” Greene said.  “My focus is on that first semester for first-year students at USC. So far, what we can tell is once a transfer student feels integrated in the community they’re good — they have their network then, whether it’s academic, career wise, or personal.”
In addition to its office located in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, the department has a website which has information on financial aid, scholarships, academic resources and social events. Greene also emails a biweekly newsletter out to students to keep them informed on what is going on around campus.
“Part of the issue for transfer students is just identifying those opportunities and that information. If they don’t live on campus, there isn’t an RA who’s posting that information in a resident hall,” Greene said. “I have a number of different colleagues and liaisons across the campus that I work with to help them better understand the transfer experience, while also being able to [use them to] connect a student directly to a key person in a particular department.”
Though Greene said the program is in line with peer institutions in terms of providing an orientation, reaching out to students and letting them know what resources are available, she hopes to tailor the program to fit students’ specific needs at USC.
“As we continue to evolve, we’re just really honing in on what we can do to serve transfer students and aid in their transition here at USC,” Greene said. “That’s unfolding as we go along, as we are getting more students to even know that this program exists. We want to really hear them out so we can transition something that is unique to the university and really aids in retention and graduation of our transfer students.”
 
Spring forward
Spring admits make up one of the groups of transfer students with needs different from the larger community. Though transferring in the fall can be hard for students, transferring in the spring, in many ways, can be even more difficult. Christian Sibrian, a spring admit majoring in business administration, transferred to USC after spending two and a half years at University of California, Riverside. Though USC was her dream school, it wasn’t easy for her to come here.
Because Sibrian, now a junior, was unaware that she could apply for scholarships before she was accepted, she missed out on various merit and financial need-based grants when she came to USC. During orientation, she also said she wasn’t given the clearance to take the classes that she needed to take right away in order to graduate on time. Despite these obstacles, Sibrian said that when things were difficult, she constantly reminded herself that she was where she had always wanted to be.
“Ever since I was little, I thought, ‘I could go there, I could do it.’ The Shrine Auditorium is where I had my eighth grade graduation. I remember walking out of those doors looking across at USC thinking, ‘I’m not there yet, but I will be eventually,’” Sibrian said. “Then I came to orientation and heard about the five traits of being a Trojan: faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious. In my first semester, I was tested in all those things and I was like, ‘I just have to make it through.’”
Sibrian said she felt the impact of a USC course schedule as soon as she started classes.
“I could see the difference in the way the classes are structured. The teachers are more one-on-one,” Sibrian said. “When it comes to the recruiting process to get internships, at UCR I felt like I had to work 10 times harder to get the attention of a recruiter, versus here the recruiter comes to us. There’s this certain reputation and prestige that comes with USC and it’s true that the Trojan network exists.”
Today, she identifies with both schools, explaining that each experience has added to her personal and professional growth.
“UCR was very important for me finding what I want to do and it gave me that conviction to go after what I wanted and USC is me pursuing it,” Sibrian said. “Even though I never felt that spirit at UCR, I’ve always been a Trojan since day one. That’s something I wrote in my personal statement. I’ve been a Trojan forever. I went to UCR, I found myself and I came over here.”
For Sibrian, one of the most challenging parts of coming to USC was during the interim period when she was admitted to USC but was not yet enrolled. She pointed out that programs such as the Trojan Transfer Ambassadors, run by student volunteers at the Transfer and Veteran Student Programs and geared to help transfer students at USC, focus solely on students who are just coming in, not those who are admitted but have not yet started at USC.
“I would like the school to reach out more to students that have been admitted and are in the period where they are getting ready to come to USC,” Sibrian said. “I know there’s alumni SCendoffs, but as a spring admit, sometimes it feels awkward because you’re like, ‘I’m not here yet, but can I come to this event?’ I think that’s something that could be worked on — the school saying you’re a Trojan even though you’ll be joining us in January … It does feel a little bit awkward because you don’t feel like an official member yet.”
 
Fighting on
Student-created resources are also available for fall and spring transfer students. Los Baños’ Facebook group, for example, gave transfer students a place to talk about the transfer process, find roommates and discuss housing options.
“It caught like rapid fire. Suddenly this community of transfer kids from all over the place found my page and we started talking,” Los Baños said. “Like 99 percent of the friends I have now are from that original transfer group. We stuck together. They formed their own groups. They became roommates, best friends, study buddies, romantic partners … So much came out of that original group.”
Over the next two years, Los Baños has made successive groups to give students a place to discuss everything from the admissions processes, to articulation agreements, to financial aid information to housing tips. Now there are six groups to represent individual communities for fall admits and spring admits each semester.
“I realized that being underrepresented kind of sucks. If I can be that one voice to lift someone’s spirit and give someone hope about being a transfer student and being successful at it, then why not?” Los Baños said.
Los Baños also got involved with transfer organizations on campus. JaBari Brown, an academic adviser at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, approached Los Baños and a fellow transfer student to see if they could collectively revive the student Trojan Transfer Organization at USC in 2011. The ideas proposed for TTO became the Transfer Student Ambassadors outreach program, which could focus more on individual experiences of transfer students.
“Syreeta Greene is amazing. I stayed with her and I was part of every single pilot program they did,” Los Baños said. “I’m a part of literally every transfer thing that happened in that office. I was at every single event, the planning, the execution. It means a lot to me.”
He embraces the label of being a transfer student because he said it’s part of his identity.
“It’s important to know I’m a transfer student here, to declare it, because I feel like as a transfer student I did have to face some things that traditional incoming freshmen didn’t have to face,” Los Baños said.
Both in his own personal experience and in those of his friends, Los Baños said transfer students bring their own culture to USC.
“I feel like because we’re coming from so many different places beyond the context of high school that we’ve already been exposed to different kinds of issues at that post-high school level, whether that be geographic differences, diversity differences or anything like that. A lot of us are transfer students for a myriad of reasons: We have children, we joined the workforce, we went to the military. … All of that comes together united as transfer students,” Los Baños said. “We feed that body of diversity and collectively we create a community here, which is not very recognized — I mean, it’s getting there, but it takes a lot of work.”
Los Baños, who is preparing to graduate this spring, said that if someone told him when he first started that he would be where he is today, he wouldn’t believe it.
“When I look back at the experience, it’s like I wouldn’t have changed it at all because I learned so much. I grew so much,” Los Baños said. “This university has given me all the tools I need to move forward. It’s been a very bumpy ride but a very fulfilling one.”

Sahar Khorramnezhad is always dressed to a T. With dark hair, a strut that turns heads and a smile that brings light to any room, most know Khorramnezhad as a student highly involved in a variety of activities on the University Park Campus, ranging from her pre-law fraternity to Undergraduate Student Government.
But she hasn’t always radiated confidence. Growing up as a young girl of Middle Eastern origin, she recalls the endless taunting of her peers for one reason: her hijab.
“I would get so many stares and snickers,” Khorramnezhad said. “I could feel the way people looked at me to the point that I became such an insecure person with it on.”

A hijab is a headdress worn by Muslim women. Khorramnezhad said she started wearing hers at the age of nine, and said she faced negative reactions and misunderstanding from her peers.
Khorramnezhad is hardly the only Middle Eastern student who has experienced adversity of this type. Many Middle Eastern students at USC, who comprise a variety of nationalities, cultures and religions, feel the impact of perceptions that their Middle Eastern peers and the general student body have.
Though definitions vary, the Middle East is often defined as the group of countries stretching from North Africa to Iran and from Turkey to Yemen. The area is rich in diversity, and includes many groups categorized by nationality, religion and ethnicity.
Because of differences among groups in the Middle East, Khorramnezhad said there is no one organization on campus that caters to students from the region.
“Unlike the [Black Student Assembly] or [Latino Student Assembly] where there are many different assemblies under them,” Khorramnezhad said, “there’s nothing like that for Middle Easterners.”
Additionally, many students said though the regional term is used as a broad descriptor, they identify more with a more specified group.
Ifrah Sheikh, a senior majoring in fine art, said the diversity of the region comes from more than just a regional identity.
“I know a lot of people who identify with that region of the world but do so in different ways,” Sheikh said. “Which country you’re from and which you specifically identify with plays a big role. The customs and the dialect in which they speak also brings diversity to it.”
For Engie Salama, a senior majoring in global health, religion is a unifying factor for many Middle Eastern students. Salama started her college career living on the Muslim floor of Parkside Apartments. She also joined the Muslim Student Union, which seeks to strengthen the community as well as educate non-Muslims through various programming. She is now the president of the MSU, leading 11 board members and more than 100 student members.
“In terms of unity of the Middle Eastern community, I don’t think there are any issues but there isn’t a cohesive, uniting force either. It’s not really divided or united,” Salama said. “Islam is more of a uniting force than divisive. Whether they come from Kazakhstan or Pakistan, it is neat to say that we can share meals together and worship together.”
There are many Middle Eastern students who practice other religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, some of whom feel religion does not bring them closer to their peers from the region.
Asher Levy, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said that though he identifies as both Syrian and Jewish, he struggles to truly define himself as Middle Eastern. Levy added that it is difficult to identify with the rest of the region given the religious divides.
“I’m sure a lot of Middle Eastern life on campus is probably religiously based,” Levy said. “A lot of that is tied in with Muslim organizations on campus, which is great. But as a practicing Jew, it’s not for me.”
Christin Toubia, a junior majoring in business administration, is a Christian, but some mistake her for a Muslim because her father hails from Sudan. As a resident of Dubai, Toubia identifies herself as Middle Eastern.
“Growing up in Dubai, one of the main issues in the Middle East that you are really exposed to is the Israeli and Palestinian conflict,” Toubia said. “I think there is a divide there.”
As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ebbs and flows, USC students in Trojans for Israel, ’SC Students for Israel and Students for Justice in Palestine have responded with peaceful demonstrations.
Though the conflict within the realm of the campus community usually remains tame and respectful, Levy said that there is still some tension between the student groups.
Though the conflict itself can be divisive, Sheikh said she doesn’t see it translating into dividing Middle Eastern students.

“Most of the people who support Israel and their policies on campus do not have a direct tie to the Middle East — most of them aren’t even Israeli,” Sheikh said. “Even for the people who are supportive of Palestine, a lot of them are not Arab. A lot of them don’t have ties to the Middle East but recognize this as an injustice towards a human entity.”
In addition to differences among students categorized as Middle Eastern, there also exist differences with how Middle Eastern students feel they are perceived by all students.
Salama feels that though culture and the media often attach a stigma to the Middle East, it does not exist at USC.
“There is a stigmatization of Middle Easterners and Arabs in general,” Salama said. “But at USC, generally everyone is welcoming and open-minded. I don’t think I’ve had any problems in terms of acceptance.”
Khorramnezhad said, however, that she feels the campus climate is not as welcoming.
“Not many people understand what the hijab is,” Khorramnezhad said. “This campus isn’t necessarily hijab-friendly.”
But the unfriendliness of some has not stopped some students from wearing the hijab. Now a senior, Sheikh has worn her hijab since her sophomore year.
“I’ve had a lot of negativity and racism directed towards me for wearing a scarf,” Sheikh said. “But that hasn’t prevented me from getting somewhere I want to be. I’m president of two organizations and I feel like I’m well-respected and people take me seriously. Of course you’ll run into people who immediately judge you based on how you look, but I’ve never had that stop me.”
Sheikh said her decision to wear her hijab is ultimately a personal one, not one that is influenced by others. She believes the intolerance some students face stems from a single-layered view of the Middle East.
“When people think Middle Eastern, they immediately think Muslim. And when they think Muslim, there’s a whole range of stereotypes tied to that,” Sheikh said.
Khorramnezhad said she feels USC’s culture can alienate many Middle Eastern students.
“Imagine someone who is Muslim, who cannot drink,” Khorramnezhad said. “Or someone who wears the hijab. Imagine how left out they must feel.”
Khorramnezhad feels that the university must do more to support Middle Eastern students, such as planning more university-wide events to help break down the stigmas associated with different cultures.
This lack of uniformity within the Middle Eastern community is a token of the intrinsic diversity of the region in which, oftentimes, no two voices are alike. Though “Middle Eastern” is used as a broad identifier, many students want to define what it means for themselves.
“It’s a mess of contradiction and conflict,” Levy said. “But it’s where my family comes from. It’s where my culture comes from. It’s everything I associate with.”

Divisions mark the 4,752 square miles that comprise what we consider to be “Los Angeles.” After all, the county includes 158 cities. And the city itself is composed of 87 neighborhoods. What’s more, most neighborhoods have a definite character that carries with it various perceptions and stereotypes.
The University Park Campus, in many ways, is no different. The campus, which spans 226 acres, is a neighborhood in its own right, with its own character and demographic makeup. Nearly 40,000 students call this university home, a significant number of whom come from other cities, states and countries. USC enrolls more international students than any other university in the United States.
And within the neighborhood of USC, with more than 850 student organizations, students associate and identify with many different communities.
We’re often used to thinking of demographics on the basis of race and ethnicity. And, over the past few weeks, the Daily Trojan has scratched the surface of what it means to belong to USC’s three highest-represented groups categorized by race and/or ethnicity. Our long-form series has explored the university experience for students who identify as black, Asian and Latino or Hispanic.
In this special edition of the Daily Trojan, we intend to not simply build off the series but to widen its scope. In these pages, you might read about the demographics of student government or about what it means to be an athlete who was recruited from a foreign country.
Admittedly, this is not an exhaustive exploration of every group on campus, but we feel that it’s a good starting point to begin a dialogue about how different groups manifest themselves at USC and within Los Angeles, a city known for its vibrant diversity. We also hope to use this opportunity to highlight aspects of groups and organizations that get lost in our daily coverage.
For us, covering the issues underlying larger organizations and populations is an ongoing project. We plan to continue building off this supplement with more content on our website and in our pages.
Though the following stories are the product of pitches from Daily Trojan editors, we encourage you, as always, to send us your letters or comment on our website to let us know what you think. Tell us about your experience at USC, and help us track the demographics of this university.

The film I, Robot, released in 2004, told the story of a futuristic society dependent on robots in the year 2035. In the film, humans rely on their robot servants, until it is suggested that it might be possible for robots to override their human superiors and, tentatively, take over the world.
Almost 10 years have passed since the movie’s release. It is the year 2013, and, thanks to the rapidly advancing technology that grows more and more powerful each day, this fictional world might not actually be too far off.
But instead of man creating robots to serve him as their servants, what if man infused himself with technology to become his own robot? This is the dream of Tim Cannon, a software developer and self-proclaimed “biohacker” from Pittsburgh who implanted a large computer chip under his skin. According to a report by Fox News, the chip is about the size of a deck of cards and, because no certified surgeon would agree to the procedure, was inserted by a piercing and tattoo specialist without any form of anesthesia.
The chip connects wirelessly to Cannon’s Android device and records his body temperature throughout the day, transmitting the information to his cellphone through a Bluetooth connection. The big chip doesn’t do a whole lot, but it’s a start to something much bigger: biohacking.
Cannon is a developer at Grindhouse Wetware, a company whose top priority “augmenting humanity using safe, affordable, open source technology,” according to Grindhouse’s website. The firm’s main goal is basically to begin the trend of “biohacking,” or further integrating the worlds of technology and biology. After all, Cannon himself has told interviewers that his dream has always been to become a robot.
Now, I must say, Cannon’s lifelong dream is a little worrisome to me. In every science-fiction film, novel, television series and elsewhere, robots are portrayed to be the very antithesis of humans: cold, unfeeling, uniform and emotionless. Humans are unique, full of emotion and creativity—the  very opposite of unfeeling. When you begin to infuse our bodies with unfamiliar and tainting technology, the very qualities that make us “human” are at risk.
Humanity is a beautiful concept, and Cannon has made it his main purpose in life to irreversibly taint others lives’ with technology. To say that you want to be a robot is basically saying that you want to give up your individuality, your ability to really feel things. And though Cannon’s dream sounds insane and somewhat idiotic, I have to say that at this point, it doesn’t seem all that unrealistic.
At the rate technology is advancing today, humans are becoming increasingly dependent on their technological gadgets. Not only are people constantly attached to their mobile devices, but new technological advances might make gadgets an even more permanent part of our lives. With the introduction of wearable devices such as Google Glass and the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch, it seems inevitable that humans will one day become one with technology.
This is quite a daunting, but ultimately realistic, possibility. Though I’m sure there will be many positive benefits to the integration of biology and technology, we must be sure to recognize that our humanity is very separate from these man-made creations and remember to preserve the aspects of humanity that make human life so unique and precious.

Using abstract concepts of “humanity” and “individuality” to argue against robotic engineering is an appeal to emotion that doesn’t really focus on the facts at hand.  While robots may be portrayed to be “cold, unfeeling, uniform, and emotionless” in sci-fi films, that doesn’t reflect on the actual potential uses of robotic engineering.  In addition, robotic engineering could be used to save, enhance, and lengthen lives.  While there definitely are potential moral and ethical questions that arise from robotic engineering, I believe it is best to adopt a veiwpoint based on the science behind the engineering, rather than one stemming from emotion.

The media loves elections. Though 2013 is neither a general nor midterm election year, news outlets seem to enjoy speculating on future elections. This year specifically has focused on the gubernatorial elections, such as those in New Jersey and Virginia. The media has sensationalized them as if their speculations are accurate predictions for the presidential election in 2016. But this fixation on an unending election cycle only increases voter fatigue and widens partisan divisions about who will “win” the upcoming election next time around. Though state elections are certainly newsworthy, national media should stop using them as excuses to speculate on the next round of candidates in the 2016 elections.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
News outlets have particularly focused on Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, as a viable nominee for the presidency in 2016. Though he was re-elected only last night political analysts are already looking ahead at his future in the GOP. Late polling results makes his re-election seem inevitable, and should he win the governor’s mansion again, Christie will have achieved a rare feat as a Republican governor in a largely Democratic state. Notably, Christie also played a pivotal role in the 2012 elections. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the governor very publicly worked with President Barack Obama in order to speed recovery efforts at both state and federal levels.
Though Christie is certainly a national figure, the media should stop painting him as a potential party nominee. As a recent NBC News article asked, “Centrist or a conservative? Christie faces fork in the road for 2016.” The fact remains that the 2016 elections are three years away. Even by American standards of lengthy campaigns, it is simply too early to begin speculation. Though the 2014 midterm elections are somewhat closer, Americans should not have to be subjected to the media’s never-ending fascination with elections.
Though political junkies will surely be interested in almost any election, such media preoccupation with every election has the effect of alienating more casual voters who might only vote in major elections. In New Jersey, for example, an earlier October election to fill a vacant Senate seat garnered a paltry nine percent of voters. Even before his win in that election, Cory Booker was hailed as a “Democrat darling” and “rising star” of the Democratic party, according to Fox News. Are these terms simply the first steps in next calling him a potential nominee in 2016? Past election history seems to answer that question affirmatively. The media is undoubtedly responsible for over-hyping almost every election and thus reducing the value of all elections collectively.
Media speculation in the Virginia gubernatorial race further shows problems with media hype. The political battle in that state has become so sensationalized by the media and outside interests that there has been little focus on real issues of importance to Virginia voters. The candidates in the race, Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli, have instead both focused on personal attacks. According to CNN, “The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns.” The Virginia race has included appeals from Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton on behalf of McAuliffe, while Cuccinelli has also been endorsed by national Republican figures. These outside influences, however, have little impact on issues specific to Virginia. Instead, the Virginia race has turned into what a lot of other state elections turn into: testing grounds for strategies to try in bigger national and general elections.
This strategy, employed by both Democrats and Republicans, often goes against the best interests of voters in a state. This year in Virginia, voters and non-voters were witness to a highly charged and negative campaign as both parties sought to win the state and prove that momentum was on their side for 2016. According to the local news, the Richmond Times-Dispatch, “In recent interviews in Chesapeake [Virgina], voters agreed that the race for governor has become too negative, with too little focus on the issues that matter to Virginians and too much emphasis on why ‘the other guy’ should not get elected.”
Undoubtedly, political parties bear some of the blame for this 2016 election madness as they constantly try to calculate their strategies for the next big election cycle. The media, however, is at fault for its tiresome and ultimately meaningless speculation of what will happen in the 2016 campaign.

On Tuesday, the Bipartisan Policy Center Housing Commission hosted a forum entitled Housing America’s Future — “New Directions for National Policy” which discussed details of a report about the housing crisis in America released by the commission earlier this year.
The all-day event featured a series of speeches and panels on topics including demographic trends in housing markets, housing finance reform, links between housing and healthcare and the role of energy efficacy in housing. Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services, delivered the keynote address and provided a preview of her hope for legislation and efforts currently underway in congress.
“Best case scenario, the Senate moves first [to pass a bill] but I don’t think it will happen this year,” Waters said in the discussion following her address. “I think it’s a little too complicated and there’s too much work still to be done on it but I do believe that we will have housing reform.”
Former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros, who serves as co-chair of the Housing Commission that authored the report, said that it was important to bring Forums such as this one to the West Coast to stress the importance of policy on a local level and complement work being done in Washington.
“The report was somewhat East Coast centric,” Cisneros said. “But USC is such an opinion leader. If you want the intellectual capital of the West, it’s here. There’s an aggregation of talent.”
Furthermore, Cisneros said housing is at the core the social issues debate and college students, as future renters or buyers, play a key role in shaping that debate.
“Every other social objective depends on answering a fundamental question, where a family will sleep tonight.” Cisneros said.
The forum was the first of its kind held by the Bipartisan Policy Center on a college campus.
“Our goal is to examine federal housing policy what went wrong and where we need to go with reform. What we hope to do, and we think we have achieved to some extent already, is to be the catalyst to united the public policy debate,” said Pam Patenaude, director of Housing Policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center.  “The future of housing is dependent on[ the young] generation certainly [coming to] college campuses makes sense so we can get students involved.”
Discussions aim to address past errors made in the housing market and emphasize the importance of educating younger generations and the importance of developing financial literacy.
“We assumed the borrower understood what we understood and we can start with a better job of explaining what exists,” said Christopher George of CGM Financial, which provides housing loans. “We’re moving out of a stage where we’re placing blame and starting to think about where we’re headed.”
One other point of discussion was shifting demographics and the influence of minorities on the housing market. According to Enrique Lopezlira of the National Council of La Reza, a Hispanic rights and advocacy organization, a disproportionate number of minorities including African-Americans and Hispanics were turned down for loans in 2012.
Melany De La Cruz-Viesca, assistant director of UCLA’s Asian American studies center, said a majority of Asian American assets were decimated as a result of the foreclosure crisis. The solution to the problem, however, is not simple.
“My major takeaway is that when it comes down to trying to get private industries, public govern entities and potential consumers — it’s complex. There’s no easy solution and that’s a good thing. There shouldn’t be a one size fits all policy or product that addresses the problem.”
Regardless of what form the solution eventually takes, Cisneros said it is essential that the housing debate be addressed.
“It’s important to not allow it to be divided by partisan politics,” he said. “This is one of those situations where failure is not an option.”

I have long admired Representative Maxine Waters and the dedication she brings to Congress. We need more like her. I am confident that with her leadership, we can make substantial progress in housing reform.

Minorities are underrepresented in popular films, according to a recent study which looked at character roles in movies from 2007 to 2012, released last Wednesday by USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
The study, which examined 500 top-grossing movies released at the box office over that six-year period and 20,000 speaking characters, found biases in the way certain races were depicted. For instance, Hispanic women were likely to play sexualized roles, while black male characters were the least likely demographic to appear in committed relationships.
The report is the latest in a series of studies Annenberg is conducting on race, gender and ethnicity.
“We are interested in the portrayals of diversity in media,” said associate professor Stacy L. Smith, the study’s principal investigator.
Many students said they were bothered by the typecasting of minorities by Hollywood that the study showed.
“My dad is a [black] actor so this kind of hits home,” said Anaka Morris, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “He tends to play policemen or criminals.”
Students said this pattern of pigeonholing minority actors to stereotypical roles is frustrating.
“Asians are portrayed as socially awkward and unadjusted to American culture,” said Tiffany Kuan, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
The study found that 76.3 percent of all speaking characters in the movies examined were white. Ryan Green, a sophomore majoring in critical studies said this underrepresentation of races was not surprising sees a pattern of minor roles being given to minorities.
“There are a lot of comedy movies where they have a black side character that makes all the quips. But [the character] is always extraneous,” Green said.
The imbalanced casting might be the result of underrepresented non-white directors. Only 33 of the 565 directors of top-grossing movies were black, and only two were black women.
Researchers found a strong correlation between a director’s race and the race of his or her cast. When a non-black director casted a film, 9.9 percent of speaking characters were black. Under a black director, 52.6 percent of speaking characters were black.
“A lot of Oscar-winning films don’t have minorities unless [they] are set during slavery. Why can’t we just have an Oscar-winning film with colored actors that doesn’t have to do with race?” Morris said.
Some said that the unequal representation of minorities in film could be easily overlooked, especially if viewers aren’t aware that there is a disparity.
“It’s sad to say this, but it’s an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ problem,” said Michael Lim, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering. “We don’t realize it until we think about it.”
Likewise, Morris said she isn’t conscious of race when watching films.
“I’m so used to watching movies with all white people acting that I don’t even question it anymore,” she said.
The USC research team behind the study hopes that their findings introduce a conversation with and about the film industry.
“One of the most rewarding aspects of this research is observing the impact it has had on our students at Annenberg,” Project Administrator Marc Choueiti said. “It is great to watch them become thoughtful and critical consumers of the media.”
Choueiti said the research is important to consider because mainstream films fail to reflect the world their audiences live in.
“All individuals deserve a chance to be seen and heard, and when some groups are underrepresented in top-grossing films we lose that opportunity,” he said.
Morris, who plans to enter the entertainment industry after graduation, said she hopes that she can help to change the status quo one day.
“I hate Madea,” she said. “The first few Tyler Perry movies I saw bothered me. … I just want to make films with more diversity in portrayals of race.”

I wonder if people in India or Hong Kong are complaining that there isn’t enough white people in their movies. We have turned into more of a racist society only because we have moved the goal posts as far as what we consider a slight on minorities. 
BTW – why are we only outraged with the profession of acting and producing movies? Why are we not complaining that there aren’t enough black commercial airplane pilots? How about every airline has to use unspoken affirmative action to hire a black pilot – regardless of actual qualifications – and o on your next flight you might have a subpar pilot who is flying the plane because he was graded on a curve based on skin color?
Haven’t we gone too far with this politically correct nonsense?

On Monday, the USC Women’s Student Assembly began celebrating Body Love Week, a series of events promoting the reconceptualization of beauty and healthy body image.

WSA Co-Director Kaya Masler said she was excited to integrate the program into the assembly.
“We’ve celebrated Body Love Week before, but this is our first full week of programming,” Masler said. “We heightened the initiative after taking the temperature on campus and responding to a lot of the really unhealthy, body-negative comments that we were hearing. It’s something almost no woman doesn’t deal with.”
Events began Monday with a kickoff celebration involving henna, body decorations and a photo campaign. The director of Body Love Week, Jasmine Aguilar, was largely inspired by similar movements she found while doing research on other events meant to promote healthy self-image.
“In the Boulder Youth Body Alliance, they wrote messages about their body somewhere on their body,” Aguilar said. “[Some] were really funny like, ‘My heart is bigger than my butt,’ or they had really serious ones that said, ‘I’m sorry for every time I said I hated you,’ or ‘I am really proud of what my body can do rather than how it looks. I really want to spread those kinds of messages across campus as much as I can.”
The events attempt to counter beauty ideals deeply embedded within society, which Aguilar said can affect virtually everyone.
“We’re all held up to a specific ideal of what beauty is, Aguilar said. “For or a lot of what I’ve seen it’s very heteronormative; it’s very ‘blonde hair, blue eyes, skinny,’ [and] for men it’s ‘muscular.’ So I just want to explore, and help others explore, other ideas of what beauty means.”
Some students said they believe these norms have become embedded in society.
“Almost every political, social, economic structure favors white, cisgendered, straight people, whether it’s women or men, so if you don’t fall into that category then you might have issues with yourself,” Lena Melillo, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said. “Colonialism is what instituted those values in the first place, so even if media is the vehicle that presents them, it’s not necessarily the media’s fault.”
Melillo said she believes larger social problems can also contribute to widespread body negativity.
“Things like racism are really bad for body image. Not just in the United States, but in many countries, lighter skin is seen as more beautiful,” she said.
The Body Love movement started on a global scale, from outrage at size discrimination in the fashion industry.
“There have been a lot of companies in recent light that refuse to sell clothes for women who are above a size large, or above a size 8, or don’t sell any sort of plus sizes,” Aguilar said. “So a lot of them have been bringing a lot of attention to size and what it means to be a fat woman, and a fat man as well, in society and looking deeper into that.”
Since then, the movement has spanned several campaigns similar to, perhaps most famously, the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty. Despite the publicity of the Dove campaign and other mainstream movements, Aguilar said Body Love at USC will be more inclusive.
“Dove does a lot of diversity in women, specifically in weight. I wanted to expand on body diversity more than in terms of just size; I wanted to expand on able-bodied, I wanted to expand on race and gender, and everything in between in terms of intersectionality,” she said. “I wanted it all across the board as much as I possibly could in four days.”
The week’s events range from a documentary screening about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people of color who are disabled, called Sins Invalid, to a “BDSM: Fact and Fiction” workshop in partnership with the  Queer and Ally Student Assembly.
For Aguilar, her involvement in the Body Love movement came out of personal struggles with her own self-image.
“Since I was in middle school, I’ve had an eating disorder, so coming here to USC it was difficult to find a group, or a group of people, or a group of friends that I could disclose that to,” she said. “I felt really alone in the fact that I hated my body and the fact that I was different from everyone else I’d come into contact with. Everyone else seemed so confident.”
Aguilar said she hopes Body Love Week will reach out to those who might be feeling similarly uncomfortable with their bodies.
“I think it’s really easy to say that everyone else around you is beautiful and to appreciate everyone else’s body, but when it comes to yourself, we are told that we have to be harsher on ourselves,” she said. “So I really want everyone to see themselves in a more positive light.”
Melillo agreed that a negative body image has serious implications, both for individuals and society as a whole.
“If you have positive body image, then you’re more confident, and you’re able to better communicate your ideas to people,” she said. “If you’re feeling self-conscious, you’re inside of your head and you’re less likely to be able to communicate with people in meaningful ways.”
