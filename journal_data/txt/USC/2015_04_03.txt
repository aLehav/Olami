There seems to be hype with different food crazes in this era. Gluten-free, vegan, pescetarian, dairy-free, vegetarian — the options are endless. I follow a gluten-free diet since the beginning of high school purely because I am allergic. I like to say that I jumped on the bandwagon before it was chic.
This past summer though I began a new journey with food and decided to cut out meat, excluding sushi, because I am too much of a raw fish lover! The decision to become pescetarian started because of a class I took during my Maymester program — Gero498: Nutrition, Genes, Longevity and Disease, which absolutely changed my life and my perception of food. My professor, the great Valter Longo, who I am convinced will cure cancer one day, preached the benefits of a Vegan Pescetarian diet. He believes that all age-related diseases — cardiovascular malfunction, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cancers — can be slowed depending on the food that we consume. I believe that aging is not only what you eat, but also a combination of your genetics, exercise, lifestyle as well as your environment.
The vegan diet is one that I find very difficult to maintain, so I adopted the pescetarian part of his recommendation. I have been meat-free for about nine months now, starting from when this class ended and I must say I don’t feel intensely different, but I do feel a sense of cleanliness throughout my body that is much more evident to me. So many of the meat products we consume are heavily processed and half of the time we barely know what we even are eating. Cutting out meat allows you to take in more beneficial nutrients and fewer harmful components, but it’s only healthy if you are eating a balanced diet with plenty of other nutrient-dense foods. I find that it isn’t quite hard to find substitutes of protein; you just have to dig a bit. Here are some of my favorites:
Finding new ways to change up your diet keeps things fresh. You should enjoy what you eat and feel good because of it. Food is our fuel, so might as well put healthy, organic and clean things into our engine. Now if you start this meatless lifestyle, make sure you eat eating a mix of colors to get different types of heath-promoting, free-radical-fighting antioxidants.

Spring is universally known as the season of new beginnings, but in Japan, I feel it even more so than I did back in the States. The white-pink petals of cherry blossoms flutter in the wind, settle to the ground and sail in the streams. Beneath them, there are people sprawled on tarps, drinking and laughing or otherwise passed out in a drunken heap. (Drinking in public spaces is legal in Japan.) Spring is also the start of a new school year in Japan, and at night, there are huge groups of students blocking the streets on their way to “compa,” or drinking parties to welcome new club members.
This week was also Waseda University’s “shinkan” event, meant to welcome incoming freshmen. You could hardly see the campus for all the new students and club booths, filled with sempai (senior members) calling for recruits. The international circle I am apart of was there too, in its characteristic bright pink t-shirts, handing out bright pink flyers, and asking, “How would you like to participate in cultural exchange?” I wandered around, occasionally picking up flyers and listening to explanations of various clubs, with activities ranging from star-gazing to music to stroll-taking.
At night, I went to a “hanami,” or flower-viewing session with three other close friends. The four of us sat on a bench, opened up our cans of sake and drank to friendship and the start of a new semester. Looking at their faces and at the white cherry petals scattered about us like snow, I felt a little sad all of a sudden. Cherry blossoms in Japan are beautiful, but also mean ephemerality, and are thus often seen to represent human life or fleeting events. I don’t want to think that my own time in Japan is fleeting, but I know it is. For now, at least, it is spring and I am welcoming a new beginning and a new semester.

The Netflix original series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt combines the writing talents of quick-witted Tina Fey and an endearing performance by Ellie Kemper as the show’s eponymous protagonist. The combination of smart and hilarious writing, lovable characters, and a killer theme song have captured viewers’ hearts and taught them a few lessons, too. Kimmy, who, along with a few other “mole women,” is rescued from a doomsday cult after 15 years in a bunker, ends up starting the next chapter of her life in New York. Though she struggles to find her way, she quickly makes friends and uses the survival skills she learned in the bunker to persevere through adversity. Here are some of the things we can all learn from (the unbreakable) Kimmy Schmidt.
1. Be confident in yourself even if it means being wrong sometimes.


 
3. …but that doesn’t mean you can’t feel bad for yourself sometimes.

 

5. Don’t be afraid to be unique! You do you. (Pinot Nooooir)

6. It’s okay to be a little naive sometimes.

 
7. Don’t forget to appreciate the little things in life.
