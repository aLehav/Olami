Alexis Areias and Lucy Warren were sworn as the 2021-22 Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president, respectively, at Tuesday’s Senate meeting. Their tenure begins just over a month after they won the election with 53.9% of the vote. 
Chief Justice of the USC Judicial Council Ben Morain also swore in the 12 newly elected senators alongside Areias and Warren. 
Areias and Warren did not deliver an inaugural address, opting to share a video statement at a future date. When making the announcement for not delivering an address after being sworn in, Areias cited the length of the final 140th Senate meeting, which ran about an hour and a half.
During the final open forum of the 140th Senate on April 6, several students expressed concerns over the newly appointed chief of staff, former Sen. Max Gomez. Antonio Okeke, who ran against Areias and Warren, spoke out against Gomez’s nomination to the position, saying that he misused his senatorial office by communicating with 2021 USG candidates. 
According to the USG Elections Commission’s hearing verdict Feb. 18, the case — brought on by Safal Mengi, campaign manager for the Shreya Chaudhary and Okeke ticket — alleged that Gomez and Sen. Ruben Romeo used their senatorial platforms to influence students to vote for the Areias and Warren ticket. The case further alleged the winning presidential candidates knew of the infraction. Gomez was found to have violated election code IV.E.1. and sanctioned by the Commission, including recusing himself from USG election matters during his former senatorial term.
Okeke’s concerns were first addressed by Alyssa Delarosa, a junior majoring in psychology, who ignited the discussion on this topic during open forum. 
“[The student body doesn’t] trust someone who was gifted such an incredible opportunity and privilege as a USG senator and then decides that their position doesn’t even matter enough for them to uphold basic integrity, basic honesty and integrity,” Delarosa said about Gomez’s election violation.
Anna Rodriguez, a member of the Elections Commission, responded to these claims, saying that the sanctions implemented by the Commission were “to prevent Senator Gomez from impacting the 2021 USG elections any more than had already occurred.” 
“The intentions behind our original sanctions were not set in place to prohibit Senator Gomez from seeking future office in USG, as that would be a clear violation of our goals to act with fairness and morale,” Rodriguez said. 
The concerns raised against Gomez were further addressed during the USG Cabinet Officer appointments during Tuesday’s meeting. Delarosa and Okeke were yielded time by senators to speak again on Gomez’s actions during the election and his appointment to chief of staff. Areias and Warren both responded, with Areias acknowledging her friendship with Gomez predating USG.
“Alexis and I are two different people, and we’re both making [Gomez’s] nomination,” Warren said. “I really truly believe we’ve found the best candidates, and we will create the USG I know that we have preached through our time as candidates.”
Following discussion, the USG Cabinet passed, including Gomez’s nomination, with nine votes in favor and former Sens. Areias and Gomez abstaining. 
Unfinished business for the 140th Senate included addressing the Resolution for Dining Hall and Food Waste and the Gatekeeper Training Resolution, both passing unanimously after undergoing several clerical, grammatical and minor amendments. 
Following inauguration, newly elected senators began working on their first items of new business for the 141st Senate, including seven legislative branch appointments and the Kosher Dining Resolution, which looks to offer an equitable kosher dining plan to USC students.

Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, teams of volunteers and community members have been canvassing door-to-door in the houses of East Los Angeles to determine if people are eligible for the coronavirus vaccine. Currently, L.A. County is in Phase 1B of the vaccination distribution process which includes anyone 50 years or older, people with health conditions and disabilities and people working in healthcare, education, childcare, emergency services, maintenance, transportation and food and agriculture. Starting April 15, all individuals over 16 will be eligible for vaccination.
Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, associate dean for community initiatives at the Keck School of Medicine, has collaborated with a variety of organizations to promote messaging on the virus and help with the vaccination process. Her Stay Connected Los Angeles project focused on Latinx communities in East L.A. who are 65 years and older. 
“We’ve been able to [vaccinate] thousands of people literally, many of them who would have probably not been able to come in,” said Baezconde-Garbanati, who has been working in public health for over 20 years. “We really jumped on that part of the effort and got a team together to alleviate some of the issues that people were facing in terms of the logistics of getting vaccinated.”
With the success of the project, Baezconde-Garbanati — who also serves as the chair of the board of directors of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health — was invited by the White House COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to present her work on Stay Connected Los Angeles to help the task force determine the next course of action for the nation in addressing disparities between different groups of people. The NAHH recently received a grant to work with 18 other organizations across the country on grassroots level efforts focused on coronavirus vaccinations among people from the Latinx community. 
“What’s happening is the task force is gathering information from multiple different groups and people in order to develop the best strategy at the federal level to be able to reach people in the most effective way,” said Baezconde-Garbanati. 
Stay Connected LA first started in order to provide a more impactful way of promoting information on the virus. Then, the year-old project grew to provide more support for Latinx communities who lacked the resources to get the vaccine. 
Challenges like the digital divide, misinformation and vaccine hesitancy have made it difficult for people to feel safe and to have access to the proper tools to schedule appointments and go to vaccine sites. According to the L.A. County Department of Public Health, Latinos make up 64% of L.A. County’s COVID-19 cases, and 53% of coronavirus deaths in L.A. County are from the Latinx population. These cases and death rates persist despite the fact that Hispanics and Latinos account for only 48.6% of the county’s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  
To combat this, the project collaborated with many community partners to get shuttle buses to bring people to the Keck Medical Center for vaccines. They also called about 96 churches and multiple organizations, and went door-to-door to determine vaccine eligibility. 
“One of the folks that we had acclimated said to one of our workers, ‘You’re giving me a chance at life… I would have never been vaccinated because I didn’t know where to go, who to talk to.’ She was 65 and older and she had two sons that had both left home… so she didn’t even know how to go about any of this and was not planning on getting vaccinated,” said Baezconde-Garbanati. 
Funded by the Keck Foundation, the project team also worked with local artists in the community who created images and messages to educate and inform people about proper hand-washing, mask-wearing and tackling vaccine hesitancy. From there, the project evolved to collaborate with other teams and organizations to become one unified outreach project to help Hispanic individuals get access to the vaccine.  
“We’d always intended from the start to have those sort of layers [in the project] that will be needed for people that just have more barriers and more challenges with adopting some of the things,” said Dr. Kayla de la Haye, the co-primary investigator who also spearheaded the project with Baezconde-Garbanati. “We want to get this messaging out, and this art that really gets people thinking about this and changing their mind, but there’s going to be a group of folks who have way more barriers to getting vaccinated… For that group of people we’re really going to work with community organizations and promotores de salud [health workers in Spanish-speaking communities] to have higher touch support for certain higher risk populations.”
Eleven East L.A.-based artists are currently working on their designs and concepts, which will be released between late April and May. The project also plans on having a digital art festival in the late summer or early fall. All of the artwork is culturally inspired by the local community and their insight to resonate with Latinx culture.
“They’re the vehicles that are getting a lot of this information out to people, and so they’re doing all of these amazing projects from billboards to GIFs. I’m working with an artist who’s putting up COVID-related art on a stairwell in East L.A.,” said de la Haye. “They’re just super passionate about doing that for their community and helping their communities recover and move through this and they’ve had so many amazing ideas.” 
Jane Steinberg, assistant professor of clinical preventive medicine and secondary researcher in the project, has facilitated meetings with the artists, town halls and focus groups to achieve a more democratic process. 
“This was very much community based participatory research. This is the community guiding what they think the messages should be from the artists, as opposed to us researchers coming in and saying, ‘Okay, we’re going to do this for your community, whether you like it or not,’” said Steinberg. 
Baezconde-Garbanati is also working on another project, Vaccinate Los Angeles, with the help of a creative agency, WONDROS, to expand messaging on the coronavirus and vaccine access to Latinos and African Americans in L.A. County. She emphasizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and the need for vaccinations for as many people as possible in order to establish a new normal. 
“There’s been many bad things about COVID, but there’s been many good things also that we’ve learned through COVID. I think that some people have had awful experiences; so many deaths, so much illness. Yet at the same time, there’s been images of hope — children that have been born, grandchildren that have been born and people are finally getting to hug them and see them,” said Baezconde-Garbanati. “I think COVID has helped us [reassess our core values] because we’ve been so isolated that we’ve realized the value of a family, of our friends … and we want to feel those people again.”

Kelly Clarkson once said, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” When that iconic 2011 bop came out I was a 13-year-old skinnymalinks with a mouth full of braces and a sexy set of side bangs. I memorized every word to that song and sang it as if I’d lived through some serious hardship that totally jaded me. When the chorus rolled around and that beat dropped, I’d strike a pose and belt out, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger…” 
Flash forward to 2018. I’m sitting in my doctor’s office waiting room, curled up in a ball, hood pulled over my eyes, melting from pain and furious that nothing was working to treat it. I was desperately trying to block out the Pandora radio blasting through the tinny ceiling speakers until that fateful guitar line kicked in. As the song crescendoed to the chorus and the beat dropped, Kelly belted out that seminal line, and something unexpected occurred. 
I felt my blood begin to boil. My cheeks and ears were red hot, literally. I didn’t feel kinship with Kelly — I felt betrayed. Cheated. Lied to. What does she mean what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger? I spend every day fighting chronic illness that causes pain beyond description, so, no, I reject the idea that my suffering makes me stronger. I don’t want it to make me stronger; I want it to go away, forever.
However, in all my fury I had an epiphany. Kelly’s lyric did one thing successfully: It made me think about the total paradox that is living in chronic pain. Let me explain. 
While I agree with my girl that, yes, I refuse to let my pain kill me, in the same breath, I disagree because, no, I don’t believe being in chronic pain has led to this sparkly amazing journey of personal growth. It f-ing sucks, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy for the sake of it making them stronger or teaching them something about life. 
And that is where I find myself presently stuck in this paradox — feeling like I’m living in a constant state of contradiction. Where one moment I’m crying because my pain levels on a daily basis are unacceptable, and the next I forcibly collect and tell myself an all-too-common line to justify suffering: “But at least I’m not dying.” 
That’s where Kelly’s lyric really gut-punched me. What if she’s wrong, and my chronic pain that feels like it’s trying to kill me actually wins? What if I crumble under the weight of all this pain, and I don’t rise from the metaphorical ashes like an early-2000s bedazzled butterfly? What if I just want to leave my body for a bit and take a break from being confined in skin that feels like it’s bursting with inflammation and pain?
And here’s the deep, dark Kelly-kicker: Who am I if I admit out loud that sometimes I think about the peace and final relief that comes with death?
I was forced to confront the fact that my pain wasn’t going away any time soon. I was forced to reconcile with the truth that my chronic illness and chronic pain were just that — chronic — with no expiration date. 
It definitely didn’t happen overnight, and it’s something I’m still working on, but I found that living in a contradictory state of I-hate-my-chronic-pain-but-at-least-I’m-not-dying is just as crushing as the chronic pain itself.
More importantly, escaping that state of contradiction is not as easy as simply having a positive attitude. Let me make that clear for the people in the back: A positive attitude will never cure an inherent illness.
Although, changing my attitude towards my chronic pain did do something. It took time, but finally realizing my juxtaposing emotions of  I-will-fight-I-can’t-take-this-anymore gave me emotional relief. I’ll never say shifting my attitude gave me ultimate clarity and peace with my circumstances. In the end what it did do was allow me to loosen the vice-like grip of black-and-white thinking I had around chronic pain. It helped me comprehend that I’m allowed to feel two things at once. 
I can be angry about my circumstances and still be profoundly humbled by them. I can hate my body for the pain it causes me, but I can also love my body for keeping me upright to do the things I’m passionate about. I can hate the depression and anxiety I feel living in fear of a flare, while also bowing down to this beautiful vessel for my soul which makes me who I am. 
I’ve come to understand that changing my attitude towards my chronic pain doesn’t equate to accepting the amount of physical pain I’m in. It means choosing to try my best despite daily physical and mental challenges. 
Ultimately, the challenge I do accept is to find the adventure — however that may look — in the face of such uncertainty, unpredictability and contradiction. It’s taken the support of my team of doctors, an amazing therapist, a family I can rely on for anything and my ride-or-die BFFs to see what they’ve always known — that you can be in chronic pain and still have a meaningful and fabulous life, just in a new, different and unexpected way.
So maybe Kelly actually did get one thing right. I just had to reframe my thinking and keep on singing to the next line, which is more in line with my thinking now: “What doesn’t kill you makes you a fighter, footsteps even lighter.”

Imagine dying in a cold, crowded cell crammed with hundreds of bunkbeds and even more people, who — like you — are doing the best they can to survive. 
Imagine dying in a place where the only hospice care you have is the volunteer company of other incarcerated people who try to understand and sympathize with you. 
Imagine that, over the years, you have watched people you have come to know, love and mentor say their goodbyes and disappear behind the tall iron gate, leaving you behind to rebuild a life for themselves. Watching them go is bittersweet — you are proud knowing that they will have a better life and more opportunities but also sad that you will never experience the feeling of freedom yourself. 
You have experienced personal growth over the decades you spent in the cool confines of prison. You barely recognize the person you were when you were convicted. You have acquired many certificates, continued your education, reunified bonds with your loved ones, found your spirituality and read books that you never would have found interest in if you were not incarcerated. 
But, despite this continual growth, the life without parole sentence that you were given so many years ago prohibits you from ever leaving the institution. You are left to die on a cot, never to fulfill your hopes and dreams.
Life without parole is a type of sentencing that requires the convicted person to serve out the rest of their life in prison. In some cases, this is an alternative to the death penalty, meant to keep the most severe cases off the streets and away from society. 
But for most people, this is an unfair ruling that they eventually outgrow, as most people “age out” of criminal behavior, according to The Sentencing Project, a non profit organization that produces research about sentencing policies and racial disparities. With children as young as 13 getting juvenile life sentences and 1 in 5 incarcerated Black people serving life sentences, it is imperative that this form of sentencing be reevaluated and abolished in favor of a more rehabilitative process that will allow the incarcerated a chance to reintegrate back into society.
According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 2,500 children have been given a juvenile life sentence without parole in the United States. However, the average human brain isn’t fully developed until the age of 25, and even then, they are still experiencing personal growth based on acquired experiences and knowledge. It is unethical to sentence somebody to spend the rest of their life in prison when they can’t comprehend the consequences of their actions, let alone their life in five to 10 years. 
Rather than giving lifetime punishments, officials and administrators within the prison industrial complex should opt for rehabilitative and restorative justice and provide incarcerated people with tools to aid their personal growth and development to allow and empower them to make a change in their lives and strive for freedom. This should be made retroactive so that it applies to all 162,000 incarcerated individuals already incarcerated serving a life sentence.
By giving incarcerated individuals the opportunity to better themselves and eventually return home, they have an incentive to use their time productively and take more positive actions for themselves and others. While many may be skeptical about the phenomenal change that would come with reintegrating “lifers” back into society, it would decrease mass incarceration and allow innocent families of the incarcerated “lifers” to connect outside of visitation walls.
When many think of a person who is serving life without parole, they envision a remorseless convicted murderer. However, of those cases, over 17,000 individuals serving life have been convicted of a nonviolent offense. 
These crimes may range from stealing or burglary to drug possession or sales. Additionally, people who are serving life sentences for murder may have been charged with aiding and abetting or participancy because they had been at the scene of the crime but had no intention or active role in murder. 
Regardless of whether or not the incarcerated person serving a life sentence deserves a harsh conviction, most will age out of the behavior that put them there in the first place. According to the Justice Policy Institute, older adults who are incarcerated have a 3% recidivism rate and are considered to be low risk.
Additionally, life imprisonment disproportionately affects and disenfranchises Black communities, as 48.3% of “lifers” and those serving sentences greater than 50 years are Black people. As with all conviction types within the prison industrial system, the disproportionate presence and sentencing of Black people creates profound disparity. 
According to The Sentencing Project, Black people make up more than two-thirds of the life without parole population in nine states, and 33.3% of California’s 40,691-person life without parole population. Black people account for 13% of the U.S.’ population, but they are far more represented in the life-without-parole population than any other race, demonstrating the bias and modern segregation perpetuated by prisons.
In order to safely decrease the number of incarcerated individuals serving life sentences while also promoting rehabilitation, prisons should offer parole to all life sentences based on meritorious credit and second look sentencing, regardless of life without parole status. 
Meritorious credit and “good time”  are systems which allow incarcerated people to earn credits towards shortening their sentence by participating in educational, vocational, work or rehabilitative programs. 
In many cases, offenders lack the guidance, personal experience, education or wisdom that would come with age to be able to realize and understand the full extent of their choices. By engaging in these programs, incarcerated people learn how to become more productive members of society. Granting “lifers” parole would give them an incentive to participate in these programs.
With more than 200,000 individuals serving life or virtual sentences (50 years of more), granting parole to incarcerated individuals serving life without parole may be key to eliminating mass incarceration. These individuals deserve the chance to grow and reintegrate back into society. As a society, we should be more open to the idea of rehabilitation and reform for a rehabilitative justice system and ending life without parole may be the first step toward this.

Since Bill Clinton unseated George H. W. Bush in the 1992 presidential election, the GOP has only won the presidency with a majority of the popular vote once. This was in 2004, when, in the wake of 9/11, George W. Bush (50.7%) had a decisive victory over John Kerry (48.3%).  
However, Republicans have won the White House in three elections since 1992. Besides 2004, they won in 2000 — George W. Bush (47.9%) over Al Gore (48.4%) — and 2016 — Donald Trump (46%) over Hillary Clinton (48.1%).
These two wins were only possible because of the Electoral College, which puts more weight on votes from less populous states relative to the weight it puts on votes from more populous ones. For instance, in 2016 the Washington Post calculated the weight of a Wyoming vote to be 3.6 times that of a California vote.
The Electoral College is an anti-democratic oddity of American presidential elections, resulting from a compromise between the Constitution’s framers. Some of them believed the president ought to be chosen by Congress, while others believed this power should reside in the people. No other democracy existed for the United States to model its own after at the time, so the debate is understandable. 
However, it is telling, as Harvard Kennedy School Professor Alex Keyssar points out, the process “does not conform to democratic principles the nation has publicly championed … [and has] never [been] imitated by another country or by any state of the U.S.” David Weigel of the Washington Post perhaps best captures its irony: “There’s only one office in this country you can win without the popular support of most voters, and it happens to be the most powerful one in the world.”
The Electoral College was not the only anti-democratic compromise arrived by the Founding Fathers. There was also, of course, the notorious Three-fifths Compromise. And there was the “Great Compromise,” which, like the Electoral College, still affects American politics today. 
The “Great Compromise” between small and large states agreed upon two systems of congressional representation: the House of Representatives, where seats were assigned according to a state’s population, and the Senate, where “equal representation” of two senators was assigned to each state. In 2013, this meant that six senate votes from California, Texas and New York represented the same amount of people as 62 Senate votes from the smallest 31 states.
The last time Republican Senators represented a popular majority of the vote was in 1996 when they represented 50.3% of the population to the Democrat’s 49.7%. Nonetheless, Republicans controlled the Senate from 1995 to 2001, 2003 to 2007 and 2015 to 2021.
The Senate holds certain powers that the House does not, including approving treaties and Supreme Court Justice nominations. This has allowed Senate majorities that do not represent the majority of the American population’s desires to block Supreme Court nominees such as Merrick Garland or appoint Justices to an increasingly conservative Supreme Court (all W. Bush and Trump appointees). 
One would have to be very naïve to believe Republicans’ aggressive agenda in the last two decades comes from a convenient ignorance of the desires of the majority of the American public. In reality, the GOP is all too aware that it is a disproportionately represented minority. Thus, their aggressiveness in policy is not only matched but surpassed in another area: their aggressiveness in holding on to power. 
One of the most cited examples of political manipulation is gerrymandering: redrawing the boundaries of electoral districts so that one party is unfairly advantaged. While both parties are complicit in gerrymandering districts, one party’s reliance on the method is clearly more substantial. 
According to Business Insider, in 2016, there were  “four times” more states gerrymandered so that their House or Assembly districts unfairly favored Republicans. Additionally, gerrymandering allowed Republicans to win up to 22 more U.S. House seats than they should have been able to based on the average vote share in congressional districts across the country.
District lines are redrawn every 10 years with each new Census. The next redistricting will come in 2022, meaning that state legislators elected in the 2020 cycle will draw the new district boundaries. 
This is great news for Republicans. Even after they lost the presidency and both houses of Congress, Republicans “won big” in state elections. After all, 2020 came ten years after “Project Redmap,” the unprecedented Republican effort to gain control of U.S. state legislatures and redraw districts to their advantage. Perhaps this is why Senate Republicans are now threatening to use the filibuster to derail a law that would end partisan gerrymandering for good.
The subtle manipulation of gerrymandering is one thing, but after months of Trump’s incendiary lies about election fraud, Republicans feel more emboldened than ever. According to the Washington Post, since the election, more than 250 new voting laws have been proposed by Republicans in 43 states to create voting hurdles for “tens of millions of voters.”
In the words of Alice O’Lenick, the Republican chair of the Gwinnett County elections board in Georgia, “they’ve got to change the major parts of them [voting laws] so that we at least have a shot at winning.” Yes, Alice, that would be a good idea. Or maybe you can actually get a pulse on the needs of the American electorate. 
Whether a democracy that ignores the many to cater to the few can long be sustained remains to be seen. Republicans are waiting to find out.

“Masters of the Currents: A Conversation with the Creators and Cast” brought together webinar attendees across the country and around the world April 7 to celebrate the first nationally touring play about Micronesians in the United States. 
The event, brought to Zoom by Visions and Voices and Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, foregrounded an often overlooked community: Micronesians. Micronesia is a subregion of Oceania comprised of hundreds of islands across the Pacific Ocean. Speakers included the creators and cast of “Masters of the Currents,” many of whom hail from these islands in Micronesia. 
To start off the discussion, moderator Marie-Reine Velez, Visions and Voices production and marketing specialist and co-founder of the Asian American theatre collective Artists at Play, introduced the co-creators of “Masters of the Currents:” award-winning performance artist, actor, playwright, director and cultural worker Leilani Chan and USC alum, actor and writer Ova Saopeng, who also starred in the play. 
The co-creators began by introducing TeAda Productions, where Chan works as artistic director and Saopeng works as associate producer and teaching artist. TeAda Productions, the home of “Masters of the Currents,” is a nomadic theatre of color based in Los Angeles. 
Chan described their focus as “working with communities to stage their stories.” She continued by highlighting their commitment to “working with underserved communities or communities that are not appearing in the mainstream or on the main stage of American theatre.”
“Masters of the Currents,” which chronicles the experiences of three Micronesian youth trying to understand their identities after seeking refuge in Hawai’i due to environmental and economic factors, allowed Hawai’i-raised Chan and Saopeng to return home and give back to their community. Saopeng cited their encounters with the new wave of immigrants and refugees as inspiration for the production. 
The co-creators maintained authenticity by centering Micronesians in their research and their ultimate portrayal of their experience. Four of the five cast members are from the islands of Micronesia, and Innocenta Sound-Kikku, a cast member who Saopeng fondly refers to as their “cultural navigator,” ensured that the elders were okay with Chan and Saopeng collecting stories from the community for the play. 
Attendees were able to catch a short eight minute recording of “Masters of the Currents.” Chana and Saopeng have held off holding virtual performances of their play due to Zoom constraints that prevent audience interaction integral to the production. 
Following the showing of the play excerpt, the remaining four cast members entered the discussion. Two shared similar anecdotes about joining the cast almost accidentally through the workshops Chan and Saopeng hosted with TeAda Productions.
Cast member Emeraldrose Hadik explained that she thought the workshop would just be listening to other people tell stories until Chan and Saopeng pulled a one-eighty on her and told the group that they would be the ones performing the stories instead.  
Jayceleen Ifenuk, another cast member, describes a nearly identical experience. After receiving an invitation to a workshop from Sound-Kikku, she thought she would be listening to others tell stories and was wholly surprised when they expected her to perform. As someone who avoided drama club in her high school years, Sound-Kikku said being up on stage was particularly jarring and awkward for her. In spite of her initial hesitancy when it came to stage performance, she found the experience to be healing. 
The cast shared their own difficulties with their Micronesian identity during the webinar and how the play helped the cast members and young viewers of the play embrace their heritage and culture. 
“As a Micronesian growing up in Hawai’i, I went through a lot. So sharing about personal experiences and what our community goes through in a creative way takes away the negativities of it,” said Ifenuk of the play.
Jermine Kaipat expressed his own evolution, describing his initial hesitancy to embrace his Micronesian identity prior to his involvement with “Masters of the Currents.” That evolved into a pride in his heritage after meeting everyone involved in the production. 
Ifenuk provided an anecdote about the aftermath of the play where the children who attended the youth center she worked at would proudly wear their cultural skirts combs which had often been a point of shame, teasing and embarrassment for Micronesian youth in Hawai’i. 
Sound-Kikku emphasized how amazing it was for viewers of the play to see themselves represented and how the play mobilized youth to stand up for Micronesians. 
“Now they advocate for us and stand up and say that’s not right,” Sound-Kikku said.  
Hadik also recounted a performance where several young children came up to her after the fact, grateful she was representing them. 
“Even before then, I believed in representation. But since then, since that interaction I’ve had with those kids, representation is all I ever do,” Hadik said. 
Chan brought attention to real-world issues facing Micronesians during the webinar, making the conversation particularly poignant by addressing the unjust murder of Micronesian teen Iremamber Sykap in Hawai’i by the police on April 6. 
Chan continued on to thank the audience and cast for participating in the webinar, “I am so appreciative of [you all] being here because we are so excited to have this platform to talk about [this work] because it definitely relates to how Micronesians are portrayed in the media and what they are facing in regards to racial profiling and other discrimination in Hawai’i.”

Since the rise of the internet and technology, gone are the nostalgic days of over-the-ear headphones, Walkmans, portable radios, MP3 and CD players. With new social media platforms booming, changing the game of viral music marketing and creating overnight successes, there are so many more ways of accessing and discovering music than ever before.
Though methods of music discovery have shifted from generation to generation, technology in its different forms, especially within the 20th and 21st centuries, has always had an influence on our consumption and music listening habits. 
Before, when people wanted to hear new songs or artists, they’d turn to their favorite radio stations and wait to hear the latest releases. 
Enter the digital era and streaming revolution. Now, with such a wide catalog of music constantly at our disposal, the advancement of technology has made it possible to tune in anywhere at any time. 
Nonetheless, the radio is still a stable player in the music industry today, but with innovative streaming platforms on the rise, physical sales and digital downloads have been on the decline. Whether you’re an audiophile or not, you don’t have to leave the house to buy music anymore. Music these days has become a lot easier to discover, stream and play. 
In 2018 alone, 75% of the recorded music industry’s revenue came from music streaming. 
As today’s most dominant form of music listening and discovery, streaming has allowed people to listen to more music than ever before, and it’s now become easier for smaller artists to be heard. 
The average American music listener in 2019 spent nearly 27 hours each week listening to music on different devices — ample time to come across budding artists. 
For me, much of those hours of music listening and discovering have been spent running NPR’s Tiny Desk concerts through my speakers all day. They give you the live concert experience from the comfort of your home without the noise of the crowd. Although, I will say, after over a year of not attending live shows, sometimes that sort of energy from a crowd is exactly what I look forward to post-pandemic. 
For others, they may find new sounds by surfing through hours of niche playlists, reading reviews, watching music critics such as Anthony Fantano (The Needle Drop) on YouTube or picking up a few record recommendations at their local store from a close friend or family member. 
Whether you’re an active or passive seeker of new music, the options are endless. 
Each day, anywhere between 20,000 to 24,000 songs are uploaded to different music streaming platforms. In six weeks, that number nears one million tracks. These songs are not only composed of pop star icons but indie, unsigned artists and small musicians trying to break through the crowded audio storm infiltrating our feeds and vying for our attention. 
In a close race behind streaming services for music discovery is social media — the new machine for launching artists to superstardom. 
Scroll through your Twitter feed, and you’re bound to discover something music-related. 
Unsurprisingly, according to MusicWatch, nine out of 10 social media users participate in music or artist-related activity through social applications. 
TikTok, for example, has propelled the careers of Lil Nas X and Sueco the Child. SoundCloud launched the careers of Halsey and Post Malone. YouTube catapulted Alessia Cara and Tori Kelly’s careers — this list could end up being a whole page if I were to continue. 
Clearly, music is a powerful force that drives our daily lives and interactions on social media. It’s all around us. It’s not hard to hear a song you’ve never heard before while walking through a grocery store or getting your hair done. But finding a song you love may take a little extra digging.  
Even when you’re not explicitly looking to discover music, it finds a way. Emily Sagen is a senior writing about music’s lasting impact. She is also an arts & entertainment editor at the Daily Trojan. Her column, “The Beat Lives On,” runs every other Friday.

“The Nevers” was advertised as Joss Whedon’s triumphant return to television. After working collaboratively on high-profile projects such as “The Avengers” this was supposed to be Whedon’s time to shine. However, accusations have risen recently about his abusive behavior on the set of “Buffy: The Vampire Slayer.” And, unfortunately, even though Whedon left the show in November 2020, “The Nevers” will premiere Sunday under a dark cloud of skepticism and hatred for the show’s creator.  
It is a shame that Whedon’s awful behavior is already overshadowing a fantastic show because the first four episodes of “The Nevers” are a joy to watch. 
“The Nevers” combines the feminist magic of “Buffy: The Vampire Slayer” with the sci-fi fun of “X-Men.” It is a typical sci-fi show but set in 1899 London, which somehow makes it so much better. After all, who doesn’t love to see Victorian women gain superpowers and fight bad guys? 
“The Nevers” follows “the touched,” a group of individuals (mainly women) who received unique superpowers after a mysterious orb floated over London in 1896. The concept is a little strange, but once you suspend your disbelief, it gets better. 
Our main protagonists, Ms. Amalia True (Laura Donnelly) and Miss Penance Adair (Ann Skelly) run an orphanage for the touched, a place described as a haven for the unique. The pilot episode begins with the pair fighting bad guys and recruiting a new touched girl to come live at their orphanage. It’s a fun introduction to the show and the perfect way to meet two characters whose dynamic is impossible not to love. 
The show shifts from a badass introduction and quickly establishes why the orphanage is necessary. In the three years since the orb appeared, the touched have become ostracized from society and are being hunted down. Their powers or “turns” are incomprehensible to society who views them as satanic and evil. 
The touched are despised by a bitter old men’s club who loathe the fact that “[the orb] came at us through our women” and “not one man of stature was affected.” Watching old men acting resentful and villainizing something that excludes them is the most realistic part of this sci-fi show. 
The anti-modernity and sexist elite class of London is not the only villain. There is also a radicalized faction of the touched, led by Maladie (Amy Manson), responsible for countless murders and disappearances across the city. There are hints of a more horrific villain than Maladie and angry old men, but nothing fleshed out within the first episodes. 
The four episodes consist of super sleuthing, action-packed battles, and wholesome moments of friendship. A collection of nuanced, interesting and well-dressed characters keep this tale engaging. “The Nevers” is chock full of different and intriguing storylines, an enjoyable creative choice that keeps the story moving at a rapid pace and does not allow anyone to get bored. 
“The Nevers” is special because it not only features an intriguing plot and excellent protagonists but also does an outstanding job of creating a fictional 1899 London. The series is set in a beautifully romanticized depiction of the Victorian era. Clothing choices are modernized in a way that would anger any historian yet seem fashionable, old-timey and chic to everyone else. The magnificent production enhances the action-packed script and heightens the overall quality of the show.  
For better or for worse, Joss Whedon’s mark on this show is very apparent. Amalia True is “The Nevers”’s Buffy, a stubborn protagonist who feels the weight of the world on her shoulders, while Penance Adair is Xander, Buffy’s optimistic and loyal best friend. Our heroes embody Whedon’s favorite television character tropes. 
Donnelly and Skelly fill these roles shockingly well and surprisingly naturally. They match the charisma and charm of well-known Whedon characters from “Buffy: The Vampire Slayer” and are worthy of filling Buffy and Xander’s shoes.
Unfortunately, “The Nevers” incorporates more than just Whedon’s favorite character archetypes, opting to also include fetishizations of female homoeroticism, one of his favorite elements to add to his shows. In a show where almost all female characters receive male love interests, there is a shocking amount of implied homosexual attraction between the women. 
Whedon forces longing gazes and romantic moments between the female protagonists. Although Amalia True and Penance Adair appear romantically interested in each other, spoiler, they are not. Their on-screen chemistry is incredible, and instead of stopping it at friendship, Whedon takes their dynamic a step further, queer baiting the audience. Whedon has Amalia openly declare that she “fucks men” but then gets our hopes up by having her and Penance romantically gaze at one another.  
Although there is a polyamorous pansexual sex club in “The Nevers,” which adds an important theme of sexual freedom to the show, Whedon’s sexualization of female friendships is queerbaiting and very unnecessary. Whedon’s fetishization of lesbianism is the worst part of this show. 
Flaws included, “The Nevers” is phenomenal. And even though “The Nevers” has a Joss Whedon problem, it’s a spectacular show that everyone needs to watch.   
The first four episodes of “The Nevers” will be released on HBO Sunday.
Review: 4.5/5

After a 1-2 road series loss against Cal last weekend, USC will host Dixie State at Dedeaux Field for a three-game series this weekend. The Trojans now have a 12-11 overall record and a 5-4 conference record. 
This will be the first-ever meeting between the Trojans and the Trailblazers. After competing at the Division II level for 14 years, this is the first season DSU is competing at the Division I level in the Western Athletic Conference. So far they have struggled in their first year and enter the series with an 9-17 overall record. 
Although the Trailblazers may be new to the conference, the Trojans are still going into this series with the same competitive attitude they strive to bring for any opponent. 
“We’re not going to take anything light about it,” redshirt junior left hand pitcher Isaac Esqueda said. “We’ve been keeping up with their record and seeing how they perform against other teams. We’re just gonna go out there and play another three game series and keep doing what we are doing.” 
USC won their first game of the series against Cal last Thursday 6-1 with a strong performance and career-high 8 innings pitched by Esqueda. The pitcher leads the USC rotation with a 2.27 earned run average this year. The Trojans have won all of his last four starts, and he leads the Trojans with 41 strikeouts in 43.2 innings. 
Esqueda will likely start Friday. 
“I’m not trying to change anything or do too much going into this week,” Esqueda said. “I mean it’s just another game that I have to perform and I feel like I’ve been putting in the work and it’s been paying off a lot. ”
USC struggled offensively for the rest of their series against Cal, losing 3-4 Friday and 1-5 Saturday. Despite the losses, the Trojans still feel confident in their ability to win. 
“It’s just part of the game where people get base hits and we’ve been playing defense well and we’ve been hitting the ball pretty well so I feel like it’s just executing when we have guys in scoring position,” Esqueda said. “But other than that I feel like we’re in a good position because it’s been close ball games every time so I feel like we need to just keep doing what we’re doing and it will pay off.”
Redshirt junior infielder Ben Ramirez and redshirt junior infielder Jamal O’Guinn have led the Trojans’ offense in the past few weeks. O’Guinn leads the team’s scorecard with five home runs, 20 RBI and 18 walks. Ramirez follows close behind with 4 homers and 15 RBI.
“Hitting and pitching both have been doing pretty well,” Esqueda said. “Hitting has helped us a lot even with our pitchers keeping the ballgame pretty close so our hitters are able to come up and score a few runs to have us win the game or take the lead early.” 
First pitch against Dixie State is Friday at 6 p.m.

USC women’s lacrosse will take on San Diego State this weekend in their first home game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 2017. The Trojans hold a 7-4 record while the Aztecs are 3-6 on the season. 
Coming off a road trip where the Trojans lost to Colorado and defeated Oregon, USC plans to take care of a struggling Aztec team that has lost four of their last five games.
The Trojans aim to repeat their season-opening performance where they dominated the Aztecs 20-6, outscoring them 12-1 in the second half. Although they handled business easily in their first meeting, USC cannot afford to take SDSU lightly. The Aztecs have gone 3-2 against Pac-12 opponents since that season-opening loss. 
Head coach Lindsey Munday discussed what she wants to see from her team as they inch closer to the postseason.
“I think right now the biggest thing for us is the small details, the non-stat sheet plays,” Munday said. “We are really focusing on the details, discipline across the board, especially defensively with fouls and not giving up 8-meter opportunities. Offensively, it’s making sure we don’t have unforced turnovers and just focusing on the basics of everything and not getting complacent with them.”
On the offensive side, senior midfielder Kelsey Huff continues to be one of the key contributors for the Trojans. Against Oregon on Sunday she recorded her fourth hat trick of the season, upping her goal total to 20 on the season. The 2019 First Team All Pac-12 player has scored over 100 goals in her collegiate career so far. 
Huff described how coronavirus regulations have changed the team’s dynamics.
“This is one of the closest teams I’ve ever been on in my entire life,” Huff said. “So for us having to separate and not being able to see each other when our houses are across the street it stinks only being able to wave from our porches instead of actually spending time together.” 
Huff also looks forward to the opportunity to play at the Coliseum, a venue the Trojans haven’t been able to play at for four years due to major renovations. 
“Being in the Coliseum is going to be an awesome opportunity,” Huff said. “I can’t even imagine the feeling we are going to get when we walk onto that field, so a lot of us are pretty excited about that.” 
The last time the Trojans played at the historic Coliseum was April 14, 2017 when they beat Colorado 11-5.
Currently sitting behind Stanford in the Pac-12 standings with three conference games left on their schedule, the Trojans look to make a push for the regular-season title and continue their strong play heading into the conference tournament.
The Trojans will take on the Aztecs at noon Friday.
