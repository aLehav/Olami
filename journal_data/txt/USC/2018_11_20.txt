Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan
When President Daniel Ortega announced the changes to social security in Nicaragua, Lesther Alemán was one of the students protesting. He fled as police pelted them with rocks and threw tear gas directly at bodies in the crowd.
“We were walking with people in suits and ties and women wearing heels that were leaving work,” Alemán told the Daily Trojan in an interview in Spanish. “[It was] near 6 p.m. when we left running. In the meantime, my university was being attacked.”
Jeancarlo López said the way he viewed violence changed when he watched a friend die in a following protest.
“That changes your view completely, which is to fight in truth and justice, fight for separation of state powers where the weight and counterweight of the power is clear and isn’t corrupt by a system in which … the judicial power is not different from executive power,” López said in an interview in Spanish.
Now, seven months later, no one in Nicaragua can bear the country’s flag without being a considered a terrorist, Alemán told the crowd of nearly 70 students and community members gathered in Taper Hall Monday. 
Police see white and blue balloons or red lipstick as a threat, López said.
Alemán and López, both student activists from Nicaragua, spoke at the Nicaragüense Student Panel put together by USC’s Latinx Student Association and Central American Network, Nicas por La Democracia, Nicaragua Libre Los Angeles and two Nicaraguan university activism organizations to discuss the crisis the country has been undergoing.
Nicaragua broke out in turmoil in April as police responded violently to student protests regarding the simultaneous cut in social security benefits and hike in social security taxes by Ortega. 
By the end of April, 30 students were killed according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Since then, the government and much of Nicaragua’s public has clashed, causing the public to denounce Ortega’s decisions as a violation of human rights and called for him to step down. 
“We don’t believe in war, we want peace for Nicaragua, we want space for democracy where there is liberty,” Alemán said. “[Ortega] says he is doing what is right, that he can continue to do the right thing, but it’s not like that. I know that’s why we have asked for a change in government and a change in the system.”
In May, Alemán interrupted a discussion at a national dialogue round table to denounce Ortega for causing the violence in Nicaragua and to assert that they were not there for dialogue, but to negotiate his step down from presidency. 
Since then, he and López have had to be more wary of their safety, as have many young people in the country.
“If we arrived tomorrow at our university, immediately the police would be deployed to capture us and, if they didn’t capture us, they would kill us,” Alemán said in the interview. 
López said that though the short-term goal is for Ortega to step down from presidency, Nicaragua needs to ensure that they prevent future dictatorship and do not allow the cycle to repeat.
“[It’s important] to not forget, to not let the memory of the Nicaraguans stay only in that time,” López said. “We always have to remember what happened. For those people who died looking for that freedom, we have to keep looking.”
Both of the students agreed that the crisis was bigger than many realized and said it was important to actively bring visibility to the issue because the country is small in comparison to others like Venezuela and Syria undergoing conflict. 
“What we want students to know is the dimension of the crisis in Nicaragua,” Alemán said in an interview. “If Nicaragua is not well off then the continent will not be well off … because there is no question that this is affecting all the countries”
Anaís Gonzalez, a Nicaraguan activist in Los Angeles who helped arrange the event, said that she became involved with the intention of creating more conversation around the crisis.
“Number one thing that we want to push for is to create that visibility,” she said. “[Nicaragua] was one of the safest countries, was one of the countries that was able to throw over a dictatorship in 1979. We’re trying to do it again.”
In regard to the crisis and the event, CAN said it supports such visibility.
“The Central American Network is committed to providing spaces to encourage dialogues on issues regarding central American social realities,” the organization said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.

The annual Teen Vogue Summit comes to Los Angeles next week. Last year’s inaugural Summit attracted more than 500 people. (Photo courtesy of Andrew Noel)
Decadent food trucks, a speaker event with Serena Williams and a Google-powered coding session  are just a few of the many attractions presented at the second annual Teen Vogue Summit based in Los Angeles. The event is part of a series of innovative changes spearheaded by the publication to reach its millennial and Gen Z fanbase in refreshing and dynamic  ways. 
Last November, Condé Nast announced that Teen Vogue would be ending its 14-year print run, a sentimental blow to millenials who grew up on the magazine’s  fashion trends and social commentary pieces. 
But all was not lost for the publication, whose new consumer base has evolved, socially and politically. During the 2016 election season, Teen Vogue became a leader in political coverage aimed at the digital generation, covering topics like “gaslighting” and reproductive rights with unprecedented success, under the direction of the publication’s former editor-in-chief Elaine Welteroth. 
“Teen Vogue has as much right to be at the table, talking about politics, as every young woman does in America right now,’’ Welteroth said, in an interview on The Daily Show.
The Summit premiered last December in Los Angeles and made its New York debut the following June. This year’s Los Angeles event begins Friday, Nov. 30, with a series of skill-building workshops called “Career Immersions.” The following day is the Summit itself, featuring an extensive lineup of speakers and activities, including 11-year-old activist Naomi Wadler and a panel discussion titled “Queer in Hollywood.” 
In an email interview with the Daily Trojan, Teen Vogue Executive Editor Samhita Mukhopadhyay spoke about the Summit and what attendees can expect. 
Daily Trojan: What do you think college students can gain from the Summit?
Samhita Mukhopadhyay: The Career Immersions on Friday are great for college students. They will get to meet with experts and people working at many different companies. Also, many of the keynotes are about how people got to where they are and advice on their industries (and general life advice), so I think that is great. But what is probably most important is the relationship building. Leaving college is a tough and confusing time, and having a network of friends to advise you or just listen or share with you the experience is invaluable. 
D.T.: What inspired the inaugural Teen Vogue Summit last year? How does the Summit represent the changes that the publication has undergone in the past few years?
S.M.: We realized we had a deeply engaged audience that wanted more than just online engagement and saw a critical opportunity to move offline. Despite the fast-paced, “how many likes do you have” nature of social media, young people are craving offline experiences. We also wanted to give our readers the chance to meet our editors, the celebrities we cover and the activists they care about. 
D.T.: How did Teen Vogue choose the keynote speaker (Serena Williams) for this year’s Summit?
S.M.: One of the biggest news stories of the year was what happened when Serena was fouled at the US Open. Young women watched that, and it was confusing and hard to see both someone they look up to experience something so unjust and also send the message that it doesn’t matter how far you get, gender discrimination will still be an issue. Serena’s words and then her affirmations for Naomi Osaka were so powerful [that] we just had to have her come and speak at the Summit.
D.T.: Who/what are you most excited for attendees to see at the Summit this year?
S.M.: Serena! Also, Lana Condor, Storm Reid, Vanessa Morgan, Josie Totah, and honestly, I’m excited about everything. They are all so special in their own way.  
D.T.: Who is someone you wish could speak at the Summit this year?
S.M.: Michelle Obama and Oprah.  I hope they see this — it’s not too late!
The two-day Teen Vogue Summit comes to Los Angeles on Nov. 30. Tickets range from $199 to $499. USC students can receive a 50 percent discount on tickets by using the code USC50 at checkout.

Redshirt junior guard Derryck Thornton dribbles down the court against Robert Morris on Nov. 6 at Galen Center. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The story of USC men’s basketball team’s early season has been filled with first half struggles followed by impressive second frame performances. But it was the last 20 minutes that let the Trojans down in a 78-63 loss to Texas Tech in the semifinals of the NABC Hall of Fame Classic in Kansas City, Missouri on Nov. 19. 
The Trojan defense fell to pieces, allowing 55 second half points as Texas Tech shot 84 percent. 
“We played a pretty good first half, we played very good defense, we shared the ball,” head coach Andy Enfield said to the Associated Press. “They did a great job of making open shots and they made some tough shots in the second half.”
USC hurt itself with five fouls and three turnovers in the first four minutes of the half. The Red Raiders took advantage by going on a 14-4 run to take their first lead since 2-0. The offenses traded blows from there until the Red Raiders took command with a 12-1 run to take a 64-53 lead with four and a half minutes left. From there Texas Tech coasted to the victory.
“I didn’t do a good job of coming out and helping the guys have energy in the second half,” senior guard Bennie Boatwright said to the Orange County Register. “We came out flat. They came out and made a run, and we didn’t do anything about it.”
The Trojans’ lack of discipline was a big problem – they committed 17 personal fouls in the second half, and Texas Tech made 18 of their 24 second half free throws. 
“It was frustrating, because we couldn’t get the fouls ourselves,”  Enfield said to the Associated Press.
USC also had 17 turnovers in the game, giving Texas Tech easy scoring opportunities in transition.
But USC’s first half defense was stifling, allowing just 23 points in the frame. The Red Raiders struggled from the field, with a 27.3 percent mark on field goals, including 11.1 percent from deep. The Trojans were everywhere, contesting shots and forcing seven turnovers in the half.
The numbers would have been even better if it weren’t for a flagrant foul and a technical foul called against junior forward Nick Rakocevic. The flagrant came when Rakocevic hit redshirt senior center Norense Odiase in the face while posting up. Although it appeared to be incidental, the referees ruled it flagrant because Rakocevic extended his arm.
The technical came minutes later, when Rakocevic barked at a referee for a foul call after an attempt at the basket. Texas Tech made free throws as a result of these plays.
USC’s offense wasn’t fantastic, especially in the second half, but it wasn’t the problem aside from the turnovers. The bright spot was that the Trojans shot almost 41 percent from three, making nine of 22 attempts. 
Their issues came inside the arc, despite a strong outside shooting effort. USC shot 44.2 percent from the field for the game and got to the line 12 times. The offense, which came into the game averaging over 85 points per game, will need to be better if the Trojans continue to underperform defensively.
“We’re going to learn from it, and tomorrow we just have to execute,” Boatwright said.
Freshman guard Kevin Porter led USC with 15 points, followed by Boatwright’s 14 points that earned his membership into the 1,000 point club on a three-pointer with four minutes left in the first half. 
The Trojans take on Missouri State at 4 p.m. Tuesday in the consolation round.

Sophomore driver Jacob Mercep takes a shot against UCLA at Uytengsu Aquatic Center on Sunday. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
After entering the weekend’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championship as the No. 2 seed, the top-ranked USC men’s water polo team suffered a 10-9 comeback defeat to No. 4 Cal before falling to No. 2 UCLA 7-4 in the third-place match. The Trojans finished their season with a 28-3 record. 
Given their poor MPSF tournament finish, the Trojans were uncertain if they would advance to the NCAA Championships in December. But, on Sunday evening, it was announced that the Trojans earned an at-large berth in the tournament, advancing along with UCLA and Stanford. Their next match will be on Dec. 1 against the winner of an opening round game.
As a top-two seed, USC had a first round bye in the tournament. Cal dominated its first match on Friday, putting up 27 goals against Austin College. Coming in as the fourth-ranked team in the NCAA, Cal needed a victory against USC Saturday to have a chance at one of the MPSF’s three NCAA tournament spots.
Saturday’s showdown began with Cal answering each of USC’s four early finishes. Freshman driver Hannes Daube, who was recently named the MPSF Newcomer of the Year, put up 2 goals to lead the Trojans’ first quarter attack.
The Trojans extended their lead to 2 goals by halftime. Both teams hit the post several times, keeping the game tight. Once again, Cal answered each Trojan strike to remain within 2 entering the final frame.
Cal dominated the fourth quarter from the start, scoring within the first minute and then tying the game up a couple of minutes later. A series of missed shots by both teams locked the score at 9-9 until Cal broke the silence with six seconds left on the clock.
Saturday’s loss to Cal snapped an 11-game winning streak for the Trojans and marked their first home loss this season. In their previous meeting two weeks before, the Trojans defeated the Bears 13-7.
“We thought we were just going to take off in the third and fourth quarter,” sophomore driver Jacob Mercep said. “It seemed that physically we were kind of down, which we didn’t expect.”
Cal came into the tournament as an underdog, but its win carried major implications for the Trojans’ NCAA playoff bid, heightening the stakes for Sunday’s third-place game against UCLA.
“If we don’t win [against UCLA], then we’re kind of on the edge,” Mercep said before the game. “Shall we, or shall we not go to NCAAs?” 
Unlike the early shootout of Saturday’s match, Sunday’s clash highlighted the defensive efforts of both teams early on. UCLA’s redshirt junior goalie Alex Wolf, an All-MPSF First Team selection, had six saves in the first period to rob the Trojans of early opportunities. Freshman goalie Nic Porter, the MPSF leader in goals allowed per game, had three saves of his own to contribute to a first quarter shutout.
Mercep delivered a blast to put the Trojans on the board in the fifth minute, but UCLA responded with a 3-goal surge at the outset of the second frame. Sophomore attacker Chasen Travisano scored 2 goals for the Bruins, allowing UCLA to gain momentum.
However, UCLA’s offense was not finished, adding 2 more goals to finish the half with a 5-2 advantage. Despite this margin, the Trojans were confident that they were still in the game.
“[We discussed] just keeping calm and playing our game,” junior 2-meter Matt Maier said. “The game was definitely not over. It was far from over.”
Although the Trojan defense was solid in the second half, allowing just 2 scores, their offensedid little to close the gap. The result was a 7-4 victory for the Bruins. 
Despite leading the MPSF with an average 16.3 goals scored per game, the Trojans were held to just 4 goals in Sunday’s match. While USC took 29 shots to UCLA’s 28, its offense struggled to finish as it faced UCLA’s seasoned keeper in Wolf.
“We just didn’t play up to the standards we set for ourselves,” Maier said. “We’ll work on that for sure and get better at it.”

Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman tries to escape a tackle against UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Nov. 17. (Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan)
The Trojans’ season is all but over after dropping to a 5-6 record following their defeat at the Rose Bowl to UCLA Saturday. The only avenue left to a .500 record and a potential bowl berth is a victory against Notre Dame Saturday at the Coliseum, a prospect that seems about as unlikely as Alabama head coach Nick Saban being announced the Trojans’ new coach. 
Notre Dame will roll into the Coliseum with an undefeated record, after steamrolling previously No. 12-ranked Syracuse 36-3. The Fighting Irish are better than the Trojans in every phase of the game, which makes it hard to see USC walking out of the Coliseum with a win Saturday. 
A win, however, would regain a bowl berth seemingly out of thin air and bring back some of the enthusiasm that’s been leaking out of the program all year. It’s not something to bet on, but at least something the Trojan faithful can hope for.
USC offense vs. Notre Dame defense
The Trojan passing game can only go so far as freshman quarterback JT Daniels can take it, and that’s far from comforting. Daniels has hardly evolved from the player he was at the start of the season — he makes the same mistakes he made back in September with regularity, failing to progress through reads or make good decisions and often finding himself unable to get the right amount of force behind his throws. 
However, the good is still there -— Daniels shows tremendous accuracy at times as well as a gunslinger mentality that’s hard to come by, but his inconsistency makes it impossible to trust an offense under his leadership.
Last week, he got off to a blistering start, putting throw after throw on the money before tossing a bad interception straight to a UCLA cornerback after failing to make any reads on the coverage. 
Plays such as that kill the flow of the offense, demoralize the defense and can turn the tide of a football game, as they have so many times this year for the Trojans. Daniels has capable weapons in the passing game in players like wide receivers junior Michael Pittman and freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown, who have steadily performed at high levels when given the opportunity. 
Pittman was excellent in his return from a shoulder injury that caused him to miss the previous game, catching seven balls for 106 yards, as was St. Brown with his six receptions, 98 yards and score on the day. 
Daniels might have a tough time getting the ball to them, however; Notre Dame features what’s likely the most imposing secondary the Trojans have seen all year. 
Cornerbacks Julian Love and Troy Pride Jr. have been a thorn in the side of opposing quarterbacks all season, with a combined 23 pass defenses and three interceptions. Safeties Drue Tranquil and  Jalen Elliott are both physical enforcers on the back end, combining for 125 tackles so far. Elliott has been fantastic in coverage as well, with six passes defensed and a team-leading four interceptions (more than the whole USC defense). 
If the Trojans want to make this game a close one, it will likely take a lot from the running game. USC has been good at running the ball of late — running backs senior Aca’Cedric Ware and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai are both averaging around five yards a carry in the last three weeks. 
The issue has been the lack of volume in the run game, a mistake that likely cost them a win against UCLA, as the running backs only carried the ball 21 times against one of the country’s worst rush defenses. Though the Irish aren’t a poor run defending team by any means, they aren’t as strong stopping the run as they are in pass defense. Against Syracuse last week, they gave up 186 yards on 29 carries — USC would be more than happy to find that kind of success.  Defensive linemen Jerry Tillery and linebacker Te’von Coney won’t make it an easy task, but if the Trojans want to get anything going on offense, they must find a way to establish the ground game.
Notre Dame offense vs. USC defense
The Notre Dame offense has run like a well-oiled machine all year long, leaning on a balanced attack that averages 257.7 pass yards and 197.2 rush yards per game. 
Quarterback Ian Book has been tremendous for the Fighting Irish, completing 72.6 percent of his passes at a rate of 8.8 yards per attempt to go with 17 touchdowns and only five interceptions. His top two options in the receiving game, wide receivers  Miles Boykin and Chase Claypool, have been forces outside the numbers, with 1,288 receiving yards and 12 touchdowns between them. 
Boykin and Claypool are perhaps the most physically imposing receiver duo in college football, as both stand at 6-foot-4 and over 225 pounds. They could be a matchup nightmare for the Trojans, who won’t have a cornerback over 6-foot-1 in for the game. 
The USC secondary has been inconsistent at best against the pass all year. It has been routinely shredded by teams with even a decent passing offense — even Oregon State threw for 301 yards against them. Defending the run will be no easy task either, as Notre Dame’s running back committee has rushed for 1,598 yards on an astounding yards per carry average of 5.8. 
The unit is led by Dexter Williams, who has racked up 11 rushing touchdowns to go with his 844 yards on the ground, with  Tony Jones and Jafar Armstrong rotating in. 
If last week was any indication, the Trojans aren’t in any position to slow them down very much come Saturday. They allowed UCLA running back Joshua Kelley to gash them all day long last Saturday, resulting in 289 ground yards and two touchdowns for the redshirt  junior. 
Though the Trojans had been stout against the run the previous two weeks, they’ve allowed for huge games on the ground by multiple running backs throughout the season, such as Arizona State’s Eno Benjamin or  Utah’s Zack Moss. It’s hard to see a way for the Trojans to slow down the Notre Dame offense — they’re too well rounded and USC is simply too flawed on that side of the ball.
Prediction: 52-14, Notre Dame
The gap between these two teams is far worse than it was last year, when the Irish beat the Trojans 49-14. This Notre Dame squad will likely make the College Football Playoff, while USC will probably fail to make a bowl game for the first time in nearly two decades. 
On either side of the ball, it’s tough to see the Trojans making a dent against the Irish in this matchup. Although there’s much of an avenue for the Trojans to flip the expected result, expect the seniors to play at a higher level than we’ve seen all year  in what’s likely their final game in a Trojan uniform. That might make this game a bit more exciting than the expected blowout.

USC lost to UCLA 34-27 this past Saturday at the Rose Bowl in one of USC’s worst defeats, capping off one of USC’s worst seasons in a long time. 
But the Trojans’ downfall on Saturday was not the most important event of the week.
Two weeks ago, a gunman killed 12 people in a bar in Thousand Oaks. This past week, the Woolsey and Camp Fires have left over 80 people dead, hundreds of thousands of acres scorched and millions of lives affected. 
So before we have conversations about how sad we are that USC will most likely go 5-7 this season, let’s first step back and realize how lucky we are to even be able to witness what we did on Saturday -— win or lose.
I assure you: I’m not trying to call USC fans spoiled.
The USC-UCLA game on Saturday was my last football game as an undergraduate student. To say that the loss left me heartbroken would be an understatement. Feeling the crushing defeat when the team had so many opportunities to put it away and come out with a win was nothing short of depressing. 
But I would be lying if I said that loss was the most important thing or should be the most important thing on my mind. There is life outside of football. 
Obviously, the potential expensive buyout of head coach Clay Helton will not be a fun endeavor for Athletic Director Lynn Swann and this administration. And freshman quarterback JT Daniels has some questions surrounding his decision-making skills going into the final week of the season against Notre Dame. And obviously, it’s not fun to watch USC lose game after game and have no accountability for a program that has been historically excellent. 
But during this week of giving thanks, I implore you to be thankful for the past and present. The USC area is safe. We get to breathe clean air and attend a school that isn’t being threatened by fire. The football team’s record should not define our time at USC. 
I do apologize to the die-hard USC fans, boosters and alumni who go to every game, wake up every Saturday morning at the crack of dawn to tailgate and watch this team. This season was admittedly tough, but a real fan watches the team and supports it no matter what. 
Next month, I’ll be moving to Missoula, Montana. I will be living in a state with a quarter of the population of L.A. It’s a place where five-star recruits are as hard to find as a parking spot on Menlo Avenue. 
But you know what you can find a Montana with ease? You can find loyal fans who don’t care whether or not the Montana Grizzlies win a bowl game, whether or not they score 50 points on a Division II cupcake, who don’t care what has happened this season as long as the people who they care about are watching it next to them.
Continually, USC and Los Angeles fans are attacked by the national media for not being loyal enough. But this week, I’ve grown sick and tired of defending Trojan fans, especially when all fans can talk about is winning. 
Let’s be clear: I’m not here to defend Helton. Simply put, he cannot be defended, especially after the way this team has played in their past three games. 
What I am here to tell you is that our school is nicknamed the “University of Spoiled Children” for a reason: People simply cannot see the bigger picture.
So the question is: In a year when expectations have not been met, how is this student body going to respond? 
My time at USC is unfortunately up. But it’s not too late for you to be thankful.

Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth Debicki star in Steve McQueen’s “Widows,” a film about a group of women who promise to finish the heist their husbands died attempting. (Photo from IMDb)
Director Steve McQueen has faced heavy anticipation for his first film following the Academy Award-winner “12 Years a Slave.” On Friday, the British director and screenwriter released “Widows,” an empowering film that succeeds through strong cinematic value and an even stronger political statement.
With this movie, McQueen updates Lynda La Plante’s original miniseries for the modern era, setting the story in present day Chicago. After their husbands are killed during a failed robbery, four women (Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Erivo) take fate into their own hands and conspire to forge their own futures.
The irony behind the film’s success is that it is easily McQueen’s worst movie. Unlike his past films, “Widows” has the broadest mainstream appeal as a heist thriller. Still, the claim holds little water for the director,  as his past projects “Hunger,” “Shame” and “12 Years a Slave” are considered some of the best films of the past decade. While McQueen compromises some of his artistic integrity with the intent of creating a blockbuster, he still finds ways to make an otherwise formulaic movie engaging and exciting.
Unlike many popular Hollywood productions, “Widows” does not glamorize its protagonists. In preparation, Davis decided to pick a wig for her character, Veronica Rowlings, but McQueen opposed it, asking  Davis to use her natural hair instead.
There was also no calculated plan in casting the four leads. McQueen prioritized talent, which is best illustrated by his adamant decision to cast Rodriguez, despite others warning  him of her reputation.
With this mindset, McQueen assembled a diverse group of women who have an infectious dynamic, with Davis and Debicki putting up standout performances as Veronica and Alice, respectively.
McQueen also does not directly portray the protagonists as empowering, and instead places them in dire circumstances. In fact, when McQueen first offered Rodriguez to play Linda, she did not accept the role because the character reminded her too much of her own upbringing. By placing the central characters in these situations, however, McQueen allowed viewers to naturally empathize with them.
For Veronica, the death of her husband Harry (Liam Neeson) is the final blow to her mental well-being, after recently  losing her son to police brutality. Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) suffers from a history of domestic abuse from both her husband and mother, and Linda is a mother of two trying to manage her family’s business.
The leads’ circumstances are only part of the conflict, as the film’s deplorable male characters provide glimpses into the vileness and corruption of Chicago. Through Jack (Colin Farrell) and Tom Mulligan (Robert Duvall), McQueen illustrates economic segregation, political corruption and nepotism. Duvall delivers an unexpectedly frightening performance, highlighted by a heated and racially charged conversation with Farrell.
However, from the four leads’ perspective, the Mulligans only indirectly affect their situation, and they are instead confronted by Jamal (Brian Tyree Henry) and Jatemme Manning (Daniel Kaluuya). While Henry makes the audience sympathize with Jamal, Kaluuya tears down this sympathy as Jatemme.
A cold and calculated mobster may sound one-dimensional on paper; however, Kaluuya shows range and nuance, effectively times his actions and lines and creates one of the most terrifying film villains in recent years. When he interrogates the handicapped owner of a bowling alley about Harry, he is paralyzingly frightening as he casually and continuously stabs the man.
Of course, McQueen shines as a director. The mainstream appeal of “Widows” prevented him from showcasing his full potential, as the film never quite replicates extraordinary moments like the 17-minute shot in “Hunger.” Still, McQueen manages to pull off some defining scenes, such as filming Jack’s extensive car ride from empty storefronts to his million-dollar mansion in one continuous shot, with the camera swaying side to side.
The opening scene of the movie is simultaneously empowering and enthralling, as a passionate kiss between an interracial couple is intercut with a high-speed car chase. It is one of many instances when McQueen excels in timing and abruptly revealing information, as he waits until the audience grows accustomed to the act of love before bringing a sudden burst of action.
Despite creating a heist thriller, McQueen manages to deviate from the expected genre with the help of co-writer Gillian Flynn, the author of “Gone Girl.” The tone and dialogue-heavy scenes help elevate the film beyond simple escapism. The conversations feel genuine and sometimes let natural humor seep in.
Due to some shocking moments, McQueen and Flynn slowly build the story to the final, pulse-pounding heist. While this climax is short-lived, it is still fulfilling to see these women take full control of their lives after braving unfortunate circumstances for so long.
Even though it signals a noticeable departure from the rest of McQueen’s stellar filmography, “Widows” still succeeds. The film’s mass appeal, as a whole, allows some out-of-place moments and notable clichés to be scattered throughout without sacrificing its overall poignancy.

HBO’s adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s book “My Brilliant Friend,” director Saverio Costanzo enlisted actors near Naples, Italy, to ensure authenticity in casting. (Photo from IMDb)
There has always been a fascination surrounding the Neapolitan Novels. The series is an exemplar of intricate storytelling, recounting the friendship between two young girls, Lila Cerullo and Elena Greco, who live in a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples, Italy. Elena Ferrante’s books have gained a world-wide following, with critics praising their portrayal of friendship, life and womanhood. 
So earlier this year, when HBO announced a mini-series adaptation of the first book in the series “My Brilliant Friend,” fans were worried the project would flop. When HBO hired Italian director Saverio Costanzo, others were curious how he would interpret the complicated lifelong relationship between Lila and Elena and if he could accomplish the feat genuinely and authentically. The worry was put to rest Sunday night with the series premiere, and if the rest of the mini-series can follow suit, this cinematic adaptation is set to become an instant classic.  
The series begins with a phone call. Rino, Lila’s eldest son, calls in tears to tell Elena (also known as Lenù) that his mother is missing once again. Except this time, she has taken everything, even cutting herself out of family photographs. Lenù tells him it is pointless to look for her and that there is nothing she can do to help. She hangs up the phone and begins to think of Lila, her best friend with whom she shared a turbulent relationship. With tears rolling down her face, Lila opens her laptop and begins to recount their story.
The pilot episode is emotionally gripping and captivating from the start. In one of the most compelling scenes, it is revealed that young Lila — a small, disruptive child who sits near the back of the class — is intellectually superior to her peers in nearly all aspects of academia. Costanzo faithfully translated this scene from the book, yet it added something the novel lacked — honest moments of silence, with the audience’s eyes locked on Lila, watching her as she competes with the older boys at school. The scene arouses tension, as the audience is forced to watch Lila remain silent, despite knowing she has all the answers.
This is the allure of Lila’s character. Aside from Ludovica Nasti’s superb acting, her complexity and stark contrast to Lenù are captivating. No one knows why she “chooses” to remain silent; why she is so vocal against others, but silent toward herself; and why she is so intellectually bright, yet always remains physically in the dark. Lila herself does not know why. Her mystery is what scares her classmates, yet it is what fascinates Lenù and grips the audience.
The slow pace of the miniseries also follows the book’s pace, and, once again, Costanzo’s careful execution pays off. The slow timing and pacing allow the audience to fully engage in each moment.
From this, one can relish each defining moment of Lila and Lenù’s relationship — from the afternoon they first became acquaintances to the evening they first became friends. It enhances the solidarity between the two protagonists who as young girls have decided to take on their chaotic neighborhood together. It also allows the audience to fully grasp each emotion and the foreshadowed impact it will have on the girls, especially with the violence plaguing their neighborhood. Costanzo is careful with crafting and executing the first chapters of the novel in order to set a steady foundation for the rest of the series.
However, one of the series’ most impressive aspects is Costanzo’s recreation of the Neapolitan neighborhood setting. He was dedicated to recreating Naples in the 1950s, before the city’s urbanization and industrialization by hiring actors fluent in the Neapolitan dialect, because he had no intention of dubbing the series for English speakers and wanted the story to be told in its truest form. The neighborhood is one of the main characters in the story, and Costanzo knew that it needed to be as complex and carefully crafted as its inhabitants.
By all indications, “My Brilliant Friend” is shaping up to become a hit. If the rest of the series matches the technical and artistic achievements of the first episode, the entire Neapolitan Novel series adaptations have potential to become a story that people talk about for generations to come.

Yasmin Davis | Daily Trojan
Call me old-fashioned, but there’s nothing I love more than a real book. 
I relish the tactile experience of creasing the edges with my thumb, the sweet musk that lingers with every turn of the page, the annotations and scrawls that will come to decorate the margins, the weight and physicality of the characters and stories. 
Even in 2018, I can’t imagine reading an e-book, which lacks the spatial memory and gravitas of a print book you can grip and peruse. Not only do I own and collect more physical books than American Airlines will reasonably allow me to fly out from home, I’m a handwritten note-taker by choice and a devoted journaler. The only break I get from my antiquated ways is writing, editing and producing the Daily Trojan every night — and even then, I’m a forsaken slave to the print medium. 
Maybe I truly embody the platitude of being born in the wrong generation, or maybe I’m onto something here. They say print is dead, its eulogies delivered to the dispassionate masses. But there will always be something about its tangibility that’s worth cherishing and protecting. In a world of zeroes and ones, beeps and clicks, pop-ups and push notifications, print books hold a reassuring sincerity and simplicity that remind me of simpler times — when I read books in a moving car until I was dizzy, by the light of a flashlight under my blankets, on the swingset behind my neighbor’s house at dusk. 
I could be an idealist for what’s real — or just optimistic about the precedent set by the resurgence of vinyl records. I’m definitely far from a Gen-Z poster child for all things digital and capitalistic, but the power of print over branding and statement-making may in fact be growing as print objects increasingly feel more expressive compared to their two-dimensional alternatives. 
Artists have tapped into this technological countermovement for decades now by creating works called artist’s books — art objects that imitate or challenge the traditional book form. Out of a climate of social and political activism in the 1970s, artists came to regard books as democratic “alternative spaces” to display artwork. 
Notoriously frustrated poet-turned-artist Dieter Roth is largely credited as the founding father of the artist’s book, pioneering the idea that a book is an independent vessel for presenting art. By creating books like “Poemetrie” out of dissected plastic envelopes pressed with urine, Roth reinvented books by deciding that they don’t need binding or images or text or any semblance of order. Artist’s books separate books from the narratives they are expected to tell and become sites of struggle between the past and present. 
Each one tells a story through both content and design. Whether they take the form of codexes, collapsible boxes or gilded manuscripts, artist’s books are original works that tease the line between literature and art, the aesthetic and the thematic. Maybe they are a manifestation of our desires, then and now, to cling onto the raw tangibility of the past through objects that paradoxically demonstrate both tradition and progress. 
In the end, I’m fascinated by artist’s books because they combine the inexplicable experiences of reading a novel and being in an art museum. Each page or iteration of an artist’s book is a fresh viewing experience, which I like to think of as a miniature gallery neatly packaged into a conveniently digestible medium. Just as a physical book can be artful by nature, art can tell a story or teach a lesson as well as any book. 
Famously, novelist and art theorist André Malraux mused, “An art book is a museum without walls.” 
Artist’s books are yet another way I find comfort in art because they combine the beauty of so many visual practices and demonstrate that the old and new are not mutually exclusive — or at the very least, they reassure me my devotion to print is not hopelessly romantic.

With Thanksgiving break beginning Wednesday, USC’s campus will grow quiet as thousands of students depart for home. Although it can be easy to stay alone in your room with Netflix and snacks and binge away feelings of homesickness or holiday blues, there are plenty of fun and exciting things to do. Here is a list of places to go and things to do at USC and around Los Angeles this Thanksgiving break.
Host a Friendsgiving dinner
Friendsgiving is a pre-Thanksgiving meal with friends where everyone contributes a dish for a potluck-style gathering. Even if chicken nuggets and mac and cheese replace the classic turkey and sweet potatoes, the memories made around the table will outshine any five-star recipe. 
Volunteer at a local food bank
You can show some gratitude by giving back to the community — whether by donating to an organization, sorting out produce bags for a local food bank or helping pass out meals on Thanksgiving Day, there are countless opportunities for volunteerism over break. One such event is the Lost Angels Children’s Project’s Thanksgiving at Venice Beach on Nov. 22, when volunteers pass out warm food, clothes and toiletries to residents living in poverty.
Ice skate at Pershing Square
Despite Los Angeles’ temperatures hardly dropping in the fall, the long-awaited holiday season is quickly approaching. What better way to celebrate the season than with a day of ice skating? Conveniently located in downtown Los Angeles, Pershing Square’s outdoor holiday skating rink is a delight to visitors. Ice skating sessions are affordable at only $9 per hour. 
Run in Turkey Trot L.A.
A Thanksgiving tradition around the country, the Turkey Trot marathon is a great way to see the city while staying active over break. Whether you’re an expert runner or just looking to have a good time, all levels are welcome. Both the 5K and 10K runs start in front of City Hall bright and early on Thanksgiving morning at 8 a.m. Registration is on-site and costs $45 for the 5K and $50 for the 10K.
Visit Knott’s Merry Farm
Advertised as Southern California’s premier annual holiday event, Knott’s Berry Farm decks itself out with festive decorations, delicious food and exciting attractions each year; chief among them are Mrs. Claus’ Kitchen and the Christmas Crafts Village. The attraction is open during all of Thanksgiving break and tickets are as low as $50 online.
Eat free community Thanksgiving dinner
If dining hall food or your limited culinary skills prove unsatisfactory, go enjoy a free community Thanksgiving dinner hosted by one of L.A.’s most popular vegan restaurants. Cafe Gratitude Larchmont will offer a free, healthy and delicious plant-based meal from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Nov. 22. There will be live music and plenty of dishes, ranging from vegan takes on Thanksgiving classics to newer alternative dishes, such as the lentil and butternut squash loaf or the kale, radicchio and persimmon salad.

Like our fellow students, we were drawn to USC because we wanted a university with a global outlook to call home. At USC, not only would we have the ability to broaden our global perspective socially and academically on campus, but we also could live and travel globally through international programs that are designed to help create global leaders. 
When each of us arrived on campus, it became glaringly obvious that though USC’s community and outlook span the globe, our environmental practices do not; USC does very little to address the catastrophic state of our changing environment. Environmental sustainability is arguably the largest problem facing our world, and USC cannot call itself a true global leader if it continues refusing to make sustainability a priority.  
USC has become a world-class institution in many respects — but not in environmental sustainability. We are a renowned research institution. We have rapidly climbed national rankings in academics and athletics. We have expanded our campus with the construction of USC Village. But our environmental performance lags far behind that of our peer institutions, far behind what our city and state expect of us and far behind what we expect of our university. Though many in the Trojan Family have worked hard to complete our Sustainability 2020 Plan, the plan’s goals are extremely modest, and we are not on schedule to meet all of them. We must do more — much more.
We address you now because the global environmental crisis has reached a critical point. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has made it clear that we have only 12 years to make “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. USC has the ability — and in turn, the responsibility — to aid in the mitigation of this global crisis. This is a truly transformative time for USC, and we see this as a unique opportunity for the new administration to prioritize sustainability.  
USC’s Environmental Core, Environmental Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government therefore urge USC’s leadership to commit to reaching these five goals as soon as possible: net zero water, net zero waste, net zero carbon, sustainability education and research as well as full transparency in developing a plan for reaching these goals and in assessing our progress toward them.
To aid in both accomplishing these goals and maintaining student involvement in sustainability at USC, we strongly support a living laboratories model as an essential component of reaching all five goals. Students are key players in the environmental movement on campus; engaging them in the shared work of making these crucial changes is vital.
On Nov. 30 at 1 p.m., our organizations will gather at Tommy Trojan to show support for the five requests delineated above. This peaceful demonstration will not be in protest of our current sustainability policies; rather, it will be in support of the creation of the University’s next aggressive, long-range Sustainability Plan. 
Meaningful sustainable changes at USC must take place extensively and swiftly. As students, we are always thinking about our futures, but now this question has become even more daunting. Beyond our careers, our social circles, our travels and our hobbies, we also must consider what quality of life will even be available to us. We are running out of time, and the choices that we make now will heavily impact the choices we are able to make in the future.
 
Fight On for sustainability,
Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, Milena Castillo-Grynberg, Olivia Pearson, 
Claire Mauss, 
Catherine Atkinson
Representatives from Environmental Core, Environmental Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government.

Yasmin Davis | Daily Trojan
This past weekend, USC’s crosstown rival UCLA hosted a national conference for the Students for Justice in Palestine. Established in 2010, the organization advocates for the rights of Palestinians living in Israel, with over 200 chapters on college campuses in the United States. 
When the conference was announced in August, objections were made. Especially in the weeks leading up to the event, with the horrific anti-Semitic shooting in Pittsburgh, calls to shut it down increased. However, calling for the suppression of Palestinian voices is wrong because of one simple reason: free speech. 
This column is not an endorsement of SJP’s message. As an Israeli-born American citizen, I condemn SJP for skewing facts about how my home country handles policy toward Palestinians. I condemn their refusal to acknowledge the terrorist acts Palestinians in Gaza engage in, especially when Hamas fired over 400 rockets in less than a day at Israeli citizens last week. 
But I cannot take away this group’s right to speak simply because I disagree with its message or distortion of information. USC professor Dan Schnur put it best at a talk he gave last week: “You don’t have to love what the First Amendment empowers to love the First Amendment.” 
So long as the SJP message is within the bounds of the law, I cannot advocate for the suppression of their speech. 
Here’s what I can do — diminish this speech’s value. When I was in high school, I listened to a talk by Holocaust survivor Ben Stern. In 1978, American neo-Nazis planned a march in Skokie, Illinois, the American city with the most Jews per capita at the time. Then, Stern decided he would not let their voices go uncontested. Because the government could not suppress the neo-Nazi march (the American Civil Liberties Union defended the neo-Nazi group’s right to march), Stern gathered signatures, wrote articles for the Chicago Tribune and brought attention to the hate march by coordinating a counter-protest. Despite countless threats to Stern and his family, he persisted. And thanks to Stern’s efforts, the neo-Nazis canceled the march of their own volition. 
I’m here to advocate against SJP’s message, fight the group’s positions on their merits, debate its leaders and defeat it intellectually and factually. I believe that preventing the organization from meeting is an act of cowardice; I am not afraid of them meeting, so long as I can challenge their positions. 
But, I want to ask SJP to extend the same courtesy to me when I want to host events contrary to their interests. When I want to hear from a speaker who may offend their members’ views, I ask them not to advocate for that speaker to be silenced. 
Historically, SJP members haven’t extended their challengers that courtesy. They interrupted the speeches of a former Israeli Prime Minister at the University of Chicago in 2009, an Israeli ambassador at UC Irvine in 2010, a Jewish philosophy professor at University of Minnesota Twin Cities in 2015, the mayor of Jerusalem at San Francisco State University in 2016 and an Israeli soldier in Australia in 2015. 
SJP has disrupted two pro-Israel events at UC Irvine this year and they have reportedly spit on and physically assaulted students at Stanford, Loyola University Chicago and Cornell in previous incidents. This is far from civil discourse. 
Despite this group’s notorious history, I stand for its right to host an uninterrupted event and will condemn anyone who stops them from hosting the event. 
I hope SJP remembers this column and appreciates the fact that some Americans object to their opinions but welcome their speech — despite their wholehearted disagreement and the organization’s history of neglecting its adversaries’ free speech rights. I hope SJP knows that there are some people out there who abide by Voltaire’s mantra, “I disapprove of what you say, but will fight to death for your right to say it.” 
Most importantly, I expect SJP to treat adversaries with the same respect and appreciate opponents’ rights just the same.

DPS sent an advisory email Monday warning students to beware of callers who say they are from the IRS or other services asking for money. (Adriana Sanchez | Daily Trojan)
The Department of Public Safety sent an email Monday warning students about recent scams targeting international students. 
This past semester, 17 students lost an average of $3,500 due to these scams, and some have lost up to $16,000, according to the email. 
Assistant Chief David Carlisle, said scammers ask for money posing as public entities such as the International Revenue Service or the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
“I’ve often said during orientation presentations, particularly to international students, that they’ll never be contacted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service saying they owe a fine,” Carlisle said. “In the last several months we’ve had a number of students who’ve been victimized that we decided we needed to put out a university-wide information bulletin to let students know to be aware of those scams.”
Freshman journalism student and Shanghai native Marilyn Chang said she has not been targeted by one of these scams, but that she knows not to engage with people or entities that ask her for money. 
“If I ever had an interaction with any company or center or institutions like that, [I would] hang up,” Chang said. “Just don’t talk to random strangers on the phone.” 
Kenneth Yim, a sophomore majoring in communication from South Korea, said he learned about IRS scams last year when he was studying at Emory University.
“I’m actually a transfer student and so I received IRS scam [training] from my previous university because [as] freshmen there they taught us about scams like that because they happened all the time,” Yim said. 
Carlisle said that scammers may target students on sites like Craigslist, and that students should arrange to pick up their orders at the DPS office if they suspect they are being scammed. 
In general, the email states that students who are making a transaction with a person they don’t know should request a DPS officer be present or ask the person to meet with them at the DPS station in the Downey Way Parking Structure. 
The email also warns students that some scammers may contact students on social media or via online chat platforms and make them believe they are entering a consensual online sexual encounter while secretly recording them. The scammers then threaten to make the video public unless the student pays them through money transfer services like MoneyGram and Western Union.
“This is a criminal act known as extortion and is a serious crime,” the email read. “Scams such as these can be avoided. Do not respond to friend requests from complete strangers. Never send strangers money or give them your credit card information.” 
Carlisle said that if students suspect they are being contacted by scammers or have been the victim of a scam, they should contact DPS immediately.
“If they feel they have been scammed and have been the victim, don’t be embarrassed. Call DPS,” Carlisle said. “We’re there to help them, and we will get the proper outside authorities involved whether it be the LAPD or some of those entities such as the IRS who have their own investigators.”

The new app, Dating Trojans, aims to connect past and current students with others affiliated with USC for both dating and networking. (Jonathon Xue | Daily Trojan)
After failing to find a partner on dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, USC alumnus Sergio Pedroza decided to create his own platform to connect Trojans. 
Last month, Pedroza founded Dating Trojans, an app for USC students and alumni to connect and form professional, personal and romantic relationships. 
“People will hopefully find love on our app, and that’s amazing, but it’s also dating professionals or just going out to get coffee with people that you would never have access to outside of your existing network,” Pedroza said. 
Pedroza said the app is also a way for students and graduates to stay connected.
Although users can currently download the app and get screened, the network won’t officially open until December 2018 or January 2019. 
For the screening process, the app verifies that all users previously attended or are currently attending USC. Pedroza said Dating Trojans will email potential users and ask them various questions such as their major, graduation year and which student organizations they were or are involved. 
Once the app determines that users are USC students or alumni, Pedroza said they will be given full access to see other users’ profiles and learn about various events on and around campus. 
Alumna Lindsay Mercadante said she gave Pedroza feedback on the app’s features and layout while he was developing it. 
Compared to other dating apps, Mercadante said Dating Trojans’ screening process allows users to know certain information before connecting with others on the app.
“Everyone is going to be a part of the Trojan network, which means that they’re an actual person and [that] is already something tangible that you have in common,” Mercadante said. “Each of the profiles are vetted and verified … so you’ll have [a guarantee] that you’re actually dealing with a person who has been proven to be exactly who they identify themselves as.”
USC alumnus Siddhant Gupta also said he gave Pedroza feedback on the app’s functions and design. He thinks having an app catered to the USC community will strengthen connections between users. 
“That is part of what makes it so unique and part of what will help make those better connections,” Gupta said. “USC is a very tight-knit community, the alumni association is so strong and the graduates have so much of a network. I think having that mutual connection will make it a little more special than other apps.” 
While Pedroza has not finalized all of the app’s features, he said users will be able to see multiple profiles at once, including images and personal information. Pedroza said he also plans to promote on-campus events and local restaurants where users can meet. 
He hopes that once the app officially opens, users will use it to make a variety of connections within the USC community.
“We put you in a position to land you that job. We put you in a position to network with someone that will absolutely benefit your career. We put you in a position to meet someone that you’re going to fall in love with and maybe marry one day,” Pedroza said. “That’s our ultimate goal, to be the bridge between people within that network and allow them to accomplish amazing things like we’ve always been told we can do.”

Sanil Chawla, a freshman in the Iovine and Young Academy, created a nonprofit to help young entrepreneurs find funding. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
After creating a nonprofit organization that helps students form their own start-up funded by companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook, freshman Sanil Chawla became the youngest person to be featured in the education category of this year’s Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list.
“I always looked at the 30 Under 30 list and a lot of the people on the list have been inspirations for me,” the Iovine and Young Academy student said.
Chawla created Hack+ to remove legal and financial barriers in creating companies for those under the age of 18. 
During his sophomore year of high school, Chawla attempted to start a company that designed websites. He soon realized he needed a guardian’s signature in all paperwork involved, as well as being unable to create a separate bank account as a minor. 
To initiate a start-up in California, creators must dish out at least $1,000 in legal fees, according to Chawla. The high cost of incorporation results from required fees and industry-specific licenses, including naming, filing, handling and business licenses.
“There were so many issues that I began thinking about whether there’s a possibility to create a better way for all of this to happen for minors,” Chawla said.
Hack+ now works with more than 600 students who run over 50 organizations or events, according to Chawla. The company allows student-run nonprofit organizations to be created under Hack+  and the service acts as an umbrella nonprofit that is responsible for paperwork and startup fees minors cannot complete independently. Hack+ also provides students assistance, such as accounting, cloud storage and budgeting.
Chawla was inspired to create Hack+ by his father Vipin Chawla, a start-up investor.
While in elementary school, Sanil imitated his father’s work by creating unofficial startups with his friends, including one that made individualized greeting cards. 
During these early years, Vipin Chawla said his son demonstrated “entrepreneurial tendencies.”
“It might look like a smooth journey to an outsider that someone so young as him achieved Forbes 30 Under 30, but he’s faced his fair share of setback,” said Carolyn Ge, Chawla’s close friend and a freshman at Harvard University.
Chawla said he emphasized his role as a student when persuading sponsors to understand the purpose of Hack+. 
“Saying I’m also a student who’s running this, they know that I know exactly what a student is going through and I have that level of relatability,” Chawla said. “You can turn your age into a powerful thing.”
Despite his youth, Chawla said he was not afraid of engaging with larger corporations to gain sponsorships for Hack+.
“It’s a huge step to get them to take you seriously when you’re young,” Chawla said. “Knowing everything about what you’re doing, every number, literally every little detail is really important because it shows you know what you’re doing.”
