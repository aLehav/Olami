USC announced on Thursday that sophomore shooting guard De’Anthony Melton would not play for the remainder of the season. Melton has not played in any games so far this year. He was held out in the midst of an internal investigation into his involvement in the Tony Bland bribery case. The assistant coach was indicted in November.

“Based on information discovered through its internal investigation regarding the receipt of extra benefits, primarily to a close family friend of De’Anthony Melton, USC has concluded that De’Anthony will not compete with the USC men’s basketball team in the 2017-18 season,” the University announced on its official athletics website. 
Prosecutors told the Los Angeles Times they believe Melton’s family friend, David Elliot was offered a cash incentive to influence the player into signing with sports agent Christian Dawkins once he decided to leave for the NBA. Bland pleaded not guilty to the charges in November. In addition to Melton, Bland is accused of funneling payments to a companion of a different unidentified recruit in the 2018 class. 
Melton himself has not been accused of accepting improper cash benefits. “It’s sort of the whole impression they’re concerned about,” Melton’s attorney Vicki I. Podberesky told the LA Times. “It’s very disappointing, but not unexpected.” 
He will remain on scholarship, but he can no longer travel with the team. The school left a 2018-19 return open as a possibility in its announcement. 
At least one player did not take too kindly to the news. Junior power forward Chimezie Metu voiced his frustration with the USC athletic department on Twitter. 
“Punishing innocent ppl… I see what y’all on now @USC_Athletics,” Metu wrote. 
He followed it up by tweeting, “‘He didn’t do anything wrong but let’s suspend him bc we’re selfish and have to protect our image’… makes sense.” 
Last season, Melton averaged 8.3 points, 4.7 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game as a true freshman. Without him, the Trojans have a 12-6 record.

After a huge comeback win against Oregon State Sunday, the women’s basketball team looks to keep its momentum going as they head to the mountains to take on Colorado and Utah. 
In their last game, the Trojans struggled to keep up with Oregon State until they came alive in the second half to secure the win. They are hoping to replicate the intensity, energy and defense of that second half  to come away with two victories this weekend.
“We got the ball to who we needed to get the ball to, we penetrated, we drew help, we got the ball to [Kristen Simon] for some easy finishes, Minyon [Moore] made the free throws down the stretch and Aliyah [Mazyck] had a big 3-pointer,” senior guard Sadie Edwards said. “So I think we take that and just being disciplined. We didn’t force, we didn’t rush shots, we moved the ball, we trusted the system, so I think if we do that it’ll give us the chance to win.”
USC forced 13 steals in the important victory. They gave up just 61 points, the lowest number the Trojans have allowed in Pac-12 play this season.
“We needed to win a game like that,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “[A game] where we grinded and came back and executed in the last four minutes. I’m really proud of what the kids did.”
Despite their 1-3 record in conference play, the Trojans have been putting up strong numbers in contests against quality opponents. Senior forward Kristen Simon, junior guard Aliyah Mazyck and sophomore guard Minyon Moore are all averaging 15 or more points per game, with Simon averaging 17.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. In contrast, Colorado and Utah’s leading scorers, Kennedy Leonard and Daneesha Provo, are averaging 14.9 and 14.3 points per game, respectively. Even with its upset win over No. 16 Oregon State in the rearview mirror, the team still possesses its fair share of naysayers. 
“We were picked to finish eighth so we’re playing with house money,” Trakh said. “We just go out there and play and hopefully beat some people. We’re a confident underdog right now. We just go out and play and say, ‘Hey, you’re supposed to beat us, all you seven teams ahead of us’ … so I think the kids play relaxed and they play to win, instead of playing not to lose. That enables our kids to play to win.”
As the team is battling on the court every week to prove disbelievers wrong, they also are required to keep up with their classes. Getting time off from school during winter break allowed the Trojans to focus solely on their basketball games, but as the new semester begins, academics returns as a major component of the players’ schedules. However, the team says the start of classes does not affect its focus or conviction in what it will try to bring to every game for the rest of the season.
“Nothing really changes,” Moore said. “Obviously, academics are very stressed here at USC and our coaches put a stress on academics to make sure we’re doing well on both the court and in the classroom, so nothing is really going to be any different. We have the support from USC, from our staff …  it is going to be extra homework and whatnot, but we will still have the same game plan and the same focus.”
USC will take on Colorado on Friday at 6 p.m. and Utah at 12 p.m. on Sunday. Both games will be televised on Pac-12 Los Angeles and Pac-12 Networks.

Fresh off of a 70-58 victory on Wednesday night over the Colorado Buffaloes, the USC men’s basketball team will rest for a couple days before welcoming the Utah Utes to Galen Center Sunday night.

In light of the recent suspension of sophomore shooting guard De’Anthony Melton by the University for his involvement in the Tony Bland scandal, the Trojans hope to use the momentum from their recent victory over Colorado to pull off another home victory before traveling up north to play both Oregon and Oregon State.
The Utes, meanwhile, come into Sunday’s game with a similar 10-5 record overall and 2-2 Pac-12 record and the second-best scoring defense in the conference.
After a successful road trip to both Oregon schools, the Utes lost two straight games to Arizona and Arizona State last weekend. 
Led by a stingy defense, Utah is anchored by a combination of explosive guard play and physical forwards who can protect the paint.
Starting forwards Tyler Rawson and David Collette are both 6’10” and capable of scoring double figures every night. While Collette is known for being more of a post player, Rawson can step outside and shoot an outside shot with efficiency, hitting 26 of his 66 3s this season. 
In terms of Utah’s other outside shooters, guard Justin Bibbins may be small at just 5’8” and 150 lb., but he has hit 36 of his 80 3-point attempts this season and has scored 98 points in his past five games. 
In response, to Utah’s size, USC will look to big men Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright to carry the brunt of the Utes’ offensive and defensive force.
Although Metu made just three of his 13 shots against Colorado, the junior forward contributed on the defensive end by collecting season-highs in blocks (6) and rebounds (13).
In terms of USC’s other starters, guards senior Elijah Stewart and sophomore Jonah Mathews have experienced some inconsistent play in the Pac-12. 
Stewart, a proficient 3-point shooter for USC last season, is averaging just 7.4 points per game and has hit just three 3-pointers on 14 shots (21 percent). 
Mathews, Stewart’s backcourt counterpart, has similarly struggled, hitting his first long balls in Pac-12 play on Wednesday night versus Colorado, breaking a streak of 10 straight missed 3s. 
To pick up the slack, USC’s bench has been surging as of late, as Jordan Usher and forward Nick Rakocevic have played huge offensive spark plugs for a Southern California squad that has struggled shooting the ball.
Usher, who has been praised by USC coaches for his physicality and aggressive play, leads Trojan freshmen in terms of minutes (13.1) and scoring (3.4). 
Rakocevic is another Trojan who has shot and scored well, while also providing help defensively. Since USC’s win over Washington State, the sophomore has made 24 of his last 34 shots (70 percent) for 52 points and 27 rebounds.
Even if Rakocevic and the rest of the Troy bench can contribute offensively, USC has struggled to shoot and defend the perimeter in Pac-12 play. 
If the team doesn’t protect the perimeter like it did against Stanford (5-22), the Trojans could be in for a long night defensively.
The Trojans are set to tip off against the Utes at 5 p.m. on Sunday at the Galen Center.

Legacy.
Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
It’s a meaningful word to most, but we have a special obsession with the term in sports. Athletic legacies can be built in a matter of days or even seconds: A group of anonymous amateurs can become national heroes after three fateful weeks and one Miracle on Ice in the Adirondack Mountains. Just four days ago, a 19-year-old benchwarmer transformed into a college football legend in the span of a couple hours (condolences to Georgia native and new sports editor Trevor Denton).
But most lasting marks on the world of sports are made through years of excellence — and they end in plaques, whether in Heritage Hall, or Canton. Athletic Director Lynn Swann knows this better than almost anyone. His outstanding career as a Trojan and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver earned him spots in both USC’s and professional football’s halls of fame. He expanded his legacy even further following his playing days, making a successful transition into broadcasting, earning a gubernatorial nomination in Pennsylvania and serving in President George W. Bush’s administration.
Now, Swann seems intent on creating a legacy as his alma mater’s AD. It’s been just under two years since he succeeded Pat Haden as USC’s athletic director, but Swann has already rocked the boat. Though the alleged violations in the men’s basketball corruption scandal occurred under his predecessor, Swann made the choice to extend sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton’s suspension until the end of the season after the University concluded an internal investigation this week. It was an unpopular decision. Nevertheless, with the NCAA’s long history of heavy punishments for petty crimes, Swann prioritized protecting the program’s long-term reputation, even if it came at the cost of Melton’s development as a player.
The new AD has gotten busy in other areas as well — namely, coaching changes. His first move came last March, when former women’s basketball head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke resigned following another rough season in which the Women of Troy finished 5-13 in conference play. The eventual return of former Trojan Mark Trakh has so far proven to be a masterstroke: Under its new coach, the team has rebounded to 11-4 so far this season.
But then came five-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year Richard Gallien’s sudden departure from the women’s tennis program. After 22 years at USC, Gallien said he would not be returning on March 24. Three-time Pac-12 champion Zenon Babraj also resigned as head coach of the women’s rowing program in May. Finally, Swann fired Mick Haley in December, letting go of an active AVCA Hall-of-Famer after he delivered two women’s volleyball national championships.
Swann replaced Gallien with Alison Swain, a coach with a spectacular track record at the Division III level, having won eight national titles in 10 years with Williams College. He then poached Josh Adam from Washington State to take Babraj’s place as rowing coach. On Wednesday, Brent Crouch — head coach of the University of Portland for the last four seasons — was named as Haley’s successor.
It may seem odd that Swann, who played under stalwart John McKay at USC and spent all nine of his NFL seasons in Pittsburgh, decided to do away with the stability of more than a half-century of Trojan coaching. Maybe water polo’s Pac-12 Coach of the Century and 14-time national champion Jovan Vavic needs to watch his back (I’m only joking, of course, but I would’ve made the same joke about the aforementioned trio a year ago). Regardless, one thing is clear: Swann has already stamped his mark on USC athletics. This is now his show — his legacy.
It’s neither a surprise nor a coincidence that, despite their sparkling resumes, Haley, Gallien and Babraj hadn’t delivered the ultimate prize in more than a decade when they were let go (Haley last earned the NCAA crown in 2003, while Gallien and Babraj never won it all at USC). After winning two Rose Bowls, one national title as a Trojan and four Super Bowls in Pittsburgh, perhaps Swann believes that that success should translate into silverware more often than it has in recent years. Whether that’s a manifestation of his championship mentality or simple delusion, only time will tell.

Last Friday, Provost Michael Quick announced the reorganization of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund in an effort to increase the number of students who can benefit from its resources. 
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
The Topping Fund, which was established in 1970, aims to bridge a gap between low-income, first-generation students and their peers at USC. The Fund is the only student initiated, funded and administered scholarship in the country, according to the NTSAF website. Nearly 150 students at USC currently benefit from the program — and Quick says he wants to make it available to more students. While his efforts are a productive step toward increasing access for underrepresented students at the University, the decision by the Provost’s office exemplifies a blatant disregard for the historical significance and student-led nature of the program.
In this attempt to expand the program, though not mentioned in Quick’s initial memo, administration has eliminated the fund’s program director position — a position that has provided a support system for Topping scholars, many of whom have had to overcome considerable hardships and trauma in pursuit of their education. 
NTSAF is more than just a scholarship for the students involved in the program. While it aids students financially, NTSAF also becomes a support mechanism for scholars as they strive to succeed at an institution like USC. Among the scholars are students from various underrepresented groups, including undocumented students, former foster youth, survivors of sexual abuse and LGBT students — and while all of their backgrounds are different, NTSAF provides scholars with what they call a “Topping family,” which very much includes the program director.
In eliminating the position, which was held by Christina Yokoyama for 11 years, USC is depriving future generations of Topping Scholars the same support system that has been provided for hundreds of scholars in the past. In addition, removing the position may hinder the program’s ability to work as a fully functioning help center for new scholars.
Andrea Hodge, the vice provost for undergraduate programs, explained in a letter to Topping scholars that administration officials “have the opportunity to grow the program while maintaining all of the important benefits that it provides.” Expanding the resources of NTSAF to more students is necessary to address the growing population of underrepresented students on campus. But this expansion cannot be completed effectively with limited staff at the Topping office. 
Expanding the program without any additional space would eliminate the one-on-one attention that these scholars currently receive through Yokoyama and associate director Trista Beard. In an article published in the Daily Trojan last semester titled “Bridging USC’s first-generation gap,” Beard described how the Topping directors gave a “warm hand-off” to students when relaying them to resources, mentors and other programs on campus. Removing the position would eliminate that transition and instead change the essence of NTSAF into a solely monetary-based scholarship.
Part of what makes the Topping Fund remarkable is not just the financial burden it alleviates in order to give students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to attend a university like USC, but it’s the community that it fosters and the support it provides. The majority of Topping scholars are first-generation college students, and at a university that does not have a first-generation student resource center, the staff — led by the program director — at the Topping Fund plays a vital role in helping students navigate unfamiliar terrain. 
Following the elimination of the program director, the Daily Trojan was flooded with letters to the editor opposing the changes to NTSAF, including some from faculty, current Topping Scholars, past NTSAF Governing Board Chairs and even former Undergraduate Student President and Topping Scholar Edwin Saucedo. All of them discussed the significance of the Topping community and how they were impacted by it. When reading these letters, it is difficult to think of the Topping scholarship as just a monetary award — it is an ear to listen, an empty chair to sit and share stories, a space to shed insecurities in a shared sense of belonging. 
The University’s intent to expand the Topping family is important, but the way in which it was approached is flawed. If the University aims to expand the reach of the Topping Fund, then it should have engaged in a collaborative effort with the scholars and staff. Yet neither the scholars nor the board say they were consulted in the process. 
If USC truly wants the Topping Fund and family to grow and flourish, the Topping community must be included in the conversation. Integral to the fabric of USC, NTSAF has brought us a USG president, USG senators, a Rhodes Scholar and even Daily Trojan writers and editors. Bringing more of these students to campus is a positive thing, but it must be done in the right way. Topping scholars deserve to be heard, and USC must learn to listen.

When it comes to seeing the actual neighborhood of Hollywood, most visitors wander the boulevard, stare at the sidewalk stars, browse the cheap souvenir shops, take a sightseeing tour and miss the heart and soul of the place entirely. 
It is possible to experience it like the locals do, but visitors must avoid the slow-moving sea of humanity on Hollywood Boulevard. Here are five places to skip the tourists and crowded sidewalks, and become a part of the local crowd. 
1. Yamashiro
Photo from Yelp
Finished in 1914 as a private residence and showplace, Yamashiro has been, through the years, a mansion, a boys’ military school, a members-only club for golden- age Hollywood elite and today sits as a restaurant and hotel. While tourists eat sushi at a high-end joint on Hollywood and Vine and pay too much for an upscale name, you’ll be gazing at the koi in the garden pond that mixes nicely with the Hollywood Hills set. If nothing else, head up for a drink and the vista. With its crowning location at the tip-top of the hill on Sycamore Avenue, it offers enchanting views of the Los Angeles basin.
 
2. The High Tower Stairs
Photo from Yelp
The Hollywood Heights micro-neighborhood of High Tower Court is perhaps best known for its role in the film The Long Goodbye. But for residents, it is known as a serious workout. 
One of a few hill neighborhoods in Los Angeles inaccessible to cars, it is a maze of pedestrian streets and stairs that the primary architect, Carl Kay, said was modeled after hillside-clinging Positano in Italy. Kay built the private elevator — the High Tower — circa 1920 because his wife got tired of climbing all the stairs. Meanwhile, tourists will be at Runyon Canyon, the park to the east that is open to dogs, where it’s crowded, noisy with chatter and smells of doggy waste.
3. Mashti Malone’s 
Photo from Yelp
Don’t let the questionable exterior of the grungy two-story strip mall scare you  it does most tourists; the ice cream served at Mashti Malone’s is the perfect treat for a hot day in L.A. The franchise was launched 30 years ago when two Iranian brothers — one named Mashti — bought an ice cream shop on La Brea Avenue called Mugsy Malone’s, but couldn’t afford to replace the whole sign. With flavors like saffron, orange blossom with pistachios, lavender and rosewater, the place is a favorite local destination for a cool taste of the Middle East.
 
4. Tiago Coffee Bar
Photo from Yelp
Admittedly, you will find a couple of tourists in Tiago Coffee Bar + Kitchen. But they’re only the European ones who’ve sniffed out the best coffee in the neighborhood — perhaps in all of Los Angeles. Owned by an Argentine who really knows his beans, Tiago prides itself on handcrafted, authentic coffee, often in the European style, that comes in just one size option. Even a regular cup of joe is made to order, so don’t be impatient. But do try a cappuccino — it’s one of the best outside of Italy.
5. The Musso & Frank Grill
Photo from Yelp
The lack of tourists in Musso & Frank on an average night is perplexing because of its location right on Hollywood Boulevard. Perhaps because it is on the end of that famous stretch that caters to local nightlife and not the busloads of tourists down the street staring at the Chinese Theater, it is essentially a neighborhood hangout. 
Opened in 1919, the Grill has seen every incarnation of Hollywood, both the neighborhood and the “biz.” It is still possible to sit in Charlie Chaplin’s favorite booth and watch — discreetly — as modern A-listers slink in through the back door. Much of the staff have worked there for decades, and if one is old enough, the martinis are tops. Just don’t ask the bartender to shake it.

Last year, California passed a new law allowing women to obtain birth control pills from their local pharmacy without a prescription, providing that the pharmacist in question has obtained adequate information about the woman’s medical history and the presence (or absence) of underlying health concerns.
Other than expediting a needlessly onerous process, the law also contributes to making the service far more equitable than ever before. Prior to the law’s passage, receiving a prescription for something as commonplace as the traditional birth control pill required women to schedule an appointment with a gynecologist — not a general practitioner or their regular doctor, but a specialist — and maintain this appointment annually for as long as they take the pill. It’s naturally reasonable to expect a doctor’s consent to be necessary to gain access to a drug — but compared to the existing list of easily obtained, over-the-counter medication, the birth control pill is hardly risky, having served millions of American women for over 50 years without any significant issues. And this service would not make birth control over-the-counter, but rather under the purview of a far more accessible medical practitioner. Moreover, this further contributes to a preexisting trend of the local pharmacy becoming a place of cheap and easy access to simple medical care, like checkups, flu shots and basic consultations. 
But aside from questions of the medical validity of the law, it addresses issues far more commonplace, and increasingly widespread: the commodification of medical treatment and health education and the distribution of these commodities almost singularly among the upper-middle classes and the wealthy. With national healthcare under attack and public medical service programs in danger of massive cuts, access to consistent and specialized medical care is a luxury many women simply can’t afford (one of the many reasons national healthcare was so necessary in the first place — but that’s another conversation). 
When it comes to a pill as tried and tested as average birth control, to require women of all socioeconomic backgrounds to pass an economic barrier to gain access is, plain and simple, inefficient and inequitable. Women should and must have access to medical services regardless of income; to state otherwise is to suggest the value of human health, and by extension, human life, can be quantified by a price tag. And for college-aged women struggling with financial burdens like tuition, educational materials, transportation and rent, removing barriers to basic health services like birth control is a necessary step in ensuring that they can continue to work toward their goals, graduate, and contribute their skills to a larger California — and nationwide — society. 
However, while the law carries certain benefits, most Californian women won’t experience them simply because most are unaware that they are available. As simple as it seems, health education, especially among the lower-middle and lower classes, remains exceptionally poor — meaning many women are unaware that this is now a privilege available to them as state citizens. Moreover, the law was also not accompanied by a plan that would provide for how pharmacies would integrate these new measures into their existing managerial structures. One woman speaking to the Los Angeles Times said that she talked to her local pharmacist about the law, who told her they had yet to form their own policy to comply; another pharmacist told her they were unaware of the law entirely. 
So, the question becomes: How can California hope to offer the women on its college campuses this service if it has not taken measures to phase in implementation to the wider group of pharmacies that populate the state? Luckily for USC students, the Engemann Student Health Center already offers students birth control pills and alternatives as well as the specialists necessary to gain access. This is not true for all of California’s campuses, particularly some CSUs and community colleges. 
While this law is a necessary first step and represents movement in the right direction, college students should continue to demand equitable access to health care according to their rights as defined by state laws. In turn we should expect our representatives to listen to the outcry, work to support health education and stimulate and incentivize implementation so that access can be extended to those outside of the state’s wealthiest classes. 
While I agree that more pharmacists should become engaged in providing birth control,, it is not as simple as just deciding to “do it”. The law does not require pharmacists or pharmacies to provide birth control- it allows it IF the pharmacist has received the training (continuing education) to do so. Unfortunately the law did not require insurance companies or MediCal to pay for the pharmacist time to provide the service- that has been the biggest hang-up. A law was passed in 2016 and became effective in January 2017 REQUIRING MediCal to pay for the service however the state has failed to create a process for paying for the service. Women should demand their insurance companies and MediCal cover the pharmacist provided birth control services. Women should contact their legislators and demand action on coverage for the pharmacist services and for action on coverage for a12 month supply of birth control which also went into effect over a year ago and is still not being appropriately covered by insurance companies.

This Tuesday, composer, pianist and humanitarian Sophia Serghi flew from the East Coast to share her story of discovering refugee musicians with a diverse group from the USC and Los Angeles community. Serghi, who is a professor of music theory and composition at the College of William and Mary, traveled in 2009 to Kenya as a volunteer to repair an orphanage’s kitchen in the village of Kiberia, while also hoping to meet Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai. In Kiberia, there are many refugees from surrounding African nations, such as Somalia and Ethiopia, currently in political strife.

During this trip, Serghi brought along multiple instruments to play as well as a microphone, which the orphans and refugee children took an interest in. The children took turns with the microphone and rapped about their families as well as experiences of which social workers had not previously been aware of. This experience inspired Serghi to continue to promote the healing elements of music in refugee communities, and especially the power of voice in song as a method of communication and overcoming trauma. 
When asked what problem she is trying to solve and why, Serghi said, “The abolition of indifference, because I am passionate about the human potential.”
Originally from the Republic of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Serghi allowed her curiosity about people to develop into a documentary called Voice Out of Silence. She organized a GoFundMe, which, according to its page, aims to “create an online documentary series to promote amazingly talented musicians who perform on City Streets and other venues and create sustainable funding opportunities for them.” The fundraiser managed to collect $10,650. In the process of making this documentary, Serghi organized a Street Music Festival in the divided city of Nicosia, which is Turkish in the north and Greek in the south, mediated by a United Nations buffer zone. The music ranged from traditional Greek and Turkish music to jazz to American country, and the musicians were well received by the public, with the exception of a few encounters with the police. To Serghi’s surprise, this was the first event of its type to be organized in Cyprus.  
The documentary continued in Israel where it was Serghi’s goal to find the street musician whose photo was featured in her GoFundMe campaign. Upon arriving in Israel, Serghi and her team explored the streets and eventually found the man, Dor, surrounded by other musicians with a vast variety of instruments from around the world. In Jerusalem, Serghi encountered an Israeli soldier playing a Greek instrument called a bouzouki and singing a Greek song. The soldier said he had never been to Greece, but simply wanted to spend time playing beautiful music before returning to his barracks.  
Eventually, the title changed from Voice Out of Silence to Music on the Move and is a continuous project by Serghi and her team. Serghi said her next destination is Egypt.

On Sunday, at Stanford’s Maple Pavilion, USC built a double-digit lead over the Cardinal twice and squandered it both times, resulting in a tragic buzzer-beater loss.

But on Wednesday, at the Galen Center, the Trojans built a double-digit lead in the second half against the Colorado Buffaloes, and their lead held en route to a 70-58 win.
“Our players bounced back and played extremely well tonight,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “I am proud of our effort.” 
The game was defined by scrappy play as neither the Trojans (12-6, 3-2) nor the Buffs (10-7, 2-3) wished to fall below .500 in conference play. The lead changed seven times in the first half, each team shooting 6-11 from the 3-point range. 
Aside from the shooting, nothing else was finesse about the half. Turnovers were an issue for both squads, USC committed eight and Colorado, twelve. The Trojans’ starters only scored 21 points, but the bench filled the void with 17 to give USC a slim 38-34 lead. 
Sophomore guard Jonah Mathews, who did not start tonight, provided a big spark off the bench with 9 points. 
Regarding his decision to start redshirt junior guard Shaqquan Aaron over Mathews, Enfield said, “Sometimes you just need to shake things up. [Mathews] wasn’t himself and wasn’t playing up to his capabilities. Tonight, he just played great.” 
Mathews said he was not bothered by having to give up his starting role. 
Nevertheless, Mathews played starters’ minutes — 27 to be exact — because Aaron was limited by foul trouble.
In the second half, the Trojans buckled down on defense to hold the Buffaloes to 24 points. Junior forward Chimezie Metu fiercely protected the rim, recording a career-high six blocks. 
“[Metu] was a monster inside,”  Enfield said. “He brought energy on defense.”
Metu finished with a gorgeous statline: 14 points, 13 rebounds, six blocks, plus two steals and an assist. Although he only shot 3-13 from the field, he shot 8-8 from the free throw line. His battering mate down-low, junior forward Bennie Boatwright, also shot poorly. In fact, he played his worst game of the season, finishing 1-9 from the floor with only three points.
Despite USC’s two leading scorers this season combining for a pitiful 4-22 from the floor, the Trojans shot 24-55 (43.6 percent) as a team and 9-17 (52.9 percent) from the 3-point range. Senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who prefers to pass first, shifted his mentality. He scored 20 points with only three assists.
Alongside him in the backcourt, redshirt sophomore guard Derryck Thornton had his best performance of the year. Handsy and in-your-face on defense, Thornton stole the ball four times. The Trojans forced 22 turnovers. Additionally, Thornton shot 4-6 from the field. The rhythm on both sides of the ball seemed in sync with Thornton throughout the game.
Overall, Enfield viewed the victory as a step in the right direction. 
“We’re not a finished product,” Enfield said, adding that he is very impressed with the team’s direction. “We’ve been playing good basketball the last four games. We’re 1.7 seconds away from being 4-0.” 
In a crowded Pac-12 field, defending home court is imperative. The Trojans will look for the sweep over the mountain schools this Sunday when facing Utah at the Galen Center.

As the USC football team transitions into the offseason, the team’s best players are met with the decision to declare for the NFL Draft or prolong their careers in cardinal and gold. 
Any team with USC’s ability to attract top-tier recruits will lose a significant amount of talent after each season, and this year is no different. The offensive side of the ball will look especially new as head coach Clay Helton looks ahead to the 2018 season.
Players Who Are Leaving

Sam Darnold, USC’s star quarterback, is the biggest name out of USC’s departures. The redshirt sophomore has been at the top of draft boards since he led the Trojans to nine straight wins and a Rose Bowl victory in 2016. 
Darnold completed 63.1 percent of his passes for 4,143 yards, 26 touchdowns and 13 interceptions this season. Despite issues with ball security, Darnold’s arm strength, pocket awareness and ability to throw on the run have been enough to solidify his position as a definite top-five pick. He and UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen are the two most likely candidates to be picked first overall by the Cleveland Browns.
Running back Ronald Jones II was the team’s most consistent playmaker this season, tallying 1,550 yards and 19 touchdowns in 2017. The junior, who leaves as USC’s fifth all-time leading rusher, is projected to be drafted in the second or third round. However, his explosiveness and physicality could potentially convince a team to take him on the first day.
The most recent draft declaration came from junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett on Monday. The six-foot, 170-pound wideout was Darnold’s favorite target for much of the season, catching 86 passes for 1,114 yards and nine scores. Despite lacking elite size, speed or strength, Burnett’s route-running and toughness made him integral to the Trojans’ offense, and should be enough to earn him a selection in the fourth or fifth round.
USC will lose perhaps its best defensive player in senior outside linebacker and team captain Uchenna Nwosu. 
Besides his 75 tackles and 9.5 sacks this season, fans will remember Nwosu for his fourth down goal line tackle of Stanford running back Bryce Love III in the fourth quarter of the Pac-12 Championship Game, a key stop in the Trojans’ 31-28 victory. 
Nwosu is generally regarded as a mid-round prospect; he’s adept as an edge rusher and has the uncanny ability to knock down passes at the line, but he must work on his pass coverage to succeed at the next level.
The team will lose its second leading tackler in redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins. At 5’11” and 190 pounds, Hawkins, even more than Burnett, lacks the measurables of NFL players in his position. Although he was a fantastic college safety, there’s no guarantee he will be drafted.
Confirmed Returners
Nwosu’s fellow captain and linebacker Cameron Smith announced Wednesday that he would be returning for his senior year. The junior led the team with 112 total tackles and took over defensive alignment and calls this year. Smith is a smart and instinctual player who makes quick reads and flies to the ball. His experience and leadership will be crucial to a team seeking continuity in the face of so many question marks on offense. 
Left tackle Toa Lobendahn also stated Wednesday that he will return for his last season in cardinal and gold. The redshirt junior enjoyed his first healthy season as a Trojan in 2017 after the previous two were cut short by knee injuries.
Junior right tackle Chuma Edoga also confirmed his return in December.
Outside linebacker Porter Gustin announced last week that he would be returning for his senior year. Gustin, who received some draft hype before the season, played only four games this season due to a torn bicep and  broken toe.
Potential Departures
The last high-level prospect who could declare for the draft is defensive end Rasheem Green. Green’s ten sacks were good for the second most in the Pac-12 as the junior used his burst to get to the quarterback. 
Green may decide to return for his senior season to increase his strength, which should remain a concern when translating to the NFL. However, his quickness and hand technique could qualify him for rounds 3 through 5.
There are a few other prospects who could enter the draft, but would likely be late round picks and should heavily consider staying at USC for at least another year. 
Junior cornerback Iman Marshall entered the season on the watch list for the Jim Thorpe Award for best defensive back, but an inconsistent and injury-plagued season derailed his high expectations. 
Junior safety Marvell Tell III and redshirt sophomore linebacker John Houston Jr. were productive defenders, but could also use an extra year to hone their craft.

As the players and coaching staff walked off the field in Arlington, Tex., after a disappointing loss to Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl, their focus was already beginning to shift to next season.

“Now, it’s trying to make it to the playoff and win a national championship,” head coach Clay Helton said after the game. “We won’t be satisfied until that happens.” 
Though the season has ended, the next two months present an incredibly important challenge for USC football, as they must fight to bring in recruits who will shape the foundation of the team for years to come. This year, the college football recruiting process looks different from previous years, as there are now two signing periods, as opposed to just one. The first chance players have to sign with a school, dubbed the “early signing period,” took place from Dec. 20-22. USC’s class ranked 13th in the nation coming out of this early signing period, according to Rivals. They signed 10 players, but have several more hard commitments from players expected to sign on National Signing Day in February.
Headlining USC’s signed commits in the 2018 class are inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote, the highest-ranked linebacker in ESPN’s ratings, and athlete Talanoa Hufanga, the top-rated prospect from the state of Oregon. Gaoteote, who played in  high school at national powerhouse, Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas, chose USC though many experts believed he would sign with Ohio State. Hufanga is listed as an athlete, though he will likely play as a safety at USC due to his range and ball skills.
 Though they have not signed yet, two of USC’s top recruits have made hard commitments to play for the Trojans in 2018. Quarterback JT Daniels, the reigning Gatorade and Maxpreps National Football Player of the Year, and his high school teammate Amon-Ra St. Brown, the consensus top receiver from California, both intend to sign with USC in February. 
Daniels, who just finished his junior year of high school, is reclassifying to enroll early, and is expected to compete for the starting job next year with Sam Darnold declaring for the NFL Draft. Daniels comes from Mater Dei High School, where former USC greats Matt Leinart and Matt Barkley also played, but there is speculation from some scouts that Daniels could be the best of the group. In 2017, he accounted for more than 4,500 yards and 61 touchdowns, while only throwing four interceptions and leading his team to a perfect 15-0 season, all while holding the No. 1 ranking nationally. 
St. Brown, the 10th-ranked player and second-rated receiver in the nation, according to ESPN, committed to USC on Jan. 6 during the Army All-American Football game. St. Brown has one brother, Orisis, who plays for Stanford, and another, Equanimeous, who just completed his career at Notre Dame. Both schools heavily recruited the five-star talent, but ultimately, he chose to carve his own path and announce his intent to sign with the Trojans. He was named offensive MVP of the Army All-American game for his four catch, 93-yard performance. 
Other notable signings for USC include Markese Stepp from Indianapolis, the 13th-rated running back in the nation, Chase Williams, an athlete from Corona, Calif., Justin Dedich, the second highest-rated center in the country and Raymond Scott, a top-5 outside linebacker.

When the USC football team traveled to play Washington State last September, a Cougars fan in line to enter Martin Stadium held up a sign that read “Unsolved Mysteries” across the top. Below it was a line that read, “Can USC win without cheating?” and below that were cutouts of USC sports figures involved in infamous scandals since the turn of the century, including Reggie Bush, Pete Carroll and O.J. Mayo. At the end was the newest addition: Tony Bland.
 It was a clever sign. But beyond that, the fact that a Washington sports fan knew enough about USC athletics to make that sign put into perspective the national attitude surrounding this program. And the Bland scandal has simply added fuel to the fire, implicating USC in a nationwide corruption case that has rocked the college basketball world.
 Fast forward to last Saturday at the Coors Event Center in Boulder, Colorado. The Colorado men’s basketball team had just upset Arizona and Tad Boyle, their head coach, was speaking postgame. One reporter asked if Boyle had any extra satisfaction beating Arizona considering its involvement in the same corruption case.
 “Absolutely,” Boyle said. “They recruit very, very well. USC has recruited very, very well. The two most talented teams in our league from top to bottom are USC and Arizona. So, hell yes, there’s extra satisfaction … Got great respect for [USC head coach] Andy Enfield. But to answer your question: Hell yes.”
 You don’t have to look too closely to find the subtweet in that statement. USC and Arizona are the Pac-12 teams involved in the FBI probe, which accuses assistant coaches in both programs of funneling money to recruits or relatives of recruits. At Arizona, it was Emmanuel “Book” Richardson. At USC, it was Bland. Both are awaiting their hearing dates in court.
 Meanwhile, Bland’s alleged participation in the scheme could have lasting consequences for the USC basketball program, both present and future. This season, it has cost the Trojans perhaps their best all-around player in De’Anthony Melton, who has been held out of all 17 games this season due to his connection to the case. They have missed Melton, who is athletic and skilled offensively but can also play lockdown defense.
 For a Trojans’ season that has teetered back-and-forth, often in the wrong direction due to lack of consistency, Melton’s absence has loomed large. There is a #FreeDMelt movement — Melton’s sister started an online petition and his teammates and coach have been supportive. Junior forward Chimezie Metu was seen walking out of the locker room after USC’s loss at Stanford on Sunday wearing a t-shirt with that hashtag.
 But there’s nothing USC can do knowing it may have to forfeit any game Melton plays in if the NCAA later rules him ineligible. There’s also nothing the University can do about Taeshon Cherry, the other USC player reportedly named in the allegations. Cherry was a splash commit for Enfield, arguably USC’s best signing in a decade and a surefire headliner for next season. But, last month, he decommitted.
 To pit all the team’s problems on the corruption scandal would be too much. Surely, with a squad full of returning upperclassmen, a couple of potential NBA big men in Metu and fellow junior forward Bennie Boatwright, USC should be in a much better position than it is right now.
 Perhaps its first three losses — all nonconference — to Texas A&M, SMU and Oklahoma were understandable. But to fall to Princeton at home is inexcusable. To drop its conference opener to Washington — picked to finish second-to-last in the Pac-12 — is befuddling. And Sunday’s loss, where USC blew a 15-point second half lead and lost at Stanford on a game-winning shot from beyond halfcourt, was the cherry on top of a bitter sundae.
 It’s not like the team lacks  talent. And it’s not like they didn’t have the hype — the Trojans’ No. 10 ranking before the season was their highest preseason ranking since Watergate. Yet, USC’s RPI (rating percentage index) before Wednesday’s game against Colorado had dipped to 56th in the nation. As it stands, it’s questionable if this team would even qualify for the NCAA Tournament, much less fulfill the Final Four predictions that some experts placed upon Enfield’s squad.
 USC is struggling on the court with consistency, with closing out games, with staying focused for 40 minutes. And off the court, the Bland scandal might be taking its toll. After practice on Tuesday, Enfield prepared a statement for reporters on Boyle’s comments, which accused Boyle of not knowing all the facts. Enfield said he was “disappointed,” calling the jab “unfair” to the program.
 On one hand, Enfield was sticking up for his players, and that’s good. But in the same vein, the focus was not on the game — a conference game against Boyle’s Buffaloes that USC desperately needs: but instead on the scandal, a scandal that may come to define what has been a frustrating 2017-18 season for the Trojans.

USC alumni are sparking change by combining social impact with corporate gifting.

After spending years working in both nonprofit and corporate fields, USC alumna Laura Hertz launched Gifts for Good, a full-fledged social enterprise company which has already funded a year of drinking water for nearly 900 people in Central Africa.
“We’re all over the board in the types of impact that we’ve had, but it’s been super exciting to see what we can do, just by redirecting some of the dollars that people already spend for good,” Hertz said.
Founded in November by Hertz and fellow USC alumnus Jerry Eisenberg, the company focuses on providing corporations with gift options that give back to charitable causes. 
When Hertz worked with AmeriCorps, a federal national service program that supports people with critical needs, she witnessed firsthand the difficulties nonprofits frequently encountered with raising funding for their causes due to the fact that they rely heavily on donations and grants. 
When Hertz attended the Marshall School of Business for her master’s in Social Entrepreneurship, she was determined to maximize the sustainability of nonprofits and social enterprises by connecting them to a corporate gifting marketplace.
Gifts for Good functions by bringing products created by nonprofits and social enterprises to corporate clients through one e-commerce site. Shoppers can filter through gifts by marking which causes they support. The site features six main causes, including children in need, the environment, economic development, women at-risk, homelessness and health.
The concept behind the company became feasible when the pair took a course at Marshall. For the course final project, each team had to present a business concept that fused charitable work and business. Hertz and Eisenberg developed a plan to address the specific problems Hertz observed in her experience with the nonprofit and corporate worlds.
When Marshall professor Christine El-Haddad, who teaches both undergraduate and graduate strategy courses, listened to Hertz and Eisenberg’s presentation, she thought their plan was a good idea, but she never expected the project to turn into a company. 
A few months after the pair took the course, they notified El-Haddad that they had founded the company.
“From the first time I met [Hertz and Eisenberg] in class, I was impressed,” El-Haddad said. “If every business thought along those lines, the world would be a much better place … Now that two of my students have turned a final project into a company, I want every final project to turn into a company.”
Eisenberg said he wondered which charitable cause to support when he first enrolled in the Marshall program. However, his time in El-Haddad’s course made him realize he didn’t have to choose.
“Our concept was: Why support just one cause, when we could set up a business that would allow us to support a whole range of worthwhile causes, just by helping people pivot the way they purchase gifts?” Eisenberg said.
According to Hertz, since their recent launch in November, Gifts for Good has already attracted over a hundred clients and made a significant impact toward several causes.
“Many of our orders have been large-scale bulk orders from some of the world’s most well-known brands,” Hertz said. 
During their first four weeks in business, they were able to provide 450 days of job training for women transitioning out of homelessness in downtown Los Angeles, and 188 days of schooling for at-risk children in Honduras.
