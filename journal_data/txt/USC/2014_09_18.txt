The Undergraduate Student Government screened Sheryl Sandberg’s live discussion on her newest leadership empowerment campaign, Lean In, on Thursday in Taper Hall of Humanities.

Sheryl Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook and in 2013, she was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people in the world. Sandberg has also worked for Google in the past and is a board member of the Walt Disney Company, Women for Women International and the Center for Global Development.
In 2013, Sandberg published her book Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, which she based her campaign on. In the book, Sandberg examines why women are underrepresented in leadership roles both in business and government and offers solutions for women to become more engaged in the workplace.
“Lean In was founded because the world is still dominated by men, and it’s time to change that,” Sandberg said during the live discussion.
The foundation encourages the formation of small circles that consist of eight to 12 members who work to empower each other. Members meet regularly to grow and learn together. Through these circles, Sandberg hopes to spark awareness, skills and confidence in women.
Gabriella Visani, a freshman majoring in occupational therapy, said she attended because she was interested in learning more about female empowerment.
“When I was growing up, I did not think much of gender equality,” she said. “I did a lot of boyish things, and it was not until that I became more interested in feminine things that I started thinking about these issues. Now, I just want to do and know more about it.”
When Sandberg began her campaign, she believed that only 1,000 circles would be formed. As interest has increased, however, the foundation has grown to include 20,000 circles in the United States and across the world.
USG Vice President Rini Sampath is eager to start a Lean In circle at USC, which is why she hosted the event.
“Time is very ripe as more women come to power,” Sampath said. “Since USC is so diverse, it is a great place to start such a discussion.”
Hassaan Ebrahim, a senior majoring in neuroscience, said his family’s experiences sparked his interest in workplace equality.
“My mom is an electrical engineer who works for Apple and has been involved in the tech industry,” he said. “I know the type of challenges she has faced, and I want to get the conversation going.”
The Lean In campaign is not aimed exclusively at women. Sandberg emphasized that if gender equality is to be achieved, men also have to play a role. Ebrahim was the only male who attended the event, however.
Alana Victor, co-director of the USG External Affairs Committee, and Sampath are hoping that if they start a circle at USC, both men and women will work together to empower each other.
“It’s not just a women’s issue, but a human rights issue as well,” Victor said.

Since the start of the fall semester, the number of requests for Campus Cruiser, the university’s free ride service, has increased by 32 percent compared to the same period in 2013. Extended service boundaries and reduced wait times for cars have accounted for the high level of demand.
Buckle up · Campus Cruiser received 18,446 calls between Aug. 25 and Sept. 17, an increase of 4000 compared to the same period last year. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
In an email to the USC community on Aug. 25, President C. L. Max Nikias announced that Campus Cruiser would extend coverage to include the entire Dept. of Public Safety patrol and response area and would work to decrease maximum wait times to 15 minutes.
“There’s a wider boundary that Campus Cruiser covers now than what we had in the past,” Director of Transportation Tony Mazza said. “We’re picking up more students in terms of the demand, who are living further beyond where they used to live.”
Since Nikias introduced the new initiatives, Campus Cruiser has reduced 80 percent of wait times to 15 minutes or less. Mazza said that weekly demand for the service has skyrocketed as a result of improved wait times.
“As we analyze the numbers, the reason for [continued growth] is that as the wait times become less, the popularity of the program becomes greater,” Mazza said. “We drive the wait times down and more people want to use the program. So we’re chasing a number in some ways.”
From Aug. 25 to Sept. 17, Campus Cruiser received 18,446 calls, an increase of more than four thousand calls compared to the same period last year.
“Peak volume has moved to non-peak days and now the peak days are seeing exponentially higher numbers,” Associate Director of Guest Relations Michelle Garcia said.
In response to increased demand, Campus Cruiser expanded its staff from 125 to 154 student-drivers, added 13 cars to the fleet and cut down the driver-training program from two weeks to two days. With about 75 returning drivers, Campus Cruiser hired 80 new students during the first week of school.
“We have gone to an abbreviated training program trying to get this fast ramp-up to deal with the high demand,” Garcia said. “It was more in-depth before, and now we are just teaching the basics right up front.”
As Campus Cruiser scrambled to train new drivers early in the semester, DPS officers, Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) cadets and private valets assisted in transporting students on- and off-campus.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that more students know about Campus Cruiser as a result of the university’s efforts to improve security. He said that greater awareness of the service has encouraged the spike in demand.
“Students recognize that part of their responsibility is using the resources provided to them by the university to keep themselves safe,” Carry said.
While Campus Cruiser has received record numbers of requests, students have encountered inconsistencies in the quality of service.
Pooja Sinha, a freshman majoring in environmental engineering, estimated that she has tried to access Campus Cruiser 20 times, but has only received a car twice.
“It takes almost 10 to 15 minutes for them to pick up and sometimes there is no response at all,” Sinha said. “I find myself walking home or taking the tram because after 10 minutes of no response, I am left clueless.”
Fiona Li, a graduate student studying business analytics, has used the service twice, waiting 30 minutes each time for the driver to arrive.
“I think that the person who answered the phone was not so polite,” Li stated. “I also wonder if it’s a common situation or just happening to me. Because when the girl was so rude to me, I was scared to call that number again.”
After her negative experiences with Campus Cruiser, Li switched to using Uber, a ride-sharing app.
“When you have a bad experience, your mood can really go down,” Li said.
Arielle Fishman, a senior majoring in theatre, has noticed improvements in the service compared to last year.
“Last year, they’d forget about me and take much longer to come. This year has been better. I haven’t had any trouble,” Fishman said. “When I called they said that someone was en route, and the car arrived in five minutes.”
Fishman also didn’t have any issues to report with her driver.
“The drivers themselves are great, and I am thankful to them and the service that they give, but it does seem that they’re understaffed,” Fishman said.
Garcia said that she has been working to address non-responsiveness to calls. On Wednesday evening, Campus Cruiser launched a new phone system that notifies students of their place in line and offers a call-back feature if people do not want to stay on hold.
In addition to Campus Cruiser services, Carry said that the university is exploring various solutions and dealing with outside vendors to meet demand for Campus Cruiser services.
“The university is looking into innovative new ways to use technology to keep students safe,” Carry said.

On Sept. 18, USC hosted the 2nd Annual Southern California Lazarex Cancer Foundation Gala to honor former Los Angeles City Council Member William Rosendahl, the first recipient of the foundation’s Victory Award. Notable attendees included President C.L. Max Nikias, former California Gov. Gray Davis and Olympic gold medalist Charlie White.
Fighting on · Dana Dornsife, founder of the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, speaks at the organization’s second annual gala Thursday at Town and Gown. Dornsife’s brother-in-law, Mike Miller, was diagnosed with cancer. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
Rosendahl was diagnosed with cancer in 2012 and told he would die within a few months. He is still fighting, and has a message for those were given the same bleak news that he was.
“I would be very hopeful and excited because they’re coming up with all kinds of new strategies,” Rosendahl said. “I want them to realize that here I am, two-and-a-half years later, stronger now than I was two-and-a-half years ago, and that you have to be positive and you have to want to live.”
Grey Davis praised Rosendahl and the Lazarex Foundation for their support in fighting cancer.
“I don’t know anybody who brought more joy and more determination to overcome adversity than Bill Rosendahl,” he said. “The Lazarex organization is in the business of saving lives, and that’s exactly what they do. There is no better cause helping people deal with the end stage of cancer.”
When Dana Dornsife’s brother-in-law Mike Miller was diagnosed with cancer, it was the success of clinical trials that allowed him to live long enough so that his children would remember him. The experience inspired Dornsife to found the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, a one-of-a-kind nonprofit organization that links cancer patients with FDA-approved clinical trials and provides financial support for their treatment and travel costs. Dana Dornsife and her husband David are the namesakes of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“When you reach the point in your battle with cancer when your doctor sits across from you and says, ‘I’m sorry there is nothing more that can be done,’ that is when Lazarex steps in,” Dornsife told the Daily Trojan. “Your doctor may not have any more that they can do, but there are things that can be done.”
Dornsife, who worked with Miller to find clinical trials for his treatment, started getting calls from people he had connected with during his treatment, asking if she could share her experience with them.
But for some patients, getting to the clinical trials wasn’t easy.
“There was this whole buildup of hope, where they were thinking, ‘There really is so much out there for me.’” Dornsife said. “But they bar-none came back to me and said, ‘I can’t do that. I can’t afford it. I can’t make that financial commitment.’”
Dornsife was concerned that people were unable to afford potentially life-saving treatment.
“That is so morally and fundamentally wrong that these people who were just as loved by their family members were not going to be able to have the opportunity that Mike had because of the size of their checkbook,” she said.
And so, in 2006, the Lazarex Cancer Foundation was born.
Lazarex’s mission is to match cancer patients to FDA clinical trials and to cover travel costs for each patient and companion, a mission that has been successful in extending the lives of many battling  cancer. Even if patients can afford the treatments, Lazarex can help them navigate the confusing web of options to see which they best qualify for.
Dornsife discussed how the Lazarex Foundation not only hopes to help those in need of clinical trials, but also how the foundation hopes to radically change the future of cancer treatment, which she said isn’t focused enough on the importance of connecting patients to clinical trials.
“Every drug that we have available today is available as a result of completing a successful clinical trial,” Dornsife said. “Unless we are able to enroll and engage patients and complete that research loop by successfully completing a clinical trial, we’re not going to get new drugs, treatments or cures on the marketplace.”
Though research is important, Dornsife said, the overemphasis on research to cure cancer is misguided.
“The thing that I find very frustrating is that everybody talks about research, and we spend billions and billions of dollars [in] lab, but then when you go the bedside, the onus [of] finding out [about] and participating in a clinical trial is placed on the shoulders of the patient,” she said. “It doesn’t make any sense.”
Dornsife said that though Lazarex will never be able to afford to help all cancer patients, she hopes the program will inspire changes in the way cancer is treated. The foundation has developed a partnership called Improved Patient Access to Clinical Trials with organizations such as the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center to support clinical trials, educate the community and urge physicians to make them a bigger part of their treatment plans.
Dornsife says the ultimate goal is for people not to need the foundation for assistance, and to reach a world where clinical trials are so widely used and funded that Lazarex doesn’t have to step in.
“That’s the ultimate vision,” she said. “To put myself out of business.”

What a whirlwind it’s been so far for USC’s 2014-15 football team.
A player (and captain nonetheless) sprained his ankles and lied about the cause before another player quit the team, alleging head coach Steve Sarkisian was racist. USC’s athletic director was fined for trotting down to the sidelines at Stanford, and then Boston College showed them up on a national stage.
As someone muttered in the press box after the BC loss, “USC can’t have one easy season.”
So the bye this week really comes at a good time for the Trojan football team. Through just three games this year, those student-athletes have endured more scrutiny and media attention than some other teams across the country will all season.
Lucky for them, they get a break — a chance to step out of the spotlight. And that break presents all of the other teams here at USC with an opportunity to shine.
Students, allow me to direct your attention to our women’s volleyball, women’s soccer and men’s water polo teams in competition this weekend.
Today, USC’s undefeated women’s soccer team hosts Arkansas-Pine Bluff at McAlister Field at 3 p.m. If you haven’t been following along all season (I can’t imagine why), let me bring you up to date.
A year removed from going 8-10-2 on the season, which led to the firing of former head coach Ali Khosroshahin, the No. 15 Women of Troy (5-0-2) are off to a hot start.
Under new head coach Keidane McAlpine, they’ve outscored their opponents by a combined 19-5 score through seven games (including an 8-1 walloping of UC Riverside).
After (hopefully) dispatching of the one-win Arkansas-Pine Bluff Lions today, the Women of Troy will host Pepperdine in their last non-conference game before starting Pac-12 play.
The 12th-ranked Waves will present a formidable challenge for the Women of Troy on Sunday afternoon, and that game — which will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks at 3:30 p.m. if you can’t make it out — is sure to be a close one.
USC’s women’s volleyball team will also be competing this weekend in Seattle. The Women of Troy opened up the season with six straight wins, but much like the football team, suffered a shocking weekend, losing to Texas A&M and Florida.
USC’s women’s volleyball team lost 3-1 against No. 4 Wisconsin last night, but will face off against Maryland at 5:30 p.m. today on the Pac-12 Networks, and the team is sure to play with a chip on its shoulder and bounce back from three straight losses.
Then there’s the legendary USC men’s water polo team. The Trojans, who are ranked third in the nation behind Stanford and UCLA despite winning the last six consecutive national championships and starting this season 8-0, are playing in the Kap7 (no, Colin Kaepernick is not sponsoring a water polo tournament) NorCal Classic in Stockton, California.
The Trojan water polo squad, led by head coach Jovan Vavic, will face some steep competition in the tournament this weekend.
Even USC’s women’s cross country team competes this weekend. Yes, USC has a women’s cross country team, and this weekend they’ll be running in Santa Clarita, California.
I told myself that I was glad USC didn’t have a football game this Saturday so that I could watch the other big games all day, but let’s be honest, there are no big games this weekend.
No. 1 Florida State takes on No. 22 Clemson without Jameis Winston for a half, but I have a hard time believing that will make any difference. Eastern Michigan at No. 11 Michigan State? Don’t care. Troy at No. 13 Georgia? Don’t care. Florida at No. 3 Alabama? I care a teeny tiny bit.
With the uninspiring college football schedule this weekend, there’s no good excuse not to pay attention to the other Trojan student-athletes in action, home and away.
Show up, tune in, incessantly check Twitter — do whatever you can to show your support.

The Trojans ended their bye week on a spirited note, as the team held its annual “Scout Bowl” on Thursday, spotlighting primarily second- and third-string players.
Captain to coach · Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard served as one of the team coaches at USC’s “Scout Bowl” during Friday’s practice. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Starters switched roles with developmental players and a couple players became coaches.
Team captains redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler and senior linebacker Hayes Pullard called the plays on their respective sides of the ball for the final period of practice, which included a scrimmage.
Lt. Dan Crawls 
The Trojans came out energized to play and support their teammates on Thursday, which is something head coach Steve Sarkisian continues to preach.
“Their competitive spirit is the one we have to have every day in every period for us to continue to get better,” Sarkisian said. “Every one of those plays, even in a walkthrough, is a championship play.”
Pullard and the defense emerged victorious, so the offense had to perform “Lt. Dan Crawls,” named after the character in the film Forrest Gump.
It was an entertaining end to a week in which the team focused primarily on correcting its mistakes during last Saturday’s loss to Boston College.
“I thought our guys gradually got better throughout the week,” Sarkisan said. “We were playing for something, kept everyone involved, and it’s good to see young guys get the opportunity.”
Staying Out of Trouble 
With the Trojans not having a game on Saturday, this is truly the first three-day weekend for the players, so Sarkisian made sure to address his players before closing out practice on Thursday.
“I told them to make great decisions, and I’m not naive to the fact that it’s a Thursday night on a college campus,” Sarkisian said.
Amid the recent Josh Shaw scandal and public relations debacle, Sarkisian believes that his “113 sons” are in a good frame of mind and have learned from the mistakes of others.
At least, he hopes so.
“I’m going to have my phone on all weekend and the goal is not to have that thing ring,” Sarkisian said.
Recruiting Updates 
The bye week has given the coaching staff some time to scout out the Friday Night Lights and recruit, which is what Sarkisian and his staff will be up to this three-day weekend.
Sarkisian mentioned that a lot of the coaching staff wasn’t present at practice on Thursday because they were “chomping at the bit” to get on the road.
He added that the recruiting class is balanced and that he feels like people have a pretty good idea of the style that the Trojans are going to play on the field.
It was also officially announced that 2015 quarterback Ricky Town, linebacker Cameron Smith and offensive lineman Chima Edoga had all been signed to financial aid agreements.
Sarkisian compared Town to Kessler, asserting that they are both students of the game and football junkies.
Injury Report 
Redshirt junior defensive end Greg Townsend Jr., who was battling illness, will be ready to get back on the field next week, Sarkisian said.
The same could not be said for redshirt junior running back Tre Madden or senior linebacker Lamar Dawson, who were not completely ruled out by Sarkisian, but declared doubtful to play in next Saturday’s game against Oregon State.
The team will be back on Howard Jones Field next week for what Sarkisian is calling a “Bonus Monday” practice to prepare for the Beavers.

After opening the 2014 campaign with eight straight victories, the undefeated USC men’s water polo team will look to gain momentum this weekend at the Kap7 NorCal Classic before running the gauntlet in conference play next month.
Goal-asaurus Rex · Driver Rex Butler, one of only four seniors on this year’s men’s water polo team, has 12 goals in eight games this season. The Coronado, California native has four multi-goal games this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Coming off sweeps of the first two tournaments of the season, the six-time defending national champion Trojans will attempt to repeat their performance in Stockton, California, where they play Air Force, whom they defeated 25-7 Sept. 14 at the Inland Empire Classic, and either No. 7 UC Santa Barbara or No. 12 Loyola Marymount Sept. 20, with the semifinals and finals of the elimination-style tournament taking place Sept. 21.
If able to advance to Sunday’s games, the squad could get an early look at the likes of rivals No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 California.
With the team set to face LMU, UCSB, Stanford, UCLA and Cal when official Mountain Pacific Sports Federation competition gets under way starting Sept. 27, senior driver Kostas Genidounias believes this weekend’s conference prelude will be crucial for the Trojans.
“This tournament is, in my opinion, the most important one of the year,” Genidounias said. “It’s when the tough games start, and it’s when you set the tone [for conference play].”
Following the Trojans’ victory over Air Force last weekend, the Falcons will enter the rematch at 4-5 on the season.
LMU and UCSB come into the weekend with records of 1-4 and 5-1, respectively. Stanford, UCLA and Cal are all undefeated this season at 3-0, 8-0 and 5-0, respectively.
“The preparation that everyone’s put in, all the hard work — it’s showing,” freshman two-meter Lachlan Edwards said. “There’s definitely a lot of talent in this team. We’re a young team, but if we all understand how to play together, I think we’ve got the best team in the NCAA.”
As the tournament approaches, however, head coach Jovan Vavic is not resting on his laurels. The 12-time National Coach of the Year continues to emphasize the importance of getting better over all else.
“The first thing is to really worry about the first games and then the big games,” Vavic said. “We’re focusing really on getting better each game and improving in every game. If we lose a game here and there, it’s part of the learning experience. Last season we lost four games and won a national championship — with all the experience we had last year, we still lost four games. The most important thing is to play our best water polo at the end when it counts the most.”
Having netted a team-high 25 goals thus far in 2014, Genidounias leads a Trojan frontline that has outscored its opponents by a combined total of 170-37 through eight games.
The Trojan attackers will hope to continue finding the back of the net as much as possible this weekend, as they might match up against other top scorers such as Cal’s Aleksa Sapjonic. The team’s triple-digit goal difference has come by making a good defense into the best offense, the veteran Genidounias believes.
“We’ve been playing some really good defense, not allowing too many goals,” Genidounias said. “We have a great goalie in the cage, [freshman] McQuin [Baron], and our secondary goalie [freshman] Ben [Goncharenko] — they’ve been doing a great job. Like [Vavic] likes to say, if we take care of the defense, the offense comes by itself — and we’ve been scoring a lot of goals, so I think that’s been the key to our victories so far.”
Genidounias, a three-time national champion, is confident that this year’s freshman-heavy Trojan team will have the upper hand against fellow powerhouses Stanford, UCLA and California when the time comes.
“What we have that [teams such as Stanford, UCLA and Cal] don’t have is that we know how to win at the end of the season,” Genidounias said. “We’ve been winning championships for six years now, so the difference is that we have some seniors and juniors who have actually won championships that know what it takes, and other teams don’t have that. It’s really important for us, the upperclassmen, to show the guys what it takes.”

From the ferocious Birthday Party concerts of the 1970s and ’80s to the release of last year’s soothingly sorrowful Bad Seeds album Push the Sky Away, Nick Cave has always been an artist whose work defies easy categorization.
Cave man · The new film 20,000 Days on Earth presents a fictionalized day in the life of post-punk musician Nick Cave. It deliberately plays with fan expectations creating an artisitic whirlwind of a film. – Photo courtesy of Drafthouse Films
 
The Australian rocker’s fearsome appearance — think Elvis Presley reincarnated as a fire-breathing, Goth-punk troubadour with a voice so deep it’s practically bottomless — belies an incredibly eclectic range of influences: the puckish poetry of Leonard Cohen, the soul-baring ballads of Nina Simone, the death-haunted last testaments of Johnny Cash. His lyrics suffused with a heady brew of the sacred and profane, Nick Cave can transform himself from lecherous lounge lizard to sulfur-tongued preacher over the course of a single song.
Cave, a notoriously elusive presence offstage, would at first seem an unlikely subject for a documentary. Thankfully, the new film 20,000 Days on Earth, now playing in select theaters, isn’t interested in simply venerating him, dissecting his creative process or even peering into his private life as a family man and recovering heroin addict. Instead, the movie, helmed by first-time feature directors Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard and featuring scenes scripted by Cave himself, ambitiously blends fact and fiction to form a freewheeling, hallucinatory account of the musician’s twenty-thousandth day of life, the same day he began recording Push the Sky Away. The end result is simultaneously an extension of Cave’s own self-styled mythology, a daring exploration of the limits of artistic control and a fluid meditation on memory’s ability to imbue existence with the semblance of meaning.
While 20,000 Days on Earth’s approach is certainly unique, it’s hardly the first documentary to use the power of cinema as a way to inflate the legend of a particular musician. Richard Lester’s 1964 classic A Hard Day’s Night purported to be an average week in the lives of the Beatles, following the Fab Four from their hometown of Liverpool to a televised gig in London. Released at the height of Beatlemania, the movie was responsible for popularizing the character traits of the group’s individual members — Paul is the cute one! Ringo is the funny one! — and continues to influence the way certain bands are packaged to this day. The most memorable element, aside from the songs of course, is Paul’s “very clean” fictional grandfather, played by Irish character actor Wilfrid Brambell.
D.A. Pennebaker’s Dont Look Back [sic], arguably the first true “rockumentary,” followed Bob Dylan on his 1965 U.K. concert tour and featured a raw, unfiltered look at the legend in his cool, charismatic prime, as well as his occasionally fraught interactions with then-girlfriend Joan Baez, former Animals keyboardist Alan Price, fellow folk singer Donovan (his friendly competition with Dylan is a powerful reminder of the difference between talent and genius) and a small army of hangers-on. The film is also notable for its iconic opening scene, which finds Dylan crafting the music video for “Subterranean Homesick Blues” — the earliest of its kind — with the aid of Beat generation guru Allen Ginsberg and several dozen cue cards. Today Dont Look Back is rightly considered the benchmark by which all other rock docs are forever judged.
Other documentaries have been far less kind to their subjects, choosing instead to wallow in the pettiness and jealousy the rock star lifestyle often breeds. Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky’s Metallica: Some Kind of Monster revolves around the members of Metallica in the turbulent months leading up to the release of their 2003 album St. Anger. The movie is a fascinatingly candid depiction of a once great band brought low by a toxic combination of in-fighting and creative exhaustion in the wake of the abrupt departure of bassist Jason Newsted and lead singer James Hetfield’s struggles with alcoholism.
20,000 Days on Earth, which won awards for directing and editing at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, deliberately plays with audience expectations for this type of movie, interspersing Push the Sky Away rehearsal footage with enigmatic conversations about weather diaries and ghostly visitations from the likes of actor Ray Winstone and pop star Kylie Minogue, the latter of whom collaborated with Cave on the 1995 hit “Where the Wild Roses Grow.”
All these esoteric nods make sense when you consider the musician’s previous dalliances with film. In addition to a wonderfully weird cameo in Wim Wenders’s Wings of Desire and composing the original scores for John Hillcoat’s The Road and Andrew Dominik’s The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford with his Bad Seeds bandmate Warren Ellis, the multitalented Cave also penned the screenplays for Hillcoat’s The Proposition, quite possibly the greatest western of the past two decades, and the engaging but uneven 2012 bootlegging drama Lawless.
20,000 Days on Earth isn’t a documentary so much as a mystical reverie centered on the life of the creative mind, the cinematic walkabout of an artist determined to take control of his celebrity before it takes control of him. As Cave himself observed during a recent interview with Rolling Stone, “The more attention you absorb, the more monstrous you become.”

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s new Art+Film exhibit; “Haunted Screens: German Cinema in the 1920s,” opens Sept. 21. The exhibit transports visitors into the highly influential era of German Expressionism just in time for the centennial anniversary of World War I.

“Haunted Screens” showcases the dual worlds of filmmaking and film content through a curated collection of production design drawings, photographs, posters, documents and equipment, as well as the shadowy worlds of the films themselves. The stylistically striking show is located in the Art of the Americas Building, which previously housed the Stanley Kubrick and Gabriel Figueroa exhibits.
German Expressionism, as expressed in silent film, was an artistic movement that took place during the Weimar era, a liberal period in the interwar years, and extended the early 1900s Expressionist movements involving literature and visual, auditory and kinetic arts. The wave of German émigré directors, cinematographers and production designers brought this background to Hollywood, where its imprints still resonate in the noir, sci-fi and horror genres.
The exhibit, like the filmmaking industry, is a collaborative effort. USC architecture professor Amy Murphy, a professor at the USC School of Architecture, partnered on the design of the exhibit with her husband Michael Maltzan. Murphy was hired for the project through a Trojan connection — a student who was in the first USC studio class she taught, Victoria Behner. Behner is the senior exhibit designer at LACMA and a lecturer at the USC School of Architecture .
“[Expressionist films] can’t exist without the concepts about the city at that time, but they relate to how we think about cities today … the anxieties but also some of the pleasures of urban life,” Murphy said. This psychological oscillation is a battle between control and repression, freedom and expression. It is physically expressed through spatial design that distorts reality in the films and the exhibition space. The design team constructed the space in the dramatically curved shape of a waving carpet to allow the two realms to be next each other and also to respect the need of film to stay in that dark dream space. The top of the carpet is all white, and the bottom of the carpet makes dark tunnels.
In these tunnels, small, suspended screens cycle clips from films including Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), the Crime and Punishment-inspired Raskolnikow (1923) and F.W. Murnau’s Faust (1926). The distorted camera angles and slanted set designs run parallel to the geometrically angled walls of the tunnel. The screens are double-sided so that the film can be viewed from both sides of the screen but backwards, a further distortion of reality.
Murphy still teaches these Expressionist films every year in her course ARCH 434:  City Cine: Visuality, Media and Urban Experience. Last week, the class screened Fritz Lang’s crime thriller M (1931), one of the featured films in the exhibition. The class then discussed the kinetic feeling and the paranoia of cities and related it to life on campus.
Within the exhibit, the viewer is free to wander or take a preplanned route. “While the exuberant forms are in many ways what you’re known for as an architect, it’s really the quality of the space, the feeling or the type of the space, that has the biggest and lasting effect,” Maltzan said.
In other respect, the exhibit is like a Mobius strip — the dark spaces lead back into the light — and there is a curious weaving movement through the two worlds, mirroring the looping temporal and narrative structures in the films. “You always have an idea about the path you’d like someone to take, but the reality is that, like in life, people have both the opportunity and the predilection to take their own route,” Maltzan said.
Throughout the exhibit, details are sprinkled in with a wink and a nudge. A jagged corridor serves to house a series of drawings with the motif of stairs. The robot from Lang’s science fiction epic Metropolis (1927) looks down upon its audience, self-consciously regarding a poster depicting an image of itself. Behind the robot, a small cubby replicates the chiaroscuro lighting effects so common in Expressionist cinema.
The nearly 250 works come from the collections of LACMA’s Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies, the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and La Cinémathèque française, where this exhibit was held a few years ago, and private collections. The Paris exhibit inspired LACMA CEO Michael Govan to bring the show to Los Angeles. This exhibit is supported by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and film producer Riza Aziz.
Many of the drawings, manuscripts, posters and set models were collected by Lotte Eisner, a German émigré film historian who wrote The Haunted Screen in 1952. This fall, LACMA and the Skirball Cultural Center are working with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to present three exhibitions on German Expressionist cinema, one of which is “Haunted Screens,” which will be joined later by “Light & Noir: Exiles and Émigrés in Hollywood, 1933–1950,” and “The Noir Effect.”

Last week, a 25-year-old woman emerged from three years of captivity. She had not been allowed to cut her fingernails, wash her hair, or eat anything but occasional leftovers. She was not even allowed to see any family. including her three-year-old daughter.
To an American ear, those shocking statements might sound like the opening lines of a Criminal Minds episode. Seema Kumari, the officer in charge at the women’s police station near Darbhanga, India knew exactly what had transpired.
“It was as if her in-laws were seeking revenge for not bringing ample dowry and for giving birth to a girl child,” Kumari said.
In other words, these in-laws believed that providing their son with love and a baby girl was not enough. If this new mom couldn’t cough up dowry money or give her husband a son, she needed to be locked up.
Dowries aren’t new to Indian culture, though they were initially more similar to an inheritance. Payments come in either cash or more lavish gifts, like cars and home appliances. Some Indian families find themselves spending years of wages or selling anything they can to pay off their daughters’ dowries. The cost of finding a suitable husband for these girls is most assuredly not just an emotional one.
What’s new to Indian culture, however, is increased violence surrounding dowries. Though parliament passed an act in 1961 to make dowries illegal altogether, the law was, and still is, largely ignored. A study by India’s National Crime Records Bureau reported that “dowry deaths” were up 3 percent in 2012 from the previous five years, according to the Los Angeles Times. In 2013, reported dowry deaths totaled to over eight thousand. Unfortunately, analysts believe these numbers aren’t a true representation of the whole picture; parents frequently don’t take action out of fear that the men in the community would not marry their other daughters or that starting trouble would taint their family’s honor.
These problems might sound a bit “third-world.” They might sound like something that would never occur in American culture — that we “just wouldn’t do that here.” But if that were the case, the American Psychological Association would not report that on average in the United States, three or more women die at the hands of their significant others every day.
The unfortunate truth is that misogyny is alive and well across the globe. There are only two real differences between dowry deaths and American domestic violence.
First, it’s easy to label “dowry deaths” as just that: deaths due to the social construct of dowries. Nobody has to call the abusers and murderers “misogynistic” — they’re just angry people who didn’t get their money’s worth.
Second, in the United States, there’s a functioning criminal justice system that for the most part supports victims and jails offenders. In India, even the Supreme Court recognizes that the justice system caters to the rich.
“I can say it on oath that we are not devoting even 5 percent of our time for the common man,” Justice B.S. Chauhan said last month  about the case of college student Ishrat Jahan’s killing. “[The] Supreme Court has become a safe haven for the criminals.” It’s no wonder that women in India don’t even bother reporting their offenders — their cases will never be heard.
Current campaigns to raise awareness have led some couples to use simple marriage contracts and have given a few men and women the courage to speak up against dowries, according to The Daily Beast. The problem, however, is too pervasive to be solved by simply raising awareness. Major adjustments in the Indian justice system and societal mindset must be made to save these women.
This Indian woman’s story is not a Criminal Minds episode. And though a dowry is part of it, this is not really the story of angry in-laws who were robbed of what they deserved. It’s a story of sexism. Though it is helpful to consider sexism in every cultural context, the important thing to remember is that this victim was just a twenty-something mom. Every mother, daughter and sister deserves a culture and a justice system where they can be safe and female at the same time.
I dont understand why americans are so much worried about indian women alive or dead.
Because their plight is a major issue, not just in India but worldwide. Every major news outlet in the world has done some pieces on this problem. Rather than appreciating the article for bringing to light a major issue, you’re only concerned with the fact that it appears in an American university publication.
Oh really do u think every case is a dowry death? Do u even know about these:

In 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that the average woman earns 78 percent of what a man makes despite working a similar full-time job, and Senate Republicans simply don’t care.
Andrea Wijaya | Daily Trojan
 
On Monday, Republican Senators unanimously rejected the Paycheck Fairness Act, a piece of legislation that attempts to fix the gap between money women and men make for the same amount of effort and time on the job.
It is the third time Republicans have rejected the law in two years. The only people in this country who deserve less pay — if any at all — for equal amounts of work are politicians who consider it their “work” to systematically endorse the oppression of women. For the rest of America, it is time to end the vicious gender discrimination that has plagued this country for 200 years too long.
The Paycheck Fairness Act includes several amendments to the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act that include, according to Politico, “offering training for salary negotiations, increasing employees’ legal options for fighting pay disparities and prohibiting retaliation against employees seeking salary information.” According to the legislative summary, the bill also — heaven forbid — “makes employers who violate sex discrimination prohibitions liable in a civil action for either compensatory or (except for the federal government) punitive damages.”
Without these important protections, it is no wonder that the pay gap hasn’t closed at all since 2007. It is also a shame.
One objection, advanced by Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) (who voted against the bill) is that the bill could potentially outlaw merit-based pay, which rewards employees based on individual performance. But that objection is unfounded — if an employer’s idea of merit pay is one that rewards men more than it rewards women, that isn’t merit pay — it’s gender discrimination. If an employer’s idea of merit pay is one that rewards men and women equally for good performance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would have no problem with it.
Some Republicans preferred to direct the issue to something different entirely.
“It’s politics,” said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE), another Republican woman who didn’t vote for the bill. “It’s a one-sided vote for political reasons, so [Democrats] can use it in campaigns.”
That’s a C+ argument. Sure, it’s midterm season, but here is the awkward moment when Republicans need to be reminded that this is the third time they’ve rejected the bill in two years. Last April, when there was nigh an election in sight, Republicans didn’t even allow the bill to be debated. This time, they allowed the bill to come to the floor for debate before rejecting it — but only because the vote prevented the minimum wage bill and other progressive pieces of legislation from being debated. In fact, Republicans are so shortsighted in this case that they don’t even realize that just voting for the bill in bipartisan fashion would only have a negligible political influence on the midterms because both parties could take credit for it.
Republicans also tried to wish away the issue by invoking the “small business” excuse, an old standby.
“I think this bill would result in excessive litigation that would impose a real burden, particularly on small businesses,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who also didn’t vote for the bill. “I think existing laws are adequate,” Collins told the Huffington Post.
Arguments like this are the reason most conservative Americans are afraid to sneeze for fear of disturbing the sacred institution of “small businesses.” Granted, some regulation is good regulation. Laws that allow someone to sue an employer if the roof falls on top of them at work also impose a “burden” on small businesses: they have to build roofs that won’t collapse on their workers. Laws that burden small businesses with the task of paying their women workers the same as their men workers are justifiable burdens indeed.
The Paycheck Fairness Act is a particular piece of politics that is too important to be left to politicians. While women are working equal time for less pay this fall, Congress will be on recess campaigning. Unfortunately, Republicans will be campaigning without the support of half of the electorate.
 
Nathaniel Haas is a junior majoring in political science and economics. His column, “State of the Union,” runs Fridays. 
 
Research the “Equal Pay Act of 1963”.  It’s very first clause mandates equal pay by gender.  So why a redundant re-run?  Because the so called “paycheck fairness act” has two key elements: 1) it provides political fodder to push a bogus ‘war on women’ and 2) it rewards the trial lawyers who are in bed with the Democrats.  
Read the Equal Pay Act and learn the truth on this time wasting political theatre.
so – my civil and helpful comment from earlier today was – deleted? Really?
Nathaniel, I enjoyed the article but perhaps i can share that the bill was broader than just the pay equality for women, it also had a clause that would protect employees who shared salary information from punishment. My problem with that clause is that employees should not be share salary information as it can create a culture of jealousy envy, and strife. Having worked for a fortune 500 company and in Higher education i can attest to the problems public salary information can cause. While I agree something should be done to better align women’s salary rights with men’s I believe there are better ways to legislate this and this bill was (probably) not one of them. For the sake of clarity, I know one (albeit old) argument that was used as justification was that companies would assign a financial value to maternity leave. Having a maternity package + salary would equate to equal pay. The obvious problem with this view is that not all women take or use maternity leave and therefore is actually a fringe benefit that results in a lower overall pay for women. I want to be clear that i dont agree with that argument but from an HR/Payroll perspective i see how they rationalized it. I’ve also seen (glanced over) the other iterations of this bill and neither to me is sufficient. I understand that this is an opinion piece but i believe saying the “GOP is wrong to deny women equal pay” is a bit unfair dont you think?
