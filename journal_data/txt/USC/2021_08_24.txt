When Carolyn “Caro” Knapp was five, her parents entered her into a mock film festival. The first film she entered followed the journey of a fairy princess played by Knapp herself. The entry would launch a series of productions that would continue throughout her elementary school career. With each work, Knapp grew more fond of story-telling, expanding the magnitude of the production by increasingly involving friends and family. By the time she entered middle school, Knapp knew she wanted to be a director.
Fast forward to 2020, Knapp embarked on another creative mission — becoming an animator. Now, in 2021 as a USC senior, she’s reaping the benefits.
Knapp’s experiences in quarantine did look a bit like everyone else’s — she fully converted from a TikTok skeptic to a video creator on the platform. She grew a quick appreciation for Olivia Rodrigo, albeit for her own, cooler reasons. And while quarantining at home in Southern California, the cinema and media studies major enlisted her brother’s help in learning animation. 
Before the coronavirus pandemic, Knapp spent most of her sophomore year video-graphing concerts for Universal Music Group’s internal creative solutions team, °1824. When quarantine upended that role, her only solution was to pivot to a medium that could be completed remotely — something that the versatile artist — painter, writer, ceramicist, filmmaker — didn’t find very difficult to do.
“I had a really strong 2D art background and a really strong film background, so it made sense to combine those things,” Knapp said. “It was a really unique opportunity because I knew that, [through °1824], I was going to get paid to try it.”
Through °1824, she took on animation projects for Fergie and — most famously — Olivia Rodrigo. She also designed Tinder billboards through her own freelance efforts.
While Knapp is most known for these larger projects, her major entry into the world of animation was through a visualizer for Maya B’s “Sink” in June 2020. The lesser-known video caught the eyes of Fergie’s team who reached out to Knapp to work on an animated visualizer for her song, “London Bridge.”
“That was really a turning point for me because that was when I started working with a lot bigger artists,” Knapp said.
One of those bigger artists was rising pop-princess Olivia Rodrigo who Knapp had the opportunity to design Spotify canvases — the looping images that play as you stream a song — for her “Sour” album. She shared the assignment with Chapman graduate Anya Salmen, her colleague at °1824.
Before Salmen joined °1824, the two contacted each other on TikTok. After a few FaceTimes, they realized just how compatible they were as creators.
“We had followed each other on Instagram before I even joined °1824. Before I was officially hired, I actually reached out to her and we FaceTimed and totally clicked,” Salmen said. “We have super similar styles. She had found me on TikTok, and I had just seen her collages and stuff.”
The pair’s styles were eerily compatible with Rodrigo’s artistic vision. It was a no-brainer that the duo would take on her projects together. 
“We had the crazy opportunity to pitch a few ideas to her management, and they ended up getting picked up,” Salmen said. “Since then we’ve been able to do a bunch of stuff with her … [Knapp] is my favorite person to work with on the team because … we work together super well.”
Salmen and Knapp’s close friend Graham Byers both attest to Knapp’s ability to complete the toughest jobs efficiently. Whether she’s with her animating partner or on-set, Knapp’s work ethic bleeds into her partners’ morale.
“The films we’ve worked on together have been so run-and-gun and so tight that it’s actually bred some really interesting work habits,” Byers, a senior majoring in film and television production, said. “I feel like I’ve become much more efficient as a director of photography because of it.”
Still, Knapp doesn’t believe in tunnel vision levels of isolation to accomplish these feats. Her work reflects her attention to the world around her, whether it’s a personal project or an assignment.
The Spotify canvases Knapp and Salmen produced are the perfect example of the pair’s roots in collage work and Knapp’s inspiration by her household items and textures around her. The canvas for “1 step forward, 3 steps back” features Knapp’s own beat-up converse. The visual artist searched through her room for a pair of high school sneakers that she then wrote on and scanned for the visuals, according to Buyers.
“I’ll scan or take photos of my clothes and different textures that I find places,” Knapp said. “I’m like, ‘Oh, that would make a good texture.’ Then I’ll cut objects and shapes and stuff out of those textures, which creates a really unique depth full style.”
Knapp stayed most true to this process for Fergie’s “London Bridge” video in which every visual was physically scanned by Knapp, resulting in the layered images we see on screen.
Shortly after the drop of the Fergie video, a work much more personal to Knapp gained recognition — her short film, “Cherry Bomb.” Principal character Georgie struggles to prove her sexuality after already coming out, and the narrative is largely inspired by Knapp’s own experiences as a freshman living in the “very heteronormative” freshman dorm, New North Residential College.
“Exiting that environment the summer after my freshman year, I had a whole other self-identity crisis,” Knapp, who identifies as bisexual, said.
After wrapping “Cherry Bomb,” Knapp decided to post a clip of the film on TikTok. The short video was embraced by thousands of LGBTQ+ people who resonated with her story.
“‘Cherry Bomb’ ended up coming out in October 2020, and I was able to promote that on TikTok using queer TikTok, which is something I never thought that I would ever get into at all,” Knapp said. “I used to be such a big TikTok hater. But that gave me a pretty good platform for [promoting the film].”
The mere ten seconds of “Cherry Bomb’s” unfinished cut was enough to launch the short into virality. The clip now has over 200,000 likes with many users returning to compliment the cinematography and lighting after watching the finished cut. 
“It wasn’t even a trailer yet. I just took the first 10 seconds,” Knapp said. “It was just myself on the green screen being like, ‘Hey, I’m a young director … this is the first 10 seconds of my short film.’ And it just started going. I don’t know how or why.”
While promotion is an important part of Knapp’s success, the quality of her projects is largely due to her work ethic, dedication to character building and collaborative spirit. 
Her narratives reflect a commitment to in-depth character study, and her on-set persona isn’t just vibrant and warm but systematic.
When asked why she got into filmmaking, she said “because of the characters.” Knapp is not just speaking of the boldened names on a screenplay. Those are important and very real to her, but her heart lies with the people she brings to set.
Whether it’s a fairytale written in childhood, a vulnerable exploration of self-identity or a pop-princess’s album work, Knapp has mastered bringing characters to life, no matter the medium. Much of it is simply about learning from the supporters championing your work, but the rest is realizing that people are not just the words they speak or the past that shapes them. They’re the community that provides a home for them, the doodles lazily drawn and redrawn in their notebooks, even the worn-out shoes in the corner of their closet. With this foundation, the jack-of-all-trades, is ready to conquer the film industry with bona fide multimedia experience.
“I’m very much an ideas-person and a [leader]. That’s where I thrive,” said Knapp. “Working alone in a room at my computer, that’s not a sustainable career for me. That’s what I’ve learned in quarantine. But I’m thankful that I’m in this place where, now, I can do both, so that in the future, I have that experience so that I can do anything and combine all the different mediums.”

The Daily Trojan review of Lorde’s second studio album, “Melodrama” — released in June 2017 — ended on a now humorous line of lighthearted dread: “Hopefully, it doesn’t take Lorde another four years to release an album.” 
It was a noble hope, but four years have certainly passed. Patient fans waited and yearned, and were finally given “Solar Power,” which was released last Friday.
An immediate energy of jubilance and the carefree excitement of a perfect summer preceded the album, when the titular track was released as a single alongside an album cover that promotes pure, naked enjoyment (literally).
However, when taken in its whole, “Solar Power” exceeds the simplicity of the windows down, soul-lifting vibrancy it initially teased. Deeply reflective of times both passed and coming, the album sings of gratefulness, mourns youthful mistakes, appreciates nature and fears for it. 
In a departure from her typical, distinctly pop sound, Lorde and producer Jack Antonoff use organic instrumentation and wistful lyricism to encompass the uncertainty of aging in a world that itself inches into a new and undetermined era of existence. 
Leaving behind the electronic style of Lorde’s first two albums of thrills and partying, “Solar Power” invites us to pursue peace and wellness over acoustic guitars and calming rhythmic drums. Riddled with hyper specific allusions to Lorde’s own life as well as abstract musings on the state of nature, “Solar Power” captures an attempt to be well in the face of both our intimate, personal struggles and a world threatened by climate change.
As with Lorde’s previous work, the music is hypnotic, drawing you into her words as if everything she sings holds a hidden answer. Lorde, however, makes it clear in the first track that she doesn’t want to be the answer holder any longer.
In “The Path,” Lorde’s lyrics read, “If you’re looking for a savior, well, that’s not me.” The song alludes to Lorde’s own struggles, dismantling the worship of celebrities by insisting that we all hurt; no one knows the answers, not even Lorde. 
Though insisting she can’t save us, Lorde still manages to share her best advice, encouraging the search for wellness in the natural world. A reverence for sun, water and earth is prevalent throughout the entire album, reflective of her home country, New Zealand. 
Though the album encourages healing and happiness through appreciation of the world, there are inevitable moments of mournfulness for the lovely bits of nature that deteriorate around us.
In “Leader of a New Regime,” Lorde imagines a time in the future where we’ll have to pack our bags full of SPF 3000 and escape to the natural sanctuaries of the world to begin again. At a minute and a half long, the song serves as an interlude, lending to the feeling of fleeting thoughts we have throughout our days in this climate crisis era. 
Lorde takes a more serious tone on existentialism in “Fallen Fruit,” where she bemoans being left to a world destroyed by previous generations. The song’s ethereal tone invites existential thought, especially coupled with Lorde’s nearly whispered declaration, “It’s time for us to leave.” 
At its halfway point, the song also features the album’s only use of an 808 drum, the electronic sound used abundantly in Lorde’s earlier work. This shift to a more familiar version of Lorde’s music even further draws listeners in to ponder the past compared to the present and how one will continue to change as the world does. The familiarity of the sound grounds the mysticalness of “Fallen Fruit” in something more recognizable, more human — almost as if it is a call to action.
Additional musical details throughout the album subtly link “Solar Power” to its predecessors “Melodrama” and “Pure Heroine.” In “Secrets from a Girl (Who’s Seen It All),” which Lorde described as being written for her younger self, vocal echoes pay homage to the sounds of “Pure Heroine.” 
Lyrical linkages between new and old Lorde are also embedded throughout the album. In “Big Star,” written in tribute to Lorde’s recently passed dog Pearl, Lorde sings, “Every perfect summer’s gotta say goodnight,” which alters a lyric from the “Melodrama” classic “Liability,” “Every perfect summer’s eating me alive until you’re gone.” 
The final track, “Oceanic Feeling,” directly confronts the separation of New Lorde from Old Lorde. “Now the cherry black-lipstick’s gathering dust in a drawer,” sings Lorde, alluding to herself in her “Pure Heroine” era. “I don’t need her anymore.”
The album marks a shift to a new version of Lorde. Regardless, she returns to the music scene with valuable things to ponder and a devotion to the betterment of our world and ourselves.
Lorde may emerge four years from now, or whenever the sun leads her path to the studio again. For now, float on the wave of “Solar Power” excitement, enjoying the new feelings Lorde has invited fans to bask in. From suburban streetlight to psychedelic limelight and, now, to glorious beachy sunlight, Lorde proves with “Solar Power” that she has come far and may yet have further to go.

Dining together once again. Students are not only reuniting with friends and faculty after 15 months of virtual learning, but will now be enjoying meals at USC’s dining halls, such as Parkside, Everybody’s Kitchen and the USC Village. 
During the 2020-21 academic year, USC Hospitality only operated out of EVK and provided carry-out meals for students. EVK accepted online orders through GrubHub which could connect to students’ USCards. 
USC Hospitality transitioned to providing in-person options this summer, opening EVK on weekdays for students rather than only quick service and carry-out options. 
Coming back onto campus, determining what and where to eat on campus can feel daunting for freshmen and sophomores alike. Dining experiences this year are still subject to change, but returning students expect to experience some resemblance of eating in the dining halls, pre-coronavirus. USC stated that in coronavirus reopening phases three and four “University housing and dining halls are open with capacity limits and enhanced safety provisions.” These provisions include mask wearing, social distancing and abiding by Los Angeles County Department of Public Health guidelines while in dining halls. 
Wondering what to expect next semester? Here are some tips and tricks to navigate your USC dining experience from juniors Olivia Dopp, Olivia Nicholson and Polly Le.
Everybody’s Kitchen
Closest to Birnkrant and New North Residential Colleges, Everybody’s Kitchen, fondly deemed EVK, prides itself on its “homestyle favorites” and is most known for traditional college dining. Even as the only dining hall with a breakfast smoothie bar, there is an ongoing debate among students on whether you should love or hate the food at EVK. 
“I’m an international student, so our orientation was right before Welcome Week. All the international students and their parents gathered together in EVK, [and] I loved the atmosphere. I met a lot of new friends; it was my first time trying out the college dining hall experience,” said Le, who is majoring in communications. 
One school spirited feature students are looking forward to, especially on football game days, is the custom USC waffle maker. 
“McCarthy and EVK have waffle makers you see everywhere, but they have the USC [logo] engraved in them so you get USC waffles, which I think is so fun,” said Dopp, who is majoring in theatre with an emphasis in acting. 
Additionally, EVK has one luxury most students cannot enjoy back at home: an all-day self-serve ice cream machine.
“I freaking love [that] there’s ice cream whenever you want; I’m definitely looking forward to that,” said Nicholson, who is majoring in theatre. 
 For the Fall 2021 semester, EVK will be open from 11 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Sundays and from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Mondays through Thursdays. 
Parkside Restaurant & Grill 
Parkside Restaurant & Grill is known for its variety of global cuisines and kosher, gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options. Located near the International Residential College, Parkside is farther from the USC Village and other residential colleges and buildings but students say that Parkside’s eclectic and nutritious food is worth the walk. Specifically, students are looking forward to the live egg bar during breakfast and the wide selection of pizza for lunch and dinner. 
With an extensive range of salads and sandwich options, Le explained that Parkside is her favorite dining hall because of its “really good wraps,” specifically, the tandoori chicken wraps. 
This semester, Parkside will be open from 11 a.m. until 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
USC Village 
USC Village dining hall, commonly referred to as McCarthy due to its proximity to the honors college, has a Hogwartsesque aura, drawing students from all parts of campus. USC Village also uniquely includes the first “flexitarian” and vegan stations for students. Although all of the dining halls have a variety of options for students with dietary restrictions, students recommend USC Village dining hall for vegan and vegetarian options. 
“My favorite food would definitely be their chicken teriyaki. My best friend and I, every day that it was there, went immediately to go get it,” Dopp said. 
Le hopes students try USC Village because it “has really good ramen.” As for Nicholson, she’s looking forward to one day of the week at USC Village. “I dream of Taco Tuesday,” Nicholson said. “I missed the tacos. The tacos in McCarthy are literally so amazing.” 
Students are also looking forward to the USC Village’s exclusive crepes, gelato and sorbet.
Right now, the USC Village dining hall is open at 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. Monday through Friday and at 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. 
Final Pro-Tips: 
Meet new people  
Whether it be over a bowl of cereal or a Greek salad, eating at any of the dining halls is an opportunity to connect. 
“[The dining hall] is such a fun place to meet people, because you’ll see your friends and they’re sitting with [strangers] and you’re like, ‘I guess I’ll sit here’ and it’s a fun way to make new friends,” Nicholson said. 
Especially for first-year students, the dining hall can encourage an equitable space for students to make new connections and bond on a level playing field.
 “As a freshman, everybody has to have a dining hall pass so you know if someone is feeling awkward or doesn’t have the money to go out and eat,” Dopp said. 
Check the menu 
The USC Hospitality website provides a sophisticated online platform for students to explore menus before entering the dining halls. 
Before students went remote last fall, Le explained how she would “go up to the USC Hospitality page and check out the menus to see which dining hall has the food that I like.” 
Dopp agrees that checking the USC Hospitality website can save time and stress at the dining halls. 
“In college, it’s just kind of just so hard and it can be so stressful sometimes,” Dopp said. ”If you’ve walked really far to a dining hall, and don’t have food that you like, it’s very upsetting. I think checking the menus before you walk far is a good strategy.”
Explore! 
There are countless combinations of dishes at the dining halls; the overall recommendation from students is to take advantage of the array of cuisines USC dining has to offer.

It has been almost a year and a half since USC turned to online learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now USC is welcoming students back to in-person classes. 
When the pandemic first began, professors had to quickly adapt to online teaching. With in-person classes happening in the fall, professors are preparing to transition back to on-campus classrooms. 
The Daily Trojan spoke to several professors to get insight into how they are feeling about returning to in-person classes. While some professors are looking forward to getting back in the classroom, others are nervous about the rising Delta variant cases in Los Angeles County. 
Jill Kickul, Scott Wiltermuth & Patricia Mills, Marshall School of Business 
A professor for 30 years, with the last five at USC, Jill Kickul has always enjoyed interacting with students. But when the coronavirus pandemic began in Spring 2020, she had to quickly transition from in-person classes to online classes within a few days. Now, with USC opening up its doors for in-person classes, Kickul can’t wait to get back to teaching in person.
“I’m really excited to get back into the classroom — really excited to interact with our students in an in-person environment,” said Kickul, a professor of clinical entrepreneurship and research at the Marshall School of Business. “The ability to see their full reaction and the in-person interactions that take place is just priceless compared to Zoom.” 
Kickul said professors and students did a “remarkable job” with their quick transition to online learning and were resilient. Although Kickul missed having in-person interactions with her students, she said she learned many valuable benefits from teaching online such as incorporating a mix of in person and online office hours as well as the opportunity to be diverse and inclusive by using technology to open up classrooms to the world.
“We have the technology to be able to bring a Zoom type environment into the classroom,” Kickul said. “You could bring in guest lecturers, guest speakers, live cases from anywhere in the world basically and they can drop into your class and speak to the students in that type of format.”
However, other professors are concerned about returning to in-person classes. With the rising cases of the Delta variant in L.A. County, professors like Scott Wiltermuth, associate professor of management and organization at Marshall, said he feels ambivalent about returning.
“[I have] mixed feelings [about returning to in-person classes],” Wiltermuth said. “It’ll be nice to see people, but, at the same time, the Delta variant seems strong, and a large segment of the population has not vaccinated themselves and that’s worrisome.”
According to L.A. Public Health, L.A. coronavirus cases are up to 3,000 a day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged everyone to get vaccinated as the Delta variant has higher rates of transmission and causes more severe illness in unvaccinated people than previous strains. 
Wiltermuth said he believes there are ways to mitigate risk and encourages people to get vaccinated to ensure the safety of the USC community in the fall. Both Kickul and Wiltermuth said USC has done an efficient job at providing training and resources such as classroom technology and counselors to get professors back in the classroom. 
The Center for Excellence in Teaching focuses on defining, developing, evaluating and rewarding teaching excellence at USC. CET provides support to faculty members in developing evidence-based teaching practices and evaluates teaching quality through peer-reviewed processes. 
“[CET] have really provided a plethora of resources for faculty to help them get back into the classroom,” Kickul said. “They were also excellent during the pandemic, providing us [with] resources on how to teach online and how to engage our students in an online environment.”
Within Marshall, Kickul said Patricia Mills, Vice Dean for Teaching and Innovation was supportive of professors in their transition back to in-person classes. 
“Last year that meant instructional designers worked closely with professors to develop compelling course content to be delivered online,” Mills said in an email to the Daily Trojan. Mills said this year USC is “taking what it learned during the pandemic, building on trends in education that were accelerated by COVID and welcoming students back to inclusive, innovative and inspiring in-person classes, regardless of any challenges that this semester may bring.”
Ronald McCurdy, Thornton School of Music 
At the Thornton School of Music, Professor Ronald McCurdy looks forward to returning to the classroom. McCurdy said he is excited to have his students perform together on stage instead of being separted from each other on Zoom. 
“We are accustomed to doing a communal event. When you do music you do it together you don’t do it in isolation,” said McCurdy, assistant dean and director of the Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee. “Granted, you compose in isolation, you practice in isolation, but all of that is a means to an end, which means you come together as a unit to create art and music.”
However, McCurdy said he is apprehensive about the fallout of the Delta variant. Fully vaccinated, McCurdy plans to be careful being back on campus and looks to implement precautionary measures, such as a classroom policy that has students asking all their questions from their seats, instead of coming up to his desk after class, to keep social distance. 
McCurdy said he is pleased with USC’s transparency and appreciates being kept informed and updated about the latest coronavirus related decisions. 
“I think USC has been very good about letting us know where things are and giving us a system to be nimble because we don’t want to deal with a bunch of unknowns,” McCurdy said. “We don’t know how that’s gonna play out. Are we going to get back to a true sense of normalcy, or will there be yet another variant emerging? We don’t know. I do appreciate USC being very transparent in letting us know where we are. The protocol is to open the campus back up and keep everybody safe.”
Although adjusting to an online environment was challenging, there have been many positive aspects of the pandemic, McCurdy said, including bringing in American folk-jazz vocalist Bobby McFerrin as a guest speaker during his online classes which wouldn’t have happened in-person. 
“I’m very proud of our students and my colleagues, because it’s been a very difficult year and a half, teaching online but out of it there were some silver linings in terms of learning new ways to dispense information,” McCurdy said. “My new role as Assistant Dean of JEDI means the whole idea of looking at what we teach, how we teach, diversifying our curriculum to decolonize our curriculum to really be more inclusive, about what we teach and how we teach it. I think that that’s going to change, so I’m looking forward to it. I’m very excited about getting started.”
Marc Ballon, Viterbi School of Engineering
Marc Ballon, part-time lecturer of engineering writing at Viterbi School of Engineering, is eager to teach in person again. Ballon thinks that he and his students will get more out of in-person classes because they are more interactive. 
“[With in person classes] they could see my gestures, I could see their gestures. We could have side conversations,” Ballon said. “On Zoom, it was like looking at the old TV show ‘The Hollywood Squares,’ where I just had a bunch of faces, impassively looking at me. Let me tell you, trying to keep 19 people who are on Zoom, and all over the world, in different time zones engaged, was really, really, really challenging.”
To transition back to in-person classes, USC has been holding courses on how to teach hybrid lessons. If a student, such as an international student, was not able to get a visa, professors have been taught how to incorporate them into the classroom through the use of technology. 
In terms of his own personal safety, Ballon is not too concerned because he is fully vaccinated and will be wearing a mask to class. However, he is worried about the possibility of faculty and staff not being honest about their vaccination status, potentially infecting other people and resulting in an outbreak. 
“Even if everybody is being honest [about their vaccination status], there could be a COVID outbreak,” Ballon said. “I’m not worried about getting sick and in the hospital, but I am worried about classes shutting down. My fear is that we’ll be in class for a few weeks and then we’ll be some sort of COVID outbreak and things will shut down again. That’s my biggest fear. I wanted to be in class all semester.”
However, despite being nervous about the prospect of shutting down classes due to potential outbreaks, Ballon said he is “really happy with the way the administration is requiring people to either get vaccinated or get tested. I think that’s so important, and I applaud USC for being on top of this. It is so important to keep campus open to keep people safe. So, they get an A for its COVID policies and test policies.”
John Walsh, Leonard Davis School of Gerontology
John Walsh is an associate professor of gerontology at Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and is excited about returning to in-person classes. However, the Delta variant concerns him because it is more infectious and aggressive than other coronavirus variants. Walsh’s wife has leukemia, and if she gets infected with coronavirus she could be in trouble.
“My concern [is] the death rate for people with her kind of leukemia was about 40%, whereas the death rate for the general population was about 2%,” Walsh said. 
The School of Gerontology has its own building and, as a result, has complete control over how to organize it. Classrooms will be wiped down each class and plexiglass barriers have been set up for teachers. HEPA filters, and air purifiers, have been ordered to protect both students and faculty in smaller classrooms. 
According to L.A. County rules, faculty and students will wear masks in the classroom. To make sure students can hear the professor, instructors at Leonard Davis have been given headsets that will wirelessly go into the sound system that exists in every classroom. 
At the school of gerontology, video capture rooms will support students who are not able to make it to in-person classes. The footage will be posted to a program called Mediasite. Students will have the option of being in-person but if they’re not comfortable, can choose to stay home. 
“[The coronavirus] is going to be with us for a while. Some people are predicting that instead of being a pandemic it’s going to be what’s called an endemic to society, meaning it’s never going to go away. So you have to adapt,” Walsh said. “Students, they need to just be responsible and look after themselves.”
Paul Urcioli, School of Dramatic Arts
Paul Urcioli is an adjunct lecturer at the School of Dramatic Arts. Urcioli teaches acting and had to adapt his courses when he transitioned to online classes. 
“I teach acting classes so I’ve been teaching acting over Zoom for 18 months, and as much as I was proud of all the things my students accomplished and things we were able to do over Zoom, it’s acting and there’s no substitute for being in the same physical space with the people you’re creating work with and working off with other human beings who are in the same room as you so it’s like I’ve been dying to get back into the classroom ever since they shut us down.”
Urcioli said that the first semester of teaching acting online was uncharted territory. However, by the Fall of 2020 Urcioli felt prepared for online teaching. The students he had in his classes were on camera acting so Urcioli completely redid some of the exercises and tried to suit it more towards working with Zoom and did self-tapes. 
“I don’t want to say I lowered the bar, but we did sort of have more realistic expectations of the kind of work we would be able to do,” Uricoli said. “Looking in our tiny computer screens and not having the whole physical space to work with each other but I have to say the ensemble I had in the fall of 2020 in my scene study class was tremendous. They did some of the best work I’ve had students do in all my time at USC.”
With USC starting in-person classes, Urcioli said he is not too concerned about the variants because of USC’s vaccine policy and the support he has gotten from the School of Dramatic Arts. However, Urcioli said that people will need to slowly readjust to the learning environment. 
“People have not been in the classroom together for a year and a half, and I think there’s gonna be a kind of let’s start slowly and tiptoe first and then walk and then you know, little by little, because I think it’s gonna be strange for us to be back in person.”
Lisa Krohn, Iovine and Young Academy
Lisa Krohn is an assistant professor of practice and design at Iovine and Young Academy. Krohn is looking forward to in-person relationships with students and colleagues. However, she said she is apprehensive about the Delta variant, even after being vaccinated. 
“I think the students were feeling a little bit more urgent to be in the classroom, maybe than I was but I respect that,” Krohn said. “I’m feeling that this will be a wonderful adventure because I started teaching in the fall of 2020 at USC. So, I have been online during my whole career so far.” 
Krohn starts teaching in the morning and finishes at 8:30 p.m. The idea of wearing a mask that long is overwhelming to her and is not something she has done yet. However, Krohn acknowledges that wearing a mask is the most effective way of controlling the spread of the coronavirus. 
“I’m a healthy person, and I feel like it’s my duty to be in the classroom,” Krohn said. “To the extent county health authorities are dictating, we’re all okay to be back in person. So, yes, you know there is a risk. I’m aware of it, it’s a calculated risk. And I consider it a risk I’m willing to take in the line of duty.”
The support Krohn is looking for is hand sanitizing stations in frequent locations. Krohn would also like to see efforts by the University to make things touchless such as door handles that require people to hold it. 
“I would hope that the university would do a kind of audit, where they look through and see what ways they can avoid the necessity of us touching surfaces frequently,” Krohn said. “There’s certain times that you’re forced to grab a faucet or a door handle, and those are the areas that I think create kind of low-level tension for all of us.”

A student who works 27 hours a week with two jobs to support herself, Zoe Laub found remote learning less demanding on her mental health because she was able to simply log on to her classes anywhere without having to worry about hurrying home from classes to change for work and catching a bus – which also allowed her to have a more flexible work schedule and get more sleep.
But following USC’s announcement of in-person classes for the fall semester, Laub, a senior majoring in English creative writing, found herself part of conversations online regarding concerns about limited remote options.
After seeing concerns from students about how returning to campus may affect the health of family members or themselves, international students facing difficulties accessing their courses, and many students concerned about how the arrival of thousands of students to Los Angeles might affect the campus’s surrounding community, Laub created a petition Aug. 13 urging USC to offer online or hybrid options for students and faculty for the fall semester.  
“For me, [online learning has] actually been a lot more convenient and easier on my mental health just because I have to work to support myself, and so the commute and just having to deal with the time that takes, it was kind of stressful,” Laub said. “But this petition is more … for students who are at risk, faculty who are at risk and their family members and international students who are facing difficulty getting access to their courses, more than people who just prefer online format.”
With 1,600 signatures at the time of publication, the petition cites concerns about returning to full capacity, in-person classes due to increasing cases among L.A. in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals as a result of the Delta variant. 
“I feel like the University isn’t really prepared,” Laub said. “I think they could have been but they’re trying to quickly return to a sense of normalcy, when the reality is we’re still in a global pandemic.”
The petition, addressed to President Carol Folt, urges the University to give students, who do not feel safe returning to campus, the option to attend the semester remotely. The petition does not demand a fully online model, Laub said. 
In a student media briefing Thursday, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said 42 positive coronavirus cases appeared from the 10,000 tests performed between Aug. 15 and 18. — a lower positivity rate than the week before. Cases are expected to peak about two weeks after students move in and then start dropping by week three and four, she said.
Alyssa Delarosa, a senior majoring in psychology, worries that measures such as Trojan Checks and weekly coronavirus tests will not be enough to stop the virus from rapidly spreading on campus, as USC hosted thousands of Trojans attending welcome events and plans for most classes to return to “business as usual.” 
Even as Delarosa looks forward to experiencing her senior year in person after more than a year of online learning and as events had been scheduled to resume, she said she doesn’t feel safe seeking out the in-person college experience and will spend most of her time in isolation.
“I really want to return to campus more than anything, … but the Delta variant has other plans,” Delarosa said. “The ICUs are filling up again. So many kids are getting [the coronavirus] now too, and with all that going on, I want to put my safety first before having the experience of being on campus. My safety is a top priority, and it’s just not safe to return right now.”
Maria Robles, a freshman majoring in communication, is also concerned that required coronavirus testing will become more lenient throughout the course of the semester.
“To get everybody tested once or twice a week, especially with 40,000 plus students, that’s going to be a hassle and eventually, over the weeks, it’s going to get more and more lenient,” Robles said. 
In the student media briefing, Van Orman said that if cases “go way down” over the course of the semester, the University could drop the testing requirement. 
Emails obtained by the Daily Trojan from professors — including representatives from faculty council and senate groups — to USC administrators expressed concerns about returning to campus. However, various administrators allegedly told faculty that students don’t share their concerns.
Anonymous posts on the Instagram page @sconcernedstaff, which posts anonymous confessions from faculty members, shared the experiences of employees taking public transportation to USC despite public health concerns, dealing with the stress of returning to work with an immunocompromised infant at home and concerns about poor work conditions, including a lack of windows and poor ventilation.
“We are losing well-trained staff,” wrote @sconcernedstaff in an Instagram post on Aug. 19.  “In more than 15 years at USC, I have always been proud to be a part of the Trojan family. We have overcome several tough transitions and defended the University’s reputation because we believed in it. But watching my colleagues struggle with this decision hurts … We are being asked to risk our personal and family’s lives in some cases unnecessarily.” 
Robles said she also wants online class options because she believes it is important to protect the surrounding USC community and those who are immunocompromised.
“There’s so many people who have [immunocompromised] systems, and it’s just very concerning,” Robles said. “​​It’s just best to have an online option for the sake of safety and protecting others, because it really does have devastating effects.”

This June, I sensed something different in the air. 
Long gone were the nervous energies of daily life and what would come next. Daily new coronavirus cases dropped to triple digits in Los Angeles for the first time since March 2020. It seemed like everything was back to normal on June 15 when the state “reopened.”
Masks went inside tucked away and a post-pandemic life awaited outside the door. 
Life without masks lasted a couple of weeks with no masks. Now, they’re back — for both vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens.
You may be wondering, “this is the sports section, I don’t want to read about the coronavirus.” Unfortunately, there is no escape from it. 
It doesn’t care if you’re a five-star football recruit from Los Angeles or a volleyball star from Orange, so why should I act like it doesn’t exist? 
I can guarantee that for most of this semester’s column, which is still about all things Los Angeles sports, the coronavirus will be part of it. It’s why this sports season will be yet another one stuffed with coronavirus cases and unpredictability. We can act like things are all going back to normal, but in reality, we’re far from it. 
Vaccines still need to be distributed and masks put on before we can tailgate the virus away. However, things are not as bleak as what I’ve written.
The world, and LA itself, is in a much better place than it was a year ago. Almost all pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted for the time being and life is slowly, but surely getting back to normal.
It’s a promising time for USC Athletics. Fans and students will finally be able to support athletes in person. The lost season will hopefully be fulfilled by increased engagement and show some signs of normalcy.
I’m not in a position to give recommendations, but this is my column so I will do it. I’d recommend not only supporting the main sports like football or basketball but going to the lesser supported ones on campus. It’s imperative to do so, especially because of the lost year of attendance. 
The pandemonium that ensues with Trojan football is, well, still here. Many questions still need answering like the offensive line depth, wide receivers and, of course, if junior quarterback Kedon Slovis can go back to his freshman self.
Women’s volleyball is back from a 7-8 season and hoping to build on something for the future. They finished the season on a four-game winning streak, notching wins against UCLA, Arizona and Colorado. It’s a promising time for them to establish themselves as legitimate contenders this season.
Both football and women’s volleyball will be the early test on whether the conditions and restrictions put in place will work this semester. 
Vaccination rates are high across football with head coach Clay Helton mentioning over 90% of the team is vaccinated. Women’s volleyball is yet to announce its statistics. 
There are things to be happy about. Another season brings new expectations and excitement about possible results. 
As fans fill the stands, let’s hope it’s permanent, not temporary.

The United States has a new favorite pastime. It is neither football nor the movies but sitting on the couch and aimlessly scrolling through social media. With the school year quickly approaching, many students share the same common fear: socialization. But with coronavirus restrictions back on the rise, many students are questioning whether they would risk their health to go to that party everyone’s talking about.
While sitting behind a screen might sound nice for a period of time, getting out and talking to people is part of human nature. The post-pandemic lifestyle may seem daunting to jump right back into, but taking baby steps will aid the process. 
According to PsychCentral, now more than ever, students are spending “an average of 10 hours a day on their cell phones.” This significant finding not only puts strain on your eyes but can also increase the likeliness of migraines and loss of focus. You may be able to go to the store and buy a pair of trendy blue light glasses, but the long-term impacts are still uncertain. 
Psychologist Larry Rosen suggests that taking “technology breaks” will ultimately increase a student’s attention span. Because of the proven benefits of swapping blue light for natural sunlight, students should be encouraged to change their study spots. By doing so, this opens up another opportunity for communication to occur and can expand one’s study circle. 
Even if someone is naturally shy or anxious in social situations, it’s important to understand that taking small steps to introduce yourself to others can open up new friendships. Once this foundation is set, setting up get-togethers will eliminate the urge to constantly be on your device. This can ultimately reduce pressure when interacting with others, making it easier to branch out and form further connections. 
Sometimes a simple confidence boost, such as going out for coffee or shopping for clothes, can elevate one’s mood. While it may sound like a cliché, learning to enjoy the simpler things in life can really transform one’s overall mood. 
Adjusting to in-person classes can be especially challenging for transfer or out-of-state students. This is a perfect opportunity to branch out and meet new people through clubs and organizations. Expressing oneself can lead to forming natural connections. 
Now is the perfect opportunity to allow for change to happen. With a fresh new year ahead of us, we can make room for positive changes. Taking the time to truly find ourselves through our major, interests and unknown hobbies will allow us to take time away from the screen. 
For all of these changes to happen, students must regularly make small adjustments. Allowing ourselves the space to step outside our comfort zone is a crucial act in reducing existing anxiety. Understanding that variants are inevitable with the coronavirus definitely leads to additional stress in students’ lives, but for now, we can focus on making smart decisions such as following countywide mask mandates, maintaining social distance and washing hands. 
Students must also consider options to help and support themselves upon returning to campus. Fortunately, the USC Student Health Office offers several group sessions specifically targeting students’ needs. Whether it be through practicing mindfulness or therapy, coming together as a community and sharing vulnerable moments is a powerful way students can overcome their uneasiness. 
Talking is the best remedy, and with only aimless emojis, the matter will never be solved. So before the next time you feel tempted to reach for your comfort blanket of a phone, go out and meet real students — while masked — who can help relieve that anxiety.

Croix Bethune started dreaming of becoming a professional soccer player at the age of 3. Having played several sports throughout her childhood, it was her love for soccer that inspired her to push through the struggles and claim her spot as one of the top players in the country. 
Bethune first started playing soccer when she lived in Georgia, but it was her family’s move to England that made her take the sport seriously. 
“It’s always just been fun to me,” Bethune said. “I’ve been told I’m really good at what I do.” 
After playing in England for almost four years, Bethune started going to international camps to countries such as Argentina at the age of 13. It was there that her appreciation for different soccer cultures grew, and she became excited to immerse herself in such a community. 
Her skill and talent caught the attention of women’s soccer head coach Keidane McAlpine long before she became a part of the Trojans. 
“[Bethune had] a level of skill and competitiveness that I thought was exceptional and made her stand out immediately,” McAlpine said. “The way she controlled her team, took over games and played with confidence, I thought [she] was worthy of being watched for a long time.” 
McAlpine was not the only one who noticed Bethune’s exceptional understanding of the game. Throughout her high school career, she was recognized for her talent. She was named top midfielder in the country in 2017 and also earned Best XI recognition in both 2017 and 2018. 
The first time redshirt senior and fellow midfielder Savannah DeMelo saw Bethune play in England, she was amazed. 
“She had a lot of confidence in herself and her abilities to take people on,” DeMelo said. “She [knew] how to play the game very well, was super crafty and overall I felt she was a diverse and well-rounded player.” 
After graduating in 2019, Bethune was ready to become a key player in the midfield for the Trojans. However, two ACL tears forced her onto the bench for the entirety of her freshman season. For a player who had never injured herself, Bethune said that the first tear impacted her mindset but it never stopped her from pushing herself back into form. 
“You can’t go out there scared or something negative is going to happen,” Bethune said. “You just handle the business and hard work behind the scenes so during game time you know you’re ready.” 
Alongside Bethune, DeMelo was also sidelined for the 2019 season with an achilles injury.
“We learned a lot about the mental side of the game,” DeMelo said. “I think it just made us hungrier to come back [the next] season and give it everything we had.”
McAlpine echoed a similar sentiment.
“All players that get injured, who truly love to play, come back with a sense of urgency and appreciation for being able to play,” McAlpine said. “It was frustrating for her to watch and know that she could impact games and her team’s success…You learn by watching sometimes, and when the game is taken away, you’re forced to watch, so I think she grew a lot in those areas.” 
Bethune’s dedication to the game pushed her to recover from her setback, and she gained clearance to play in the 2020 season. However, she encountered another setback when spring sports were put on hold due to the pandemic. Bethune and DeMelo both called this time a blessing in disguise, as it allowed them to take additional time after their injuries to not only get fitter, but also gain their confidence back. 
It was two years late, but Bethune finally played her first game as a Trojan against BYU Feb. 15, where she assisted two goals in a 4-3 overtime win. 
“I was so anxious and excited to play [my first match],” Bethune said. “The game is quicker [than high school], but being into national camps, you kind of see how it doesn’t really change because you’re already in that environment. They try to keep you in that same environment so things aren’t as different when you move off to college.” 
Alongside soccer, Bethune was also a successful basketball player in high school. McAlpine said Bethune was able to commit more time to soccer and become a stronger and more durable player on the field when she took a step back from basketball. McAlpine believes that the next progression for her is to understand how to adapt her role in the game and find a balance within the team. 
“With her knee brace coming off, Croix is going to get her rhythm back which will push her forward in the next seasons,” McAlpine said. “She is going to be impactful for us and is going to be a leader in the team.”
Bethune, who had never played without fans in the stands, said it was a different experience. However, she thought the absence of fame helped the team build a stronger connection and allowed her to focus on her play. 
“The thing I love about her is that she knows the game,” DeMelo said. “Her movement is something that you can’t really teach somebody. It’s very easy to know what she’s gonna do. It’s more of an understanding of each other that was never verbally there, we just know because of how we watch and study the game.” 
While her skill level and composure have impressed this past season, it was her transition from being injured to being able to play that was the highlight of her performance. 
“Not being able to do some of the things she wants to do because she’s wearing the brace but still finding a way to be impactful, learning the game in terms of the tempo and physicality of the collegiate team and learning the urgency of every game was a growth spurt not only for her but our team in general,” McAlpine said. 
As serious and focused as Bethune is when she’s wearing her cleats on the field, she is just as lighthearted and easy-going off it. 
“She loves to dance before games, but also needs her time to listen to her music and get into her groove,” DeMelo said. “She’s a huge team player and is always gonna do what’s best for the team.”
Bethune’s hat-trick against California was a sneak peek into the heights that the young player can reach. 
“It felt great, those were my first goals of the season,” Bethune said. “It made me feel like I’m getting back into the groove of my old self.”

In the midst of cancel culture, many people forget how to genuinely take responsibility for their actions and similarly forget to hold others accountable due to the fear of being labeled a “hater.” Today, lack of accountability starts with the most publicized crowd: celebrities. Recently, 19-year-old singer Billie Eilish has faced scrutiny and loss of support, especially from LGBTQ+ fans, due to her actions while promoting her new video “Lost Cause.”
On June 10, Eilish posted a series of photos from her video that consisted of only women labeled, “i love girls.” It is important to note that, even if not intentional, the timing of her post fell during Pride Month, so many fans considered this a coming out post. No, fans don’t have a right to know everything about Eilish; however, her actions after the post — not clarifying or apologizing for queerbaiting and calling fans “embarrassing” — warranted justifiable disapproval. The problem occurred when many LGBTQ+ fans spoke out about how Eilish’s actions were not only queerbaiting but also further stigmatized women-loving women. 
Queerbaiting is when a public figure capitalizes off of queer identities and seemingly queer story lines to gain interest from queer audiences — who are largely underrepresented — without the intention of actualizing or confirming suspicions. This happens not only in movies and television but also with artists who objectify queerness as a marketing technique. 
Along with queerbaiting, the “Lost Cause” incident highlights how WLW representation is often used to sell to the male gaze, further fetishizing this group. There is obviously a difference between being comfortable with your body, as Eilish has been trying to do, and fetishizing WLW; however, it’s hard to know where to draw the line in this situation due to Eilish’s history of queerbaiting that goes beyond what happened this past June. In 2019, Eilish received backlash for her song “wish you were gay.” Instead of it being a song about a LGBTQ+ romance as some expected, it is about a girl wishing that a guy was gay to validate him not liking her.  
Despite Eilish’s history of queerbaiting and other questionable actions, including her using African American Vernacular English and ridiculing Asian accents, her white, straight female fanbase stands by Eilish, unfazed by how truly harmful these actions are. 
This fact is the root of the problem goes beyond one person or situation. LGBTQ+, Black and Asian fans of Eilish have spoken out about her harmful actions, not asking for her to be canceled but to be held accountable; yet Eilish’s own privilege, along with the privilege of her white fanbase shields her from having to truly step back and evaluate how her actions can be perceived as harmful, which stops her from growing as a person. Accountability is impossible when privilege remains unrecognized and shields questionable actions. 
In fact, fans of Eilish often similarly queerbait and defend Eilish’s actions rather than evaluating and taking time to educate themselves on the history behind queerbaiting, AAVE and Asian slurs. White women in the entertainment industry and in everyday life alike are shielded by unchecked privilege and ultimately evade true accountability. Eilish’s Vogue cover is an example where she, a white woman, was seen as a revolutionary icon of body positivity while the reception of Chloe and Halle Bailey’s similar photos on Cosmopolitan were hypersexualized and critiqued. 
This difference in standards not only speaks to how intersectionality plays a role in the industry but also to how white privilege warrants more praise and positive attention while women of color are shamed. Calling out these incidents and questionable actions is seen as “canceling” instead of what it’s meant to be: a chance to learn and grow which is yet another layer of unchecked privilege. 
The white feminism paradigm among Eilish and her white women fanbase is only one of many examples of how privilege intervenes with accountability and true progress if left unrecognized. Ultimately, without awareness, society will be left stagnant in this culture of canceling rather than true accountability and learning.
