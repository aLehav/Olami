Coming to you this week just in time for the rainy weekend (and the reminder that elsewhere in the world, they have seasons): a soup puree that I hope will make your tastebuds dance and your heart rejoice.
Seriously, I make a vat of this and then refrigerate/freeze so I can eat it for a week straight. It’s like gourmet baby food (I promise, good, not gross!) I use up all the tupperware in our household to do so, and bribe my roommates with tastes of it, so that they don’t yell at me. <3
This is actually “my own recipe,” which means nothing, because unfortunately I am not the only person to have thought of mixing the wonderful sweet potato with curry flavors. But I’d like to claim it anyways, if there are no objections? Ok cool. Also, on the sweet potato vs. yam debate, I think I fall yam (the bright orange ones!) but call it a sweet potato.
The basic idea for this dish comes from the concept of the “phodni,” which is the basis for much of Indian cooking: frying spices in heated oil to bring out their fragrance, before adding any other ingredients. It’s how you start most savory Indian dishes, and also the only real Indian cooking I know how to do, so that works out in my favor.
To the phodni, you’ll be adding veggies and more spices, cooking til soft and then pureeing! It is as simple as that. YES.
Served amazingly on it’s own, or with a yolky fried egg atop some quinoa (my personal fave), or as a sauce for pasta (haven’t tried this but YUM), or however your little sweet potato heart desires. It has an amazing creamy consistency purely because of the smooth texture of the sweet potato, with a heated kick at the end, so it can be pretty versatile.
It’s also vegan, gluten free, and 90 percent fat free. And the best part is, I wasn’t trying to accomplish that, so it tastes like normal (amazing) food! Make enough for two, and serve up to your boo this cuddle-weather weekend. I’ll be snuggled up with my favorite man too: Frank Underwood, ie Kevin Spacey, because House of Cards comes out this weekend. But I digress.
