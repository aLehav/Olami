Students might recognize him as USC’s leading returning tackler or the ultimate terror for opposing offenses’ run game, but those who really know him also know of his guilty pleasure for sour gummy worms and Sour Patch Kids.
When No. 56 takes off his helmet, often revealing a long ponytail or braids, Trojan fans see him as none other than redshirt senior captain Anthony Sarao.
It is immediately obvious that Sarao, the only New Jersey representative on the roster, is not from California. How so? He has a bit of an accent that he describes as “East Coast Jersey slang,” though Sarao has always had a Californian state of mind.
Even early in the recruiting process, he was already set on going out west to play for his former high school coach who, at the time, worked for the Cardinal.
Once Jim Harbaugh, now the head coach at Michigan, and his coach left Stanford, Sarao decided to explore other options.
He knew USC was the right fit after his official visit and Sarao eventually switched his commitment from Stanford to USC close to signing day.
“I was focused on getting a good degree. On the East Coast you can’t get the best of both worlds. ’SC had both [academics and athletics].”
He may love California, but Sarao made it clear in last year’s game against UCLA that he takes no prisoners when it comes to in-state rivals.
Even though USC didn’t win the game, Sarao ran back a pick six, having one of the three defensive touchdowns of last season.
His expectations for this season aren’t any different. The USC coaching staff expects a lot out of Sarao and he thinks that linebacker coach Peter Sirmon has taken his game to a new level.
“[Sirmon] is one of the best coaches in the nation,” he said. He’s been in our place once and played in the league for a while, so he has helped us a lot.”
Sarao has been a dominant inside linebacker for the past three years.
Though this year might be a little different after losing former Captain Hayes Pullard to the NFL draft and graduation, the USC linebacker corps has great depth and promise.
“We lost a real leader in Hayes, but Anthony [Sarao] is a veteran who can lead this unit,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said at media day.
In regard to USC’s linebacker unit this year, Sarao said that each player brings something different to the table with his respective talents.
“We all fill different roles now and are more developed,” Sarao said. “Everyone is so versatile and has their own style while still playing as Trojans.”
As a senior and captain, Sarao has been navigating his way through the powerhouse football program and prestigious academic institution since 2011.
It’s been a long journey for Sarao, who received his bachelor’s degree in policy, planning and development in the spring of 2015 and is working towards a master’s degree in sociology this fall.
Sarao said his most memorable moment thus far as a Trojan has to be walking out of the tunnel in the Coliseum to play in his first game.
But Sarao said he’s more than just a student-athlete.
“I’m a family man, and my ultimate goal is for my family to be financially stable,” he said.
Sarao hopes to make his last year in a USC uniform his most successful one yet.

In the second edition of our exclusive series, “Back to School,” the DT caught up with former USC quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart.
USC has always been renowned for its greek system, but its most exclusive club might very well be that of former Trojan quarterbacks. From Rodney Peete in the ’80s to Carson Palmer at the start of the new millennium, USC quarterbacks have had a tremendous amount of on-field success, earning the program the designation of “Quarterback U.”
Arguably the greatest legacy a USC quarterback can leave at the school, though, is a national championship, and the last one to accomplish that was none other than 2004 Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart, who led the Trojans to a 55-19 victory in the 2005 Orange Bowl over Oklahoma. After falling short to Vince Young and the Texas Longhorns in a memorable 2006 Rose Bowl, Leinart went on to play in the NFL for the Arizona Cardinals, Houston Texans and Oakland Raiders before leaving the professional game in 2013.
With his No. 11 jersey retired under the peristyle of the Coliseum after he graduated, Leinart has never really left USC. Now, he is back in full-force in the college football world as a studio analyst on FOX Sports 1’s “College Football” show. He also frequently makes appearances on the Pac-12 Network.
Since transitioning from the field to the studio and making his debut as an analyst in 2014, Leinart has had the opportunity to experience the other side of the college game.
“Being surrounded by the media, it’s different, but it’s fun,” Leinart said. “But I’ve always loved college football and the tradition and history of it all.”
A two-time All-American, Leinart wrote a lot of his own history with the Pete Caroll-coached teams he quarterbacked, but he’s looking forward to seeing what this year’s team can accomplish under second-year head coach Steve Sarkisian.
“Last year was difficult learning a new system and having some of those growing pains, but it’s a new year, the team’s learning from their mistakes in game situations and all they have to do is keep moving forward,” Leinart said.
Leinart seemed satisfied with the team’s first victory of the season over Arkansas State, 55-6, last Saturday.
“Week one, you always have to look at the big picture, especially with a team that you are expected to beat, but I thought they had a pretty solid performance,” Leinart said. “A lot of guys played, Cody [Kessler] looked good, Ronald Jones showed some things, so it was good all around.”
He does believe, though, that the Trojans have areas to work and build upon, especially up front.
“The struggles of the offensive line to protect Cody [Kessler] were definitely a concern,” Leinart said. “I wouldn’t be too alarmed because they will go back and look at the film and learn from their mistakes, whether it was a missed assignment or communication issues, but when you’re going to be playing a team like Stanford in a couple of weeks, it’s important to improve.”
While comparisons have been made between the playing styles of Leinart and redshirt senior Cody Kessler, who is looking to follow in his predecessor’s footsteps after having a record-breaking season in 2014 on his way to becoming an early season Heisman Trophy candidate, Leinart believes that at the end of the day, Kessler has done a great job at becoming his own type of player and leader.
“He’s got such a good head on his shoulders and knows to control what he can control and lead his football team,” Leinart said. “He’s not a flashy guy, but he’s a winner and is a lot more athletic than people give him credit for.”
Another current USC player who reminds Leinart of one of his former teammates, the electric Reggie Bush, is sophomore cornerback and wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson.
“Adoree’s a special player,” Leinart said. “He’s one of those players that, like Reggie, whenever he touches the ball, everyone just holds their breath to see what they’re going to do.”
Some USC players might be giving Leinart a blast from the past, but he says that offenses in college football have drastically changed since he first lined up under center.
“It’s completely different now,” Leinart said. “It used to be a lot more pro-style from under center, but now more than 50 percent of offenses just line up going no-huddle, and we see a lot of spread offenses.”
Now in the second year of Sarkisian’s up-tempo system, the Trojans playing style has surely changed, but as they get ready to play just their second game of the season against Idaho on Saturday, Leinart says that the team’s mentality should remain the same.
“Never read the papers, don’t believe in your own hype and always be focused on the team,” Leinart said. “The rest will take care of itself.”

Many fans keenly look forward to USC gameday each week, but their experience is one far removed from that of the players leading up to kickoff.
For redshirt junior offensive lineman Zach Banner, the contrast could not be any more pronounced.
Unlike many students on game days — who often aim to overlap with as many friends as possible before kickoff — Banner completely shuts himself off from the outside world, switching his phone onto “airplane mode” and using the device solely for music.
Before he does that, though, Banner places two calls: one to home to talk with his parents and another to his uncle, who resides in Texas.
“Calling my parents and my Uncle Mark in the morning when I wake up helps get me in the mindset that I am playing for my family, not just myself,” Banner said. “After that, I put my phone on airplane mode and cut the rest of the world off. It’s all about football from that point forward.”
For someone who proudly likens himself to the Incredible Hulk — not only because he shares a last name with the fictional Marvel Comics scientist-turned-big-green-fighting-machine Bruce Banner, but also because of his towering 6-foot-9, 357-pound build and forceful, overpowering plays in the football trenches — Zach’s weekly withdrawal serves very much as a comic-like foreshadowing. The extreme focus and relative silence before games preface the moment in which Banner will storm out of the Coliseum tunnel and, much like Bruce Banner, begin to activate his “beast contained within.”
The intensity and grit with which Banner approaches the game of football derives from an inner drive to be the best offensive lineman in the country and an understanding that his success in reaching that goal will come not from the size of the dog in the fight, but from the amount of fight in the dog.
“It’s all about what’s on the inside,” Banner said of why he has been successful as a football player. “It’s about the will to be the best, the will to be great. Ignore the size — that’s automatic, a given. It’s about having the need and the desire to have a great career — not just a good career —  and the understanding that I have to work hard for it. It’s not going to just come easy.”
While Banner’s pregame preparation necessitates the removal of non-football related interactions in order to fully focus his mind and body, he is also well-known for his Hulk-sized kindness and infectiously magnetic personality on days not beginning with the word “game.”
Often seen sharing a laugh or conversing with students, coaches and faculty, it is little surprise that down the road — whenever it comes time to hang up the pads for the final time — Zach hopes to use his charismatic gifts to pursue a career on-screen.
“After football, I really want to go into broadcast journalism,” Banner said. “I have a passion to stay around sports and to create a good character for myself on camera. I idolize the things that Shaquille O’Neal is doing in basketball and would love to do that for the sport of football.”
Widely considered to be a strong NFL prospect, it may be a while until Banner uses his on-screen talents to pursue an off-field career. However, his willingness to use his voice is one that is already paying dividends for him in a big way.
“Being so vocal makes it easy to build relationships,” Banner said. “I think that’s why people trust me and want to work with me. They know that I’m both a fun guy but also that I’m going to work hard.”
On the practice field, Banner can be audibly heard along the offensive line communicating play calls, helping raise the level of intensity and mentoring some of the less-experienced underclassmen.
His verbal leadership has been especially welcome over the last few months during a coaching transition in which former Oklahoma State and 20-year coaching veteran Bob Connelly was brought in to replace former USC offensive line coach and current Michigan offensive coordinator Tim Drevno.
In a situation that could have set the Trojan offensive line back a few steps heading into a season widely hoped to be “the return of dominant USC football,” Connelly has instead helped revitalize the O-Line unit, pushing it in a positive direction.
Much of that, Banner said, is due to the way in which Connelly interacts with players, which channels the way in which he himself tries to interact with others.
“He’s the best offensive line coach I’ve ever had, and I mean that,” Banner said. “He not only knows his stuff in terms of the X’s and O’s, but he also knows how to build relationships, just like I try to do. He knows how to care about you on and off the field.”
It certainly helps that the group of guys Connelly inherited — Banner included — feature a mix of both young and experienced talent who possess a determination to improve.
“We’ve got a great leader and four-year player in Max Tuerk, and two guys who came in at the same time as him, but redshirted like myself and Chad Wheeler,” Banner said. “Max is the best center in the country, and Chad and I have a hunger to be just as good as he is and be the best in the country at our respective positions — left and right tackle.”
Banner’s confidence in the offensive line is reflective of a broader sentiment permeating through the USC football team this year. Despite the hype, media spotlight and inflated expectations that come with being a premier sports program at a top collegiate institution — and one that happens to reside in the second largest city and TV market in the country — Banner feels that the team is successfully blocking out potential distractions and instead focusing on themselves.
He attributes this to strong parity between players and coaches in moving toward their goal to win the Pac-12 championship for the first time since 2008 and subsequently earn a berth in the College Football Playoff. At the core of this quest, Banner said, is a team-wide understanding and mindset that they are playing for something bigger than individual success,
“Hopefully, we will have a ring to show for what we have done,” he said. “But ultimately, we are a great university with a great tradition, not a school full of individuals.”
And for his team, when the pads are put on and the lights are switched on, the Zach Banner that many know and love transforms. And when that happens, no one is safe.
“I become the Incredible Hulk,” Banner says. “Everyone dies. Hulk smash.”
Great write up … it’s spot on.

The Trojans not only have the great fortune of opening up their season against two teams from the Sun Belt Conference, but also the pleasure of playing both of those games at home. Props to Steve Sarkisian for pulling this one off, especially because the remainder of the team’s schedule should prove to be rather grueling.
These first couple of games actually remind me a lot of my feelings toward certain colored Starburst candies. No disrespect to the Sunbelt Conference, but home matchups against Arkansas State and Idaho are analogous to the pink and red Starbursts — the ones that you wish you could have more of, but run out quickly so you have to settle for the most undesirable colors like the orange and yellow ones.
After Saturday’s game, the team’s season will be filled with these orange and yellow Starbursts that signify road games at Arizona State, Oregon and Notre Dame.
The reason I use this candy analogy in order to demonstrate the Trojans’ rigorous schedule is because of the large bundle of young and raw talent that this year’s USC team possesses.
Twenty three players made their debuts in a USC uniform last Saturday and 13 of those players were true freshmen. Many of them didn’t only play, but made impact plays at their respective positions.
Freshman tailback Ronald Jones, backing up Tre Madden in place of Justin Davis, rushed for 86 yards and took one 44 yards for the first touchdown of his USC career. Fellow freshman running back Aca’Cedric Ware also found the end zone.
Even young defenders got theirs as freshman linebacker Osa Masina recovered a fumble off a backwards pass and took it back 46 yards for a score.
It was also great to see Cameron Smith become the first true freshman to start an opener for USC since Riki Gray in 1978, in addition to Iman Marshall seeing a significant amount of time at defensive back in his freshman debut after Adoree’ Jackson went down.
These freshmen have made the most of their playing time in these first two “gimme” games because they’re going to need all of the confidence and experience they can get heading into the rest of the season.
Just about the same time last year, USC marched undefeated into Boston College, fresh off a big win in Palo Alto against Stanford.
Victimized by a lack of depth, the Trojans broke down in Beantown and were upset by the Eagles, which appropriately set the theme for the team’s season — not being able to finish games.
I specifically remember watching cornerback Jonathan Lockett, then a true freshman, being thrown into the game, given the absence of Josh Shaw, and having a great deal of trouble covering Eagles receivers in the second half.
Now that Sarkisian has his depth, he needs to make sure that his “fabulous freshmen” are ready to be thrown into these type of hostile environments later in the season.
Recall another group of fabulous freshmen in the early 1990s when the University of Michigan’s “Fab Five” took the nation by storm when they reached the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Championship.
As a unit, USC’s freshmen won’t have to bear the same responsibility that the “Fab Five” did, but it’s important for them to realize that with all of the hype they’ve received ever since their class signed with USC, also comes an expectation to perform.
It seems like this group of freshmen has passed the test so far through just one game, but it has a whole season still to show why they were one of the best recruiting classes in the nation.
The Trojans Pac-12 title hopes could very well fall on these freshmen, and it’s important that they are ready for the spotlight.

Cody Kessler and JuJu Smith-Schuster would like everyone to know that neither of them wears the same pair of underwear every game. In fact, you won’t find them doing much of anything one might consider superstitious.
Game day can become a routine, and even though these players insist that they don’t buy into the hype, both definitely follow their own routines to get ready for every game. Prayer, food and music are staples of the Trojan football ritual before every game.
When asked whether or not they were superstitious, both players had very different reactions.
“This might sound contradictory, but I feel like I’m not superstitious, but I never go against it,” Kessler said. “If something works I’m not going to go against it, but I’m not going to overthink it. I won’t wear the same underwear every time, but I get in a routine.”
Smith-Schuster said that though Kessler might not consider himself superstitious, he has a clear game day style.
“Cody has the same dress style every time we play,” Smith-Schuster said, referring to the half shirt Kessler wears under his jersey and leg sleeve under his knee brace. “He probably doesn’t even recognize it.”
Far before the players get dressed for the game, though, Smith-Schuster is beginning his preparation. He begins every Saturday with a workout, either solitary or with a teammate.
“What I usually do is I wake up in the morning, I work out by myself or with a teammate, and the workout is different every time,” Smith-Schuster said. “I jog for 10 minutes on the treadmill, and then I lift and get a quick pump in —  both legs and upper body.”
Following this light workout, Smith-Schuster packs in the calories with his favorite breakfast food: chocolate croissants.
“I’ll have one or two, depending on the day. Or maybe three,” he said.
Smith-Schuster also revealed his longest standing game day tradition: eating Mambas, a fruit chew candy Smith-Schuster said has been part of his game day since he was a senior in high school.
“I’ll eat some before the game, and I eat some at halftime,” Smith-Schuster said.
Both Kessler and Smith-Schuster emphasized that they try to relax long before kickoff. This can consist of what a lot of other USC students do before the game: watch college football. Smith-Schuster also revealed that he will go for a brief walk around the USC neighborhood or wherever the hotel is during away games. But he insists he doesn’t stray far from the hotel in an unfamiliar area.
He will also call his mom to talk and pray with her before getting ready for the game. As the day progresses and the team starts getting ready for the game, the music begins to become more apparent in each individual player’s routine despite the fact that the locker room is already rocking.
“In the locker room we listen to music,” Kessler said. “We have a playlist that we know guys are getting pumped up to.”
In addition to the ambient noise, players will often have their own personalized playlists that get them going.
“I’ll listen to up-tempo house music; it gets the blood flowing,” Kessler said. “But then right before we go out I’ll slow it down to calm me down.”
Smith-Schuster listens to The XX, an indie pop band that he said helps him focus.
“It helps me think about what’s going to go on,” he said. “So you can visualize the game in your head.”
Smith-Schuster also revealed that fellow wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr.’s game day music consists primarily of Beyoncé, with “Halo” being the main song.
The final dominant aspect of the pregame routine that seems to be consistent throughout the team is prayer.
In addition to Smith-Schuster’s time praying with his mother, once the players get into the Coliseum, they huddle up and receive a pep talk from head coach Steve Sarkisian.
Following that pep talk, the entire team is led in prayer.
Smith-Schuster said that this particular USC team is very religious and prayer is a large part of their pregame routine both together and individually.
Smith-Schuster said that a lot of the position groups such as the defensive linemen and their coach will get together and pray as a unit.
Another group that will assemble to pray together is a group of Samoans that are on the team.
Smith-Schuster himself is half Samoan, and he prays alongside offensive linemen Damien Mama, Toa Lobendahn and Viane Talamaivao as well as linebackers Osa Masina and Olajuwon Tucker and some of the Samoan coaches.
Students and fans may recognize this emphasis on prayer immediately following the team’s energetic burst from the tunnel onto the field as many players will head for the end zone and bow on one knee in prayer.
Though Smith-Schuster and Kessler are not superstitious fanatics, it is easy to say that each has found a comfortable routine with which they are confident.
Great story Hailey!  Love the opening line! Love, Mom

After a convincing 55-6 win over Arkansas State in last week’s season opener, the Trojans (1-0) return to the Coliseum to host the Idaho Vandals (0-1).
While the Trojans are sitting on top of the Pac-12 with last week’s win, the Vandals fell to the bottom of the Sun Belt conference with a 45-28 loss to Ohio last week.
The Trojans’ 49-point victory over Idaho’s Sun Belt opponent Arkansas State does not bode well for the Vandals heading into Saturday’s matchup. USC has won all nine previous matchups against Idaho.
Though the Vandals suffered a tough loss, wide receiver Dezmon Epps nearly broke a school record with 15 receptions for the night, a national best. Safety Chris Hawkins will have the difficult task of containing Epps though Hawkins looked capable with last week’s interception and fumble recovery.
Cody Kessler’s No. 1 target, JuJu Smith-Schuster, kicked off his sophomore campaign with four catches for 89 yards.
Idaho, who like Arkansas State is a member of the Sun Belt Conference, allowed 489 yards against Ohio, but will need to make some adjustments on defense to stop Smith-Schuster and a dynamic Pac-12 offense.
Smith-Schuster even admitted that despite a commanding win, the Trojans were still not at their best.
“After we beat Arkansas State, I felt like my teammates, they kind of took it easy,” Smith-Schuster said. “It was kind of sluggish … To be honest, I even came out kind of sluggish.”
For Kessler to be an effective quarterback, the Trojans will need to resolve the issues with the offensive line. Kessler was sacked five times against Arkansas State, exposing some gaping holes in USC’s pass protection.
Idaho’s defense gave up nearly 500 yards and hardly poses a threat to Max Tuerk and the offensive line, but the Trojans will need to make improvements before they face Stanford next week.
“I would suspect that we were able to teach a lot off of [the Arkansas State] video,” run game coordinator Bob Connelly said. “A lot of learning opportunities off that film.”
Though Kessler’s protection was concerning, it didn’t faze him for the most part.
Kessler displayed why he is on the watchlist for the Heisman, completing 73 percent of his passes and throwing four touchdowns to no interceptions.
However, despite a talented receiving corps, Kessler struggled to connect on deep balls last week, overthrowing open receivers.
“It wasn’t about delivery or arm motion or things like that, it was just continually staying on him about his feet,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “It’s not a light switch; we’re going to keep doing it day after day after day so that come Saturday he’s back into that groove of where I think he can play at.”
Idaho will be led by sophomore quarterback Matt Linehan, who went 36 for 48 last week against Ohio. He threw one touchdown pass and two interceptions.
Linehan will need to make big adjustments if he plans to stay on his feet against the likes of Su’a Cravens and Chris Hawkins.
Cornerback Adoree’ Jackson left last week’s game with a strained abdominal muscle but is expected to play on Saturday. Tailback Justin Davis, who suffered from a rib injury, is also expected to play on Saturday.
The Vandals won only one game last season and are coming off a big loss to a mediocre opponent.
The Trojans are heavily favored to win this matchup, but have been blindsided by underdogs before. Sarkisian emphasized that the Trojans have a lot to improve on before they take the field against Idaho.
“I think we can really speed things up, get more snaps and that will help us down the road,” Sarkisian said.
Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. The game will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.

Fans at the season opener last week against Arkansas State might have noticed some competition for the traditional hot dog vendors outside the Coliseum. The Pasadena-based gourmet sausage chain Dog Haus will be serving hot dogs and sausages at all USC home games this season near Gate 16.
“The group that basically owns the food stalls at the Coliseum … was looking for a new, fresh face, someone to come into the Coliseum, and they reached out to us about Dog Haus,” said Kristin Hansel, senior account executive of JS2 Communications, the firm that represents Dog Haus. “[With] them being Pasadena-based, franchising nationally at the moment and just with a signature item to sports games [like] hot dogs and sausages, it seemed like a great fit. They met and did a walk-through and basically with a two-day turnaround they were at the first game.”
Dog Haus will be serving three signature dogs and sausages at the Coliseum. The “Long Snap Dog” with cheese sauce, bacon and green onions; the “Buffalo Soldier,” a chicken sausage with buffalo sauce, blue cheese and crumbled BBQ chips; and the “Thai Breaker,” a spicy Thai sausage with peanut sauce, crushed peanuts and toasted coconut. Side items include tater tots with optional toppings.
“The items they are offering at the Coliseum are completely unique to that location; they are not served at any of the restaurants,” Hansel said. “Obviously, at all of their locations, they have it built around options, so theoretically they could be recreated. But, they are not menu items anywhere right now.”
Originally from Pasadena, Dog Haus has now opened locations in six states -— Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, and Utah. Hansel said that Dog Haus will be opening a new eatery near USC, in the space previously occupied by Freebirds World Burrito.
“Their timeline is that they’ll be open next month,” she said. “But we can’t narrow it down anymore than that.”

Professors from the Rossier School of Education submitted a panel proposal to the South by Southwest Edu 2016 Conference and Festival. Community voting closed this week for the panel, which is entitled “Teaching Integrated STEM in Teacher Education.” The chosen panels will be announced by SXSWedu on Oct. 21.
If chosen, the panel will feature Professors Corinne Hyde, Fred Freking, Anthony Maddox and John Pascarella of the Rossier School. The event is organized by Michelle Manno, the communications manager for the Rossier School of Education’s online teaching degree.
“We’re doing a lot of innovative things at Rossier School of Education, and we just want to share the work that we’re doing,” Freking said. “Forums like this are a good opportunity to share our ideas with our colleagues.”
The panel, as proposed, will discuss changes in teacher education due to Next Generation Science Standards, a multi-state effort to establish new standards for science education. The speakers will share their ideas on how to create a science, technology, engineering and math curriculum that will equip teachers with the necessary skills for the classroom.
“What was typically taught was hands-on activities and doing things and doing science, and the new emphasis is really thinking on things and a more metacognitive approach to teaching science,” Manno said. “More and more professions are looking for the skills that are taught in STEM education.”
The panel will inform attendees of the differences between synchronous and asynchronous online learning, as well as what students are expected to do in an integrated STEM curriculum. The panel will also examine the value of online STEM teacher education programs.
The panelists cited educators’ resistance to change and students’ disconnect with science as the most pressing obstacles to implementing an integrated STEM curriculum.
“I hope … the discussion will bring up ideas and perspectives and definitions, and will allow people who attend to grab onto new ideas, […] to find out ways in which they can … explore on their own,” Maddox said.
SXSWedu, which will run from March 7-10 next year, is an annual conference in Austin, Texas, that features content from a diverse array of speakers with backgrounds in education.
“I attended last year, and after all the panels that I first began watching and the workshops that I did, I was like, ‘this is such a great opportunity for us here to … connect with teachers and STEM professionals on another level outside of people that are in our school,’” Manno said.
SXSW allows anyone to submit a panel proposal and then encourages people to vote for their favorite panel ideas. Community votes and approval by the SXSW staff each constitute 30 percent of the final decision while the opinions of the SXSW Programming Committee make up the remaining 40 percent.

Despite a consistent effort by universities to advertise study abroad to all students, research shows that undergraduate study abroad programs — both at USC and nationally — are primarily dominated by female students.
Data compiled by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences shows that in the 2014-15 school year, 70 percent of Dornsife study abroad students were female, while only 30 percent were male — despite the school’s fairly even female to male ratio of 51 to 49 percent. This number has improved slightly since 2012, when 77 percent of Dornsife study abroad students were female.
These findings are not specific to USC undergraduate programs. In fact, data retrieved from the Institute of International Education profiling U.S. study abroad students for the 2012-2013 school year found that nationally 65.3 percent of study abroad students were female.
Kyron Jacques, a senior who studied abroad his junior year in Madrid, said that the uneven gender distribution was obvious in his abroad experience. His first semester there were about 22 females to three males in his program, whereas his second semester there were about 23 females to three males.
Jacques said the experience of being one of the few men could easily be alienating for some people.
“[One example] is that there would be times when we were out and my group would go to the women’s restroom, and I would be left alone in a bar in a foreign country,” he said.
In the 2006 comprehensive study “The Gender Gap: in Post-Secondary Study Abroad,” Steven W. Shirley of the University of North Dakota, researched reasons for this gender gap, and possible solutions to better market such abroad opportunities to male students.
One main reason, Shirley postulates, is the possibility that a person’s major can be a factor as to why more females study abroad than males. Senior John Zamora, who is studying in Paris this semester, explained that he thought a lot of his friends’ academic schedules held them back from taking advantage of USC’s study abroad programs.
“A lot of my friends happen to be pre-med or pre-law, and they don’t really have space for a study abroad program,” Zamora said.
Senior Kevin Tsukii, who is currently studying abroad in Madrid, also mentioned that “major is definitely important” in whether or not someone chooses to study abroad.
However, despite the commonly held belief that field of study might play a major role in gender discrepancies in abroad programs, research might show field of study has less pull than we believe.
According to Shirley’s study, over time there has been a significant increase in study abroad participation in traditional “male-focused” fields of study — like engineering and physical sciences — and a decrease in study abroad participation in traditional “female-focused” fields of study — like humanities, social sciences and fine/applied arts. Despite the increases in “male-focused” and decreases in “female-focused” majors going abroad, the overall percentage of males and females abroad has remained fairly constant.
However, Shirley’s study did find that males more strongly felt studying abroad delayed their potential graduation date than females did. Yet according to Dornsife study abroad advisor Vito Grillo, there is still not one explanation for why females study abroad more than males.
“There is much speculation as to why more females study abroad than males, but there is no definitive answer,” Grillo wrote in an email.
Still, the idea that one’s career or personal life could be improved by an experience abroad seems to be a contributing factor as to why people go abroad. Tsukii, for example, said that one of his reasons for studying in Madrid is because he is interested in possibly doing immigration reporting in L.A. and being comfortably fluent in Spanish would be extremely beneficial.
“Language is such an important part of journalism. Journalism relies on your ability to ask a certain person a question and for them to understand,” he said.
Similarly, Jacques believes part of the reason he chose to study abroad is that he is interested in nonprofits and global business.
“Something I’ve learned after going abroad is how you’re treated different when you’re more familiar with the culture or you speak a certain language,” Jacques said. “I found that I am able to express a different personality when I am speaking Spanish versus when I’m speaking English — and I think that people can pick up on that because you’re able to communicate a certain way.”
Zamora, a senior majoring in international relations, agreed that his school focus encouraged an abroad experience.
“As an IR student, I think it would be a great experience learning about European politics and discovering more in this region of the world,” he said.
Zamora is currently in the USC Paris program as one of four men in a group of 12 — a more even gender distribution than the previous semester when there were 12 women to one man. Zamora said that he thinks there might be cultural differences that make study abroad appeal to a more female crowd.
“I think most girls romanticize the idea of going abroad — the idea that going abroad will be the time of your life,” Zamora said.
He also said that he thinks there are more movies of women than men going abroad. On the contrary, he thinks that males might rather just stay on campus and create memories, or foundations, that are more permanent.
“Maybe [guys] don’t feel the need to have an external experience because USC is already a new place. They don’t necessarily need to be abroad to make those memories,” he said.
Similarly, Will Hanley, a senior who studied abroad last spring in London as one of four males out of about 40 students in the communication program, decided to study abroad partly to change his routine. But, he said some of his friends who chose not to go abroad “were perfectly content with their routines back home.”
One point that Hanley brought up, however, is that he noticed that he’s seen a lot fewer men go abroad when they don’t know anyone in their respective programs.
“I rarely see a solo guy going somewhere alone. But I have seen a lot of big groups of guys going [abroad] together,” he said.
Hanley said that if his male friends had gone abroad, they would have had to go alone without any friends in their program.
But, Hanley believes more women go in organized groups or are simply more comfortable going by themselves and making new friends. Zamora noticed a similar trend, pointing out that “girls tend to study abroad with other girls.” Jacques agreed.
“[If you’re a guy] and you choose to go abroad, you’re going to be a minority, and that can be alienating for some guys,” he said.
One finding of Shirley’s study is that the influence of parents is not as strong in the decision-making process of males. Hanley said that his parents’ encouragement helped him in his final decision to spend the semester abroad.
“I think it was one of the things about USC that [my parents] were most excited about since the beginning,” Hanley said.
Jacques said that in his experience, not only had his parents been encouraging, but going abroad was always part of the plan.
“There was always the assumption that I would study abroad. It was a natural part of college for me,” he said.
Nevertheless, research is not conclusive as to why females are more likely to go abroad than males, but Shirley’s study does suggest that study abroad advisors ensure they communicate the correct information to male students.
“In many cases, courses taken during a semester or year abroad can fit precisely into a student’s curricular plan, and those details must be addressed and confirmed well in advance of the student ever heading abroad,” Shirley wrote.
Grillo said in an email that his team does need to convince more males that studying abroad is important and a worthwhile undertaking.
“I think if more males realized how study abroad can make their resume stand out, more would take a serious look at it,” he wrote.

Since July 27, when he began work as the new associate director of retail operations for Hospitality, Lee has made it a habit of getting to know everyone who works under him, a philosophy he developed in an area far removed from the academic environment of the university — the fast-paced world of professional sports. Managing hospitality operations for teams all over Southern California, Lee said, got him started in the hospitality industry — and kindled his passion for innovation and progress.
“What I love about professional sports is the fact that the fans’ experiences and expectations change every single year,” Lee said. “The fun part is being able to challenge yourself and your team every year to bring out the innovations to see what kind of fun and crazy things you can do.”
Lee spent 11 years working at sports arenas, from Angel Stadium, home of the Empire 66ers, to Qualcomm Stadium, where he spent four years with the San Diego Chargers. Even earlier, before he was introduced to the world of sports hospitality, Lee spent four years managing various locations of the popular Claim Jumper restaurant chain in San Bernardino. However, before the management positions, at restaurants, sports stadiums and now at Hospitality, Lee started out exactly like the people he now oversees: as a service worker.
“I started flipping omelets the day I turned 16,” Lee said.
It’s this humble start that drives Lee’s employee-centered approach, where his focus is on drawing his team together, supporting each person’s growth and encouraging innovative ideas.
“I’ve always known that my passion was within the hospitality industry,” Lee said. “That’s what I like to do — work with people, develop people and have fun doing it.”
As associate director, Lee works directly with nine managers who manage the 22 different retail venues throughout both of the University’s campuses — the University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus. Though daily operations involve keeping each venue running smoothly, Lee’s main focus is on expansion: He’s always looking forward, planning what can be done and working to put it into action.
“A lot of the job is future planning because of the constant expansion of the campus,” Lee said. “Brainstorming, really trying to find ways to take the student and faculty experience with Hospitality to the next level.”
According to Lee, this idea of expansion and innovation is what drew him to USC in the first place.
“[I was drawn to] the passion that the hospitality team here has for innovating and trying to lead the way for the next generation,” Lee said. “The sky’s the limit with this type of environment and having the freedom to make conceptual ideas and turn them into reality is one of the most exciting things [about working here].”
Kris Klinger, Lee’s supervisor and vice president of retail operations at USC, believes that Lee’s vision makes him more than just a competent manager.
“He’s doing what a great leader does,” Klinger said. “He’s assessing and spending a lot of time with his team members, understanding why they do what they do and how they’re doing it.”
Aside from his work with USC, Lee also sits on the Board of Directors of Juma Ventures, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps kids in urban areas overcome poverty and work toward a college education. Lee’s involvement is, according to him, a product of his belief in helping his community.
“It’s very rewarding to be able to be part of [the process] and see some of the youth who, without the support of a company like Juma, would go down the wrong path,” Lee said. “Making a positive impact on students is what [I’m passionate] about.”
Just as he sees a future for the students he helps through Juma Ventures, Lee clearly envisions a future for USC — and works to implement it every day through his work with USC Hospitality.
“The goal is to be able to create the ultimate experience for the students,” Lee said.

I think a lot of people do not enjoy the classical music genre, because they believe it to be synonymous with antiquated sounds that are neither easy nor fun for the ears and mind to digest. Though I’m not a fan of every piece of classical music and am by no means an aficionado, I do appreciate the occasional concerto or symphony. I’ve found that the flow of the rich, non-lyric sounds helps inspire me while I write a paper in the philosophy library and alleviates the urge to pull my hair out in the basement of Leavey during finals.
Classical music is also pretty badass, passionate and, in some cases, violent — think Wagner’s The Ride of the Valkyries in  Apocalypse Now. And the recent use of compositions like Beethoven’s Symphony No.7 in A Major, Op.92 – II, Allegretto in several episodes of USA’s rookie hacker drama, Mr. Robot, could suggest that the genre is ‘trending up’ in contemporary relevance.
This playlist comprises a selection of my favorites to listen to while studying or wanting to feel like a badass OR a combination of the two:

It’s so nice to see a useful post regarding classical music in a university publication, and thanks for the playlist – it looks like a good one.  But “contemporary relevance”? The use or disuse of classical music in media and popular culture cannot be considered an effective barometer for relevance. Since when is popularity an indicator of artistic or cultural merit?

With the latest release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Hideo Kojima ends his role as director and creator of the 28-year-old franchise. Having elevated the position of video games to a legitimate art form in the eyes of many, the series has sparked debate and has been used as a key piece of evidence that proves video games are a legitimate art form. The Phantom Pain is a true testament to Hideo Kojima’s brilliance and features the best gameplay to date out of the entire series.
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain features gameplay on a scale that has never been attempted before with its open-world capabilities. Players will be dumbfounded at how much content is actually packed into this game. Playing as the character Snake, a.k.a. Big Boss, the player is tasked with rebuilding a base that was destroyed in the prologue, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, and gaining enough resources and personnel to get revenge on those who destroyed it in the first place. To do this, the players must complete the main missions that advance the narrative and will ultimately wrap up the entire series. To make these missions easier, however, players are encouraged to do a number of side activities that can be accomplished at any time in the game. For instance, on a mission in which Snake has to rescue a prisoner, they can interrogate the enemy to make the prisoner’s whereabouts known. In order to do this, players need to have previously recruited a language interpreter who speaks the language of the enemy in that specific area. Doing so will let players understand what the enemy is saying, despite speaking a completely different language. This doesn’t have to be done and is completely up to players. Players are still able to search high and low for the prisoner, but being able to understand the enemy’s language will cut the time spent searching considerably.
This is just one example of how much freedom players are given in regard to how they approach a mission: Players can infiltrate at any time of day in the game thanks to a day-night cycle, creating an endless number of playing styles. The players can refer to the previous installments of the series and sneak their way through an entire mission without setting off an alarm or making contact with the enemy whatsoever. Or, in a departure from previous Metal Gear themes, players can go in guns blazing and kill anything that moves while still being able to complete the objective and not getting punished for it. Longtime fans will know that in the games before The Phantom Pain, stealth was key — getting spotted nearly meant game over and killing the enemy instead of taking a non-lethal option would come back to haunt the player later. Kojima wanted to make the game more accessible to players by not punishing them for being creative with how they chose to infiltrate, so setting off an alarm and racking up the body count is just as legitimate of a play-style as slipping in and out as if the player was never there. The Artificial Intelligence is the most intelligent it has ever been in a Metal Gear game, so the player must take many things into account before acting on their plan. Shooting everything isn’t always the best way to get things done, but it is an option.
The only punishment for killing enemies is losing the ability to recruit soldiers for players’ Mother Base. Throughout the game, players have the ability to build up their Mother Base with different platforms that aid the player in different ways. For example, the research and development staff will unlock more customizable weapons and gadgets for the player and allies to the player to use that will make missions considerably easier. If the player feels that a sniper is needed for an upcoming mission, they can have the R&D team develop it. R&D isn’t the only team on Mother Base, and the player will undoubtedly be amazed at just how much thought went into making each individual’s experience with the game a unique one. The way to expand the staff is to recruit them, which is accomplished by loading them on a chopper, or using the Fulton Recovery System, where the player ties a balloon onto a soldier that is humorously lifted in the air with great force and transported to Mother Base. Different soldiers are skilled in different categories, so if players come across a soldier with high stats in one area, it’s up to players how they want to make their next move. They could kill him, permanently removing him as a threat, but players lose a potentially skilled recruit that will aid them later on in the game.
One of the major selling points of this game is watching Mother Base grow as the player collects resources to expand it. Players have the option of visiting their own Mother Base and seeing the progress and growth that has occurred as a direct result of the player’s actions. Players are able to interact with the staff, see the vehicles and weapons they’ve extracted and visit all the platforms and units they’ve sunk their hard-earned cash into. If players don’t visit their base for a while or run low on in-game currency, the staff’s morale will drop, and the staff may resort to infighting, which can result in the hospitalization of staff members. The player can also connect online and manage a Forward Operating Base that will help players in the same way Mother Base does, but it is susceptible to other players online who want to invade and steal other players’ resources. This is an optional part of the game, and players can turn it off if they choose, and it is likely a taste of what the online functionality will be like in the future.
Hideo Kojima is a visionary. He has done for video games what directors like Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola have done for movies: created legendary art to be critiqued and adored by critics, scholars and fans alike. His legacy with the Metal Gear franchise will be remembered, and The Phantom Pain is truly the best contender for game of the year so far. As for what’s next for Kojima, it’s not set in stone. After a tense unknown snafu with Konami, the company that has been releasing the Metal Gear games, it is expected that Kojima will leave the company soon. He has stated that he would like to make games that are catered to the indie market or some other game that is separate from the stealth genre. Whatever he decides, he will no doubt be successful in his future endeavors. His run on the series will never be forgotten, and gamers everywhere owe him their sincerest thanks.

There aren’t many issues that are less funny than mental illness and suicide. Yet somehow, author Nick Hornby manages to take one of the most serious issues in contemporary society and make it laugh-out-loud hilarious, without dismissing its crippling reality.
I am a big Hornby fan, and About a Boy has long been one of my favorite books. That was part of the reason I decided to read his novel A Long Way Down this summer. The other part was because mental illness and psychology is something I have always found interesting and important to our culture. I was not disappointed. Hornby’s story is at the same time hilarious and tragic, heartwarming and heartwrenching. The plot follows four characters who could not seem more different from one another. Martin Sharp is a failed TV personality and talk show host whose career took a nosedive after sordid details of his private life were released to the public. Maureen is a single mother who lives alone with her severely mentally disabled son. Jess is a rambunctious, troubled teenager who is dealing with a bad breakup. JJ is an American musician whose band has just broken up. Only one thing ties these eclectic cast of characters together: on New Year’s Eve, they all decide to commit suicide. It so happens that all four characters chose to end their lives by jumping off the same rooftop. However, once they encounter each other, the moment becomes awkward. Slowly, they all start to talk and decide to postpone their suicides.
Part of what I love about Hornby’s humor is how dark and real it is. He isn’t going to tiptoe around the truth or make a joke that has already been told. Part of how he accomplishes this is by switching perspectives each chapter between the four protagonists. Each has his or her own comically unique voice and criticisms of the others. For example, JJ describes the rest of the group as “a middle-aged woman who looked like someone’s cleaning lady, a shrieking adolescent lunatic and a talk show host with an orange face … It didn’t add up. Suicide wasn’t invented for people like this. It was invented for people like Virginia Woolf and Nick Drake. And Me. Suicide was supposed to be cool.” His sarcastic quips and uncanny observations make for a gorgeously readable narrative.
Still, as with most comedy, underneath all the humor is something very real and important. Hornby doesn’t shy away from the issue at hand, and some of his observations about mental illness are not only deeply poignant, but also completely honest. He describes the inner conflict and incredible suffering that is experienced by those struggling with mental illness.
“A man who wants to die feels angry and full of life and desperate and bored and exhausted, all at the same time; he wants to fight everyone, and he wants to curl up in a ball and hide in a cupboard somewhere. He wants to say sorry to everyone, and he wants everyone to know just how badly they’ve all let him down.”
I think that what makes this book so profound and what makes me recommend it so ardently has a lot to do with its cultural relevance. In 2014, Newsweek reported that about 18.2 percent of the American population suffers from some form of mental illness, making it one of the most common illnesses and leading causes of death in the country. While A Long Way Down is set in Hornby’s home town of London, the statistics here are very similar, with one in four people experiencing a mental health problem in England every year, according to mind.org.
What is so admirable in this book is that Hornby recognizes that mental illness can affect anyone of any age or gender from any walk of life. The contrast between the arrogant, middle-class and middle-aged TV host, and the quiet, beaten-down single mother is staggering, and yet still they find each other in the same situation. A Long Way Down emphasizes that nobody is immune to mental anguish and everybody has his or her own crosses to bear.
Hornby isn’t vocally advocating for any type of mental health reform or taking a political stance. Instead, he is simply showing the reader how the world looks from people whose lives feel unlivable. They are far from perfect, but they are relatable and deeply human. With an issue like mental illness that is coming more and more into the public consciousness, it is easy to get lost in statistics and data and forget that there are people who suffer not just from mental illness, but from the stigma and prejudices that come along with it. Hornby goes some way toward dispelling these preconceptions. He shows the people behind the news headlines, and he tells their stories and does it all while making you laugh.
—-the stigma and prejudices that come along with it
You call someone’s prejudice my stigma, I call it their prejudice.
What it comes down to is whose voice matters.

On Friday, the Los Angeles Philharmonic unveiled VAN Beethoven, a new virtual reality experience that allows its patrons to immerse themselves within the sounds of the L.A. Phil Set up in a trailer van, the VAN Beethoven experience uses new Oculus technology that surrounds its viewers in 360-degree virtual reality in which Gustavo Dudamel, musical and artistic director for the L.A. Phil, conducts the beginning fragments from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5. The entire experience lasts about four minutes.
The VAN Beethoven mobile experience is an undertaking to promote the L.A. Phil’s Immortal Beethoven Festival, in which Dudamel conducts all nine of Beethoven’s symphonies in sequence over the course of two weeks. All performances will take place at the Walt Disney Concert Hall from Oct. 1-13.
Shana Mathur, vice president of marketing and communications for the L.A. Phil, said plans for the project began last year.
“L.A. Phil created the idea,” Mathur said. “Initial planning began about a year ago, but most of the preparation happened within the last six months.”
The process of creating a musical virtual reality is new to Amy Seidenwurm, the L.A. Phil director of digital initiatives for the group, transformed the idea into a reality.
“We’re treating this very much like an experiment,” Seidenwurm said. “The overall reception [of VAN Beethoven] will determine if we decide to plan something similar in the future.”
With a total of five cameras, the filming process took a little over an hour, according to Seidenwurm. The orchestra performed all the music live, with each camera angle shot individually to avoid the clutter of equipment across the stage.
“We had to do each shot separately,” Seidenwurm said. “If we didn’t, because [the experience] is 360 degrees, it would look like a production set and not like a concert.”
Seidenwurm also emphasized that the experience would be enjoyable for everyone, even those not well-versed in classical music.
“In a lot of ways, this is meant to be an introduction to classical music for people who maybe don’t know or are intimidated [by classical music].”
VAN Beethoven will be touring the Los Angeles area from Sept. 11 through Oct. 18. A complete list of locations can be found online.

Upon entering Simbal, diners immediately know they’ve walked into something special. Located in a hidden enclave of an otherwise saturated and bustling plaza in Little Tokyo, the restaurant is the brainchild of former Top Chef contestant Shawn Pham, who opened Simbal in early June after returning from a four-year trip to Vietnam. Inspired by Pham’s Southeast Asian background and recent travels, Simbal incorporates a mix of Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese ingredients into its flavorful dishes, balancing out the cool backdrop of the restaurant’s striking concrete interior.
The minimalist, industrial decor is a byproduct of the location — the restaurant sits next to a multi-story parking garage. Clean, simple lines and an open concept give the restaurant a relaxed attitude and immediate cool factor. But the real star of the show is Simbal’s open kitchen, which is visible from almost any table in the room and gives patrons a unique view into the restaurant world. Simbal’s inventive use of space is only one indication of Pham’s creativity. Another is the restaurant’s dishes, a twist on the usual Southeast Asian cuisine, including traditional favorites like the banh mi salad, as well as unexpected options like the short rib pot pie.
The friendly staff is eager to explain Simbal’s inner workings and untraditional menu, even offering to have the chef create something special just for the table. Plates are served tapas-style and are meant to share, so guests are encouraged to order two to three dishes each. In addition to its standard menu, the restaurant offers several off-the-menu items, which are wheeled around on dim sum carts and presented to patrons throughout their meals.
One off-the-menu option, the mushroom salad, earned high praise from the staff. Featuring several different mushrooms, the dish is a mix of familiar and unexpected notes. Each mushroom seems to complement the next, varying in size, texture and taste. The plate’s fish sauce offers a flavorful kick to the array of mushrooms, completing the dish with a spice to be expected from Southeast Asian cuisine. The portion of the mushroom salad was perhaps the most satisfying part of the dish — the plate was large enough to share but not overwhelming — the perfect amount of spice to start the meal.
The spiciness of the mushroom salad is best paired with the tangy sweetness of Simbal’s tofu and tuna dish, served with ponzu, sesame and scallions. A great indication of the restaurant’s innovative flavor, the dish’s fresh tofu and tuna complement each other flawlessly. While the tuna provided the dish’s texture, the tofu is incredibly soft, cutting with the slightest pressure of a utensil and infused with ponzu for a smooth, flavorful bite. Though small, the plate is a solid starter and good representation of Simbal’s signature style.
A recommendation by the server was another off-the-menu creation: a vegetarian dish with crispy tofu. Though proposed as more of an entree-sized plate, the serving is quite small and, unfortunately, so is the flavor. The crispy tofu provides a nice contrast in texture, but the rest of the dish lacks in spice and substance. The server initially promised a mixture of tofu and eggplant; however, it was immediately clear that the eggplant was absent with a dish of tofu arranged solely on the left half of the plate. A confusion to say the least, the tofu dish served as a small hiccup in an otherwise satisfying and flavorful meal.
The real standout and savior at Simbal is the restaurant’s southeast Asian twist on the short rib pot pie, with lemongrass, annatto and beef tendon. Though a larger vegetable-to-meat ratio could be expected, the generous portion of short rib is certainly not a disappointment. Cooked to perfection, the juicy short rib provides a great texture to the base of the pot pie but was not outdone by the crust. Flaky and toasty, the pie’s crust is anything but dry, and worthy of its own special mention. A creative use of ingredients and flavors on a classic of another culture, the short rib pot pie certainly showcased the innovation Simbal promised.
Simbal’s menu prices are quite reasonable, but a fair warning — plates are small and a 20 percent service charge is applied to all checks. Combined, these factors can quickly transform a typical dinner into a pricey feast — something to be considered for students on a budget. For those looking for a true twist on the traditional offerings of Little Tokyo. However, a splurge might be worth it to experience the innovative mix of cultural flavors Simbal has to offer.

You are bound to find at least one of these six types of students in each of your classes. Cynthia Tice | Daily Trojan
As the final day to add and drop classes is on the horizon and introductions are over, lectures and discussion sections are in full force. We’re slowly but surely remembering what it’s like to take notes, and we’re accepting that our first assignments are due in about a week or two. For most of us, we’re about to cross paths yet again with the classmates who make lectures bearable, or at least entertaining, a reminder that college classes are all pretty similar because of these six people that you’ll likely find in most of your classes.
1.) The texter
This person isn’t particularly unique, and we all more or less fall into this category. However, this is a special shout out to the person whose eyes never leave his or her phone from the beginning of the lecture to the very end. They generally sit in the back, but some are bold enough to sit in the middle or even up front and have their phones in plain view. Some have a notebook out for effect while others know no notes will be taken. One may argue, why waste your time even coming to class if you walk in with the intention of not paying attention? But there are many things that can’t be explained by college student logic.
2.) The online shopper
We’re all guilty of browsing the web in class, obviously. This particular person is always interesting though because they do it every class through the entire class. The page isn’t minimized for slow parts of the lecture either. The best part, however, is the fact that they never add anything to their cart or proceed to checkout. They just scroll for an hour and 20 minutes, occasionally point something out to their friend for their opinion and go about their day when class is over. As the onlooker, you also find that you missed most of the lecture because you were too busy thinking about the clothes that this student was looking at. If any guys think they’re exempt from this, searching for shoes, electronics or building fantasy teams is essentially the same thing.
3.) The disputer
This person usually doesn’t make an appearance until later in the semester when the weight of all their assignments comes down on them, and they simply are not taking anything from anybody. They will talk about how they haven’t learned anything in the class and feel unprepared for the midterm. They are the ones who raise their hand and say, “We never talked about that,” or “that wasn’t on the syllabus,” or “that wasn’t on Blackboard.” We secretly love these people though because we’re either thinking the same thing, or it results in things getting moved around by a class vote.
4.) The participators
There are three types of participators. First, there is the person who thinks, “I am the smartest in the room.” This person will speak just for effect. They will comment on things that require no commentary, raise their hand before the professor is even done making a point and are prepared for a disagreement should they believe their point of view is being challenged. The pretension fills the room, but this person brings a little flavor to the class because no one can anticipate what new things they have to say, even when you think they’ve said it all.
There’s also the participator who just likes the sound of their own voice. This person also speaks for effect, but often doesn’t yield the effect they’re hoping for. You know the people who say a lot, but don’t actually make a point? They have a habit of saying a lot of nothing or reiterating the same point the person before them made, and the professor always responds with a long “yeah” and a lot of nodding. You sort of admire this person though because they never lose their courage to participate, and they’re one step ahead of you in the comfortable-with-public-speaking race. Third, there’s the student who just needs points for participation. This is pretty self-explanatory.
5.) The floater
These people just kind of exists in class. The majority of the class falls into this category, especially if this is a class where they know absolutely no one. They are somewhere between a slacker and a participator. They’ll chime in if they feel absolutely necessary but will otherwise browse on their laptop and occasionally write notes if something isn’t on the PowerPoint. In the event of a group project, they aren’t particularly eager to find a group, but also know that they have to temporarily subside their social awkwardness to fall into a nearby group (unless there’s an option to work solo, of course). This person reminds us that we are not alone in the, “I just want to get through this class,” struggle once or twice a week.
6.) The defender of USC
These people will only abide by the USC academic schedule. This means nothing can interfere with university holidays, major on-campus events or, most importantly, football games. They are not too shy to vocalize how assigning something during a weekend where most people will be gone or participating in a USC event will not only inconvenience the students, but the professor as well. Not many people really feel strongly about this, but they also don’t object to the potential of getting an assignment moved or removed altogether. Thank you, fellow Trojan!

Recently, I have become obsessed with hand jewelry, especially with rings. On an average day, I wear up to 10 rings: massive rings, phalange rings, even nail rings. The best part about my ring obsession is that stores are seemingly obsessed with this trend too. Upon entering stores like TopShop, Zara, Forever21, Abercrombie and Urban Outfitters, I often see a crazy variety of jewelry that will match with any imaginable outfit and nail color. Most of the items are on sale for reasonable prices, so the desire to purchase more and more just grows stronger. Here are some of the cool everyday jewelry items that a few of my favorite stores offer. They are easy to find, easy to buy and easy to mix!
H&M U-shaped Ring$5.99
 
Pearl rings from H&M have an interesting, modern look because of the two different sized pearls sitting on a finger. However, it also has a classy touch to it. This ring would go best with a bright red or burgundy color nail polish.
H&M 3-Pack Rings$4.99
 
While doing some online shopping in between my architecture classes, I came across this gorgeous hand chain on Topshop.com. This soft turquoise color would really pop in contrast with an edgy outfit. Consider wearing boyfriend jeans, Nike Air Max sneakers, white T-shirt and this cool hand chain.
TOPSHOP Pastel Stone Hand Chain$30
 
These long, joint rings are really great because they visually extend hands and make fingers look thinner, longer and more graceful. Wear with anything, anytime. These unique pieces are a must.
TOPSHOP Rhinestone Finger and Midi Ring$9
 
Ring sets are another popular item this season. Who said that there is a limit to the amount of rings you can wear at once? This Urban Outfitters ring set successfully mixes gold and silver, and incorporates patterns commonly seen in East Asian culture. These rings would look great with a plain dress and some necklaces. Don’t hesitate to wear all of the set together. There is no such thing as too many rings.
Urban Outfitters Collective Ring Set$24

On Sept. 16, the faculty senate will convene to consider a proposal to add a fall break to our university’s academic calendar.
Members of our university administration have expressed their concern regarding the impact of a fall break on our university’s academic integrity and standing. However, it is imperative our university administration and the faculty senate consider the well-being of students in USC’s mission to excel academically.
Our proposed fall break would preferably be placed on a Monday and Tuesday to maximize the impact on students. The addition of this proposed break would not reduce the 71 instructional days of the fall semester as the days would be added elsewhere to our academic calendar. Its purpose is to provide students a much needed break from the stressors of collegiate life.
The addition of a fall break is a mental health issue on our campus. Ninety-six percent of our students who responded to our survey believe a fall break would promote mental health by allowing students to rest, catch up on assignments, conduct job interviews and explore the greater community. With 24 out of the top 30 universities in the U.S. News and World Report having at least one day off in the 11-week period between Labor Day and Thanksgiving, we are lagging behind without a fall break.
Undergraduate Student Government’s advocacy efforts for a fall break started years ago. The vision to improve the well-being of our students through the addition of a fall break may become a reality this year. As students, we have done our part. It is time for USC to step up and care for our students’ health and wellness. This institution exists to serve its students and continues to do so from every student’s dime. We ask the members of the faculty senate, Provost Michael Quick, Vice Provost Dr. Ainsley Carry and President C. L. Max Nikias, who are now faced with the decision to grant this request, to listen to the voice of the student body.

Despite efforts to revamp the K-12 education system in Los Angeles, new standardized test results released by the California Department of Education have shown that Los Angeles Unified School District is suffering the most, with only 33 percent of students achieving target goals for math and 25 percent in English, according to the Los Angeles Times. And it seems — though the topic is highly contested — that Common Core is the underlying root of the issue at hand.
To USC students: If you consider the future of the workforce, the educational system for your children and the state of the economy, you’ll take this issue to heart. Angelenos are at the center of an educational crisis, but due to a failed program and the exhaustive efforts of politicians in support of a hollow program, students in LAUSD will in fact continue to suffer.
For the past several decades, the graduation rate in Los Angeles, specifically within LAUSD, has been strikingly low. It’s been so horrifying that LAUSD’s model of low retention, high dropout rates and low graduation rates are often used as examples of failed school districts. Even so, however, policy leaders in the state of California have implemented Common Core, unknowingly taking into consideration the full circle of ramifications that will follow generations of young, hard-working Angelenos, many of whom are part of a low to middle-class income tax bracket and part of a working minority. But after a tired trend of students performing well below their grade level, it’s clear that programs such as the Common Core are simply not feasible.
The Common Core program truly hurts the students it seeks to help. Though it strives to enforce and ensure a sense of security in terms of college readiness, what it really does in less affluent communities — with high schools known for low retention rates — is push students further away from achieving success.
Imagine asking a five-year-old child to ride his or her first bike with training wheels, then removing them without any notice two weeks later. The child would feel inadequate because the parent would most likely reprimand him or her for not understanding how to ride the bike without the training wheels. Not only is it impractical for the young child to quickly adapt to the changing surroundings, but it is also inconsiderate to expect the child would be able to do so. Throwing on the training wheels and quickly replacing them with real wheels never adequately prepared the child, but only made him or her fear using the new skills, him or her feel incompetent in a changing environment.
This sitation is what students in K-12 are facing across 42 states. In LAUSD, many students who are bilingual or participate in an English as a Second Language program will struggle with the burdens to prepare for college-level thinking and heavy analysis of societal issues at the age of six or seven. Common Core is not a cure-all — the curriculum isn’t flexible, it is not reasonable and it sure isn’t practical. Students should be prepared for success in a feasible manner that allows them to build upon learned skills. In the case of LAUSD, adopting Common Core will stray students even further away because of low pass rates and fear of inadequacy.
During the summer, many proponents of Common Core explained that the shift in curriculum for K-12 educators across the 42 states which have implemented the program have, in fact, produced better test results — but these results were later disproven by results released by the Department of Education. And more in-depth studies of student progress doled out within the past month reveal underlying issues with the new curriculum as students cannot adapt to the critical thinking-framed questions. But Common Core is just the beginning of the downward spiral for K-12 education, and it will continue to go south until educators, politicians and leaders recognize this default pattern of failure.
The overall drop in expected pass rates for students in K-12 this year in comparison to last displays a stark contrast between an already failing program to an extremely terrifying program. LAUSD, however, can revamp by increasing after-school programs and mentorships that enforce the likelihood of achieving student success. Students must be encouraged by their teachers and schoolwork. Common Core does the opposite. With the continued support of such a program, students in LAUSD will continue to drop out and the district will continue to be the model for a failed educational system.
Sarah Dhanaphatana is a junior majoring in political science.  She is also the deputy features editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Dhanapolitics,” runs Fridays.
Under ideal conditions it takes 7 years for an English Language Leaner to catch up with a native English speaker. Considering 80% of LAUSD students are ELL students and considering most LAUSD students live in less than ideal conditions many with no support from a non English speaking parent, applying Common Core to LAUSD students is nuts. Common Core was developed with the assumption that students had age level English skills. That’s fine if the student lives in a lilly white state but not in a state like California and definitely not in a city like Los Angeles. 
LAUSD had already destroyed education in Los Angeles way before Common Core became the standard. Is just that CC is making it worse. 
Sarah’s concern for the sad performance of LAUSD students is understandable. But it is unclear how Common Core and the subsequent testing are at fault. If Common Core is not the teaching standard, what should be? And if current testing produces invalid results, then what should the testing be?  
Sarah writes “LAUSD, however, can revamp by increasing after-school programs and mentorships that enforce the likelihood of achieving student success…” That may be helpful. But who will fund these programs? And who will volunteer to be these “mentors?” 
I mentored children years ago in a USC volunteer program. My group mentored at a jr. high near the campus.  It was terribly demoralizing. Because, perhaps, of their non-parenting parents and their poor environments, I found to my dismay that few of the children we tried to mentor could read. Worse yet, virtually all seemed to be of low intelligence. They were not ESL migrants, either. The sincere mentoring of our group could not make up for their terrible upbringing.
It is common to blame the parents in such cases. Parents? What parents? All too often the (usually unmarried) mom has escaped into crack and maybe prostitution, and dad is completely absent; that is, if mom even knows who was the biological father of her children. If raised at all, it is all too often a gang that raises such children.
So what can be done? I don’t know. I can’t even imagine a plausible remedy. I’m sorry to say, maybe nothing can be done. Maybe our culture has fallen to such a state that it can only continue to decline further.
Intervention must occur at an early age between pre-kindergaten and first grade. After that, it is usually too late. LAUSD is not in the business of educating its poorest students, but rather excels in siphoning public funds into the deep pockets of favored contractors. It is unforgivable that the DOJ and other oversight organizations have not shut down this criminal cartel.
OK, XYZ. You may be right. I confess ignorance on the subject. I found the information quoted below. Please comment if it appears accurate. If Common Core is a scam to divert state money to favorite contractors, then 1) who are the contractors in CA or other states, and 2) who are the corrupt state officials enriching them?
And I repeat my earlier questions:  If Common Core is not a sound teaching standard, what should replace it? Likewise, if Common Core testing produces invalid results, then what should the testing be?
“The Common Core is an educational standard in the US specifying what K–12 students should know in English and mathematics at the end of each grade. Common Core seeks to establish educational standards for all states and to ensure that graduating seniors in high school are ready for college, or to enter the workforce. Common Core is sponsored by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers.”
I was referring specifically to LAUSD, not common core, although companies do benefit from CCSS as well, particularly, Pearson. LAUSD is controlled by billionaire “philanthropist”, Eli Broad who is in the process of charterizing (privatizing) schools in the district. There is no current oversight or fiscal accountability for charter schools. LAUSD is ridding the district of veteran teachers through bogus below standards evaluations as well as unfounded criminal-type allegations. The money saved on teaachers’ pensions and benefit plans will be diverted to charter schools and hedge fund managers which is all the rage on Wall Street these days. John Deasy, Mr. Broad’s number one boy has publicly stated that teachers are no good to him after 5 years in the classroom. LAUSD is well on its way to replacing their administrators with graduates from Broad’s unaccredited superintendents academy. Although there is some value to the common core, many teachers lack the basic intellectual capacity and/or training to teach the standards properly. I worked for many years in a school nearby the USC campus and know this to be a fact. The smarter balanced assessments are an exercise in failure as many teachers are unable to pass the tests, so how can they possibly teach students? I do believe that poor children of color in LAUSD are being deliberately trained at a young age to experience failure so that they will lack motivation and not question the ever expanding inequality which is at the root of poverty in the US, especially in Los Angeles. An educated proletariat is very dangerous to the powers who exploit the masses. Sorry for the rant, but as always, the truth is more horrible than most can imagine.

Sneakers aren’t just for the gym anymore. Pair them with any outfit for a trendy look. Samantha Kim | Daily Trojan
Sneakers have become a hot item on and off the runway this year. What used to be only workout gear, is now taking on a new role as a high fashion trend. The sporty and cool feel they give off can add an edge to any outfit. From Nikes to New Balances and Adidas, sneakers are what everybody is wearing this year.
One reason this trend has taken off is because, first and foremost, sneakers are comfortable. They are easy to walk in, especially when running around campus in between classes, and are incredibly economical. For a reasonable price, you can look cute whenever and wherever, without breaking the bank.
The year’s hottest shoe gives off a fun and athletic vibe, but what makes the sneaker pop even more is when it is paired with feminine attire and silhouettes. Take dresses for example. They are cute and flirty, but essentially basic and predictable and often paired with flats or sandals. However, trading the boring flip-flop with something new and unexpected, like sneakers, will add a little something special to the outfit, setting you apart from the rest of the crowd.
Now, picking a shoe that is right for you can be a real dilemma. These days, brands and companies of all kinds are coming out with hot sneaker styles. However, to guarantee you get the best bang for your buck, I recommend investing in an actual athletic shoe, such as those made by Nike or Adidas. These brands have made their fortunes by providing comfort with their athletic shoe wear over the years, so your feet will definitely thank you.
As for style and color, I suggest you take your entire wardrobe into consideration. Don’t just purchase whichever sneaker catches your eye first, but instead, think about versatility and how well the shoe will go with each of your closet pieces. Another thing to consider is high top versus low top sneakers. Both have the ability to create completely different looks. Low tops, as opposed to high tops, feel more causal and relaxed. On the other hand, high tops seem a bit more formal, or at least as fancy as sneakers can get. In terms of color, again think about versatility. I recommend going for a colors like black, white or gray, not just because they are classics, but also because they go with pretty much any outfit, and will be sure to complement your wardrobe.
Sneakers can be a great addition in your closet. Don’t be afraid to take a leap of faith by purchasing your first pair today.

The New Beverly Cinema shows movies all week long for only $8. Jaycie Luo|Daily Trojan
College keeps us preoccupied with schoolwork and clubs throughout the week, but there is a whole world outside of academics. One of my favorite things to do when I have spare time is to explore different places in Los Angeles. Going to USC has its perks in that there is always something to do or see in L.A., even during school days when you only have a couple hours. Below is a detailed list of activities that can be done on the weekdays:
Movies
 Broadway was born in New York; movies were born in Hollywood. It’s no question that the film scene has a very prominent presence in Los Angeles. The myriad of theaters in the area provide a variety of different types of movies for people to watch every night. Movies are ideal for when you want something more casual on any given night. Watch the latest box office masterpiece at L.A. LIVE (located right next to Staples Center) or catch a film noir at the New Beverly Cinema (owned by the director himself, Quentin Tarantino). You can even save money by going to movies during the week. Tickets at L.A. LIVE are only $8 on Tuesdays. Tickets at the New Beverly Cinema are $8 every night. 
Art Museums
If you’re looking for a more low-key activity in the afternoon, art museums offer inspiring pieces that reflect the diversity of cultures represented in the city of Los Angeles. Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art and the Getty Center all contain sculptures, paintings and other art mediums that attract numerous visitors every day. Student tickets are $10 at LACMA and $7 at MOCA. Admission is free at the Getty Center. 
Brunch
 Don’t have class until the afternoon? Forget the dining hall, this is the perfect opportunity to dress up and organize a brunch date with your close friends. Plus, eating brunch on the weekdays easily beats waiting in long lines and struggling to find parking on the weekends. Popular brunch places in Los Angeles include Blu Jam Café, The Pantry, The Ivy, Eggslut and Jacks N Joe.
Coffee Shops
One thing that I have learned in college is how I like my coffee. As an avid coffee drinker, I’ve discovered many coffee shops in the L.A. area that serve a wide assortment of coffees, ranging from your standard cold brews to extravagant lattes and espressos. Not only are you guaranteed quality coffee, but coffee shops are also great alternatives for study areas and hangout spots. Some of my favorite coffee shops are Graffiti, Intelligentsia, Blue Bottle Coffee and G&B Coffee.
These are just a few of many places in Los Angeles that are easily accessible on the weekdays. Feel free to venture out and see what else the city has to offer!

In a city as busy as Los Angeles, there are always a variety of fun events to get your mind off of being homesick. Alina Tang | Daily Trojan
As wonderful as L.A. is with its perpetual sunshine, balmy beaches and abundance of great brunch spots, it’s still possible that you might get homesick. If you’re from out of state like I am, you’ve probably found yourself nostalgic for Mom’s cooking or something other than 75-degree weather. Whether it’s local food or a change in climate, whatever you are yearning for can be found in Los Angeles to an extent. Here are five things to do in L.A. when you’re missing home:
 1.) Find a restaurant that makes food closest to what your mama prepares (or what your favorite restaurant back home serves). Home-cooked meals are hard to replicate, but it’s possible to find something similar in a foodie city like L.A. We’re lucky to live in a metropolis with some of the tastiest and most diverse cuisines available. Whether you’re craving authentic pho or Sunday morning dim sum, ethnic enclaves like Little Saigon and Chinatown are only a few miles away.
2.) Escape to a chillier place, and play in the snow. It’s pretty difficult to justify pulling out your warm sweater and fur boots in L.A., but if you drive a little east, you can actually find some cold in the snow-topped San Gabriel Mountains or the beautiful San Bernardino National Forest. Big Bear Lake is a popular retreat location and frequented by many USC students for its ski resorts and slopes. Other mountainous regions worth visiting are Lake Arrowhead, Mt. Baldy and Mountain High.
 3.) Go hiking along the windy trails of Malibu.  Although the City of Angels is normally equated with arid desert and lack of greenery, I’ve found that you can get in touch with nature in Malibu Creek State Park. There may not be trees dotting every path, but you can certainly get great exercise and ocean views by walking along all the the steep ridges and peaks.
4.) Visit an L.A. museum. We are also very fortunate to live in a city that values art and culture. Some of the nation’s best museums can be found in L.A., including the California Science Center, the Natural History Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and my personal favorite, the Getty Center. When I want an escape from academics, I like to visit any of these museums and get lost among the different galleries and exhibitions.
 5.) Attend a social event with friends. Finding fun things to do with company can sometimes be difficult but not when you live in a vibrant city like Los Angeles. There’s always something going on, from large-scale events such as the O.C. Fair or the 626 Night Market, to more casual opportunities like night concerts and outdoor movies. Last month, my friends and I spontaneously decided to go to the Avocado Festival at Angel City Brewery because we missed eating veggies and fresh produce. It was a random outing, but it turned out to be a great way to explore the city and meet people. For more information on free events in L.A., check out Time Out Los Angeles’ guide, available here.

Bilbao is home to one of the world’s most renowned art museums, the Guggenheim. Janis Yue | Daily Trojan
A few weeks ago, one of my best friends mentioned to me that she was starting to feel like most cities are fundamentally the same: you have your bars, your shopping centers, your restaurants and so on. The real differentiating factors, she said, are the people and memories we associate with every place.
Though I definitely agree with this idea to some extent, my first week in Bilbao has driven me more and more into believing that every city possesses subtle (or not so subtle) nuances which can either mesh well (or not well at all) with your inherent being. Like the factors we seek in our romantic partners (i.e. physical attractiveness, intelligence, sense of humor, ability to belt lyrics to Kanye hits, etc.), I believe that there are also aspects of different towns that can create a sense of city compatibility.
I really click with Bilbao. And here’s why:
Aesthetics: Bilbao kind of looks like one of those fake accounts on Tinder where you’re pretty sure they just Googled the name of some obscure fashion model and used the image as their own. Yet, there’s a slight possibility that they might be a real person, and luckily for me, Bilbao is a very real place. The city boasts a unique and slightly eccentric mixture of curvy modern architecture (hello Guggenheim!), British-influenced theaters, industrial sea ports, flowery plazas, magnificently green parks and 13th century cathedrals. Bilbao had me like wow.
Appreciation of culture and art: So you’re on your first date, and what do you talk about? Well, as a huge pop culture geek and appreciator of music, art and literature, I love that Bilbao places such immense focus on developing their artistic culture. The university I’m attending sits right in between the Guggenheim, one of the most famous modern art museums in the world, and the lovely Palacio Euskalduna music center. Bilbao often has public music and art festivals where beautiful murals and photographs are displayed proudly by the city. With such a rich artistic culture, I feel like I’ll never run out of things to talk about.
Schedules: Welp, things are getting pretty serious, so we need to make sure we have enough free time for each other. As a chronic over-extender, I love that Bilbao pulls me back and reminds me to slow down and enjoy the little things in life. Unlike in Los Angeles, where I feel like I’m forced into the fast lane, I feel so much more at peace in Bilbao, where students and working people make time in the middle of their day to go home for a couple hours for lunch. Stores even shut down so people can relax. During weekends, it’s normal to eat dinner at around 10 p.m., go out and enjoy the night until 6 a.m. and then sleep in until three in the afternoon, which I dig.
Politics and social standards: Now we’re really getting to know each other. Bilbao, and I just feel like we are becoming more and more compatible each day. Bilbao is not wasteful and really cares about conserving its environment — everyone recycles, takes short showers and turns off the light when going to another room. Healthcare here is free for all citizens. People go out of their way to help one another.
So though I know that the people and memories I grow to associate with Bilbao will become so important in my heart, I can’t deny that there are special factors about Bilbao that seem to really naturally coincide with who I am.
So far, it’s a match.

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
For me, summer is always a time to detox. It’s a time to finally cook those healthy recipes and learn those impossible yoga poses bookmarked on my computer. Though being back at school is exciting, it is also incredibly difficult to commit to my cleansing summer lifestyle.
Between reconnecting with friends over Bottega Louie dinners, one too many margaritas at El Cholo and the infamous victory dogs, the gym is desperately calling my name. After long days of class, however, almost nothing can get me out of my bed and onto the treadmill. In these dire situations, I have turned to music as my motivation. Commit to making the gym a time to catch up on fall’s hottest tracks with a few classics thrown in for good measure. If you’re trying to get back into a workout routine or just  want to be hyped on life, this playlist is perfect for you.

Three USC professors spoke at the panel discussion, “Isolate or Engage: Adversarial States, U.S. Foreign Policy and Public Diplomacy” Wednesday on the United States’ history of foreign policy in the Geoffrey Cowan Forum.
Geoffrey Wiseman, Robert English and Viet Nguyen are experts in public diplomacy, the Soviet Union/Russia and Vietnam, respectively. The professors are members of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Wiseman’s book, Isolate or Engage, was released in early July around the time of the Obama Administration’s announcement regarding re-establishing diplomatic connections with Cuba, a previously “adversarial state.” Wiseman said that “adversarial” is “a less hostile term than [the usual] pariah or rogue state.”
The basis of dealing with adversarial states is in the “U.S.’s preference for isolation over engagement,” Wiseman said.
Isolate or Engage explores the U.S. cutting diplomatic ties with Cuba, China, the USSR, North Korea and Vietnam historically. Wiseman mentions in the introduction of the book that Iran, Libya, Syria and Venezuela have been added to that list.
“There are two major arguments against engagement [with adversarial states],” he said. “One is that engagement rewards bad behavior. The second is that it implies the legitimacy of the adversarial state.”
English,  an associate professor of international relations, slavic languages and literature and environmental studies, read excerpts from the chapter he wrote for Isolate or Engage, “Soviet Union/Russia: US Diplomacy with the Russian Adversary.”  The chapter addresses the historical lessons of U.S. diplomacy with Russia.
“Public diplomacy has been very important in the [U.S.’s] long history with the USSR and Russia, both in its presence and absence,” English said.
Nguyen, an associate professor of English and American studies and ethnicity, was also a contributor to Isolate or Engage, having co-authored the fourth chapter, “Vietnam: American and Vietnamese Public Diplomacy, 1945-2010.”
“From 1945, public diplomacy in Vietnam becomes very critical,” Nguyen said. “The Americans’ involvement in Vietnam happened immediately after the East Asian country declared itself free from French colonial rule. Several associations were set up to facilitate a thriving relationship between the two countries. However, the good will did not last.”
Nguyen wrote about the French influence on U.S. policy in Vietnam.
“With the formal outbreak of war between France and [Vietnam] in 1946, the United States took a position of pro-French neutrality,” Nguyen wrote in Isolate or Engage.
According to Nguyen, this began the punishment of the Vietnamese via isolation by the U.S. government.
Wiseman said that while there are disadvantages to engagement, there is also a distinct disadvantage to isolation. Isolation does not allow the U.S. governments to know what is happening inside a country they have deemed adversarial and thus isolated.
“The CIA, the FBI, rather than gathering reports from inside the isolated country itself, are instead in Washington,” Wiseman said.

The Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies is partnering with the Office of Sustainability and the Undergraduate Student Government Environmental Student Assembly to increase awareness about sustainable urban farming by constructing aquaponics systems on Catalina Island and in Parkside Gardens, set to be complete in October, in addition to the system currently in operation at the CSU/Expo Urban Mini Farm.
“Aquaponics is a versatile platform that aids in teaching concepts in biology and chemistry and into larger, broader environmental issues and economics,” said Diane Kim, director of undergraduate programs for the Wrigley Institute.
Last spring, students participated in a workshop led by David Rosenstein, cofounder of Our Foods and Evo Farm, that helped garner support for the program and educate students about aquaponics and sustainable agriculture.
“It was a three-day workshop and tutorial on how to build an aquaponics system,” said Elliott Wezerek, assistant director of ESA. “We ended up building a system for Community Services Unlimited, which delivers local food to people in the community.”
ESA has been part of this process from the beginning.
“We plan to have an event in the fall for the opening of the Parkside Garden’s aquaponics system,” Wezerek said. “ESA is coordinating with the Wrigley Institute to raise awareness about aquaponics.”
Essentially, aquaponics is a symbiosis among plants, microorganisms and fish, where the fish provide fertilizer for the plants and the plants act as natural biofilter for the fish.
“The two aquaponics systems combined should produce up to 3,700 plants and 80 pounds of fish per year,” Kim said.  “I’m not advocating that aquaponics is a panacea, but it’s one solution to urban farming that allows us to also think creatively about better ways we can be doing things.”
Senior Natalie Kra, junior Afton Montgomery and junior Christopher Carr, three current environmental studies students interning for the project, helped construct and maintain the existing aquaponics systems.
Part of the stimuli for the introduction of aquaponics and other related sustainability practices comes from a recent increase in funding for these type of projects.
ESA, USG, Graduate Student Government and USC Sustainability have partnered to create a Green Engagement Fund that has set aside $65,000 to promote student involvement in making the campus more sustainable.
According to its website, USCGEF was created in 2014 to “fund student-driven, innovative projects aimed at increasing sustainability at USC while increasing awareness in environmental stewardship.”
This led directly to the planning of the Parkside Gardens’ aquaponics system, after Jason Sanders, national program manager at Eco Safe and his wife, Kelly Sanders, faculty assistant professor of environmental engineering, secured funding after submitting their grant to Sustainability, which is partly run by ESA.
Jason Sanders previously worked with Parkside to design its compostable bags and the compost program, though he admits that his wife did most of the work behind the latest system.
“We’ve come together and developed programs for students in back of the Arts and Humanities building in Parkside where there is a large gardening system,” Kelly Sanders said. “It’s supposed to show sustainability. It is completely off the grid because it uses solar power to power the pumps.”
Thomas De Clerck, a master’s student in social entrepreneurship, is in charge of this new project.
“I am interested in food security because it is important,” De Clerck said. “It is especially critical in Southern California because this aquaponics system will use significantly less water than typical farming.”
Clerck expects the construction to be finished within the month.
“The primary objective of the system is to educate USC students and community about aquaponics,” De Clerck said.  “We hope it will spark the interest of the community.”

For the third time in four years, USC and UCLA have tied in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of national universities.
This year, the two Los Angeles schools were ranked 23rd along with Carnegie Mellon University. Both Carnegie Mellon and USC moved up two spots from last year’s polls while UCLA remained the same.
The national university rankings were very similar to last year’s for both public and private schools.
Madison Swartz, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said USC is deserving of the higher ranking.
“I think the new rankings are much closer to reflecting the level of intellect on USC’s campus than previous years,” Swartz said. “In my classes and around campus, I am continually surprised by the knowledge and insight of each USC student. Honestly, I think USC should be ranked higher.”
Phoenix Pelstring, a senior majoring in business administration, said he has been following the rankings throughout his college career.
“It is just a matter of time before USC surpasses UCLA in the rankings,” Pelstring said.
The USNWR rankings are based on a number of metrics including financial aid availability, student to faculty ratios and admission rate.
Juan Negrete, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development said he is happy USC has moved back up in the ranking.
“It’s good to see USC’s efforts recognized at the national level,” Negrete said. “I think we can only go up from here.”
But Ucla people will always say that USNWR ratings are flawed and that London Times is accurate. Ucla is ranked high on that chart whereas SC is ranked far behind…..

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted its first “Students Talk Back: A Weekly Politics and Public Policy Forum” discussion of the semester Wednesday in partnership with the USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Daily Trojan. This week’s topic was “Making College Affordable,” a bipartisan discussion on how to pay for college.
The talk was moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Yasmeen Serhan,  managing editor of the Daily Trojan.
The panel included Larry Gordon, education writer at the Los Angeles Times; Sarah Dhanaphatana, secretary of the College Republicans and deputy features editor; and Audrey Dow, vice president of external affairs for the Campaign for College Opportunity.
The discussion began by noting the $2,000 increase in USC tuition this year and how tuition hikes affected not just USC students, but all students throughout the state. Dhanaphatana attributed these increases in tuition to institutional spending, asserting that the greater spending there is on things such as new facilities and administrators, the greater the need for an increase in tuition costs.
According to Dow, whose work focuses on improving access to higher education, California needs to do more to meet the increasing demand for an educated work force. Dow said that because of the changing economy, more workers will be required in the next five years and that, by 2020, 60 percent of those workers will be required to have a post-secondary education.
“In California, we’re 1 million baccalaureate degrees short of what our economy needs to sustain itself,” Dow said. “We are not producing the number of graduates that we need to sustain the quality of life that you and I enjoy.”
Serhan then asked the panelists what universities could do to ensure that they are meeting the demands of the growing population and economy. Dow said California needs to rethink financial aid packages because they don’t do a good job of reflecting the real costs of college, given that they only estimate the costs outside of tuition, such as living expenses, books and supplies.
“Millions of students in California are working adults that have family and obligations, and financial aid has not caught up with that,” Dow said.
Dhanaphatana added that financial aid packages should be more transparent. Many students that actually qualify for financial aid and federal grants don’t take advantage of them because, at 18 years old, they do not fully understand all the costs and forms involved in the application.  Additionally, she argued that private universities need to rethink their spending, given that they are allocating millions of dollars to revamping campus facilities in order to make their institutions more attractive for high school seniors while also driving tuition costs up for their existing students.
“It’s taking away the actual focus of what is important for an undergraduate and higher education,” Dhanaphatana said. “There needs to be a shift in focus on what the universities are spending their time and money on.”
When discussing student loans and how they affect college graduates, Gordon added that a lot of people are changing their career plans to better fit their need to pay off student loans. However, he believes that newspapers are also guilty of hyping up the most extreme cases of what is happening. Gordon said that in comparison to other states, Californians are lucky that their debt is fairly manageable.
Katrina Shebanow, a senior majoring in international relations, said she witnessed the rise in USC’s tuition. Her brother graduated from USC two years before her, and she noticed that her parents were paying much more for her schooling than for her brother’s. Concerned about the rising costs, she asked Gordon what private institutions had to say in their defense. Gordon answered that the majority of the students don’t pay the sticker price for college and that it was more useful to analyze the average cost students are paying, not the total listed price.
Amira Perryman, a senior majoring in international relations, said the event opened her mind about the issue of rising tuition.
“I came into [the event] with a narrow perspective because I am a college student and affected by the issue of tuition,” she said. “It was really interesting to learn about how the issue of tuition affects others and the community.”
After the panel, Jong Su Kim, a freshman majoring in international relations, said that he enjoyed the event and wished it had been longer.
“I wish there were more advertisements for this,” he said. “I have a lot of friends that might be interested in this type of stuff, but they never know about it.”
