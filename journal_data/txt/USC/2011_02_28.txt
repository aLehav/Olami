David Kang, director of the Korean Studies Institute at USC, speaks at the Liberty of North Korea (LiNK) meeting Monday.  He described the current situation between North and South Korea as “the new Cold War” because of the tension between the two countries, but doubts North Korea will experience a revolution like those in Libya.

For the past five years, several USC students have tried to generate interest in a fraternity for gay men, yet their attempts have failed because of  a lack of publicity.
This year, however, Nick Powers, a sophomore majoring in East Asian rea studies who identifies himself as gay, and Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT student resource center, are hoping to produce more publicity to gain support for a renewed effort for a gay fraternity.
Powers hopes to create a chapter of either Delta Lambda Phi, a national social fraternity for gay, bisexual and progressive men, Sigma Phi Beta, a fraternity for gay, straight, bisexual and transgender men or Delta Lambda Psi, a co-ed fraternity that aims to connect LGBT students to the surrounding community.
Delta Lambda Phi is the largest and oldest of the gay fraternities. Its slogan is, “Founded by gay men for all men.” Though Powers said he hopes to create a chapter of Delta Lambda Phi, the steps required might pose too much of a challenge.
“The problem with [Delta Lambda Phi] is it’s the most difficult to get a chapter because the requirements are so strict,” Powers said. “You have to have at least 10 founding fathers, set up bank account, get a mailing address — it might be a little too much for us to accomplish.”
Sigma Phi Beta, whose primary goal is to teach queer men about leadership and confidence, is also a potential option but does not have as strict requirements for membership as Delta Lambda Phi. Moreover, it’s a community fraternity, meaning it’s open to those who aren’t students at USC.
“All Sigma Phi Beta sent us was a sign-up sheet for the interest group,” Powers said. “It could be one person, five people, however many.”
Powers feels as if pursuing a smaller fraternity such as Sigma Phi Beta or Delta Lambda Psi, which only has one chapter at UC Santa Cruz and has no colonization requirements, will be more productive in the progression toward creating a gay fraternity at USC.
Powers said that because interest is currently low, they do not want to limit the fraternity to only LGBT members.
“There’s only three people in our group so far, so we’re a bit inexperienced,” Powers said. “We’re not getting a lot of interest, so we don’t necessarily need a frat just for gay people.”
Powers’ goal is to choose one of the three fraternities by spring break and have the application process completed by August.
“We really want to have it soon, and we think that’s possible with Sigma Phi Beta,” Powers said. “Delta Lambda Phi just wouldn’t be possible right now.”
If Powers were to start a new fraternity at USC, he and the founding members would have to decide which fraternity council — Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council or Professional Fraternity Council ­— their chapter would classify under.
Powers said Sigma Phi Beta recommends its chapters join the Interfraternity Council at the school immediately, while Delta Lambda Phi leaves the decision up to each chapter. Delta Lambda Psi has not specified which council it prefers its chapters to join.
Patrick Lauer, IFC president, said the councils have different requirement for new chapters.
“Each council has its own expansion process,” Lauer said. “IFC has a bunch of requirements that have to do with chapter advisories, alumni support and a bunch of other factors.”
Powers and Vigil are both working to publicize the possible enactment of a new chapter in order to prevent failure this time around.
“Three years ago, California State University, Long Beach came to USC to talk to students about starting [Delta Lambda Phi]. It has always been talked about, but there has been no drive or momentum to finish it,” Vigil said. “This year, the students have been very consistent about meeting and trying to recruit. They’re putting more energy into it.”
Vigil said he will serve as a guide to Powers and the other students involved by researching the different LGBT-related fraternities and talking to chapters at other schools.
“I’m trying to recruit four to five students as a core group every other week as well as information sessions, reserving venues and trying to get the word out,” Vigil said.
Powers said the previous attempts to form a gay fraternity were unsuccessful because people were not actively communicating with each other.
“When we really started last spring, what failed was no one really knew how to organize the group and do this on our own,” Powers said. “We started to realize what’s really important now is to check up on each other every week to keep up to date with progress.”
Powers said he feels the obstacles in bringing a gay fraternity to campus are worth it.
“Personally, before college, I was turned off by the Greek community, but when I saw what it really was, I wanted to be a part of it,” Powers said.
He hopes the creation of a gay fraternity, regardless of which of the three it is, will help to break down stereotypes and build a bridge between the LGBT community and the community at large.
Hello all!
My name is Gary Brewer and I am a Brother of Sigma Phi Beta here at our Alpha Chapter at Arizona State.  I just wanted to make a small correction about or organization; we’re not community based.  We actually require all of our Brothers to be currently enrolled students of the University or College of which the Chapter is based out of.  If you have ANY questions or concerns please feel free to visit our page at sigmaphibeta.org or visit us on Facebook.  Go Trojans!
yeah, that was just a minor mistake. i told them it was the only *collegiate-based* fraternity and that DLP was the community-based one….
i’m a proud member of Delta Lambda Phi and a founding father of my chapter.  Without hesitation, although it was a long process, it made the experience so worthwhile to be part of something as great as this. Best of luck and keep the movement going!
good job  I am an alumni. I always read the daily trojan. I am stonish by this article   USc becoming so liberal.. is about time. good job!
great article!
I am gay  and I applied to USC  for 2015 class if I get accepted I will join this fraternity.. I applaud your article. way to go. even with your busy schedulle you find time to writte . that is wonderfull. thanks
great article . my brother is gay  and I think what USC is doing is giving the opportunity to those who have been alowed very little in this country we are from Russia. we have always been denied everything. great article thank you for taking your time in writting this  article.

Oscar Garcia, an undocumented student whose parents brought him from Mexico to the United States, told a crowd Monday that the Senate’s failure in December to pass the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act might mean he has to leave the school he loves, since he is not eligible for federal financial aid.
Obstacles · Felix Gutierrez, a journalism professor at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, talked about the challenges undocumented students face. - Laura Walsh | Daily Trojan 
“It would break my heart to leave the Trojans, but it’s an inevitability sometimes,” Garcia said. “Sometimes you have to do things you don’t want to do.”
The Latino Student Assembly hosted a panel Monday titled, “America: Where Dreams are Voted On” at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to inform audience members of the struggles undocumented Californian students could have escaped with the passage of the DREAM Act, which would have provided a pathway to citizenship for students whose parents are illegal immigrants.
“Being an undocumented student means a lot of things.  I really wanted to travel abroad, but I couldn’t do that — can’t do that,” said Sofia Campos, an undocumented immigrant and co-chair of  the Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success group at UCLA.
Besides being unable to afford university housing and having to commute two hours to school every day, Campos finds it nearly impossible to receive a college education.
“Our financial means are really limited,” Campos said. “We cannot receive federal aid, state aid and most scholarships are unavailable to us.”
Victor Narro, a professor of law at UCLA, said there are many misconceptions about undocumented students.
“We hear misinformation about the nature of the contribution of the immigrant,” Narro said.
Felix Gutierrez, a journalism professor at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, said employment is the key. He noted that, even if passed the DREAM Act might not have done enough.
“Unless you twin the DREAM Act with employment opportunities, it will not fufill its potential and people will not contribute to society,” Gutierrez said.
Students and professors came out of the meeting with positive feelings.
“I feel that I am really blessed and I really want to help keep making changes,” said Stephanie Barajas, a freshman majoring in theatre.
For supporters who feel similarly, Campos has helped promote the California DREAM Act, an initiative that does not address legalization but could help to provide deserving students with access to institutional aid.
“This is something we do believe is possible now,” Campos said. “The governor has come out and supported it, we just need to make sure we get the petitions to his desk and we hold him accountable to sign the bill.”
An earlier publication of this article misidentified Oscar Garcia, a sophomore from Mexico.  The Daily Trojan regrets the error and has corrected the text above to reflect the accurate information.
None of these comments actually provides a solution. They are simply ranting about illegals, grouping them all into one category with stigmas and assumptions. There are thousands of talented, highly educated undocumented students who have spent the majority of their lives in the US and are so culturally American that you could have had tons of conversations with them and never be able to distinguish them from one who is legal. They are American, educated, and extremely loyal to the US. So what are you going to do with them? Stupidly send them back to torn countries full of corruption? Send them back when this country could actually USE them? At least come up with a viable solution like the DREAM Act attempts to do.
These immigrants came to the United States after being misled into thinking that they could build a successful future and realize the “American Dream”, only to find out that it was all phony.  THEY WERE LIED TO!  The dream is fake!  The US is full of selfish, greedy pigs who would murder and oppress them, and use them to fill up their for-profit prisons by calling them “illegal”.  Americans are even mistreating the immigrant children who have lived here all their lives.  If anyone truly cared about their legal status, they would have found a way to document them and keep them working without all the schemes involving rounding them up, with money changing hands and politicians and law-enforcement getting paid to “control” immigration.  Dirty doings in the “Land of the Free”.
Why is it our Senator’s failure for unrealized dreams of students from other countries? Why is it we can not have candid discussions about Mexico’s failure to create a country that its countrymen actually want to live in and not risk their lives to cross a dangerous border to work for minimum wage here in the States? I laugh whenever I hear the term “Mexican Pride” get shouted during immigration discussions – the irony of seeing millions of Mexicans fleeing their unlivable country yet claiming pride in that 3rd world conditions.
Can we be totally honest here? What is the solution? Should the US just open up its borders and allow all of Mexico to come on in? How about we just make Mexico our 51st State? It is clear they do not know how to run a country worth living in and the most organized people there are the drug dealers. We can not cower away from the truth. We need to stop walking on eggshells around these issues if we really want future generations of Mexicans to increase the quality of life. Mexicans need to understand that it is quality, not quantity when it comes to having kids. They need to have fewer kids, but the ones they do have they need to parent better. Education needs to be emphasized more in that culture. If Mexico wants to stop being the cheap labor force for the US then they need to develop brains beyond brawn. How is it a small, village like country like South Korea 30 years ago looked like some 3rd world country and now they are some of the most tech savvy and industrialized nation in the world. what has Mexico done in the last 30 years? Have they invented new tech companies, car companies, professional services, etc? Mexico just look for US brains to come over and build auto plants for them and teach them to crank out cars for us. Mexicans need to learn how to fish, not just accept a pole, hook and line from the US.
Some of the biggest impediments to aggressively approach the problems in Mexico lies in super liberal, apologetic cowards here in the US that always has to sugar coat and point out that the US can not lecture Mexico if we are not perfect ourselves. These are the same naive people who spend all their time in their white neighborhoods in Santa Monica but are experts on the realities of the Brown Man. Please give me a break. we need to call it like we see it and claim Mexico a disaster area if we really want to quickly and effectively treat the problem. That way we do not have to have undocumented students like Oscar Garcia complain he will not get federal financial aid when there are PLENTY of documented immigrants AND CITIZENS that will also not be getting federal financial aid as well. The fact so many of our politicians are so cowardly and unable to speak candidly about this problem is why we will never be able to effectively treat the disease. Mexico has about 110 million people. Has anyone driven through East LA and Boyle heights recently? Can we honestly say making the US more like Mexico is better for anyone? If anything, Mexico needs to adopt practices more like the US. If your Mexican Pride will not allow this then fine – just stay on your side of the fence.
I am an American with mexican heritage, my natural father was an illegal immigrant, so save your ignorant “racist” blasts. Those in this country illegally are ILLEGALS, regardless of if it is their fault or not. We all pay for the mistakes of our parents. Luckily for me, my mother was an American. Regardless, back in the 60’s, the environment wasnt what it is today politically and economically. Those days we didnt have 23 million illegals to feed, cloth, treat medically, aand educate. 99% of illegals DO NOT PAY TAXES, so every single thing they do in this country is at the expense of an American. They dont even really contribute to the economic system becasue they hoard their money and send it back to mexico. It is time to stop with the crying and whining about the plight of the poor illegal, and start worrying about the plight of our own people. Illegals and their childeren dont belong here, should not be taking tax payers money to go to school or do anything, and should pack up, go home, and work to solve the problems with their own govt that caused them to leave in teh first place. enough of the bed wettitng, anti american, blame the USA first, all othre countries are better then we are, mentaility that is destroying this country by attempting to tear down capitalism and give away our quality of life. America first!
I am an undocumented American of South Asian heritage, and my family has been paying taxes for the last 23 years. You make assumptions without backing. Most undocumented individuals actually do pay taxes, contributing directly to many funds they are not allowed to take advantage of. If educated undocumented students were allowed to contribute to the US, then you would have more people willing to “feed, treat medically, and educate” the rest of the population. If anything, my university takes my tuition money to fund those who need financial aid, instead of me taking the money of others. Nobody is blaming the entire country, nor wetting the bed. It is simply a call to note that the immigration system is broken and does not allow talented de facto Americans to contribute to society, especially in such a time of need.
Help fight illegal immigration. Visit the websites for NumbersUSA and ALIPAC. We need federal E-Verify legislation.
Carlos was born here. Way to get the facts right DT…
First off, i just want to mention that the Daily Trojan is HORRIBLE at fact checking. I personally know who Carlos Hernandez is and he is NOT undocumented.  DAILY TROJAN FAIL .
I think the author of this article forgot to mention the obvious fact.  Children of parents who entered this country illegally are the VICTIMS of their parents’ wrong choices and actions.  These kids had no choice but to follow their parents on this path and now they, as young adults, have to deal with the consequences.  For all intents and purposes, children of illegal immigrants are “citizens” of the US, albeit illegal ones, but now they are handicapped by that status and have to compete with the rest of us with their hands tied behind their back.  If you think about it, it’s pretty sad and you should show some compassion for your fellow citizens.  After all, America is a land of immigrants from near and far and sometimes issues aren’t black and white.
Hats off to Tommy and Roxy Jay for their comments….I was born in a foreign country and came here LEGALLY. I went to college in California and my family paid for me- no help of any kind. If they hadn’t been able to help, I would have taken a job to pay my own way. 
USC has become an elite institution that is very popular and very hard to get into. Who is the legal US family who’s otherwise qualified student is NOT attending USC because Carlos took his or her place??  What if it were your son or daughter who missed out?  
Oh, and I’m waiting for the posts calling anyone who is against ILLEGAL immigration a racist. It’s not about race, it’s about following the law in a law abiding country.
See I do disagree with you a little here.  I don’t mind if an undocumented students gets into a great uni. They got in on merit and they more than likely add to everyone’s experience because it makes the campus more diverse.  I do not, however, think that U.S. tax dollars should pay for the undocumented student’s tuition or that these student should get automatic citizenship.  There is a legal process in place for becoming a citizen.
I do agree with you on your statement. Regardless of the situation, if you enter the country illegally, then you are breaking U.S laws and they should not be given any special circumstances. 
Like, the person below, my family immigrated legally, did the whole 9 yards and now I am a naturalized citizen. Passing the DREAM Act is a slap to my parents face who had to go through a decade+ of the naturalization process.
Bob your, parents went through the process not you. Most people are not given the chance to do it legally, that is the real problem. It is a slap on the face to the students that have excelled in school but are condemned to a life of unofficial slavery on the fields.
Clearly, you don’t understand the process of a naturalized citizen. When my parents become naturalized citizens, it doesn’t mean I automatically become one as well. True to the fact that I didn’t actually do much of the paper work, I still had to go in sign papers and get my certificate personally AND wait several years to do so. My parent’s planned ahead to start the naturalization process early so I don’t have to go through any educational ordeal.
So, it is a slap in my family’s face to pay taxes for undocumented students to receive benefits regardless of the situation. As long as it isn’t taxpayers/government money, I’m all for undocumented student’s receive aid.
On another note…
“It is a slap on the face to the students that have excelled in school but are condemned to a life of unofficial slavery on the fields.” – I’m not even going to comment on this.
Note that undocumented students are required to pay tuition. A hefty percentage of this tuition money goes directly into a fund to help students such as yourself attend school. Most undocumented families also pay taxes, contributing to services they never access to. Unlike you who has the luxury of applying to a job, undocumented students must work odd jobs under the table, commute often from far distances, and attend school. Still, they manage to speak out eloquently about their circumstances. Why should the legal student be chosen over the more qualified student? Don’t you want your school’s education standards to be more competitive and based on merit, rather than immigration status? 
I am glad that the naturalization process was easy for you and your parents. Unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone. Do you think these families are inept and haven’t actually tried to apply for legalization? They have been trying to work a broken system for decades. Also, the DREAM Act does NOT provide “automatic” citizenship for anyone. It actually makes someone be a conditional permanent resident for TEN years until they can apply for citizenship IF they have passed that time with good behavior.
I have two questions and a thought.
USC is expensive, California has amazing public schools that cost a lot less. Why would someone who is struggling financially choose an expensive private uni vs. a public one – esp. when they are comparable academically?  (In-state tuition rates apply to undocumented students who graduate from high school in CA)
Why not start the process of becoming a U.S. citizen? 
My parents immigrated here legally.  It took a while, there were working visas, then guest visas, etc. The process is a pain in the @$$, but it’s there for a reason. I support people who go through the official process of becoming U.S. citizens. I don’t think there should be exceptions (except for refugees, etc). This is my opinion about all immigrants, whether they’re coming from Mongolia, Mexico, Morocco, or Macedonia.
I agree that California has other amazing schools that cost less. Perhaps they would choose a private institution because it was their dream to attend USC. Should they sacrifice this dream due to financial difficulty? They’ve grown up in the same classrooms and playgrounds you have, yet are expected to have different dreams from you due to lack of funds and access? 
An undocumented student is not allowed to start the process of becoming a US Citizen unless he goes back to his home country and applies from there. There simply is no form, no path, no way for an undocumented student, no matter how talented or educated to even APPLY for legalization or be in any sort of process for that matter. The DREAM Act would not be introduced if such a process actually existed. We wouldn’t even be having this conversation if there was a path, no matter how long, if there was actually a process to enter.
It is a right to be in this country. Undocumented means ILLEGAL. Let us not sugar coat this. There are many CITIZENS here that do not get Financial Aid because according to the law, they are “rich enough” to afford college without any help. These “rich enough” families are the dying middle class. These “rich enough” families can not afford to send their children to college because they are too busy sending other people’s children to college via taxes. These “rich enough” families are struggling with bills and high priced necessities.  Why should tax payers pay for ILLEGAL immigrants to get an education, when we can’t even help law abiding CITIZENS?! America is facing a financial crisis with a HUGE debt. We need to lower this debt, and by giving out more handouts to people who broke the law by coming here illegally is only going to get us into a deeper hole. 
Not only do they want government money for school, but they also are pushing for employment? How nervy. Employment is a PRIVILEGE these days. Many employers are hiring illegals for cheap labor. This means taking jobs from Americans. This means taking jobs from high school students and college students. It is hard to sympathize on this issue. EVERYONE has a dream. To expect people to just HAND IT TO YOU is extremely asinine. Moreover, there WAS and IS a right and legal way of coming to this country. The parents of these students failed to abide by our laws and did not WAIT and PAY like the rest. It seems only fair that they pay now as they are lucky enough to even be here still… illegally.
Undocumented students are not eligible for state (Cal Grant) and federal (FAFSA).
I know, but that is what they are pushing for with the Dream act bill.
Nope your wrong, they want the same chance as all other students. Just so you know, a big chunk of the tuition money on UC’s goes into a pool used for financial aid purposes. These student have zero access to the money they contribute. This law would give them access to what they pay for.

The USC-Stanford water polo rivalry continued Sunday evening with another rematch of last year’s NCAA championship game. This time, however, it was a championship game at the UC Irvine Invitational.
The Women of Troy went head-to-head against the Cardinal once again, hoping to exact revenge for their Stanford Invitational loss earlier this season — but they again suffered defeat, this time by a 9-6 margin.
“I feel like everyone was a bit more hesitant that just being aggressive and seeing the open shot,” said senior driver Joelle Bekhazi. “A few people were just rushing shots. We weren’t making the right decisions about shooting the ball, which didn’t really give us a big chance to succeed.”
The invitational started off well for USC (9-2, 1-0), with a victory Saturday morning against UC San Diego, 14-5. The Women of Troy used a balanced attack, as 10 different players scored goals in the early-morning meeting.
Junior two-meter Nadia Dan led the way with a hat trick. Sophomore drivers Dominique Sardo and Constance Hiller followed close behind with two goals each.
With the win, USC advanced to play San Diego State, who the Women of Troy soundly beat 11-3. A plethora of players scored during this game as well, with sophomore driver Chelsea Silvers leading the way this time with a hat trick.
Sunday morning brought about a game against crosstown rival UCLA. The Women of Troy stormed out of the gates, grabbing an 8-4 lead at  the half.
The Bruins mounted a rally, however, but came up just short as USC was able to hold them off to win 9-8. The win secured themselves a spot in the Invitational Championship game.
“We played up and down,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “We had some really good moments and some that were not so great. We had some really good offensive goals and offensive executions, but in defense we made some mistakes.”
In previous years, USC and Stanford have had heated matches. The first tournament championship game this year, however, went in favor of the Cardinal, and this match was no different.
Unlike the earlier games in Irvine, the Women of Troy were unable to score many goals with an array of players. Rather, they were confined this game to only four scorers, with Bekhazi and senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger leading the way with two goals apiece.
“You need more people to be involved in offense,” Vavic said. “We just missed a lot of shots, which were a lot of six-on-five opportunities. We were 4-for-12 on power plays. We drew two ejections in one session and didn’t score a goal. That’s not a good percentage.”
USC’s next match is a clash against California on Saturday, March 5, at McDonalds Swim Stadium.
“We’re going to work a bit on everything this week,” Vavic said. “This group of girls has to learn how to be focused the whole game and not just for one half.”

If you’re into lewd, rude and obnoxious comedic films with some  heartfelt scenes, Hall Pass is definitely for you.
Peter and Bobby Farrelly have created another laugh-out-loud comedy. Although not quite as hilarious as their previous films, such as There’s Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber and The Heartbreak Kid, Hall Pass has plenty of memorable scenes and funny moments.
Wise guys · Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis play the role of two guys who get a hall pass from marriage but discover their real needs. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. 
The film’s concept is simple. Two 40-something-year-old guys (Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis) with wandering eyes and a longing for a variety of women are given “hall passes” by their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate, respectively) These passes give them one week off from marriage to do whatever they want, whenever they want and with whomever they want.
To set up seven wild days away from marriage, the story establishes the ordinary, mundane family life of Rick (Wilson) and Fred (Sudeikis). Both clearly yearn for younger, livelier women. Whenever an attractive woman walks by, Rick or Fred shamelessly stares at her cleavage, even with their wives present.
Both wives give their husbands the pass thinking that since some married men desire other women only because it is forbidden, giving their husbands a few days off from marriage will soften the desire to cheat.
Rick’s week-long tests are where the great comedy takes place. Rick is challenged when Leigh, a coffee shop girl played by Nicky Whelan, aggressively tempts him to use his hall pass by dropping her top. Instead of taking the opportunity, however, Rick remembers his deep love for his wife.
The supporting cast members bring additional perspective and humor into the story. J.B. Smoove, Larry Joe Campbell and Stephan Merchant play the clueless sidekicks giving foolish advice and cheering Rick and Fred toward their goals, yet hindering them along the way. At one point, Gary (Merchant) offers everyone marijuana brownies and later finds out that anything more than a quarter piece is too much.
The Farrelly Brothers do a good job of writing comically, even planting a Kathy Griffin joke five minutes into the movie that doesn’t pay off until the end of the film.
The film’s accompanying screenwriters, Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett clearly love channeling the teenage boys within them. After all, they created a story about two men who get a week off from marriage.
The screenwriting team also knows how to take jokes a step further than expected. Once you think a gag is about to end, there’s another payoff that extends the joke or a humorous twist to a sincere situation. In one noteworthy scene, Rick tells Maggie that, “You were my first, my last and everything in between,” to which she replies, “Is that why you were crying?”
The Farrelly Brothers mix raunchy comedy with heartfelt scenes. At its emotional core, this story is about a married man, Rick, who not only wants to feel young again, but also wants to be desired by a woman — namely, his wife. Rick eventually discovers what he actually needs is to love his wife and be loved in return.
The Farrelly Brothers create a film that provides many laughs, and they do so in a simple manner.

Oregon-based indie electro-pop group STRFKR is slated to release its new album Reptilians in March, after signing with its new record label, Polyvinyl, last August.
Haven’t heard of STRFKR? The group, made up of Shawn Glassford, Ryan Biornstad, Keil Corcoran and front-man Josh Hodges, is known for its stage dives, cross dressing and Target commercial featuring “Rawnald Gregory Erickson the Second.” Fans of Pinback, MGMT and Crystal Castles will rejoice in the hazy vocals, ethereal echoing and techno-centric beats of STRFKR.
STRFKR’s attention-grabbing name (the group was formerly known as PYRAMID, and later Pyramiddd) and constellation of dance-friendly music has garnered the band fame among the indie-pop community and on the Internet.
The group’s music is unlike anything on the radio. It is not the bubble gum and sweet candy songwriting of love and the pursuit of a significant other, but instead a contemplation of one’s own life. Talk of death can be dreary, but STRFKR attacks the sticky issue with humor.
Reptilians begins with “Born,” a slew of high-pitched melodies and up-beat drumming that is both haunting and hypnotizing. “Julius” has a pulsing tempo and ominous vocals that leave your head swaying to the tunes of this refreshing group.
The album’s focus seems to be on the demise of the world as we know it, with song titles like “Bury Us Alive” and “Death as a Fetish.” But instead of running to church to repent on past sins, STRFKR’s dreamy-pop music will have you hitting the dance floor.
On the “Mystery Cloud,” STRFKR produces thoughtful words after a cheery ballad with Hodges singing Everybody should do in their lifetime sometime, two things / One is to consider death / To observe scowls and skeletons and to wonder what it would be like to go to sleep and never wake up / Never.
The listener, shocked by the blunt probing of death, is comforted by Hodges’ mature perspective.
STRFKR masterfully grabs you with its groovy vibes, while pulling you in with its philosophical examination of the afterlife.
The authoritative phrases of “Mystery Cloud” hang on the chords of the human heart where the only way to bring meaning to one’s own life is by recognizing there is, in fact, an end to it. Everyone is going six-feet under so we might as well celebrate what we have, wherever we are and preferably with the beats of STRFKR.
Following “Bury Us Alive,” “Death as a Fetish” and “Mystery Cloud” both conjure a relaxed vibe by mixing electric guitar and thumping drums. The group tones it down in “Mona Vegas,” a softer ballad that lets the listener drift off to sleep.
The album continues with “Millions,” a song filled with generous dance-hopping beats and a breakdown of lightly-handled tambourines.
STRFKR has the last hurrah in the club-thumping song “Quality Time,” where the band contemplates many emotions set to  a multi-layered track and the rise and fall of the group’s crescendo.
Once you listen, you’ll be hooked.
If you are left wanting more, STRFKR has announced a full U.S. tour starting in San Francisco and hitting West Hollywood at the Troubadour Mar. 11.
I said both things.
the spoken word section of “mystery cloud” is done in the same voice and pertains to the same topic as “i am s/he…” by giraffes?giraffes!
who said the original speech?

Hollywood is having a midlife crisis.
Or so it would seem from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ lame attempt at embracing a young audience at Sunday’s Academy Awards. 
From their opening bit, unlikely co-hosts Anne Hathaway and James Franco poked fun at the obvious, and totally misguided, reason they were chosen for the job.
Franco complimented Hathaway on looking hip, to which she responded, “You look very appealing to a younger demographic as well.”
There’s no doubt these two are pleasant to look at for people of all ages, but that doesn’t make them right for the role of host.
Perhaps actively catering to the demographic he was meant to attract, Franco acted as though he was on some kind of narcotic for most of the night. With drooping eyelids and a dreamy smile, most of his one-liners fell awkwardly flat.
Hathaway, on the other hand, enacted her youthfulness with incessant giggling at everything Franco did, and school-girlish over-excitement when introducing big-name stars like Steven Spielberg.
When she flubbed an introduction, Hathaway referenced the drinking games young viewers were presumably playing at home.
The two young stars might have embodied some sort of youthfulness, but it wasn’t an especially appealing one.
Further efforts at being hip included Justin Timberlake’s onstage reference to the ever-increasing breadth of smartphone apps, and a video in which scenes from recent movies, such as Harry Potter and Twilight, were auto-tuned into ridiculous techno-pop songs.
There were some chuckle-worthy moments throughout the night, but nothing that signaled a genuine generational shift, and really, nothing all that memorable.
The show was made up of inane grasps at what the producers believed to be hip humor.
Funnily enough, one of the stronger moments of the night came when eight-time Oscar host Billy Crystal introduced a retrospective video on Bob Hope, an 18-time host.
With one simple joke about the Oscars running over their scheduled time, Crystal brought a comfortingly familiar style of humor back to Oscar night.
Maybe the Academy should try to age gracefully instead of splurging on the flashy, but useless, convertible that was Franco and Hathaway.
The tension between a new generation of Hollywood and the old guard (exactly where the distinction lies between the two of them is entirely debatable) was significantly more evident in the awards themselves.
Although the producers of the Academy Award broadcast might have wanted hot young things onstage to attract viewers, the Academy voters were not as concerned.
The King’s Speech’s sweep of four major categories — Best Picture, Director, Actor and Original Screenplay — reveals the Academy’s continuing taste for traditional Oscar bait.
As demonstrated by Dame Helen Mirren and Cate Blanchett, who played two different Queen Elizabeths, the Academy has a taste for British monarchs, and Colin Firth, who portrays the stammering King George VI, was widely accepted as having a lock on the Best Actor award.
But the race between The King’s Speech and The Social Network was much closer for the Best Picture and Director categories.
The Social Network, hailed as the film that defines our generation, was the Academy’s chance to prove that it is in touch with today’s youth.
Often referred to simply as “the Facebook movie,” the film captured something of the technology-induced alienation of millions of tweeters. It even represented the linguistic shift occurring in our society, as words like “friend” and “like” now have new meanings.
Although this sounds overstated, the film was able to tell a story that belongs uniquely to a younger generation. And predictably, the Academy voters instead chose the safe, broadly inspirational period piece that tells a story belonging to an era, a country and a class of people beyond a younger audience’s reach.
With The King’s Speech dominating the second half of award season, its Best Picture win did not come as a surprise. The Weinstein movie machine cranks out Oscar wins at a formidable pace, and the film’s sweep of the various Guild awards had a lot to do with pitch-perfect marketing.
But many critics believed The Social Network’s David Fincher would still take home the Best Director award for his uncanny ability to make nerdy guys sitting at computers so exhilarating.
Although Fincher is 10 years older than The King’s Speech director Tom Hooper, he has been considered a definitive artistic voice in our generation since the cult classic Fight Club in 1999.
Fincher’s loss to Hooper, a British director little-known in the States, seems to display the Academy’s blind insistence on sticking to its traditional ways.
Franco, Hathaway and a thoroughly unmemorable Oscar broadcast might not be the solution to Hollywood’s midlife crisis. The Academy could stand to broaden its horizons a bit. Then, maybe the young and the old can all be “friends.”

I couldn’t stop laughing at Randy Newman’s speech. I found him to be sincere and hilarious.
I loved Anne Hathaway last night, she hosted the whole thing by herself, it was like James wasn’t even there. What was that about? Other than that Sandra Bullock was the funniest (can she host next year?) along with Jude Law, Robert Downey Jr, Russell Brand and Helen Mirren. Colin Firth was a darling too and Natalie is just too adorable.

One of the strangest experiences a person can have is tasting something unexpected. Putting a dollop of something in your mouth that, judging by color and smell, is berry ice cream, is not usually ominous. But try having strawberry ice cream with anise spice and you will find yourself experiencing utter confusion.

Surprises of this nature abound at Playa, and that’s a good thing. The restaurant, which opened Feb. 11 on Beverly Blvd., is the creation of chef John Rivera Sedlar, famous in Los Angeles for the much-touted Rivera restaurant.
Whereas Rivera’s menu takes diners through a tour of Latin America, with each of its dinner menus representing a different country, Playa takes a more straightforward approach by offering hot and cold appetizers plus entrees and desserts.
The tapas-style portions are minute. Even if you’re not starving, sharing any of the entrees with one or two other people leaves about four bites per person. And at $6 to  $12 a pop, Playa isn’t the cheapest dinner around.
Sedlar knew, however, his guests would be paying for an adventure and not just food.
Once you get to Playa (good luck finding parking nearby), decoding the notebook-like menu takes effort, even for a self-proclaimed foodie. Thankfully, the staff is incredibly knowledgeable about both the food and the cocktails, and is willing to make suggestions.
Our waitress was even polite enough to be honest and steer our table away from some of the less noteworthy items on the menu.
Our first appetizer was a black bean soup garnished with compressed apple dots. The black bean puree is poured dramatically at your table into a stylish square bowl, which proves an awkward choice of dish for the viscous liquid.
The incredibly smooth soup tastes of smoky chipotle and bacon. Crisp, sweet apples, compressed into tiny circles, are a surprising but delicious complement to the soup that leaves you wishing for more little nuggets of sweetness in the bowl.
Other appetizers include a variety of maize cakes — fresh, thick corn tortillas, hand-pressed near the bar — finished off with toppings like pork belly, cauliflower and flower petals.
The wild mushroom maize cake with arugula and an odd black garlic and olive powder is completely overwhelmed by a strong, creamy cheese, undermining the perfect mushrooms on top.
Though one might hope  Sedlar would simplify a few of his dishes like this maize cake or the utterly overwhelming Flora y Terra dessert, it is exactly this complexity that defines Playa, even if the various flavor combinations don’t always work.
The few entrée selections Playa offers are hardly larger than the appetizers, but still provide heartier, meat-centric offerings.
The beautiful plates, which Sedlar hand-selected and plans to interchange sporadically, feature photos and paintings.  
Each presentation is interesting and personal to the chef, adding to the adventurous spirit of eating at Playa.
Like many items at Playa, the desserts are uniquely challenging.
The Flora y Terra is, in layman’s terms, strawberry chips like the ones in Special K cereal, pink-colored, black licorice flavored ice cream and a crumbled vanilla cupcake surrounded by fresh strawberries and pomegranate with blood orange syrup. If this sounds like too much, especially if you don’t read the menu correctly and have a distinct distaste for anise flavor (guilty), you’re right.
The Luna Mezcal dessert is far more successful. The unreal mescal tequila ice cream is dream-worthy, and the blackberry-basil ice cream is shockingly herby and earthy for a dessert.
Together, the ice creams, which top a very ordinary chocolate cake, elevate the dish in a savory and surprising way.
Filling up on specialty cocktails might not be the worst route to go, either.
Specialty drinks like The Grail, a cold, spiked cider, are expertly prepared. The ice cubes are actually perfectly dimensioned cubes, one of the many indications of the care and consideration put into every cocktail.
Although the bar is hardly big enough to hang out at, the drinks are noteworthy enough to warrant a return to Playa in and of themselves.
Sedlar might not have created another Rivera, but Playa is an interesting dining experience that will surely leave patrons talking.
Just don’t go if you’re a picky eater or particularly hungry.

Way back before the season started, Nikola Vucevic spoke with glee at Pac-10 media day about the prospect of playing in the NCAA tournament.
The season before, the USC basketball program, in an act of righteous self-flagellation, sanctioned itself from postseason play because it knew the NCAA hammer was going to come down at some point.
Although it was unfortunate for the 2009-10 team, it was the right move for the program because it meant the Trojans would be eligible this season.
“I was really happy about it because now we have a chance to play for something,” Vucevic said that day. “Last year they suspended us, and we played for really nothing.”
But just two weeks ago, it seemed the Trojans were again going to be shut out of the NCAA tournament not because of self-imposed sanctions, but because of self-imposed stupidity.
USC lost an ugly game to Oregon, its fourth loss in six games. At that point, the only way the Trojans would be dancing in March would be through an improbable sweep of the Pac-10 tournament and the automatic bid that comes with it.
Four games and four wins later, the Trojans have vaulted themselves back into the conversation.
If coach Kevin O’Neill’s boys can take care of the Washington schools this weekend, this team deserves a tournament bid.
In ESPN language, the Trojans are a bubble team. They are 6-6 against the RPI top-100 schools, 4-4 against top-50 and 3-1 vs. AP top 25 schools. With a 17-12 record, the Trojans could conceivably reach 20 wins by sweeping the Washington schools and getting one win in the Pac-10 tournament.
Undoubtedly, USC has a few blemishes on its resumé, some more unsettling than Lady Gaga’s meat dress. The Trojans lost to Rider, a school few knew existed, and Bradley, which could either be an academic institution or just some dude you had a class with. That kind of confusion is never a good sign. Other bad losses include TCU and Oregon State.
Then, of course, there are the huge wins over Texas, UCLA, Arizona and at Tennessee. And don’t forget, the Trojans almost knocked off Kansas on the road. When viewed in this light, USC looks like a perfectly qualified choice.
Do the bad losses outweigh the big wins? That’s really a toss up. But the Trojans do seem to be peaking. If they can end their season hot, that should be enough to put them over fellow bubble teams. 
But throw the numbers out the window for a moment. Let’s pretend resilience was factored into the RPI ratings. Judged by this standard, the Trojans would be shoo-ins.
Amid all the bad losses and ugly basketball displayed this season, one thing we have never seen is surrender. Adversity has been piled onto USC’s basketball program over and over again, yet “quit” is not a word that comes to mind when the team plays.
O’Neill’s coaching is a big reason for this, but the players’ ability to stay the course is just as important. They were punished for transgressions they had no part in, but they didn’t complain. They have been working with a seven-man rotation ever since Bryce Jones abruptly transferred, but they don’t ask for pardon. Neither fatigue nor lack of depth is ever used as an excuse, even though they are the two biggest culprits for the Trojans’ inconsistency this season.
That’s why ending the regular season with a string of victories is the strongest way to send the message that USC has kicked its worst habit.
Even if the Trojans lose to Washington and beat Washington State, a case could still be made if they can pull off a few victories in the Pac-10 tournament. If they beat both, then it would be nothing short of robbery if the Trojans are left out.
Something tells me the Trojans are going to find a way to get in. After being forced to sit last season out, they can’t let the chance slip away voluntarily this year.
If the Trojans do their part, no one deserves to be dancing more.

Great article and analysis.  Beating UW. U Dub,  will be tough.  If we pull off sweep, we are hot goin into Pac-10 Tourney, and have nice RPI wins….
This team has heart.  Support them.  Good things are bleeding Cardinal&Gold……and beginning to Dance with a touch of Trojan “Madness.”

Following resounding victories over No. 10 Arizona and Arizona State, USC junior forward Nikola Vucevic was named Pac-10 men’s basketball Player of the Week for the week of Feb. 21-27.
Inside presence · Junior Nikola Vucevic has been a double-double machine for the USC men’s basketball team the entire season, averaging 17.5 points and 10.3 rebounds. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Vucevic’s strong play as of late has powered the Trojans to four straight wins, increasing their chances of earning an NCAA tournament at-large bid.
In the Trojans’ 65-57 upset win over No. 10 Arizona, which snapped the Wildcats’ eight-game winning streak, Vucevic had a game-high of 25 points and 12 rebounds.
But it was his 17-point contribution in the second half that helped the Trojans bounce back from a late four-point deficit to win the game.
In the Trojans’ 62-46 win over Arizona State on Saturday, Vucevic tallied 20 points and 10 rebounds, finishing the week with per game averages of 22 points and 11 rebounds.
He notched his 18th double-double of the season, and sixth straight overall.
Vucevic’s father, Borislav, was in attendance for both games at the Galen Center — it was the first time he was able to watch his son play in person while at USC.
This is Vucevic’s first career Pac-10 Player of the Week honor and the 33rd Trojan basketball player to receive the award for USC all-time.
It is the second time this season a Trojan has won Pac-10 Player of the Week, as junior guard Jio Fontan earned the award for the week of Dec. 20-26.
Vucevic and the Trojans will finish off their season on the road, going head-to-head with Washington State on Thursday and Washington on Saturday.

The USC baseball team will continue its seven-game road trip today as the Trojans travel south to Blair Field in Long Beach, Calif.
The Trojans (3-4) will send junior Ben Mount to the mound to face off with Long Beach State at 6:30 p.m. Both teams are trying to bounce back after tough weekends against top-25 opponents.
Snapping the streak · The Trojans, who are in the middle of a seven-game road trip, will send junior Ben Mount to the mound Tuesday in hopes of putting an end to their three-game losing streak.  -  Daily Trojan file photo
Long Beach State (2-5) swiped its first game against No. 17 Arizona thanks to a strong pitching performance by Andrew Gagnon this weekend, but Arizona got retribution in the final two games of the series with dominant 9-1 and 7-1 victories.
USC, meanwhile, was swept by then-No. 21 Rice, despite having opportunities late in all three games. The Trojans’ bullpen gave up some runs and the offense couldn’t get the timely hitting needed, leaving 32 runners on base in the series.
Although disappointed about losing all three games, interim coach Frank Cruz said he is excited about the way the team has battled early in the season.
“They’re trying like hell,” Cruz said. “It’s incredible. They’re relentless. When the other team scores some runs, we respond. These guys are like prizefighters right now. They are responding. Now, we just have to get that knockout punch.”
USC and Long Beach State are in similar situations with a pair of new coaches trying to turn around once proud and storied programs that have fallen off in recent years.
The Dirtbags enjoyed a 20-year stretch under coaches Dave Snow and Mike Weathers that included 17 trips to the NCAA tournament and four College World Series appearances.
From 1989 to 2008, they had 20 consecutive winning seasons and finished with a .633 winning percentage over the duration of the period.
The last two years, Long Beach State has finished with a losing record. The Dirtbags even finished last in the Big West Conference last year for the first time since before Snow tenure’s as coach.
That led to the promotion of Troy Buckley from associate head coach working with the pitchers and catchers to head coach.
USC saw a similar move as Cruz was promoted from volunteer assistant head coach to interim head coach after the firing of Chad Kreuter.
Under Kreuter’s watch, the Trojans had slipped from one of the most prestigious programs in the nation, with their record 12 national championships, to a lower-tier Pac-10 program, unable to finish with a winning record, going four consecutive seasons without a winning record for the first time in school history.
Both programs are trying to make a similar resurgence, but this year’s squads are trying to win in different ways.
Long Beach State relies on a deep pitching staff. Fifteen pitchers have taken the mound for a staff that boasts a 3.48 ERA this season. But the Dirtbags are only hitting .248 as a team.
USC, on the other hand, has been hitting well with a .303 batting average and an on base percentage above .400.
“We’re really trying to work on [hitting] up the middle and the other way,” Cruz said.
The team, however, has struggled to get the timely hits needed to sway the contest in the late innings. They have been outscored 13-8 in the final three innings so far this season.
“The last three innings have not been kind to us in all four losses,” Cruz said. “That’s where we’ve lost the game.”
Over the weekend, Rice took the lead in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings against USC’s bullpen, where Cruz said he is still working on defining the exact roles for each pitcher.
He also believes confidence is key for the Trojans to succeed late in ball games.
“It’s about us going out and believing that we are going to close the game as opposed to thinking they might not close the game,” Cruz said. “I think that’s part of the mentality they’ve had [in the past].”

Sunday’s 83rd Academy Awards weren’t overtly green. Natalie Portman wore an eco-friendly dress to a pre-party and the red carpet was in fact made of recycled water bottles, as promised.
Pledges of sustainability were kept, but obviously environmentalism wasn’t in the spotlight.
That could be different next year.

According to a recent Los Angeles Times article, the United Nations is making a conscious effort to weave itself into the fabric of Hollywood.
“Usually I speak to prime ministers and presidents, but that has its limits,” U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the Times. “Movie producers, directors, actors — they have global reach.” 
Ki-moon, who is beginning to push for a film about the reality of global warming, met with actors and representatives from various U.N. panels to discuss upping the visibility of climate change in Hollywood.
So, it’s possible that in the coming years, we’ll be seeing an increase in celebrities not just promoting sustainability or clean energy, but actually starring in movies about it.
The U.N. seems to feel it can no longer effectively reach its constituents, at least on issues like climate change, where it’s harder to pinpoint threats that are tangible and immediate.
The question now is whether or not Hollywood is the right partner for the organization.
It might be. The push into Hollywood should not come across as arbitrarily turning to pop culture to drive home a serious issue; rather, it is an example of the U.N. strategically using its available resources. Earth, March of the Penguins and An Inconvenient Truth all rank among the top 10 highest-grossing documentaries in the history of American cinema, with other similarly-themed projects such as Oceans, Wall-E and Avatar being favorably received as well — clearly the environment already has a place in Hollywood. Why not expand that?
Film isn’t the only medium the U.N. is targeting. According to the Times, the organization is also looking to pursue television series.
In short, the U.N. has recognized the power of actors and social media to effect change.
But just because environmentalism already has its foot in Hollywood’s door doesn’t mean the U.N. doesn’t have its work cut out for it.
As with the Oscars, people don’t turn to Hollywood to hear about recycling and the threat of global warming — people flocked to Avatar because of its visuals, not its plot line.
Don Cheadle, who spoke at Ki-moon’s forum, summed it up best by saying, “most people on Friday night are not going out to see something that tastes like medicine. They want entertainment.”
The jury’s still out on whether or not a movie can educate about the environment and still be entertaining.
Despite the success of some previous films about sustainability and climate change, many others simply left the audience laughing about how cheesy they were. Ki-moon’s assurance to the U.N. and the film industry that “together we can have a blockbuster impact on the world” sadly threatens to follow in the same vein.
Ultimately, this move could prove to have little or no return for the U.N., in which case it would simply be left looking ineffective and out of touch.
We now get to wait and see if the U.N. can take what it perceives to be the environment’s most pressing storylines and inject them into mainstream Hollywood to produce something palatable.
We can only hope that the results are as educational as An Inconvenient Truth and at least as entertaining as Wall-E.

With a longtime dictator gone from Egypt, another headed in the same direction in Libya and mass protests in Yemen, Bahrain and Algeria, among others, it’s about time to figure out what exactly U.S. policy is when it comes to domestic uprisings in the Middle East.
So far, our foreign policy has been nothing short of pure realpolitik — politics that focus on practical factors rather than ethical or ideological ones.
The Obama administration should abandon its overly pragmatic approach to foreign policy and start responding as a leader of the free world.
Recently, we have been waiting until the last moment to take a definitive position. Only once it was clear the protests in Egypt could not be quelled did the United States call for a peaceful transition, and only once it was clear the protesters would accept nothing short of former President Hosni Mubarak’s resignation did the United States finally turn its back on him.
The government’s stance on the protests in the Middle East has also been inconsistent.
For example, as the protests in Tahrir grew stronger,  the Obama administration exerted increased pressure on Mubarak to answer to his citizens.
But when similar protests gathered steam in Iran shortly thereafter, the Obama administration issued an underwhelming condemnation, despite the fact that the brutality with which the Iranian security forces operated made their Egyptian counterparts look like a group of unwieldy boy scouts.
So why has United States’ response varied so widely? Again, realpolitik. Mubarak was bound to fall, so although he had been a committed ally of the United States for 30 years, we jumped on the bandwagon with the protesters.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on the other hand, appeared poised to crush the Iranian protesters at any cost, and yet, although his regime is nothing short of state-sponsored terror diametrically opposed to nearly every U.S. interest in the region, we held back our criticism.
Likewise, everything thus far indicates that Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi would rather murder thousands of his own people than give up power, but, given Libya’s position as a key player in the oil market, the United States has stayed relatively mum.
This is pragmatism and realpolitik at its best. It is not, however, policy. This discrepancy sheds light on a larger issue, one that fundamentally affects how we view the Middle East. The reason why we have no set policy is because we never expected this.
Conventional wisdom has always assumed the transition to democracy in the Arab world would occur through gradual concessions and persistent international support. For example, Lebanon was formerly on the path to democratization after years of support from the United States and international community, which helped build civil society and the institutions necessary for democracy.
The idea that the citizens themselves, with little or no support, could overthrow a dictator and establish something other than another repressive regime was unfathomable.
U.S. policy with respect to the turmoil in the Middle East is essentially straight-jacketed, caught between what we espouse as our highest values, in freedom and democracy,  on one side and the need to stand by our regional allies and assure our national interests on the other.
Justin Davidoff is a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Here are some reasons Islam and democracy are incompatible.
• Inimical to ‘social freedoms’, demanding that all people obey their 7th century moral codes without question or criticism, under penalty of death.
• Inimical to ‘man made’ laws, claiming that their laws are given to them by God/Allah and all must obey them, in submission, under penalty of death.
• Inimical to the ‘social contract’ that is democratic constitutional government, for the people and by the people, in pursuit of ‘life, liberty, and happiness’, as these are ‘man made’ ideas, and to submit to them over Allah’s laws is apostasy, punishable by death.
• Inimical to the ‘rights of individuals’ to pursue their own ideals and beliefs, freedom of worship, freedom of inquiry of truth, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of artistic expression, freedom of loving other human beings, freedom of choice, freedom of pursuing one’s life with reciprocal respect for others regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity, or sex, as these are our ‘inalienable’ rights; to pursue these may be punishable by death.
• Inimical to ‘democratic freedoms’ as protected by (man made) constitutional laws agreed upon by social contract to protect the rights of individuals, but in favor of ‘dictatorship’ politics supported by the Ulama with the ultimate goal of imposing a universal Caliphate dictating all society according to (Allah/Mohammad’s) Sharia, where submissive obedience is rigorously mandatory, under penalty of death.
• Inimical to intellectual ‘secularism’ in all its forms, in education, in philosophical inquiry and discourse, in the sciences, in religious studies, in history studies, in sociological studies, in anthropological studies, in archeology studies, if these are not in concordance with the ‘religious’ teachings of the Koran, except as studies of ‘infidel’ societies to be subdued, conquered for conversion, to pay the jizyah, or be put to death.
• Inimical to social ‘equality’ of all human beings, especially of the female sex, women kept in oppression as chattel for procreation and sexual gratification of males; as submissively obedient house slaves in violation of the sanctity of their personal humanity, unfree to seek life as they desire but must live in fear of their male masters who will punish them if they disobey, for violating their ‘honor’, with death.
What sane rational person would not think these are tyrannical oppressions of the human soul in violation of our individual sanctity as free human beings? Are these the hallmarks of a ‘world religion’ or are they the sad testaments of a ‘world cult’ of an Arabian pagan ideology? Any sane rational person would not hesitate to condemn this ideology inimical to all our modern 21st century civilization, and seriously constrict their ‘religio-cult’ malevolent activities in open society, and clean house. Is that bigotry? In a sane, morally upright world Islam would not be openly tolerated, but its evil, inimical ideology put down. … But I’ve let my imagination run free…
Justin,
I do not mean to be harsh but when will people, like you, realize that democracy and Islam are incompatible?
*************
The only way for the people of the Middle East (all of Islam for that matter) to experience true democracy is to free themselves from the shackles of Islam.
Islam and democracy are incompatible and anyone who says Indonesia is an example they are simply showing just how dire Islamic democracies are.
Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Oman, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kirgizstan, etc…
Name one country from this or any list of Islamic dominated countries where one can freely criticize Islam, convert from Islam, proselytize for any other religion, draw pictures of Mohammed, criticize Saudi Arabia, openly practice homosexuality or Judaism, be a free woman with all this implies.
So please don’t blame Egypt’s problems on America. I would bet money that if America could foster true democracy in any Muslim country it would, just as it fostered freedoms and democracy in Germany and Japan after WWII.
Quit blaming their problems on anyone but them and their backwards-looking religion.
Finally, let me say, Mohammed was Islam’s first political leader. He refused to acknowledge a separation of mosque and state as Jesus did (Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s…). Mohammed was a theocratic despot who killed, raped, enslaved and pillaged his way to power and wealth.
This is who Muslims look to for direction, no? Not to America, but to Mohammed and therein lies the tale of the tape.
Justin writes, “For example, Lebanon was formerly on the path to democratization after years of support from the United States and international community, which helped build civil society and the institutions necessary for democracy.”
Well that policy didn’t work that well for now Hezbollah has appointed one of their stooge Islamists as Prime Minister of Lebanon

Former USC tight end Jordan Cameron might be turning heads at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis, but other Trojans are getting some attention of their own.
Center Kristofer O’Dowd, who battled various injuries during his final two seasons at USC, displayed more athleticism during drills than many predicted. The senior ranked up some strong statistics among the offensive linemen, tying for ninth in the broad jump (8-9), tying for seventh in the 20-yard shuffle (4.59), earning fifth in the bench press (31) and seventh in the 40 (5.16). His top result came in the vertical jump, where he tied for first place at 32.5.
O’Dowd seemed pleased with his results — on Saturday he tweeted, “Couldn’t of asked for a better day at the Combine workout today #FightOn!!!!”
Despite showing up to the Combine at 242 pounds, running back Allen Bradford managed to rank 14th-best in the three-cone drill at 6.97 seconds. The redshirt senior also had the third-most bench-press reps among backs at 28, and tied for 14th among running backs in the 40 at 4.58 seconds.
Tackle Tyron Smith had a limited participation this weekend, as he is nursing a knee injury. The junior did put up 29 reps in the bench press at the Combine, and arrived weighing 305 pounds — 25 more than he was listed at while playing at USC — easing some scouts’ fears that he was too small to play as tackle in NFL. He’ll complete his speed and agility tests at his pro day on March 31.
The Combine ends tomorrow.

Around 12:05 a.m. last night, a fire alarm was set off on the fourth floor in Troy Hall evacuating the entire building for about an hour; however, according to Department of Public Safety officials, there was no fire.
“Someone set off a fire extinguisher as a prank and that set off the alarm.  No one hurt, no suspect identified,” DPS Cpt. David Carlisle wrote in an email.
Some Troy East residents said there were many rumors circulating the building over the cause of the fire.
“I don’t know what happened but it was around 12:05 I think and the fire alarm went off. I went out on my door and there was smoke blocking the stairway. It was obvious that there was a fire,” said Emily Luu, a sophomore majoring in biology and neuroscience.
Luu said that firefighters came within five minutes of the alarm going off and everyone had to stay evacuated for nearly 45 minutes. Luu said that at the time, the residents knew nothing.
“They didn’t tell us anything, but I really want to find out. I don’t know if they know the cause, I just know they didn’t tell anyone,” Luu said.
However, Carlisle said that there was no fire according to their reports and that the smoke was the discharge from the fire extinguisher.

After introducing herself to the music world with “Whip My Hair” on October 26, 2010, Willow Smith is back at it again with “21st Century Girl.”
The single will go on sale on Itunes this Tuesday and Smith is due to perform on an upcoming episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show.
Evidently, Smith is a daring and adventurous performer, especially given the fact that she is so young.
However, there seems to be a divide amongst listeners as to her actual talent and musical worth, creating uncertainty as to the reception of her new single.
While many praise Smith for serving as a role model for kids who want to break out in the music industry and for creating appropriate and inexplicit hip-hop music, others view Smith’s work as a fabricated, auto-tuned exploit and believe her to be famous only because of her parents, actors and musicians Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith.
Just take a look on Itunes reviews of “Whip My Hair” to see the controversy for yourself. Whether you think she’s growing up too quickly or that she is indeed the next big thing, there’s no denying that Willow Smith is here to make a statement.
Now the question is whether this 21st century girl will turn out to be a success or just a one-hit-wonder.
