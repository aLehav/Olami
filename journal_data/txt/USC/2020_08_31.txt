The recent parties that have occurred in off-campus housing — despite strict calls for social distancing in light of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak — spell trouble for students living on or near campus, as well as the greater South Central community.
With the coronavirus pandemic continuing to rage in full force across the United States — Los Angeles in particular (L.A. County holds the most cases by a large margin with a whopping 240,000) — the questionable choice for many students to return to USC involves several factors. For some, living situations were not conducive to proper learning; for others, apartment leases were locked in and non-refundable.  
Whatever the reason, students arriving at USC for the fall semester now find themselves in a precarious situation — when presented with the option to finally socialize after months of isolation, students are expected to strictly follow social distancing mandates. Disappointingly and, well, unsurprisingly, these students seem to have failed.
Recently, photos and videos on USC’s Reddit page have surfaced showing students at University Gateway, an apartment housing complex just off campus, partying together in public as if the coronavirus mandates never existed. 
The quick and obvious response is to criticize the students involved; after all, they are the ones making the choice to go out and party during a time in which it is absolutely crucial to maintain social distancing. Considering the fact that Gateway residents share elevators, hallways and living spaces, it is not too farfetched to imagine that if (or when) one of these students contracts the coronavirus, Gateway, among other akin off-campus housing complexes, will find itself mired as an infection hotspot. 
Perhaps such havoc is not so far off. On Aug. 27, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman confirmed in a media briefing that out of around 1,600 coronavirus tests, 73 students within the University Park Campus community tested positive for the virus, with the first three cases being identified in on-campus housing. To think things are going to magically level off and slow down in the coming weeks would be wishful thinking. That being said, as much as students should be criticized for breaking social distancing protocols, criticism should also be directed toward the University for handling the coronavirus outbreak in a way that pushed more students to live near campus, therefore increasing the overall associated risk.
In early June, the University was optimistically and perhaps naively planning for an in-person semester — no one knew what August would look like in July, let alone June. Despite this uncertainty, President Carol Folt saw it fit to preserve students’ hope that the University would be able to provide in-person classes. Despite the subsequent backtrack to a hybrid model in late June, the impression that there would be any on-campus activity certainly incentivized students to return to campus. 
Yet not long after, on July 1, the University announced that classes would be held entirely online, noting that many students had a deadline to secure off-campus leases that same day. Although USC offered its students the bare minimum by sending this email just before leases were locked in, it was sent at 9:16 p.m. PST. For the 70% of students with off-campus leasing who theoretically had less than three hours to figure out whether they would maintain their leases or waste thousands of dollars, such a last-minute change of plan was careless and reckless.
With each passing day this summer and as California coronavirus cases skyrocketed, the fate of the academic year became clearer and clearer. Point being: There was no need for USC to hedge its bets on an in-person semester at the expense of students who otherwise would have made the appropriate decision to take their classes from home.
The recent off-campus coronavirus case surge has troubling implications for student life near campus.Namely, if parties and large gatherings continue to the degree that they have, there might not be one for the foreseeable future. It is only a matter of time before a new wave of cases with the potential to cripple USC is ignited and chaos ensues. At the rate that cases are growing, this seems to be more of a “when” scenario than an “if.” Although criticism of reckless students is 100% valid, it is also necessary to criticize the school and its administration for its subpar approach to handling this pandemic.
All things considered, the blame certainly still lies with students who are making the personal, selfish choice to attend large gatherings and ignore social distancing protocols. It is, however, worthy of note that perhaps the problem would not be so widespread had the University remained realistic about the fate of the fall semester from the jump.

By the time this column is published, only 63 days will separate Americans from the official date of the 2020 Presidential Election. 
It does not take a USC degree to understand that Americans have endured a year unprecedented in modern United States history. Not long ago, in January, many feared that our nation was on the brink of a catastrophic war against Iran. One month after that, President Donald Trump was acquitted on two impeachment charges after a sham of a trial was organized by feckless Republican partisans in the U.S. Senate. Soon afterwards, the coronavirus spread across the world and the United States. An absence of effective leadership in the White House in the wake of the pandemic has led to over 180,000 lives cut short and 22 million jobs lost. I have yet to even touch upon the wave of civil rights demonstrations not seen since the 1960s. 
So, it might come as a surprise to many that in light of these developments, this column will focus exclusively on the state of California. An initial aversion to this decision is acceptable. I understand the concern— why focus on tree-hugging yogis or juice-cleansing TikTok stars when it truly feels as though the fate of our country is at stake in November?
Well, the reason is this: Despite what people outside the state tend to believe, California is not simply the land of botox and Kardashians. We do not all pledge our allegiance to veganism, nor do we consider hemp bras standard dress-code.
My point here is not to deride these caricatures and stereotypes. Like any other Californian, I enjoy the occasional episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” In addition, I consider veganism to be, in many respects, patriotic. 
What I am trying to say is that, to the surprise of many Americans, California is a state with real people — more people than any other state in the union, in fact — and in my humble, unfailingly unerring opinion, the hopes, dreams and aspirations of our country rest in California. Allow me to make the case. 
As previously mentioned, California is the most populous state in the nation, boasting almost 40 million residents. California is also the most productive state in America, with a GSP so large that the state alone qualifies as the world’s fifth largest economy. To put this in perspective, California’s $3.2 trillion economy is larger than the economies of both the United Kingdom and India. 
Despite these distinctions, the nationalization of our common political identity — an outcome of New York City and Washington D.C. media outlets saturating our news feeds — has led to the absence of a meaningful spotlight on California. What is lost amid California stereotypes and barbs against bleeding-heart liberalism is the fact that California’s issues are the nation’s issues. 
Consider criminal justice reform, a topic one cannot discuss without noting the fact that California is home to the world’s largest prison system and the country’s largest prosecutorial office. In the same vein, the vicious consequences of climate change have also become readily apparent for Californians. As forests and homes burn and smoke fills the air, the need to confront our environmental failures head on becomes not just a vague liberal rallying-cry, but an urgent necessity— a matter of life and death. 
For much of the country, these issues  — and other hot-button topics such as poverty and homelessness — are abstract. They are used as political talking points by unqualified cable news pundits and self-proclaimed experts, but nowhere in the country are these issues more acute than in California. Here, homelessness is not just a dog whistle used by Republicans to scare white suburban housewives; it is a real complex problem that people are desperately trying to remedy.  
Now, before my point is skewed, I want to make something abundantly clear. I have no intention of falsely painting California as some type of hellscape — that is Fox News’ job. If it is not already obvious enough, I think California is the greatest state in our country. I do not hope to bring attention to the issues facing this state because I think California is fundamentally bad; on the contrary, I want to bring attention to the challenges facing California because I think this state is fundamentally good. 
California is the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any other state in America. California is home to the city whose images and films have inspired our collective imagination — Los Angeles — the region whose technology has forever changed the way the world operates — Silicon Valley — and the fields that produce one-fourth of the food on our country’s tables — the Central Valley. 
California must be paid attention to because the state provides us with insights into where the country is, where it is going and what it should aspire to achieve. No state leads like California does, and no state stands up to the current administration like California does.
As California goes, so does the nation, and this column will go with it. 
Stuart Carson is a senior writing about California politics. He is also one of the deputy diversity & inclusion directors for the Daily Trojan. His column, “Carson on California,” runs every other Wednesday.

A music festival newbie might initially be skeptical about the quality of an event like Outside Lands moving online. Festivals are supposed to be in crowded outdoor venues filled with energetic people singing and dancing along to the music. They are not something you’d think to experience and enjoy from the comfort of your bed and pajamas. But this year’s Inside Lands virtual festival quickly proved us all wrong. 
Pulling off a pandemic miracle by mimicking the Golden Gate Park-based festival’s magic, Inside Lands, the online version of San Francisco’s Outside Lands is the newest attempt at recreating the magic of the in-person festival experience through a livestream.
The festival featured shortened pre-recorded sets from some of music’s biggest names such as Elton John and Major Lazer. These performances were nostalgic and fun, transporting the listener back to a pre-pandemic time. On top of these extravagant old sets, the festival featured live performances from rising stars today, proving why they are artists to watch. 
From the very first set, Inside Lands did an incredible job showcasing why a digital music festival is worth watching. The festival, hosted by Lyrics Born, a Japanese American rapper, kicked off day one with a strong performance by up-and-coming artist from Toronto, ODIE, whose set kicked off with his hit “North Face,” complete with smooth and rich vocals. This slow R&B song talks about Odie’s infatuation with a customer breaking up his boring day dreams while working at North Face. Odie’s performance is followed up by another up-and-coming artist Evann McIntosh, whose lyrics drip with heartbreak and sadness. 
McIntosh debuted her unreleased song “You Don’t Deserve To See Me Cry” and performed a fan favorite “Gorilla in a Skillet.” During “Gorilla in a Skillet,” she sings about “feeling so unfulfilled” and describes love as a “diet” in which she is either “flying the highest or flying without a pilot.” Coming from a 16-year-old, these lyrics are mature but demonstrate why McIntosh is an artist to watch. 
One of many talented rising stars who performed during the first day, Madeline Kenney’s sophisticated and elegant delivery of her songs “Cut the Real” and “Picture of You” highlighted her smooth and alluring voice. 
Scarypoolparty, who was the runner up on season 17 of “American Idol,” shows why he was a serious contender for the winning title. His rich voice blankets the audience during his songs “Return2Sender” and “Out Loud.” It felt like a personal serenade — even through a livestream. 
It would be impossible to finish a discussion of promising new artists from day one without mentioning Bob Moses. The Brooklyn-based Canadian duo has been on the music scene for a while but is slowly building up more recognition, and deservedly so. This virtual festival served as the debut of new music from the duo’s EP “Desire,” which featured its melodic and rich sounds. 
Day one also featured pre-recorded performances from previous years from well-established artists such as alt-J, Major Lazer and J. Cole. Alt-J’s performances of “Left Hand Free” and “Matilda” got the crowd jumping and their energy was infectious. Major Lazer’s Walshy Fire and Jillionaire did a fantastic job getting the crowd excited and involved in the performance. As with alt-J, the audience could not help but jump along to the artist’s irresistible hits “Light it Up” and “Lean On.” 
The incredible energy from the Major Lazer set was rivaled on night one only by an almost perfect performance from J. Cole. The amount of energy and passion he put into his performance was outstanding. He effortlessly slipped from his mainstream hits like “No Role Modelz” to “Love Yourz,” a song about the “beauty in the struggle” and which proudly proclaims that there is “no such thing as a life that’s better than yours.” These meaningful words are different than those typically found in J. Cole’s songs, but including this song greatly enhanced his set. 
As unforgettable as these productions were, the highlight from the first day was a pre-recorded Jack White set from his impromptu 2012 performance. The set did not occur on a large stage, which would be typical for White. Instead, it was performed at a park to whoever happened to be passing by at the time, making for an intimate experience. It came across as a serenade to the park dwellers who were fortunate enough to stumble across his unique venue. 
Day one was filled with sensational performances and indeed set up a challenge for day two. How could they possibly be topped? 
The second day tries its best with a solid performance from the psychedelic dream pop band Amo Amo, whose set begins with a rocky rendition of its hit “Missed Connection” but quickly picks up with a stellar performance of “Closer to You.” This strong showing from Amo Amo, a rising star, is just one of many from artists to watch. 
The consistently excellent showings from new artists are another unique feature of Inside Lands, whose strong points is their ability to find new talent. 
“We have a full team of booking in our office,” said Allen Scott when asked about how the festival finds new talent. “We pool concerts year-round … we are always looking for new acts.” 
This year’s virtual event increased the size of the audience for these rising stars. Instead of having a small crowd of hundreds to a couple thousand people attend their show, they are now performing to upwards of 30,000 people. 
Rising artists such as Amy Allen, with her hauntingly beautiful voice, and Nap Eyes, with the lead singers’ soothing yet powerful vocals, took advantage of this new platform to perform incredible sets. 
Night two featured extraordinary pre-recorded sets from well-known EDM and indie artists, Disclosure and Cage the Elephant. The fast tempo and bright timbre of the Disclosure and Cage the Elephant sets are energizing and make you want to get up and dance. 
The highlight of night two, however, was Elton John’s set. His performance of his hits “Tiny Dancer” and “I’m Still Standing” was outstanding. His vocal abilities are unparalleled, even at age 68, and his songs take you on an emotional journey of happiness, pain and redemption. Although he was not the closing performance of night two, nothing that went on after him even came close to matching his spectacular set. Elton John was truly the highlight of the Inside Lands festival experience. 
Even though it was pre-recorded in front of an audience of thousands of adoring fans in 2015, his set felt intimate and personal. It was a gorgeous serenade from him to all those watching. 
The Elton John performance highlighted a major positive component of the virtual festival experience: its intimacy. The viewer gets to have a front-row seat to many vibrant performances, all without the long waits, painfully long standing times or gross sunburns. It is you, on the couch, with the food of your choosing and your laptop. There is no rambunctious crowd energy, a staple of a music festival, but that’s OK. It is a private and special way to experience music.

Anyone who’s seen one of Megan Thee Stallion’s Instagram Lives knows that the Texas rapper has an uncanny ability to invite people in and make anyone watching feel starstruck. Performing live on stage to thousands of virtual viewers Saturday was no different.
The concert, hosted through Live Nation and Tidal, was Megan’s first day back after taking time off for herself and her health, and follows the massive success of her single “WAP” with Cardi B that released Aug. 7 and topped the Billboard Hot 100 ever since.
“And hotties, it’s been a very very rough 2020, it’s been a very rough few months for me. I didn’t think I was going to even be able to do this show but I did, and I just wanna tell y’all that I appreciate y’all so very very much, because if I didn’t have y’all, then I wouldn’t have a lot of people pushing me as hard as they do and I probably wouldn’t be Megan Thee motherfucking Stallion.”
Donned in a black leather bodysuit adorned with green, red and yellow sequins, Megan took the stage for her first ever virtual performance and dominated. Shrugging off technical difficulties toward the middle of the show with the quip, “I’m not perfect, never said I was,” she brought the latest and greatest of her discography, features and salutes to her oldest fans.
Megan made a fiery return to the stage with her energetic opening song “Realer.” Just a month after she was shot and received surgery on both feet, the red stage lights illuminated Thee Stallion standing firmly in her sparkling heeled boots as her name, and the stage lit up in flames. 
Megan’s struts across the stage are the same way she tackles her critics like the hot girl she is: with confidence and veracity. Following the shooting, Stallion faced criticism mainly from men accusing her of feigning injury because she had resumed her normal hot girl activities. The rapper posted a picture of her wounded foot on Instagram upset that people would accuse her of lying.
“I usually don’t address internet bullshit, but y’all are so so sick!” she wrote in the caption. “Sorry I’m not ass sad and miserable as a lot of y’all lol, but ima keep being Megan Thee Mf STALLION.”
Thee Stallion proved she is unstoppable and unbothered by the noise, and “Realer” serves as a reminder that this hot girl is still on fire.
“I keep it realer than real,” Thee Stallion rapped. “Fuck all the critics and fuck how they feel.”
Thee Stallion and her six back-up dancers took to the front of the stage with an interlude of “Slob on My Knob.” It was a much needed reminder of a tweet earlier in August where she responded to misogynistic comments about “WAP” with “Lol dudes will scream ‘slob on my knob’ word for word and crying abt WAP 😂 bye lil boy.”
After introducing her “Fever” and “Tina Snow” alter egos with “Simon Says” and “Freak Nasty,” the black stage, one second emblazoned with red and purple lights and shooting of flames and a fiery “Megan Thee Stallion” on the screen, was in the next completely dark and silent.
Outlined in bright white and illuminating, the silhouettes of Megan and the dancers read the words, “This shit is exhausting.” With heads bowed and hands up in a Black Power fist, the performers stood by as the names of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Aura Rosser, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Stephon Clark, Botham Jean, Elijah McClain, Atatiana Jefferson, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Jacob Blake passed the screen along with the circumstances of their deaths and debilitating injuries at the hands of police and white supremacists and the dates of the incidents. Before fading once again to black, the screen asked those watching to consider, “Why is it so hard being Black in America?”
Megan both received and radiated unwavering support and compassion for those affected by hate crimes and state-sanctioned violence with friends in the audience and on stage. She brought the lights back up slowly with a return to her mantra that has graced the tongues of millions, “Hot Girl Summer.”
In between bouts of choreography coordinated by JaQuel Knight, who also oversaw choreography for Thee Stallion’s BET performance and the “WAP” music video, Megan introduced every one of her back-up dancers — Ashley, Caydee, Dominique, Dnay, Corbin and Taylor — to the stage with freestyle dances to songs ranging from “Back That Thang Up” to “Who’s that Girl” to “Bald Head Hoe Shit.” Hyping them up from on and backstage, Megan continuously brought immense energy and spirit that made you forget you were watching from a screen miles away.
Always loyal to her fans, Thee Stallion performed audience requests and favorites “Captain Hook,” “Pimpin” and “Cash Shit” with bright and bold graphics of swords, muscle cars and sex talk-telephones never overshadowing her presence. 
With a setlist packed with 20 of her songs, there was never a moment to sit down — not that you wanted to — as Megan urged “I need all my hotties to stand up, wherever you at, and shake that ass.”
Recent releases “Savage,” “WAP” and “Girls in the Hood,” with an electric guitar accompaniment, rounded out the performance with a reminder of the high bar Thee Stallion has set for rap — even in a pandemic. Her infectious laughter, neverending sex positivity and always impressive talent is exactly what the world needed in a virtual performance.

Glittery eyeshadow, vintage looks and vibey electronic pop music are the semblance of Liza Kaye, a junior majoring in popular music. If you have ever scrolled through an Instagram profile and felt the need to be best friends with someone, you understand the power of Kaye’s influence through social media. 
Kaye’s Instagram flawlessly seams together artsy photos with friends and addicting videos showcasing her musical talents. Her videos exhibit her style of R&B and bedroom pop.  
Hailing from Dallas, Kaye was introduced to music at a young age by her father who plays piano. Kaye picked up piano at age 10 and is still a pianist at heart, she said. Throughout high school, she took on music production internships that helped her love for music evolve from piano to business and management. 
“I definitely want to have a hand in the business side of things without losing touch of also being a musician,” Kaye said. “I’d say just the progression of going from a pianist to a producer helped me realize that there’s lots of avenues within music.” 
Cool girl and fashionista Kaye said she loves the collaborative nature of the Thornton School of Music. Before the pandemic, the synergetic environment of the school allowed one to chat with a producer, musician and music marketing expert, all while walking down the hallway between classes. 
“Any team member you essentially need is basically right in front of you,” Kaye said. “It’s nice to have everyone you could potentially meet in one spot.”
Using her knack for piano, Kaye combines her love of playing and producing by posting covers on SoundCloud and Instagram and playing for some of her classmates. 
Beyond being a student and pianist, Kaye is also a producer and manager and interns for music mogul Nick Jarjour at A-List Music and Co. There, Kaye is in charge of running studio sessions, tracking social media analytics and monitoring rehearsals and artists and A&R. 
Kaye manages Jordyn Simone, a fellow junior popular music major, who is a singer-songwriter and was a 2018 contestant on “The Voice.” 
“At the end of the day, I like to work with an artist musically but also help them pitch to a label or work on their social media,” Kaye said. 
Kaye and Simone fit like a lock and key. The two have multiple videos together with Kaye playing piano for the sweet honey vocals of Simone. 
In a video with more than 900 views, Kaye plays while Simone covers the opening vocal track of Kanye West’s “All Falls Down.” The comments are exclusively rave reviews of the duo. 
Simone and Kaye met freshman year after a mutual friend urged the two to work together. Both were hesitant at first, but after meeting, they knew there was something special blossoming creatively between them. 
“Liza is a jack of many trades,” Simone said. “And so for that [we were] like ‘I’m trying to get my career off the ground, and you’re trying to get your career off the ground, why don’t we try to work together, you know, as friends, as good work associates and as musicians?’ So that’s kind of how it formed.” 
The two are now an inseparable duo and live together. On some days they collaborate on projects, writing and producing, while on other days they just spend quality time as friends.
“You know there’s some times where me and Liza will decide to produce a song … write something or get an idea fleshed out,” Simone said. “Then there are some days where we just get high and watch movies. It just depends.” 
HBO’s “Euphoria” was a Twitter-certified cultural reset, and many people have attempted to mimic the iconic looks from the show. Kaye embodies the female badassery of the show effortlessly, Simone said. 
“[Liza] gives edged up girl next door vibes,” Simone said. “She’s like an eccentric, eclectic art hoe.” 
Outside of Thornton, Kaye has also collaborated with 19-year-old Berklee College of Music bass performance major Zoe Sparks. After Kaye reached out to Sparks, they immediately admired each other’s talents. 
In a cover of Ariana Grande’s “Only One,” Sparks strums her bass and sings. Kaye adds a groovy piano on top of the already phenomenal vocals of Sparks. 
“She has a very unique style,” Sparks said. “I just feel like she’s really innovative with the way she goes about playing her music.” 
Post-graduation, Kaye wants to focus on A&R for an artist of her choosing and continue to stay in touch with her musical side. 
“I want to be playing all the cards with one artist,” Kaye said. “I want to be in the studio with them working on music, but I also want to be overseeing their projects. I want to make sure they’re signing with the right people and just kind of overlook everything.” 
The dynamic duo is attempting to get as much accomplished in college due to the lack of job stability in the music industry, Simone said. She and Kaye, who plans to attend graduate school abroad, aim to continue their working relationship after graduating from USC. 
“I think what makes Liza a very great human not only to be in the music industry but also as an individual is her very calm temperament,” Simone said. “When she speaks, her words are justly heard.” 
Kaye has found inspiration through her current mentor Jarjour. Jarjour began his career as a drummer and now works in A&R. 
“Essentially very similar to what I’m doing in the fact that he started from a musical background and has built into this kind of large bigger mogul that’s doing all avenues, not really tying him down to one specific career choice,” Kaye said.
Experimenting and working with music is a form of self-expression for Kaye, she said. 
“It gives such a great ability to be able to communicate raw emotions and to convey a specific feeling without specifically saying that you’re feeling this way,” Kaye said.

Jacob Blake was shot in the back by a police officer seven times last Sunday. I still haven’t watched the video, and for the sake of my mental health, I probably never will. The description of a man with his back turned being shot at while his kids watched from the backseat was enough to keep me from clicking. I never watched the George Floyd video either, but I didn’t need to watch the full eight minutes and 46 seconds of a police officer burying his knee into Floyd’s neck for the damage to be done. The screenshot alone handled that. 
Between the killing of Floyd, the video of Ahmaud Arbery’s killing, the last words of Elijah McClain, the details of Breonna Taylor’s killing and the seemingly endless other traumatic detailing of wrongful Black death, I was emotionally done for the summer. 
Luckily, I had little to no responsibilities at the time. Imagine if the coronavirus pandemic hadn’t canceled my internship and I was expected to work during all that. Wait, did I mention this all occurred during a global pandemic?
I was free to cope at my own pace. Athletes, on the other hand, were not. According to the respective owners and commissioners of each league, athletes starting new seasons and finishing postponed playoffs were more important than dealing with Black people’s collective trauma around the world.
The NBA is more than 80% Black and has players with first-hand experiences with police brutality, such as the Houston Rockets’ Thabo Sefolosha and the Milwaukee Bucks’ Sterling Brown. A handful of players including Kyrie Irving were against the NBA restart, reportedly stating “whether we want to admit it or not, we are targeted as Black men every day we wake up.” Irving was subsequently labeled a “disruptor,” and he along with the other objecting players were told their voices would be stronger if games were played.
Players joined the bubble July 7, and games tipped off July 30. A majority of players knelt, wore Black Lives Matter shirts and inserted responses like “arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor” into their postgame interviews. The players genuinely tried to redirect public attention from their play to the Black Lives Matter movement, but with Damian Lilliard routinely dropping 60 points and Luka Doncic hitting 30-foot buzzer-beaters, activism was drowned out by in-game highlights.
The amplified voice that players were guaranteed heading into the bubble didn’t reach its promised height until the players stopped playing. When the Bucks chose to strike Game 5 against the Orlando Magic last Wednesday, the rest of the NBA and most of the sports world followed suit in sitting out.
By not stepping on the court, NBA players took control of their platform and demanded change. Everyone had no choice but to listen. As a result, a dormant Wisconsin police reform bill was immediately pushed into a voting session, plans to utilize NBA arenas as polling and voting locations were put into place and coveted playoff advertising slots were reserved to promote civic engagement. Three major initiatives with the potential to impact millions of lives came from just two days of no sports. 
Imagine if the players had actually left the bubble. Better yet, imagine if it didn’t take athletes risking their careers for their billionaire team owners to take action. Could you imagine if the DeVos family, owners of the Orlando Magic and in-laws to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, genuinely wanted to better the Black community? What if more owners were like the Clippers’ Steve Ballmer, who in the last three years donated $300 million to nonprofits working in Black communities?
Maybe I’m a pessimist, but I can’t imagine a world where billionaire owners take an initiative to protect the communities their money-making athletes come from. Even in situations when it seems like the owners are doing the right thing, it feels like there’s a catch the public isn’t privy to. For example, let’s execute the purpose of this column and switch over to the music industry.
After The Weeknd pledged $500,000 in donations to the Black Lives Matter movement, he challenged major music labels to do the same. Warner Music pledged $100 million to social organizations the very next day. It’s a great story of a label swiftly responding to a call to action and repaying the community that helps make it rich, but that’s not where the story ends. The part that goes untold is that Warner Music stock went public that same day and with the free press of a nine-figure donation, its shares increased by nearly 20%. Warner Music Owner Leonard Blatavik went on to add an additional $6.6 billion to his net worth, or 66 times what he donated earlier that day.
Powerful label owners like Blatavik are no different than powerful sports owners like the DeVos family. They have enough capital and connections to make changes wherever and whenever they see fit. As impactful as the athlete strike was last week and as meaningful as contributions from artists like The Weeknd are, athletes and artists aren’t going to be the ones to push the needle on ending police brutality. 
The powerful people who cut their checks should have to burden that responsibility.

The Milwaukee Bucks’ decision not to play its Game 5 playoff matchup Wednesday against the Orlando Magic in protest of the Kenosha, Wis. police shooting of Jacob Blake triggered a domino effect around the league. Every remaining team refused to play its scheduled games that day, Thursday and Friday in solidarity with the Bucks. Protests across other leagues followed, as several WNBA and MLB teams postponed their games as well. 
But the protests across the sports world weren’t identical, neither in form nor degree. Here’s a look at the varying responses by professional sports leagues during a historic week in sports history.
NBA
In the wake of the police shooting that left Blake paralyzed from the waist down, the Bucks sat out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and to stand against police brutality. Later, the Bucks made a public statement to urge lawmakers to take immediate action.
 “We are calling for justice for Jacob Blake and demand the officers be held accountable,” the statement read. “For this to occur, it is imperative for the Wisconsin State Legislature to reconvene after months of inaction and take up meaningful measures to address issues of police accountability, brutality and criminal justice reform. We encourage all citizens to educate themselves, take peaceful and responsible action, and remember to vote on Nov. 3.” 
Shortly after, the NBA released a statement saying all games would be postponed for the day. This led players, coaches and owners to hold a meeting in the Orlando bubble to devise initiatives to fight against racial injustice. 
Initiatives included the creation of a social justice coalition to oversee the league’s role in increasing voting access, promoting civic engagement and advocating for police and criminal justice reform. In every NBA city, owners will be working with local officials to transform arenas into voting locations for the 2020 general election. The league then committed to run advertisements promoting civic engagement in national and local elections. 
Play resumed Saturday after three days of inaction on the court.
WNBA 
The WNBA took Wednesday to reflect and demand justice for Black people killed at the hands of the police. 
On Wednesday, players wore black shirts reading “Arrest the cops that killed Breonna Taylor” as they locked arms in solidarity. Later in the day, the Washington Mystics took the court to kneel as some wore shirts each containing a letter to spell out “Blake” in the front and seven black holes in the back to signify the number of times Blake was shot. 
These actions come after the league dedicated the season to social justice initiatives — including a “Say Her Name” campaign in honor of Taylor — back in early July.
Play resumed Friday. 
MLB
Three MLB games were postponed Wednesday out of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement: Cincinnati Reds vs. Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners vs. San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants. 
Seven games scheduled for Thursday were postponed as well, with the league releasing a statement in support of players not wanting to deter attention away from Kenosha.
“Given the pain in the communities of Wisconsin and beyond following the shooting of Jacob Blake, we respect the decisions of a number of players not to play tonight,” a league statement read. “Major League Baseball remains united for change in our society and we will be allies in the fight to end racism and injustice.”
Individually, outfielder Jayson Heyward of the Chicago Cubs opted not to play Wednesday hours before the Cubs took the field against the Detroit Tigers. Some teams, such as the Miami Marlins and New York Mets, took the field for a moment of silence before walking off and did not play. MLB was the only league that didn’t take a leaguewide day off.
NHL
The league opted to cancel two games in the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Thursday and Friday each. Players felt that the best decision was to postpone games and take a moment of reflection in response to the shooting of Blake. 
“Black and Brown communities continue to face real, painful experiences,” the league’s statement read. “The NHL and [NHL Players’ Association] recognize that much work remains to be done before we can play an appropriate role in a discussion centered on diversity, inclusion and social justice.”
NFL
Several teams canceled training camp practices during the week to hold a team dialogue about race and social injustice. 
The Detroit Lions stood outside its practice facility Tuesday with two phrases written on a white board: “We Won’t Be Silent” and “The World Can’t Go On.” Three players addressed the media about the message.
“We can’t be silent,” defensive end Trey Flowers said. “We cannot be going on in the world with our regular day.”
Other teams around the league such as the Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos, Green Bay Packers, Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and the Washington Football Team canceled practice Thursday. 
The Seattle Seahawks canceled Saturday’s team practice and instead used the time to make sure every player on the roster registered to vote.

Content warning: this article contains references to sexual assault and sexual abuse.
Between press conferences on campus and news stories from sexual assault survivors being shared for the first time publicly, Mishal Mahmud, in her final year of her master’s degree in film and TV production at the time, was entirely shocked at the information that was coming to light. 
She, like many other USC students, learned of the details of the case against George Tyndall — a former campus gynecologist in the USC Student Health Center who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of women — in a 2018 Los Angeles Times investigation. Mahmud felt she had no choice but to help increase the situation’s visibility as well. Over the course of two semesters, she and her production team created “Breach of Trust,” a short documentary completed in May 2019 about the case and the subsequent cover-up by USC administration, centered around the testimonies of the women involved. 
An online premiere was held July 11 following the film’s best documentary win at the First Look 2020 Industry Awards and its inclusion on the BAFTA 2020 student film shortlist.
Once Mahmud started talking to some of the women about their experiences with Tyndall in 2018, she knew she needed to make the documentary. 
They were all so wonderful and so willing to tell their story, and it developed from there,” she said. “I can’t think of a better use of my time at USC than to pursue this project.”
Kara Fein, a 2019 graduate with a master’s degree in film and TV production, worked as a co-editor on the film and attested to the raw power of the testimonies. Listening to Cindy Gilbert, who was the former nurse supervisor that first reported the abuse happening in Engemann, was especially impactful for Fein.
“I think understanding what was really going on in the Health Center, how people’s voices were being suppressed and how her job was threatened, [were] things I didn’t really know about,” Fein said. “What happened to Cindy and anyone who worked at Engemann, who was trying to come forward, who was being silenced [they are] survivors, too.”
“Breach of Trust” was developed during Fall 2018 then production commenced during the second semester of “Production III, Documentary,” a class where students pitch their film concepts, with three being selected for production. 
“The passion of the students to do this, I think, was one of the factors that influenced our selection,” said Mark Harris, a professor at the School of Cinematic Arts who oversaw direction for the project. “[It] was proposed by the students, it was clearly an issue that concerned them, and the faculty felt that it was an important issue for the [University].”
The film, which clocks in at 24 minutes, begins with Oprah’s 2018 commencement speech against the backdrop of graduates celebrating at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, which then cuts to a solemn interview with Matt Hamilton, the Los Angeles Times journalist who first covered the case. The same juxtaposition with the testimonies of victims and whistleblowers and the vibrant appearance of campus is created later in the film as well, with sweeping shots of the Center for International and Public Affairs.
“We wanted to explore how this case reflected the culture of USC at large,” Mahmud said. “I think universities are very brand conscious, especially private universities like USC that are very big on fundraising … [but] the way that you respond and handle cases like this are what really define you. And that’s where the imagery of the campus came into play.”
The film is structured to highlight the two scandals that occurred simultaneously: the cover-up by USC and the abuse itself, articulated through several interviews. Harris believes that a key strength of the film was the interviews that Mahmud conducted.
“In the beginning, Cindy only agreed to do an audio interview, [but] Mishal kept going back to Cindy and gradually persuaded her and gained her confidence to be able to appear in the film,” Harris said. “And that’s a testament to Mishal’s patience.” 
The crew encountered some challenges in production, such as when an interview with former Interim President Wanda Austin did not ultimately come to fruition, Fein said. 
“We were expecting [the interview]. As editors we’re like, ‘OK, we’re gonna use it in this way, or maybe we’ll use it in this way,’” Fein said. “We can’t wait to see what comes back [from the interview] so that we have an understanding of where the school is coming from. And then … [they] chose not to contribute. And that was really disappointing.”
According to a USC media representative, the University is unable to confirm past correspondence of previous senior officials, including the communication between former interim President Austin and the documentary’s team.
Despite being a candidate for several awards, this was not the primary goal, as it was meant to create more discussion surrounding the case, Harris said.
“Well, I’m happy,” Harris said. “I’m always happy the students get validation for their work. I think for me, my disappointment is that the film has not been widely shown [to the] University.” 
For those who see the film for the first time, particularly administrators, Fein hopes that they begin to understand the long-term trauma that a lack of transparency can create in situations of abuse. 
“I hope that they understand … the sort of everlasting pain that they can inflict as an institution,” she said. “[This incident] covered decades from when Dana was at the school, [it] was a long time ago. When Amanda was at the school, it was a long time ago. And then we had two current students. So that’s 30 years of this happening.”
However, beneath the gravity of the case, Mahmud found hope.  
“What we encountered were … people who gave us so much hope about the USC community,” Mahmud said. “Maybe the people in power were failing us. But there were students, there were employees, there were professors, who were all really coming together and demanding accountability.”

Growing up watching her mother take on long shifts, late nights and earn low wages despite her hard work, Samantha Broxton’s determination and work ethic was practically ingrained in her since the beginning of her childhood. Now, it’s made evident when looking at all she is juggling while pursuing her master’s degree in integrated design, business and technology. 
Not only is she a full-time student, but Broxton is also the founder of her own natural hair and lifestyle community, the creator of a blog centered on her personal home life and the community outreach lead for Black Girls CODE L.A.
In hopes of ultimately piloting her own startup, Broxton said she wants to incorporate her future Iovine and Young Academy degree with her previous experience in finance to truly create something that aligns with endeavors she has been involved in. Broxton wants to use the degree to build connections with entrepreneurs and other like-minded individuals who she can work with on future business ventures. 
Before seeking a degree at USC, Broxton was working in commercial finance. After receiving her bachelor’s degree from the University of South Florida in 2008, Broxton pursued commercial banking at companies such as BB&T. On the side, however, she was also working on her own passion projects, such as her blog and her natural hair and living community. Knowing the value of following one’s dreams, it was obvious to Broxton that she needed to encourage her children to explore their own interests and passions as well. 
When her 10-year-old daughter Sophie,  expressed curiosity in robotics, Broxton was committed to finding a program that would cater to her interests. After searching through several programs that worked primarily with older children, Broxton stumbled across Black Girls CODE, a non-profit organization that aims to provide Black girls from ages 7 to 17 with the technology and education to excel in STEM-related fields. 
Broxton and her daughter attended the first event for the organization’s newly launched Los Angeles chapter in 2016. Immediately after, both of them looked to become thoroughly involved in BGC. As Sophie was learning about topics including coding and 3D printing as a student, Samantha was spreading information about the organization’s missions and opportunities to other parents and caretakers as a BGC volunteer.
From the start of her involvement with Black Girls CODE, Broxton, who now serves as the community outreach lead for the organization’s L.A. chapter, noticed the impact the organization was having on her daughter. As compared to where Broxton grew up in South Florida, the area where she and her family live in Irvine, Calif. is much less ethnically and culturally diverse, which impacted her daughter’s attitude toward herself, Broxton said. 
“She became more aware of her otherness,” Broxton said of Sophie’s experience in their community. “It was really important for her to have a space in which she was around other girls that she could see herself in and other teachers and support groups that were talking about science and about the things that she was interested in, but also looked like her.” 
Jasmine Moore, the volunteer lead for BGC L.A., works with Broxton on projects to increase community engagement. Together, they build connections between the organization and companies such as Google, as well as other potential partners and sponsors. Moore said Broxton brings a unique perspective to the organization since she has two children ages 9 and 10.
“She’s very good at being relatable,” Moore said. “She knows what that demographic needs. So Samantha’s always been really passionate and excited about the work we’re doing and really getting out there and being part of the community.” 
Broxton said she hopes to help expand the organization throughout L.A. County. Bringing the group to USC’s campus is a possibility, she said. 
“I do think anything’s possible in the near future,” Broxton said. “I do think there’s a lot of really great, cool things happening as far as STEAM and STEM and inclusivity in Southern California, and organizations like USC are natural partners for that kind of work.”
In many of her endeavors, Broxton works on increasing inclusivity in predominantly white industries. Similar to the work she does with BGC, she also encourages inclusivity in other professional sectors, such as finance. It was during her experience in finance that Broxton was influenced to create SisterLocked, an online community focusing on natural hair, lifestyle, beauty and fashion. 
In many traditional industries, Black women are pressured to wear hairstyles that are not always attainable or natural for them in order to look “more professional,” Broxton said. While Broxton had locs during her corporate career, she observed that other Black women were not able to wear natural styles during their professional life. After receiving numerous questions on Facebook from women asking about her hair, Broxton founded the online community.
“Sometimes Black women are risking it all to fit a narrow societal norm, so I wanted a space to talk about natural hair [and] natural living,” Broxton said. “It doesn’t matter what your hair looks like as long as you feel good, you feel confident [and] you don’t feel forced to have it.” 
In addition to creating SisterLocked, which now has about 35,000 followers across several social media platforms, Broxton also made her own blog, Raising Self. The blog — where Broxton writes about her personal life — was made as a creative avenue during a fluctuating time in her life. Becoming a mother so soon after starting her career, Broxton said she had lots of thoughts about motherhood, work life and relationships that she wanted to express.  
“I’ve always loved storytelling, I’ve always loved communicating,” Broxton said. “It was a really good outlet during a time where it’s super scary to frame my narrative and document my journey and form community with other interesting people all around.” 
Raising Self and Broxton’s other multifaceted endeavors are just some things that she hopes to continue. In the future, she said she envisions herself as a leader in the finance industry and a volunteer within her community for years to come, but she also wants to build out her own dreams and launch her own businesses.
“I want to help build out a company that is holistic and has [a] positive presence in whatever community they’re doing work in,” Broxton said. “I do think in the latter years of my working life, I would love to help launch micro-businesses in small towns and small communities.”
Keisha Polonio, former executive director of Created Tampa, met Broxton through the organization when she volunteered to help women who have been sex trafficked or sexually exploited. From the minute the two met, Polonio said she was impressed with all that Broxton had already accomplished and is eager to see what else Broxton will achieve. 
“She’s already done so much,” Polonio said. “If she’s run this fast in her life, I just can’t wait to see the rest of her life unfold and the amazing things that she will continue to do that benefit the world around her.”
