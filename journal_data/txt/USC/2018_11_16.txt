After last Saturday’s win against UCLA, the men’s water polo team will begin its postseason this weekend in home waters for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament. Tournament play begins Friday at 9 a.m. and will conclude with the championship match at 1 p.m. Sunday.
The Trojans are looking for an NCAA berth and will enter the tournament as the No. 2 seed behind Stanford. USC has a bye in the first round and will play Cal, Penn State Behrend or Austin College in the semifinals on Saturday, depending on Friday’s results.  
A Trojan victory on Saturday would mark USC’s 12th consecutive win for their 20-win season. Last year, the team finished 27-4 overall, winning the 2017 MPSF Tournament and reaching the NCAA final for the 13th straight year. The 2018 Trojans are hoping to continue their winning streak and add a 10th NCAA title to the storied program’s collection of trophies. 
Just days after the team collected its 11th straight victory, freshman goalie Nic Porter earned the Trojans’ ninth MPSF Newcomer of the Week award of 2018. Porter had nine saves against UCLA, including a vital stop in the final minute to secure the victory. His ninth save secured an 11-11 tie entering the final minute of regulation. 
Now a four-time award winner, Porter matches freshman driver Hannes Daube’s tally of honors to date. Freshman guard Sam Krutonog also has a win to his name, giving USC nine of the 11 newcomer accolades doled out by the conference this season. 
The Trojans are currently leading the MPSF both offensively and defensively with 16.34 goals scored per game and just 5.34 goals-against per game. 
“We always want to improve our efforts at both ends of the pool,” Porter said. “Our offense has been firing lately, but we were disappointed to concede 11 goals against UCLA last time out. There’s been an added emphasis on defense this week and this is due to the attacking threats that Cal’s team poses.”
USC beat Cal twice during the regular season, and the teams are expected to face off on Saturday. The team aims to claim its third consecutive MPSF Tournament crown and extend its streak of trips to the NCAA final to 14 in a row. 
“The team has had success in the MPSF tournament in recent years, so the older players and coaches are familiar with how to be successful in this tournament,” Porter said. “We come into this tournament with a lot of confidence, but determined to play some of our best water polo and qualify for the NCAAs.”

Senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware breaks free from defenders and runs to the end zone against Cal. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
In 2010 and 2011, USC was bowl ineligible due to NCAA sanctions. Now, it seems as though bowl ineligibility is a possibility for the Trojans — this time due to an upset loss to Cal. They will take on UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Saturday to fight for a bowl game.
The Trojans are now 5-5, in line for their worst record since Pete Carroll’s first year with the program in 2001 when the team went 6-6. That looks like the best case scenario for the Trojans right now; it seems incredulous to think they’ll even be able to compete with the undefeated, No. 3-ranked Notre Dame squad set to file into the Coliseum next weekend. A win at the Rose Bowl this weekend will likely be USC’s only ticket to a .500 record, and it might not be as easy as it should be.
“I think a win against UCLA does a lot for the seniors,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It’s a unique rivalry and I think it’s important right now [for] those seniors. Those guys that have been here, we’ve done this together. To hopefully keep that bell cardinal would be a great thing.”
USC offense vs. UCLA defense
The Trojan offense has lacked a clear identity throughout the year. Its primary sources of production have been all over the place; one week the passing game entirely on its shoulders while the run game stagnates, another week the Trojans will rush for over 300 yards, and in another they’ll fail to produce any points at all. 
It seemed that this would change after Helton assumed play-calling duties two weeks ago and the subsequent victory at Oregon State, as the Trojans placed a newfound emphasis on the run game, which resulted in over 300 yards rushed.
However, the Cal loss proved that the Trojans still have no clear offensive identity. The ground game was solid, as the running backs rushed for 97 yards on 38 carries, led by redshirt senior Aca’Cedric Ware’s excellent performance. Helton said that both Ware and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai are healthy and expected to play on Saturday.
But the Trojans went away from rushing the ball as the game went on, instead choosing to put the game in freshman quarterback JT Daniels’ hands. That strategy didn’t work out so well. After a first half that saw him throw for over 150 yards and two touchdowns on a 75 percent completion rate, he failed to get going in the second half, throwing a pick and finishing the night with a 35.4 quarterback rating. The team ended the second half with 41 total yards on 31 plays. 
The return of No. 1 receiving target junior Michael Pittman this week could be a big boost to the passing offense — if he’s healthy. Pittman had been on a tear the past three weeks before his injury, with 16 catches for 352 yards and five touchdowns, all team highs over that span. Wide receivers redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown have also played well in recent weeks; at this point, the issue worth watching for is whether or not Daniels can consistently get the ball in their hands. 
On the ground, Ware has been excellent, with over 300 yards in the past two contests as he’s capitalized on the improvement of the run blocking in front of him. The Trojans would be wise to feed him heavily this week, as they face a UCLA run defense ranked 113th in the nation, giving up an average of 215.5 ground yards per game. 
The Trojans haven’t truly done so at any point this season; aside from Arizona where he had 21 carries, Ware hasn’t received over 20 in a game yet. It might be in their best interests to finally do so. 
If the Trojans do, they’ll likely be able to beat down a weak UCLA defense, one that’s given up more than 30 points in all but two games this season, quite easily. If they don’t, the success of the offense depends on which version of Daniels shows up; the difference between his performance during the first and second halves of the Cal game might be enough to sway the outcome of a game. However, against a lackluster defense like the one the Trojans will face Saturday, it’s more likely than not they’ll manage to put points on the board.
UCLA offense vs. USC defense
Though the Bruins aren’t exactly imposing on the other side of the ball either, they have enough playmakers to be dangerous on offense any given night. 
Running back Joshua Kelley has been their best weapon, with 1,078 yards and eight touchdowns from scrimmage on the year. Arizona State contained him last week, holding him to 3.8 yards per carry. 
Helton credited head coach Chip Kelly, who is in his first season at UCLA.
“I have a lot of respect for [Kelly],” Helton said. “Being one of those coaches who is an offense coach by trade, he’s one of those guys who has been an offensive genius for a long time. I’ve always looked up to him.”
The loaded fronts ASU used to slow down Kelley opened up the Bruins’ aerial attack, allowing for one-on-one opportunities down the field for tight end Caleb Wilson. 
Though UCLA has received average-at-best quarterback play most of the year, Wilson has been a force for them at tight end — he’s one of the best in the nation. He’s racked up 718 yards and four touchdowns on the year, and will look to add to that total on Saturday against the Trojans. 
The last time the Trojans played against a team with similar talent at tight end, they were manhandled by Stanford’s Kaden Smith. The defense has been suspect recently in its coverage ability, getting picked apart by Jake Luton of Oregon State. This could be a problem against the duo of Wilson and wide receiver Theo Howard, who has 513 yards and three touchdowns on the year so far. 
Although USC is 5-5, Helton is still motivated to win the game.
“You treat it like it’s the Super Bowl,” Helton said. “You treat it like it’s the championship game, and I know those kids worked extremely hard in prep this week and were very competitive and focused. They want this for themselves, for their school and for their pride.”
Prediction: USC 28, UCLA 21
USC’s lack of identity and inconsistency in every aspect of the game has made it difficult to project the team’s performances from week to week. Expect them to pull away in this one. After the nightmare of a month the Trojans have had, losing to UCLA to ensure a losing season would be the biggest blow imaginable. 
They should be able to exploit a weak Bruin defense, but their ability to hold things down on the other side of the ball is worrisome. Expect them to give up some scores, making this game closer than it should be. However, they should find a way to pull this one out.

I can’t even begin to comprehend the amount of times I have said “Oh boy!” while watching USC football this year. 
Watching the Trojans this year has done nothing but stress me out, especially as of late. The first half gives me so much hope, so much faith that head coach Clay Helton has finally banded this team together and it will get back to its top-tier status, but then the second-half performance slams all of my hopes and beliefs back to reality.
This should not fall on one person. It’s not a coaching problem. It’s not a talent problem. And it sure isn’t a matchup problem. It comes down to mental mistakes born out of frustration.
I am going to use cornerback Iman Marshall as an example, but by no means should all of the blame for the Cal loss fall on him. Marshall is a senior. He is supposed to be a leader. One of his responsibilities is to lead by example, and fighting with Cal’s sideline to give them a first down with minutes left in a 1-point game is not a good example. 
Anyone that has played a sport or has a competitive streak can attest that frustration brings out the worst in an athlete; all judgment goes out the window. But you have to ground yourself and embrace the age-old phrase, “Beat them on the scoreboard.” It’s cheesy, but whoever he was fighting isn’t going to remember taking a shove or two from Marshall. On the contrary, he is going to remember the scoreboard reading Cal 15, USC 14. 
Moreover, the penalties have to stop. Yellow laundry has plagued the Trojans this season. It is really hard to win a football game when you constantly give the opposing team free yards. The Trojans are averaging 74.9 penalty yards per game, 121st worst out of the 130-team FBS. That is unacceptable, especially considering the fact that a hefty amount of the penalties could have been easily prevented. 
If the Trojans want to have a shot at winning this crosstown rivalry against UCLA on Saturday and keep the Victory Bell at USC, it is imperative the team keeps its emotions in check.
The Trojans are a far more talented team than the Bruins. UCLA has two wins on the season. They are struggling with a lot of fresh talent and a new head coach in Chip Kelly. But UCLA’s shortcomings won’t be the deciding factor.
USC can win this game if it wants to.  But if UCLA edges a lead and the USC players and coaches continue to demonstrate their frustration, the game is lost. Look at the Cal game. USC’s first-half performance was a solid showing, a 14-point shutout lead and domination in both passing and rushing yards with just one penalty. Then, the second half rolled around. Oh boy! A 22-yard botched snap safety and an ensuing touchdown was enough to frustrate the Trojans to the point that they laid down. Cal proceeded to walk all over the Trojans and pulled off an embarrassing upset on USC’s homecoming night. 
To avoid a losing season, someone has to speak up. It doesn’t matter if it’s Helton, Marshall, freshman quarterback JT Daniels or sidelined senior linebacker Porter Gustin. But someone has to serve as a voice of reason on the sideline. Someone has to ground this team and help it play to its full potential because playing frustrated is not working.

USC’s Brand New Theatre kicked off its One Act Play Festival on Thursday with the premieres of three one act plays — each written, directed and performed by USC students.
“We’re the only student group on campus that’s doing this,” BNT President Jack Eletto, a junior majoring in theatre, said. “[We’re] allowing people to put their work up on stage.” 
The festival aims to provide playwrights with a platform to experiment and workshop their pieces. By giving them the opportunity to gauge audience responses, playwrights will receive feedback necessary to improving their works. 
“They really would not have another outlet for that before they got into the professional world,” Hailey Kragelj, a junior majoring in theatre and narrative studies, said. “We get to provide directors and actors with the space and production elements for them, so it’s really all about their work.” 
For their fall festival, BNT received about 20 one act plays to review. Its board read through each entry and discussed them with a play selection committee — BNT’s board said the group was looking for plays with different themes to ensure a diverse lineup.
“Animals,” written by Marisa Caddick, a junior majoring in theatre and narrative studies, chronicles the lives of two queer characters as they pursue a relationship. Assistant director Hamza Mirza, a junior majoring in economics, said the play intends to contrast homophobia in 1978, when the play is set, to the present day.
“For anyone to even think [LGBTQ people are] a separate entity is bizarre because we’ve come so far,” Mirza said. “It’s a wake up call — if you do think like that, you’re stuck back then.” 
In addition, director Casey Gardner, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said the message of finding love is relatable to students — even if the play doesn’t end on a hopeful note. 
“Even though this story is an LGBTQ story, I think it’s really important to establish [that] these characters are real people and that this is not a gay love story, it is a love story,” Gardner said.
Senior theater major Ithalia Price wrote and directed “Generaciónes,” a play that deals with navigating Latinx identity after moving from Mexico to the United States. Price weaves Latin music throughout to show to emphasize the characters’ cultural identities. 
“It’s bringing together these two worlds of what it means to be Latin on one side of the border to the other sides of the border, keeping your Latinidad and being proud of who you are,” Price said.
Price emphasized the misconceptions some people have about Mexican immigrants, and she hopes that her play will break stereotypes by representing the immigrant experience more holistically.
“Sina and the Eel” by Keigan Lee, a sophomore majoring in theatre, is inspired by and adapted from a Polynesian myth. To pay respect to the culture without appropriating it, the directors opted for a more stylized and nuanced approach. 
“It’s a little more kids getting around to tell a story than it is us trying to realistically portray Polynesia on stage,” director and junior theatre and journalism student Jessica Doherty said. 
Doherty said taking this approach to the material gave the team freedom to pull off some of the technical elements. For example, the play sees a character become an eel and takes place in different locations — including a beach, a forest and a house. 
“I enjoy those kind of challenges … I think it’s really fun to expand the horizons of what theatre can do,” Doherty said.
The festival will run through Sunday. Tickets are free and available on Eventbrite.

The Coen brothers’ latest project, “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” deviates from the typical film narrative by splitting into six stories, each with its own distinct plots and characters. (Photo from IMDb)
As the 2019 Oscars season approaches, an unlikely studio has made it clear that it deserves serious consideration for this year’s awards. 
With last week’s historical drama “The Outlaw King,” and Friday’s wide release, “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” Netflix has officially launched its Academy Awards campaign. The latter, which was screened at the School of Cinematic Arts this Wednesday, comes from the acclaimed writer-director duo of Joel and Ethan Coen. 
The Coen brothers, known for spinning elaborate tales out of their characters’ fatal flaws, try out a new format with “The Ballad Buster Scruggs” — a Western anthology film with six distinct, unrelated chapters. Uncommon as this format is, the Coen brothers’ new film is well-written and consistently captivating.
The Coens undoubtedly knew their film would be released on a streaming service. Netflix is known for giving directors extensive creative liberty, and the film’s anthology structure is perfect for the platform as viewers can easily digest it in spurts rather than in one sitting. Rarely does a streaming service original film win major awards, and it may be that the Academy — notorious for favoring tradition over innovation — frowns on Netflix’s intrusion into its established system. Nevertheless, “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” deserves recognition for its ingenious writing.
While the film has six individual plots rather than one cohesive narrative, the Coens manage to skillfully concoct dark and entertaining tales. They open and close each chapter with a shot of a hand turning the pages of a thick volume. Indeed, the film feels like someone reading old campfire tales to the audience, conjuring fascinating stories of the Wild West out of thin air. 
The Coens pack almost every Western trope into their ballads: outlaws, gunslingers, prospectors and even caravans on the Oregon Trail. The filmmakers’ reverence for the genre is evident, as is their desire to spin classic conventions in their own unique way. 
Exercising their screenwriting prowess, the Coens’ anthology ranges from absurdist humor in the first chapter, titled “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” to drawn-out melodrama in the final chapter, “The Girl Who Got Rattled.” All these tales exist in an unmistakably Coen universe — a stylized reality that is both harsh and unpredictable. 
“The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” is no different from the Coens’ typical tales of human imperfections; each short story features jealous, lustful or prideful characters who must face the sudden (and violent) fallout of their imperfections. For example, the giddy pride of the outlaw in the film’s opening chapter results in a Flannery O’Connor-esque realization of guilt that’s just one second too late. 
Violence is another common thread that runs through the six tales. While the Coen brothers take their time with every chapter — fearlessly elongating scenes of both dialogue and silence — the anticipation of the inevitable shootout is enough to hold viewers’ interest throughout each segment.  
The Coen brothers’ last film, “Hail, Caesar!” came and went with little notoriety. Yet, the duo continues to be relevant because their older works are regarded as indie landmarks of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Whether “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” will remain or pass on in the public consciousness is not yet known — and even though it may not compete with some of their beloved classics like “Fargo” or “The Big Lebowski” — it is the unmistakable product of the same wonderful storytellers.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
This is the final installment of “Toma Té” for the semester. I’ve had the opportunity to share my stories as a Latino student at USC with the world, delve into my identity as the son of undocumented immigrants, express my love for girl group Fifth Harmony and relive my experiences as a gay student coming out to his Catholic parents.
While my Latino identity plays a huge role in defining who I am, I still have lots to learn about my culture. For that reason, I decided to take my white-passing Mexican ass abroad to Oaxaca, Mexico in the spring. Yes, I’ll be stepping away from the Daily Trojan for a whole semester.
I’ve only been to Mexico three times before; the first time, I traveled alone as a 10-year-old without truly understanding its significance for my family. All I knew was that my parents couldn’t go with me and that I would stay with family I had never met before. 
It wasn’t until a trip last December that I really understood that my parents were vicariously experiencing Mexico through me. They haven’t been back in over 20 years because of their immigration status — my photos, videos and memories are the closest thing they have gotten to seeing their beloved home state of Durango.
I traveled to el santuario de Guadalupe, a place mi papa and mi abuelita would visit every Dec. 12 to celebrate the day of la Virgen de Guadalupe. My dad didn’t ask for any gifts or souvenirs when I went to Mexico — he only requested that I visit the spiritual place he and his mother frequented during his childhood. He asked me to take as many videos as possible and to soak everything in. When I Facetimed him from inside the church, he was moved to tears from nostalgia.
While I won’t be spending much time in Durango next spring, I’ll be finding my own identity in Oaxaca, a state I’ve never visited, through a program that delves into topics that have indirectly defined my experience as an American: migration, borders and transnational communities.
Alongside other American students interested in Latin America, I’ll be immersed in an “experiential learning” program aimed at increasing understanding of South Mexican culture.
I’ll also be learning about the immigrants who travel through Mexico to enter the United States. Despite some — including my media law professor — who called those traveling to the U.S. in migrant caravans criminals, I’ll be working to humanize the immigrants who are risking everything and fighting for better lives.
While the program will help me better understand the struggles of migrants and refugees from Central America, it will also allow me to explore my own Mexicano identity. 
Living in Oaxaca for a few months will prove to be a stark difference between a short trip to visit family, but I am grateful for and thrilled by the opportunity to learn more about who I am and about what makes my culture so beautiful.
I hope to return to USC next fall empowered and fully comfortable with all of my identities and how they intersect.
¡Nos vemos pronto USC!

Sydney Loew | Daily Trojan
On Nov. 1, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry sent out a memorandum via email to all USC students titled “Community Safety Advisory — Nonconsensual Drugging is a Crime.” In the email, Carry communicated his concern for the safety of USC students, especially at parties. He said that many students came to him expressing anxiety about their drinks being spiked with sedative drugs.
This memo may have come as a shock for some; however, it is crucial for students to be aware of the pervasiveness of drink tampering on college campuses, especially considering the size of USC and its “party school” reputation. While addressing the issue was commendable, Carry’s memo failed to adequately convey the significance of the issue by failing to mention the risk of incarceration for perpetrator sand, more importantly, possibility of injury or death for victims.
In the memo, Carry described a moving encounter with a student and touched on the illegality of spiking fellow students’ drinks nonconsensually by noting that this act is punishable by University and federal laws. The email said that students found guilty of spiking drinks with sedative drugs can face expulsion, and encouraged victims to report any incidents to the Department of Public Safety or the Office of Professionalism and Ethics.
However, the brunt of the email is a Community Safety Advisory, which lists six preventative actions that students can take at parties to avoid consuming spiked drinks: not leaving drinks unattended, opening one’s own beverages, not sharing drinks with other people, being on alert for signs of drink tampering, paying attention to the taste of drinks and seeking immediate medical attention in the event of a drugging or possible drugging.
A study published in the American Psychological Association found that out of the 6,064 students surveyed, 462 students — or 7.8 percent — reported 539 drugging incidents. Some students had even experienced drugging more than once.
Additionally, the survey found that 83 students — 1.4 percent — had confessed to either drugging someone or having knowledge of someone drugging another person. Interestingly, the study found that some of these students said their motive was not malicious. Some claimed they spiked their friends’ drinks as pranks, to calm them down or keep the party going. These prank druggings are outliers, however. The more common motive of spiking a drink is to inhibit another person as a means to commit sexual assault.
While only a small minority of students spike the drinks of others “for fun,” it’s important to note the serious threat it poses to both the perpetrator and the victim. Alcohol alone can kill, if consumed irresponsibly, and adding sedatives only increases the likelihood of serious injury or death.
From a legal standpoint, spiking someone else’s drink can result in an attempted manslaughter charge, no matter the motive. Ketamine, benzodiazepines (like Xanax, Ativan or Valium), gamma-hydroxybutyrate (commonly referred to as GHB) and rohypnol — the most common drugs used to spike drinks — can be fatal when consumed without medical supervision, especially when consumed with alcohol. 
It is also important to note that these drugs rarely have an identifiable taste or color, making it nearly impossible to know if a drink has been spiked without a drug test. Regardless of the motive, students who have spiked drinks or thought about doing so must understand the harsh, but extremely dire, reality of their actions.
While Carry’s email regarding his concern about the spiked drinks and the safety of USC students was apt and well-intentioned, it failed to stress just how grave the consequences are for those who commit such crimes and that these actions can be fatal to victims. 
Similarly, the title of the email, “Nonconsensual Drugging is a Crime,” is misleading and trivializes the severity of the issue. Not only is the action of spiking someone’s drink criminal and   amoral, but it can do potential ruin both the life of the perpetrator and the victim to the gravest degree. 
Though the email was a decent start to an honest conversation about the issue, USC must provide more practical, actionable information. More importantly, it must step up to actively prevent such crimes, rather than merely raising awareness.

The University of Southern California considers community engagement integral to its ethos, with its mission statement declaring that “in our surrounding neighborhoods … USC provides public leadership and public service.” Despite its stated intent to function as a servant-leader institution, its students are incapable of serving or leading when many of them hardly even set foot in the surrounding South Los Angeles neighborhood. Therefore, its next step toward being a responsible neighbor must be establishing a University-sponsored mentorship between USC and local high school students. 
Currently, the average USC student has little interaction with the surrounding University Park neighborhood, much less the non-USC students living there. While USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative participants take classes on campus and thousands of USC students volunteer in neighborhood schools through service programs such as Joint Educational Project, they are optional and involve only a select group of students. The prevailing reality is that USC students and local high schoolers live in separate worlds despite their close proximity. 
South L.A.’s high schoolers are in special need of a relationship with USC students, as their schools tend to have less resources and thus struggle to send students to college. Rossier School of Education professor William Tierney found in a series of studies that a successful “college-going culture” includes academic rigor, social and cultural capital, comprehensive college services and relationships with community colleges and four-year-universities. University Park schools are generally lacking in these areas; while many of them are members of USC’s Family of Schools, the Strategic Data Project’s College-Readiness Diagnostic for LAUSD found that on average, only 20 percent of students met college readiness standards for language arts, 7 percent for math and 36 percent for science.
Relationships between high schools and universities must first be established before they become fruitful pipelines to higher education. Foshay Learning Center, which is associated with USC through the NAI, is the biggest feeder school to USC, exceeding even prestigious preparatory and parochial schools. 
Expanding relationships to the inter-student level and allowing USC students to create individualized connections with local high schoolers would add to these benefits, as USC students have successfully undergone the college applications process and are capable of giving personal advice on essay prompts and financial aid forms. In addition, their student status gives them an insider’s perspective on university life. 
Another educational benefit is the opportunity to demolish stereotypes and expand student perspectives concerning University Park. Most USC students predominantly receive information about the neighborhood through the Department of Public Safety, which warns students to be wary of the community and whose emailed crime alerts feature alarming phrases such as “serious or continuing threats to students and employees.” 
Meanwhile, according to StreetsBlog LA, local youth often report being stopped by DPS and hassled with questions about who they were, where they were headed, and what business they had there. While interrogation is ostensibly necessary to ensure student safety, the lack of a holistic narrative about University Park leads students to associate the area with crime and danger, thereby inadvertently dehumanizing its inhabitants.
However, facilitating student interactions with local high schoolers exposes USC students to a second perspective rooted in appreciation and challenges any negative assumptions that they have about the neighborhood. Local students can gain access to information about the college experience and admissions process and create a tangible, positive view of the University and their possible futures there. This learning experience encourages USC students and local students to interact in a way that avoids judgments and assumptions, but instead yields a desire to examine and understand.
Given the potential of a relationship between USC students and University Park students, it is incumbent on the University to officialize this relationship’s existence, whether it be through mandating community service as a graduation requirement or even including service opportunities in orientation presentations. Regardless of what solution the University chooses to adopt, the key objective should be to include a consciousness of the local community in the official conversation.

The Center for Undergraduate Admission announced via Twitter Thursday that the application deadline to be considered for merit scholarships and certain programs has been extended from Dec. 1 to Dec. 8 for prospective students affected by the recent California wildfires.  
The USC community has been dealing with the effects of severe wildfires since last Thursday. Forty-one percent of students in the class of 2022 have permanent residence in California. 
The Woolsey fire is threatening Thousand Oaks, a community 40 miles north of South Los Angeles. In Northern California, the Camp fire is the deadliest in state history with 63 fatalities confirmed and over 600 people still missing as of Thursday evening. 
The University of California and California State University systems announced earlier this week they are extending their deadlines for prospective students affected by the wildfires, along with waiving the application fee. 
Prospective students can apply for the extended deadline through a form available on the undergraduate admission page, which will verify applicants’ personal information and whether or not they are affected by the wildfires.
Students must submit a complete application along with the extension request form by Dec. 8. If there are additional circumstances, prospective students can contact their respective admissions counselor prior to Dec. 1.

Noam Wasserman, the Jorge Paulo and Susanna Lemann Chair in Entrepreneurship at the Marshall School of Business, debuted his new book “Life is a Startup: What Founders Can Teach Us About Making Choices and Managing Change” last month. The book intends to educate readers about the basics of launching a successful start-up company. 
Since Tuesday, Wasserman has been traveling the West Coast on a book tour, speaking with founders, CEOs and executives about his research and tips for building a successful company. 
As the founding director of USC’s Founder Central Initiative, a business program for  entrepreneurial education, Wasserman has been dedicated to researching and writing about the characteristics of failed and successful companies.
“Natural inclinations and the human biases are going to cause problems for [people] as they try to go through life,” Wasserman said. “At key inflection points, it’s important to have [people] tune into all of those ahead of time, so that they can be proactive.”
Wasserman said the inspiration for his book came from a student he had when he was a professor at Harvard University, where he taught a course on the founder’s dilemma, a phenomenon in which entrepreneurs must decide to relinquish control of their company in order to attract investors. 
“[The student] said that as he was going through the founder’s dilemma course, he was seeing all the ways in which founders grapple with the same kinds of challenges … that he and his spouse were going through … and he was taking some of those best practices and bring them into the household,” Wasserman said. 
Upon hearing the student’s story, Wasserman realized that many of the problems business owners face are actually based on blind passion and inexperienced decision-making. He also realized these shortcomings are actually quite analogous to real-life situations.
“When we look at the issues that we face in our lives … We don’t face them in the extreme that founders do. We can go and usually put Band-Aids on them,” Wasserman said. “Founders are dealing with the same human issues but much more frequently and much more intensely and it forces them to go and get beyond the band-aids to go and find real solutions.” 
USC Founder Central Initiative Executive Director Michael Rivera said the book covers many important questions aspiring business owners must consider when launching start-ups.
“We cover many topics, for example, how do we network?” Rivera said. “How do we make friends in the professional setting within our company, within other companies to help set us up so that we have a beneficial professional network as well, all the way down to how do you negotiate?” 
As a former investor himself, Rivera said that his expertise, along with Wasserman’s, was crucial to the new perspectives the book addresses.
“We both benefit from having been founders, having worked with founders in the real world and then transitioning into the academic,” Rivera said. “This influences how we speak to founders, and how we speak to students who are going to be founders.” 
Wasserman hopes his book will teach readers to balance their personal lives and entrepreneurial work in a healthy way.

Against a backdrop of vibrant fireworks and electrifying music from EDM artist Ekali and rapper Tierra Whack, nearly 5,000 students gathered at McCarthy Quad Thursday to celebrate the 15th annual Conquest rally ahead of USC’s matchup with crosstown rival UCLA Saturday.
“I think [this year’s Conquest’ was different,” said Kira Stiers, co-director of the USC Concerts Committee. “We had a lot more interactive things, the experience was a lot better.” 
The event featured a ferris wheel, multiple carnival games, a jousting arena and an interactive black light tunnel where attendees could write and draw on walls with fluorescent markers. 
While USC Student Affairs and the Los Angeles Fire Marshal canceled the highly anticipated bonfire due to air quality concerns, the organizing comittee had alternative activities for attendees. 
“Pie a bRuin” allowed participants to throw pies at cutouts of Bruin bears. UCLA’s analogous rivalry rally, Beat ‘SC, also got rid of its bonfire at this year’s iteration.
“I think it’s good that they’re being sensitive about the current situations and not putting a bonfire when there are so many fires recently,” said Kimberly Montana, a senior majoring in psychology and global medicine. 
The night kicked off with a League of Legends tournament that ultimately ended in a tie.
Senior Keanu Concepcion, director of the USC Esports Union, said that the Esports competition would help “elevate” Conquest.
“We wanted to really kick [Conquest] off and show USC … we’re here to build up a community,” Concepcion said. “[The tournament] is to help showcase to students that we’re going to do Esports and gaming in a really big and fun way.”
Many attendees showed support for the debut of the campus varsity League team by cheering and shouting in the crowd.
“[The tournament] was fantastic, the players showed character,” said Gordon Bellany, USC Esports’ co-advisor. “You found out with a little adversity, what you’re made of — and they showed us that they were USC Trojans.” 
After the tournament, the Song Girls kicked off the spirit rally with colorful and energetic performances set to popular songs, including “Lose My Breath” by Destiny’s Child and “Toy Soldier” by Britney Spears. 
Other student organizations, including Trojan Dance Force, a capella group UnderSCore, dance team Breakthrough and USC Cheer also performed to invigorate the eager crowd. 
Next, the Trojan Marching Band entered McCarthy Quad playing signature gameday cadences such as the “Fight Song” and “Conquest” alongside the Song Girls and Spirit Leaders. 
Multiple athletic programs such as women’s rowing, men’s tennis, women’s water polo and men’s volleyball were introduced. The football team was later brought onstage and the rally ended with a firework show. 
Rapper Tierra Whack, known for her debut album “Whack World,” opened the concert. To hype up the crowd, the rapper  chanted, “Crack kills, if it don’t get you Whack will” and performed several songs from her discography, such as “Toe Jam,” “Bugs Life,” “Pretty Ugly” and “Fruit Salad.” 
Whack threw Red Bull into the crowd to engage with the audience. However, the audience wasn’t as responsive, according to Ishan Shan, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science. 
“Tierra Whack was great, she really hyped everyone up,” Stiers said. “She’s just such a unique presence, I think people were really surprised.”
Ekali, a Canadian DJ with a SoundCloud following of 187,000, headlined the concert. 
The set commenced with  his original song “Babylon.” He later remixed Post Malone’s “rockstar,” Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE.” and Sheck Wes’ “Mo Mamba.” USC Concerts Committee handed out LED wristbands, which flashed colorfully and in tune with Ekali’s music.
Gage Autry, a junior majoring in accounting, approved of the Concerts Committee’s bookings in the last two academic years.
“[Ekali] was pretty good,” Autry said. “They’ve been doing this EDM vibe the past couple concerts and I think it’s fun. It looks like a lot of people are having fun.” 
Ashlynn Smith, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering complimented Ekali’s set, saying that he was able to get the crowd’s attention with his bright sets and charisma. 
“I wasn’t expecting him to be as lit as he was,” Smith said.

UCLA’s Bruin Bear mascot statue was found covered in red and yellow paint Thursday morning, the UCLA Police Department department confirmed.
The discovery of the vandalism comes two days before the anticipated UCLA-USC football game. UCPD Lt. Kevin Kilgore said UCPD detectives are still working on narrowing down the timeframe of when the vandalism occurred.
“As with Tommy Trojan, the bear goes into hibernation and sometime during the last week, someone pried open the box and decided to vandalize the bear,” Kilgore said.
Both Tommy Trojan and Hecuba are currently being guarded by USC Helenes while the Trojan Knights are on suspension. Hecuba Watch Chair Seman Hemani said that the Helenes learned of the vandalism through UCLA’s meme page and that they will now be a “back on our feet” in case a similar attack occurs.
“Before that happened we had all been here as a symbolic thing and that nothing would happen but since we found out about it, we’ve been on high alert,” she said.
Los Angeles Times reported that the bear was last vandalised in 2014 when a group sprayed “SC RUNS LA” in red across the bear’s torso nine days before that year’s game. The statue was also vandalized in 2009 when someone cut through a tarp protecting the statue and poured cardinal and gold paint on it, costing UCLA $20,000 in repairs.
“I think little pranks are okay, but if it’s defacing property we don’t condone that,” Hemani said. “We’re just hoping that what they did doesn’t really affect UCLA that much.” 
The last time Tommy Trojan was vandalized was in the 1940s when UCLA students covered the statue in blue paint. The following year, the Trojan Knights wrapped Tommy Trojan in tape to protect the statue, a tradition that carries on to date.
