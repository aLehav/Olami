No. 38 women’s tennis fell to No. 29 UCLA in a non-conference match in Westwood on Thursday and is now 3-4 overall this season heading into conference play.
The Trojans got an early lead by winning the doubles point. On court 2, junior Zoë Katz paired up with sophomore Madison Westby and got the first win of the day over Terri Fleming and Kelly Shaffer with a quick 6-2 win.
On court 1, the Women of Troy were represented by No. 8 senior Giuliana Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith, while the Bruins (2-5) could count on No. 5 Catherine Harrison and Kyle McPhillips. The Bruins were able to win the match 6-2, leaving the doubles point up for grabs on court 3. There, a duo of freshmen, Jessica Failla and Rianna Valdes got their first win of the season together, battling past Alaina Miller and Kristin Wiley with the final score of 6-4, giving the Women of Troy an early advantage.
In singles, USC was able to extend its lead after a quick win on court 6 by No. 60 Valdes, who beat Shaffer with a double 6-1 in less than an hour. Being down 0-2, the Bruins got on the scoreboard after No. 21 Olmos lost to No. 19 Harrison in straight sets 4-6, 1-6 and started their comeback to victory.
On court three No. 85 Smith fell to Miller 2-6, 3-6, tying the score at 2-2. On court two, McPhillips got the first set with a bagel over No. 90 Westby. The same scenario opened the second set, as the Bruins got up an early break, 2-0. There Westby battled to get the break back and got on the scoreboard. The set went on with both players being close to each other in the score, and it ended with McPhillips beating Westby in the tiebreak, giving UCLA the first lead in the match, one point away from clinching the match.
On court 5, Katz fell short in the first set tiebreak to Fleming, before securing the second set 6-2, bringing the game to a deciding third set, essential for the Trojans to stay in the match. Meanwhile, Failla on court 4 dropped the first set in the tiebreak after being up 5-2 and won the second one 6-3.
On court 5, UCLA managed to win the final set 6-3 clinching the match at 4-2. The action kept going on court 4, and after a long battle Wiley pulled out a 7-5, giving the Bruins a 5-2 lead, finishing the comeback.
Next match marks the beginning of the Pac-12 season, with the Women of Troy taking on the Washington Huskies next Friday at 1:30 p.m. in Marks Stadium followed by another home match against Washington State on Saturday at 12:00 p.m.
The Huskies are 9-4 in non-conference play and the Cougars are currently undefeated with a 12-0 record.
No doubt about it, time to get a new head coach. Read somewhere the team was preseason ranked #2 in one poll.
Now at # 38 and falling after pathetic performance vs. ucla.

In a continuation of its event series covering the presidential race, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a panel and watch party for the Republican Debate on Thursday night. Students gathered in the Montgomery Ross Fisher building to watch the debate between the final five candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.
The event began with a panel discussion moderated by Unruh Institute director Dan Schnur and Daily Trojan editorial director Sonali Seth. The panel featured political science professor Robert Shrum, a former Democratic political consultant; Daily Trojan editor-in-chief Anshu Siripurapu; and Justin Wallin, COO/CMO of Probolsky Research.
In their discussion, the panelists focused on how presidential candidates can unseat front-runner Donald Trump from his position. With Super Tuesday — the day when half of the delegate votes will be awarded — looming, the panel discussed the strengths and weaknesses of Trump as a candidate.
“When it comes down to it, there has to be something that balances off a visceral distaste,” Wallin said. “[Trump] is just one-dimensional.”
The panel also discussed the future of the Republican party as its candidates jockey back and forth for a dominant position in the race. In the midst of the party’s debates, the panelists pointed out that the platform of the Republican party remains in question.
“It’s a party struggle; it’s an identity crisis,” Schnur said. “We’ll see tonight how they work that out.”
The first moments of the debate addressed the issue of immigration, a heated topic of debate for Republicans throughout this campaign process. Early on, fellow Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio established an attack plan of gunning for Trump, throwing insults and targeting both his past and his current policies fervently.
After immigration, the moderators moved onto the replacement of the Supreme Court Justice seat left empty by the death of Antonin Scalia. Each of the candidates took a moment to acknowledge Scalia’s role as a solid rock for the conservative vote in his time on the Supreme Court.
Rubio brought up concerns about whether Trump will stand true to conservative ideals, especially due to his support of Planned Parenthood and his neutrality on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He pointed to both of those less conservative positions as reason to doubt Trump’s ability to select a new Supreme Court Justice. Despite these types of attacks, however, the panel did not believe that the candidates were able to slow Trump at all.
“They’ve thrown the kitchen sink at Trump; if he survives, what else does the Republican party have?” Shrum said. “They’re nicking him, but I’m not sure if it’s having a big effect.”
The debate often digressed into arguments about tax returns, with Rubio and Cruz questioning Trump’s decision to not release his returns. Trump defended himself, saying that he was currently being audited and therefore could not release his returns. This was a topic of lengthy conversation, which the Unruh panelists believe only sidetracked the conversation and weakened the debate.
The final half hour of the debate focused in on smaller items of interest, such as the Apple court order, while returning to topics such as national security and immigration. Part of the debate dissolved into Rubio, Cruz and Trump yelling over one another. Though they believed that Rubio and Cruz made small ground in certain areas, the panel was in agreement that the debate did nothing to diminish Trump or to boost the Republican party as a whole.
“They haven’t gained in contrast to Trump,” Wallin said. “You can see him inflating with all the glancing blows. None of them stuck, and they wouldn’t stick to anyone. It’s hard to know what can be done to beat him. It’s almost who’s the bigger bulldog than who has a better argument.”

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Thursday that the extension of the Metro Expo line to Santa Monica will open on May 20. The Expo line includes stops at USC on Exposition Boulevard and Jefferson Boulevard.
The extension will cost $1.5 billion and run for 6.6 miles. The extension will be the first passenger train service to connect downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica since the Pacific Electric streetcar was discontinued more than 50 years ago.
The extension will include seven new stations: Palms, Westwood/Rancho Park, Expo/Sepulveda, Expo/Bundy, 26th Street/Bergamot, 17th Street/Santa Monica College and downtown Santa Monica.
The trip from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica is expected to take less than an hour, even during rush hours. The extension is expected to alleviate car traffic in Santa Monica.
The downtown Santa Monica station will be a block away from the popular Third Street Promenade. The line will run alongside the 10 Freeway.
Currently, the Metro Expo line stops at Culver City. In addition to the extension, the line will run for more than 15 miles.
Though it currently carries 30,000 passengers per day, the full Metro Expo line is expected to carry 64,000 passengers per day by 2030, according to Metro officials.

Robin Roberts, anchor on ABC News’ Good Morning America, spoke yesterday to students in Wallis Annenberg Hall about diversity in the Oscars and her thoughts on the changing journalism industry. Willow Bay, director of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, moderated the hour-long conversation and introduced Roberts as “one of the most accomplished and successful journalists of our time.”
Roberts is in Los Angeles this week because she will be hosting the red carpet pre-Oscars special on ABC at 4 p.m. on Sunday. Bay began the discussion by asking Roberts what she thought about the hashtag, “#OscarsSoWhite”, which is currently trending on social media. Some actors are refusing to watch and support the Oscars, which Roberts said has brought up real diversity issues within the Academy structure,
“Currently, the Academy membership is 94 percent caucasian and 77 percent male,” Roberts said. “They’re most likely going to have the same thoughts. I doubt many of them even saw Straight Outta Compton. Maybe it’s time that we have a little bit of a fresher perspective. They are changing how you become a member of the Academy, and they’re going to change the voting process.”
Roberts encouraged the audience to continue the diversity conversation after the Oscars are over.
“It can’t just be over on Monday,” Roberts said. “It’s our responsibility, if we’re serious about it. It’s continuing the conversation. How do you do it? By being patient and persistent.”
Speaking of patience and persistence, Roberts commented on her longevity in the industry. Roberts joked that she’s only at first base, and she has a long way to go until she reaches the dugout.
“I’m very comfortable and confident in what I’m able to bring to ABC News and Good Morning America in particular. I’m grateful that I started as a general assignment reporter, then became a news anchor, then a co-anchor and now the senior anchor on that program,” Roberts said. “I believe that I do a good job of making sure I can stay current with what’s going on, but I love the fact that I have this wealth of experience.”
Roberts was born in Alabama, grew up in Mississippi and attended Southeastern Louisiana University. She also lived in Turkey for a short period of time while her father, a Tuskegee Airman, was stationed there.
“My father was in the military, and we traveled all around the world,” Roberts said. “It was wonderful that my parents exposed us to these different cultures. All of this makes me who I am as a journalist, and that’s why it’s so important to have people from different backgrounds.”
Roberts has worked in entertainment and sports journalism, but she has no interest in entering the political arena.
“Not just ‘no,’ but ‘hell no!’” Roberts said when asked whether or not she would ever be a political journalist. “Can’t we all just get along? Again, I don’t want everybody to be in agreement. But these personal attacks … Why can’t a candidate just state their position without ripping apart who they’re running against?”
Roberts admitted that as a young adult she did not want to be a journalist at all. She dreamed of being a professional athlete. Although her athletic ability paid for her college education, she realized that she didn’t have the skill be a professional basketball player. Her older sister encouraged her to combine her passion for sports with her interest in journalism. Roberts ended up working at ESPN for 15 years before joining Good Morning America.
“I used to dream as a little kid in Mississippi with my little afro puffs that I would be a Wimbledon one day,” Roberts said. “And that I would curtsey on that hot, steamy court, and I would eat my strawberries and cream. I made it there, not with a tennis racket in my hand, but with an ESPN microphone. I made it to Wimbledon. Your dreams may not look like you think they’re going to look, but they mean every bit as much.”

USC Housing held a screening of the VICE documentary series in partnership with HBO in King Hall on Thursday. The agenda for the night included a viewing of two episodes and a special Q&A with Emmy-nominated VICE producer and correspondent Kaj Larsen, who appears in one of the episodes.
The first episode featured a segment on the Nigerian Islamic extremist group, Boko Haram as well as a piece on genetic engineering. The second episode was dedicated to the controversial issue of assisted suicide.
After the viewings, Alex Janin, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, led a discussion with Larsen, who appeared in the first episode as he covered the story of Boko Haram. Students had the opportunity to ask questions to Larsen, and many were intrigued not only by VICE’s direct approach to journalism but specifically Larsen’s personal stories, as he was so close to the devastation in Nigeria.
Larsen specializes in covering stories in conflict areas including Liberia, Burma, Afghanistan and Columbia. He is known for getting up-close-and-personal with dangerous situations. He was the first journalist to be waterboarded on national television. Part of his affinity for these types of situations comes from his training and active duty as a Navy SEAL.
“On just a sheer proximity to danger level, I think my time in the SEALs and my time deployed overseas doing missions in the global war on terror kind of gives me a different situational awareness in combat zones,” Larsen said.
On top of a heightened sense of awareness, Larsen has been able use his military network to secure interviews that other journalists don’t have access to. Specifically, Larsen got into northern Nigeria when nobody else could by employing his knowledge of a squad of mercenaries operating there.
“I have a series of relationships and a depth of understanding of military and of war and things like that, and so I think that also helps me get closer to the story,” Larsen said.
Getting “closer to the story” is an understatement, as Larsen and his team were able to secure an interview with an active commander and deputy of Boko Haram. He described the mix of conflicting emotions as he interviewed two leaders in an organization considered by many to be even more dangerous than ISIS, a group responsible for killing thousands of people and kidnapping nearly 300 school girls.
“I have a greater mission, and that’s to let the world know what’s happening and to provide insight, so I actually had to do my best to approach that interview from a place of no judgment and use it as an opportunity to learn and absorb information,” Larsen said. “So few people have ever sat down with Boko Haram that really it would be tragic to do anything other than to learn as much as possible about what motivates them, what they want and stuff like that.”
VICE is a media company that was founded in the 1990s as a punk magazine with a youthful approach to content creation. Since then, it has expanded rapidly with a diverse multimedia platform, including a vibrant web community, an HBO series and, most recently, a television channel that is set to launch on Monday. According to Larsen, VICE is unique because of its commitment to getting close to the stories.
“I think it’s sometimes really easy when we’re watching these stories to remove ourselves from what the journalists and what the reporters are actually doing, because the content is so shocking, but it’s so necessary for us to see,” Janin said after the screening.
This event was part of a series of screenings hosted by USC Housing.

Despite the fact that the Academy Awards may just be another pageant stacked upon pageant in an industry guilty of possibly the most pageantry of all the industries (even fashion understands and admits what it’s doing can veer on the superficial sometimes), it’s always fun to place bets on who might win when it comes to the crème de la crème of trophies. More often than not, the race isn’t much of a race at all, with most Best Picture frontrunners claiming the crown quickly by sweeping at earlier award shows, like the Director’s Guild of America Awards, Producer’s Guild of America Awards or the Golden Globes. But this year, the race has been neck and neck, with Spotlight, The Big Short and The Revenant vying for the top spot — and each laying a pretty good claim for it.
However, there’s little doubt that Alejandro Inarritu’s The Revenant will score the top prize, simply by the virtue that the filmmakers complained the most about their shoot. Even though a film like Mad Max: Fury Road also had a legendarily difficult six-month shoot, the players involved were less vocal about it, seemingly proving that whoever cries loud enough gets the toy to placate them, right? Despite the fact that The Revenant is just one stretched-out sequence of Leonardo DiCaprio breathing heavily and crying on cue (and climbing into a hollowed-out animal carcass), Inarritu’s sun-drenched, snowy landscapes and propensity for using only natural light will probably not only score him the Best Picture, but Best Director as well (odds are Best Cinematography will also go to the film’s cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki). DiCaprio will also probably win Best Actor —  and though he deserves it, it shouldn’t really be said that he’s winning for his work in The Revenant, but rather for being such a good loser all those times he’s been nominated in the past and lost.
Brie Larson is the one to beat for Best Actress for her portrayal of a mother in Room. Though Christian Bale gave a rousing performance in The Big Short, Sylvester Stallone will probably get the nostalgia vote and win Best Supporting Actor. Best Supporting Actress is a little tough to decipher, with good performances by Kate Winslet, Rooney Mara and Alicia Vikander, making this one a close call. Odds are it’ll go to Vikander, who gets the added boost of being young and fresh enough for Oscar voters to just generally like (the same could be said for Jennifer Lawrence a few years back).
Though Best Score should go to Jóhann Jóhannsson for Sicario, it will probably go to Ennio Morricone’s The Hateful Eight — which director Quentin Tarantino campaigned loudly for a couple months ago, referencing Morricone’s prolific music career as something that deserves recognition. Sicario in general will be ignored this year, even though Roger Deakins’ cinematography was absolutely astounding and breathtaking.
It’s a tie between Son of Saul and Mustang for Best Foreign Language Film — and if there are any shocks of the night, it will probably be if Mustang wins. Embrace of the Serpent and A War were two quiet pictures not nearly as eye-grabbing as Son of Saul or Mustang, even though the two former contenders definitely have proven their chops as films in general, but in different ways.
Editing will hopefully go to Mad Max: Fury Road, which is the black sheep of this awards season — if “black sheep” is the right phrase for something that has been universally lauded while still considered an outsider. George Miller’s apocalyptic road movie is one of the year’s best and deserves all the recognition it can get. Even if it’s only in editing, it’s better than nothing. Costume design could also go to Mad Max — Jenny Beavan did such a brilliant job with the Five Wives’ gauzy, ethereal, torn-up bandeau tops and barely there skirts. Not to mention Furiosa’s tough-girl cargo pants, strappy black boots and wicked mechanical arm. The costume design in Carol — while period perfect — can’t beat out post-apocalyptic madness, can it?
Best Documentary Feature will probably go to What Happened, Miss Simone? Documentaries are normally a quieter affair at the awards — often, audiences haven’t seen many of them to truly give their opinion one way or another, so this category is definitely an insider’s game.
Best Original Screenplay will go to Spotlight, while Best Adapted Screenplay will probably be given to The Big Short. Best Animated may be tough to call — Pixar’s Inside Out was a crowd favorite, but Charlie Kaufman’s melancholy Anomalisa may be a surprise no one was anticipating.
At the forefront of all this contending is of course the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, which, if none of these predictions are right, will definitely be addressed in the telecast come Sunday.

Five p.m. on Los Angeles roads and highways is a lot of things — none of them good. Anyone who’s driven during rush hour can attest to how stressful it is. That being said, one program at USC is determined to change the bad rap that rush hour gets, instead offering an evening of great music by some of the best artists USC has to offer.
Music@RushHour, organized by student Mak Grgic, a Doctoral student in Classical Guitar, is a series of concerts at USC that aims to give people a relaxing alternative to the stresses of driving on the roads of L.A. during peak rush hour times.
The Vocal Jazz Combo concert, which took place on Wednesday at Simon Ramo Recital Hall, in particular, showcased the talents of two jazz vocal combos.
The first combo, consisting of Marta Olson, Derek Gamlam, Olivia Morreale, Yumi Kim, Suraj Parthasarathy and Andrew Hill performed a mix of original compositions and traditional songs with a contemporary take on them providing a sound that was soothing to the ears. The second combo, made up of Omree Gal-Oz, Sol Was, Kevin Van Der Elzen, Andrew Coba and Kirstin Louie, who is also a photographer for the Daily Trojan, kept the vibe going for the second half of the concert, also performing original and traditional songs with a contemporary twist. It’s often said that jazz is much better live, and these two combos proved how true that sentiment rings; it was easy to see how much ferv the artists played with, and their genuine smiles were as infectious as the rhythm of the music they were making.
It’s especially clear to see the passion with the vocalists of the combos, which, to some, might seem like a rarity in a jazz combo at USC. Adding a vocalist to the combo adds a layer of complexity to the music.
“How they function in a group that’s led by a singer is a little bit different than how they would function in a combo that just was them … because the singer has lyrics,” said Kathleen Grace, director of both combos and a Thornton jazz studies faculty member, “They have this really strong melody combined with this story they have to tell.”
The vocalists were able to tell the stories that the lyrics of the songs were telling, taking the audience away from the intimate setting of the recital hall and into their world.
The group’s performance showcased some of the best jazz USC students have to offer, which is a rarity, according to sophomore narrative studies and music major Olivia Morreale.
“Usually, it’s a classical concert or something else. The jazz vocal combos are one of the few jazz ensembles that perform,” Morreale said.
Music@RushHour offers a number of concerts and performances, jazz being among them. To get more insight on the program, the Daily Trojan was able to ask Grgic and Brian Head, USC Thornton dean of academic programs, a few questions about Music@RushHour.
 
Daily Trojan: When did this program start?
 
Brian Head: Music@Noon began in the 1980s as a showcase for Thornton music students to perform for the greater USC community.  The concerts were held at the United University Church and were curated by James Smith, who chaired the classical guitar department until 2010.  Two years ago, the Thornton School decided to shift the time to 5 p.m. and to move it to Ramo Recital Hall, and under the direction of graduate student Mak Grgic the series has gained even more popularity.  The program has been popular among Thornton students and faculty because it showcases students across a number of internal departments and gives them a place to collaborate in innovative ways.
 
DT: What are you trying to accomplish with this program? What do you hope to get out of it?
 
Mak Grgic: Music@RushHour is geared mostly by its educational purpose. It is there to encourage our music students to think creatively about programming, choose themes for the events and present them as a showcase of both creativity and skill. In addition, students get a valuable experience of performing for a live audience while being recorded live, which always adds to the pressure. Lastly, the music faculty is encouraged to participate in the selection of their best students for the performances, which contributes to a bit of healthy competition among the student body. My hope in the end is that this series becomes a staple of excellence amongst the students, creativity that reaches beyond borders of mere musical thinking and prominence in a way that people all around campus recognize this series as having a consistent presence. I would like to see the series’ renown continue to grow amongst Thornton body and overall USC community, and continue to be a multi-stylistic Performance Class for all Thornton students.
 
DT: Who is this program for? Is there a specific audience you’re trying to reach?
 
MG: First and foremost, Musc@RushHour is here for the students. It is all about them. Whoever we can get excited about attending the events is a welcomed audience member, though we do encourage an educational component in self-marketing. With all the many events going on around town, students have to learn about the pros and cons of self-marketing. In other words, we target audiences through Graduate Student Government, Thornton marketing, flyer distribution around campus and more, but we encourage students who are performing, to participate in the process and learn how it’s done. The most important way of getting people to attend however is by word of mouth. So far, so good — I would hope to see an even bigger response from the overall USC community. Who doesn’t want to hear excellent music for an hour and then get fed — for free?!
DT: Is there anything that you want people to know about Music@RushHour that they likely don’t know already?
 
MG: Music@RushHour is about presenting music of all kinds and in a fun, relaxed environment. I would like for everyone in the USC community to be aware of this so that when they have some spare time between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., they would consider joining us for a unique experience presented by Thornton’s best students.
Music@RushHour is a great way to spend time listening to intricate sounds that USC students have to offer as opposed to stressing over massive car buildups and stressful situations on L.A. roads during rush hour. Be sure to stop by a performance or two and email events@thornton.usc.edu for more info.
Correction: A previous version of this article contained a misspelling. It is Kirstin Louie not Kristin Louie. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The empty park is lit only by a far-off streetlight, as denim-clad pairs of legs stumble down the road. It’s cold, but the bottle of wine you downed earlier means your hair hasn’t pricked up in a few hours. A random decision has left you and your friends flailing on the grass as you attempt to teach them how to do a cartwheel.
How much cologne is too much cologne? Does my left eyeliner match my right? Questions run through your mind as you get ready for the night you’ve been planning since Tuesday’s afternoon class, when a Facebook event popped up on your home screen. It’ll be a party filled with the same people you party with every Friday night, but that’s not going to stop you from looking your damn best as you traipse through the packed crowd to find alcohol and a spot to dance.
You’re walking down a street in West Hollywood trying to explore outside of Trojan Land. You’ve never been to this club before and your heart thuds as your fake ID burns in your pocket. Are they going to accept it? Are you going to be the only one turned away, forced to take an Uber home by yourself while everyone else attends a nostalgia-themed night out?
The credits of the last episode of the show you’ve been watching for days rolls over the screen. Under the fluffy blanket you got for Christmas, the duvet from Urban Outfitters and the sheets you haven’t washed in ages is your pair of sweatpants. You’re browsing the recommendations as you take a quick breather before starting your next series.
No matter what your plans are — planned or not — the right style of music can make you feel like the star of a music video or a member of a Skins-like ensemble. I, personally, am of the philosophy that your night’s soundtrack should not be determined by your plans, but by your desired vibe. And thus, that’s how we shall do this:
A sensory experience to commemorate the “live fast, die young” mantra:
Electro-indie pop with soft vocals will light up your night. Think back to middle school and high school’s MGMT obsession. “The more synth, the better” should be the motto if you’re looking for a night full of colors and windblown hair. Another route is that full-on indie feel where acoustic sounds suddenly feel overwhelming as symphony like instruments are controlled by bearded hipsters.
Sample Playlist:
“No Cars Go”
– Arcade Fire
“Chicago”
– Sufjan Stevens
“Teenage Crime”
– Adrian Lux
“Who Knows Who Cares”
– Local Natives
“Midnight City”
– M83
A night for unisex boss-ass bitches:
It’s time to take the night to a place where you’re so out of it, you think you can pull a Bruce Almighty and rope the moon closer to you. I don’t mean harsh beats and trap rap. We’re talking upbeat, bounce on the balls of your feet, think you’re immortal music. You want the world to know you’re a walking oxymoron. You’re going to be as reckless as a kid, but with the privileges of being an adult.
Sample Playlist:
“YOUNGBLOOD”
– 3OH!3
“Let It Roll”
– Flo Rida
“Half Naked & Almost Famous”
– Machine Gun Kelly
“Mind Your Manners (feat. Icona Pop)”
– Chiddy Bang
“Up Up & Away”
– Kid Cudi
That Good Ol’ Nostalgic Feelin’:
It’s plain and simple. You want to sit back, so to speak, and reminisce. It’s time to let your mind go hazy, as the feelings of a thousand good memories rush forward and your Saturday night becomes the composite of every Saturday night worth remembering. These songs are going to be more personalized. They’re not one genre, they’re a feeling. These are the songs led by the singer’s emotion.
Sample Playlist:
“DNA”
– Empire of the Sun
“Secrets on Our Lips”
– Astronautalis
“On Our Way”
– The Royal Concept
“Big Jet Plane”
– Angus and Julia Stone
“Steal Your Heart”
– Augustana

The recent pledge by Senate Republicans to refuse to meet with or vote on any Supreme Court nomination by the President has made it clear that the anti-establishment hysteria of the far right has once again reared its ugly head.
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen behavior like this from the GOP. From bothersome filibusters to all-out government shutdowns, it appears that the right has little to no intention of behaving like a first-world government, much less actually governing. Most clearly, we can observe the same phenomenon in the 2016 presidential race.
Anti-establishment candidates like Donald Trump, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are funny in a way — not necessarily funny in the sense that somebody as incendiary and antagonizing as Ted Cruz would believe the nonsensical ideology he has adopted, but funny in the sense that large masses of American voters would have such a lack of civic engagement and political education as to actually believe it, too. Anti-establishment sentiment is not successful in actually shrinking the bureaucracy, paring down government spending or augmenting states’ rights — historically speaking, especially in recent politics, all it has done is impede legislative progress and provide meaningless and annoying obstructions to objectives that eventually pass nonetheless.
Let’s get something straight. As cute as your anti-establishment whining tends to be — or not be, if you’re Donald Trump at another racist rally — the government is an establishment. America is an advanced, modern and affluent nation-state, not the Wild West backdrop in 3:10 to Yuma. We do have a government. It is an establishment. If you can’t reconcile yourself to the existence of a governing body, try life in Ghana — you might find it more suitable to your libertarian needs.
Total anti-establishment — paranoid hysteria aside — if shrinking or changing the establishment is really the main goal, the presidential election isn’t a great place to start. After local elections, state elections and finally congressional midterms, you can’t wait until the presidential election rolls around to decide you’re no longer satisfied with the “establishment.” To employ a metaphor even a backwater libertarian might understand, deciding to use the presidential election to combat establishment politics is a little like going to ice a cake and suddenly deciding you wish the cake was a different flavor. It’s a little late.
Historically, we can observe that meaningful change in democracies very rarely comes from the top down — and when it does, like FDR’s programs, it is in response to broad and intense popular pressure. It’s bottom-up progress that serves to be the most effective, both in longevity and lasting impact. Electing Donald Trump or Rand Paul will not alter the system. The president is the last piece in a puzzle of thousands. Painting that piece a different color won’t change the picture you’ve made.
Anti-establishment sentiment stems from both a lack of education as well as an overvaluation of the powers of the president. When a sector of the electorate is not only dissatisfied, but also vastly uninformed on the nature of government, anti-establishment sentiment starts to grow.
Dissatisfied voters should instead turn to congressional midterms. The only body with meaningful power to change the nature of the government establishment, at least on a national level, is Congress. If it’s new or different legislation a voter is looking for, he or she might want to try paying attention to the elections of the legislative body. Unfortunately, turnout for midterms has been historically low — it appears that the American electorate is less interested in who actually sits in a position to enact meaningful law than who sits in the Oval Office. It’s because, generally, campaign budgets for midterm elections are lower than those of the presidential campaigns, and a resulting lack of media attention on the midterms will consistently affect turnout. Improving awareness of midterm elections might help direct these sentiments toward a more appropriate place to create real change.
Either way, the pervasiveness of anti-establishment views generally does nothing but impede congressional progress and serve as a roadblock for meaningful legislation; if it’s smaller establishment you’re after, look at your midterms. But if your general dissatisfaction with the government and your “leave-me-alone” frontiersman bend make you think you might actually entertain the idea of a months-long vacant judicial appointment or detrimental government shutdown, please stay out of politics.

Earlier this month, students received an email from Dornsife Vice Dean for academic programs Steven Lamy on Smoke-Free Campus Coalition’s anonymous survey to gauge student input about smoking on campus, reigniting the debate over a campus-wide ban on smoking. A move to make campus smoke-free would demonstrate USC’s commitment to student health, as a progressive university dedicated to not only discussion, but action and implementation as well.
At USC, current restrictions prohibit smoking within 10 feet of outdoor dining areas and in enclosed buildings, vehicles and “smoke-free” designed areas. These areas, however, aren’t clearly delineated, and these rules are poorly enforced.
In April 2013, UCLA became the first UC school to implement a ban on cigarette smoke in the name of public health. By 2014, the entire UC system banned cigarettes and all other tobacco products from its campuses to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke and prevent young adults from developing a life-threatening addiction. As of Jan. 1, there are more than 1,475 smoke-free campuses across the nation, according to the Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation.
It’s about time that USC aligned itself with the regulations of other universities. On Oct. 1, 2010, USC hospitals on the Health Science Campus became smoke-free.
University Park Campus shouldn’t be any different.
The debate around a smoke-free campus has been years in the making. In April 2010, the Academic Senate  passed resolutions in support of a smoke-free campus and the USC Staff Assembly soon followed suit, passing a resolution of its own. In October 2011, the Undergraduate Student Government introduced a senate resolution recommending the addition of designated smoking areas and increased enforcement. And in April 2013, USG passed a resolution to form a student-run committee to investigate alternatives to the current smoking policy.
Ultimately though, a large culture shift will need to take place for the ban, if passed, to work as intended. All members of the university community need to take the responsibility to adhere to and enforce the policy, and to bring it to the attention of visitors and guests.
Arguments against a campus-wide ban cite infringement on students’ rights to smoke. While it is true that individuals have the choice to smoke, that right also infringes upon the health of others.
Some argue that a complete ban would demonstrate a lack of sensitivity for students who come from a culture or country where smoking does not carry the stigma it does here. While this is true to some extent, according to a 2014 report by the USC American College Health Association, 80.3 percent of international students and 68.3 percent of domestic students have never smoked cigarettes. The percentage of domestic students who report smoking cigarettes one or more days in the last month — 10.4 percent — was greater than the percentage of international students who did (8.0 percent).
If indeed USC becomes smoke-free, to facilitate the transition, it should offer more resources to help smokers quit. From over-the-counter meds to counseling programs, students need help bearing the brunt of the costs of quitting. UC Berkeley, which became tobacco-free at the end of 2014, provides free nicotine replacement therapy through University Health Services. CDC studies have shown that with fewer places to smoke, people are more likely to quit.
In addition, college seems to be a time when many begin smoking.
“Virtually nobody starts smoking after age 24 or 25,” Dr. Stanton Glantz, director of UCSF’s Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, told SF Gate. “If you can get people through the college ages and a little bit past, and they’ve either not started or they’ve stopped, then they’re pretty well taken care of.” This note goes hand-in-hand with the California Senate’s decision to raise the smoking age in the state from 18 to 21, last August.
Even without a campus-wide ban, current policies must be re-addressed. The current regulations are loosely defined and poorly enforced. For a future campus-wide ban to be effective in any way, the University must first find more effective ways to enforce its current restrictions.
According to state and national public health reports, California currently has one the lowest rates of smoking in the nation — approximately 12 percent of residents smoke, while nationwide, 19.6 percent smoke. To continue this positive trend, USC should commit to a smoke-free campus — not to punish smokers, but to move forward with public health. It’s time to clear the haze and commit to a healthier, cleaner campus.
Daily  Trojan Spring 2016 Editorial Board
As an alum (’00) and faculty member (Keck School of Medicine) who is allergic to smoke, I’ve been longing for a smoke free campus, seemingly forever. Sadly, I’ve learned not to hold my breath, as my letters to administration have gone unanswered.  It’s unfortunate that USC remains years behind the rest of our nation’s colleges and universities with regard to eliminating such a harmful and obvious health risk, in the name of infringing upon the “culture” (?) of international students. Shouldn’t we as an institution of higher learning be educating all our students about the health risks of tobacco and helping them to quit?  By the way, the Health Sciences Campus is not smoke-free at all; I routinely have to hold my breath walking across campus, always getting caught in the path of some smoker (usually an employee).  I actually became hopeful a few years ago when a renowned expert on secondhand smoke, cancer and respiratory disease, who chairs the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. EPA and the FDA’s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, joined our medical faculty. But alas, nothing has changed; I’m still chasing smokers away from windows, doors, and the loading dock in order to keep the cigarette smoke out of my office (last week, several construction workers were actually smoking indoors, filling my windowless office with smoke!).  Step up, USC – it’s waaay past quitting time.

Purrfect Study Partner • A cat, one among several, hanging out in a study area on the campus of Bogazici University in Istanbul. Ida Abhari | Daily Trojan
The campus of Bogazici University, where I am studying, is remarkable for a number of reasons. Firstly, it’s situated on the banks of the Bosphorous Strait, above Bebek, a ritzy district of Istanbul, with a sea view that any L.A. real estate agent would kill for. Secondly, the architecture of the 19th century buildings of South Campus — the school’s first campus — is beautiful to look at.
But what will probably catch your attention first is the huge number of cats and dogs on campus. There are all breeds of dogs — labradors, golden retrievers, mutts, German shepherds — and all kinds of cats. They can be found rolling in the glades of grass, chasing cars or, to put it simply and most accurately, just chilling.
What really gets me though, is the Turkish attitude toward the vast numbers of animals on campus, and indeed, across greater Istanbul. The animals are a fact of life for Istanbullus. And, in every neighborhood, they seem to be well taken care of, if not a little lonely (the dogs at least — the cats really don’t seem to care either way). On campus, there is a student club dedicated to providing shelter and food for the animals as well as a veterinarian. In neighborhoods I have walked through, residents put out bottles of water (it is not advisable to drink Istanbul tap water) and food, as well as mattresses, every few houses down. Many Turks own cats and dogs as pets, but it seems that most animals live on the streets.
The cats and, rarely, the dogs, venture into classrooms and libraries. Unlike the street cats of Los Angeles, who are often feral, the cats of Istanbul, on the whole, seem to enjoy being petted and sometimes follow pedestrians in the hopes of receiving attention. I craned my neck back through half my philosophy lecture last week to observe a giant fluffy gray cat on the lap of one of my fellow students as the professor discussed the Vedas of ancient Hinduism. And I was the only one looking — no one in class said anything or found it to be strange.
I asked my Turkish roommate if this kind of interaction with the animals was acceptable during class. She looked confused.
“So it’s okay to just bring in cats to class?” I asked, a little disbelieving.
“Yeah, of course – why not?” was her reply.
I’m not really sure what Turkish students afflicted with feline allergies do. Perhaps they just grin through the pain.
And this laissez-faire attitude stretches not only to the cats and dogs of Istanbul but also to Turkish birds which seem to have a whole different personality. At a coffee shop (okay, it was Starbucks) along the Bosphorous, a large flock of birds was on the verge of taking over our table to get pits of our pastries. They were really quite brave compared to their compatriots in the West.
The human-animal co-habitance here is all the more strange when I compare it to my experiences as a volunteer for Kitty Bungalow — a shelter a few blocks away from USC that does great work in rehoming feral cats on the streets of Los Angeles. At the shelter, new cats would come in as “students” every week, and volunteers were often assigned the task of socializing “hissy kitties” so that with increased human interaction, they could become adoptable. Older cats who were more used to the street lifestyle were spayed and/or neutered and released back to their feral colonies. Most Istanbullus would probably find the idea of such an organization laughable.
Though Istanbul is home to some similar organizations, and animal shelters do exist, on the whole, vast numbers of animals roaming the streets does not seem to be viewed as a problem here. The animals are provided with their necessities, just not necessarily in a human home.
And while I’d rather every animal have a loving home, I guess it’s okay with me, as the animals don’t seem to mind too much. And, as long as I get to chill in the grass and pet them too, of course.

I still haven’t started school yet. In the Southern Hemisphere, the summer sun stays out until 8 p.m. and Kiwi students are just now flocking back to universities to start their first semester. Meanwhile, I’ve been on the longest winter (summer?) break of my entire life, and I have to admit that I’ve been feeling a little backward.
It all started in Fiji. I am lucky enough to participate in a program organized by a company that specializes in study abroad programs, and the company takes all of the students going to New Zealand on a four-day trip to Fiji before we start school. All 90 of us took a 3-hour ferry ride to the remote island of Fiji where we stayed in little bungalows by the ocean without Wi-Fi access. Basically, we were forced to bond over the lack of access to the outside world and the inescapable heat.
That’s when I realized that I’ve spent years going to school in L.A.’s perpetual summer, but I had no idea what it meant to be hot. I thought I was putting on enough sunscreen, but 10 minutes later, I would be burnt to a crisp. I thought I would jump in the ocean to cool off, but the ocean is as warm as a bathtub. My friends and I would leave our wet towels and sweaty clothes on the porch to dry, but because of the humidity and the violent storms that rolled in, nothing ever really dried. Still, we spent our first few days feeling like we were on vacation.
Meghan Coyle | Daily Trojan
[This stretch of beach was literally right outside our bungalows on Naviti Island, Fiji.]
Then our group was hit with a nasty stomach bug and suddenly our days of beach volleyball and ocean kayaking turned into long hours of alternating between throwing up and lying in bed. As backward as it seems, the group was pretty miserable in Fiji. Let’s just say it was a major relief to touch down in Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand and the one I’ll be studying in for the next four months.
The company organized plenty of excursions for our first few days in Auckland, so we didn’t have much time to recover. We went to a tapas dinner, a wine tasting and stayed the night at a traditional Maori community house. One day, the group went canyoning, which involves a little bit of rock climbing, cliff jumping and rappelling down waterfalls. That’s when I started to embrace the backwardness of it all: the idea of going down a steep cliff backward, the idea of summer in February, the idea of the metric system and driving on the left.
There is no backward or forward, right or wrong. There’s just different. A different lifestyle in Fiji. (Fiji time is real, by the way. The people there don’t operate on a strict schedule.) A different cycle of seasons in the South Pacific. A different school system in New Zealand.
In all honesty, I’m itching to start school again, and after everything I’ve been through and done over the past few weeks, that seems the least backward.

All it takes is one click and I’m on my way down the rabbit hole of job hunting. 
It usually goes something like this: open Annenberg’s daily job and internship email, scroll through the list, find at least one company that makes me think,“Hmm maybe I could work here,” search their site, find their “Careers” page, “About Us” page and masthead, proceed to stalk the entire staff on LinkedIn, stalk a different company that one of their staff members worked at previously, search the company itself on LinkedIn to see if any of my connections already work there, find a new job posting on the recommended pages tab … repeat cycle.
Plus, you can add a few more repetitions of this cycle for each time I forget to write down the available position and company and need to go through the process all over again to find it.
This cycle has become my most commonly used way to procrastinate this semester. I guess I can justify it as productive procrastination, but I won’t tell you how many times I went through the above process while writing this blog post. I will say that the Excel sheet I made to document all these job postings, saved as “HIRE_ME” on my computer, filled up a lot more quickly than this page.
Oftentimes, I’ll fall so deep into this black hole of LinkedIn and Google searches that I’ll end up looking at a job posting and have no idea how I found it, or if I can apply any of my previous experience to this particular listing.  If I’ve learned anything this year, it’s that looking for a job is exhausting, time-consuming and overwhelming to say the least.
It doesn’t help that I’m not sure exactly what I am looking for. I know I want a career in print or digital journalism, but other than that, I find myself looking at jobs with a variety of focuses: some in print media, some in video, some magazines, some newspapers — in all corners of the country. If on Monday I was picturing myself staying in sunny Los Angeles, driving to and from work every day, on Tuesday I was longing to be back on my native coast, experiencing all four seasons and trading in a car for a New York City subway metro pass.
So far, the best approach I’ve found to combat this indecisiveness is to just apply to everything that seems remotely interesting, and see what choices I’m left with come graduation day. Read: leave the decisions until later. For now, I’m able to hide behind the veil of the potential. Potential job, potential company, potential new city, potential apartment. There’s part of me that appreciates the hypothetical nature of my future right now. Nothing seems set in stone yet, and I still have time to change my mind (even a few times over).
The multitude of potential choices at the bottom of this rabbit hole seem to go on forever, but my indecisiveness and the overwhelming feeling of being confronted with so many options is making it difficult to make this black hole a little less vast. Can I search for an answer to that predicament on LinkedIn?

Many of you seniors probably think graduation is far, far away, but as you probably know by now, second semester flies by. Soon enough, your family members will be stressing over finding the best dinner spot on graduation night. Nothing’s better than a delicious meal to celebrate your journey into the real world! Whether you have a small family with particular tastes or a large group of relatives, finding a restaurant that pleases everyone is never a simple task. I’ve compiled a short list of restaurants in the Los Angeles area that should definitely be considered for a graduation celebration dinner. It might be early in the game, but the good restaurants fill up quickly. 
Craig’s
This American restaurant is located in West Hollywood. It’s known for its incredible service and  retro vibe. Craig’s offers many American dishes like meatloaf and rib-eye steak, but also has some Italian-style entrees including Linguini Pomodoro and Fettucine Alfredo. The most popular dish on the menu is Honey-Truffle Chicken. The large, diverse menu and welcoming atmosphere make Craig’s a perfect place for a family graduation dinner. You might even see a few celebrities!

Farmshop
This unique restaurant has a warm, barn-like ambience. It serves up healthy, tasty dishes. Farmshop honors farmers and artisans by serving locally sourced, California-inspired dishes. Some popular dishes include Saffron Ricotta Cavatelli and Wild King Salmon. Family members can also enjoy sides like Rustic Sourdough Bread and Crispy Kale from the market. The atmosphere is upbeat, and there’s even a communal table that can be reserved for a large family. Though this restaurant is located a little further from USC in Santa Monica, the flavorful food and family-friendly atmosphere make it worth trying.

Cleo
If your family is looking for a glamourous Mediterranean restaurant, they should look no further than Cleo in Hollywood. All your relatives can gather at a large table and share tons of flavorful tapas. Some favorites include garlic shrimp, brussel sprouts, lamb tagine and artichoke flatbread. The menu has enough options so that everyone can easily find something they like.

Water Grill
A more traditional, relaxed restaurant than the others, Water Grill is the perfect place to celebrate graduation. The seafood served here is great quality and always fresh. It’s known for seafood but the menu is extensive and will cater to everyone’s tastes. You can enjoy anything from oysters to Pacific swordfish. The restaurant is a Downtown landmark with an inviting atmosphere and charming staff. They also have a Santa Monica location. Many people throw birthday dinners and other celebrations here.

Loveless is My Bloody Valentine’s magnum opus. It is a seminal work that many would say defined the sub-genre Shoegaze. It’s a work so ambitious that it supposedly bankrupted Creation Records. Not to mention, it’s also really weird.
Upon first listen, Loveless delivers more questions than answers. Questions like, “Why can I hardly hear a word of the vocals?” and “Is there a melody behind the noise?” and “What the hell am I listening to?” For some, those questions never get answered. That’s completely understandable; it’s undeniable that Loveless has a high barrier to entry. For myself, the moment Loveless captivated me was the second I stopped trying to make sense of it. It’s an album that operates almost entirely on feel – the effects of the album’s sonic endeavors.
Sure, most of the time you can’t really make out what vocalists Blinda Butcher and Kevin Shields are saying. But their voices merge and mingle with the music, creating an oozing and overwhelming hodgepodge of sounds. They are airy and almost mystical. And sure, Loveless can be defined as adhering to the “Wall of Sound” aesthetic. But the intricate sonic landscape guitarist and vocalist Kevin Shields — the album’s architect — produces is seemingly unprecedented. Look at the album cover — that’s exactly what this record sounds like.
Kevin Shields was not satisfied with traditional guitar sounds and melodies. He experimented with his equipment obsessively, trying desperately to develop the perfect sound for every song. Just listen to the album’s opener, “Only Shallow.” The song’s intro (and effectively, its chorus) features a guitar lead that I can only describe as resembling a wailing elephant. The chord progression is not intricate or even unique. Neither are Belinda’s vocal melodies. But Loveless is more than just the sum of its parts, as “Only Shallow” perfectly displays.
On the track “To Here Knows When,” Shields contorts his guitars to blast out continuously an ethereal medley of clattering electricity that sounds like an airplane lifting off. On top of this, he lays on a faint yet persistent synth melody. Soothing vocals can barely be heard over this barricade of sound, one that’s altogether sophisticated, mind-bending and very confusing. Ultimately, it’s a great experience.
“Sometimes” takes a simpler, yet just as effective, route. Over some modest acoustic strumming, you hear an overpowering wall of distorted tremolo guitar. Kevin Shields provides soft vocals without drums at all. The song is as straight-forward it can possibly be on this album, yet it still finds a way to sound like nothing else you’ve ever heard.
Kevin Shields’ painstaking, meltdown-inducing perfectionism certainly paid off — at least for the fans. In 1991, the year the album was released, grunge was breaking out as a new manifestation of mainstream alternative rock. But My Bloody Valentine marched to the beat of its own drum. You’d be hard-pressed to find an album in that era (as great and important as those grunge bands were) that reaches the levels of psychedelic ethereality that Loveless does.
Overall, Loveless is about aesthetic. The aesthetic it crafts is awe-inspiring. It’s no wonder it still stands as one of the greatest albums of the ’90s.

Students attended the first general body meeting of the USC Campus Climate Coalition on Wednesday to inform the student body about its progress toward making the community safer and more inclusive. 
Attendees included members of the Campus Climate Coalition Core, a group of 20-25 students who developed the Campus Climate Resolution last semester, which was passed on Nov. 10, 2015 by the Undergraduate Student Government Senate, and others personally affected by the state of the campus. Students expressed frustration with the administration’s handling of their movement and discussed their personal experience surrounding diversity at the University as well as the coalition’s future direction.
According to Moira Turner, director of diversity affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government, the national movement toward discussions on diversity across college campuses, the history of injustice on campus, and the lack of implementation of most points of the Campus Climate Resolution spurred the coalition to strengthen its position.
“We’re trying to affect the institutional mechanisms that create the culture on this campus,” Turner said.
USG Residential Senator Sabrina Enriquez also felt that students’ individual experiences with discrimination enhanced the need for the meeting.
“We want everyone to have the college experience they were promised when they toured the school, and what we’ve found is so many marginalized students are not,” Enriquez said. “That has a lot to do with structural and cultural forces.”
The meeting began with introductions, where students and others associated with their cause talked about how they found out about the meeting and how the issue affected them.
After the introductions, Turner presented the timeline of events from last semester, including the approval of the Campus Climate Resolution by USG and the Graduate Student Government and the formation of the Provost’s Diversity Task Force.
Members of the core expressed discontent with the lack of change since the passing of the resolution and discussed their experiences in dealing with the administration.
“It’s really frustrating, the fact that administration continually ignored those cries of help,” Turner said.
Though the administration has talked to students and has implemented parts of the resolution, such as requiring diversity training for student leaders, students at the meeting felt that not enough was being accomplished.
“If we decide that we want to get through this entire resolution through meetings, it’ll be in approximately 25 years,” Enriquez said.
After the resolution was passed, the coalition divided into seven “working arms” — general body, education, marketing, story sharing, direct action, alumni and advisory council — in order to apply pressure to the administration from various sides.
The education branch of the core shared promotion tactics with the general student body, while the story sharing branch explained its task to document student perspectives, including an upcoming project to record student perspectives on why cultural centers are important.
On Friday, the coalition will send a proposal to Provost Michael Quick demanding that the gates around campus, which coalition members argue have led to increased racial profiling and discrimination on campus, go down after a 40-person meeting garnered full support for the initiative.
“These gates have created a physical and symbolic barrier between USC and the surrounding community,” Enriquez said. “It’s been internalized by many members of the community and has led to a lot of hostility. There’s a big contradiction.”
The coalition would like to have others give feedback to what change they’d like to see as they plan their next steps.
“Most of the future is very unwritten at the moment,” Enriquez said. “We’re planning, we’re organizing, we’re strategizing how to get everything in the Campus Climate Resolution done. We want everything that’s in our document implemented.”
Turner agreed with the coalition’s purpose. 
“We’re trying to bring this to the forefront of university conversation on what’s going on on campus and trying to make a change,” she said.

The USC Center for Law, History and Culture held the 14th Annual Law and Humanities Distinguished Lecture, “Second Class Citizens: Dred Scott and The Roberts Court” on Wednesday at Town and Gown.
Given by Mary Frances Berry, the Geraldine R. Segal professor of American social thought and professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, the lecture included a discussion on the perception and prevalence of discrimination in society today, especially in regards to African Americans.
Author of eleven books and once a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Berry considers herself to be an “archive rack.”
Berry led into her lecture on different cases of injustice by explaining the lack of understanding about discrimination today.
“When white people, and sometimes even black people, don’t understand why ‘Black Lives Matter’ makes sense, it’s because they don’t understand the historical context which still prevails about black inferiority,” Berry said.
She made note of the fact that progress has been made in ending racial discrimination.
However, Berry stated that even today, prejudice still thwarts opportunity for some people before they have been granted the chance to start.
Berry listed a variety of different examples in which discrimination was apparent in American history.
The topics of her discussion ranged from the Dred Scott case, in which the Supreme Court determined that Dred Scott, an enslaved African-American, was not a citizen, to a situation in her own personal life when her intentions were questioned while she was simply stretching in a mall after exercising.
“I was an inferior in the mall; I was out of place” Berry said.
After discussing numerous instances and cases of discrimination, Berry took the time to express her vision in finding a remedy for the issue at hand.
“If we’re going to ever have any remedies, we’re going to have to get rid of the stereotypes and get rid of Dred Scott,” Berry said.
Essentially, Berry believes that in order to reveal the inequity as we see it, it is necessary for us to spark a social movement.
In her eyes, she believes this will happen if we have what she considers to be “hot lawyers,” or lawyers who will question things and answer the call to action in order to make a difference.
“Hot lawyers tell you how you can do what you want to do,” Berry said.
Berry claims that it is “hot lawyers,” rather than “cold lawyers,” who will carry the social change that is desired. When asked by an aspiring law student how to best be a “hot lawyer,” Berry explained that it is important to always question things and attempt to see things in a way different from the way taught to you.
“Hot lawyers try to figure out how to get to where you ought to go even if conventionally you don’t go there or there’s no way to get there,” Berry said.

The Institute for Diversity and Empowerment at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Dean’s Third Space Initiative held a discussion on the media’s influence over Jews and Muslims in the Middle East and the United States on Wednesday evening in Wallis Annenberg Hall. The panel consisted of Amit Schejter, a professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Pennsylvania State University College of Communications, and Salam Al-Marayati, executive director for the Muslim Public Affairs Council. The panel was moderated by USC Annenberg Knight Chair in Religion and Media Diane Winston.
Winston began the conversation by focusing on how digital and social media led to media disparities in the Middle East that are not seen in the U.S. Schejter responded by explaining his belief that this derives from the different effects of a wealth gap in the U.S. and a media divide in the Middle East.
“There has been a growing income gap between Jews and Palestinians in the last decade,” Schejter said. “But more interesting … is the issue of the digital divide. In the U.S. [digital divides] run mostly on economic lines, while in the Middle East there are [disparities] between Arabs and Jews. Arabs spend more time online than Jews because there is more information for them online.” 
Schejter said that there needs to be equality in media availability. 
“The middle class is out there demonstrating and it has a smartphone and it has the applications and it has everything in their hands,” Schejter said. “They are not thinking about closing gaps and providing media to the people. In a new media era it’s not enough to talk about freedom of expression — we need to talk about equality of expression.” 
Al-Marayati spoke mostly on the faulty focus of modern media and how poor connections and improper favoritism can create a disservice for consumers of  journalism. Al-Marayati discussed an inappropriately intertwined relationship between media and governmental services which can be applied equally in the U.S. and abroad.
“Today most of the press is representing what the government is saying,” Al-Marayati said. “Most people commenting are Pentagon officials or a former national security advisor or a state department advisor — there is no wall of separation between press and government. The wall of separation between the press and the government is equally important for us to live in a true democracy.” 
Al-Marayati also covered the dangers of the status quo in Middle Eastern media. He juxtaposed the U.S., which he said has more healthy and varied dialogue, with the Middle East.
“Muslim-Jewish dialogue is actually thriving in the United States,” Al-Marayati said. “You find more Muslim-Jewish dialogue in Los Angeles in New York … I think by and large because Muslims and Jews are pretty much identical in their outlook [here in the U.S.].” 
Jamie Cohen, a graduate student in Annenberg’s Master of Communication Management program, asked the speakers about the decline of Al Jazeera America, which recently announced that it would be closing its operation in the U.S. Schejter responded by saying that Al Jazeera is more of an ideological news outlet than a journalistic one, a distinction that may have put off American viewers who were looking for a different form of media. 
“Al Jazeera is a very interesting news outlet … however, I was never a fan of Al Jazeera,” Schejter said. “I look at Al Jazeera and Fox News as opposite sides of the same coin. It is more ideological than it is, to me, true journalism.”

USC graduate Gary Lai was invited to the interview stage of the Chevening Scholarship, a prestigious and highly competitive award that offers full tuition, living and traveling expenses for graduate studies at any university in the United Kingdom, after advancing past the initial application and independent reading stage. Previous winners of the award have gone on to become congressmen, prime ministers and in some cases, even presidents.
For the past 10 years Lai has been involved in activism, writing for newspapers and magazines worldwide about human development in developing countries, meeting with economists, academics and money managers — often traveling to New York while doing so.
Now 12 years after his USC graduation, Lai wants to hit the books again. Because of the lack of money in humanitarian work, he wants to get a graduate degree to increase his prospects. 
“Being an activist wasn’t very financially fruitful, hence going to grad school,” Lai said. 
The Chevening Scholarship is open to graduate students that have two to three years of professional experience and is aimed at developing global leaders. 
Funded by the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the recipients are personally selected by members of British embassies and commissions worldwide. 
Award recipients will then return to their home country to contribute to its socioeconomic development using the skills learned during their UK studies. Lai already has his sights set on one school in particular. 
“I hope to attend the University of Bristol, which is one of the highest ranking universities in the UK and whose department of economics — since I’ll be writing a dissertation as part of the course — is highly productive academically,” Lai said.
If he wins, Lai hopes to work at a consulting firm or for an investment bank.
Lai, who is originally from Hong Kong, China, studied economics at USC and graduated in 2004. Although he originally chose USC for its weather and business honors program, after taking some Dornsife classes in his freshman year, he found he wanted to switch his major. 
“I wanted to be a liberal arts major,” Lai said. “I still wanted to study a lot of the topics that a business major would, so I chose economics.”
Although he graduated in only three years, Lai made the most of his time at USC and was as involved as possible. 
“I ran a used textbook exchange online for USC students, served as the assistant managing editor of the Daily Trojan, and organized a national leadership conference with the campus organization National Association of College and University Residence Halls,” Lai said. “I spent a summer interning at Enron in Houston and volunteering with the Red Cross in disaster relief after the Allison floods in 2001 and I was also a member of the Hong Kong Students Association and the Chinese Christian fellowship at USC.”
According to Lai, he is anxious about the results, but is confident in his abilities. 
“I’m a little nervous about the interview, especially given the two-month wait until April, although it gives me time to prepare,” Lai said.
The results of the scholarship are announced at the end of June.

After an 80-69 loss at the hands of the Utah Utes snapped the Trojans’ 15-game home winning streak on Sunday, USC is back on the road this weekend to face two Pac-12 teams from the Bay Area in Stanford and Cal. 
Thursday night’s game could be challenging for the Trojans, considering their most recent loss came at the Galen Center, a place in which the Men of Troy usually dominate. In every single road trip this season, USC has played following back-to-back Trojan victories. This time, however, Southern California will not have the luxury of post-win momentum on their side. 
USC head coach Andy Enfield illustrated the importance of moving on from tough losses and the reality of playing in the Pac-12 conference after the loss to Utah. 
“[Our players] play hard every game. We have our stretches like every other team does, but when I think of our team, we’ve never had to teach effort with this team. They’re 19-8, we’re not going to get down on our players,” Enfield said. “We have two big road games coming up this week … We have a chance to win a few more games and we also know that we can lose all four because the Pac-12 is so good.” 
This season, the Trojans hold a 3-5 Pac-12 record on the road, losing by an average margin of 11.6 points, illustrating the fact that playing on the road in the Pac-12 can be a very daunting task. 
As it currently stands, Stanford is tied for tenth in the rankings with a 6-8 conference record despite a 13-12 overall record due to tough non-conference games against SMU, Villanova and Texas early in the season. 
While Stanford holds an unimpressive record, the Cardinal have in fact downed top teams such as No. 11 Oregon, No. 22 Utah and Cal at home. 
In those three wins, the Cardinal’s opponents experienced similar results in terms of a higher shooting percentage to go along with more dominant rebound and steal statistics. Against Cal and Oregon, Stanford combined to shoot 50 percent from the field including 58 percent from 3-point range. 
Not to mention, Stanford was able to defeat Utah in overtime, despite shooting 23.5 percent from deep and being out-assisted and out-blocked by the Utes. Where the Cardinal capitalized was on the Utes’ 19 turnovers as compared to eight from the Cardinal.
Stanford currently ranks third in the Pac-12 in terms of points allowed along with ranking fourth in steals and turnover margin. Where they are weaker, however, is on offense where Stanford has averaged just 69.2 points, 41.9 percent field goal percentage and 11.4 assists per game, ranked dead-last in the conference. 
Of Stanford’s 69.2 points per game, 22.5 percent can be attributed to their leading scorer Rosco Allen, who averages a team-high 15.6 points and 6.5 rebounds per game through 25 games, including seven games of 20 points or more. 
In order to limit Allen’s potential in Palo Alto, the Trojans could rely on multiple double teams and advanced schematics as some top teams already have this season. 
Where USC could also potentially conquer the Cardinal could be with improved offensive play in the paint. 
To help bolster the Men of Troy’s scoring attack, USC’s forwards will need to be able to out-muscle Stanford’s 6-foot-9 forwards Allen and Michael Humphrey who have combined for 12.7 rebounds and 25.2 points per game. USC could look to big men junior forward Nikola Jovanovic or freshman forward Chimezie Metu for some step-up defense. 
Enfield further emphasized the loss of junior forward Darion Clark and how the Trojans have been missing his physical presence in recent games.
“The teams we’re playing right now are very physical and so whenever you play physical teams, Darion’s our best rebounder per minute, one of the best in the country,” Enfield said. “Our players that are playing need to take up the slack until Darion gets back … You’re not going to win when you give up 38 points in the paint.”
Regardless though of averages, rankings or records, the Trojans believe this game is as black and white as others.
“I’ve never been, but teams are a lot better in the tournament,” junior guard Julian Jacobs said in response to USC’s mentality going into its final four games, “We feel like these games are must-win games for us on the road. We have to win these games if we want to make the tournament.” 
With just four games left in the season, including Thursday’s battle at Stanford, the Trojans are in must-win territory if they are to receive a first-round bye as a top-four seed, let alone win the Pac-12 conference. 
Following this weekend, the Men of Troy will return home to wrap up the season with games against Oregon State and Oregon at Galen Center on March  2 and 5, respectively.

If you walk into USC’s Heritage Hall, one of the first things that will catch your eye at the heart of the Hall of Champions is the charming display of six Heisman trophies wrapped around the iconic statue of a USC drum major. 
Present are the trophies won by the Trojans greats Mike Garrett, Charles White, Marcus Allen, Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and last but not least, O.J. Simpson — but that needs to change. 
Since the school’s duplicate of Simpson’s trophy was stolen back in 1994, the trophy on display for the 1968 Heisman winner is actually a replacement for the original, though it was finally recovered by detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department’s Art Theft Detail back in December 2014. 
Phony or not, Simpson’s trophy has no place being on display in Heritage Hall. In fact, its removal is long overdue. By continuing to display the trophy, USC is publicly endorsing its association with a convicted criminal whose collegiate playing days are nearly a half-century behind him.
Simpson is currently incarcerated, serving a sentence of up to 33 years after being found guilty on 10 different counts that derived from his involvement in an armed robbery of a sports memorabilia dealer, which took place in Las Vegas in 2007. 
Ironically, the guilty verdict came down exactly 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of the double homicide of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, following what was characterized as the “Trial of the Century.” 
The whole spectacle of the trial is now being chronicled in a television series titled The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which is bringing a popular question back to the forefront: Do you think O.J. did it? 
Over the years, we’ve heard arguments and testimonies for both sides and beaten that horse to death time and time again. This new true crime anthology, however, is providing millennials their first glimpse inside the courtroom and the case, which had everyone buzzing just more than 20 years ago. Consider it the millennials’ version of Court TV, which was made famous by the O.J. trial. 
In the show’s fourth episode, which showcases the trial’s jury selection or “voir dire” in legalese, USC makes a cameo.
“Are you a fan of USC football?” lead prosecutor Marcia Clark asked deputy district attorney Christopher Darden while discussing the questions that would be used to ultimately choose the jury. Darden replied by saying, “There’s a lot of Trojan fans Downtown,” referring to the venue of the trial. 
These questions or comments are not libelous or defamatory in any form, but how can they not tarnish the USC brand when its name is being used in regards to a murder trial?
Even though our justice system prides itself on the notion of “innocent until proven guilty,” the day Simpson was charged with such a heinous crime, USC should have taken a stand and removed all of Simpson’s memorabilia — not for a few days, but for good. 
Then and there, the University should have immediately dissociated from Simpson, despite the fact that he was eventually acquitted of all charges.
In the end, though, Simpson didn’t get off scot-free, as a civil court entered into a $33.5 million judgement in compensatory and punitive damages against him in 1997. 
In effect, the court found Simpson liable for the wrongful death of both Brown and Goldman, contradicting the decision in the earlier criminal case. 
Simpson was never formally stripped of his Heisman Trophy, but lacking money and assets, the large amount demanded in the judgement resulted in his very own physical trophy being sold in a court-ordered auction in 1999.
Another USC player forced to forfeit his Heisman Trophy winner under different circumstances was Reggie Bush, who continues to have almost nothing to do with USC after the University completely dissociated itself with Bush after sanctions were handed down in 2010. 
Going away from USC, Penn State removed its statue of former head football coach Joe Paterno outside Beaver Stadium after it was discovered that he had concealed allegations of child sexual abuse made against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. 
It’s understood that the conditions in each case are very much different, but it’s just hard to swallow the fact that a convict’s trophy still sits on campus for public viewing, while Paterno lost his monument, and Bush continues to play the character of “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.” To this day, Bush remains the only player to be stripped of the Heisman Trophy and I’m curious to know if the Heisman Trust ever at least weighed in on taking away Simpson’s.
Simpson very well may soon become a free man, as he is eligible for parole beginning in October 2017, but neither he nor his Heisman Trophy should be welcomed at USC.

This is an absurd article. I am livid. OJ has publicly said that he didn’t do it!! Why doesn’t anyone believe him? He even wrote a book ALL about how he did NOT do it! C’mon people!
Mr. Nourian is a student, and, presumably in his late teens or early twenties. It’s hard to have much perspective at that age, and he is in a learning environment, so allowances for faulty reasoning should be made. We can’t expect high school ball players to play at the college level or college level players to play at the pro level, and apprentice writers and thinkers should, likewise, be judged in their “weight” class.
That said, someone has failed Mr. Nourian greatly, as judged by his thinking that Mr. Simpson should have been treated as guilty at the moment charges were filed. That is alarming, and the adults in his life who think about how that would play out in “real life” should step up to explain to this young man why he is so very wrong and why the idea is so destructive and dangerous.
Should Mr. Simpson, or anyone so accused, also lose their job? Be expelled from school? Or suffer any other preemptive penalties? It is chilling that someone admitted to USC could think so. The legal principle of “innocent until proven guilty” exists precisely to prevent imposing penalties and punishments on people who have not been PROVEN guilty. Because – guess what – many of them are not.
Granted, individuals outside of court are free to form opinions of guilt or innocence. So long as they’re not on the jury, it doesn’t really matter. But we should ALL vigorously denounce as not merely unjust, but also unwise – and dangerous – the idea of penalizing someone on the basis of an accusation. Whether through the power of the state, or extra-legal action.
As to whether displaying Simpson’s Heisman inappropriately honors him, reasonable people may disagree. Can one separate honoring his achievements from honoring the man? Does displaying it cause pain to Nicole Brown’s and Ron Goldman’s families? Should we defer to that?
USC is rightly proud to honor the achievements of its student athletes. And we have many to honor! Would the school’s stature be diminished without Simpson’s Heisman? Hardly. And It would be beyond foolish to think that USC has to be ashamed that Simpson is an alum. Well beyond. But would the school invite him to a gala event honoring USC sports greats? I don’t think so. And I don’t think it should.
I’m also more sensitive to the families of the victims than to Mr. Simpson. And I certainly don’t think USC is diminished if his achievements are not highlighted. Were it my decision, I would remove any display that could be construed to honor Mr. Simpson. I think of how I would feel if my daughter’s murderer appeared to be honored. And while acquitted in the criminal trial, he WAS held civilly liable for the deaths. And of course, he is a convicted kidnapper and armed robber.
But should he have been so adjudged merely on the basis of the accusation? Absolutely not. Someone responsible for Mr. Nourian’s education ought to step up and explain to him why not.
Mr. Nourian must have a hell of a view up there on his high horse.
why would they remove it, its a testament to what he did as a college player not what he did after he retired from profootball. waste of an article. they should give reggie his trophy back as well and invite him back to the school.
what crap writing, another example of selective memory and flawed logic

Rubbish. Don’t even know how this was published. Are you looking for a job in Indianapolis?
What else would you expect some guy from Iran to write. And I suppose all the players in your sacred cow soccer were saints, both on and off the field.
Put the ethnic bashing card back in your pocket because your response illustrated that stupidity has no borders.  The article was poorly thought out.  Period.
Lots of good comments that I agree with.  Let me add that, while I didn’t know OJ at all, I did have a couple of conversations with him when he was as USC (yes I’m getting old).  He was always polite, friendly and even humble – nothing like the persona of a murderer.
He is so dramatically changed that I can’t help wonder if he has brain damage.  With what has come out in the last few years about the concussion problems with football players, it wouldn’t be a stretch at all.  This is a fellow who gained over 2000 yards some years in the NFL.  How many times did he get hit in the head?
I don’t know of course, but if that’s the case, we should be thinking of him not with hostility but with compassion and perhaps helping him in getting NFL sponsored treatment and care.  The last thing our school should be doing is piling on to the rejection he is already experiencing from most of the rest of society as this article suggests.
You should have a seat and look at the history of the gates of Troy, Bovard Hall and VKC and then see if you really want to dismantle everything by name sake. 
Don’t temp them.  Today’s coddled, mush-headed, pc student would take you up on that offer.
Whitewashing history, or removing reminders of it, doesn’t CHANGE the history. People are dead whether or not that statue is in Heritage Hall. Removing it fixes nothing. 
Also … learn what the word “ironically” means. You meant “coincidentally,” which, ironically, is the opposite of “ironically.”
So does this guy know the history of VKC and former  USC president Rufus B. Von KleinSmid and I wonder if he gets this same feeling? I don’t hear him calling for the removal of VKC name from the building.
Mr. Nourian is also obviously ignorant of the U.S. justice system.  There was no contradiction between the outcome of the criminal case and the civil case.  He was found “not guilty” in the criminal case, which requires testimony and evidence beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction.  In the civil case, there is a lower standard to be found responsible or guilty, which can be likened to a “preponderance of the evidence.”  Because of this, a person can be found not guilty in a criminal proceeding but be found responsible/guilty in a civil proceeding without there being any contradiction.
Ridiculous!   I’m not even going to let you get my blood pressure up with this rant, though I will respond is a simple way by saying, Put Reggie’s Trophy and Jersey back where it goes.  Leave OJ’s football legacy alone.  He is in Jail for the crime he was convicted of and that is his punishment!   Paterno was never punished and since when does SC want to be like Penn St. or anyone else for that matter.  Write a article about the NCAA and it unfair practices you would certainly have more material!
Was this writer born about 1995? Only someone that childlike could come up with something as lame as this “idea”. Go back to admiring yourself in the mirror and believing the world revolves around you. Stick to things (if there are any) that you know a little something about.
I couldn’t disagree more. I am also pleased to see that there is no support for this. In fact, given the irresponsible, incompetent, highly biased outcome of the NCAA ‘s investigation (and what happened with Miami) it is time to bring back Reggie’s Heisman, put his number again in the Coliseum an invite him to attend games.
If anyone’s looking for a reason why I’ve stopped making alumni donations, look no further than this poorly thought-out column.

STUPID.
The person who wrote this article needs to SERIOUSLY BE QUIET or sit down somewhere. The Simpson Heisman display should stay right where it is. OJ SIMPSON the football player has NOTHING to do with the criminal stuff he engaged in off the field. 
Darian Nourian, YOU’RE TOO GOOD OF A WRITER TO BE DOING ARTICLES LIKE THIS. I’VE BEEN READING YOUR STUFF FOR A WHILE AND THIS AINT YOU MAN. 
Darian, don’t let nobody at the Daily Trojan pressure you to write articles like this again. Kicking dirt on people while they’re down is apart of the journalism business, but Darian that doesn’t mean you have to be apart of that type of journalism.
Daily Trojan y’all know better than to put out articles like this, y’all are too good for that.
The opinion of the writer is another example of the flawed education our children are receiving in the post high school level. Universities and colleges have been infiltrated with leftist, socialist, child coddling professors and university administrators, who are not teaching our kids who to live a responsible adult life.  Safe zones, are an example of taking personal responsibility for one attitude in life.
The writers desire for USC to remove the OJ memorabilia and Heisman Trophy is absurd. Using his logic, and believe me, no one ever said liberal logic is logical….. we should remove all historical artifacts in this country, the Vatican, all government archives, based on what the the bad things they did in the past, and not the good things they did.
I think this young man should take a walk around the USC campus and find ways to be a productive citizen and work towards helping the disadvantaged in the neighborhood, not slamming a USC athlete for his work while a student, even though he “may have” committed a heinous crime many decades later.
You may have attended but it appears you didn’t receive an education. I don’t agree with the writer but is ridiculous to characterize the opinion as a result of ‘leftist, socialist, child codling professors’, etc. You need to grow up or maybe join Trump.
You know nothing about me or my political preference, so perhaps you might reconsider your rebuttal, which is a stretch.  You might consider reading a bit about the political ideologies that are prevalent in our university system and the effect they have on our kids today.  Helicopter parenting and leftist, “progressive” professors and admin staff are “pussyfying” our kids.   Same thing happened in the 60’s with the communists, socialists working to subvert our university system, which they accomplished…..  A lot of those students are in positions of power and leadership today in America, politically, and as CEOs, etc…  Just take a look at some of these folks… The Clintons, Bert-n-Ernie Sanders, Peolsi, Reid, Obama’s mentors, who are anarchists Dorn and Ayers, just to name a few.  Perhpas you might want to join the Trump bandwagon, or for that matter Cruz and Rubio or even Kasich.  You’ll learn something meaningful that you can live by.
You reveal your politics with your inane rant. Keep listening to Fox that is Faux News. They will keep you filled with paranoia and ignorance. In the meantime, make sure to never respect others with a different point of view.
You should reread your latest rebuttal. What you accuse me of is what you started and are doing now. Fight on.
I didn’t start the rant. I am just very tired of all of bellicose hyperbole about the left, socialism, etc. etc. We can disagree but that doesn’t the other person is part of a plot to destroy the values of our society. Reasonable people can disagree . . .isn’t what democracy is all about?

The anarchist analogy was towards Dorn and Ayers.  They are domestic terrorists (google The Weather Underground)  that have been allowed to infiltrate our universities and have been given tenure by their left wing oriented university.
When was the last time you were on campus…or any campus for that matter??  Today’s Millennial generation has an expectation level of, I can say what I want, when I want, and do not challenge my opinion.  They have taken the 1st Amendment and turned it into a one-way street.  In other words, THEIR 1st Amendment right carries more weight and if you push back(figuratively speaking of course) they get offended as if someone took the teddy bear away and ripped it’s head off.  Remember when earning something through hard work meant something?  Now it’s “I deserve” with no skin in the game other than an emotional attachment.  And yes, this paradigm is being brought forward by many of the professors tenured as well as non-tenured.
The saddest part is that starts at home with the parents.
Darian is clearly not a football fan and I question whether or not he is proud of being a Trojan.  He has a right to his opinion though, even if it is sophomoric and moronic. 
Sophomoric and moronic indeed! GeorgeCurious, I AM a football fan, and OJ was a BEAST on the field! How dare Mr. Nourian try to take away his accomplishments.
The more I pay attention to college students today the more I think no one should be allowed to vote before they are  30. This is the most mush-brained generation ever. Perhaps the writer thinks USC displaying Simpson’s Heisman is a “mircro-aggression” and he might need a “safe space” to process his dainty feelings of oppression…
Does the author of this poorly conceived thesis need a safe room to curl up in a fetal position?
An absolutely worthless article.
i do not know which idiot millennial wrote this….but they really need a lesson in life… as in LONG LIFE. On what weirdo planet should USC remove Simpson’s trophy because of why he did decades after the fact? This article is another perverse result of the “victim” culture that thinks “feelings” are more important than facts.
This article is a joke. 
“Even though our justice system prides itself on the notion of “innocent until proven guilty,” the day Simpson was charged with such a heinous crime, USC should have taken a stand and removed all of Simpson’s memorabilia — not for a few days, but for good.”
Seriously? So you’re saying even if USC knew there was a chance O.J. were eventually found not guilty of the crime that USC should have withdrawn support of an alum who actually did some pretty great things for the University and was one of its highest profile athletes ever? Do you have any idea how many erroneous charges are brought against individuals who, based on an even cursory review of evidence, have no business being charged? 
So based on a public suspicion of guilt BEFORE the legal process plays out AT ALL, we should completely ignore the legal process and then assume someone who — it’s important to note — has done more for this University in three years than this self-righteous and smug wannabe journalist will probably do in his entire lifetime? Wow. I’ve heard some ungrateful crap in my life but cannibalizing any of the positives O.J. might have left with his legacy in the interest of thumbing your nose down on him in a column is a shining example of why everyone is losing faith in millenials. No respect, whatsoever, not even in the place where O.J. had a palpable positive impact that led countless recruits to sign up to wear the Cardinal and Gold. If you are even capable of feeling shame, you should be disappointed in yourself for writing something this lazy and poorly thought-out. You’re not a Trojan, you’re a short-witted opportunist with a pen.
Stop trying to change history. This is what the NCAA did to Reggie Bush. OJ committed crimes 30 years after playing at USC. USC is not responsible for the crimes committed by their alumni, especially when those crimes are committed several decades later.
Naw.  Southern Cal should demonstrate the courage of its athletes’ convictions.
He didn’t commit his crimes until well after he was done playing football. Your take on the subject is a waste of time and completely fake. There is no credible reason why you would be offended by a statue that had nothing to do with any crime. Your trying to convince the world how fantastic and sensitive you are.
Precisely! Well said, Rich S.! Why is Mr. Nourian so offended by this statue?!
No they shouldn’t
No they shouldn’t
Must be a bunch of LIBTARDS wanting to rewrite history.  It was horrible what oj did but he won the trophy 20 years earlier.  Kinda like Manning ya know libtards?
This has nothing to do liberalism or conservatism, you wiener. But, yes, what he did in 1994 has nothing to do with what he did 20 years earlier on the football field.
True that
Wiener?  Might want to be kearfull what ya call peeps!
I’m triggered and offended! LOL!
Your statement of his playing days being almost a half century behind us just supports the fact that what he did on the field is totally separate from his horrible crimes later in his life. Not to mention the fact that he had a long career with the Bills in the NFL after USC. Are you asking the Buffalo Bills to totally abandon their history with OJ as well?
What Joe Paterno did happened while he was directly involved in football as well as Reggie Bush (NCAA legal atrocities left for another conversation) Very different situations from OJ’s. 
Agree with you but suspect you do not agree with the Bush inclusion. I would say that what Bush accomplished on the field was spectacular and few would argue. I think the athletic feat should remain a landmark for what it is. But of course I also think keeping the all time hit leader out of the baseball HOF is just as absurd.
Sure, Bush’s accomplishment was spectacular.  But, as it turns out, he was ineligible to play during his entire spectacular season, so the Heisman committee had a valid reason for asking for it’s trophy back.  
And even if the NCAA had not forced the University to disassociate itself from Bush, the University would have had a valid basis for doing so on its own.  Bush’s behavior represented a betrayal of USC on every level – university, students, and especially, teammates.
More revisionist history at work.  Please point me to a link…any link, where the Heisman Trust actually asked for the Trophy to be returned.  Don’t waste your time because it never happened.
Perhaps because Bush returned his trophy before they did.  Given his behavior throughout the whole affair, it’s hard to imagine that he returned it unbidden from a sense of his own shame.
So what’s your point, Bozo?  You think catching a technicality somehow makes Bush look better?  Every one of his team’s wins was vacated because the actions he and his family took rendered him ineligible.
Historical fact is that OJ was the best in college football that year. Also factual that over 30 years later, he committed a double murder and 10 years after that, armed robbery. I have no problem accepting both sets of fact and believe that trying to expunge the early years because of what would later occur is a feeble effort deal with an uncomfortable life paradox. Reality can be messy, but it is what it is. The Heisman is for achievement on the field and his prowess that year is undeniable. I think both Bush and Simpson trophies should sit among the others. They were both earned.
Agreed.. His “collegiate playing days are nearly a half-century behind him”. Appreciate what he did on the field, which happened well before any of his heinous crimes.
Uh, OJ was found NOT guilty of a double murder. That is factual. You may speculate that he did it, but that is your opinion. Hope I didn’t ruin the ending of the TV series for you.

The Trojans split a pair of midweek games on Tuesday and Wednesday, defeating Loyola Marymount 4-3 but being shut out 5-0 in an exhibition game by NC Dinos. 
On Wednesday, the incredibly loud and energetic Dinos fans danced, sang and chanted words of encouragement in their native Korean to the Dinos,  who outhit the Trojans 6-4. The Dinos were led by two home runs from former MLB player Eric Thames. 
The loss came a day after the Trojans defeated LMU for their first road victory of the season, where freshman Pitcher CJ Stubbs recorded his first collegiate win Tuesday as USC baseball escaped a 2-run ninth inning scare. 
Stubb shined in his six-inning USC debut, allowing one run on four hits and a strikeout. Head coach Dan Hubbs credited Stubbs’ ability to move to the ball in and out of the strike zone, which enabled him to get weak contact so that his defense can make a play. 
“For a freshman to come out in his outing and do that was big because winning is hard to do and there is so much parity in the game that you have to play extremely well,” Hubbs said, “That was big and great to see.” 
Sophomore infielder Frankie Rios’ turned a game-ending double play that sealed the game for the Trojans, who had been leading the contest 4-1 until the bottom of the ninth when senior reliever Marc Huberman allowed two runs on two hits with two walks. He was replaced by junior Jeff Pachke, who allowed one hit, loaded the bases and escaped by forcing LMU sophomore Jamey Smart to hit into a double play. 
Sophomore Adalberto Carrillo gave the Trojans the initial lead in the third inning with his first hit of the season, a solo home run, but LMU infielder Ted Boeke tied the game with a solo home run of his own in the fourth inning. Later in that inning, USC retook the lead when sophomore Angelo Armenta utilized a sacrifice fly to make it 2-1. 
“We have got to get a big hit on that situation where we can put up a crooked number and really start to separate a game,” Hubbs said, “Because we have played four one-run games in four games now, but I think we will be better for it in the long run.” 
Senior Timmy Robinson, whose first hit of the season was a walk-off single against North Dakota in USC’s last game, continued to make an impact despite battling elbow tightness with a two-run homer in the sixth inning to give the Trojans a 4-1 cushion heading into the bottom of the ninth. 
Next up, the Trojans return to their regular season schedule, facing Wake Forest at home on Friday night to kick off a three-game set.

The men’s volleyball team fell at No. 8 UCSB in straight sets (19-25, 19-25, 21-25).
USC (3-12, 3-10 MPSF) entered tonight coming off a big five-set upset versus No. 5 Hawaii, but after an eight day lay-off, the Trojans came out of the gates flat, falling behind 2-0.
On the other side of the net, UCSB (12-6, 8-5 MPSF) came ready to play. Redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson propelled the Gauchos to the early lead with 15 kills and a .652 hitting percentage. Redshirt senior outside hitter Austin Kingi added seven more kills and hit .385. The Gauchos as a team hit .436 though the first two sets and .317 for the match.
The Trojans had no answer to the Gaucho attack as their season-long blocking struggles continued. The team recorded only four blocks through the first two sets and added one more in an error-ridden third. USC also struggled attacking throughout the match, recording a meager 31 kills and 18 errors on 89 attempts — a .146 hitting percentage.
In the third set, the Trojans looked more competitive as they traded off points with the Gauchos, but service errors cost them the match. Three early service errors prevented the Trojans from running away with the set, but they still had control with a 15-13 lead. However, a fourth service error off the hands of senior outside hitter Alex Slaught turned the moment to the Gauchos who would win five consecutive points through a USC timeout to take an 18-15 lead. 
Coach Jeff Nygaard tried to stop the bleeding with a second timeout and subbed in freshman opposite Ryan Moss. Moss recorded a quick kill, but three more service errors effectively killed the Trojans’ chances at a comeback.
The Gauchos did not play their best in that set either as they hit only marginally better at a mark of .074. That said, they recorded three blocks and stymied USC’s offense.
It was an ugly set to watch that ended a season sweep for the Gauchos over the Trojans. 
With nine games left in MPSF play, the two teams are in very different positions. The Gauchos are sitting near the top of the league with an almost surefire chance at making the playoffs. Their focus will be on making late season improvements to make a run for the NCAA tournament. 
Meanwhile the Trojans will have to give it their all to make the MPSF playoffs in coach Nygaard’s first year at the helm.

After a difficult loss to the top-ranked Cal Golden Bears, the women’s tennis team is heading across town to Westwood to take on the UCLA Bruins at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday in their last match before official Pac-12 play begins. 
Both teams are looking to rebound after losses to Cal, with the Bruins falling to them 5-2 on Saturday after the Trojans lost 6-1 on Friday.
The two teams finished in the top three in the conference last year, splitting two exciting matches with the score of 4-3, with the home team winning each time. 
This matchup will be quite different from last year’s first meeting between the teams, where USC came in on a roll ranked 3rd in the country and UCLA pulled the upset ranked 11th. 
After a challenging season, the Women of Troy are trying to battle back to the top of the rankings, currently sitting at 38th; UCLA has a similar mindset, ranked at 29th, and both teams have three losses on the year.
The match will get off to an exciting start in the doubles play, with both teams featuring top 10 doubles teams. Bruins seniors Catherine Harrison and Kyle McPhillips and the Trojans eighth-ranked pair, senior Giuliana Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith. 
The Trojans’ deep doubles lineup also includes a teams of freshman Jessica Failla and junior Zoë Katz, as well as sophomore Madison Westby and freshman Rianna Valdes.
Westby knows a thing or two about beating the Bruins, winning both her singles matches against UCLA last season.
“UCLA is always a good match,” Westby said. “They’re a good time, and so are we, so hopefully we pull it out.”
Westby is one of five Trojans who are ranked in singles, listed at 85th in this week’s rankings. 
Joining her are the two freshman Valdes and Failla at 60th and 66th, respectively, and sophomore Gabby Smith at 90th. 
Olmos rounds out the impressive list of ranked Trojans at 21st, but will likely face a difficult challenge against the Bruin’s 19th ranked senior Catherine Harrison. 
UCLA does not have any other ranked players, but in a rivalry match, will always bring a serious challenge across the board. 
The Bruin women bring more experience to the table with three of their top six players being seniors, leading to an intriguing matchup between the talented young Trojans and the veteran Bruins.
Katz and sophomore Meredith Xepoleas round out the singles players for the Trojans, both coming in with plenty of experience both in matches this season and previous years.
“There’s some excitement that goes into playing your conference that’s more school-oriented,” Katz said about the non-conference UCLA match and official Pac-12 play that starts next week.
USC will once again bring in strong preparation to the important and challenging part of the schedule that begins Thursday.

Women’s and men’s head water polo coach Jovan Vavic has announced that long-time assistant Marko Pintaric will join him at the helm of the men’s program as co-head coach. 
Pintaric was previously the associate head coach for the men’s program as well as scouting director for the women’s side of the program. He will retain his position for the Women of Troy while moving up for the men. 
Pintaric has been a coach for USC for 15 years, all serving under his former coach, Vavic. 
“Pinta has been an integral part of our program as a player and now as a coach,” Vavic said in a press release. “He has developed some of the best goalies in NCAA history, and his energy, knowledge and innovative mind has brought a great deal of excitement to our team.” 
As a coach, Pintaric has been a part of eight men’s national championships as well as three national championships on the women’s side. Pintaric has specialized in goalie development, having coached four Trojans who represented their respective nations in goals during the 2012 Olympics. 
As a player, he was a two-year starter in 1997 and 1998. Pintaric was a pivotal player during the 1998 national championship run, scoring 44 goals that season. That year, Pintaric was also awarded National Player of the Year and was a first team All-American. 
Outside of USC, Pintaric has also joined Vavic as an interim coach for the men’s national team, leading the team to World Championship qualification at the 2013 World Aquatic Championship Qualification Tournament. 
The Croatian native graduated with a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in communications at USC. 
“Pinta is loyal, committed, hard-working and an unselfish young coach,” Vavic said. ”USC water polo would never be what it is today without Pinta’s great contributions. I am thrilled that he has accepted this new position and am looking forward to many more great years together.” 
The Men of Troy are coming off a season in which they fell to UCLA in the NCAA Championship game.
