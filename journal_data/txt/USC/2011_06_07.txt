There are bound to be fans of the X-Men saga who will be pleased with last weekend’s long-awaited prequel, X-Men: First Class. Although the film does breathe some new life into the sagging franchise, it’s emphatically not the fantastic film it could have been, and it most likely won’t age particularly well. Unimaginative dialogue, a subpar musical score, rushed character development and a perplexing — if not downright unnecessary — historical backdrop are among the numerous elements holding it back.

First Class tells multiple stories, including the formation of the team of mutants which will later be known as the X-Men and the burgeoning friendship between future enemies Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). The supernaturally powerful pair work together to fight Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), a mutant with the power to absorb and wield kinetic energy, bent on taking over the world. All of this takes place during the 1960s with a Cold War backdrop.
The film is hardly a notch above average, owing its strengths to specific moments as opposed to the film as a whole. Most of the fight scenes are highly entertaining, mainly because of the villainous henchmen unleashing their powers. There are also a handful of comedic moments, but aside from a hilarious cameo, nothing is too memorable. The pace of the plot is decent, although it suffers early on from quick and numerous scene jumps.
One of the strongest aspects of the film is the exploration of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto. Xavier helps Magneto realize his true potential in his control of metal, and despite their different personalities, they work well together. Yet it’s clear to viewers their friendship is doomed because of their oil-and-water ideologies. The original movies gave the impression that Xavier and Magneto had been friends for many years, not for the short period of time suggested by First Class.
As for the primary villain, Sebastian Shaw easily has one of the most impressive and dangerous powers. But he seems content spending most of the film lounging around in tuxedos and summer whites in extravagant rooms sipping champagne. Shaw is somewhat flat and generically evil for a villain and for most of the film it seems as though he is on autopilot. If he were a bit more self-motivated, Shaw could have easily achieved world domination in minutes.
The most fascinating aspect of the film is seeing how old characters are interpreted and re-imagined. Xavier is believable as an easy-going, arrogant, and naively optimistic young man who is fond of the word “groovy” — unfortunately, the use of that word is one of the only hints that the film is set in the ’60s. Mystique’s (Jennifer Lawrence) inner conflict and insecurity over her blue, scaly mutant form and Magneto’s confidence and adamant opposition to “hiding” help explain their future relationship.
Fassbender steals the show as a young Magneto. Charismatic, athletic and reminiscent of James Bond, he is absolutely mesmerizing. He is a conflicted, well-rounded character and contains the seeds of wisdom his older self possesses in the original films. He is haunted by his childhood experience in a concentration camp during the Holocaust and is consumed by the need to protect mutants from a similar fate as well as the desire for revenge. He even spends an early part of the movie hunting down former Nazis.
In fact, First Class would have been better off had it solely concerned itself with Magneto’s personal journey and experiences. Instead, the Cuban Missile Crisis comes to the forefront of the film during the climatic battle, and it is exasperatingly needless.  Anyone who has opened a U.S. history book and paid attention knows how the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and since First Class is not a creation of Quentin Tarantino’s personal brand of history rewriting (see Inglourious Basterds), the Cuban Missile Crisis is a silly and predictable plot device.
Another one of the film’s major flaws is the musical score by Henry Pryce Jackman. Despite his work on numerous films, in First Class he comes off as an amateur with a personal grudge against subtlety. The music is often loud, overdramatic and it overpowers whatever is happening in the scene instead of letting the story speak for itself.
It’s hard to be overly harsh in critcizing First Class. It is what it is — a summer action popcorn flick. It could have been something great,but ends up being not bad. The possibility of a sequel is intriguing; there is plenty of room for improvement and First Class has just enough of a solid foundation for the writers and director to build upon successfully. Though the film failed to capture any genuine essence of the ’60s, suffered from a bombastic, distracting musical score, subpar dialogue and bad historical backdrop, it’s paced well, contains a host of mutants with interesting powers and has just enough awesome Fassbender scenes to make it worth seeing in theaters.
This deserves more that 2 stars..it went back to basics with this film about oppression, marginalization and equal rights + action.  great acting too!

J.J. Abrams keeps on coming back to a box he received in his childhood.
As a boy, Abrams was given a ‘mystery box’ — unknown items inside a box labeled only with a question mark. Abrams, now nearly 45, has never opened it, but has said the box’s tug on his imagination greatly influences his work to this day.
Keep rolling · A handful of young movie buffs stumble on the footage of a lifetime when an unbelievable disaster happens in view of their camera while shooting a submission for a film contest in small-town Ohio. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures 
Super 8, Abrams’ latest, is no exception. Marketed as mysteriously as any of his past works — television series Lost and Cloverfield (2008) included — Abrams’ first turn as writer, director and producer of a feature film presents audiences with a mystery box of their own.
When ‘opened,’ Super 8 proves a flawed but spectacular collection of nostalgia, mystery, humor, emotion, legitimate horror and, most importantly, a type of blockbuster filmmaking not often seen in today’s box office-driven movie landscape.
Abrams, aided by the production of Steven Spielberg, tells the story of intrepid middle-school filmmakers bent on the highest possible production value for their submission to a local movie contest in 1979 middle America.
Charles and Joe (newcomers Riley Griffiths and Joel Courtney, who are themselves fantastically cast in Super 8) are after the perfect cast and location for a CBS Radio Mystery Theater-inspired zombie flick. After convincing Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) to play the female lead and provide a mode of transportation to the all-important train station set, the duo and its ragtag group of friends (all of whom turn in unexpectedly good performances) are ready to put together the romantic climax of their short at the station.
It’s then, in a scene that both literally and figuratively screams “production value!” that Super 8 presents the contents of its mystery box to audiences as well as the unsuspecting population of small town Lillian, Ohio.
The Lillian community that emerges post-incident epitomizes the Cold War-inspired fear that engulfed the nation during that time — an achievement with Spielberg’s nostalgic fingerprints all over it — and perfectly captures the family dynamic and cultural feel of the latter part of that decade.
The expected government secrecy plotline interferes with Joe’s father, local deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler), and his investigation into what exactly happened, only pushing viewers further onto the edge of their seats.
What follows is an homage to the monster and alien flicks that obviously influenced Abrams as a film-obsessed kid, from the darkness in Jaws to the wonderment and emotion in E.T.
The audience doesn’t get a look at what emerges from the box until well into the second half of the film, but the fear is palpable nonetheless, a testament to Abrams’ ability behind the camera.

A standout scene at a gas station involving the sheriff on the outskirts of town shows just what the film achieves. The audience never gets a good look at any of the “action,” but it knows exactly what happened.
The easy comparison here would be to Cloverfield, where Abrams used a shaky cam approach to convince the audience they were seeing a mystery unfold in real time. Abrams instead makes the decision here — and the correct one at that — to present a movie that looks like it was made today, but feels like it was made in 1979.
And unlike Cloverfield, which desperately tried to connect to its audience by splicing a lost-love narrative into the first-person footage, Super 8’s emotional hook — the telegraphed Joe-Alice love connection in the face of emotional turmoil and feuding parents — works on a variety of levels, to the point where the mystery becomes of secondary concern to the audience.
Unfortunately, as the movie comes to a close, Super 8 loses its footing in its attempt to close these two storylines. Wrapping things up has never really been Abrams’ strong suit, and the clichéd and forced ending to the mystery plotline does leave something to be desired.
But the emotion does stick with you. Abrams’ directing coupled with work from some old standbys — Larry Fong’s (Lost) cinematography and Michael Giacchino’s (Lost, Star Trek) original score — does enough to render Abrams’ underwhelming wrap-up writing forgivable and will leave most satisfied.
If he were to ever open his own mystery box, Abrams would forever limit the infinite possibilities of his most talked-about possession. In Super 8, Abrams might have slipped by opening the film’s box too early, diminishing the infinite possibility to a decidedly less intriguing completion a bit too soon, flaming out just before the finish line. But on the way there, Abrams managed to create a film well worth a place beside those it so openly hopes to honor.

In what might be the finest instance of audience targeting ever orchestrated, MTV debuted its new supernatural thriller Teen Wolf Sunday night, immediately following the conclusion of the network’s two-hour Movie Awards telecast.
Lone wolf · Scott McCall (Tyler Posey) must confront his newfound identity as a werewolf all while dealing with school, girls and lacrosse. - Photo courtesy of MTV 
After the 120-minute Twilight lovefest ran its course (the stars of Eclipse, the latest installment in the still-unfolding franchise, accepted awards for best male performance, best female performance, best fight, best kiss and best movie), those who were still tuned in were precisely the demographic that would be interested in the fare MTV would be serving up in Teen Wolf: high school social struggles (drama!) compounded by pesky supernatural complications (super-drama!).
With all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, MTV actively sought to remind audiences tuning in for the Movie Awards, “Yes, you do love Twilight, and are both open to and eager for a television show in the same vein that just might be able to tide you over until the November release of Breaking Dawn.”
Specifically, they were being primed to welcome yet another shape-shifting Adonis into their living rooms and lives, this time the relatively fresh-faced Tyler Posey.
Teen Wolf’s shaky pilot finds 16-year-old Scott McCall (Posey) poised to enter his sophomore year of high school in the fictional town of Beacon Hills, Calif. Scott has big hopes for the coming school year, not the least important of which involves earning a starting position on the school’s championship lacrosse team.
Scott’s plans for a good night’s rest in preparation for lacrosse tryouts and the first day back at school are derailed, however, when his best friend and fellow nobody Stiles’ (Dylan O’Brien) vaguely troubling penchant for eavesdropping on his policeman father’s phone calls and radio dispatches sends the pair into the woods on a morbid goose chase to search for the other half of a dead girl whose body recently turned up.
Predictably, the two end up getting separated, and an animal attack from which Scott emerges alive but not unscathed leaves Scott feeling not quite himself the next day. Supersonic hearing and superhuman athleticism — to say nothing of an uncannily brief recovery time on a wound that was gaping the night before and gone by the next day — might be a source of confusion, but also prove to be wellspring of good fortune, too. An out-of-nowhere stellar showing on the lacrosse pitch garners Scott the unprecedented attention of his coach and the vengeful ire of the threatened big man on campus Jackson Whittemore (Colton Haynes), and his newly bolstered powers of hearing allow him to capitalize on conversational footholds with the beautiful new girl in town, Allison Argent (Crystal Reed).
Someone’s patently discourteous decision to host a big party on the night of the full moon causes all type of problems, and an enamored Allison is oblivious to the fact that she might have some conflicting loyalties — namely, to a hunter and his prey.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Teen Wolf’s pilot doesn’t reflect the art of screenwriting at its finest; the bulk of the writerly energies expended in creating this inaugural episode seem to have been directed toward mapping out a story that bounces from one scene showcasing Posey’s bare chest to the next as many times as possible in 41 minutes. The requisite lines of exposition were painful but mercifully brief, and if nothing else, a number of revelations and realizations that could have just as easily been scattered throughout the first three or four episodes were consolidated into the pilot — a detail that bodes well for the pacing of future episodes. In truth, there really wouldn’t be any point protracting Scott’s realization that he had been bitten by a werewolf and was now, in fact, one himself — audiences could gather as much from the title of the show.
Little about Teen Wolf could be considered innovative: The title is borrowed from a 1985 Michael J. Fox vehicle, its very existence is owed to the lingering trendiness of the sexy monster genre (True Blood, Twilight, The Vampire Diaries), and the show is giving no indication it will be contributing anything new to the vast body of existing werewolf lore. Though you’ll most often hear her assertion that vampires in direct sunlight don’t burn, but sparkle, being made the butt of jokes, at least Stephenie Meyer added something to the centuries-old accumulation of supernatural mythology — Teen Wolf doesn’t appear to have anything new to say whatsoever.
Despite having to contend with a less-than-nuanced script, interactions between the young residents of Beacon Hills ring pleasantly of authenticity. Stiles’ sarcasm and self-assured nerdiness meshes perfectly with Scott’s frequent exasperation and initial awkwardness — the friendly dynamic reads more realistically than most everything else on the show, actually. Holland Roden’s Lydia and Colton Haynes’ Jackson, the ‘it’ couple pairing of the brainy hot girl and the top jock with all-American good looks, come across as stereotypes, but if they’re going to be stock characters, at least they’re competently recreated.
Teen Wolf suffers from misplaced efforts. Much more time appears to have been invested in honing Tyler Posey’s lacrosse skills than in drafting lines suited for a budding teenage romance for instance. More hours were doubtless spent sculpting the young actor’s lean, chiseled build than rehearsing plausible human reactions (not every development requires an impression of Macaulay Culkin’s Home Alone face).
But now the scene has been set, the characters introduced, the world established and the supernatural drama set in motion. What was an indisputably rough pilot just might have cleared a path to move forward and pursue a story.
this show is my new favorite…great article

It’s not often in college sports that a team gets to return to the scene of its greatest failure for a shot at redemption.
But that’s exactly the opportunity the No. 17 USC men’s golf team got this week at the NCAA championship at Karsten Creek Golf Club in Stillwater, Okla.
The Trojans placed last in a field of 15 at the same course in September, finishing 70 strokes out of the lead at the Ping/Golfweek Preview.

USC’s performance this week, while much improved, left the team six shots short of qualifying for the match play portion of the tournament and ended its season with a tie for 12th at 31-over-par (303-289-303).
“It was a super challenging golf course,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “They put a huge premium on driving the ball in the fairways. It was something we knew we had to work on throughout the year. We didn’t accomplish what we wanted to accomplish, which certainly was to get to the match play.”
No. 8 Augusta State claimed its second straight national championship by defeating in-state rival No. 14 Georgia 3-2 in the match play final. LSU’s John Peterson won the individual title with a 5-under-par week.
The Trojans’ improved play at Karsten Creek demonstrated their growth over the season. After failing to post a top-three finish in the year’s first six events, USC finished in the top-three in all five of its tournaments leading up the national championship. The Trojans also captured the program’s first Pac-10 team title since 2007.
“We had that Pac-10 victory and we’ve been playing absolutely solid golf for the last three months,” junior Steve Lim said.
Freshman Jeffrey Kang led the Trojans on the week with a tie for 20th individually, posting rounds of 72-73-75 to finish at 4-over-par for the tournament.
“He did most everything pretty well,” Zambri said. “He bogeyed the last two holes or he could have had a top-15 finish, which would have been pretty special for a first year kid. But in the end he had a great performance for us.”
Lim, the team’s most experienced player, recovered from a disappointing opening round 78 to post 72-75 and finish in a tie for 56th at 9-over-par.
“It was championship time: You have to play well, but I wasn’t able to do it,” Lim said. “I actually played quite well the last two rounds. I turned my game around, but a little too late after a bad start.”
Pac-10 individual champion, sophomore Martin Trainer, had posted four straight top-seven finishes coming into the event. He struggled in Oklahoma, however, shooting 75-75-76 and tying for 66th at 10-over-par.
“I didn’t really play well the entire tournament to tell you the truth,” Trainer said. “I kind of struggled a lot with my ball striking. It was just a tough, tough course and we really needed to play well to make it and we just didn’t get it done.”
Sophomore T.J. Vogel, a freshman All-American a season ago, finished a disappointing year with his worst score of the campaign — a final round 82 that included nine bogeys and two double bogeys. His total of 17-over-par (78-73 in the opening two rounds) earned him a tie for 113th.
“I know he’s going to turn it around,” Zambri said about Vogel’s prospects for next season.
Sophomore Sam Smith was disqualified from individual contention after signing for an incorrect score after his first round. His second round 71 was a big part of USC’s turnaround day, but he could only muster a 77 in the final round.
After the tournament, Zambri and his players decided to focus on the team’s progress over the last three months and what promises to be an exciting 2011-2012 season.
The incoming freshman — top-ranked junior golfer Anthony Paolucci and Daniel Lee — will add depth to the squad, while the returning Trojans have committed to a strenuous summer schedule of amateur golf events.
“I feel like we’re going to be great next year,” Zambri said. “It’s not just that we’ve got five kids coming back that were starters, but some of them are playing the best golf they’ve ever played and really turned a big corner within the last couple months. If you throw in our two incoming freshman, one of which is the No. 1 player in the country, I think we’re going to have a fabulous year.”

A quick glance at USC baseball’s record would tell you it was a difficult season, but to just look at the numbers wouldn’t be fair.
The Trojans were picked to finish ninth in the Pac-10, without a full-time coach, and fresh off a last-place finish in the conference.
But the team finished seventh, the program’s best since 2006. Frank Cruz was appointed full-time coach May 19, and the Trojans dealt with their schedule valiantly, taking series from then-No. 11 Stanford, then-No. 6 Arizona State and then-No. 2 Oregon State , as well as knocking off then-No. 13 UCLA at Dodger Stadium.
Top talent · USC first baseman Ricky Oropesa, who led USC in the triple crown categories, was drafted 116th overall by the San Francisco Giants. - Summer Trojan file photo 
“We made a lot of strides this year,” Cruz said. “The guys got a lot more comfortable with me and visa-versa.”
At nearly every position, the Trojans had players step up offensively and defensively. Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa showed he was a worthy preseason All-American, leading the team in batting average (.322), RBI (44) and extra-base hits (18), among others. Senior second baseman Joe De Pinto hit .300 for the year and led the team in on-base percentage and steals. In addition to his reliability behind the plate, junior catcher Kevin Roundtree also hit leadoff for the Trojans and led the team in runs scored.
Following Oropesa’s move from first to third, sophomore infielder Adam Landecker was called upon to fill the void at first base. Landecker had a breakout season, hitting .280, committing just three errors on the year.
Junior Matt Foat proved more than capable in left field and Alex Sherrod shined in right field. The junior led the team in slugging at .486, and was second in almost every other stat category behind.
But perhaps no position player was as impressive as James Roberts. As a true freshman, Roberts started every single game at the most important defensive position — shortstop.
“At the start of the season, we thought [Roberts] would pitch a bit for us,” Cruz said. “But he was so impressive at short, we just couldn’t move him.”
But the uncertainty surrounding the Trojans position players was nothing compared to their pitching staff, but despite this each of USC’s three starters more than earned their spots.
Junior Andrew Triggs returned as the Trojans top starter, finishing with a 3.67 ERA and led the team with 72 strikeouts. Triggs was especially brilliant down the stretch, going 3-1 with a 1.66 ERA in his final six games.
Austin Wood finished the season with a 5.61 ERA and 34 walks to his 50 strikeouts. But the junior flashed brilliance, including going eight strong innings against then-No. 11 Stanford and then-No. 2 Oregon State.
Senior Logan Odom was the most consistent starter, ending the season with a 3.96 ERA.
But for all the strides the team made this year, they might have lost many key players to the draft. Oropesa was selected in the third round by the San Franciso Giants, Odom was selected in the eighth round by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Wood was selected in the sixth round by the Angels, junior pitcher Chad Smith was selected in the seventh round by the Minnesota Twins and DePinto was selected in the 21st round by the Chicago White Sox. The success of players like Sherrod, Roundtree and Triggs this year could cost the Trojans in the draft, too.
But Cruz’s focus is undeterred by what the draft could do to his present — or future — team.
“Bottom line is at a program like USC, you expect to be playing in the postseason every year,” Cruz said. “And it’s disappointing we’re not right now.”
The writer must not have seen any games this year. Oropesa moved back to first base and Landecker was the third baseman latter part of the season. Two of the drafted players were seniors, Odom and DePinto. Chad Smith had TJ surgery will miss next season in college or pro ball. Sherrod and Roundtree not drafted in the 30 rounds so going nowhere. The article omits the 31 losses which came about some how with all this talent described above. Middle relief was atrocious along with most mid-week games costing a trip to the regionals. Please explain the last two home losses to WSU by a combined 23 to 3 score?

The Bowl Championship Series stripped USC of its 2004 national championship Monday as a result of major infractions stemming from the ineligibility of former tailback Reggie Bush.
Punished · Less than two weeks after the NCAA denied USC’s appeal, the BCS took away the Trojans’ 2004 national championship. - Summer Trojan file photo 
As a result of the ruling, USC must vacate the results of the 2005 Orange Bowl, the 2004 national title game in which USC defeated Oklahoma 55-19, as well as the 2006 Rose Bowl, in which the Trojans lost to Texas 41-38 in the final minutes.
“The BCS alerted us today that their presidents have voted to vacate USC’s 2005 BCS Championship Game victory,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said in a statement. “This was not an unexpected outcome. We will comply with all requirements mandated by the result of this BCS vote.”
The announcement comes 11 days after USC’s appeal of last June’s sanctions, which included a two-year postseason ban and a loss of 30 scholarships over three seasons, was denied by the NCAA’s Infractions Appeals Committee.
The BCS was only waiting for the appeals process to be completed, before making its ruling official.
“The BCS arrangement crowns a national champion, and the BCS games are showcase events for postseason football,” BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock said in a statement. “One of the best ways of ensuring that they remain so is for us to foster full compliance with NCAA rules. Accordingly, in keeping with the NCAA’s recent action, USC’s appearances are being vacated.”
As a result, there will no BCS champion for the 2004-2005 season.
“This action reflects the scope of the BCS arrangement and is consistent with the NCAA’s approach when it subsequently discovers infractions by institutions whose teams have played in NCAA championship events,” Hancock said.
USC will still keep its Associated Press National Championship.
Suck it up and move on. The NC2 doesn’t want to see a West Coast school dominate in D1 football. When Trojans manhandle SEC teams, they get flustered and embarrassed. I was proudly wearing my SC baseball cap at the UT Austin campus last week, because I had to visit my girlfriend there. I was laughing at all the dirty stares I received. I was like “giyeah, bring on the hatuhs!”
There are so many Lawyers around USC, in fact Pat Haden is one!! What ever happened to “FIGHT ON”?????
They can take away anything they want to, but, as everyone knows, those games and Titles were won by the Trojans on the Field of Play, and the memories cannot be taken away, ever!! 
All the Major Conferences should band together and form a new Governing Body & get rid of the Pompous Idiots in NCAA. We volunteer to participate in this Crooked, Monopolistic Program that makes up the rules as it goes, to serve itself. 
Life is too short to put u with incompetence.
What a bunch of cheaters. I don’t know how anyone could still praise the accomplishments of this skewed and greedy program. It will not be so easy for USC to win games at all, left alone championships, now that they can no longer pay their players. 20-16
Still the only National Champions that year! kept the AP. BCS doesnt want USC to play in the BCS champ game anyway…they effectivley kept us completely out of it in 2003, so they were forced by outcry to let us in the next two years. now they get to do what they wanted to do in the first place, keep USC out of range of their beloved SEC teams.
The man responsible for all this owes the University an apology. We as students, alumni, faculty were humiliated this week by being the first football program in the country stripped of a national championship. 
What this man failed to realize is that he represented an intuition and tradition that is much more bigger and precious that any-one athlete. It is an honor and privilege to wear the cardinal & gold! And this man’s unscrupulous behavior has tarnish our football program. 
I hope Pat Haden unretires #5 from the rest of the Trojan legends.
FIGHT ON TROJANS!!
Go ahead and take the trophy and erase the stats from the record books, but you can’t take away the great memories.  Our guys won that game on the field where it truly counts and Choklahoma knows it.
Bull!

Junior Steve Johnson has accomplished what very few have been able to do. With strong play  and impeccable will and stamina, he walked away victorious from the NCAA singles championship match in Palo Alto, Calif., just a week after he led the Trojans to the NCAA team title.
Johnson’s achievements could not have come at a more appropriate time. Although grand on its own, the dual-championship serves as a sign for better things to come for a university still embroiled in controversy.
After a four-year NCAA investigation involving former Heisman Trophy-winner Reggie Bush, the NCAA rejected USC’s appeal to reduce sanctions imposed on the school’s football program.
In the wake of the NCAA’s wrath, Johnson and the USC men’s tennis team established a new dynasty.
With a reformed athletic administration, fresh faces in the big-ticket sports and a refreshed approach to compliance, USC athletics as a whole will be able to look to the accomplishments of their men’s tennis team for inspiration and guidance.
Merely half a week after the ruling was handed down, Johnson walked out of Stanford’s Taube Tennis Stadium as the nation’s champion after a tough three-set match. As one of USC’s most lauded programs took a shot to the chin, another emerged victorious in spectacular fashion.
With the darkness of the NCAA’s victimization of Troy came the light of Johnson’s unprecedented victories. Johnson and the USC men’s tennis program’s dominance demonstrates USC’s athletic greatness can be found in venues outside of the gridiron.
Johnson’s individual championship caps a historic feat. It was the first time a Trojan has won both the singles championship and the team championship in the same season since 1977, when the NCAA re-tooled the tournament to a dual-match format.
His accomplishments speak to the work of a group of dedicated student-athletes and coaching staff.
With this in mind, Johnson was accompanied by a team stockpiled with talent that can continue the program’s success into the future.
Junior Daniel Nguyen was the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player last season. This year, he scored the team championship clincher for the second year in a row. Nguyen will be returning for his senior season to help lead the charge to a fourth consecutive NCAA title.
Sophomore J.T. Sundling and freshman Ray Sarmiento also played pivotal roles in doubles matches throughout the NCAA tournament.
With their success up to this point and a few years ahead between them and their departures, the two are primed to follow Nguyen and Johnson’s examples and lead the program in the future.
But what about Johnson?
With the individual championship in hand alongside three team championships, it seems as though another year roaming the University Park Campus would be an afterthought.
After winning the singles championship, Johnson received an automatic bid to test his pro-ready skills in the US Open this August.
Luckily for USC fans, this event will not be Johnson’s transitional step to the professional circuit.
Deciding to return to USC for his senior season gives him and the Trojans the opportunity to accomplish a feat only two other teams have in NCAA men’s tennis’ 128-year history.
If USC brings home another team title in 2012, they will be the third team in NCAA history to win four consecutive national championships.
The others were Stanford (1995-1998) and another USC squad, under the guidance of former coach George Toley from 1966 to 1969.
All in all, USC fans will be able to cheer for a dynasty-in-the-making in 2012 while also supporting Johnson in his quest to win a second straight individual title.
At a time when the football program is down, the men’s tennis program is quietly on the rise.
With the Trojans’ 20th national championship ripe for the taking in 2012, with a three-peat reclaiming a dynasty (that was temporarily held by a Pac-10 rival) and a full-fledged superstar leading the charge, Troy’s athletics will continue to shine in the new era.
 
“Between The Lines” runs every other Wednesday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Duke at dukeho@usc.edu.
 
Yea! Steve good job!  Keep up the good work we are so proud of you!
Congratulations, Steve.  You are the epitome of Trojan values. Fight on!

1976 and 2001.
These are two very important years to the USC track and field team. They mark the years when the men’s and women’s teams, respectively, last won an NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship.
Cremé of the crop · Junior captain Joey Hughes (far right) has developed into one of the top 400m runners in the country, and his time of 45.15 sec ranks seventh all-time in USC history. This week, he will be competing in the 400m race and the 4x400m race. - Summer Trojan file photo 
Entering this year’s competition, the men’s team ranks No. 6 in the nation and the women’s team comes in at No. 7.
Both teams are primed to make some noise at the NCAAs as USC will look to use its 19 qualifying athletes to conquer 15 different events throughout the course of the competition.
With the events taking place at historic Drake Stadium in Des Moines, Iowa, the team hopes for the best in continuing its legacy.
Yes, a legacy.
Even though it has been quite some time since the USC men’s and women’s teams, took home the national title, that doesn’t mean the Trojans haven’t seen overall success.
The men’s team has won the most NCAA outdoor titles — 26 in total — which is more than double the next-best program in Arkansas.
As for the women’s team, its only title was in 2001. Regardless, USC as a whole has constantly appeared in the top-10 at the NCAA championships.
Junior captain Joey Hughes expressed his optimism, especially in terms of the men’s team, for this year’s competition.
“I have confidence in our team,” Hughes said. “I feel like we will do excellent. We have a strong group of guys and we will do good overall for the men’s side.”
One of the fastest 400-meter runners in the country, Hughes will be a big asset to the team at the NCAA championships. He will also participate in the 4×400-meter relay with junior Duane Walker, sophomore Reggie Wyatt and freshman Josh Mance — one of the fastest relay teams in the country.
The young USC team, which heads to Des Moines with only four seniors, has done a few things to prepare for competition.
“One thing that we did versus the other teams is that we got here a few days earlier,” Hughes said. “We will be used to the time zone, we won’t feel like we just flew in and feel uncomfortable. And we had lighter practices before this so we wouldn’t be tired.”
Even though they are scarce in number, two of four USC’s seniors will be a force to reckon with.
Seniors Oscar Spurlock and Brendan Ames are ranked third and fourth in the nation, respectively, in the 110-meter hurdles.
As for the team’s biggest strength, the junior captain named three key areas, in addition to hurdles, where the Trojans excel.
“Our strength is in the hurdles, 400 and the throws,” Hughes said. “We have two strong hurdlers, runners and throwers who qualified.”
The competition begins today with the women’s 4×100-meter relay at 5:30 p.m. and runs through Saturday.

As part of a four-year-long initiative designed to upgrade all on-campus classrooms, more than 30 classrooms will be upgraded this summer to ensure the inclusion of up-to-date technology and furniture.
Current · Classrooms like this one in Allen Hancock Foundation Building allow students to use technological interactive learning tools. - Dieuwertje Kast  | Summer Trojan 
The university plans to upgrade 31 classrooms and two auditoriums this summer.
Before beginning this summer’s round of renovations, USC conducted surveys for approximately two weeks during November 2010 and most recently in April.
“We spent a lot of time and energy understanding what students need to learn and what faculty need to teach,” said Joseph Cevetello, director of learning environments for Information Technology Services.
Input was taken from approximately 12,000 students and 750 faculty members, in the two rounds of surveys taken.
“We have felt that students and staff are overwhelmingly supportive of change,” Cevetello said. “We want to ensure we make the right changes and make sure we’re meeting their needs.”
The project comes on the heels of a push by administrators to make USC’s classrooms more efficient learning spaces.
“The project is part of a multiyear initiative from the office of the provost to renovate all learning space on campus,” Cevetello said.
The project was launched last year with upgrades already completed in a total of 53 classrooms, two auditoriums and three computer rooms.
The total number of renovated classrooms over the course of the project is expected to be about 177.
“We are making these upgrades to make sure all USC classrooms can support the needs of students, staff and 21st-century mobility,” Cevetello said.
Upgrades are being completed in different areas within the classrooms, including upgrades in technology and infrastructure.
Cevetello said the upgraded classrooms would include a new arrangement of furniture to take better advantage of available space.
There will also be new walls and carpeting, which can help to improve the acoustics within classrooms.
Standard technology will also be enhanced in the upgraded classrooms, which will include LCD projectors and display panels, as there are still a few classrooms that lack these features. Other classrooms will have all of their old technology removed and will be equipped with new audio-visual features.
“ITS is committed to supporting the needs of an academic community that values a variety of learning experiences, ranging from multimedia-rich lectures to student-driven presentations,” Susan Metros, associate vice provost for ITS, told USC News in January.
According to Cevetello, classrooms were selected for upgrades based on two primary factors: the technology most in need of upgrades, and classrooms in buildings already being upgraded.
Last year, 10 classrooms in Taper Hall of Humanities were completely renovated.
This year the university will pick up where it left off and complete all upgrades in Taper by the end of the summer.
By mid-August, renovations in the Seeley G. Mudd Auditorium, the Social Science Building’s basement, the Von KleinSmid Center’s east wing and Waite Phillips Hall will also be completed.

The university formally connected its online professional graduate schools through a brand name and website called USCNow on Friday.
The website has general information about USC’s online degree offerings, although the specific programs are run through individual schools, as with all graduate degrees.
Six schools currently offer online courses, and four more plan to add professional degree offerings online in the year.
Mobile · Ebow Morgan, a 2011 in the MAT@USC program, completes his online coursework from various areas on campus via his laptop. - Aditya Tannu | Summer Trojan 
This reflects a growing trend as, both nationally and at USC, more students are enrolled online.
According to the 2010 Sloan Survey of Online Learning, more than 5.6 million students were enrolled in one or more online courses, 1 million more than in 2009.
One of the university’s fastest-growing online programs, the Master of Arts in Teaching through the Rossier School of Education, has also seen exponential growth. The MAT@USC program enrolled 144 students during its first year, 2009. This year it enrolled 1,000 students, and program directors expect an enrollment of around 2,000 students in the upcoming year.
USC’s first distance education program was through the Viterbi School of Engineering in 1972. Since then, the school’s program has expanded to include 38 master’s degrees and five certificate programs.
The Davis School of Gerontology, which launched its course website AgeWorks.com in 2002, has five online programs, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science offers both a master’s degree and a certificate in Geographic Information Systems and Technology and the School of Pharmacy offers the same in regulatory science.
The School of Social Work’s Master of Social Work program launched in October and has 300 students currently enrolled.
In the fall, both the School of Policy, Planning and Development and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism will launch master’s degrees in Public Administration and Communication Management, respectively.
The Keck School of Medicine has begun developing an online program in public health. The Marshall School of Business has also started work on an online program for a master’s in business administration.
In a press release, Provost Elizabeth Garrett said she was excited USC could reach more students.
“We are excited that the online delivery of education eliminates geographic constraints on our core mission — to change lives through education,” Garrett said.
I hope that these online programs do not water down the USC name and prestige.
You know that some Ivy leagues offer online MBAs?

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is the front-runner Republican in the race for the 2012 presidential nomination. The underwhelming crop of candidates is unprecedented in its apparent ineptitude and lack of notoriety. Though Romney is the early favorite to win the nomination, he still has some challenges ahead of him before he can hope to beat Obama.

Every time thus far a candidate has taken center stage, he has failed miserably.

Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich fell flat soon after launching his own campaign via Twitter: first attacking Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and congressional Republicans for their plan to eliminate Medicare and then, days later, embracing the plan.
Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty has failed to create any excitement in his recently announced campaign.
In addition, the two candidates many Republican strategists were most optimistic about, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, opted not to enter the race last month.
Given the lackluster field of candidates, Romney seems to be the only potential challenger with the ability to beat Obama in 2012. Romney is a proven businessman with executive experience as the governor of Massachusetts.
But Romney does not effectively connect with the American people, especially with those in his own party. After running an unimpressive campaign in 2008, Romney is back with few new ideas in his platform to offer in his second try for the nomination.
Romney launched his campaign on a farm in New Hampshire, the site of the first Republican primary and a must-win state for Romney. It was the typical presidential announcement, with Romney posing in front of a barn draped in the American flag. Romney has had a typical campaign: He has raised tons of money and has many Republican voters  backing him.
Yet Romney will not be able to win the Republican nomination because of the Tea Party. Romney’s damning mistake in the eyes of the socially conservative wing of the GOP is the universal healthcare plan he passed as governor of Massachusetts.
Romney’s healthcare plan shares similarities to Obama’s healthcare bill passed last year to the chagrin of Republicans. Romney has been dogged by the healthcare issue every step of the way.
The similarity most criticized is the individual insurance mandate, which requires people to purchase health insurance and punishes individuals who do not.
So far he has produced a handful of varied responses to inquiries about his healthcare plan. In a speech he gave in May, he defended his healthcare plan, stating it was an experiment in giving the state power to make such decisions.
All of his responses amount to one basic fact: Romney is trying, in any way possible, to disown his crowning achievement as governor.
And members of the Tea Party have made it abundantly clear they refuse to throw their support behind a man whose healthcare plan comes close to Obama’s federal bill. Because of this, Romney will have a hard time dealing with Tea Party darlings Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin, should either choose to enter the race.
The candidate who eventually secures the nomination will have to unite the establishment and Tea Party elements of the Republican Party.
In an attempt to do this, Romney has tried to pander to the Tea Party base, flip-flopping on gay marriage, abortion and, of course, healthcare.
He cannot run from the fact that he was a moderate Republican as governor of Massachusetts. Since that time, the Republican Party has shifted drastically to the right.
Romney is simply too moderate for the majority of Republican voters, and any attempt to change who he is will come off as blatant inauthenticity.

This “piece” is overly biased…we know what side of the fence that the author is is on from the very first paragraph. He doesn’t want anyone to even challenge his mulatto-prince Obama…. no one would be “good” enough. And the 2 comments below show a “herd mentality” way of college thinking… ONE WAY thinking. Obama went to Hahvud & is the most pious, sanctimonius, “I know better than you” intellectual that this world has ever known.
Romney does not have a compelling story like the Obama tale. He was born in wealth and has the typical views that the born to wealth have, “I know better than you, I care more than you.” Such views are a hard sell in the west and south.
You mean to tell me that America, in 2008, voted for a President because of his “feel good,” sob story? Rich people are usually coddled and hence not down to earth. They see things in ideals and unpragmatic ways, likewise to liberals…Well, gotta go. My Porsche GT2 is parked in front of a meter; the meter is running out.

The first orientation session for USC freshmen begins Thursday. Some of these new students might see this as the first step to an imminent independence. Most of these incoming undergraduates, however, probably don’t realize leaving their parents behind might be easier said than done once fall semester begins.
The Los Angeles Times recently published the second story in a five-part series discussing the evolving relationship between parents and children as technology advances. The article “The Bond: Staying in touch when children go to college” explains that new technologies, including Skype, Facebook, and unlimited texting and calling, have bound parents and students together for a longer period of time than in past decades.

Students need to take the first step in loosening the parental ties. Only then will the transition from dependence to independence take place.
College serves as the time for mom-and-dad-dependent teenagers to begin preparing for the world they’ll encounter in four years, at which point they should be prepared and self-reliant adults. This process is hindered when parents follow their children into college through constant communication via cell phone and computer.
Middlebury College psychology professor Barbara Hofer told the Los Angeles Times that students surveyed at Middlebury and the University of Michigan are in contact with their parents more than 13 times a week on average. Though this does not represent students at universities across the country, it can be assumed the students and parents of these two schools are using the same technology everyone else is using for communication.
Facebook “friending” the student and overusing a smartphone to stay attached can induce negative consequences. Rather than learning how to deal with difficult situations, they turn to their parents for help.
The article cited several of these instances. Some students send essays to parents to edit instead of using resources provided at school or asking a friend with writing talents. Other parents intervene during problems with roommates or departments at school.
Parents must let their young ones leave the nest. Otherwise, the relationship becomes a problem for students.
“They grow up essentially with the idea that they don’t have to separate from their parents,” said Sherry Turkle, a professor at MIT who specializes in technology and relationships, to the Los Angeles Times.
But they must separate. Once done with college, they can’t go into the workplace with their parents tagging along. Reducing communication between parent child helps the student move toward independence. Less communication means the student will solve problems on his own.
Parents justify their involvement in their young adult’s life by saying that the money being spent on a college education is reason enough to remain involved.
Parental involvement in the years leading up to and during high school most likely helped in getting the student into a reputable university. Once enrolled, the young adults have to take initiative in separating from their parents. Students need to think for themselves, prioritize and organize, and learn from their mistakes.
Complete independence while in college can’t easily be attained because students rely on their parents to pay for expenses but a certain amount of independence can be achieved to allow the student to learn to be self-supporting.

I COMPLETELY agree with this. I definitely relate to this. As a student, I feel like I appropriately detached from my parents and am a lot more grown up than my friends who fill their parents in on every facet of their lives. It’s ridiculous. I know it’s hard, but you must cut the cord–for good–at some point.
