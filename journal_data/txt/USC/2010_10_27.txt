LimeWire is dead.
Well, at least from here on out. The classic file-sharing software, known for enabling users in illegal music downloading, was disabled Tuesday after U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood issued a permanent injunction against it.
Earlier this year, the judge had granted summary judgment in favor of the music industry’s complaints about the effects of the popular software.  According to CNET News, these claims basically stated that LimeWire and its founder, Mark Gorton, had “induced copyright infringement” and had “engaged in unfair competition.”
Wood also ordered LimeWire to encourage users to essentially ditch the software altogether. This included anything and everything, from offering a tool to remove the program’s files permanently from hard drives to installing copyright filters to implementing default settings to block sharing of unauthorized media files.
Clearly, this move struck a significant blow to online media pirates everywhere. Right?
Yeah. Right.
The music industry should stop ignoring the fact that file-sharing software is more plentiful than Lindsay Lohan’s run-ins with the law. The peer-to-peer network protocols of Gnutella and hugely popular BitTorrent feature countless clients — programs that download and upload using the protocol itself — that quite literally run the gamut from A to Z. It’s like an infinitesimal, hair-tearing, business-based form of Whack-a-Mole: bring one program down and another springs up in its place.
The industry could also not ignore the fact that we simply don’t discover, acquire and share music like we used to in the good old days. The age of the Internet has always been about innovation and greater connectivity; unsurprisingly, listening to music changed along with everything else.
The industry could, of course, make a move toward the ambitious and undoubtedly intimidating goal of adapting to the dynamic, malleable media world of today.
But who are we kidding? The Recording Industry Association of America probably won’t do any of that. It will continue to play Whack-a-Mole, struggling headfirst against the tide, unwilling to recognize the fundamental mess of it all. The RIAA has always done that and seemingly always will. The question is, why?
The fact of the matter is this: fighting — and winning — the small battles against illegal file sharing doesn’t accomplish anything. According to CNET, RIAA lawyers said LimeWire cost record labels about $500 million a month.
Five hundred million? That’s a comical statement when you consider the implication: that shutting down LimeWire will bring $500 million back into the industry. I would love to see the RIAA’s collective revenue increase by $500 million next month. I could show the new figures to my mermaid girlfriend and her pet phoenix.
Yeah. Right.
The problem with this whole scenario is that there is a fundamental issue at hand. Simply put, people like to hear free music. And in many cases, songs will be downloaded, heard and discarded — an effect of experimentation, of trial and error.
Not everything one tries out is worth keeping. But a couple of downloaded songs can pique some interest. And that interest can lead to a person becoming a fan — one that spends money to support their favorite artists. I know that’s true of myself, and it’s a sentiment that is shared by many I know.
This is a part of music culture today, and record labels continually seem ignorant of that.
And from an objective, economic standpoint of the matter, the music industry really can’t be losing as much cash as it claims it does. One download does not equate to “x” amount of money lost, but it’s this sort of theoretical mathematics that is used to calculate the absurd dollar amounts that the RIAA claims it bleeds out.
After all, people only have so much money to spend — and it’s entirely possible that those who don’t pay for music now wouldn’t automatically start paying for songs, even if the laws were impassable. It could be that there would just be fewer people listening to music.
The Guardian looked into these numeric claims. As it turned out, the publication found that many of the values that record labels spit out are based upon their own estimations and broad assumptions, such as the aforementioned “one download = one lost sale” idea.
It’s certainly interesting that the RIAA states their numbers are from a “credible analysis” by the official-sounding “Institute for Policy Innovation,” which happens to be a conservative think tank.
The analysis itself is pumped full of curious averages and chooses to completely ignore two very important aspects of the issue: the positive impact of illegal music downloads (primarily that it provides an enormous amount of publicity for artists) and the positive economic impact of file-sharing companies. But hey, we should believe everything we read, right?
Yeah. Right.
Music piracy is a problem and yes, downloading free songs is illegal. But the RIAA should spend less money and time aggressively pursuing the superficial causes of the problem and begin to assess the true foundations of the crime.
Digital music sales are plateauing, and CD sales are on the decline; in certain ways, both indicate that a substantial shift in how music is marketed and distributed is due. The RIAA has already had to give up throwing lawsuits at old ladies and 13-year-olds.
But if it wants to keep playing Whack-a-Mole, well, I guess it’s a free country.

USC’s student-run radio station, KXSC, can now add another achievement to its list of awards.
KXSC recently beat out four other stations to win the “Biggest Improvement” award last week at the CMJ College Radio Awards in an annual conference held in New York City.
The station has been growing in size, getting more DJs and creating new programs, which contributed to the reception of the award, said Michel’le Roddy, promotions director of KXSC and a junior majoring in public relations.
“It’s very satisfying because all of our hard work is being recognized by people that are leading the industry for college radio,” Roddy said.
The station, which is completely funded by donations and sponsors, competed against four other radio stations that also made the final cut.
Since this was a national competition which also included schools from Canada, senior Karl Nickenig, general manager of the station, said he was humbled that the station took the award home.
“To be honest, I was pretty surprised. We had done a lot of work for it but we didn’t have high hopes coming into it,” Nickenig said. “I was very happily surprised with the results.”
According to Nickenig, winning the award consisted of several stages.
“You have to be nominated by multiple people such as industry promoters, representatives, record labels and other people working at CMJ,” Nickenig said.
Nickenig, who delivered an acceptance speech at the CMJ award ceremony, said the entire experience was surreal.
“It was a really great feeling. It felt incredible to be honored like that by your peers and other people in the industry,” Nickenig said. “I wasn’t expected to give a speech but I said thank you and I meant it.”
The radio station, which has 32 employees and numerous interns and volunteers, has been working hard to get its name out in the public.
Roddy has been with the radio station for the past three years and said she is excited about the direction the station is headed — which, she said, is largely because of the dedication of its employers.
“We don’t do it for the awards. We do it because we love radio, working with each other and doing quality broadcasting,” Roddy said. “All of these achievements will simply get people to know us more and listen to our radio station.”
The station is looking forward to a lot more in the upcoming future, Nickenig said.
“This is just the beginning,” Nickenig said. “Getting this award shows that people are starting to recognize us but we are in no way finished.”
This article was edited really poorly. You mention that Michel’le has been with the station for three years twice, you reuse her quote twice and there is a LOT of poor word choices. 
Good job, DT [sarcasm]
AWESOME JOB KXSC! [not sarcasm]

College is a time when anything and everything could happen — including getting sick. For those who hate to wait in long lines at the doctor’s office — and who doesn’t — there is a new service that instantly connects students to a doctor over the phone at anytime.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
RingADoc, based in Beverly Hills, is run through TeleThrive software. The service seeks to use the latest technology to expand and streamline health care access, according to the company’s website.
“I think the leaders involved in healthcare need to realize that our escalating physician shortage combined with increased patient demand is only going to continue to strain our health system and our ability to access medical care,” said Jordan Michaels, one of the founders.
Michaels, a USC graduate, and co-founder Mika Grossman believe RingADoc will be the quickest way to get the patient to a health care provider without having to deal with a lot of red tape.
When patients call in, they describe their chief complaints and are then connected to the appropriate TeleThrive physician provider. The physician then provides medical advice to the patient. Patients will have the option of speaking to a physician they have already spoken to if they are a returning caller.
Each call costs $39 — with or without health insurance. But, Michaels said, the company is working to lower costs for students.
“It’s one of my personal goals to partner with these health centers to reduce the $39 to a cost much more affordable for students,” Michaels said. “I am currently trying to work with USC Health Services as well.”
Although some hospital co-payments are more than $39, there are many that are cheaper, making RingADoc’s rates undesirable to some. Shannon Goddard, a sophomore majoring in business administration (cinematic arts), said she thinks the price should be reduced.
“In theory, I think this is a great idea because no one likes having to go to the doctor’s office or the health center and have to wait to get diagnosed,” Goddard said. “But the price seems a bit unreasonable, especially when I could go to the health center for ‘free’ with my insurance.”
Michaels said that the company has been approached by university and college health centers who are interested in offering this service as a supplement to the care they  already provided.
Global Medical Networks, P.C. provides the doctors that RingADoc members are connected with. The doctors are credentialed every year, making sure that the advice they give is sound.
“This is a feature I am very proud of,” Michaels said.
There are currently safeguards in place to prevent possible manipulation of the system for the purpose of obtaining prescriptions.
This service gives rise to a wide array of opinions. Eric Holoman, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said it is a good idea — as long as it is being monitored.
“I feel like there’s some room for misuse,” Holoman said. “Patients might try to get prescriptions they don’t actually need and doctors and … might prescribe medicines without looking at the case as thoroughly as they would in an office.”
Doctors are not allowed to prescribe any drugs that are easily abused, such as, Vicodin, Codeine and other drugs.
According to Michaels, this service is for those short-term health issues or concerns that might need short and quick prescriptions when patients are not able to get to a doctor, or if an appointment is unecessary.
“The doctors obviously understand the limitations of the telephone and therefore use professional judgment when considering a prescription,” Michaels said.
There are still some who are skeptical of the service’s worth, however.
“So, in the end, wouldn’t you have to go into the doctor’s office anyway?” Goddard said. “I believe that the most effective way to be diagnosed accurately is to actually go in and see a doctor face-to-face.”
Looks interesting.  Who is this jordan michaels guy?  I’d love to meet him.

Not wanting to spend a lot of money on a Halloween costume is no longer an excuse to be a witch or zombie for the seventh year in a row. Across Los Angeles there are tons of cheap costume shops, thrift stores and warehouses that will help you get creative and  ditch the broomstick.
Party City or Aahs are easy targets, but Halloween is about creativity, so wearing the same costume as someone else should be avoided at all costs. Sidestep the embarrassment and look elsewhere for ideas.
Start by trying to make your own costume with help from Michaels, the arts and crafts store. The nearest location is in Glendale, Calif. at 219 N. Glendale Ave., and is open from 9 a.m to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Yes, making a costume is challenging, but it is certainly much cheaper than either renting or buying one.
Cut up a white T-shirt, throw on some fishnets, buy striped red and white ribbon, make your own eye patch and fashion some cardboard into a sword. Twenty bucks later and boom, you’re a pirate. Men can do the same, though fishnets optional.
Cruise down Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood and tons of costume stores swarm both sides of the street, including Aardvark’s Odd Ark at 7579 Melrose Ave.
The prices range drastically at this vintage shop, but individual pieces will not cost as much as just one costume would, with the always needed, though never included, accessories found at traditional Halloween costume stores.
Aardvark’s has racks and racks of cheap, vintage clothing with an inventory capable of aiding your Captain Underpants idea. Their unique and ample selection is hard to find elsewhere, but be warned — there is that smell of “old-clothing” in the store. Stay strong, weed through the tons of options and keep your eye on the prize to find an innovative and cheap costume.
Make Believe Inc., located at 3240 Pico Blvd. in Santa Monica, will let you rent or buy costumes at reasonable prices. If you plan on partying with your parents, bring the whole family to Make Believe Inc.; it has costumes for men, women, boys, girls, tweens, toddlers and animals.
From a very detailed and embroidered Queen of Hearts Costume to a perfect ensemble for a couple wanting to dress up as bacon and eggs, you will not be lacking ideas or money after your visit. The prices vary depending on the costume and since rentals last two days, you can wear it multiple nights.
None of the costumes can be purchased but the multitude of accessories include colorful fishnet stockings and boas, bloody teeth, clunky chains, crowns and every hat imaginable.
Western Costume Company, located at 11041 Vanowen St. in North Hollywood, will let you rent any costume for up to a week after Halloween. The store offers thousands of costumes from many major movies, including Aladdin, Austin Powers, Bandito and Dumb & Dumber.
Some caution should be taken with this store because the costumes can get pretty expensive depending on how detailed they are, however, you can certainly find several costumes that are less than $50, such as Annie, a go-go girl, a race car driver, Miss Muffet — even a playing card.
The store is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m to 7 p.m and you can even sign up for its newsletter to be notified of store updates and discounts. The staff will help with everything necessary to pull off that great look, so ask for help if you’re stumped on how to put together a design.
Although it might not be the first thing to come to mind, Goodwill is also a great store to explore.  Located at 2823 S. Figueroa St, — just blocks away from campus — the prices can’t be beat.
Goodwill has a weekly sales page that can be found on its website that will help you save even more this Halloween season. Each store even offers a “Halloween Boutique” where browsers are encouraged to mix and match clothing and accessories to create an authentic look. The store also carries already-assembled costumes with a wide selection of accessories including shoes, boots and masks.
Whoever said trick or treating was only acceptable until the age of 14 was the same person that told you to wear your ghost costume for the third Halloween in a row. Whoever this Negative Nancy is, she doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
Hit up these cool and cheap places and make jaws drop. When else can you pretend to be someone else for a night or an entire weekend — depending, of course, on whether your professors thought it would be a good idea to schedule an exam on Nov. 1.

For everything from Halloween sneak peeks to non-holiday-related events that offer some great entertainment, you need not look farther than here on home turf.
Campus will be abuzz this weekend with various activities to choose from, most free of charge to USC students, so take advantage of all the campus has to offer.
To start things off right, Thursday will offer some shows that, although not holiday-themed, are sure to provide quite a bit of entertainment.
The Colored Museum
The play runs Oct. 28-31 at the Scene Dock Theatre near Parking Structure A. Written by George C. Wolfe and directed by Gregg T. Daniel, it focuses on the life of African Americans living in the 1980s with a satirical twist. Thursday’s show will kick off at 7 p.m.
Tickets are available in the USC Ticket Office but if you purchase them at the theater, they are only $5 for students, $8 for faculty and staff, and $10 for the general public.
The Who’s Tommy
If you’re up for more a musical number, head over to Massman Theatre at 7:30 p.m. for the premier of The Who’s Tommy. Taking its cue from the band’s 1969 rock opera, the play tells the story of Tommy, a disabled child, and the struggles his family faces raising him.
Directed by junior Luke Kanter, the show runs until Sunday and tickets are free, with a suggested $5 donation.
Smooth jazz and a smart rhymes
If you’re looking for something a little more mellow for your ears, head over to the ever-cozy Ground Zero. At 7 p.m. on Thursday there will be a Thornton Jazz Night free of charge. Grab some raspberry tea or a thick shake and take in all the jazz the  music students have to offer.
To further pursue your artsy streak, trek past the USC Pertusati Bookstore to USC’s very own Fisher Museum of Art for a special event discussing paintings and poems. “Turning Paintings Into Poems: How Poets Look at Art” will take place at 3 p.m. on Oct. 28 and will feature guest speaker poet Tom Healy, introduced by California Poet Laureate Carol Muske-Dukes. The event is free of charge.
Pumpkin Fun Run
It’s exactly what it sounds like. At noon on Friday, for just a $5 entry fee, you can run with a pumpkin at the Lyon Center. The race is organized by USC Recreational Sports and takes place every October, with participants from all aspects of the university: students, faculty and staff.
Go see if you favorite professor can beat you at a race — or the other way around. Pumpkins, however, are not provided, so make sure to bring your own.
Thornton Apollo and Oriana Choirs
For something a little more classical, head over to the Alfred Newman Recital Hall at 8 p.m. on Friday to hear the Oriana Women’s Choir showcase its talent with a performance that includes Halloween songs. The Apollo Men’s Choir will also perform and tickets are free.
Party at the Darkside
At 8 p.m. on Saturday you can dance the night away on the Parkside lawn with appearances from Maureen’s Band, The Cleanse, Down to Funk and DJ Will.
The event is free of charge and attendees can participate in a raffle and costume contest.
But it’s on Sunday where the fun really begins with two screenings, The Walking Dead and The Bunny Game, that are sure to knock your socks off and supply you with free entertainment:
The Walking Dead
At 10 p.m. on Sunday walk over to the Norris Cinema Theatre and celebrate the premiere of AMC’s adaptation of the zombie apocalypse graphic novel series The Walking Dead. The screening will broadcast the premiere live, allowing attendees to join in on the fun with other fans — just be sure to reserve a spot online so you have a seat.
The Bunny Game
How about watching a movie perfect for the holiday spirit? Outside the Box [Office] will be presenting a screening of The Bunny Game, directed by Adam Rehmeier, in the Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre. The film is a story about a woman on the streets who accepts an invitation from the wrong guy.
Viewers beware — the movie is extremely disturbing and also contains strong sexual material. Perfect for a Halloween night, the movie will screen for free on Sunday at 6 p.m. in the Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre in the George Lucas Building but is open to USC students, faculty, staff and alumni only. Those wishing to attend can make a reservation by visiting cinema.usc.edu.

Halloween has its own style. Foggy haunted castles, dark, terrifying sights and ghoulish creatures. Of course, America has its own style as well — taking holidays and turning them into big parties.
With Halloween weekend kicking off tonight — people have to start early — it’s time to take a look at the oddball, historical and debaucherous events going on over the next four nights. Los Angeles is a metropolis of endless possibilities, and spending Halloween in the City of Angels can be a great experience — it’s just a matter of finding the right event to suit certain tastes.

The horror films of old
In the 1930s, Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff were cinema gods — well, more like cinema ghouls. The iconic actors behind Universal Pictures’ classic versions of Dracula and Frankenstein teamed up for a few horror films through the decade, including The Raven and The Black Cat.
Hollywood Boulevard’s Egyptian Theatre will be showing a double feature of those two films tonight at 7:30 p.m. For classic horror film fans and newcomers alike, seeing the two horror icons match wits is quick an experience.
For a more comedic touch, the Hammer Museum will screen Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein at 11 a.m. on Halloween. Although Bud and Lou’s jokes are the focus of the film, the movie is a great example of a Universal “monster mash” piece and it features Lugosi’s last, iconic performance as Count Dracula.
Haunted horse riding — minus the horses
Amid all of the glitz and glamor offered by Hollywood clubs, Bar Sinister stands out. A Gothic-industrial club where black clothes are a must, the bar avoids heavy death metal and other overdone “dark” trappings, with patrons more likely to hear Depeche Mode or Nine Inch Nails blasting from the speakers.
With candelabras lining the walls, lavish red and black curtains and lots of wrought iron, it certainly fits the mood and look for Halloween. Why go to a club whose idea of Halloween means adding a few pumpkin decorations when you can embrace the holiday’s atmospheric origins?
On Saturday, Bar Sinister hosts its second annual “Ghostly Equestrian Ball.” With live shows from acts like The Henchmen and Veil Veil Vanish, the party is half concert, half bondage-laced costume party.
Lose your (Rocky Horror) virginity
No matter how many times people watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show, they are considered “virgins” until they see it at a screening party.
Tonight at 8 p.m. The Wiltern hosts a screening of the show, complete with live performances from Danny DeVito, Billy Idol and Jack Nicholson, among others. Although tickets are pricey at $50, the funds go toward charity groups.
For fans who can’t get enough of sweet Transylvanian transvestites, the Nuart Theatre will screen the film the following night — for only $10.50
Dios de los Muertos
The 11th annual celebration of the Day of the Dead at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery will run from Friday night through Saturday. For $10, guests can feast on Mexican food, create tributes and memorials for deceased loved ones, and join others for a supernatural and ethereal experience, giving participants a chance to explore another culture and get a fresh taste of the Halloween frights.
This year’s celebration is a joint festival for the holiday and for the bicentennial of Mexican Independence. Along with the food and activities, the event features live performances from Carla Morrison, Imperial Silence and Ruben Albarran.
Hard Haunted Mansion
The just-off-campus holiday staple returns for another year. Split between Saturday and Sunday, the rave in the Shrine Auditorium features an extremely impressive lineup, with acts like Fake Blood and Nero.
The real treat will be the headliners. Saturday features The Bloody Beetroots and Sunday will have the long-running English electronic act, Underworld.
Los Angeles is a city known for sunshine, surf and bright, happy lives. Yet, the city does a great job of wrapping itself in a dark cloak and embracing the fun and spirit of Halloween.
So whether it’s parties, movies or a chance to see Jack Nicholson in a corset, get out and explore the city. Los Angeles isn’t the perfect setting for a classic horror film, but it knows how to celebrate All Hallow’s Eve.

After joining forces with the Neighborhood Academic Initiative to mentor local high school students in writing and college preparedness, USC’s Joint Education Project is continuing to expand its programs.
Through JEP’s new programs, NAI students from Foshay High School are able to receive support and tutoring from a USC mentor. The Writing-Mentoring Program, launched in the spring, now includes 19 USC mentors who serve 44 NAI students.
NAI, a program designed to prepare low-income students for admission to USC, is a rigorous six-year commitment made available to students from USC’s neighboring Foshay and Manual Arts schools.
USC mentors are able to help students in the community while strengthening their own literary and writing skills. Mentors and students meet on USC’s campus each week to discuss literature and college admittance, said Alice Villasenor, JEP’s director of Public Humanities Initiatives. Villasenor said she believes the students enjoy the connection they make and often discuss personal and moral development as well.
“The Writing-Mentoring Program has been a great opportunity for students to connect with community students and connect to books,” Villasenor said. “It really is a two-way street, which is the essence of service learning.”
USC writing mentors are available to the high school students to help them reach their goal of attending USC or another university. The program includes a focus on personal statement writing and preparation for the SAT, and those who complete the program and meet USC’s admission requirements are awarded a full 4.5-year financial package.
Sara Kanematsu, a junior majoring in English who helped start the Writing-Mentoring program, said the high school students she works with are very motivated.
“I was able to see the students develop their own ideas and translate that into writing, which was a really cool experience to be part of,” Kanematsu said.
This semester, JEP launched its Open Classroom Project to allow NAI students to attend USC classes with their mentors. Through the Open Classroom Project, the USC mentor is not only an academic resource, but also serves as a liaison to the university, Kanematsu said.
“Since the age gap is so small, it’s a great opportunity to get to know the students personally while taking them through college and stuff they are doing in class,” Kanematsu said.
Foshay students grades 9-12 can attend a broad spectrum of classes, including geology, psychology and post-World War II foreign policy.
“It can be motivating for these kids to see the goal they are working towards and know they have extra support to get there,” Villasenor said.
Hannah Salter, a freshman majoring in neuroscience who volunteers with JEP, said she values the unique opportunities she has as a resident in the USC neighborhood.
“The kids love having a role model,” Salter said. “They love sharing their stories and telling us about their lives.”

The Thornton School of Music has begun the final transition into its new facilities, beginning with the use of practice rooms in Gateway Apartments by music students.

The old practice spaces, which held pianos and rooms for music students to rehearse, were in the Practice and Instructional Center located next to Cromwell Field.
PIC permanently closed Friday morning, and students began using the new Gateway practice rooms on Monday morning. The school moved all of the pianos and other instruments to Gateway over the weekend.
“When we had the opportunity to go to Gateway … this was wonderful,” said Robert Cutietta, dean of the Thornton School of Music. “Practice rooms are so critical for everything we do.”
The school is still moving into three new buildings, previously occupied by the School of Cinematic Arts, which are located next to the existing music school.
The buildings will house faculty offices, jazz studies rehearsal rooms and larger venues for orchestras and ensembles.
Cutietta said the construction, which is nearly done except for some practice rooms, will be finished by Thanksgiving, if not earlier.
“It’s been very disruptive this semester. Everybody has been extremely understanding,” he said. “I’d always said that fall semester it’s going to be a disaster, for some areas it certainly has been.”
Currently, the jazz studies department does not have anywhere to practice, but Cutietta said the school is finding space to accomodate them.
“Everyone knew it was coming, it’s like a construction zone that you know you’re going to be repairing a street. You’re going to be inconvenienced,” he said.
In total, the increased construction and moving of practice rooms will add about 40 percent more space to what the school had before, based on square footage, Cutietta said.
Thornton did not make a decision on where the practice space would be until last May, Cutietta said. Previously, the school scrambled to find space after the announcement that PIC would be torn down.
President C.L. Max Nikias, then the provost of the university, decided that the space in Gateway would go to the new rooms, which are bigger and use more technology.
Some policies for the new rooms have also changed. Security is tighter; students must have an I.D. and be a music major or minor to access the rooms. Access is now available 24/7, however, compared to last year’s limited hours.
“Prior to this, many of our practice rooms were being used by students who weren’t music majors, who weren’t music minors,” Cutietta said.
There will also be a DPS guard at all times for the back entrance to the Gateway practice rooms.
The technology in the practice rooms has been updated as well. Students can now record and transfer their rehearsals to a computer, or change the acoustics of a room to sound like an arena or cathedral.
Mitsuko Morikawa, a doctoral student studying music performance, said she was still adjusting to the new space.
“The acoustics are better, I like it because the ceilings are higher,” she said.
Jose Soto, a doctoral student studying musical performance, said the new rooms are a great improvement on those in PIC.
“This is unbelievable,” he said. “This is the best facility in the country.”

This weekend, many USC students will flock to the neighborhood surrounding the University of California, Santa Barbara, a place known for its Halloween festivities.

Two years ago, UCSB officials issued a letter discouraging  outside students from making the drive to Santa Barbara, mainly because of the mess and havoc that outsiders wreak on the community during Halloween weekend.
This year, UCSB officials are again discouraging students from coming for several reasons.
“It’s as if a bunch of strangers came into your house and were heavily involved in leaving it in disarray and trashing it,” said Michael Young, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at UCSB. “And then leaving it with no responsibility for that.”
Most of the Halloween activities occur in the jurisdiction of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, a substation for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s department.
The patrol will be involved in a strict enforcement policy this weekend, with measures including a stringent noise ordinance and a no-warnings policy — officers will immediately cite and arrest someone if they see a violation. Additionally, officers will tow any cars that are illegally parked.
“What we’ve tried to do is sort of prepare people for what they might experience if they come here,” Young said.
USC has no policy preventing students from going to UCSB, but Michael L. Jackson, Vice President for Student Affairs at USC, said he prefers students stay closer to home this Halloween.
Jackson encouraged a number of safety precautions for those students that choose to travel to Santa Barbara this weekend.
“Do not drink and drive, look out for one another, don’t accept drinks from strangers and if you are too tired after partying, rent a hotel room and drive back the next day,” Jackson said.
Though both administrations said they don’t support students traveling to Santa Barbara, many students said Halloween at UCSB is an unforgettable event.
Alison Kaprielian, a sophomore majoring in business administration, made the trek to Santa Barbara last year and saw the mess the morning after Halloween.
“I understand [UCSB’s concerns], but at the same time it’s a huge part of the culture of Santa Barbara,” Kaprielian said. “It’s also fun for the people from Northern California and Southern California to kind of meet halfway and celebrate Halloween.”
It is not just USC students who travel to Santa Barbara; the tradition applies to people all across California.
“People come all the way from Arizona, San Diego, Cal Poly,” said Tyler Garvin, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering. “Santa Barbara is famous nationally for Halloween.”
Neither Garvin nor Kaprielian are traveling to Santa Barbara this year because of other plans.
Neither will Adam Smith, a senior majoring in business administration.
“I just went once and it was enough,” Smith said.
That being said, all three students recommend making the trip at least once during college.
Young, however, stressed the impact the mess leaves on the Santa Barbara community.
“At a time when the county government is in deficit, they’re having to spend tens of thousands of dollars to prepare for a bunch of people to come in from outside to trash the place and then leave,” Young said.
According to Young, more than 95 percent of the arrests and citations made during Halloween weekend have been to people not from the community.
“A lot of our students even are pushing in the interest to keep it local, and keep it safe,” Young said.
UCSB senior Jeffrey Tsutsuse is one of them. Tsutsuse said that during his freshman year, he invited friends to UCSB for the holiday, but after spending time taking care of drunk students from other schools, his mindset changed.
“Now I am against having people come to UCSB because I would rather have fun without having to think about where my friends are and if they would make it back OK,” Tsutsuse said.
We should be honored that thousands of drunk people trash our neighborhoods and leave the next morning with out cleaning it up? It isn’t xenophobia my friend, it is called environmental and social concerns. A couple of years ago when it rained heavily during Halloween, I invited 50 or so drunk college kids into my apartment lobby so they won’t fall sick because of that rain. There were thousands more that night in IV who didn’t have a place to go and get a shelter.  
What is the point of getting a college degree at a prestigious university like USC, if you can’t understand others’ point of view and think critically? I might not be able to convince you not to come, but I ask you to please keep the local community in mind and avoid trashing the place. Like I said, the people that clean up after you would be high school kids, habitat for humanity, UCSB volunteer groups and residents like me.
Santa Barbara, along with UCSB, ought to be honored to have guests flock to their community during Halloween. What is it, with this xenophobia? I’m coming Syler, so don’t you worry buddy.
Please don’t come to SB. It is a huge burden for the local community to clean up all the beer cans and bottles. Tons of trash gets dumped into the ocean and all of it washes ashore two mile north and south of Santa Barbara. It is a horrible sight, and volunteer groups from high schools and local interest groups have to clean up all the mess that gets created. Please I beg you.

Student organizations are collaborating with the university to make an “It Gets Better” video as part of a nationwide campaign to voice support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teens after a string of suicides among gay youth.
“It Gets Better” is an online video project started by Dan Savage, a journalist known for his internationally syndicated sex column “Savage Love,” in which people post videos online supporting LGBT youth.
“People can post videos talking to LGBT youth, talking about their own experiences coming out or talking about their life now,” said  LGBT Resource Center Director Vincent Vigil. “It’s to let them know that you have tons of support. Try to find support that’s out there. It will get better, please use resources. Don’t take your life.”
The LGBT Resource Center, Lambda LGBT Alumni Association, the LGBTQ Faculty and Staff Alliance and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly are all working on the video. Vigil said about 30 students, as well as some faculty and alumni, were interviewed for the project.
“My hope is for people to know online and people that are here at USC that we’re a safe and affirming environment for them if they identify as LGBT,” Vigil said. “It’s a positive message to send out to our students to let them know that they have resources here and if they’re feeling depressed or lonely, to please stop by our center and utilize the resources we have on campus.”
Vigil said he plans to post the video on the “It Gets Better” YouTube page and on the USC YouTube page.
“Once it’s finished, we’re going to try and get it to go viral [and] have people on Facebook send it from friend to friend to friend, post it on people’s walls so that it spreads,” Vigil said.
Chris Berry, a graduate student studying math, shared his story about growing up in a conservative environment in Orange County. Berry said he believes that growing up would have been easier if he experienced more visible support, like the “It Gets Better” videos.
“I basically said that anyone growing up in a place where they don’t fit in, things will get better. They will go somewhere and find a community,” Berry said. “We as a university are a caring community and we support those who are part of our community and it shows that we want to have an impact in peoples’ lives and be an element for change for the better.”
Greg Oertel, a sophomore french horn performance major, said he talked about the difficulty of belonging to a Mormon family and coming out, considering the church’s conservative stance on homosexuality.
“I was in a really depressed state, but eventually my family was able to be OK with it, or if they weren’t, be OK with it around me and support me. It ultimately made me a happier person,” he said. “It was great to know I had the love and support of my family.”
Oertel said he looked to the news and popular media to find visible support.
“I didn’t know anybody personally to talk to about this issue,” Oertel said. “I did look to celebrities as a beacon, like Ellen DeGeneres, and the life that she lived, but I didn’t know anybody, I was in an environment where we didn’t talk about gays.”
Vigil said that although the main purpose of the video is to reach out to struggling LGBT youth, he said he also hopes the video will show prospective students a glimpse of USC’s welcoming community.
“If I’m a prospective student and I see that USC put this video together, it’s going to say a lot to me, especially if I’m the mother or father of a prospective student and see how welcoming USC is,” he said.
Vigil said the LGBT community at USC has become more visible over the past few years.
“We’re come a long way if you look back 10 years, up until now. USC has the stereotype of being very conservative … but students would argue that it is a very liberal and inclusive place,” Vigil said.
Jenny Ham, an undecided sophomore, said that she became involved as an ally through her work as a Undergraduate Student Government residential senator.
“This year, being in USG really opened my eyes to the types of people out there and understanding their day-to-day struggles,” she said. “QuASA has grown so much. Their events and their support are everywhere. Everywhere you go you’ll see LGBT students, and you can’t deny that they’re not there or that they’re not like you because they’re not straight.”
The overall purpose of the video is to tangibly show support for the LGBT community at USC and LGBT youth around the world, Ham said.
“Things like this  make USC a stronger community. USC recognizes the slight differences among people, but at the same time accepts them as a whole, because we’re USC students — we’re Trojans,” Ham said. “Whoever you are — whether you’re gay or straight or bisexual or whatever — we embrace you and won’t exclude you in any way.”
“Whoever you are — whether you’re gay or straight or bisexual or whatever — we embrace you and won’t exclude you in any way.”…Now THAT is Royal B.S.  You Know it. I know it. The World knows it. You’re not fooling ANYbody. e.g. What if you’re Ann Coulter? Sean Hannity? Michael Savage? When will you come to grips with the TRUTH?
It is great to see USC taking a lead on this.  Bullying is not okay whether in elementary school, high school, college, or even post-school.  Hopefully this helps get out the message that it truly does get better.

In the past, USC has always steered clear of the spread offense—this might change next year, with coach Lane Kiffin hinting that the spread offense might be what’s best for the team.
“Look at what we have,” Kiffin said. “We have a bunch of really good receivers and tight ends and backs. We don’t have a fullback that’s on our roster two months from now. We’ll have to make the best of whatever we’re dealt with.”
The team currently preparing for top-ranked Oregon on Oct. 30, a team that leads the nation in total offense and scoring offense with the spread offense.
USC has begun using some aspects of the spread offense in its no-huddle package, but next year could bring about a big change nonetheless.
The Trojans have used a pro-style offense since Pete Carroll’s arrival at USC. The spread offense, however, is catching on in colleges across the nation, though rarely used in the NFL.
USC’s possible change in strategy is in some part a byproduct of the projected roster for 2011. The Trojan offense will see a lack of fullbacks on the roster, as well as scholarship restrictions thanks to NCAA.

“Save the boobies.” “Pink for the cure.” “Mama get a mammogram.”
These witty slogans are none other than catchphrases for the Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, which is again sweeping campus this October — Breast Cancer Awareness Month — to raise funds for USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center’s breast cancer research.
Beginning the first week of October, “Fight On for the cure” shirts — as well as a plethora of other breast cancer merchandise in various shades of pink — popped up in the USC Pertusati Bookstore.
These shirts, which sell for $17.99 each, donate $8 from each sale to the Norris Center, according to USC Bookstores Director Daniel Archer. Archer said that 2,200 of these shirts have been sold at the campus bookstore to date.
“Buck slips” next to the cash registers at the bookstore also offer customers the opportunity to donate $1, $5 or $10, and approximately $3,500 have been raised from the slips at the bookstore alone.
An estimated $21,000 has been raised to date, all of which will be donated directly to Norris Center.
As wonderful as it is that USC’s private cancer research institute is receiving this much-needed funding, the educational and awareness efforts have been met with less enthusiasm than the introduction of well-fitted American Apparel cotton shirts that declare support for a trendy cause.
“This campaign was not necessarily student-based, but Trojan-based,” Archer said. “Most of the buyers of the shirts were alumni on game day. The events that the Norris Center planned for this campaign did not have such a student-centered viewpoint.”
Indeed, before the student body of USC is lauded for being so generous and proactive in the fight against breast cancer, the reality is that a majority of the student body was not heavily involved in the awareness month.
Events that could have easily promoted awareness on campus, such as a Race for the Cure run, guest speakers or even informative literature were absent in this campaign.
The Norris Cancer Center did not create a heightened awareness on campus; in fact, its only open demonstration of involvement with Breast Cancer Awareness Month was its one-time booth at the football game.
Essentially, the month-long campaign has revolved around persuading every member of the Trojan Family to buy Breast Cancer merchandise.
The purpose of the campaign was to raise funds — which it did with spectacular success, thanks to the marketing of the Norris Center.
“It was seamless,” Archer said about the combined efforts of the Norris and the USC bookstores. “It’s something that is easily merchandised.”
Undeniably, there is something about the little pink ribbon which gives it a distinctive edge over any other symbol for fall.
September, which is nationally recognized as Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, did not see an onslaught of blue ribbons and shirts at USC, despite prostate cancer claiming a statistically comparable number of victims as breast cancer.
“I can’t say why breast cancer over colon cancer or lung cancer,” Archer said. “There’s no one cancer better to support than the other. The nation just seems to be enthusiastic about this particular cause.”
Despite taking the easiest, seemingly superficial route to reach its financial goals, the Norris Cancer Center can be applauded for effectively raising funds while making breast cancer a highly present symbol on campus for the month of October.
Hopefully, this campaign can reach out to students as well as alumni to go beyond simply flaunting a sticker, and to strive to actually become more informed about breast cancer, and volunteer or donate to the cause.
It is not too late to get involved. Aside from making donations at the bookstore, you can donate online at  http://uscnorriscancer.usc.edu.
And if you really are craving one of those cute pink shirts, the Norris Center will be offering one free through the month of October if you stop in to get a mammogram.

During these still floundering economic times, one might expect large college donations to go down.
Not in USC’s case.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
A few timely — and critical — donations to USC have completely redefined the future possibilities of the university as it moves forward under President C.L. Max Nikias’ new administration.
Microsoft recently pledged support to the Interactive Media Division of the School of Cinematic Arts, the Annenberg Foundation donated $50 million for a new journalism building and USC trustee and alumnus Ming Hseih provided another $50 million to create an institute focused on cancer research.
Though the recent influx of donations to USC’s professional schools might seem like a coincidence, they all stem from the donors’ shared confidence in the future success of our university.
These benefactors clearly believe that their money will go toward a good cause. With an experienced leader such as Nikias, it’s no surprise that donors are knocking on our door.
It was only fitting for both the Annenberg and Hseih donations to be announced during Nikias’ inauguration, when thousands of USC’s supporters were on campus.
Less than a week later, Microsoft seized the opportunity to create the Microsoft Endowed Professorship and the Game Innovation Lab.
From medical advances to state-of-the-art journalism resources and innovations in gaming, each of these areas will gain a significant and competitive advantage over the rest of the pack.
But what unites these varied fields? The rapid evolution in technology that demands creativity in all areas.
Wallis Annenberg, chair of the Annenberg Foundation, told the Los Angeles Times that students and faculty need “to experiment with emerging tools and invent the newsrooms, online media and broadcast studios of the future.”
Tracy Fullerton, SCA professor and acting chair of the Interactive Media Division, told USC News that Microsoft’s support will provide much-needed experience in the “emerging discipline of games-user research.”
Both the donors and the university’s leadership see eye to eye — we must continue to push the boundaries of technology and academia while we have the momentum.
Both sides have made careers of redefining our university resources, and neither side will relent.
As many universities are struggling to attract large investments as the country crawls out of the recession, USC must utilize — and strengthen — its partnerships now more than ever before.
Though these donations might put us ahead in the race, our university won’t forget its biggest partnership: the students who will take this financial support and transform it into a positive, societal impact.
Although USC is a large institution, we must not think for one second that we aren’t a part of the process. We are the largest stakeholders.
Imagine a 400-meter relay. The starter — the benefactors and generous supporters — begins the momentum with an infusion of financial and professional support. That donation is passed off to the university administration, which paces itself and times the allocation of these resources perfectly.
But then there’s the anchor. And in this case, it’s the students, eager to innovate and expand their knowledge, who finish the race by putting these resources to work.
The students will always be counted on by our supporters and administration to come through in the clutch; making what we want of these generous opportunities.
But we aren’t just relied upon by our teammates. We are being cheered on by the fans in the stands — those in our surrounding neighborhoods, our community and our world who root for our problem-solving and innovation in a rapidly changing industry.
Some might not see the relationship between benefactors, administration, students and the outside community as being a cycle of innovation and progress. In fact, these groups might be in it for their interests alone.
But if a donor just wanted his or her name on a building, or if an administration wanted to take all the credit for the university’s status, then such large gifts would be only a one-time occurrence.
Instead, these donations are reoccurring. The same businesses, foundations and individuals continue to provide support to the Trojan Family in hopes of fueling greater ideas for the future.
Let’s continue to give them a reason to do so.

Money did NOT cut UC Berkeley student sports. When UC Berkeley announced its elimination of baseball, men’s and women’s gymnastics, and women’s lacrosse teams and its defunding of the national-champion men’s rugby team, the chancellor sighed, “Sorry, but this was necessary!”
But was it?  Yes, the university is in dire financial straits.  Yet $3 million was somehow found to pay the Bain consulting firm to uncover waste and inefficiencies in UC Berkeley, despite the fact that a prominent East Coast university was doing the same thing without consultants.
Essentially, the process requires collecting and analyzing information from faculty and staff.  Apparently, senior administrators at UC Berkeley believe that the faculty and staff of their world-class university lack the cognitive ability, integrity, and motivation to identify millions in savings.  If consultants are necessary, the reason is clear:  the chancellor, provost, and president have lost credibility with the people who provided the information to the consultants.  Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau has reigned for eight years, during which time the inefficiencies proliferated.  Even as Bain’s recommendations are implemented (“They told me to do it”, Birgeneau), credibility and trust problems remain.
Bain is interviewing faculty, staff, senior management and the academic senate leaders for $150 million in inefficiencies, most of which could have been found internally.  One easy-to-identify problem, for example, was wasteful procurement practices such as failing to secure bulk discounts on printers.  But Birgeneau apparently has no concept of savings:  even in procuring a consulting firm, he failed to receive proposals from other firms.
Students, staff, faculty, and California legislators are the victims of his incompetence.   Now that sports teams are feeling the pinch, perhaps the California Alumni Association, benefactors and donators, and the UC Board of Regents will demand to know why Birgeneau is raking in $500,000 a year despite the abdication of his responsibilities.
The author, who has 35 years’ consulting experience, has taught at University of California Berkeley, where he was able to observe the culture and the way the senior management operates.
You may want to think about the people who are REALLY going to take the donated money and use it for good – the Professors and Researchers at USC. The students are not the anchor when it comes to innovation at USC, sorry.

With the cannabis conversation growing louder in California thanks largely to Proposition 19, there is one fact in particular can be recited verbatim: Under federal law, it is currently illegal to possess, use, buy, sell or cultivate marijuana.
In the last 20 years, however, many states have legalized the medical use of marijuana, citing several health benefits. It has been used as a progressive treatment for patients suffering from cancer, HIV/AIDS and even multiple sclerosis.
Although the federal government does not recognize marijuana as holding any medical benefits, many states have shown through law that they believe cannabis has a practical medicinal application.
Alice Li | Daily Trojan
In 1979, Virginia created a precedent by passing a law that allowed marijuana prescriptions for patients with cancer or glaucoma.
According to CNN, 14 other states have since followed suit. The federal government has always been fundamentally opposed to the legalization of marijuana, however, whether for medical or recreational purposes.
The Obama administration has taken essentially the same stance as previous administrations, the key difference being that it has refused to raid dispensaries throughout the country and are allowing individual states to continue to use the drug as a treatment.
But politics aside, it appears that public opinion about marijuana is shifting. Polls show that many Americans believe marijuana is an inherently harmless drug. A January 2010 poll conducted by ABC News and The Washington Post showed that 81 percent of Americans believe that medical marijuana should be legalized.
A 2009 National Survey on Drug Use showed that marijuana usage increased in all but two age groups — 45 to 49 year olds and those over 65 — in just one year. If marijuana held the addictive power that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration asserts, then where are the millions “addicted” to cannabis?
Cigarettes, unlike marijuana, have never been proven to hold any medicinal benefits. In fact, nicotine is one the most addictive forces known to modern science, and smoking cigarettes has been shown to greatly increase the likelihood of developing any of multiple forms of cancer.
Yet cigarettes remain legal, and are sold in almost every convenience store or gas station in the United States. Hypocrisy, thy name is the U.S. government.
Along with health benefits, the economic benefits of the legalization of marijuana would bolster both the California and national economies.  or so say advocates of Proposition 19, the proposition originated by activist Richard Lee that proposes the full legalization of the sale of marijuana to adults over the age of 21.
It would tax and regulate marijuana in the same manner as alcohol, meaning that laws about driving under the influence and public intoxication would remain in place, theoretically preventing the “mind-altering” effects of marijuana that lead to accidents and fatalities.
Marijuana is one of California’s highest-yielding cash crops and has created a $14-billion industry even while illegal. The revenue created by legalization — estimated to be another $1.4 billion — would immensely benefit the state’s tanking economy. It would also allow for more open research about the substance.
Although a full federal and nation legalization of cannabis is probably far-fetched, the country seems to be shifting toward a more liberal view of the substance itself.
More and more states are legalizing marijuana for medical use, and some states are researching the potential economic benefits of a full legalization. It is a controversial issue that requires deep research into both sides of the story.
However, the writing is already on the wall. Attitudes are changing, and the benefits  of marijuana are coming to light. The passage of Proposition 19 could definitively alter the future of California’s economy and budget crisis — it is one step of many to get the state back on the right track.
The taboo about marijuana is shifting with the times. The more we talk about it, the more moderated use of it becomes socially acceptable. We can now hope that legal acceptance will follow as well.

VOTE NO ON PROP 19
I don’t want to lose my job, its too profitable selling to your kids.
I love the fact that USC students can’t get excited about fighting against the spending that will force them to be indentured tax slaves for the rest of their adult lives, don’t care about the million and a half younger brothers and sisters of their generation that will be killed in the womb this and every year, don’t think the rule of law or the preservation of economic liberty is worth getting out of bed for…. but BOY are they excited about voting for prop 19!
Jesus said, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. (Matthew 7:12).  
I know I would not want my child sent to jail with the sexual predators, or my aging parents to have their house confiscated and sold by the police, over a little marijuana.  
We can change the world when we vote.
Prohibition is just a gift to mobs and narcos. Hemp (we should stop using this BS “marijuana” word as well) is not harmless but it is indeed less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, and yes it has various medical uses.
YES to proposition 19
Once  the law passes and the future taxes, will the cities and counties block the federal government’s demand to get tax rolls, so they can waltz in and make an easy arrest? What will the California juries do? Will they declare the federal laws unconstitutional and acquit? We can fight the federal power. We can empty our prisons of non-violent offenders. Less prisoners = closer to balanced budget
One governor candidate is voting yes on 19 – Dale Ogden
If you want Prop 19 to pass, you have to vote. Otherwise its a guaranteed failure. Elderly people vote like its their only purpose in life and they are against it 2:1. 
So, are you going to let them make the decision for you? Or, are you going to get out there and let your voice be heard?
VOTE! VOTE! VOTE!
If everyone who has the right to vote in California shows up, it will certainly pass. If you don’t show up, IT WILL CERTAINLY FAIL!!!
So, in short, if you don’t show up and vote YES, your silence means another vote for NO!
Hey man,
I totally agree with your Mental Mojo. The weed should totally be legalized. The longer it is illegal, the more youths that  experiment with Mary Jane will have to worry about losing federal scholarships or being criminalized by the prison system. I know a lot of Frat bros and athletes that love the sweet, sweet green, and they shouldn’t have to worry about federal prosecution. Those guys do community service stuff all the time, and they don’t want to hurt anyone, they just need a little something to relax after some mental workouts, you know. The fact that the government could raid frat row and bust everyone, is really scary and not something that students should have to worry about. They have tests, extra curricular activities and relationship problems that already burden their brains. 
On top of all that, it is kind of ludichris that we waste all this money on cops fighting weed. I was watching this TV show, with Steven Segal as a Lawman, and it hit me how nuts the whole thing is. We pay these cops thousands of dollars to stop some poor toothless dude from getting his groove on with 2 small bags of weed. Who cares? We waste money on jail time, on cop cars, gas, cop hours, prosecution, their food and phone calls, etc. How much money would we save as a state if we just let the home boy get his smoke on? Spend that money on education, on healthcare, fixing hospitals, real stuff that helps us.
I don’t mean to bum your vibe, but I’m not sure 19 will pass. Not because it’s a faulty law, but because too many people make money on it being illegal. The cops, the prison guards, the gangsters, the military industrial complex, even politicians profit from the drug war. All these people want things to stay the same so they can keep earning their green. But who knows, maybe Obama is right, and all the voters can be the change on election day. We’ll see what happens when all the smoke blows away.
Very good article, Mr.Behzadi.  The fact that Prop 19 even made it on the ballot is very encouraging.  I am for full legalization.  Decriminalization isn’t enough.  People–myself included–will continue to use marijuana over alcohol.  It is harmless when compared to alcohol or tobacco.  The opponents constantly say that legalizing it would make it easier for teenagers to access it.  The ones that want it–they already get it.  As far as rich people getting richer, that will always happen.  It happens with tobacco, alcohol, real estate–anything capable of making a profit.  This is about the individual right for a person to decide what he or she puts into their own body, without fear of having their doors kicked in and their families ripped apart, or using a possibly contaminated product that stems from the drug cartels.  Prohibition of alcohol led to violence of every kind, and the same goes for marijuana.
Punish someone for committing a ‘real’ crime.  
Bob, Prop 19 is an opportunity…a huge chance for this country to wake up the politicians and for them to take us seriously.  I don’t want to see a single person in jail over the plant.  Too many people need marijuana;  and not just the physically ill, but the mentally ill as well.  Personally, I’m tired of alcohol being the accepted celebratory tool used in this country for good occasions.  I’m a hell of a lot happier about things when I smoke a good joint.
The comparison to alcohol is spot on but the point was missed. It is illegal to drive while under the influence of alcohol but people do. I doubt if the judgement of of marijuana users is any better than people who drink. The age limitation will not be a factor because pot is already available to all ages. There are far too many dead teenage drivers already. Easily available marijuana will probably not improve their survival rate. By some estimates California is already a net exporter of marijuana, I doubt if the current growers will suddenly give up their lucrative trade and all those in the distribution line will still have criminal enterprises.
@bob: “Also, as of Oct 1, 2010, possessing an ounce of pot in California has ALREADY been decriminalized (no criminal charges, record or court). So who needs 19 anyway ? Other than big companies”
Are you forgetting that cannabis (the proper name) is still illegal to cultivate? The stupid law Arnold S signed only INCREASES the strength of the black market for cannabis… strengthens cartels and gangs. You need to think a little deeper.
And why rehash (pun intended) crap like passing prop19 is somehow evil because rich people crafted the legislation? With prop19 in place, people can and will grow their own which is a real relief for good people and a blow to the black market. It is so simple I wonder what you are smoking, Bob. And why should people continue to pay $200/ounce for Mexican swag weed and double that for high-grade US grown? Last I checked, a packet of 5 seeds bought online is around $40. You could grow many ounces for < $100. And also be sure that it has no pesticides or lead powder added. I don't trust thugs, not that I use cannabis or anything (I don't anymore).
Finally an article that wasn’t forged and repeated a hundred thousand times. Good job. 
The times they are a changing
What the article didn’t mention is:  that Proposition 19 is a scam designed by a couple of rich businessmen in Oakland to make themselves more rich.  Now people are starting to figure that out, which is why support is falling.  It isn’t even a real ‘people’s initiative’, but a sad example of how money can be used to buy legislation. 
  Personally, I favor legalization.  But when you look at the dark underside of Proposition 19, you’ll see that it is not only bad for the state’s economy but also for individual marijuana users.  
   An excellent website that explains what’s wrong with Prop 19 and where it came from is http://no-on19.com.
They’re a group of pot users and even they don’t want 19.
  Also, as of Oct 1,  2010, possessing an ounce of pot  in California has ALREADY been decriminalized (no criminal charges, record or court).  So who  needs 19 anyway ?    Other than big companies.  
  As of 1/1,  you can wave an ounce in front of police and at worst they might give you a ticket.
article didn’t mention prop19 was a scam.  if there trying to pull a scam CALL THE COPS (have you every heard of felony knowleague) if you know a crime is being committed (in this case a fed. crime) and you say nothing,your ass is in a sling. what does the dark underside of prop19 look like? give me some details(i for got you don’t have ANY) how is it bad for the state’s economy, give me some details(i forgot you don’t have ANY) how is it going to be bad for the individual MJ users,give me some details (i forgot you don’t have ANY) what’s wrong with prop19, give me some details (i forgot you don’t have ANY) where did prop19 (as you put it) ”come from” ,give me some details(i forgot you don’t have ANY)  if you ”favor legalization” why did you post this reply,give me some details(i forgot you don’t have ANY) if you know a ”group of pot users” CALL THE COPS,because it is a fed.crime to smoke MJ and because your not reporting it,your ass is on the line. and why don’t these ”pot users” want prop19,give me some details(i for got you don’t have ANY) AND THE REST OF YOUR REPLY IS B/S

As the date for the first installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows gets closer, fans can’t help but wonder what will happen to the stars of the saga when it ends. The characters that for a long time were portrayed by lovable trio Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are now leaving the screen. So where does that leave the actors?
For Rupert Grint, it means getting accustomed to completely different roles.
In an interview with Parade, he confessed “I’m really sad actually, I’ve missed it.”
He adds, however, that he looks forward to the change.
“But I think it’s a good time really to kind of move on. It has been a long time. After ten years, I do kind of want to stretch a bit more and explore different characters and do different things.”
How about an action comedy for his first non-Harry Potter role? Grint has been cast in Wild Target starring Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt. Fans now get to watch him perform various stunts while still portraying a character similar to his own personality.
“I’m quite gullible… this guy I play is just like that.”
At the premiere, viewers will be able to tell if Grint was able to move on from a character he invested so much time in and jump-start his basically new acting career.
And he doesn’t have a wand to help him do it.

USC freshman wide receiver Markeith Ambles has been suspended indefinitely from the team because of late arrivals to several mandatory team functions, sources said.
The 6-2, 215-pound Ambles, a native of McDonough, Georgia, has not made much of an impact in his first year with the Trojans, totaling only one catch for 3 yards in the four games he’s appeared in. That catch came in a blowout win against the 1-7 Washington State Cougars.
Head coach Lane Kiffin had originally planned to redshirt Ambles, but was unable to do so because of Ambles’ participation in the season opener at Hawaii.
The suspension is not the first time that USC has disciplined Ambles for being late. During a pre-season practice in August, Ambles was one of two USC players, alongside fellow freshman Dillon Baxter, who spent the entire session doing “rollovers.”
Kiffin said the reason for the punishment was “tardiness.”
Ambles was the fourth ranked wide receiver in ESPNU’s 2010 class and 23rd ranked player overall. He originally committed to Lane Kiffin during the coach’s time at the University of Tennessee but changed his commitment when Kiffin left Knoxville to replace Pete Carroll at USC.
The freshman wideout did not practice Tuesday and has not yet commented on the suspension. With the emergence of Robert Woods and Kyle Prater waiting in the wings, it may become difficult for Ambles to find playing time as the Trojans move forward.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman declined to stop airing negative ads on television at the annual Women’s Conference in Long Beach Tuesday, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Her opponent, Democratic Attorney General Jerry Brown, pledged moments before to end the negative advertisements after host Matt Lauer posed the question.
“Sometimes negativity is in the eye of the beholder,” Brown said, before agreeing to take down his negative ads if Whitman did as well. “If Meg wants to do that, I’ll be glad to do that.”
Whitman, however, responded that she would only take down only those ads that seemed like a personal attack on Brown.
“I will take down any ads that could be even remotely be construed as a personal attack, but I don’t think we can take down ads that talk about where Gov. Brown stands on the issues,” Whitman said.
Both made an appearance at the conference with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Actors Kal Penn and Melissa Fitzgerald joined forces Tuesday night to encourage students to support Democratic incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer in the Nov. 2 midterm election.
Boxer briefs · Actress Melissa Fitzgerald, Marlene Towns and actor Kal Penn (left to right) speak at an event hosted by the USC College Democrats on Tuesday to raise support for Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is running for re-election against Carly Fiorina. - Daniel Wang | Daily Trojan 
The actors were joined by Sen. Curren Price (D.-Calif.) and USC College Democrats faculty adviser Marlene Towns  in a discussion that was hosted by the USC College Democrats in The Forum in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Discussion topics ranged from Penn’s transition into politics to the political climate in the war-torn country of Uganda.
The focus remained, however, on dispelling the idea of an “enthusiasm gap” among young Democrats and on spreading the word on the importance of voting.
“Young people came out to vote [in 2008] because of issues that are now solved,” Penn said, referring to the war in Iraq and the healthcare overhaul. “If you have friends that aren’t sure why they should go vote, remind them of these.”
Fitzgerald, who played a White House staff member on The West Wing, said she only campaigns for candidates she respects.
“I do consider it a public service,” Fitzgerald said. “I’m inspired by issues and by people who remain strong in their own convictions.”
Penn, who said he is registered as an independent, said he rejects the term “politics” and prefers to call his political involvement a public service.
“If we just get rid of the nonsense of political parties, I think we’d be a lot farther than we are today,” Penn said.
Price also stressed the youth vote, noting that most young people carry political undertones.
“Don’t lose your enthusiasm or your spirit of adventure,” Price said. “Pursue those things that you have an interest in and make that a real calling. Anything you have an interest in has a political tinge to it and I encourage you to not lose that enthusiasm.”
Penn also spoke about his career as an actor, saying it was his belief in making the country better that ultimately led him to leave acting and enter politics.
“I used to do teen comedies,” Penn said, “so no one took me seriously before. The two worlds are completely different.”
Fitzgerald, on the other hand, said her compelling television role allowed for her voice to be taken more seriously in the political world.
“I was very fortunate to be involved in a show that was a public service,” Fitzgerald said. “I got so many amazing experiences and opportunities. … People take me a little more seriously because of that show.”
Towns, who served as the event’s moderator, also took time to encourage everyone to go out and vote.
“Go online, look at voter guides,” Towns said. “Do you guys know that little ‘I voted’ sticker? A lot of times, that’s a reminder. Corny as it may seem, wear it.”
USC College Democrats encouraged students to show up two hours early and volunteer for the chance to meet Penn and take a picture with him before the program. About 30 student volunteers reached 2,166 registered voters through a Get Out The Vote phone bank.
If those three luminaries had stuck to the business of Barbara Boxer instead of talking about themselves, the forum would have lasted four minutes.
Fight On!
JLH
Oh. Well by all means let’s take his political advice then.
Who the hell is Kal Penn
I think he’s the dude who portrayed that weed-smokin’ dope head in “Harold and Kumar go to White Castle.”

Some students say the prices at Seeds Marketplace in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center are too high, but USC Hospitality officials say the prices reflect the costs of a small-scale store.
Cashing out · Christine Tanguay, a junior majoring in architecture, makes a purchase at Seeds Marketplace in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan 
Seeds, new to campus, is both an eatery with made-to-order items such as sandwiches and salads and a miniature convenience store that sells grocery items, such as cereal, cookies and drinks.
Students said item prices are inflated; for example, a container of Chef Boyardee is sold for $2.49 — compared to a larger container for $1.69 at Vons — and a container of Campbell’s Soup sells for $4.99, compared to $1.89 at Vons.
Even though Seeds has become a popular spot for meals and a convenient source for groceries, some students said the prices make them less enthusiastic about the new store.
“It’s because it’s USC. Everything is a little more expensive or much more expensive, but we don’t have any other place to get it, so do we have a choice?” said Ahra Roh, a graduate student studying occupational therapy.
Likewise, Madeline Lansky, a sophomore majoring in political science, said Seeds is pricey but that high food costs are common on USC’s campus.
“I consider the food to be pretty expensive, but it’s pretty in line with how everything is priced on campus,” she said. “To be honest, most of us don’t even think about it. But when I take a step back and look at it, it’s pretty expensive for what you’re getting.”
On the other hand, some students said they consider Seeds to be adequately priced for its convenience and quality.
“[The prices are] moderate. The sandwiches might be a little small for their cost but they’re really good so I find that acceptable,” said Jared Sokol, a freshman majoring in biochemistry.
In response to those who might ask for lower prices, Sokol defended quality over quantity.
“It’s high quality products. I don’t think [students] really realize that. And that translates into more expensive prices,” Sokol said.
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said he admits that some items are priced higher than neighboring grocery stores.
“That’s because they buy hundreds of cases and we may just buy one,” he said. “They’re not easy to get if you’re not a large grocery store and don’t have the volume that a Ralphs or a Vons has so it was a little more expensive for us to get.”
Although there is a difference in pricing, the convenience of a grocery store on campus makes providing the products — even at a higher price — worthwhile, Klinger said.
“[Seeds] was a concept that we created because we thought it matched what the students were looking for,” he said. “We did a lot of surveys and asked students what they did enjoy and that’s what we came up with.”
As far as made-to-order items, Klinger said USC Hospitality priced the items based on competition and market values.
“We went around and looked at what others charged for similar or like sandwiches,” Klinger said. “We came up with what we believed [were] very fair prices based on what we’re charged.”
Both Roh and Lansky agreed that not knowing what goes into pricing make the costs seem artificially high.
“I just wonder how the price system goes. I want to know why it’s a little bit more expensive,” Roh said. “If we know the reason, it would be a little better.”
Although lower prices would be ideal, Lansky admitted that bringing costs down isn’t just a matter of changing price labels.
“I think they should lower the prices but considering the campus center was just built and I don’t really know what goes into setting prices, I doubt they’re just making it expensive for the sake of making it expensive,” she said.
Klinger said he is open to suggestions on how to lower prices, such as finding cheaper alternative grocery items, based on student demand.
“If it’s a made-to-order item we could get creative and possibly bring in a lower quality of meat or bread for instance, but we really didn’t want to skimp on quality,” he said.
In addition to maintaining quality of food, profits also contribute to the university and ultimately to students, he said.
“[USC Hospitality is] a revenue-generating entity but we run a zero-based budget, which means that the money that we do make goes right back into the university and its programs,” Klinger said. “If we do make any profit, it goes into funding of future growth of the department of auxiliaries or other departments throughout the university.”
I just wish Hospitality would be consistent in posting prices. Half the time, I pick up a product, and there’s no indication of the price. Given how different prices are from those in off-campus stores, I’m not about to guess. I end up not buying anything at all because I don’t want a nasty surprise at the register. 
As for options, we have Superior, Ralphs and Smart & Final to buy groceries.  They’re not Trader Joes, but it’s not the monopoly the article makes it out to be. And why are prices compared to Vons’ prices? Where is the nearest Vons?

There’s no doubt that last year’s 47-20 drubbing at Oregon was one of the worst losses in USC’s recent history.
Eyes up · Senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson tracks down a long pass in practice. Johnson said the team is in sync entering Saturday’s big game. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
With those same Ducks coming to town this weekend, most of the emphasis in USC’s practice has been placed on slowing down Oregon’s offense and the need for the Trojans offense to score on par with the Ducks. But one major adjustment the Trojans have made from last year that they believe will help them this weekend is that they are playing more as a team.
“I feel that we’re a better team this year than last year because there was a lot of players that were playing for themselves more than for the team,” senior running back Allen Bradford said. “I feel like this year everybody is a team, every break we have is a team, everyone feels like we’re doing it for a team and not individually. Just like that I think [this game] is not going be like that last year at all.”
Bradford said he felt players were more focused on playing for the NFL and for themselves last year rather than for each other.
“My past years with Cush, Rey and all those guys my freshman, sophomore, junior year, it felt like we were more of a team and then last year guys were just like, ‘I’m going to ball for myself and whatever happens,’” Bradford said.
He said USC coach Lane Kiffin has established a team-like mentality with everyone since spring practice and that the Trojans have grown together and gelled as a team. That attitude has helped the Trojans get through the two heartbreaking losses on last-second field goals this year, he said.
“[Kiffin] has definitely more of a team atmosphere, and last year it was more individualism,” senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson said.
When asked if this team atmosphere can help the Trojans avoid suffering a repeat of last year’s beating and help them win the game on Saturday, Johnson didn’t hesitate.
“Definitely,” he said. “We’re playing for one another now.”
—
If there’s a way to beat Oregon, Kiffin said to just look at the Arizona State game.
Although the 42-31 victory was the smallest winning margin for the year for the Ducks and the 42 points were the lowest they have scored this season, the main thing that stuck out to Kiffin was that the Sun Devils forced Oregon to punt 11 times.
“Arizona State’s defense going up against the No. 1 offense in the country … it was phenomenal what they did that day when you think about it,” Kiffin said. “If there is a blueprint how to play them, they did, but they just turned the ball over too much.”
Those turnovers are what hurt Arizona State in the end. The Sun Devils turned the ball over seven times, and the Trojans know they can’t give the Ducks more opportunities to score than they will already have.
“They do a good job getting the ball out,” senior fullback Stanley Havili said. “It’s going to help us win this game if we can keep the ball on our side.”
—
The Trojans are relishing their underdog role, something that was once rare for them. The last No. 1 team to come into the Coliseum was in 1988 when No. 1 Notre Dame played No. 2 USC — before most of the Trojan players had even been born.
“It feels great,” Johnson said. “I’m a senior. To knock these guys off it’s going to feel great.”
Kiffin said that the last three weeks, when a different No. 1 team has lost every time, show how hard it is to stay on top.
“I think back to being fortunate to be here [prior to leaving USC],” Kiffin said. “You take that for granted especially when you win 34 straight games. Now that you’re on the other side of that you see how focused your players are before you even say anything to them because they are playing the No. 1 team in the country.”

The USC men’s tennis team was on the verge of a sweep but instead came away with nothing at the ITA Southwest Regional Championships in Irvine, Calif., on Tuesday, losing in both the singles and doubles finals.

USC’s No. 2-seeded doubles team, consisting of junior Steve Johnson and freshman Ray Sarmiento, lost to the No. 1-seeded UCLA team of Amit Inbar and Nick Meister 9-7. The teams stayed locked in a tight battle for much of the match, and although Johnson and Sarmiento held a 6-5 lead, they could not maintain their advantage, dropping the next two games to trail 6-7. The Trojans managed to tie the match at 7-7, but UCLA swept the following two games to take the tournament.
“This was our first tournament playing together,” Johnson said of Sarmiento. “Overall it was a good experience and Ray left a good impression.”
In singles, No. 1 seed junior Daniel Nguyen cruised to the final without dropping a set, where he clashed with No. 4 seed Sebastian Fanselow of Pepperdine. The first set went to a tiebreaker, but Fanselow managed to edge Nguyen 7-6, before taking the second set, and the title, 6-3.
“[Nguyen] walked in struggling,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “But he played some really good tennis and finished as a better player on Monday than when he entered on Thursday.”
Despite the disappointing finish, the tournament started out well for the Trojans, with five singles players winning their first match in straight sets to advance to the round of 32. Three singles players and three doubles pairs moved on to the round of 16, and all three singles players moved on to the quarterfinals, capped by Sarmiento defeating Inbar 7-6, 6-4.
Sarmiento and senior Jaak Poldma fell to Pepperdine in the quarterfinals, leaving only Nguyen representing the Trojans in singles.
After knocking off UC Irvine’s Chris Kearney in the semifinals, Nguyen fell to Fanselow in the finals.
Poldma said that, despite the late losses, there were silver linings to be found.
“Other than the final matches, it was a nice tournament,” Poldma said. “This was the competition we needed before the [team] season starts. The team is looking good and is ready to be a contender again.”’
Smith said that he felt the same way.
“It was a good weekend for us,” Smith said. “We would have loved to win both finals on Monday, but it was a good reminder that championships are special.”
The Trojans did manage to come away with one title in the tournament, as freshman Michael Grant took the consolation singles crown 6-4, 6-3 over Thibaut Visy of the University of San Diego.
Solid team for the upcoming season just lost too much with Robert Farah leaving the program to reach the final four for the third straight year. He was the key to winning two national titles back to back.
