USC Libraries and the Marshall School of Business will launch a new online master’s degree of management in library and information science in May, making it one of the first programs in librarianship in the United States that is affiliated with a major business school.

According to Ken Haycock, research professor of management and organization at USC Marshall School of Business,  the degree was launched after USC Libraries Dean Catherine Quinlan approached James Ellis, the dean of Marshall to address the lack of leaders within the academy. Haycock was named the director of the graduate program.
“[Quinlan] wanted more people to exercise leadership within the academy,” Haycock said. “She was concerned that a program to create leaders for the libraries was not available and so she felt that the way the program would be configured would be with an emphasis in business, and that’s where the Marshall School of Business came in.”
The program aims to teach students the skills for effective information management. Haycock believes that skill will add value to any community.
“We are really looking to make students understand the whole life cycle of information and how it’s shared within the community,” Haycock said. “We think that our graduates will very much be able to add value in terms of information management.”
Admission for the program will be similar to most master’s programs, except there will be no GRE requirement.
Though the initial idea for the program was prompted by the need to produce more librarian leaders, Haycock emphasized that the program teaches skills that are useful outside the library, allowing graduates of the program to pursue careers in a variety areas.
“A good number of our graduates will want to work in the corporate setting, both for-profit and non-profit, so we know that our graduates’ careers will be much varied and quite interesting,” Haycock said. “They will be everything from family literacy coordinators to digital assets managers as well as library managers.”
Haycock said the interdisciplinary skills will serve them well in the future and also in other courses at the university.
“Students will have the ability to take a ‘user-centered’ approach to information management through team-based problem solving,” Haycock said. “They are going to gain a very strong knowledge of how information is generated, how it is evaluated and acquired, and how to package information for people so that it they can make good decisions. Our goal is to improve the quality of experiences that people have in the communities where they live and work.”
Students were generally positive about the introduction of the program. Kirubiel Ayele, a junior majoring in economics, considers the program to reflect  the importance of information while bringing librarianship into the limelight.
“The program looks interesting. The power of information is vital,” he said. “This would also make librarianship more mainstream.”
Aydin Celebi, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, is in favor of the program so long as it helps bring about change to the current system.
“I must admit at first I was skeptical about the idea. Still, when you look at the current system, there is massive room for change,” he said. “Even at USC, how many different searches do you have to do to get an academic journal? How hard is it to download an e-book version of a text? If this program helps push library managers to embrace the cloud and other technological advancements, then I’m all for this program.”

Hailed as the “bionic eye,” a retinal prosthesis system developed at USC has brought acclaim and attention after receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration last week. The retinal prosthesis system can restore partial vision to blind people suffering from certain degenerative eye diseases.

Mark Humayun, a professor of ophthalmology, biomedical engineering, cell and neurobiology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, was the principal developer of the system (dubbed Argus II), investing the past 25 years in the project. The idea came about when he began thinking of ways to help his grandmother, who was blind, because the approaches in medicine were of little help at the time. Later, he witnessed a procedure in which a patient saw a flash of color in response to electrical stimulation of the portion of the brain that controls vision.
“People around the world have called it the ‘bionic eye,’ but a better term would be an artificial retina, something that stimulates the remaining cells in the retina to send the information by the optic nerve,” said Humayun, who is also a retinal surgeon and biomedical engineer.
The system was approved to help treat patients afflicted with retinitis pigmentosa. Retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited condition that affects about 100,000 people in the United States, damages the light-sensing rod and cone cells in the retina, causing degeneration of vision and blindness.
Humayun said the condition usually begins with night blindness followed by loss of peripheral vision and then complete loss of vision, which usually occurs in the patient’s 50s or 60s. Only a small percentage of those affected with the condition lose their vision entirely, which is why the Argus II was approved as a Humanitarian Use Device, a designation given when less than 4,000 patients are expected to be treated per year.
The system — named after Argus, the giant in Greek mythology with 100 eyes — is manufactured by Second Sight Medical Products. It essentially replaces the damaged retina with a system of electrodes. These electrodes can interpret images sent by a camera mounted on a pair of glasses worn by the user.
“It encodes the information from the camera into neural code so the remaining cells can safely understand it and send it via the optic nerve to the brain, so the brain can understand it,” Humayun said. “We have to basically jumpstart the otherwise blind eye.”
The results have been astonishing. Patients using the Argus II can “see” a grayscale field that allows them to distinguish contours and perceive depth. Patients have experienced dramatic improvement in vision, including being able to read small letters held in their palm, make out chairs and tables and notice curbs and step over them.
“The exciting thing is being able to do things they haven’t been able to do in a long time,” Humayun said. “One of my patients was able to see the Fourth of July fireworks for the first time. Being able to see lights on a Christmas tree — things we take for granted — they haven’t been able to do for 30 years.”
Initial testing began in 1992 and Humayun placed the first implantable system, Argus I, with 16 electrodes, in a human patient in 2002 at USC. Humayun implanted the Argus II, with 60 electrodes, in the first U.S. patient in 2007. In 2011 it was approved as a medical device in Europe, and finally, this year, in the United States.
Humayun said the development was largely a collaborative effort involving 30 faculty members from 20 institutions in both the United States and abroad, several national laboratories and over 200 students over the years. The initial key players were fellow professor James Weiland and former graduate student Rob Greenberg, who became the CEO of Second Sight Medical Products.
“This is definitely not a one-man show,” Humayun said. “Something like this requires a lot of synergy and a large team effort.”
Humayun said his role has evolved from initially doing almost everything, from research to engineering, to primarily guiding and teaching. He has traveled extensively, training surgeons on how to implant the Argus device.
Looking ahead, Humayun said they are hoping, among other things, to improve the digital software for the device to give patients better quality of vision. Additionally, Second Sight is looking to develop a device that can be implanted directly in the brain for patients whose retinas have degenerated completely.
“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Humayun said. “This technology is just starting.”

A panel that included former chancellor of the Washington, D.C. public schools and StudentsFirst founder Michelle Rhee took a close look at some of the biggest problems facing education in the Golden State and also considered viable solutions to a system that ranks among the lowest in the nation.
Radical reform · Michelle Rhee, Catherine Shieh and Ben Austin (right to left) debates the challenges facing California public schools. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The  Wednesday panel was part of Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics’ Students Talk Back series, this one with focus on education reform in the state of California.
Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur moderated the panel, which included USC College Democrats finance director Catherine Shieh and USC College Republicans member Haran Sivakumar, both of whom spoke about education reform from a student perspective, and Ben Austin, a former member of the California State Board of Education and founder of reform group Parent Revolution.
The discussion began with an overview of the type of policy environments that foster productive reform in education. Rhee’s organization, which is committed to reforming American public education, recently gave California an ‘F’ on its national report card. Rhee emphasized that states that are willing to cross party lines and work toward nonpartisan reform strengthen their education systems. She cited Massachusetts as one such example.
“Massachusetts usually ranks among the highest in the nation when it comes to education,” Rhee said. “StudentsFirst gave it a ‘D+’ grade because of its inefficient policy environment. Instead of rejecting the criticism, state legislators saw it as an opportunity for improvement, and have been working towards closing the state’s achievement gap.”
Throughout the discussion, however, the theme of legislative inaction remained dominant. Shieh, whose internship for a congressman included serving as a field representative to the U.S. Department of Education on his behalf, emphasized the lack of dialogue taking place between teachers and policymakers. Austin agreed that when it comes to education, power is in the wrong hands.
“This type of politics is too important to be left up to the politicians,” Austin said.
Austin was instrumental in the passage of California’s 2010 parent trigger law, which allows the parents of children in underperforming schools to bring in new teachers and leadership, or even vote to turn the school in to a charter school.
“Parent trigger is a transfer of power from the legislators who are upholding the status quo to the parents, whose chief concern is the children,” Austin said.
Sivakumar voiced the frustration of many by questioning the funding priorities of the state, which ranks fourth-highest in teacher pay but does not have the student performance data to match.
“How long can we look to increase tax revenue to fund a system that is completely broken?” Sivakumar said.
Panelists stressed the importance of the education issue, and encouraged college students to get involved in reaching the solution.

Who are these “many”? How does CA teacher pay compare to cost of living? Is it reasonable to assume there should be a correlation or a causal relationship between teacher pay and student test scores? What are the main determinants of student test scores anyways? 
Here’s the scoop: the strongest influences on student test scores are non-school factors. And if it turns out that the challenges of poverty, health care costs for personnel, transportation, facilities, energy, etc., are all really high, then, yes, we may need more money to run schools and pay teachers a living wage. And California is already at or near the bottom compared to other states when it comes to providing librarians, nurses, counselors, aides and site administrators.  Teachers in other developed countries earn salaries comparable to engineers and doctors, by the way. 
> “How long can we look to increase tax revenue to fund a system that is completely broken?” Sivakumar said.
The system is not completely broken. Let me repeat: the system is NOT completely broken. Schools in high poverty areas are certainly coping with all that their students confront in their lives. To the extent that the system needs improvement, most of it will cost money. We’re struggling because we’ve already cut, and cut, and cut, and cut. All that’s left to do is shorten the school year. Meanwhile schools that have low levels of poverty to address are doing well. About 90% of California’s students are in public schools, and we’re filling up our colleges and universities with capable students. Could we do better? Of course? Completely broken? Not at all.
And I’ll bet the supposed “experts” on education on this panel let that statement go by, didn’t they? Because it suits their political goals to present a system in dire need of their preferred fixes. What has Rhee fixed? In the little time she had, she accomplished nothing educationally – at least nothing you can believe because the test scores were highly suspicious according to independent analysis and some highly reputable journalists who’ve dug into the story. Rhee effectively slowed the investigation and shows none of her usual swagger and brash attitude when it comes time to pass the buck for what happened on her watch. What about the parent trigger? It has touched a grand total of three schools in California. In the first case, Parent Revolution staff presented themselves as community members to bring in signatures. A judge threw out that petition on technicalities. In the second case, parents circulated two petitions at the same time, claiming one was the backup for the other, and then pulling a bait-and-switch. In all cases, apparently if the parent trigger petition succeeds at starting a change, only the parents who signed retain any voice or vote in the next steps. Is that empowerment? What about the community itself: are parents of current students the only ones who deserve a say in the governance of a public institution operated for the public good using all of our taxes?
All in all, this sounds like a pretty embarrassingly one-sided presentation and over-simplification of complex education policy. Who benefits? Hmmm… the panelists, their organization’s funders, the funders of the event… not the general public, or the USC student seeking better information about California public education.

USC is ranked fourth in fundraising among American colleges and universities for 2012, according to an annual survey by the Council for Aid to Education.
The university raised $492 million last year.
Stanford University is ranked first in the survey, having raised more than $1.03 billion in one year. It is the first university to raise more than $1 billion in a single year. Harvard University and Yale University were ranked second, with $650 million, and third, with $544 million, respectively.
In August 2011, USC launched a multi-year campaign to raise $6 billion or more to increase endowments in support of faculty and provide support for academic priorities, capital projects and infrastructure. The campaign is calling upon individual donors, foundations and corporations to contribute to this effort, as well as to alumni, faculty, staff, community members and families to spread the word.
A recent contribution was made by philanthropist Glorya Kaufman, who endowed the USC Kaufman School of Dance in November 2012, funding the creation of the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center. The school is the first to be created by endowment in 40 years and will be the sixth school of the arts at USC.
Donors may contribute through faculty and research program endowments, student scholarships and capital projects.
Recent contributors include USC alumni David Dollinger, Bryan Singer, Sumner Redstone,   and Michele Dedeaux Engemann.
According to the campaign’s website, USC has already raised $2.35 billion from 179,731 donors as of Feb. 8.

Provost Elizabeth Garrett said Wednesday that the search for Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson’s successor has begun. Jackson announced on Feb. 11 he will step down on June 30 after 18 years of service.
President C. L. Max Nikias requested Garrett send out an email explaining the process of hiring the new vice provost for Student Affairs rather than a vice president for Student Affairs. The search committee will consist of Vice President of Admissions and Planning Katherine Harrington, Marshall School of Business Dean Jim Ellis, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers, current USG President Michael Geragos, current Graduate Student Government president Yael Adef and eight other members.
Faculty from the Marshall School of Business, the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the School of Dramatic Arts, the Keck School of Medicine, the Price School of Public Policy and the Viterbi School of Engineering will be involved in the selection process.
The committee will not be tasked with voting on the future Vice Provost. Rather, the decision will be made by Garrett, according to the email. The search committee will discuss everyone nominated for the position, and committee members’ comments on candidates’ interviews will be sent directly to Garrett.
The search will also be aided by consultants from Storbeck/Pimentel & Associates LP. The provost invited students to participate in the process and assured students that they would be kept informed.
Jackson is leaving to take a one-year sabbatical, after which he will return to USC as emeritus vice president and executive director of International Advancement. Jackson will continue to serve as a professor at the Rossier School of Education.
We will miss you Dr. Jackson–thanks for all the great things you did to make the student experience memorable.
I only hope that the student voice will be the strongest one considered in selecting our new Student Affairs leader!
Why even have a search committee?  The Dictator will be making all the decisions.

The USC women’s basketball team lost its seventh straight game on Tuesday night, falling 68-54 against No. 17 UCLA at the Galen Center.
Poor showing · USC shot just 28.3 percent against UCLA. — Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
USC (8-18, 5-10 Pac-12), which has lost 10 out of its last 11 games after starting Pac-12 play 4-0, was dominated by the Bruins from the start and trailed by as many as 27 points.
“UCLA came out and played extremely well, and I don’t think that we came out and played as hard as we should have,” USC head coach Michael Cooper said.
The Women of Troy were plagued by mistakes on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. USC had 21 turnovers, four more than their season average of 17. UCLA, however, was only able to produce 12 points off that large amount of turnovers.
The team shot a combined 28.3 percent from the field, making only 17 of 60 shots over the course of the game. That stood in stark contrast to the Bruins, who shot 42.5 percent from the field. USC was also dismal from long range, shooting 2-18 from the three-point arc for 11.1 percent shooting. In contrast, UCLA shot a solid 4-10 for 40 percent from three-point distance.
There wasn’t much of an equal distribution for USC scoring-wise, as junior forward Cassie Harberts led the team with 17 points along with nine rebounds, barely missing out on a double-double. Sophomore guard Kiki Alofaituli dropped in 11 points of her own, while sophomore guard Ariya Cook really struggled to find her groove, shooting a rough 4-19 from the field for only 10 points. Besides those three, no other player finished with more than seven points.
The Women of Troy did not help themselves out on the boards either, being outrebounded by the Bruins, 49-40. USC also allowed a staggering 22 second-chance points off of 21 offensive rebounds.
“We had some collapses on defense and they killed us on the offensive boards that led to a lot of second chance points,” senior forward Christina Marinacci said.
UCLA (20-6, 11-4) was led by forward Atonye Nyingfia, who had 22 points off a very efficient 11-14 shooting. The Bruins had two other players in double figures, as guard Thea Lemberger added 12 points, while forward Jasmine Dixon put in 10 points.
Efficiency was the name of the game for the Bruins coming off two tough losses against Cal and Stanford, as 44 of their 68 points came in the paint.
“Without guards knocking down shots from the outside, the paint then opens up for our frontline and those feeds to our post players become easier, allowing for easy shots closer to the basket,” UCLA head coach Cori Close said.
The Bruins led USC from the start and never compromised that lead, taking a 34-19 advantage at halftime. They pulled ahead by as many as 27 points in the second half before USC finally picked up the defense through a full-court press. Another bright spot for the Women of Troy was their ability to get to the free-throw line, shooting 18 of 27 from the charity stripe. UCLA only shot two of six, making for a large disparity in the free-throw department.
“This is another loss that we are going to have to overcome,” Cooper said. “We are going to make our adjustments for Sunday’s game and I think that it is going to be more effort than anything. We will have a better game plan and a bigger surprise for them going there.”
After being swept by the Women of Troy last year, UCLA looks to return the favor to USC, as they try to complete the sweep at home on Sunday at Pauley Pavilion in Westwood. Tipoff is set for 2 p.m.
Totally agree with the above that Cooper needs his walking paper after the last game of the season. How
many years can you fool the athletic dept with no results . Hope they were proud of the staggering attendance
figure of 706 against your crosstown rival. The program has reached bottom. His statements are so lame you
have to laugh. What an embarrassment with some of the great players in WOT history being honored at the
game.
cooper should be fired.  he is awful.

The USC men’s golf team overcame an eight-stroke deficit during Wednesday’s final round to capture a share of the Prestige Tournament title. The squad finished tied atop the leaderboard with Pac-12 rival and second round leader No. 7 Washington.
Sophomore standout Anthony Paolucci paced the No. 8 Trojans, posting a 1-under par 70 in each of his three rounds to finish in a three-way tie for second place individually.
It was junior Ramsey Sahyoun, however, who overcame a poor second round to lead the Trojans to the top of the leaderboard on Wednesday. Sahyoun’s final round of 68 led a USC squad with three other players finishing under par, including Paolucci, junior Jeffrey Kang and freshman Yi Keun Chang.
The 15 participating teams at the PGA West Course in La Quinta, Calif., were exposed to the curse of early-season darkness throughout the tourney. Paolucci was only able to complete 15 of his scheduled 18 holes Tuesday before play was suspended, and he was forced to play three extra holes on Wednesday. The Trojans escaped a similar fate in Monday’s opening round, when seven of 15 competing squads could not finish golfing before darkness overtook the course.
The rush to beat the night seemed to help USC’s squad on day one. The Trojans posted an impressive 5-under 279 collectively, finishing just a single stroke behind round leader Texas Christian University. Paolucci, Chang and Kang all had strong performances. The trio landed in the individual top-15 for the round, and Kang’s 4-under 67 was good for a share of the round lead.
Day two of the tournament, however, was a different story. The team slid to fifth place, 10 strokes behind leader and Pac-12 rival No. 5 UCLA. Paolucci’s strong effort, good enough to raise him to fourth place individually, was not enough to make up for less than stellar days from the rest of the squad. USC head coach Chris Zambri was disappointed with a lack of consistency.
“We have had some fine play,” Zambri said. “But we have made way too many mistakes to be leading.”
In the final round of play, USC sought to come from behind and add another top-five finish to its resume. Sahyoun’s improvement and Paolucci’s consistency certainly helped accomplish that goal, leading the team to a collective 6-under 278 on day three.
Adding that score to day one’s 279 helped overcome a rough 10-over 294 on Tuesday.
“The guys stayed positive today after a rough second round,” Zambri said. “Coach Wurzer and I are so proud of them for that. They played like champs today.”
The team returns to action next week at Westlake Village’s North Ranch Intercollegiate.

If you told me a year ago that Matt Barkley wasn’t going to throw at the NFL Scouting Combine, I wouldn’t have batted an eye. Former top picks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III also decided against showing off their arms at the league’s annual scouting bonanza, and it has been a popular choice among quarterbacks in past years to refrain as well.
But when news came out this weekend that Barkley’s record-setting right arm would be out of commission, I couldn’t help but shake my head.
Barkley still hasn’t fully healed from a separated right shoulder, casting further doubt on his status as an NFL prospect. Though he was once a lock to be the first pick in the draft, most analysts don’t rank the Pac-12’s all-time leader in touchdown passes among this year’s top-30 prospects.
What a difference a year makes.
Perhaps the All-American can recover from this setback and have a prosperous NFL career. Last season notwithstanding, Barkley excelled throughout his high school and college playing days and surely has the potential to do so at the professional level.
But when a player’s draft stock falls as far as Barkley’s has, one has to wonder whether or not he will serve as a cautionary tale against turning down millions to return to school instead of bolting for the NFL.
Barkley had many noble reasons to return to school last winter. He wanted a chance to play in a bowl game, to finish what he started in resurrecting a program that had been hammered by sanctions. He wanted to win a national championship, and he decided that the NFL could wait.
Call it bad luck, but since making that decision, every potential risk has become a reality: USC had one of the worst seasons as a team in recent memory and, even before his injury, Barkley’s play slipped enough to cause a noticeable dip in his draft evaluation. By the end of the season, you would be hard-pressed to find anybody who thought his decision to return was a smart one.
I understand that had USC won more games and Barkley played better, his choice would be viewed differently. But in hindsight, I don’t see how any player can turn down the type of sure-fire money that Barkley did in future years. It seems that this line of thinking is at least beginning to creep into the minds of some potential future top prospects.
Recently, rumors began to spread that University of South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney had considered sitting out next season in order to prepare for the 2014 NFL draft and avoid the risk of getting injured. Clowney is currently a sophomore and therefore ineligible for this year’s draft, though many believe that, if he were eligible, he would be the consensus first pick.
This idea of getting out while you can is nothing new. Last year’s draft saw a record 65 players declare early, eclipsing the previous record of 56, which was set in 2011. In 2004, Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett and USC wide receiver Mike Williams attempted to declare for the draft after their sophomore seasons and were disallowed. Because the pair had already signed agents, they were also deemed ineligible to play their junior seasons of college football.
Now, most would counter these examples with the infamous JaMarcus Russell, the first pick in the 2007 NFL draft and one of the most notable draft “busts” of all time. Russell left Lousiana State University one year early and made just 25 career starts in the NFL before being released.
To most, his case is evidence that players should not leave college until they’re ready, and this idea definitely makes sense. But the way I see it, JaMarcus Russell was never going to be ready to play in the NFL. At least he made that clear only after signing his $61-million contract.
I know the benefits of returning to school instead of going to the draft: the possibility of BCS glory, the chance to refine your skills and just one more year of being the big man on campus are all enticing. But to me, the risk outweighs the reward.
Barkley’s decision to come back was, in many ways, a selfless act. But because he chose to return, the lasting image of Barkley at USC will be of him standing on the sidelines in street clothes as the team that he turned down millions to play for embarrassed itself against Georgia Tech in El Paso, Texas. He deserved better than that, and I hope that the cautionary tale of Barkley will someday turn into a comeback story for the ages.

I thought I read somewhere that Barkley’s family purchased insurance against this type of loss.  If not, why not??
I agree with JD, but unfortunately that’s what I call naive optimism, the “foolish martyr,” and what have you. The ways of the world are cruel, and rarely do feel-good, underdog stories come true.
I kind of thought, as a premonition, that SC would get its comeuppance for posting that billboard in Westwood, “we pLAy to win.” We lost against teams we shouldn’t have…But I do hope the best for Barkley.
From what I can tell of Barkley’s character, though he has had huge disappointments, football is not the most important thing in life. He has earned the respect and admiration of so many. He single handedly has brought a measure of respect to the current USC football program and much respect for USC as a whole. I have no doubt all will work out just fine for Matt, including NFL football, if that is what he wants.
Unless the Trojan fanbase really wants to live up to the stereotype of the “University of Spoiled Children,” Barkley’s lasting image won’t be his disappointing senior season. His lasting image will be that of a young man who chose not only to stand by this program during its darkest days, but to be the unflinching public face of it. He was a strong and composed leader through the sanctions, and when the bowl ban was over and he had a chance to leave and make millions at a time when no one could possibly blame him for doing so, he chose again to stay. If the fans have any sense of respect for this program’s heroes, then Barkley should and will be remembered as one of the greatest Trojans of all time. Not because of his stats, but because of his leadership and character.

The USC men’s volleyball team has a final chance to atone for its struggles on its current homestand, as it takes on UC Santa Barbara at the Galen Center on Thursday.
Pushing back · Sophomore Ben Lam (above) and the Trojans have 14 regular season games remaining after a disappointing start to the season. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The match marks the fourth home game in eight days for the Trojans. The homestand started on a positive note, as the Trojans beat Cal Baptist to notch their third win, but back-to-back losses at the hands of Brigham Young University and UCLA dropped USC to a 3-7 record overall in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation competition.
“We always talk about a process, and part of that is having a higher level of intensity when we begin the match,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “We tend to start slow, and I think part of it is that we have so many young guys who maybe weren’t part of the last four years of our success.”
Though the Trojans do not lack talent, inexperience has been a constant issue for Ferguson, whose club has already exceeded the number of losses from last year’s championship-finalist squad. Still, Ferguson maintains that his team is both highly regarded and competitive each night.
“The success that we’ve had over the last four years has come against most of the teams in the league,” Ferguson said. “Not only do teams normally get up to play USC, but there’s always a little bit extra behind what everybody brings to the table when they come to our gym or we go to theirs.”
The Trojans fended off Cal Baptist in four sets Thursday on the strength of a dominant offensive performance. Redshirt junior opposite Tanner Jansen, arguably the team’s most steady contributor, led the way with 14 kills and seven digs, while sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers (12 kills) and redshirt freshman outside hitter Austin Rysyk (11) also hit double figures.
While the Trojans were able to put away the Lancers despite being outhit and outblocked, the team failed to see similar success against two premier MPSF opponents this weekend. After falling 3-1 to BYU on Saturday, the Trojans were swept 3-0 Monday (25-18, 25-21, 25-17) to crosstown rival UCLA. Though the Bruins recorded a better hitting percentage (.522 to .338) and more blocks (6.5 to 4.0), they also notched seven service aces, while USC failed to record one.
“We do a good job of executing our game plan, but we need to improve our blocking and digging,” Ferguson said. “We were doing very well defensively and not so well offensively [last week], but in the last few matches it’s been flipped.”
A victory Thursday will be crucial before the Trojans embark on a four-game road trip spanning nine days.
“From an age and experience standpoint, our team makeup is younger, and I don’t mean to say that as an excuse,” Ferguson said. “Most of our older leadership hasn’t been on the floor. We’re getting it back, and we played [sophomore] Joey Booth and [junior] Henry Cassiday Monday. That will settle things down, because the inexperience has been the major difference for us.”
After hosting UCSB Thursday, the Trojans will have an extended break before visiting Pacific on March 2 to kick off the road trip.

Just about everything was frozen at Dedeaux Field on Wednesday night.
Fans, media, broadcasters —and bats.
Just enough · Junior shortstop James Roberts (above) finished 0-3 against Loyola Marymount, but the Trojans got help from junior designated hitter Jake Hernandez (2-4) and senior second baseman Adam Landecker (2-3). – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
It looked for a long time like neither team would ever push a runner across home plate, and neither did until the seventh inning. Then, with USC and Loyola Marymount tied at one in the eighth, senior center fielder Greg Zebrack led off with an infield single and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by junior shortstop James Roberts. With two outs, freshman right fielder Vahn Bozoian bounced a ball past the Lions’ third baseman and into left field, scoring Zebrack from second for what proved to be the winning run.
True freshman pitcher Kyle Davis came on to get the last three outs in the ninth, having pitched 2 2/3 scoreless innings in Sunday’s 4-3 win over Nebraska. He dispatched the Lions in quick fashion, allowing just one runner on an infield hit.
“Kyle did what we expect him to,” USC coach Dan Hubbs said, showing tremendous confidence in his young closer. “He’s comfortable out there in the big spot.”
Scoring was far from plentiful for the majority of the game. For six innings, USC and Loyola Marymount battled in a scoreless contest, with just five combined runners reaching as far as second base.
Trojans starter Brent Wheatley threw five shutout innings in his collegiate debut but was outdone by Lions starter Patrick McGrath, who threw six.
“I could have gone four more (innings),” Wheatley said emphatically. “But I’m thrilled with the start. It was awesome.”
In the top of the seventh, the Lions put runners at the corners with one down against senior reliever Matt Munson. LMU left fielder Mitchell Esser laid down a swinging bunt that traveled no more than 15 feet up the third baseline. USC sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs could have let it roll foul, but instead chose to pounce on the ball, hoping to tag out the oncoming utility Kevin Garcia from third base. But Stubbs couldn’t pick up the ball cleanly, and when he finally did Garcia had already leapt over him for the game’s first run.     The Trojans played small ball of their own to get the run back in the bottom of the seventh. Junior third baseman Kevin Swick led off with a walk, advanced to second on a bunt and to third on a wild pitch. Senior second baseman Adam Landecker brought him in with a liner down the left field line for an RBI double.
“It was huge to get that run back,” Hubbs said. “We’ve talked over and over about being able to answer after they score and being able to shut down after we score. And we did those both today.”
Between Wheatley, Davis and Bozoian, the Trojans had all freshmen collecting the win, the save and the game-winning hit, respectively.
“Well, we do have 16 of them,” Hubbs joked. “And we’ve got plenty more who we’ve got to find times to get in games.”
The Trojans are a young team, especially on the mound. Freshman Kyle Twomey started for USC on Sunday. Of the nine pitchers to have taken the mound for the Trojans this year, five are freshmen. The Trojans start a pair of freshmen in the outfield as well in Bozoian and Timmy Robinson, with Turner Clouse mixed in at times, too.
“This freshman group is a really tight group,” Wheatley said. “We’ve got a lot of great players, too, but more importantly we’re really close and we’re always pushing each other and rooting for each other.”
With just one day off before the weekend, more freshmen figure to see action when the Trojans take on Cal State Northridge in a three-game set starting Friday. The series will start at Dedeaux Field on Friday before moving to Northridge on Saturday and finally returning to Dedeaux for the finale on Sunday, where Twomey will be on the mound.

It could be heartbreak or romance: A couple, sitting on a park bench discuss whether they should break up or get married. Deciding on the latter, the man proposes, using a ring that was previously thrown into the trash can. The couple kisses and walks off into the sunset. The audience gets ready to applaud — but the scene is not over yet. A homeless woman  walks out, her hands lingering on the rim of the trash can. She looks out to an unknown point in the audience and begins to sing.

“Never mind, I’ll find, someone like you,” she belts Adele out to the now empty park. Only when she finishes her song does the audience begin to applaud, somewhat hesitantly at first, unsure now how to feel about the conclusion to “Swans,” the first play performed in Plays in the Park, a mix of short plays, Shakespeare and songs, now running the Promenade Playhouse.
Was the homeless woman intended to serve as a cipher or was she merely an interlude between acts? It is hard to tell. That ambiguity might be just what Brian Connors, the writer and director of the production, was going for. Plays in the Park explores the common themes of commitment, trust and betrayal, but the plays never leave the audience with the satisfaction of a clean ending.
The first performance of the night, the aforementioned play, “Swans,” begins with the couple fighting because the woman, Suzanne (Tiffany Kieu), a professional dancer, wants to get married and have a baby, but she is worried that her lover, an artist named Bill (Fabien Luszezysyzn), won’t be able to financially support their life together. Kieu delivers a strong debut performance as Suzanne, a Rockettes dancer. Her lithe movements and compelling eye contact draws the audience into the fight that the couple is having.
Luszezysyzn, meanwhile, utilizes his European charm to play the suave, starving artist, Bill. But Suzanne’s boyfriend has doubts of his own. He is worried that by getting married he will lose his creative freedom and get shackled down by his in-laws.
The couple clearly cares for one another, but they also understand that respective aspects of each other’s lives will cause them discomfort in the long run. Though the couple decides that it is better to suffer together, when the act ends, the issues that set up their fight are still looming between them. Who knows what the future will bring for them? Is the right decision for two artists with little income to get married and bring a child into the world?
The actors do a good job leaving the audience with food for thought. Though there are moments in the play where both Kieu and Luszezysyzn feel like they are reading straight from the script, overall, they manage to pull together strong performances. One is left rooting for them to end up together, though curious what their lives will be like five years from now.
Each of the four short plays does that, providing some closure but leaving the audience with some ambiguity. Of all the plays,though, “Oxymorons” might be the one that resonates the most with the audience. Two brothers with very different lifestyles meet up at the park zoo. One, Joey (Ralph Radebaugh) is a brash businessman who recently suffered a huge financial loss. The other, J (John Jester), is a mellower, more modest individual. One gets the sense, however, that he might have settled in life — that he could have gotten more from it if he tried. Though Jester’s character, J, gets somewhat lost in the background during Joey’s rhetoric, because his character is mellower, it is understandable that his performance feels at times more muted.
During the play, as the brothers watch a neurotic polar bear pace back and forth, Joey explains his financial woes. At first, he comes off as shallow and spoiled.
However, after he starts talking about his business (a citrus farm in Florida that was devastated by an early frost) and how his insurance refused to pay for the damages (because the insurance company had demanded a sky-high premium for him to be protected by an early frost), he becomes a more sympathetic character.
Radebaugh does a good job making Joey real and accessible for the audience. It would be easy to paint him as foolish for choosing not to spend the money to buy insurance for his crops, but the issue is more complex than that. (“They’re happy to sell you flood insurance in the desert,” Radebaugh says bitterly as Joey, voicing his frustration with the system.) Is the crop failure entirely his fault, or is the system itself the factor really at fault? Is he just an unfortunate pawn in a larger game?
As the polar bear continues to pace, J does his best to console Joey, it is clear that the two brothers could not be more different with their life philosophies, and there is nothing J can say that will get through to his brother. the scene eventually ends, with neither brother able to see things from the other’s point of view.
More so than the plays themselves, the most memorable part of the night is the incorporation of Shakespeare soliloquies and contemporary music.  The elements are really what makes the short plays stand out and give the production as a whole a fresh, edgy feel.
Despite the interesting dynamic though, the only problem with the music and Shakespeare  prose is that they feel, at times, thrown in for no reason.
In a production that is thematically about the ambiguity of life, it is hard to criticize elements in it for being too ambiguous. Nevertheless, the music and Shakespeare sometimes comes off as a little bit too much of a non sequitur, making the production as a whole feel too disjointed.
Still, the elements succeed in establishing an interesting, thoughtful vibe. When the final play “Marcia and Marcus,” finishes, Leah Ludwig (who plays Marcia) comes out and sings “Please Don’t Leave Me” by the artist Pink.
The words drive home the anger that the final play carries and leaves the audience with something extra.
One might not always understand the meaning behind all of the elements in Plays in the Park, but as a whole, they  provoke emotion — and at the end of the day, that is what matters when one leaves the theater.
Plays in the Park will run from Feb. 16 to March 23 Saturday nights at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. The show is approximately 120 minutes with intermission.
Tickets: $20.00 – All performances $5.00 discount for seniors and students.

This Sunday marks the 85th Academy Awards, which means that the annual race for best picture will finally come to an end.
All things considered, it’s been a pretty good year for film. The artsy Beasts of the Southern Wild holds rank with the conservative Lincoln. The awkwardly funny Silver Linings Playbook is keeping up the visually stunning Life of Pi. And with foreign film Amour vying for the same title as musical Les Misérables, this Oscar season is a hodgepodge of premier cinema.
But as viewers tune in Sunday night, crossing their fingers and waiting to see if their favorites will take home that coveted award, it’s important to remember where several of these films have drawn their inspiration — namely, from original novels.
Admittedly, some films, such as Beasts of the Southern Wild, were taken from plays or other art forms, but a wide majority of the films nominated for best picture have roots in the literary world.
Ang Lee’s Life of Pi is a direct adaptation of Yann Martel’s novel of the same name. Steven Spielberg merged historical reimaginings with Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. Victor Hugo’s 1862 novel Les Misérables inspired the successful musical which led, in turn, to a film that dominated the Golden Globes. And though Ben Affleck certainly brought his own directorial vision to Argo, the film was based on former CIA Agent Antonio Mendez’s recollections in The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA as well as an article in WIRED magazine.
Needless to say, it’s hard to imagine Hollywood without the book industry.
With this in mind, movie-lovers should take the time to read through a film’s source material. Though there might not always be time to read the original novel before the film’s release — reading Leo Tolstoy’s 800-page Anna Karenina would prove challenging for anyone — even catching up on a text after you’ve seen the movie proves rewarding.
For some cinephiles, exploring a story through an alternate art form offers a way to re-experience an on-screen narrative. As characters take new life on the blank page, readers ultimately deepen their understandings of the events portrayed on screen.
Lovers of Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series explore the intricacies of Lisbeth Salander after Rooney Mara’s 2011 Oscar-worthy performance, and Potterheads continually fluctuate between J.K. Rowling’s original characters and the Warner Bros. adaptations. Undoubtedly, reading provides a continuation of a cinematic story that’s just aching to be re-explored.
Then, of course, reading the original source material also offers explanations for some of Hollywood’s biggest on-screen departures. That is, movies that seem only rough translations of their literary counterparts.
Silver Linings Playbook, for example, might be up for eight Academy Awards, including best original adapted screenplay, but it bears little resemblance to Matthew Quick’s text. Bradley Cooper’s Pat is nearly identical to Quick’s original vision, but Jennifer Lawrence adds a certain feistiness to Tiffany that’s not as present on the page. Quick’s Tiffany is a firecracker to be sure, but she’s also a bit more vulnerable, allowing herself to openly confess her love to Pat in the book’s final chapters. (In the film, Pat reasons out Tiffany’s affections by deducing that she forged a letter from Nikki.)
But these changes seem minor when compared to some of the film’s other alterations. In the original novel, Pat’s father is hardly Robert De Niro’s superstitious nutcase. He rarely speaks to his son and doesn’t even make it to Pat and Tiffany’s final dance-off. There’s also no final parlay based on the outcomes of the dance competition and the Eagles game. There’s no public explosion between Pat and Tiffany on their “date” at the diner. And, as an unexpected change, Pat never holds another conversation with Nikki.
That’s not to say that the film’s changes ruin Quick’s novel. The inclusion of Chris Tucker, for example, represents a sharp improvement from Quick’s rather shallow and stereotypical depiction of Danny. Whereas Pat in the novel repeatedly refers to Danny as “[his] black friend,” a term which implies a problematic racial categorization, Cooper’s Pat views Danny as more of an equal — one who remains in his life long after they leave the mental hospital. Tucker’s Danny is ultimately more fleshed out with his addictive personality and determination to make the best of his illness. The best Quick can come up with, it seems, is to link Danny’s mental breakdown to a failed career as a rap artist.
Still, it’s not hard to see why writer-director David O. Russell might have made some serious changes in his interpretation of Quick’s novel. After all, the original Silver Linings Playbook sets itself up so nicely for cinematic adaptation. In addition to a chapter of the novel where Quick breaks Pat’s thoughts into a series of filmic montages, Silver Linings Playbook remains obsessed with the formulaic happy ending of a typical Hollywood comedy. Indeed, as he struggles to win over Nikki, Pat lives by the philosophy that “life is like a series of movies.”
“… My own life is the movie I will watch, and well, it’s always on,” Pat tells his therapist, Dr. Patel. “Plus I know it’s almost time for the happy ending, when Nikki will come back, because I have improved myself so very much through physical fitness and medication and therapy.”
Pat’s vision of the happy conclusion to his trials only adds another element to his “silver lining” ideology, one enhanced by a cinematic adaptation of his story. This extra layer, however, would be lost on anyone who hadn’t read Quick’s original novel.
So before — or perhaps, after — Sunday’s award ceremony, take the time to get lost on a lifeboat at sea with Martel, perform in a dance competition with Quick or raft through a New Orleans Bayou with Lucy Alibar.
As you probe the deeper meaning of these stories and uncover more details about these cherished characters, you might just be glad you did.

I completely agree that the nominees are all over the place, but I didn’t know that so many of the nominated films are based on books. I’ve been spending so much time at my office at DISH that I haven’t had any free time to go see any of these films in theater. Reading the book versions sounds nice, but I think I’m going to stick with just adding them to my Blockbuster @Home queue that I have set up through DISH. They have all the nominated films like Life of Pi and Silver Linings Playbook available to add now so I don’t have to remember to add them later when they’re finally released on disc.

Kate Moss is to 21st century fashion what Audrey Hepburn was to the 20th century. If Kate Moss wears it, then “it” is automatically stylish. For fashionistas, her word on a designer or store is pretty much final.
Haute or cold · Topshop recently opened its first West Coast location at The Grove. The store, which is known for its cutting-edge, affordable styles, but disappointed fans with its selection of predictable and pricey clothing. — Courtesy of Amanda Ellis
So when the famous supermodel started both donning and designing clothes for the uber-cool — and uber-cheap — London hotspot Topshop, the rest of the world stood captivated and waited for the chain to expand.
It seemed to have everything: cute and chic styles made for the fashion-obsessed maven. By buying various items and mixing and matching all of them, truly fashionable girls could rise to the creative top. After a fiercely long wait, the Brits finally brought it to SoHo in Manhattan, and the three-story superstore was an instant hit. Something clearly got lost in translation, however, when distributors decided to open up a store in Los Angeles.
The billboards taunted fashionistas for close to a year: TOPSHOP SPRING 2013. There couldn’t be a better location, The Grove. There couldn’t be a better time. But, unfortunately, when it opened on Feb. 14, it could not have been more of a disappointment to those with high hopes.
Shopping can be either relaxing or stressful, and Los Angeles’ Topshop falls into the latter category. Though business is busy since the store just opened, there is no excuse for the frenzied atmosphere that a better layout of the store could have mitigated. Clothes are situated awkwardly on the first floor, with no organization according to style, item of clothing or color. It seems as if Topshop is taking the idea of Throw-on-Chic to heart.
If one is tired of the mid-sized ground floor, all they have to do is venture upstairs to an even smaller second floor. Hopefully, the escalator won’t break down — again.
Understandably, employees must be busy with the new store and copious customers, but when there are employees standing outside giving out Lookbook Magazines instead of keeping things neat and organized inside, a store runs into a problem.
Simple things such as layout and customer service could be overlooked if the items in the store can live up to a positive image. Too bad that even the clothes disappoint. What happened to the hip Kate Moss style that devotees have come to love? In place of actually fashionable things are an assortment of muscle tanks in seemingly every color, bandage skirts and bustier dresses. A small section of “fancy” dresses looked promising before it became apparent that the cost is far too high for the quality of fabric.
A store’s continued success relies on its ability to turn out clothes that continue to excite and entice customers. Or, if you’re Topshop, after too many seasons of trying to live up to hype, you only become a shadow of your former self.
It almost seems like a cliche: The cool festival girl who has tousled hair and is able to pull off high-waisted jean shorts can take her pick out of the insane number of booty-bearing shorts left for display. And the model who dates a rocker (or a poser who tries) can throw on her faux-fur short coat over a sparkly party dress and look “so put-together without trying.”
The clothes are predictable and uninspiring. Not to mention the fact that the largest size is a size 12, a fact that limits its audience heavily. Don’t curvier girls get to play Kate Moss too?
Hopefully Topshop will return to the styles that made it so popular in the first place. By staying true to its so-hip-we-don’t-care roots, maybe more will become receptive to the new store. For now, however, it’s not worth it to jet on over to The Grove for a first-hand look — they have some work to do.

In regard to Pi Kappa Phi’s “Phi-esta”
Fellow Trojans,
On behalf of the brothers of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, I would like to apologize for the insensitive statements made on the Facebook event description for our “Phiesta.”
We recognize that these statements were offensive and we want to take full accountability for the insensitivity of our actions. The statements made were not only offensive to Latinos and Hispanics, but to everyone in the Trojan Family. The brothers of Pi Kappa Phi recognize that our actions are unbecoming of the values of the Trojan community, and that, furthermore, our actions represent this university, as well as our national fraternity and Greek Life as a whole. We deeply regret having misrepresented our national fraternity and USC in this manner. Additionally, I would like to mention and thank USC Junior Melissa Morales, who, in writing a thoughtful letter to the Daily Trojan that accurately criticized our insensitivity, embodied the Trojan values of sticking to one’s beliefs.
The statements made in the event description do not reflect the beliefs or values of the Delta Rho Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi. We are a brotherhood that deeply values our diversity and we will continue to be a brotherhood for men of all races and ethnicities. The individuals who were responsible for the Facebook event and the insensitive statements are being held responsible and will be facing expulsion from the fraternity. It is my hope that these individuals, and all of my brothers, will use this opportunity to grow as human beings.
Again, I would like to sincerely apologize on behalf of my brothers at Pi Kappa Phi. Thank you for taking the time to read this. If anyone wishes to contact us further, please do not hesitate.
Spencer Weissberg
President, Pi Kappa Phi
Pi Kappa Phi is one of the most reckless fraternities on the row.  They continuously push the boundaries and are bound for steep sanctions in the very near future.
In response to the comments above, they have are ranked 20th out of the 24 fraternities recognized by the USC IFC.  This shows a complete lack of organization by their executive board who is allowing such blatant lies about their academics and social standings.  They selflessly promote themselves as a “top house”, when they are nothing but a lower tier organization with absolutely no emphasis on academics. They truly are  “faking it ’til they make it”, which obviously is not working.
Theta is becoming the bottom of bottom houses.  Your PC sucked as bad as your security guard.
Trojans,
Faithful, Scholarly, Skilful, Courageous, Ambitious
Virtues ours.
If you doubt this, visit University Park.
Fight On!
Don’t forget the people that clean that fountain were made to look like fools by these frat boys!
I find it ironic that you blame the “frat boys” for their insensitivity when you yourself assume that only Latinos are fit to clean your fountain.
I am Latino and I have spoken with the grounds people in front of Doheny several times, in Spanish!  Are you suggesting they don’t clean the fountain?   Only Gringos clean the fountain?   Is that what you are saying?
Who’s the concerned bible thumping mom? I’m sure your son is not well respected because he sounds like a straight pussy. If by “top house” you mean the lamest house on the row with the highest gpa you might be right.
It is truly sad that you feel compelled to attack me and my son for our beliefs.   The fact that my son is in the top house, has a near perfect GPA and does not drink or do drugs obviously bothers you.  I can only assume your relationship with your parents is not as close as ours.  Maybe your grades are not so stellar and you can only find relationships after she has had enough liquor to tolerate your inadequacies.   I hope as you age, you grow as a man and find peace in the Lord.      
Despite your attack on our family, we will all pray for you. 
God Bless and yes, we forgive you!
USC Mom, you might want to stop being so self righteous.
First off, there is no such thing as “the top house”; there are a number of houses who perform better than others on a number of criteria, but because everyone is different, and diverse, and that there are different criteria to judge what is good, different houses can claim a top spot.  So please stop telling us about how much better than everyone else your son and his house are.  Oh, and if you mean AGO, then you’re just fully delusional.
Second, you might believe that the only way to be an upstanding citizen is to pray constantly, not drink, and refrain from hanging out with “licentious women” — well, that really is a minority opinion.  So please, again, enough with the self-righteousness.  Extremists and patronizing statements like yours are why no one will ever take you (or your perfect son) seriously.
Finally, since you brought up the fence put up by your suposedly-good-buddy Nikias, could it be that the administration is putting up that fence for the sole purpose of distracting attention from the fact that the shooting would never have occurred, had Michael Jackson not have expressly approved a party that had such obvious potential for degenerating?   USC invited outsiders to a halloween party, that is why there was a problem.  Perhaps Nikias and his administration should take some responsibility for their mistake rather than putting up a useless fence that will do nothing but further isolate USC from the community and strengthen the ‘spoiled children’ image of the school.
PS: nobody cares if you forgive us, especially when there is nothing to be forgiven to start with.  you troll on this board with extremist, patronizing statements, you should expect people to voice disagreement
Throw your stones but know we are protected by his shield and forgive you for your wickedness upon us
There is one “top house” and everyone knows who it is except apparently you.  It is not a religious fraternity but a true social fraternity with a long history at USC.  My son happens to be member of this fraternity while maintaining his christian ethics and morals.   I’ll agree that not all his fellow members are exceptional students nor do they live in a manner that he or I approve of.   He and others whom have seen the Light within the fraternity are working hard to change the membership in his fraternity for the better while maintaining its current top fraternity status.  This is one of the reasons he has taken upon himself to minster to the other fraternity members who’s hearts and minds are still open to the Truth.  
The row can be a place of great sin and temptation of the flesh.  I have heard many stories of sorority girls who given their bodies to strange boys to fill the void in their hearts.  It doesn’t have to be this way and you can recover your dignity through virtue and study of the Truth.   I hope these fallen girls correct their paths before damnation scorches their souls. 
Once again someone feels the need to attack Mr. Jackson when he has nothing to do with this discussion.   He is a man of honor and integrity of which you will likely never achieve nor understand.    
President Nikias is a brilliant and visionary leader of USC whom you should show more respect.  Fencing the campus was long overdue and thankfully he had the grit and determination to overcome the naysayers like yourself.  He does this despite your foolishness and wickedness.
We pray for all, including you!
We forgive all, including you!  
God Bless!
Things on the row definitely need to change.  I had to drop my frat as they were completely out of control.  It was the best thing for me as I needed to focus on my business.  Now as an alumni, my business is kicking hard.  From what I hear, the row is falling apart and hurting the reputation of USC.  This needs to change, now!  I hope SC steps in and closes the worst offenders down.
Trojan Family,
Puhleeze! As a third generation Trojan alumnus complete with Fighting Methodist forebears), I ask: Are you kidding? 28th Street, AKA “The Row” has been and remains notorious for everything from gang rape to felony assault and back again to this, their, racism. Now that a notorious enabler like “Dr.” Michael Jackson is retiring; would it not be a good time for a re-thinking (operative term: Think) the benefit of 28th St. to USC’s future? Today the “Row” represents less than 3% of the total undergraduate student body and less than 1% of the total student population of University Park. Add HSC and the numbers speak for themselves.
Heck! My mom and dad, during WWII, were the presidents of their respective houses: Theta and Delt respectively. Evolution, being what it is, we should all demand that this continued form of ignorance, cease. Else, we all become the laughing stock of our peers in this nation of great, public and private, university students and alumni.
Apologies, notwithstanding, the time for action is now. I leave it to you, my Trojan family to decide.
Fight On!
Yes, USC is a family, but for some time the Trojan family has been a dysfunctional family. The Trojan “parents” seem to be working hard to better their family and develop a first rate reputation, while seemingly oblivious to their kids behavior. A small, but vocal, core  seem to be playing “Lord of the Flies” far too seriously, and once again near and distant neighbors have taken note.
USC has deservedly made national news for an unsavory social atmosphere and Greek student behavior regarding the Phi-esta incident. At least the weekend is soon upon us and the campus c focus can shift away from Phi-esta, probably to the USC Hookup page. It will really be an interesting online read when our neighbors near and far come across that and comment on us!
Do you read the things you post? Jesus christ this whole thing is so blown out of proportion it’s ridiculous. You’re going to use this stupid letter that revolves around one Facebook post that offended someone to put the entire row into one group? If you want to talk about the benefit of 28th St to USC’s future, don’t base the whole discussion around a stupid Facebook post from an irrelevant house. I’ll be the first to acknowledge that the row has its issues, but, like most things, the vast majority of these problems arise from a small portion of the population. The problem with USC is not the row, it’s the few idiots who inexplicably get in here and give the rest of us a bad name, Greek or otherwise. What if this had been a house party completely unrelated to the row? Come to think of it, I bet there are offensive themes and happenings at all sorts of parties, not just Greek ones. 
Gang rape? Felony assault? Maybe from locals but have you been on 28th St lately? Keep things in perspective babe, someone had an idea for a party that was offensive, end of story. Also, less than 3% of the undergraduate population? USC’s own website says that over 3,500 students are greek, which puts that number right around 20%. It is unbelievably ignorant of you to judge such a large part of your own Trojan Family to be lazy, racist, walking PR problems for the school. Get your facts straight before you post such pretentious generalizations and insult a fifth of the undergraduate population.
You did get one thing right though Zooey. The continued ignorance must cease. The ignorance of people who are not involved with Greek life, have no idea what it’s actually about, and form opinions about it based solely off negative headlines they see. If that’s your opinion and you’re sticking to it, good for you, but next time keep your uninformed views to yourself.
I appreciate your outrage, but it is misdirected at me. Do a search of “USC racism” or “USC Betches” or USC Playboy party school or FB USC Hookups, just for example. The most troubling social behaviors are displayed by a minority to be sure, but they keep happening. Why do so few other top 25 schools have such negative headlines regarding their social climate?  
If headlines are made solely by the minority as you say, where is the pushback by the majority? Where is the wellspring of the many over the years establishing a more laudable social norm such as you might find at Yale or Stanford? You can substitute the Phi-esta headline for some from 5 years ago. Not much has changed. 
Did you read the comments based on one Trojan’s attempt to comment in the DT on the inappropriateness of Phi-esta? She was skewered by many and others recounted equally troubling experiences. There were far fewer, very few, student voices of agreement and support. 
Students have tremendous power to set limits for social behavior. USC students have. You seem to be saying they need to be raised.  Do it!
I hope no one believes Zooey or this self-proclaimed parent represents most parents.    Most “real” parents see the row in a different light and don’t assume gang rape is a common occurrence.  The Greek system at USC is as strong as ever and many former members have achieved great success in life.  Yes, bad things happen but not always on the row!  Bad things happen all around SC and that is why President Nikias rightfully closed the campus at night.    You notice the row is not fenced off, just the campus.
Of all the things a frat brother could do to be kicked out of a fraternity, don’t let it be this. Regardless of how someone feels about their actions, it doesn’t make sense to kick them out completely for their “mistake” if they apologize or comply with whatever the “proper” actions are
Yeah, come on guys, it was just a harmless mistake. They all slipped, fell, and accidentally landed in a pile of caricatured Mexican “costumes” and rolled on top of keyboards that were programmed to type only words that reduce a people and their culture to nothing but negative stereotypes. Let us all give them a break and have as much empathy for them as they have for the people they mock and promote racism towards.
Blah blah blah blah. Learn to have a good time bro. Keep fratting.
Pi kapp? Fratty? I think not. Go away losers. Stop self promoting.
Ok while you guys argue over whether or not its ok to dress up as mexicans at a party and whether or not thats offensive, Ill bring up a new issue by addressing the bigger picture here. (Keep in mind that, at its core, what you guys are arguing is merely an ethical debate: a question of whats ethical with no right or wrong answer. Is the ability to have this party a human freedom of expression? who knows? Do we as humans have the right to end lives via death penalty? Who knows?)
Anyway, the problem here is actually not whats going on in a frat house.  Every human’s goal is to be happy, and the pi kapp party attenders had fun.  The problem is that Melissa thought they had fun AT HER EXPENSE.  Which is a hard argument to make considering that she did not have to go.  Melissa intends to convince me, a reader, that, while she was in her appt this night watching TV or w/e, her psychological state was actively being decreased by people raging in sombreros a few blocks away.  Everyone does everything they do for happiness, and Melissa’s choice to write out against people that were making her unhappy is no exception.  
As the south park skier meme dude always says, “if you base your happiness on externalities and the actions of others, youre gunna have a bad time.” Despite being comfortable on your appt couch, you let the actions of people in a frat house make you unhappy.  Everyone can be defined by many things.  Race, religion, looks, skater, guys with pierced ears, skinny jeans, music choice, west coast, east coast, south, midwest, sexual attractions, the list is infinite.  Everyone is subject to stereotype humor, but its not harmful unless its actually harmful. Think about it, we have families who are separated and/or killed on behalf of race religion etc.  Then, on a MUCH less severe scale we have lebron james, who, because he decided it was a good move for him to change his identity from a Cleveland to a Miami basketball player, was LABELED as a sell-out.  He became subject to tons of criticism pointed directly at him, people from akron and cleveland saying they hate him and burning his cavs jerseys, and getting people calling him a sellout all over the media all the time.  Just for making a choice he felt was right for his life.  
But he is proud of his identity as a Heat player.  I disagree, Melissa, that you are a proud Mexican.  By indirectly being affected by something that is a fun event (not intended to hurt feelings) that you can easily escape from by just staying home, you are effected by this criticism towards a facet of your identity MUCH less than lebron’s case, yet it makes you unhappy? Doesnt pride come from within? I dont see how the experience of you and your family doing Mexican heritage culture stuff will be any less significant because of this.
This is in good fun, and should be laughed at. You will be happier this way. I am 2nd generation Greek American.  My mom’s dad was an illegal immigrant that still does not speak english well.  Greece is arguably ruining Europe’s economy.  Why is it that there is not a single Greek stereotype joke you can make that can offend me at all?  The movie, my big fat greek wedding, which is a comedy based entirely of making fun of greek stereotypes, is a shockingly accurate story of my mom’s life, and has been watched and laughed at multiple times by my family.  
If as a Mexican American, a frat party is how racism effects you negitively, it sounds like overall the perks of racism (artificially giving opportunities to people based race alone aka affirmative action) it sounds like overall racism evens out to at least a neutral effect in your life.
Obviously with a less controversial theme, right?   
Not really fair to kick anybody out over this so I suggest you rethink.   You could have done far worse and been celebrated if you guys were top tier.
It looks like this fraternity has already been suspended.  I googled them and here is their web site: http://www.uscpikapp.com   So maybe all of you can calm down.  They are gone.
I understand the LA Times is writing an article about this right now.   Thanks to Melissa, the whole World will soon know about this story.
Jerry, where did you hear that the LA Times is writing an article about this? I’m confused because they never even had the party
A lady who said she was a Times reporter was interviewing people on the row for comments.   She asked people if they were planning on attending the “Racist Row Party”.  Then she showed people print-outs from a FB page.   This was the first time I had heard anything about this story then checked the DT and found this.  I also saw Channel 2 and 5 news trucks were parked in the Del Taco parking lot as well.  It looks like this is going to get major coverage. 
So you know, I did not offer any comments as I knew nothing about this story at the time.  Regardless, I would not attend a racist party anyway!
I appreciate the apology being offered by Spencer, the Phi Kappa Phi president.   It sounds sincere and I believe those like Melissa and others truly offended should turn the other cheek and move on.   I’m afraid this situation and other similar bad behavior has brought considerable shame to USC and the Greek system.    I want to point out that not all men in the Greek system share in the blame for this and other unfortunate stories.   Young men like my son who has been a member of the top fraternity at USC for 3 years.   Along with maintaining a stellar GPA for all three years, he does not participate in any alcohol or drug use.   Further, he abstains from the many licentious women that frequent the row.   He ministers weekly to his fraternity brothers and has brought many of them back into the Light of the Lord.    I hope that situations like this one do not tarnish the reputation of the many other young men like my son that honor still exists in the Greek system.  I ask that everyone look past this particular fraternities failings and see the many qualities that do continue to exist on the row among quality young men in better fraternities.
God Bless Spencer!
What is this singular top fraternity you speak of? One of the blonde hair, blue eye’d orange county bro frats? That must be what you speak one…
It is not important that I identify what everyone apparently already knows about my son’s fraternity.   Likely just by my description many in the better fraternities and sororities already know my son.   He is apparent well liked and respected among his peers.
I want to correct something about what I wrote before.   I need to apologize to the Phi Kappa fraternity (if there is one).  I meant to say the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity which is the actual fraternity that is apologizing for something or other.   It was not until I saw a news report on the channel 5 newscast earlier today that I realized my error.   Pi Kappa Phi is the old sorority house on the corner of 28th and University.   Does anyone find it odd that a fraternity occupies a sorority house?  Other than the landscaping being in disrepair, i still expect to see girls in long dresses singing songs to potential pledges during rush.   I would think the boys would make their house look more masculine.   
I am sorry to hear their national fraternity or the university has apparently stepped in to manage them after this.
God Bless!
Boy, everything you write is misinformed. Literally everything you have written is wrong. I don’t know what to say. I’m sorry.
Mr. or Mrs LOL,
I love how you give no details about what I have apparently written being wrong.   I have you know I have had several calls with Greek Life and President Nikias staff since this story occurred a few days ago.   These calls where not specifically about this situation but I am deeply involved in the University, fundraising and generally and what goes on around campus.   This story was discussed and I was given specific information by staff.   Please tell me how I have been misinformed by University staff so I might correct them, if necessary.  
And for that person above that apparently felt necessary to bad-mouth one of the most kind and generous African American gentlemen working at SC, you should be
 ashamed.   Mr. Jackson is not retiring but taking on new and more important role that includes many new challenges to make SC even better.  If his “enabling” is problem for you, then you have no idea what he accomplished in his role and you have no business enjoying the fruits of his success (USC now being a top Academic Institution)!
Regardless, God Bless all!
Time to stop the shameless self-promotion Phi Kap.   It has obviously completely backfired.
Your name would be generic as fuuh.. Go start a conspiracy theory somewhere else
Not good enough!   This frat needs to be shut down for good!   You can’t apologize away the inherit racism that persists in frats like this one.   Expel them all and raze the building so that a park can be created for the benefit of all!
1. This event was promptly removed from Facebook
2. It was the work of 2 people (they are personally being held responsible)
3. The brothers facing expulsion was a decision made within the fraternity
4. Pi Kapp is a very diverse fraternity.
5. To assume all negative comments made on Melissa Morales article came from a brother of Pi Kappa Phi is ridiculous.
You guys are ridiculous for caving into pressure.  Such a Total Lower Tier Move  #TLTM.
Sorry you decided to give into the pressure of one rather stupid gamma phi
Hey Spencer,
How many members will be expelled? Did Pi Kappa Phi arrive at the decision to expel members and write this letter completely independently or with input from the administration? There were many comments directed to Ms. Morales from quite a number of individuals which I presume were authored by members of other houses. This incident, along with the USC FB Hookup page, expose significant attitudes, beliefs and behaviors that damage both personal and the  university’s reputation. 
It seems time for careful reflection about what the majority want the character and identity of USC
to be–(1) rising elite university or (2) University of Spoiled Children and 2013 Playboy #1 Party School having been #2 in 2012.  It is doubtful USC can be both. This may be a great time for all–Greeks, GDI’s, faculty, staff and admins to begin a dialogue, reach a consensus and actively work together to support one direction or the other.
Thank you so much for posting this letter’; it’s definitely a step in the right direction. I’m still a bit confused though, does this mean the party is cancelled? The description is changed? The theme is changed? Or was this just an apology letter at face value?
Dear Spencer, 
Thank you so much for your thoughtful and eloquent letter. I know the recent events ware probably not easy to deal with, but you have done a great job in handling the matter. Kudos to you and your brothers. 
See you on the Row.
As a Latino, I can’t say I can speak for all Latinos and Hispanics, but the event was aimed at Mexican Culture, yet in this apology, you’ve stretched that culture to encompass ALL types of Latinos and Hispanics.
I’m not being THAT guy that says it’s not good enough and is being nitpicky, because I commend this letter. It’s just something I felt I should point out.
In the end though, this is a very mature and responsible way to handle the situation that was risen.
Your comment was so useless, someone couldve written nothing and it wouldve done the same damage
You sound like a bigot

Those considered mentally disabled deserve to be safe from executions that they cannot comprehend. 
With less than an hour until his scheduled execution, convicted killer Warren Lee Hill was granted a stay on Tuesday by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Ga. In its statement, the court said the stay was necessary to review the newly submitted affidavits testifying to the mental capacity of Hill, who allegedly holds an IQ of 70, according to The Guardian.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
An IQ of 70 is considered the base for mental disability, and it’s clear the government was correct in staying the execution.
There are few less deserving of execution than the mentally disabled. In 2002’s landmark case Atkins v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that executing the mentally disabled was a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. But under the law in Georgia, the state in which Hill is incarcerated, the state could execute anyone unless they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt to be mentally disabled; Hill had not been able to do so.
But Hill, with an IQ of 70 and affidavits from three doctors testifying to his lack of mental capacity, certainly seems to meet the standards for mentally disabled under both Georgia and federal law. It’s also important to mention that Georgia is the only state with such a strict policy: Other states, for example, require only a “preponderance of the evidence,” making it more difficult to execute a mentally disabled criminal. By saying that one’s mental disability must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, it only makes it more difficult for those who need help to receive it.
And though some might see a criminal as simply a criminal, it’s important to dive deeper into the situation. The mentally disabled are citizens who need help, and prisoners with mental disabilities particularly need reform, not punishment; the goal of the Department of Corrections, after all, is to provide corrections and reduce recidivism rates in America. The context of Hill’s case is particularly important: His mother and grandfather allegedly beat a young Hill in the head, often with a cast-iron lamp. Having never received proper assistance for his mental disability, Hill should now be given special consideration in his incarceration and should not be executed.
This case also provides interesting fuel for the argument that the death penalty should be reformed or abolished. Though the idea behind capital punishment is that some criminals are just too vile to be reformed, the same result could be  — and currently is — reached with life imprisonment. If prisoners are truly beyond reform, then locking them away in maximum-security facilities with no chance of release is as protective to the American public as execution.
Furthermore, a death sentence costs significantly less than life imprisonment. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, death penalties — from trial to incarceration to appeals — routinely cost millions of dollars. The cost of imprisoning a death row inmate alone costs $90,000 more than a non-capital inmate. According to Amnesty International, if California stopped executing prisoners, the costs of the California justice system would drop from $137 million per year to just $11.5 million.
The money saved every year from life imprisonment could be put to good use reforming the corrections system in the United States. A better corrections system means fewer recidivists, fewer crimes and safer streets. The money could also be put to good use increasing the level of care available for people with mental disabilities. Hopefully it is not too late for Hill or for millions of Americans in the years to come.

Giving special preference to certain inmates will only encourage others to manipulate the system unfairly. 
Warren Lee Hill, a twice-convicted killer who has been on death row since 1991 for his crimes, was granted a stay of his execution scheduled for this past Tuesday. Hill, 52, was deemed mentally disabled and, thus, unaccountable for his crimes after a panel of experts convened and agreed that the criminal’s IQ test result qualified as mentally retarded in terms of legal declaration. Thus, he has been given an indefinite stay of execution and a promise of further review for his case.
Even though his IQ has been found lacking, Hill has proven himself able to conform to the daily rigors of both free society and prison. His death sentence, after all, was given only after he had beaten his cellmate Joseph Handspike to death in his sleep with a board full of nails in 1990. He had landed himself a life sentence prior to this incident by shooting his girlfriend Myra Wright 11 times in 1985.
Even if Hill is legitimately mentally disabled, he has shown that he is capable of premeditated murder and is much too dangerous to be a part of any society. Execution is the only recourse that is logical, as his stay of execution does nothing more than provide him more possible opportunities to repeat his crimes and waste the state’s time and funds to keep the public safe from him.
Some might argue that the stay is justifiable if he is, indeed, mentally handicapped and that he ought to be put into a program intended to promote reformation in felons. However, Hill has murdered not once, but twice, and is statistically very likely to do so again if given the opportunity. His past crimes are merit enough to keep him from ever rejoining the public, unstable as he is.
Though the State of Georgia is firmly against the idea of executing those whose mentally faculties are either underdeveloped or damaged, they need to make allowances for cases in which the one who is being tried is a legitimate menace to society. As it is, he is draining public resources and living comfortably under the guise of a simpleton in a malleable justice system.
The last-ditch effort to preserve the life of this murderer was to assert that he is not in full control of his mental faculties. It is incredibly suspicious that after two full trials for murder, the defense that he is mentally disabled is only barely coming out. This defense is obviously a cunning manipulation of the public forum as, again, Georgia is firmly prohibitive against the execution of those who are mentally incapable, and the maneuver is quickly garnering support from people who are unwilling to let a man with a lower IQ take responsibility for his actions.
Hill and his attorney are playing the system to their own tune, and the system proving itself to be unbelievably willing to dance. This not only reflects negatively on mentally disabled people — stories with much media coverage like this can cause people not familiar with the challenges of mental disability to falsely assume that mentally disabled Americans are violent. This also trivializes the very real struggles of disabled people because the defense of mental disability, a legitimate one, was offered so late in the trial process.
The evidence itself is suspect. The testimony of his sister, Peggy Hill, implying that their upbringing caused Hill brain damage, is also certainly not unbiased, and therefore unreliable as well. There is no other evidence beside word-of-mouth to confirm her story that physical abuse caused him health problems and could easily be fabricating the truth to aid her brother’s case. It would certainly not be the first time that a family member gave false testimony in order to give their loved one a chance to be free of the system, and it certainly won’t be the last.
If every felon can simply fool the justice system with a last-minute application to bomb an IQ test and pretend to be mentally disabled for a panel of specialists, it looks like we’ll be having a lot more stays of execution in the future. Hopefully, mental disability does not take the place of the place of insanity pleas for criminals looking to get easier sentencing when they’re brought to trial for their misdeeds.

I am sorry, Melissa Mendes, but your argumentation is seriously flawed. You claim that the attempt to prove that the inmate is mentally disabled is a last-ditch effort; if that  were the case, it would indeed be a suspicious move to gain time. But get your facts straight.  “Hill’s lawyers have long claimed he’s mentally disabled and therefore shouldn’t be executed. Last week they released new sworn statements from the three doctors who examined Hill in 2000 and previously testified he was not mentally disabled.” (Huffington Post) In case you don’t trust the HuffPost, here is what the Court of Appeal says:
“In the state court proceedings in 2000, Hill presented four experts who testified that Hill was mentally retarded, and the State presented three experts … who testified that Hill was not. In the face of the whole record, the state courts concluded at the time that Hill was mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence, but that Hill had failed to demonstrate that he was mentally retarded beyond a reasonable doubt as required by [state law]. In his current application, however, Hill has filed affidavits from all three of the State’s experts … each of whom has revised his opinion and now testifies that Hill meets the criteria for mental retardation.”
Interesting, isn’t it, that the state of Georgia was so keen on getting Hill executed/murdered that they presented three “experts” that defended Georgia’s viewpoint. None of them was obviously independent or unbiased at that point in time (by now, they have all changed their opinion on Hill’s mental abilities).
Also, dear Melissa, but is execution the only way to keep someone away from the public because he/she is considered a danger? Seriously, that is the point of therapy and medication and secure, solitary confinement.

Asian American producer, actor and civil servant Kal Penn spoke about the empowerment of all students to openly connect and discuss their own ethnic and cultural identity in Bovard Auditorium Monday.
Penn was the keynote speaker at the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival. Each year, APASA and its member organizations celebrate their culture with other students and to promote Asian Pacific American awareness as a whole on campus.
Penn, known for starring as Kumar Patel in the Harold & Kumar movies and as Dr. Lawrence Kutner on the TV show House, served as an associate director and liaison for Asian American and Pacific Islander policy in the White House Office of Public Engagement between 2009 and 2011, with a break in 2010 to film A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas. He also served as a co-chair for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign.
Penn said while media is beginning to incorporate a more diversified outlook, the stereotypical cultures shown on everyday television shows still contrast what people see, observe and experience in their daily lives.
“There are still some pretty big sociological differences between what we see in the media and what we see in real life,” Penn said. “The rest of America doesn’t look like what happens when you turn on the TV.”
Though critical of it, Penn acknowledged that the media is slowly evolving to portray diversity in its true forms and dimensions.
“If you look at representation and diversity in the media, you’ll notice that, generally speaking, there aren’t a whole lot of characters who look like me,” Penn said. “Historically speaking, it’s been a lack of willingness by big media companies to produce and cast things in a color-blind manner but, recently, the trend has been rapidly changing in the last five to ten years.”
As an Asian American and Pacific Islander liaison for the White House, Penn said his job was no different than what million of people do everyday.
“It’s not that much different than what a lot of you guys are doing,” Penn said. “Your fraternities and sororities that tutor once a week, or ethnic organizations that organize food drives — all of that was no different than my job of getting every federal agency that had had a program related to the Asian American or Pacific Islander community to regularly meet with a commission from the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.”
Andrew Dippel, a senior majoring in business administration, said he enjoyed hearing Penn speak because of Penn’s experience as a public servant.
“You hear a lot about the Asian Pacific community, but you don’t really hear too many people that have direct experience working to benefit the community.” Dippel said. “It was refreshing to hear someone who has dealt with the issue personally.”
Ke-Lwun Yee, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, said Penn’s story was inspiring and that, though progress needed to be made, it was refreshing to hear Penn deliver the message.
“[Asian Americans] aren’t really portrayed in the media that often,” Yee said. “So it’s nice to know that there’s someone on the other side that’s willing to come talk to students about his successful journey as an Asian-American figure in the entertainment industry.”
