Despite the usual summer cutbacks in hours, many of USC’s hospitality locations will remain open during summer vacation.
Though residential dining hotspots like Everybody’s Kitchen and Parkside cafeterias are closed until fall, a number of restaurants within the Campus Center will remain open, including Carl’s Jr. and Panda Express, among others.

“We now have LiteraTea open every day for breakfast and lunch, which is something we didn’t do last year,” said Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality. “We worked with the libraries … which asked us to keep Popovich Café open so we’ve extended their hours. We’ve extended things quite a bit.”
With a lower number of students on campus, keeping all the university’s eateries open isn’t practical, Klinger said, but USC Hospitality is open to any suggestion.
“We’ll expand things in July when there are more people on campus, including opening Moreton Fig for lunch,” Klinger said. “We’re open to any feedback. We worked with Popovich and then with the library with LiteraTea. … Anyone else, we’re very open.”
Even so, some hospitality workers feel the sting of the cutbacks they’re now facing.
“It’s too short,” said Yolanda Segura, who works at Panda Express in the campus center. “We’re only scheduled five hours [per day during summer] when we’re normally scheduled seven and a half. I don’t have another job and it means less money.”
Segura added the university provides her with insurance, so she doesn’t feel neglected.
“I used to take the summers off, but I can’t afford it anymore,” Segura said. “Since last year, I have to work. Every summer is about the same, though. It has to be less [hours] because there are less [people].”
Klinger assured, however, that any person working with USC Hospitality would be guaranteed a job at the start of next year.
“Anyone that has a job with us, that was employed with us and had hours with us during the year,” Klinger said, “is still employed with us and will be employed with us during the school year at the start of the fall.”
For now, some workers have moved to other USC departments, such as Housing, other companies, like Universal Studios, or are simply taking the summer off, according to Klinger.
Students on campus during the summer think the Hospitality venues that are open now are good enough.
“It’s enough for me, I mostly go to [California Pizza Kitchen] and Carl’s Jr.,” said Tzu-Hsiang Chang, a graduate student studying material science. “I’ve spent other summers here and this is a welcome change.”
Vera Raina, a junior majoring in screenwriting, thinks the opening of the campus center has been relatively convenient.
“As an upperclassman, I don’t really go to the [cafeterias] anymore, so it’s good that there’s an on-campus place I can go to when I want to eat.”
Café 84 is closed during the summer, but all of the restaurants within the campus center will remain open except for Lemonade and Wahoo’s Fish Tacos.

The university honored more than 12,000 graduates Friday, as USC celebrated its 128th commencement, keying the ceremony with an address from Microsoft Corporation CEO Steve Ballmer, who stressed the importance of “great ideas” and passion.
Applause · Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stressed the importance of great ideas to the thousands gathered on USC campus on Friday for the university’s 128th commencement. - Kelvin Kuo | Summer Trojan 
“I think you start learning about passion and tenacity at USC before you even came here,” Ballmer said. “I think you knew it before you every finished your first tour of the USC campus. The motto of this place symbolizes passion and tenacity: ‘Fight on!’”
He also told graduates he was very optimistic about their future and the impact they can make.
“The opportunities that we’re seeing are really quite amazing,” Ballmer said. “I don’t think there’s any better time to come out of school and have a chance to make a difference across a broad variety of fields.”
Students said they enjoyed Ballmer’s animated speaking style, which elicited loud cheers from the audience several times.
“When a speaker says ‘Fight on,’ people will just say it back,” said Daniel Wiechert, who majored in psychology. “But with his energy, people got really pumped up and meant it.”
Ballmer, whose son attends USC, said the atmosphere of the university was “infectious” and that he “drank the USC ‘Kool-Aid.’”
“He was very funny and represented the school well,” said Nadine Ozedmir, who received a doctorate in pharmacology.
President C. L. Max Nikias had a slightly different message in his remarks, saying 2011 is a time of global change and uncertainty. He said graduates should embrace uncertainty as it is “the beginning of adventure,” and that they would always have the support of the Trojan Family.
“Always remember you do not go forward alone — you go forward as a lifetime member of the Trojan Family,” Nikias said. “This is the greatest and most dedicated community of its kind — to be a Trojan is to be a Trojan for life.”
During the ceremony, Nikias recognized valedictorian Sarrah Shahawy, who majored in biological sciences and French, and salutatorians Samantha Anacona, who majored in biological sciences and oboe performance, and Grant Western, who majored in mechanical engineering.
USC awarded honorary degrees to Ballmer; U.S. Army Materiel Command Commanding General Ann E. Dunwoody; USC Trustee and alumnus Ming Hsieh; Indian writer, actor and director Girish Karnad; former justice of the South African Constitutional Court Albie Sachs; and Noble Prize-winning virologist Harald zur Hausen.
Students said they enjoyed the commencement ceremony and Ballmer’s speech.
“He was really energetic,” said Mason Amato, who majored in economics. “It was a great
ceremony.”
@MMA: posibly, but – judging by your comment – they’re both brighter than you.
Yeah, so I guess Steve Ballmer’s son is not that bright either

It’s been called “The Hangover for girls,” but that falsely supposes two things.
Primarily, it insinuates that female audiences are somehow incapable of fully enjoying or appreciating Todd Phillips’ 2009 morning-after comedy about a trio of friends trying to piece together the events of the previous night’s drunken bender of a bachelor party. But secondly, and perhaps even more unfair still, by defining Bridesmaids in terms of the movie that’s apparently its male equivalent positions Bridesmaids as a poor (wo)man’s version of another film from the get-go and does a fine job of setting it up for inferiority.
Bridesmaids should be treated as a comedy in its own right, because despite whatever similarities it may have with The Hangover — which, surprisingly enough, did not invent gleeful crudity or marital themes — it really is a standalone film.
Bride wars · Lillian (Maya Rudolph, second from right), her maid of honor Annie (Kristen Wiig, far right) and her bridesmaids survey the wares in a posh bridal shop before wreaking utter gastrointestinal havoc. - Photo courtesy of Universal Studios 
Co-written by Annie Mumolo and Saturday Night Live’s current greatest hope, Kristen Wiig,  Bridesmaids follows childhood best friends Annie (Wiig) and Lillian (fellow SNL veteran Maya Rudolph) as they muck through meaningless dead-end encounters and worryingly stagnant relationships, respectively, in a recession-throttled Milwaukee.
But when Lillian receives a proposal from her longtime boyfriend Dougie in nearby Chicago, Annie loses her partner in commiseration and her failures in love and business — the would-be entrepreneur’s upstart bakery went out of business not too long after opening — are thrown into even starker contrast. As Lillian’s maid of honor appointee, responsibility falls to Annie to plan the events leading up to the wedding, but everything from the bridesmaids’ dresses to the Las Vegas bachelorette party getaway has a price tag, and that’s the first thing cash-strapped Annie makes note of.
Competition enters the equation when Lillian’s new friend Helen (Rose Byrnes) makes it clear that the only thing she’s better at than planning parties and making arrangements is inducing inferiority complexes. Gorgeous, graceful, well connected and dizzyingly rich, Helen is always waiting in the wings to swoop in and don the mantle of maid of honor at a moment’s notice. The latent animosity and outright competitiveness between Annie and Helen is instantaneous, but it slowly comes to a head over the course of Bridesmaids’ 125-minute runtime.
Having to give top-billing to a pair of SNL comics whose stints on the variety show occurred well after its widely acknowledged heyday might seem to be a kiss of death, but the noticeable lack of high-profile star-power doesn’t appear to have held the movie back: The film pulled in $26.2 million in its debut weekend, opening second only to Thor.
Lesser-known television actresses Wendy McLendon-Covey (Reno 911!), Ellie Kemper (The Office) and Melissa McCarthy (most recently seen on CBS’ Mike & Molly, but perhaps best remembered as Sookie on Gilmore Girls) delivered consistently scene-stealing performances and gave testament to the fact that the Will Ferrells and Zach Galifianakises of the world don’t have a monopoly on brash, crude and booze-fueled humor in Hollywood. A scene portraying the girlfriends’ gastrointestinal duress in a tony downtown bridal shop — in the wake of a lunch visit to a hole-in-the-wall Brazilian restaurant, of course — was both the most memorable part of the movie and a way to showcase the supporting actresses’ comedic chops.
Wiig’s Annie would press the limits of audiences’ sympathies if it weren’t for the unmistakable charm she brings to every role. Her character time and again returns to Jon Hamm’s Ted, an unrepentant womanizer and general slimeball who at one point dumps Annie by saying “You’re not my No. 3 anymore!” as he speeds off. But Annie’s stock eventually rises in the audience’s estimation when she begins to take note of Rhodes, a tail light-obsessed cop with an Irish accent.
Whether intentionally or not, a number of Wiig’s SNL creations creep into her portrayal of Annie. The brief lapses — the moment when Annie sees Lillian’s engagement ring for the first time, she has a mild freak-out not unlike her character Sue in the now-infamous “Surprise Party” sketch — function like Easter eggs for attentive Saturday Night Live fans who are paying close attention.
Director Paul Feig has directorial credits for episodes of Arrested Development, The Office, 30 Rock and Freaks and Geeks, producer Judd Apatow has had a hand in nearly every one of the decade’s most successful comedies (Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express) and the Saturday Night Live presence has already been established, so it’s clear that the comedy credentials were in place for Bridesmaids to become the success it is.
The most important voices in the filmmaking process, however, are, of course, writers Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo. Their strong and unique voices might not represent the expectation of women writers, but the pair pull off a raucously raunchy good time with Bridesmaids.

What would have happened if Abel had survived Cain’s blow? Where would the brothers from the Old Testament story have gone from there?
Burnin’ up · A loyal Roseboro fan, the young Roger Guenveur Smith was so incensed by the brutality displayed by Juan Marichal that he burned Marichal’s baseball card while chanting ‘Burn, baby, burn.’ - Photo courtesy of Joan Marcus 
Along with a real-life incident that played itself out at the San Francisco Giants’ historic Candlestick Park in late August 1965, that provocative hypothetical informs Obie Award-winner Roger Guenveur Smith’s one-man show Juan and John. The play will have its premiere West Coast staging at the Kirk Douglas Theatre on Thursday.
The Berkeley, Calif.-born and Crenshaw District-bred writer and actor is a self-admitted history buff — Smith grew up reading Encyclopedia Britannica for fun and had a poster of the U.S. presidents on the wall in his childhood bedroom. Before auditioning for and being accepted to Yale’s prestigious drama program, he arrived at the university with every intention of pursuing a Ph.D. in history.
His fondness for combining his loves of history and acting notwithstanding, Smith’s particular interest in Juan and John’s infamous source material — the most notorious brawl in Major League Baseball history — stems from a much more private place for Smith than run-of-the-mill historical
curiosity.
“I have a very personal stake in this story, because when I was a kid, I was watching the game on TV,” Smith said. “I witnessed this brutal act of violence live.”
The “brutal act of violence” Smith describes that occurred on August 22, 1965, mere feet from home plate in the Giants’ home field of Candlestick Park, so affected him at six years of age that it eventually inspired an entire solo performance. In the bottom of the third inning of a high-stakes game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants — longtime adversaries whose rivalry had been stoked by a particularly tight pennant race in an especially close season — Dodgers catcher Johnny Roseboro returned the ball to pitcher Sandy Koufax with a throw that was too close to at-bat Giants pitcher Juan Marichal’s ear for the batter’s liking.
Tensions were already running high in the fiercely contested matchup, so the Dominican Marichal’s comment to Ohio-native Roseboro — which Marichal later alleged to Giants manager Herman Franks was nothing more than a harmless “Why did you do that?” — was enough to spur Roseboro to take a step toward Marichal. Interpreting Roseboro’s advance as aggression, Marichal repeatedly clubbed the Dodgers catcher on the head with his bat, opening up a two-inch gash that, while not proving fatal, would later necessitate more than a dozen stitches.
Both the home and away teams’ dugouts quickly emptied as players joined the fray; the ensuing brawl delayed the game for 14 minutes. Marichal’s attack garnered the pitcher an eight-game suspension, earned him a $1,750 fine and was thought to have kept him out of the Baseball Hall of Fame, in spite of the respectable 243 wins on his record.
Watching the awful drama unfold in a live broadcast, the young Roger Guenveur Smith was especially upset because of a strong fondness for the bludgeoned Dodgers catcher Roseboro.
“I was a passionate Dodgers fan, and I was a passionate John Roseboro fan — he was a hero of mine,” Smith said in a phone interview. (Smith’s entirely acceptable excuse for being unable to meet for our scheduled face-to-face sit-down? The birth of his son, one day before previews began for Juan and John.)
By the time of the attack, Smith had already met Roseboro at a community event and had been given an autographed photo of the player. His loyalties were cemented from there on out.
“When [Roseboro] was bleeding there on my television screen, I became so upset with what Juan Marichal had done that I took Juan Marichal’s baseball card out of my collection and I burned it,” Smith said. “I chanted ‘Burn, baby, burn,’ because that’s what I had heard on the streets of L.A. just a week before that during the Watts riots.”
Photo courtesy of Joan Marcus
Smith’s timeline is accurate. The spate of violent unrest that swept through South L.A. had its generally acknowledged inciting incident — the arrest of an apparently intoxicated black motorist named Marquette Frye by California Highway Patrol officer Lee Minikus — only eleven days before the Marichal-Roseboro incident took place.
“I was upset because it was my hero, John Roseboro, who was bleeding,” Smith said. “But of course, it was 1965, and Watts was exploding, Vietnam was exploding, the Dominican Republic, in fact, was occupied by 23,000 U.S. troops.”
Growing up, Smith’s nickname “Hollywatts” — an amalgam of ‘Hollywood’ and ‘Watts’ — acknowledged the peculiar geographic position occupied by Smith’s neighborhood, the Crenshaw District. According to Smith, the dichotomy of his nickname accurately captures his experiences growing up in L.A., and the feeling of sometimes belonging to two worlds.
If his 2006 solo performance The Watts Tower Project, a celebration of Italian construction worker Simon Rodia’s iconic architectural assemblage, is any indication, Smith is fully appreciative of what a significant and formative impact his Los Angeles upbringing had on him.
In spite of the highly public nature of the Marichal-Roseboro news story when it first broke, Smith harbors no delusions that the incident will be immediately familiar to anyone.
“I don’t expect a general theatergoing audience to know anything about Juan Marichal and John Roseboro,” Smith said. “It was a long time ago. But it’s an extraordinary story. It continues to resonate, and I’d like to think that the play resonates for people who don’t know anything or even care anything about baseball because, bottom line, it’s the story of Cain and Abel.”
Though the chief source of material for Smith’s one-man show is technically an isolated moment in history, and the story is told through his experience of it, the creator-performer sees the show as being much more universal in scope.
“It’s much more than that. It’s about politics, it’s about family and forgiveness and redemption, all of those things.”

The players on the USC baseball team are just like your average student. And like any student, they seem to enjoy not having school.
Over spring break, the Trojans (20-27, 10-11) snapped an eight-game losing streak and went 5-2. Last
weekend, after not having played for 10 days because of finals, the squad took two of three from No. 6 Arizona State to break out of a six-game slide.
Leading the way · Junior pitcher Andrew Triggs looks to get USC off on the right foot in the first game of a three-game set against the Beavers. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
USC gets another top-10 team on their slate this weekend with No. 2 Oregon State. It’s the Trojans third series of the season against a top-10 team, but the Beavers (37-12, 16-5) are different than the Sun Devils and USC’s other top-10 opponent, No. 7 Cal State Fullerton. The Titans started the season at No. 8 and Arizona State started at No. 11. The Beavers were expected to finish seventh in the Pac-10 and were under the radar.
But the results don’t lie. The Beavers haven’t lost a series all season, haven’t lost three consecutive games and have run off a pair of double-digit win streaks (11 and 12 games).
“They’ve got some older guys; some good experience,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “They’ve gelled together real well. And they can flat out pitch.”
The Beavers are second in the conference with a 2.90 ERA and a .238 opponents’ batting average. Left-handed pitcher Josh Osich tossed a no-hitter against No. 24 UCLA on April 30, but he’s not even the ace of the staff. That title goes to right-handed pitcher Sam Gaviglio. The junior is a top-100 prospect with a 10-1 record and a 1.74 ERA. His WHIP is 1.03, and he has fanned 90 hitters while issuing just 21 walks. Perhaps most impressive is that he averages more than seven innings pitched per start.
But the Trojans are no slouch on the hill either. Junior right-hander Andrew Triggs and senior Logan Odom are each coming off complete game performances against the Sun Devils. Triggs will take the mound on Friday, presumably against Gaviglio, while Odom will round out the rotation on Sunday in the series finale.
Sandwiched in the middle on Saturday is junior Austin Wood. The former fourth-round draft pick hasn’t had the season he or the Trojans has hoped for, with a 4-6 record and 5.48 ERA. But the righty went seven strong innings against Arizona State last Saturday, and looks to build on that in Corvallis this weekend.
Indeed, the team as a whole is looking to build on their performance last weekend and carry the momentum to the road. The Trojans are an abysmal 5-13 away from Dedeaux Field this season, including 3-6 on the road in conference play.
“Going on the road is a chore [for us],” Cruz said. “Add in the No. 2 team in the country; we’re gonna have to be just about perfect.”
Although the Trojans will face tough pitching this weekend, the coaching staff believes they are more than capable of challenging the Beavers and nabbing another Pac-10 series win.
“The only upsets in this conference are the teams on the losing end,” Cruz said. “They’re the ones upset. Anyone can beat anyone on any given day, and I don’t mean that as a cliché. That’s just the facts.”

The No. 2 USC men’s tennis team is two steps closer to a three-peat this weekend, snagging consecutive home wins to move on to the third round of the NCAA championships.
Tough road · Junior Daniel Nguyen looks to lead the Trojans, who are two victories away, to their third consecutive NCAA championship. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans hosted the first two rounds of the tournament, entering the postseason with a 14-match win streak, and walked away with a pair of 4-0 victories Friday and Saturday against Sacramento State and No. 31 San Diego.
Next up for USC is No. 16 Georgia Tech on Thursday at noon in Palo Alto, Calif. The Yellow Jackets earned this trip to the round of 16 for the first time since 1994.
“You just want to win,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “Winning gives you confidence and that’s the bottom line. You need momentum and winning gives you momentum.”
In Friday’s play, after winning two of three doubles matches to secure the doubles point against Sacramento State, the teams played out three singles matches before USC sealed the deal. Freshman Ray Sarmiento finished first, beating Sacramento State’s Javier Millan 6-2, 6-1. Junior Daniel Nguyen closed second, with a straight set 6-3, 6-2 win against Marko Starcevic.
For Nguyen the wins were more than just pocketed victories. They mark a personal success that has been hard fought but warmly welcomed.
“I think I’m playing my best tennis right now, both mentally and physically,” Nguyen said. “I’m playing NCAA tennis.”
Ultimately, being able to contribute to his team is most important to Nguyen, who was an integral part of the 2009 and 2010 back-to-back national championships teams.
He made clear that the team was ready to go and back for more.
“We’re ready and we’re coming back to win that title,” Nguyen said.
Saturday’s competition against San Diego was similarly successful. Nguyen and Sarmiento did not complete their doubles match after the Trojans’ No. 2 pair Poldma and sophomore J.T. Sundling, and No. 1 pair Johnson and Gomez pocketed 8-3, 8-4 wins against the Torero’s Dean Jackson and Patrick Pohlmann, and Nikola Bubnic and Nils Schive, respectively.
USC entered singles play with the doubles point in hand.
Lucassen was dominant at No. 6, winning 6-0, 6-1 against Abdullah Hashem. Nguyen won his second consecutive singles match in the competition, defeating Bubnic 6-2, 6-2, to bring USC within one match of another 4-0 win.
Poldma, Johnson, and Sarmiento were still battling mid-match when Gomez, playing at
No. 5, secured the team’s spot with a 6-1, 6-3 victory against Thibaut Visy.
As the team goes deeper into the NCAAs, Smith said it’s all about staying “loose.”
“We’re focused and we’re ready,” Smith said. “It’s just a matter of staying sharp.”
Nguyen echoed that sentiment, feeling confident in the team’s ability to stay on top.
“Each match is going to be one of the toughest of our lives,” Nguyen said. “But we’ve prepared well, and we’re ready.”

It was spring break in Las Vegas, but the USC men’s golf team wasn’t having any fun.
The Trojans had just finished in a tie for 12th in a field of 15 teams at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters, their seventh straight tournament placing outside of the top three.
Dominant · Sophomore Martin Trainer has come on strong as of late, posting three top-five finishes and also notching a Pac-10 individual title. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
“I was frustrated,” said USC coach Chris Zambri. “I was afraid I wasn’t doing the right things as a coach. It makes you wonder. I think everyone was frustrated.”
Over the last two months, however, the Trojans have been a completely different team. Four straight top-three finishes ended three weeks ago as USC won the school’s first Pac-10 championship since 2007, giving the team a newfound confidence heading into this week’s NCAA regional championships.
So what changed for the Trojans?
“I think the biggest turnaround has been in the play of [sophomore] Martin [Trainer] and [sophomore] Sam Smith,” Zambri said. “Those guys have made a huge difference for us.”
Trainer finished outside of the top 20 individually in the first three tournaments of spring. Since then, he’s posted three straight top-five finishes, including a victory at the Pac-10 championships earlier this month. Trainer shot 5-under-par for four rounds and won a seven-hole playoff with Oregon State’s Alex Moore to win the Pac-10 individual title.
“It felt like all of our hard work just started to pay off at once,” Trainer said. “I started playing really well and then guys like Sam and [freshman] Jeff [Kang] really started stepping up. We’ve come a long way.”
Smith has also turned in three top 10 finishes in the spring, including an eighth-place showing at the Pac-10 tournament.
The sophomores will lead USC, now ranked No. 20 in the nation, at the 13-team NCAA Regional Championships on Thursday through Saturday at the Farms Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
“I’ve played there a couple times,” junior Steve Lim said. “Our ball striking needs to be solid because there are a lot of hazards out there.”
The five lowest scoring teams from the regional will advance to next month’s NCAA championships in Stillwater, Okla. The other top teams in this week’s field include No. 4 UCLA, No. 10 Texas, No. 28 San Diego (which will be playing on its home course) and No. 32 Ohio State.
The Trojans lineup will also feature Kang, who finished third at the ASU Thunderbird Invitational last month and fifth at the Pac-10 tournament.
Lim, the only upperclassman in USC’s regular lineup, has been a model of consistency throughout the season, not having finished outside of the top-30 in his last eight events.
Lim pointed to the Callaway Collegiate Match Play tournament as the turning point in the season for the Trojans, where only a week after the disappointing result in Las Vegas, they finished in third place.
“We’re really confident now,” Lim said. “We just want to play now and we’re ready to smash other teams.”
The biggest surprise is that the Trojans have been playing so well without a huge contribution from sophomore T.J. Vogel, who was a freshman All-American last season. Vogel posted two top-five finishes in the fall season but hasn’t cracked the top 30 in five events this spring.
“He hasn’t got going yet this season the way he did last year,” Zambri said. “But there’s time left in the season and he’s certainly talented enough to do it.”
Zambri is confident in the depth of his young squad going into the most important tournaments of the college season.
“We’re in a good position in that [Vogel] is now playing in the No. 5 spot for us,” Zambri said about his team’s depth. “We’re pretty good when T.J. Vogel — the player that he is — is playing five for us.”
The Trojans will tee it up in the first round Thursday beginning at 8 a.m.

The criticisms have snowballed.
Over the past year, since the words “lack of institutional control” and “failure to monitor” became ingrained into the mind of the average college sports fan, the NCAA has been under intense scrutiny. That’s no surprise.
From USC’s two-year bowl ban to Ohio State’s “Tattoo Five” and, most recently, Boise State’s notice of infractions, decisions made by the NCAA have been placed under a microscope, blasted on blogs, message boards and sports talk radio shows.
No matter the outcome, no matter the extent to which the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions went to explain the rationale behind its rendered decision, the number of criticisms has remained inordinate.
The commonly shared belief: Just change something.
Subsequently, in an effort to combat a public relations problem on par with last year’s BP oil spill, the NCAA held an educational enforcement experience last week — a mock investigation with 25 media members in attendance, assuming the roles of investigators and members of the COI in a fictitious case. The event was similar to the annual mock selection show held each February to shed light on how 68 college teams are selected in basketball’s March Madness.
The genesis for the newest project came as a result of a need for transparency, as well as “to educate critics,” according to a press release run on NCAA.org after years in which the enforcement process had become increasingly scrutinized by the public.
“To the extent that we can provide you and your colleagues with better information, we want to do it,” NCAA President Mark Emmert told the ensemble of reporters in attendance.
But underlying its efforts to promote transparency and “enlighten” the public, namely the two dozen sportswriters in attendance, was a tone that appeared all too condescending.
In hosting an event aimed at educating and fostering a better understanding of the enforcement process, Emmert and other NCAA officials appeared to seemingly belittle the criticisms raised over the past year.
In a sense, the premise behind the event suggests that those criticizing the NCAA, compliance and enforcement are uneducated about a process far too complicated for basic understanding.
No doubt, it’s a confusing ordeal, nuanced in several respects from understanding the makeup of the process from the initial investigation to the COI’s eventual decision.
But the complexity does not invalidate the criticisms.
In spite of the intricacies, the procedure is still understandable in layman’s terms, from the fielding of tips, to the fact findings, to the witness interviews, to the meetings with the COI. It’s not a criminal trial, as the NCAA is always quick to point out, but the steps carried out are similar in some respects.
The NCAA has an enforcement staff, composed of 38 employees, charged with the responsibility of conducting the investigation, much like a detective team. If enough information is gathered, schools, as well as coaches, players and others, can be served with a notice of infractions, where they will then be asked to meet with the COI, acting in effect as a jury that eventually determines the fate of the charged school.
Understanding the process is not an impossible task despite the insinuation from Emmert and the NCAA.
In short, the complex nature should not be used as an avenue by the NCAA to shield its self from well deserved criticism. Nobody disputes its nuances.
As outlined before, the real problem lies in the discrepancy in the COI’s decisions, not in a complex process incapable for the average fan and beat writer to grasp.
And that was not explained at the mock session.
No matter how transparent the NCAA hopes enforcement can become, it has still yet to answer how certain decisions are eventually rendered.
“When it came time to dole out the punishments, I found it strange and surprising we weren’t given any official sentencing guidelines or case precedents,” said SI.com writer Stewart Mandel, who was in attendance. “While we were given a list of available penalties (scholarships, postseason ban, etc.), we essentially had carte-blanche power to make up whatever numbers or length we deemed fit based on the severity of the crimes — which in itself is a subjective judgment.”
That has been the main criticism, not how information is gathered.
You can find receipts that prove players received extra benefits. You can uncover recordings or emails demonstrating a coach was fully aware of a certain improprieties.
But determining a fair way to punish schools and rule, violators need some sort of consistency, not just the whim of a COI member, because as we saw with the Reggie Bush, giving a Notre Dame athletic department official free reign to bring out the postseason ban hammer might not be the best idea.
There needs to be some uniformity in the decisions process, and no matter how complex the process is this still needs to change.

The USC women’s water polo team, appearing in its eighth straight NCAA tournament, fell short in defending its national championship and finished fourth after losing to crosstown rival UCLA in the third-place game.
Not enough · Senior driver Joelle Bekhazi finished with two goals against UCLA, but USC lost 6-5 in the third-place game. For her strong play, Bekhazi was named to the NCAA All-Tournament Second Team. - Daily Trojan file photo 
USC entered the NCAA tournament as the No. 4 seed in the eight-team field. Matched up against No. 3 UCLA, the Women of Troy recovered from an early deficit, as senior driver Joelle Bekhazi scored two goals to put USC on top in the first period.
Each team converted on three 6-on-5 opportunities during the match, and it was the senior leadership of two-meters Sarah Van Norman and Kristen Dronberger that played an instrumental role in the team’s offensive attack.
In a back-and-forth contest after halftime, the two squads traded goals until UCLA knotted the score up at five goals apiece going into the final period.
The Women of Troy failed to capitalize on their 6-on-5 opportunities in the final period. Finally, it was the Bruins who broke through, as KK Clark scored on a lob shot to put the Bruins ahead 6-5 with just under four minutes remaining in the contest.
The Women of Troy had multiple opportunities to force the match into overtime, but they failed to convert.
“We didn’t get the result we wanted, but we played hard and it was a good experience for our younger girls,” Bekhazi said.
The Women of Troy began tournament play against No. 5 UC Irvine. USC did not trail during the entire match, and pulled away with a 14-9 victory.
After defeating the Anteaters, USC was set to play top-seeded Stanford in the semifinals of the competition. In a rematch of last year’s national title game, the Women of Troy fell 8-4. Sophomore driver Dominique Sardo scored two of USC’s goals, while Stanford’s Kim Krueger contributed three goals for the Cardinal.
Despite falling to both the Cardinal and Bruins, USC has high hopes for next season. Although the Women of Troy will lose two of its top scorers in Bekhazi and Dronberger, several underclassman and juniors throughout the year had integral roles in the team’s success.
“The juniors are going to have to step up a lot [next season] and I think the freshman class, the new girls, we got a few good people,” Bekhazi said. “It’s going to be interesting and it’s still going to be a young team since there will only be two seniors.”

Just days removed from commencement and the end of spring semester, the university has begun work on nearly 50 summer construction projects, many of which will lead to street and building closures already affecting life on campus this summer.
The summer construction schedule began Monday and is scattered throughout campus.
Street closures, as a result of construction, include McClintock Avenue between Downey and Hellman ways and Childs Way between Trousdale Parkway and Figueroa Street.
Graphic by Jovanna Tosello | Summer Trojan
Downey will also be inaccessible near the Hedco Neuro Sciences Building.
Major renovations, or “capital construction development” projects, are planned at 22 different locations, including Kaprielian Hall and Stoops Hall, as well as starting construction on the new student health center.
Reaction to the increased construction and street closure has been mixed from students who will need to access campus during the summer months.
Kamron Hakemy, a junior majoring in international relations [global business] who lives at Tuscany Apartments on Figueroa Street, said the street closures would affect the time it takes to get onto
campus.
“Even when USC isn’t in session, the campus is very populated,” Hakemy said. “The closures will definitely make the trip to campus longer.”
Hakemy also mentioned the reduced traffic pattern on campus would likely cause increased traffic concerns on the streets surrounding USC.
Other students were more accepting of the summer construction and closures and welcomed the improvements to campus.
“I’ve already been warned that USC means the ‘University of Summer Construction,’ so I’m prepared for it,” said Nakul Joshi, a sophomore majoring in computer science and taking classes this summer. “I’m confident that every effort has been made to keep it safe.”
The construction and street closures could also impact tourists and prospective undergraduates, according to students.
“Tour guides are not able to show visitors as much of the campus and buildings as they’d like to,” said Preksha Daga, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering who will work at the Office of Admissions this summer.
Gate 3 (McCarthy Way) will also be partially inaccessible until June 30, according to an email sent to the university community by USC Transportation.
All road closures and traffic restrictions will be lifted by August 15 at the latest, according to the email.
To USC Parent: In LA it’s the City’s responsibility to fix the side-walks, which explains why they are utterly terrible.  USC can only take care of what’s on its campus and cannot fix the ones not on its property, even though they push the city to do so.
Even the ones in front of USC dorms are the responsibility of the City of LA and by jurisdiction aren’t allowed to be worked on except by the City of LA, which according to a LA Times article they cut funding for repairs due to budget cuts.  It’s not just the sidewalks at USC, its the entire city.
Ken:   If you wanted it fixed by the City, you will be dead before the City gets around to it.  So it is really the responsibility of adjacent property owner.  The City gives out free permits to fix sidewalks.
BTW:  I am not amused by the two small stick figures on top of WPH in your map graphic.
Can USC PLEASE fix the sidewalks (or work with the city to do so) north of campus.  Our son, a scholarship athlete, tripped on a hole recently and was injured in broad daylight (no, he was not inebriated).   My husband and I walk around all the time and are astonished at the poor condition of the sidewalks just north of campus.  These areas are a lawsuit waiting to happen.

As my family sat in anticipation, awaiting their daughter and sister’s name to be called, they were approached by a young Middle Eastern man. He asked if his mother could sit with my family.
Noticing my brothers’ uncertainty, the gentleman in his black robe and class of 2011 sash assured them, “We are from Iran. But don’t worry, we are not terrorists.”
With a quick laugh and a smile, my family made room for his mother. USC’s 128th commencement ceremony was a day of celebration, a day where people of different backgrounds came together to support the efforts of their diligent children, a feeling we should all embrace.

Sarrah Shahawy, president of the USC Interfaith Council and valedictorian, mentioned in her speech that USC is one of the most religiously diverse campuses nationwide.
We have learned to accept and to love others of differing religions and cultures and to add them to the melting pot that is USC. As diversity grows in California, the religious debate heightens in the region where the woman my family sat with at graduation came from.
As my father spent the last three days in Bahrain for business, he frequently updated my family on his travels and told me of his experiences.
He told us a man he became acquainted with on the street said the hot-button issue in Bahrain at the moment is not concern for a potential revolutionist uprising, rather the uncertainty of Iran’s regional motives.
The Bahraini people fear, as do most others in Persian Gulf states, Iran’s growing strength, nuclear plans, allegiance to terrorist organizations and differences in Islam ideology.
In the Carnegie Papers, Marina Ottaway, an expert in the Middle East, said, “Iran is a predominantly [Shiite] country ruled by [Shiite] clerics in a region that is predominantly Sunni and governed by Sunni rulers.”
This is a reality that causes great tension among Muslims in the gulf. But Iranian leaders spread worry even past the gulf; the concern for national security hits the entirety of the Middle East. For example, former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, along with King Abdullah II of Jordan, has raised alarm over the dominance of Shiism.
The king has warned of an emerging “[Shiite] crescent,” and Mubarak has declared that the Arab-Shiites are more loyal to Iran than to their own states. In spite of this, perhaps in the case of Bahrain, a country ruled by the Sunni majority, the minority of Shiites is resentful of its officials because they face widespread discrimination from the majority.
Unfortunately, we are not blind to the fact that this religious warfare exists within the United States. Students at USC live among Sunni and Shiite Muslims in addition to so many other religions and their sects.
Whether one person is right or wrong should no longer be a question of acceptance and security. This might be an idealistic point of view, but this is the hope I believe our graduates hold, that we can somehow find a way to one day live together in harmony, as we did on the day of graduation.
This story is a thank you to my university; it’s a thank you for the security, receptiveness and universal acceptance the Trojan Family has afforded us. This is the true beauty of America, a beauty that we can celebrate at a university graduation and realize the dissimilarity of values no longer matter while love, approbation and joy become precedent.

let me tell you this story about Bahrain Shiites.. back at the 70s they were asked if they wanted to be part of Iran, they refused. Shiites loyalty is to Bahrain and will remain to be. even the current Bahrain foreign minister said it in a press conference that the loyalty of Bahrain Shiites is to Bahrain
and in fact Shiites are the majority in Bahrain you can ask anyone and they will tell you this, even the international media is reporting that Bahrain Shiites are the majority in the country, the percentage is 60-70% of the population
and if this is about the revolution that started in 14th February then you should know this: there was Sunnis along with Shiites in the protests, because they all wanted more freedom and more rights.
Zahraa, just because they participated in aportest does NOT mean they wanted more freedom and more rights.
Need I remind you of the Tehran protests of 1979 when people took to the streets demanding the Shah’s ouster?  This led to Ayatollah Khomeini’s rise to power and this led to far fewer rights and freedoms for the people of Iran.
Since Ayatollah Khomeini’s rise to power the number of Zoroastrians, gays, Christians, Sunnis, Bahais killed has increased many fold and the freedoms and rights of people have only been further reduced such that today Iran is one of the MOST repressive countries in the world.
Meanwhile in Egypt the majority of the protestors want the Muslim Brotherhood to lead the country in the future, and if this comes true (and it almost certainly will) then kiss the few freedoms Egyptians currently enjoy good-bye; and even worse kiss what remains of the ancient Coptic Christian community good-bye too.
A commentor or two mentioned the “Arab Spring” a misleading term for the revolutions happening in the Middle East and North Africa.  What is really happening has nothing to do with democracy and everything to do with raw power plays.
In Egypt the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood is winning the day.  This is little different than what Happened in Iran in 1979 when the dicatator the Shah of Iran was unceremoniously kicked out and was replaced by Khomeini.  And in the other countries any movement toward “democracy” are all but invisible.  It’s the Islamists carrying the day in Libya as well.
Could someone explain for me why Muslims kill (and all one need do is read the papers to know this is TRUE) anybody and everybody?
In Thailand they are killing Buddhists on a regular basis.
In Pakistan, Bangladesh and India they kill Hindus on a regular basis.
In Iraq, Nigeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Sudan, and in many other countries they kill Christian on a regular basis.
Throughout the Muslim world women are killed on a regular basis.
Throughout the Muslim world homosexuals are killed on a regular basis.
Zoroastrians, Black Africans, Assyrians, Copts, Chaldeans, athiests, apostates are also killed on a regular basis.
Jews they’ll kill without remorse if they can get their hands on them.
And then the icing on the cake is how Muslims kill one another apparently without a second thought.  Sunnis killing Shi’ites in Bahrain.  Sunnis killing Shi’ites in Saudi Arabia,  Shi’ites killing Sunnis in Iraq and elsewhere.
I don’t get it, Anne, why is life seemingly so cheap over there?
Not one of us can ever “know it all”, but this Anne is putting forth a snippet of the whole for us to consider.  Those who have something to say might remember that if you can’t be positive and constructive in your criticism, you are really not helping the debate.  As young people enter the “great conversation of ideas” that has been going on for centuries, let us be considerate of one another, even as if we were sitting next to them at the graduation.  Be a neighbor.  Everything really important we learned in Kindergarten.
@alanmirs….@buggers…. terrorizing a girl are you? Copying & pasting the same silly comments. Typical anarchists or their supporters from Bahrain that do not understand another opinion.
Anne, you are right. You are trying to promote love and co-existence while these guys do not understand that. To them the pro-democracy movement was just a cover – for dominance of their sect and the resurgence of Iran. Nor do these guys understand democracy.
Mubarak quoted that the Shia can never be trusted and that their loyalties will always be with their parent country Iran. Research further and you will see that Bahrain of 525,000 people are equally split between the Sunni & Shia. There are also indigenous Jew & Christian population though. Did you know that the Ambassador of Bahrain to the US is a Jew?
A another point to note is that Bahrain has an expatriate population of 600,000+ who outnumber the Bahrainis put together. The anarchists hate the expatriates to the core and have already hacked 6 people to death during the course of their anarchist revolution. 
Last night (05/17/11) they ran over 9 policemen, 4 are serious and almost dead. 
Anne, please do not loose hope. Along with the actual learning process keep up your spirit and your goodness. There is still hope for the world with the likes of you. God Bless you.
Hey Anne! I don’t think u should thank you university as obviously u learned nothing! please try to do a little research before you start writing! Did the University reply to this letter? they should, it is embarrassing!
Perhaps you didn’t get the hype about the Arab Spring but just in case you didn’t…
1. The dictator, Mubarak, has fallen because he was a dictator and his views and opinions didn’t represent his country (his views weren’t trusted by Egyptians, why are you quoting them?)
2. Jordan’s absolute Monarch has shuffled his Cabinet following massive protests (why are you quoting him on regional affairs?)
3. Bahrain is a Shiite majority ruled by a Sunni minority. Unlike Egypt and Tunisia, the Bahraini army and security forces are entirely imported and so they do not flip like the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions
4. The Bahraini people fear getting fired from state and private jobs, tortured, and arrested at 3 am and being put on trial in a sham military court for protesting…not Iran’s regional and sectarian ambitions.
If you’re going to write a “thank you story” to your university that gave you a degree in politics…please avoid embarrassing them by demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of middle

USC has a reputation for being dead in the summer.
Most students are gone, and the ones that remain on campus often do not hang around with a full course load; instead, they stay to take that one lingering class needed to graduate on time.
Jovanna Tosello | Summer Trojan
Unfortunately, USC’s summertime financial aid policies don’t reflect that.
It’s long been a goal of the USC administration to cement the university’s status as a residential school rather than a commuter one. Although summer financial aid is not strictly a matter of who lives where, it remains a policy that drives students away from campus and into the arms of other institutions, which at the end of the day is the opposite of what the administration is trying to achieve.
The university currently requires a minimum of six units before undergraduate students are eligible to receive the financial support they would otherwise, meaning students taking just one — or sometimes even two — classes must pay the $1,360-per-unit price tag out of pocket, or else temporarily say goodbye to their alma mater in favor of a local community college that charges them 1/50th of the price.
This causes students enough grief in and of itself, as they are forced to either scramble to pay the exorbitant USC fee or wrestle with an extra commute — and subsequent gas prices for the lucky ones with cars — for the privilege of going to a less challenging and less prestigious school.
With budget cuts causing many California community colleges to place much of their curricula in moth balls this year, students are finding even the latter option a struggle.
Andria Kowalchik, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, decided to take a Spanish class at USC this summer to finish her language requirement, only to find the classes she could barely afford to begin with were already full.
“Finding a Spanish 3 class at one of the community colleges was much harder than I thought it would be,” Kowalchik said. “West L.A. [College] canceled classes because of budget cuts and Santa Monica [Community College] didn’t offer it. The only place I could find was Pasadena City College … which means I’m going to have to commute every day and spend a lot of money on gas. I can’t even register until June 3.”
Joshua DeMilta, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and political science, decided to take a summer class under the original impression he would be able to receive aid.
“Six units as a requirement [for financial aid] is ridiculous,” DeMilta said. “I only needed to take one class. … There was no way I could pay [the $1,360].”
DeMilta decided to enroll in Pasadena City College after learning about its vastly more economical $26-per-unit classes through Kowalchik. But he’s still not happy with it. He now faces a commute, a class that will likely teach him less useful material and the prospect of only receiving pass/no pass credit.
It’s time USC’s summer financial aid mirrored the demographic of students requesting it. Although undergraduates have likely struggled with the issue in the past, they at least had the option of turning to the community college of their choice. Now, thanks to budget cuts, students are being forced to travel far and wide in search of the one or two remaining colleges still offering the classes they desperately need to graduate.
The students are disgruntled and the times are changing. Hopefully next year lonely summer students will have the benefit of greater options for taking classes at the university they chose to begin with.

You need to differentiate what is a school requirement and a federal requirement.  To be eligible for financial aid in the summer there are federal limits which is one reason for the “at least half time status of 6 units” .
