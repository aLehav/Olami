University faculty and students came together on Wednesday to discuss the global challenges the United States’ next president will face in an event hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute for Politics and the Political Student Assembly — part of a series called “It’s Our Election Too.”
Panelists included senior correspondents for the student publication Glimpse from the Globe Luke Phillips and Kshitij Kumar; Robert English, associate professor of international relations; and Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute.
The discussion began with a commentary on how the role of foreign policy in this election cycle differs from previous years.
“This year, the gulf between what’s being promised … and what [candidates] are really likely to do, what they will be able to do in the real world … seems to me wider than ever,” English said. “Some would say the level of irresponsibility and recklessness is greater than ever.”
But Kumar expressed concern over campaign promises that would make for ill-advised foreign policy initiatives in reality, particularly those that focus on isolationism.
“It worries me because that’s what the American people are going to come to expect,” Kumar said.
Schnur agreed, additionally referring to the prominence of American isolationism that has been gaining momentum recently.
“Outside of rooms like these, where smart young people know how important these international issues are, the wall-builders are winning,” Schnur said.
The topic of discussion shifted to the idea of the war on terror and its role in presidential campaigns. Schnur talked about the importance of how candidates are portraying Islam and acts of terror in this election.
“The distinction between condemning radical Islam, and Islam is of absolutely critical importance,” Schnur said. “An increasing number of our political leaders are making a point of drawing the distinction, but the loudest voices in the political debate are not.”
Phillips responded by saying that the socioeconomic unrest in the Middle East is to blame for much of radical Islamism rather than the religion itself. He said that a good foreign policy should take that into consideration.
“I’m not saying it’s not important to be fighting a moral war,” Phillips said. “But I think something that a true leader will have to tell [Americans] eventually is that because of events that are out of [anyone’s] control, there’s a tendency among members of the Muslim community to get radicalized because of forces that are happening to the Muslim community.”
English said that with those forces and the efforts the United States has made so far, it’s not possible to transition quickly to an isolationist policy.
“Since 2002, … we have spent $4 to 5 trillion with what some would say is remarkably little gain,” English said. “We have now crossed 1 million casualties. These guys are acting like isolationists, as if you can just throw bombs and stay home, but you can’t. It’s just fantasies.”

Stephen Tropiano, a professor at Ithaca College and alumnus of the School of Cinematic Arts, spoke Wednesday afternoon at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on the history of the portrayal of the LGBT community in the media. His speech focused particularly on LGBT representation in television and closely followed his book The Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV.
Tropiano showed multiple segments throughout television history where the LGBT community was mentioned and touched on modern shows like Orange is the New Black in order to comment on the positive and negative construction of homosexuals in the media.
He started by tracing the change in the discourse of the LGBT community from the ancient Greek era to the modern era in religious, medical, legal and cultural spaces. According to Tropiano, ancient Greeks did not have a categorization for someone who was gay, and that the modern world’s categorization has come from stereotypes and social myths.
“In [ancient Greece], there wasn’t anything like homosexuality,” Tropiano said. “It wasn’t called that because sexuality was more about your position in Athens, for example. They didn’t really have the categories that we have, but as we go over time into the 19th and into the 20th century, we have become more increasingly categorized.”
Tropiano briefly summarized the history of the LGBT community in America and how the rest of society constructed it. Following World War II, members of the gay community were discriminated against for being in collusion with communist sympathizers, and it wasn’t until 1973 that the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of disorders.
One of the first references in television to the LGBT community came from a PBS newscast that attempted to explain what it means to be gay. Tropiano argued that many of the initial non-fiction reports on members of the gay community immediately categorized them and perpetuated today’s stereotypes on television.
“They had titles like ‘Homosexuals and the Problems That They Present,’ ‘Homosexuals Who Stalk and Molest Children,’ ‘Introduction to the Problem of Homosexuality’ because homosexuality was always considered a problem,” Tropiano said. “The stereotype of the homosexual child molester are two things that were often conflated and two things that are obviously very different. The idea of equating a homosexual with a pedophile actually continued when they dealt with the subject on television.”
Tropiano categorized the portrayal of members of the gay community in television into different genres. He further elaborated on how these portrayals harmed the LGBT community. He concluded this analysis of different genres by describing how they have played a role in both informing the public about differing sexualities as well as perpetuating the social myths surrounding the LGBT community.
“Television has played somewhat of a dual role because on one hand, it has perpetuated or promoted false social myths and stereotypes, but on the other hand, it has actually done a lot of good in terms of subverting it,” Tropiano said.
In more recent representations of the LGBT community, controversy has arisen in television regarding what can and cannot be shown. Tropiano pointed to edgier dramas like Soap and Picket Fences to illustrate some of the problems that arose with the portrayal of the LGBT community.
“One of the problems that shows ran into with gay characters was [that] if you are going to put a gay character as a regular on a show -— and that began in the 1970s — that presents sort of a problem, because you couldn’t do what you could do with a heterosexual with a gay man or even a lesbian,” Tropiano said.
As Tropiano moved into more modern issues in streaming services and the internet, a discussion emerged on how the LGBT community is depicted in the current media space. Tropiano explained that increased LGBT representation has occurred because of the creative freedom that streamed shows have that broadcast shows do not and also because of the changing culture.
“The reason why people are flocking to Amazon and Hulu as well as HBO and so on is they are given more creative freedom,” Tropiano said. “They aren’t looking over people’s shoulders. I also do think part of it is because the culture has changed, and I think that society has changed.”

Scouts poured into Cromwell Field for USC’s annual Pro Day as the Trojans’ NFL hopefuls went through drills, the sun beating down on them on a bright Wednesday morning.
Seventeen participants took part in the event, but most of the eyes were on junior linebacker Su’a Cravens, who is projected to be drafted in the early second round,  although whether teams consider him a linebacker or a safety is still in question.
Cravens ran the 40-yard dash in 4.65 seconds, above average for a linebacker but slow for a safety. He did not run the 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine last month, opting to improve upon his time for Pro Day. He also posted a vertical leap of 30.5 inches, more than three inches higher than he reached at the combine.
“I think I did everything I could do,” Cravens said. “Now it’s just sharpening my skills in the drills they wanted me to do today and just getting ready for whatever team drafts me.”
The preparation has paid off. Cravens said he has interviews set up with four to five teams. His time in the 40-yard dash was third among all Trojans, behind senior fullback Soma Vainuku (4.59 seconds) and senior running back Tre Madden (4.56 seconds).
Madden also led USC with a 10-foot broad jump and was third with a 33.5-inch vertical jump. With impressive numbers across the board, Madden’s only question mark remains his durability; he was plagued by injury throughout his USC career and missed the Holiday Bowl last season after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery in December.
“[NFL teams] ask about the injury,” Madden said. “That’s the biggest thing. I feel like showing my athleticism and how healed I am and how fresh I feel is answering questions, and my durability is going to be fine.”
The senior, who has interest from the Cowboys and Saints, felt good about his showcase at Pro Day.
“It was an all-around good day,” Madden said. “The performance I put out really impressed some of the scouts.”
Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler, a projected late round pick, did nothing to lower his prospects of being selected. Kessler wasn’t flashy, but was crisp and accurate on most of his passes.
Senior cornerback Kevon Seymour and senior defensive tackle Antwaun Woods were limited in participation. Woods has been dealing with a pectoral strain suffered at the combine  and pulled up short during his second 40-yard dash with a sore hamstring.
While scouts were abundant, there were no NFL head coaches. Miami Dolphins General Manager Chris Grier and Oakland Raiders’ defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. were among those at Pro Day.
Cravens claimed he was not nervous about finding out where he will next call home.
“At the end of the day, if a team picks you, it’s a blessing,” Cravens said. “No matter where you go [in the draft], you should be grateful. It’s all in God’s plan. You just succeed, and you’ll be at the top one day, so it doesn’t matter what pick you go at in the draft.”
The NFL draft is a little more than a month away — April 28-30 — in Chicago.
Staff writer Josh Cohen contributed to this report.
Correction: This article previously stated that Madden had a 10-inch broad jump. He had a 10-foot broad jump. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Madden led USC with a 10-inch broad jump…we may have found our team’s weakness…with this correction, we may go unde-‘feet’-ed next season.

Over spring break, the men’s volleyball team (6-14, 4-12 MPSF) picked up two non-conference straight-set sweeps against Concordia and Holy Names, their first back-to-back victories of 2016.
They return to MPSF play this week as they head up to No. 5 Stanford (15-3, 13-3 MPSF) tonight and then over to No. 6 Pepperdine (11-7, 10-7 MPSF) on Saturday, both at 7 p.m.
Playing with a higher level of aggressiveness has a been a recent key for the team. It’s something senior libero Brooks Varni has seen help the team.
“I think we’re playing more free and loose,” Varni said. “That’s definitely coming from the coaches telling us to be more aggressive.”
Head coach Jeff Nygaard has been implementing this aggressiveness in all different aspects of the team’s play.
“We’re past the point of pettiness, we’re past the point of excuses,” Nygaard said. “We either buy in 100 percent now or we make this even harder.”
Most notably, Nygaard’s main goal for the team is to put in that aggression from behind the service line.
“We have the arms to affect other teams consistently,” Nygaard said. “But we have to smash through the hurdles that prohibit us from being aggressive at that point.”
When it comes to serving, a 1-to-3 ace-to-error ratio means you’re serving well, and that’s what the team will serve in practice. Nygaard notes that is a more assertive stance than they typically serve.
Nygaard highlighted how a high level of serving will keep the Trojans on point against the highly ranked opponents in their upcoming matches.
“Medium serves, from this point moving forward, do nothing but put [the opponent] in a rhythm, you don’t want good teams in a rhythm,” Nygaard said. “You want to disrupt that rhythm and there’s only one way to do that, and that’s to serve aggressive.”
Sophomore setter Jack Yoder said the team has already adopted an overall assertive mindset.
“That aggressive nature allows us to go out there and play the way we know how to play,” Yoder said.
It’s a nature that’s allowing the team to work together on the court well.
“I think we’re definitely starting to build that chemistry on the court that we’ve been looking for all season,” Yoder said. “We definitely know our strengths and weaknesses.”
That chemistry showed in the Trojans’ wins over the break. In order to beat Stanford and then beat Pepperdine again, USC will have to focus on their side of the court and serve tough to take on their top-ranked opponents.
The last time the Trojans faced the Waves, USC upset Pepperdine for their first win of the season. Sophomore opposite Jon Rivera tallied a career-high 23 kills.
Later that week, the Trojans fell in four sets to the Cardinal. Rivera led USC with 13 kills. In the fourth set of that match, the Trojans only scored 8 points, their lowest in a non-fifth set since rally scoring era began in 2001.
The USC team playing now is one that’s much different from what it was in January. While the record might not be entirely reflective, they’ve been improving and on the verge of breaking their potential.
“We’ve been talking all along about peaking at the end and now we have the opportunity to do so,” Nygaard said. “So it’s in our hands, if we win the next six, which on paper it’s a challenge, but we totally could.”
Through this season, Nygaard has managed to remain optimistic. He’s eagerly looking forward to taking his team on the road and pushing them to play their best to close out the season.
“If we win those six, I think that puts us in a good position to get into the tournament,” Nygaard said. “Would you want to play a team that was 4-12 that’s won the last six against top-ranked opponents in the playoffs? Absolutely not. I think that’d be great. I could handle that.”
Nygaard is a dreamer. He coaches like he is half asleep. The team wins 5 out of 6 it will be some kind of resurrection.
Beating two no names was a joke. This program has reached near bottom since he joined the coaching staff and now
being head coach . Another pass the baton hire by Haden in his national search.

Selection Sunday rolled around a week ago and based on the draw, I would imagine that Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott was in a room somewhere jumping for joy and dishing out high-fives to his colleagues.
A record seven teams were tapped by the selection committee to join the 68-field team that made up the 2016 NCAA Tournament, headlined by the No. 1-seeded Oregon Ducks, who won both the Pac-12 regular season title and the conference tournament.
With the Pac-12 sending seven teams to the “Big Dance,” it sat atop the list with the other powerhouse conferences in the ACC, Big Ten and Big 12 for most schools in the tourney. Finally, it was believed that the “Conference of Champions,” as UCLA legend Bill Walton always says, was getting national recognition, despite the majority of its games being played past most people’s bed times on the other side of the country. It was the icing on the cake to one of the Pac-12’s most exciting conference tournaments in its history.
It’s all been downhill from there, though, as the selection committee did their part, but Pac-12 teams did not live up to their end of the bargain. Of the seven teams that earned bids, the only one that remains standing is top-seeded Oregon, which has a date with defending national champion Duke as the Sweet 16 tips off in Anaheim on Thursday.
It’s a marquee matchup that may very well define whether Oregon, and the Pac-12 by osmosis, was worthy of its No. 1 seed in the first place — most of the critics said otherwise, despite 28 combined regular season and conference tournament wins.
I had the pleasure of seeing Dana Altman’s team play on multiple occasions this past season and they have the size, length and depth to play into April (spoiler alert, I picked them to make the Final Four).
The jury may still be out on the Ducks, who have won 10 consecutive games, but it’s the other six teams who really let down the conference.
The league was on the wrong side of history, becoming the first league to lose five games as higher seeds in the Round of 64 since seeding began in 1979.
Aside from Oregon, the No. 3-seeded Utes were the only team to make it out of the first round, but only before being pummeled by No. 11-seeded Gonzaga in the Round of 32.
As most of us know, USC lost on a last-second layup in a game that it was in the driver’s seat for.
Cal, which was awarded its highest seed ever at No. 4, was upset by Hawaii. Oregon State and Colorado were knocked off by two formidable opponents, respectively, in VCU and UConn and Arizona, a team that was ranked as high as No. 7 in the AP Top 25, couldn’t keep up with a hot Wichita State team.
The selection committee gave Pac-12 teams the shot they earned and deserved for their performance in the regular season, but it seems like the opportunity given to them was taken for granted.
By getting knocked early in the tourney — most of them in games they were favored to win — they only confirmed the stereotype that West Coast teams, for the most part, can’t compete with the beasts of the East and the Midwest when it comes to March Madness.
Historically, the Pac-12 is, indeed, the “Conference of Champions,” boasting the most national titles of any other conference; the disclaimer being that a large majority of the conference’s 15 titles were derived from UCLA during the legendary John Wooden era.
It has been a while, however, since a team from the “Conference of Champions” came out on top. A Pac-12 team has yet to win it all in the 21st century and hasn’t since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats in 1997.
Unless Oregon can pull it off, it looks like that drought will continue for at least another year.
In 2016, the conference was as deep as it has been in recent memory, very similar to how it was during the football season.
Despite its fair amount of growth over the past few years, unless Pac-12 teams can perform in the postseason and advance to the sport’s grandest stage, when the masses tune in to watch the best play, it is only going to continue to be discounted as the league that just can’t get over the hump. The events that took place in the first round of March Madness were just a microcosm of that.

After falling in their first-round contest to the Providence Friars in the final seconds, the Trojans face another loss with the reported departures of junior forward Darion Clark and sophomore forward Malik Martin.
Clark and Martin are set to transfer from USC this offseason, according to Jon Rothstein of CBS Sports. USC has yet to confirm the report.
Rothstein also reported that sophomore guard Malik Marquetti would transfer as well; however, Marquetti announced on Twitter his decision to stay at USC.
“Just taking a test, minding my business,” Marquetti said in the tweet. “Get done and my phone was in shambles. No, I’m not transferring.”
However, both Clark and Martin seem to have referenced their departures via Twitter on Wednesday. Martin retweeted Rothstein’s report and Clark cryptically noted, “No worries this way. The big man is in my corner.”
In 2016, Clark was the Trojans’ best per-minute rebounder, averaging 2.4 minutes per rebound, with his 43 offensive rebounding ranking fourth on the team. From the floor, Clark was an accurate post-up shooter but was underutilized due to the step-up play of freshmen Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright.
A potential reason for his exit could be his lack of playing time amid injury. This season Clark averaged just 11.1 minutes per game after earning 22 minutes per game the previous year. As a result, Clark’s scoring production was cut in half as the Georgia native averaged 2.6 points per game as compared to 5.7 in 2014.
Most importantly, though, the loss of Clark marks the loss of USC’s biggest locker room motivator. Throughout their 2015-2016 campaign, Clark was a spark plug for the whole team, using his vocal and physical prowess to ignite the Trojans on and off the court.
“[Clark] is a monster,” redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt said to the Daily Trojan after the Oregon State game on March 2. “Just the energy, the way he talks. He competes every day in practice. Every time the ball goes up, you see him trying to get the rebound … it’s a spark plug. Every team needs that.”
Clark’s excellent rebounding ability, 6-foot-7, 220-pound frame and unrelenting energy will be a commodity at multiple Division I programs that are looking for a leader and a strong interior presence.
As for Martin, the former three-star recruit who earned offers from UConn, Miami and Louisville during high school, he will be looking to finish his final two collegiate seasons at another D-I program.
After getting his per-game minutes cut from 17.9 in 2014 to 6.6 in 2015, Martin’s production fell off drastically. In 27 games played, the sophomore averaged just 1.8 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.4 shot attempts per game following a freshman season of 5.2 points, 3.6 rebounds and 4.3 shots per game.
Martin has a lot of upsides with his 6-foot-11 height and rebounding abilities, and should receive offers from Power 5 conference teams.
In the meantime, the Trojans’ 2016 recruits Jonah Mathews, De’Anthony Melton and Harrison Henderson should replace the two forwards come next winter.

The men’s swimming and diving team has already had an accomplished season and is seeking more. They’ve lost only once in 10 dual meets, they swept their formidable Bay Area rivals — Cal and Stanford — for the first time since 1997, and they’re coming off a successful conference championship where they sent a vast array of swimmers to the podium. Starting Wednesday, the team has a chance to turn their excellent campaign into an unforgettable one.
The No. 9 Trojans begin their chase for the national championship in Atlanta this week, where they will face off against top conference rivals Cal and reigning Pac-12 champion Stanford, as well as other top-ranked teams in Georgia and reigning NCAA overall champion Texas.
USC opened the championships with a ninth-place finish in the 800-yard free relay on Wednesday.
Historically, the Trojans have fared well in the NCAA championships: USC has the fourth-most overall national championships nationwide, winning the title nine times from 1960-1977. Since the team’s first appearance in the NCAAs, Trojan swimmers have captured 120 event titles (98 individual and 22 relay titles), which is also the fourth-most in the country. Though USC hasn’t finished in the nation’s top-three overall since 1990, the Trojans have taken home four fourth-place finishes in that time, including a fourth-place finish at last year’s NCAAs.
For the Trojans to match or improve upon last year’s result, they’ll have to rise to the occasion without their top performer from last year’s championships. Recent alumnus Christian Quintero, who also represented Venezuela at the 2012 London Olympics, won an individual title in the 200-yard freestyle and helped lead USC to titles in the 400- and 800-yard freestyle relays. Without Quintero, the Trojans will have to rely on a host of young talent and experienced leadership to replace his point contributions.
Senior captains Ted Singley and Morten Klarskov and junior captain Reed Malone all come into this week’s action with postseason experience. Singley competed in last year’s NCAAs and returns this year to swim in three different events: the 500- and 1650-yard freestyle, as well as the 200-yard butterfly. Klarskov is set to swim in the relays, while Malone — who won the 500-and 200-yard freestyle at the Pac-12 Championships — will swim in both events at the NCAAs, as well as the 100-yard freestyle.
Junior Steven Stumph, who has won the conference championship in the 200-yard breaststroke twice, is seeded 10th in the event at the NCAAs. He will also compete in the 100-yard breaststroke as well as the 200-yard individual medley. Sophomore Ralf Tribuntsov, who won the 100-yard backstroke at the Pac-12 Championships, is seeded fifth in the event at the NCAAs; Tribuntsov will also swim the 100-yard freestyle and the 100-yard butterfly.
For the Trojans to make a strong impact at this year’s NCAAs, they will have to receive strong efforts from their exceptionally talented freshman class, led by the trio of Patrick Mulcare, Alex Valente, and Carsten Vissering.  Mulcare, who holds USC’s all-time record in the 200-yard backstroke, will swim in that event as well as the 400- and 200-yard individual medleys.  Valente has USC’s top time in the 100-yard butterfly for this season, and Vissering was USC’s top swimmer in the 100-yard breaststroke this year. Valente will also swim in the 100-yard backstroke and the 200-yard butterfly at the NCAAs, while Vissering will also compete in 200-yard breaststroke.
Trojan divers will also need to contribute to the overall effort, as senior Collin Pollard and sophomore Dashiell Enos will look to ride off the momentum of their individual conference titles in the platform and three-meter, respectively. Pollard scored twice in his first NCAA appearance last season, both on the one-meter and the platform.  Senior Deon Reid will compete as well; all three divers are returning for their second-consecutive NCAA appearances.
The Trojans aren’t seeded first in any events at this year’s NCAAs, but, as the team knows, it’s the results — and not the predictions — that matter.
USC head coach Dave Salo will lead the team from March 23-26 as the Trojans look to take home their first team title since 1977. All events will take place in Georgia Tech’s McAuley Aquatic Center in Atlanta.

The women’s lacrosse team defeated Dartmouth at McAlister Field on Wednesday by a score of 17-4.
The Women of Troy are now 8-0 on the season and have climbed to No. 8 in the country. Their blistering start has also set a school record for consecutive games won. The blowout win encapsulated the season so far, as the team exploded offensively while also playing stout defense.
This was actually a fairly close contest at halftime. The Big Green managed to hang with USC and only trailed 9-4 at the break. The Women of Troy blanked Dartmouth in the latter 30 minutes en route to yet another convincing win.
Junior attacker Michaela Michael improved her season goal tally to 32, as she continues to average an impressive 4 goals per game. Michael fired 10 shots in the game and also logged three assists. USC’s No. 2 continues to solidify her status as one of the nation’s top players, as her movement alone can distract defenses and free up opportunities for teammates.
Senior attacker Caroline deLyra also found the back of the net four times. The senior deLyra has proven to be a real threat in front of goal, but her playmaking ability is remarkable. An incredibly fluid player with and without the ball, deLyra has 20 assists through just eight games.
At the defensive end, sophomore netminder Gussie Johns had another strong outing. Johns has a strong line of defense in front of her, led by senior Courtney Tarleton. Tarleton scooped up a pair of ground balls and forced three turnovers against the Big Green.
Tarleton and fellow defender Nina Kelty kept talented Dartmouth middle Jaclyn Leto fairly quiet. The talented Leto scored 3 goals but Taryn Deck was the only other Dartmouth player who managed to beat Johns.
The team now prepares to face Oregon this weekend at home. Though the women’s lacrosse plays in the MPSF as opposed to in the Pac-12, there is still a special feel to a true conference game. The Ducks and Trojans have had some compelling battles in several sports in the 2015-2016 season alone. It will be yet another test for the top-10 Women of Troy, but this team is yet to drop a game this season.
The team will then travel to Fresno State to close out the month. It has been quite a month — and quite a season — for this team so far. USC is improving on seemingly flawless performances, crushing every team in its path at the moment.
For a program in just its fourth year of existence, this is remarkable. Head coach Lindsey Munday was prepared for Leto and Dartmouth on Wednesday, and she continues to keep her team on track as the season progresses.
The game against Oregon is set for this Sunday at McAlister Field at noon. It is their first MPSF home game and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.
They are a talented bunch with excellent coaching.  With Ms. Munday USC got it right!
Give her a raise, extend her contract – never lose her!

At 10-9, the baseball team has turned the corner after winning its past three games against strong pitching opponents Cal and Cal State Fullerton.
But junior outfielder Corey Dempster and junior infielder David Edson, who have progressed nicely after being inserted into the Trojans’ lineup versus Cal, will certainly have to maintain the team’s recent ability to generate runs and wins against talented pitchers when they travel to UC Santa Barbara, which is 16-3 and 11-1 at home.
USC defeated UCSB in the Lake Elsinore NCAA Regional 12-3 last year but lost both its games against the Gauchos in the regular season by 1 run. Coincidentally, players and coaches are desperately hoping to buck this 1-run-game trend this season, having already lost seven of 13 games that were decided by 1 run.
Subsequently, in a sport that can oftentimes be decided by one swing of the bat, players are perhaps rightfully optimistic about their ability to stay in games against strong pitching opponents. Further, they believe that if their own starting pitching staff can continue to accumulate wins and combine with their recent surge in hitting production, they will change those 1-run losses to wins and build upon their current 2-1 conference record.
“The [starting] pitchers are keeping us in the game, for the most part, but we have not been winning that 4-3 game; we lose 5-4,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “The fact that they are all 1-run games means that we need to maintain production from the offense and the pitchers need to win their battles.”
Hubbs hopes that this team’s recent win streak is the manifestation of significant lineup changes that he had to make in order to improve an offense that struggled to take advantage of scoring opportunities with runners on base and a starting pitching staff that had continuously failed to win their starts. Dempster and Edson were put into the hitting lineup, and sophomore pitcher Brad Wegman and redshirt junior pitcher Joe Navilhon made their first collegiate starts during Friday’s and Saturday’s Trojan victories against Cal.
After allowing 3 runs in the first inning on Friday, Wegman settled in and pitched five strong innings as the team answered with 3 runs in the bottom of the first and scored seven in the second to secure Wegman’s second victory of the season.
Navilhon followed that performance the following day by pitching four quality innings and allowing 2 runs. Hubbs was pleased with both pitchers, who succeeded in throwing strikes with four strikeouts each and minimized giving up free bases.
Hubbs has experimented with seven different starting pitchers already this season. Furthermore, freshman pitcher CJ Stubbs added to this current production from an influx of new talent when pitching six innings and only allowing 1 run in USC’s 3-2 win over Cal State Fullerton on Monday.
“I think we are doing a lot better at executing and getting contact,” Hubbs said. “When we have a guy in scoring position and when we are with a runner on third with less than two outs, over the past couple of weeks, we have been fantastic.”
Freshman first baseman Dillon Paulson believes that the recent contribution from freshman players comes from the help and bond they have received from the veterans on the team.
“I think that we are where we should have been at the start of the season,” Paulson said. “If we keep playing the way that we are playing now, there is no one that is able to beat us.”
The series against the Gauchos kicks off at 3 p.m. on Thursday at Santa Barbara. The teams play again at 3 p.m. on Friday, and the rubber match will be Saturday at 2 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

Shake Shack has long since been lauded as the East Coaster’s In-N-Out, but finally Angelenos can compare the two in the same city. The fast-food restaurant, which is well known for their grass-fed, hormone- and antibiotic-free hot dogs and burgers, started as a hot dog stand in Madison Square Park in Manhattan, but word spread quickly, and by 2004, a permanent store was opened in the park. Now 12 years later, Shake Shack has stores in 13 states and even has international locations in London, Istanbul and Dubai — but finally it’s Los Angeles’ turn.
The West Hollywood location opened March 15 with lines down the street, and now, a week on, the lines are still long. The line around lunchtime stretched along Santa Monica Boulevard, down the block toward La Cienega Boulevard and took over an hour to traverse. Ultimately, the food is good — although perhaps not worth waiting an hour.
Their beef patties used in their “ShackBurgers” are tender and juicy, while the American cheese is creamy and perfectly accents the meat. The lettuce and tomatoes are very fresh and bring a lightness to the burger.
The “’Shroom Burger” is definitely worth trying. A portobello mushroom is filled with muenster and cheddar cheese, covered with breadcrumbs, and fried. Served with lettuce, tomato and “ShackSauce,” all elements work together to create a truly mouth-watering burger. Even avid meat lovers won’t miss the protein.
The burgers are much smaller than standard fare, and with a cheeseburger priced at $5.29, it’s not cheap compared to many other places. For anyone with a healthy appetite, it’s definitely worth upgrading to a double patty for the extra $2.80 — especially after braving the line.
The crinkle-cut fries are tasty, but nothing to write home about. They’re not overly greasy and are nicely crisp but pretty standard. However, for an extra dollar, they will upgrade to cheese fries.
For dessert, Shake Shack offers frozen custard-based milkshakes, which are worth trying. The vanilla is particularly delectable, as the smooth custard flavor really shines through. Additionally, the restaurant supplies “concretes,” which are essentially just sundaes. The Shack Attack features chocolate custard, fudge sauce, salted caramel chocolate brownie, chocolate chunks and sprinkles. While it’s delicious, it melts quickly (perhaps it’s better as a pre- rather than post-meal dessert), and it is nothing to go crazy over. Shake Shack offers 5 percent of its sales of the Rainbow Connection concrete (vanilla custard, donut pieces, and strawberry and rose jam served with rainbow sprinkles) to LA PRIDE, which devotes itself to advancing LGBT rights.
There are other perks as well. Shake Shack has also secured an alcohol license, so beer and wine will also be found on the menu. For those who are dog-crazy — don’t worry, they sell dog treats too. So while Shake Shack is good — and definitely worth trying — it might be worth waiting until the line dies down.
Shake Shack is opening another location in Glendale later this year, as well as a downtown Los Angeles location in 2017.

The acclaimed, animated Portokalos family has one more colossal celebration to get through in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, set to be released in theaters on March 25. The original romantic comedy, which premiered in 2002, followed the unconventional love story of Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) and Ian Miller (John Corbett) and the clash of their Greek and American cultural traditions. Flash forward more than a decade and the couple is struggling again with their relationship, but with a graduating high school daughter and the upcoming, now-official wedding for Toula’s parents thrown into the mix.
The film focuses on the impending issue of love within three different generations: Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria Portokalos (Lainie Kazan); Toula and Ian; and their granddaughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) and her love interest Bennett (Alex Wolff). As the Greeks put it, there are four different words for love: “agape,” means unconditional love; as with God for man, “philia,” meaning love between friends, “eros,” meaning love between intimate partners, and “storge,” meaning love between parents and their children. This complex notion of love is spun into a comedic fashion in the first film by showing Greeks as lovers of lamb, the Orthodox Church and their heritage, but that is not all that the entire Portokalos family has to offer the second time around.
The prequel received numerous laughs as producers Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks prided themselves on adhering to the romantic comedy genre. In an interview with Variety, Hanks said, “I don’t think [rom-coms] work unless they accurately reflect behavior that people recognize.”
Despite the overarching banter about Greek-American culture, the relationship between Toula and Ian presents strife with eros that carries on to the sequel. The characters worked hard to achieve their happy ending in the first film, which resulted in their daughter Paris growing up in her mother’s footsteps. Now, moviegoers will have the opportunity to experience a similar journey with Paris as they did with Toula, as she continues to grow up immersed in the Greek culture kept alive by her family in the midst of her American surroundings.
Families of different cultures will relate to this seemingly outlandish tale of a foreign clan replenishing their heritage in America, getting the best of both worlds. Executive producer Paul Brooks positively described the audience’s reactions to the Los Angeles Times by saying, “So many families across America were saying, ‘That’s my family.’ The one thing that matters at the end of the day is family.”
In addition to the Greek humor, another overarching theme is storge, the familial love. The bond between the Portokalos elders, their children and now grandchildren remarks the highlight of the film as it teaches viewers how to love one another and how to love outside of one’s community. The romance aspect behind this romantic comedy transcends to a deeper level, includes themes that audiences will appreciate — Portokalos family’s fortitude and pride, not to mention their incredible wit, as the prequel’s jokes about Windex and the dire need for a big fat Greek wedding continue.

Body taboo · The Vagina Monologues started off as a one-woman play by Eve Ensler and became a popular platform for expressing feminist issues. – Photo courtesy of The Vagina Monologues at UCSD
If in the world of emojis, a peach represents a butt and an eggplant represents a penis, which emoji would represent a vagina?  The diamond emoji?
Vagina. What a weird word! Even in this post-feminist world, where women are in charge of their sexuality and girls are taught they’re just as good as boys, saying vagina out loud feels wrong — like I’m swearing in front of my middle school principal.
It feels awkward rolling off my tongue. Six letters, three syllables, va-gy-nah.
Why is it that we hear about erectile dysfunction on TV, but tampon and pad advertisers rarely use the word “period” or “vagina”? It’s almost like having a uterus and a vagina is shameful.
When I was brainstorming names for this column in early January, and I had finally settled on “The Hijabi Monologues,” the associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan said: “Well, I love that you’re playing off of The Vagina Monologues…”
I lost what she said after that because I was thinking about the fact that I had not been playing off of The Vagina Monologues because I hadn’t read it! How could I write a feminist literature column if I’d never read what is widely regarded as one of the defining feminist works of the 1990s?
Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues started out as a one-woman play.
“I was worried about vaginas,” writes Ensler in the introduction to her book. “There’s so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them — like the Bermuda Triangle. No one ever reports back from there.”
After reading The Vagina Monologues, I am worried about vaginas too.
In our patriarchal world, where women are subjected to harassment and rape and even genital mutilation, female sexuality is largely forbidden. Even here in L.A., which claims liberal ideologies and a diverse population, women are still labelled sluts and whores for doing the same as men do.
Ensler’s book is a compilation of interviews she conducted with more than 200 women.
“At first, women were reluctant to talk,” Ensler writes, “They were a little shy. But once they got going, you couldn’t stop them. Women secretly love to talk about their vaginas. They get very excited, mainly because no one’s ever asked them before.”
Ensler asked her subjects questions that ranged from odd to serious, such as, “If your vagina got dressed, what would it wear?” and “If your vagina could talk, what would it say, in two words?”
To the first question, the answers were the expected: a leather jacket, silk stockings, a silk kimono, an electrical shock device to keep unwanted strangers away — and how sad it is, that saying “‘no”’ isn’t enough, that this woman felt the need for a weapon to get her message across — and more.
For the second question, some women answered, “slow down,” “more please” and “not yet.”
What’s fascinating about Ensler’s work is that it’s realistic. Some of the women interviewed laid themselves bare, both literally and figuratively, but they were almost apologetic in their answers. Years of being told that female genitalia are appalling are not so easily forgotten, and Ensler conveys that to the reader without judgment.
The Vagina Monologues talks about the importance of body hair, about childbirth, about rape. It talks of women’s first experiences with pleasure, with boys and periods. I won’t call it comprehensive, because I doubt one book can encompass the relationship between a woman and her vagina, but Ensler’s book gets pretty close to it.
Since its publication  in 1998, The Vagina Monologues has been read and performed countless of times, especially on college campuses, those special environments where you’re almost a child again — anything is possible, everything is new.
How many times did I use the word vagina, both in its plural and singular form, in this article? Microsoft Word tells me I used it 18 times. At least, now saying it out loud is slightly less awkward.

It’s hard to believe that spring break ended less than a week ago. From alternative breaks at Navajo Nation in Utah to brigades all the way in Honduras, many students committed their seven days to humanitarian causes. These experiences bring a slew of benefits, but there’s always the risk of doing more harm than good in terms of sustainability. It’s an issue that’s especially prevalent when it comes to university programs that send pre-health students abroad for one-week trips.
Medical volunteering has recently greatly expanded, with more than 500 medical organizations in the United States and more than 6,000 short-term missions, according to a 2011 Global Health paper. At a glance, it’s not hard to see the benefits of these trips — at least when it comes to the students.
For a week, students experience life beyond the sheltered bubble of college where they can’t enjoy the everyday luxuries of heat, running water, electricity and — God forbid — Wi-Fi. Often located in developing countries, these brigades allow students to foster cultural appreciation and sensitivity, essential qualities in developing empathy. And while most pre-med students haven’t received enough medical training to perform procedures, there’s more than enough to do to run a makeshift health center, from setting up tents to escorting patients.
There’s a downside, however. As a paper published by the journal Globalization and Health put it, the issues regarding “voluntourists” include “using vulnerable people in developing countries to practice clinical skills, enhance resumes, and provide opportunities for travel to far-away and exotic places.”
More often than not, these trips also serve to add another bulletpoint to the resume.
“There is such pressure for students to have these experiences to get into medical or public health schools that short-term programs are springing up all over the place,” Melissa Melby, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Delaware, told NPR. Such a trend is dangerous because it marks a shift of focus. It becomes more about how the trip can help the student make a difference rather than how it can ultimately help others. In fact, according to a recent survey by the AAMC, of 13,682 matriculating medical students in 2015, 36.3 percent participated in international mission trips. This high number could suggest that international missions may be an increasing tacit expectation for admissions.
Another issue is that some students are so eager to serve that they often overstep boundaries. In a 2008 paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics, a medical student who embarked on a mission trip to Mexico recalled, “While I was seeing patients by myself, other first-year medical students were performing surgeries in the other clinics and later bragging about it.” Practicing without a license is prohibited in the United States — why should the standard of care and ethical conduct be any different when we leave our borders?
And then there’s long-term sustainability. While students often help many individuals, the root of the issue remains untouched. Deep-seated problems, from inefficiencies in infrastructure to bureaucratic instability, are difficult to solve, especially for groups operating from outside the country.
While a systemic overhaul is often not within reach, perhaps involving the local community can help ensure sustainability. The approach would be not only on treating patients, but on education and public health as well. After all, if the aid were based entirely on foreign aid, a culture of dependency will inevitably follow. Continuity is crucial to ensure lasting impact is made.
Still, on the bright side, groups that do make sustainability a priority are emerging. For instance, there’s Shoulder to Shoulder, an NGO that has served the rural communities of Honduras for 26 years and employs over 150 local staff members. Dennis Clements, a professor of pediatrics and global health at Duke University, told NPR about a program he designed that educates students in a 12-week training course on not only global health, but also the area’s history, religion and cultural practices before letting them take off.
With more established efforts, one-week trips will be able to support causes that make a lasting impact. In turn, as motivations become more centered on helping communities rather than gaining experience alone, efforts to tend to our own backyard will increase. Amid all this traveling frenzy, we often leave our own communities in the dust, neighborhoods that could use the same help that we’re shuttling off to places abroad. After all, getting out of our comfort zones and helping others doesn’t always require a passport.

Last week, Dawn Hudson, CEO of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, responded to a letter written from George Takei, Ang Lee and 23 other members of the Academy of Asian descent. The letter outlined the offensiveness of the joke with the statement, “It certainly was never the Academy’s intent to offend anyone.” Perhaps not — but, as George Takei said in his interview with The Hollywood Reporter, “[The Academy] had oversight of the whole thing. They knew what was going to be presented.” And when host Chris Rock introduced Asian children wearing suits and carrying briefcases, the stand against racism in the industry faded as another classic racist joke emerged — one that had been drowned out by other, louder issues.
The joke in question happened during the telecast when three small children walked up on stage with confused expressions plastered on their faces, dressed as accountants — because obviously, that’s what Asian American children will grow up to be while those in China go on to make our smartphones. Child labor in China was met with laughter. Stereotypes were deemed racist to one group yet entertaining to another. The Academy’s willingness to throw an ignorantly outrageous and racist joke in the face of the Asian community forces the industry to take a step back, the community to stand up, and society to reflect on the mistakes and sufferings of the past for a move toward a more inclusive future.
As usual, the token Asian — in this case three Asians — was categorized and stereotyped in an attempt to diversify the Oscars, yet the joke didn’t rub anyone the wrong way during the rehearsal. Here’s to the Academy, the entertainment industry, the studios, the directors, the writers, the producers: Making an ethnic group the laughingstock for entertainment merely because of their culture, traditions, appearance or the country’s problems is not acceptable, and it definitely is not funny.
USC is not excluded from a climate rife with the normalcy of the hardworking Asian archetype that speaks volumes to the individual racism that Asian students face. Earlier this month, eggs and racial slurs were thrown at a sophomore and Hong Kong native at Cardinal Gardens apartments. As a University that prides itself in being the forerunner for diversity, the community acts otherwise. We need to stop being stubborn about what we think we know in order to start seeing individuals as individuals instead of groups of minorities. Not just at USC — but all of America.
The Oscars stage, which was meant to be a platform for diversity, has been twisted to become a platform for ignorance. The cold words that have enraged, hurt and belittled the Asian community and Asians around the world shows how far Hollywood and America have to go.
But this issue is bigger than one ethnic population in the United States. It incorporates the minority and the majority, the included and the excluded and the labeled and the stereotyped; it means humanity. It means that the Academy must push racial boundaries because art and talent has nothing to do with race. As director Alejandro Iñárritu put it in his Oscars speech this year, “the color of the skin become as irrelevant as the length of our hair.”
However, this uproar is also an opportunity. An analysis of racial and gender representation published by the Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism found that over half of “cinematic, television, or streaming stories fail to portray one speaking or named Asian or Asian American on screen.”
America has the opportunity to start portraying reality. As the heart of the entertainment industry, Los Angeles should provide roles representing ethnic and even gender minorities as dynamic characters because the real world is not made up only of Asian accountants. The joke, though ill-intentioned, has the potential to open minds, launch serious reflection on part of industry insiders, and mark a fresh start towards diversity.

With some of the richest celebrities in the world — and thousands of people on the streets — Los Angeles is the definition of an economically divided city.
To combat the city’s reputation as the homeless capital of America, L.A. residents such as Elvis Summers recently launched the Tiny House Project, building small houses equipped with locks and solar-powered lights, and donating them to prevent people from sleeping outside.
However, the city has not responded well to the placement of these houses — with sites like 110 Freeway underpasses — and has confiscated them, citing them as health hazards and nuisances to local residents.
Ironically, last month L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti announced his plan to curb homelessness in L.A. by investing $1.85 billion over the next decade and an additional $150 million over the next two years.
Instead of evicting people from the tiny houses, the city of L.A. needs to team up with innovators like Summers and work on building new communities for homeless people. It should work to provide more public-private partnerships to provide immediate care to the homeless.
L.A. should follow in Portland’s footsteps with the nonprofit Dignity Village, which has expanded micro-communities for the chronically homeless on city-owned property for the past 15 years.
The city should initiate efforts to relocate the tiny houses in permitted areas to alleviate tensions with local residents. To address sanitation concerns, the city government should move these homes next to facilities with basic plumbing or bring in portable toilets and washing stations.
Small compartment homes give the homeless an opportunity to find comfort in their own individual safe place. Many homeless shelters are overcrowded, and people come and go without being given proper mental health care or rehabilitation treatment. Evicting people from their tiny homes forces them back on the streets — which is surely not safer than living behind a locked door.
In the past, Garcetti has given hollow promises about helping the homeless. In fact, since Garcetti’s first day in office three years ago, the homeless population has increased by 12 percent. The city already spends approximately $100 million to deal with homeless people, but much of the funds go toward law enforcement to police the population. The city criminalizes the homeless and confiscates what little property they have instead of helping them.
However, homeless people have apparently become a big enough eyesore to cause people to complain to Garcetti to initiate some change in his policies toward the homeless population.
Garcetti’s new agenda includes building and leasing long-term housing for the homeless with direct access to social services. After his top advisor left earlier this week, he also plans to appoint a city homelessness coordinator and create more public restrooms and showers.
However, Garcetti’s agenda points to a questionable allocation of funds. In a city homelessness report, city officials stated funding may be acquired through federal and state grants, fees on real estate transactions and bond or tax hikes. However, there has been no real confirmation of how additional funding will play out for the $2 billion within the next 10 years. Ultimately, the plan will cost a significant amount of money and take extensive time to conduct research and development.
In the meantime, provisional solutions should be made, especially with public-private partnerships, which have more flexible fundraising strategies as with the creation of philanthropic enterprises.
Summers crowdfunded nearly $100,000 in donations to build houses, and with the help of the city in a public-private partnership, a transparent and direct plan of action can be taken to address homelessness in L.A.
