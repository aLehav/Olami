Sad that “Friends” has been taken off Netflix? Here are the new titles coming to your favorite streaming services. 
Netflix
“A Sun”
A Taiwanese film directed by Chung Mong-hong, “A Sun” centers a family dealing with the aftermath of their son’s incarceration. The film allows audiences to deeply connect with the characters as they traverse through strained relationships, and raises questions about the value of forgiveness. The film is dark and emotional, yet wholly poetic and captivating. “A Sun” is an excellent choice for any student interested in exploring the ramifications of incarceration and family development. “A Sun” will be available to stream on Jan. 24. 
“Anne with an E”
Based on the novel “Anne of Green Gables” by Lucy Maud Montgomery, “Anne with an ‘E’” documents the adventures of Anne Shirley-Cuthbert (Amybeth McNulty). Anne, a high-spirited, passionate girl, faces many challenges as a young orphan living in the late 19th century. USC students interested in gender studies and social justice would love this show as it tackles topical issues of prejudice and women’s empowerment while remaining inspiring and uplifting. Netflix and CBC released a joint statement in November 2019 stating that the series has been canceled and will not be renewed for a fourth season. 
Hulu
“Party of Five”
A reboot of the ’90s television series, “Party of Five” focuses on the lives of the Acosta children following their parent’s sudden deportation back to Mexico. The series brought to streaming by the original creators of “Party of Five,” Amy Lippman and Christopher Keyser, showcases the decisions the children have to make for their own survival, which heavily reflects the real-life hardships many immigrant families face today. USC students will be able to connect with the Acosta children’s passions, such as Emilio Acosta’s (Brandon Larracuente) music career and witness the emotional distress that comes with a parent’s sudden departure due to deportation
“Honeyland”
The most-awarded documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in 2019, “Honeyland” is set in a remote village in Macedonia. Students who wish to expand their global perspective will enjoy this film as it follows the life of Hatizde Muratova, a beekeeper who lives with her mother, as she deals with the arrival of a disruptive family that disturbs her way of life. Tensions soon begin to arise, and viewers are pulled into Hatizde’s life through the film’s exhibition of bright, vivid detail. 
HBO
“Midsommar”
For students who are going through a breakup or trying to conduct research for their thesis, “Midsommar” is a perfect film to watch. “Midsommar,” a horror film written and directed by Ari Aster, follows the adventure of couple Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) and their friends to a rural Swedish town for their mid-summer festival. The trip, which was originally intended to be a carefree getaway, quickly descends into madness and gore at the hands of a pagan cult. “Midsommar” proves through flowery imagery and bright colors that a film does not have to be shot in the dark in order to be scary.
“Pain and Glory”
“Pain and Glory,” also known as “Dolor y Gloria,” is a Spanish drama film directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar. Students in the School of Cinematic Arts would be interested in this film as it centers around a film director named Salvador Mallo (Antonio Banderas) as he experiences a series of reencounters. The film explores different memories of Mallo’s, now a man on the verge of physical decline, as he reflects on his life decisions. Chosen by Time magazine as the best film of the year and nominated for several awards, “Pain and Glory” will be available to stream on Jan. 14.

Entry fees became a thing of the past last weekend when the Museum of Contemporary Art celebrated its new policy of free admission with the aptly named “Art for All” festival at its Grand Avenue and Little Tokyo locations. 
Free admission as well as free tours of the galleries will continue at MOCA for the foreseeable future. 
“Today is the first official launch day of MOCA offering free general admission,” MOCA Chief Communications Officer Sarah Stifler said. “It is a day where we are celebrating the museum, the arts community, creativity and our friends and neighbors in Los Angeles.” 
Free admission at MOCA was made possible by a $10 million gift from the MOCA Board of Trustees President Carolyn Powers. Powers’ goal was to remove the financial barriers to entry by doing away with the museum’s previous $15 entry fee. 
“I think when you work in a museum and in an arts organization and you have been doing this for a long time, you realize … that art museums should be more akin to libraries,” Stifler said about Powers’ contribution. “They should be a place that you should come [into] and be inspired, learn something, be challenged and see new things and have new experiences, and you shouldn’t necessarily have to pay for that.” 
“Art for All” featured  myriad  exhibitions, artists and art-making activities. At MOCA Grand Avenue, “Dream City,” a video piece by Los Angeles-based artist Ulysses Jenkins,  played on a loop in the Ahmanson Auditorium as visitors toured the exhibitions above and enjoyed live jazz music outside in MOCA’s Arco Court. 
Jenkins’ work was a disconcerting video collage of music, dance, color and sound that was created in response to Ronald Reagan’s presidency and questioned the current state of American society. According to Stifler, the museum was deliberate in its decision to feature Jenkins’ work at the festival. 
“We were very specific in who we reached out to,” Stifler said. “We were very specific in wanting to reach out to our neighbors and our immediate community.” 
In a similar vein, TAIKOPROJECT, a Los Angeles group of young, emerging Taiko drummers, was invited to perform at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA in Little Tokyo during the festival. Taiko is a centuries-old form of Japanese drumming that involves a range of percussion instruments, some of which weigh up to 100 pounds. 
The deep sound of the TAIKOPROJECT’s drums echoed throughout the festival during the group’s performance. According to TAIKOPROJECT’s Artistic Director Masato Baba, Taiko provided a way for their ancestors to reconnect with their Japanese culture after it was stripped away from them during internment in the 1940s. 
Now, as second-generation Taiko drummers, Baba and his group hope to expand and experiment with the possibilities of the art form. 
“We want to push the boundaries of what Taiko can be in terms of adding rock, hip-hop, jazz influences and even various types of dance,” Baba said. “Taiko is a very wide-open art form and is open for interpretation currently — people in Japan might tell you different — but here we’re just trying to do what speaks to us [and] at the same time remember where it came from as well.” 
In addition to TAIKOPROJECT, the Geffen also hosted several art-making activities. At Art’s Barrio Mobile Art Studio, artists Barrio Mobile Art Studio, artists from Self Help Graphics & Art, an East L.A. community arts center, assisted families and other attendees in stencil silkscreen workshops. Other workshops at the Geffen allowed children to create their own mini sculptures. 
Traditional exhibitions were on display as usual at MOCA Grand Avenue, where visitors observed and listened to tour guides discuss a swath of diverse works ranging from the Color Field paintings of Mark Rothko to the more unfamiliar works of Valerie Jaudon. 
Despite the fanfare and generally positive attention the event received, not everyone in attendance was convinced that MOCA’s vision of a diversified audience would pan out. 
Barry Canty, an Angeleno and  frequent MOCA visitor, was not sure that admission prices were the reason people from lower income backgrounds were not attending. 
“I think consumption of art in general is not necessarily connected to one’s ability to afford it,” Canty said. “I think there are certain behaviors that are associated with particular lifestyles, and I think if people come from lower income backgrounds, very often they don’t see art consumption as something they have time to do — it’s more of a luxury.”
Cindy Rozas, who attended MOCA once or twice before, said she was hopeful about MOCA’s efforts to include diverse museumgoers but recognized that there is room for improvement. 
“I think [the museum’s admissions efforts] will help because it will make it accessible to everyone and people won’t have the barrier of entry [of] having to pay,” Rozas said. “But I think there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that the communities that don’t come here have access to come and that they are welcomed and that they feel that this is art for them as well.”

“Do you promise me from now on in the show you’re gonna give me everything you possibly have?” 
With a simple question, the 6,300 seat Shrine Auditorium erupted into an ear-shattering roar Saturday. L.A. was the second stop on the Rex Orange County’s (Alexander O’Connor) “Pony Tour” to promote his album of the same name. A diverse audience with members ranging from groups of teens celebrating a birthday to a middle-aged couple belting out lyrics with perfect accuracy hung onto every word the 21-year-old indie-pop artist said. 
The opening stage design was a background of clouds illuminated by magical pink and yellow lights, creating a surreal and imaginary setting that matched the opening ballads. Partway through the set, a curtain dropped behind Rex, isolating him from the rest of the band and forcing Rex toward the front of the stage. Closer to the audiences, Rex turned the high-budget national tour into a concert that felt as intimate as a backyard show. 
Rex continued to prove his musical ability beyond singing, as he accompanied himself on the Wurlitzer piano and electric guitar. A few songs later, the curtain abruptly fell to the ground, revealing an entirely new stage design complete with a wall of flashing lights and a towering “Pony” logo with an illuminated silhouette. This new electric stage matched the shift in songs, as Rex played his earlier, more upbeat electronic hits.
“It was a very well designed show, not just with his good performance but with stage design, lights, sounds,” said Nathan Hirsch, a freshman at USC who attended Saturday night’s performance. “ I think naturally L.A. will change anything given where it is and the environment because given that we’re in the center of entertainment for both music, cinema, TV, I think even stage performances in general, is that there is an expectation to make it super big and bombastic, and I think he definitely did that.”
The highlight of the show came early on: As the first note of “Pluto Projector” rang through the venue, fans started cheering and hugging one another in a moment of solidarity representative of the song’s profound impact on all Rex Orange County fans. As the fan-favorite string section reached its height, an audience member nearby was brought to tears. 
In a unique request, Rex paused in the middle of one of his biggest hits, “Best Friend,” and asked the audience to stop recording, put away their phones and be in the moment. Audience members complied and experienced the rest of the song with a feeling of unity. They jumped in synchronization, held up hearts and enjoyed an unobstructed view of the stage free of phones.
The set-list was a perfectly balanced mix of songs from his new album, “Pony,” and older hits that were the foundation for his fame. Since this was the beginning of the tour, the newer songs were more performative, with Rex bouncing around the stage with dorky, uncoordinated dance moves that charmed audiences. His older hits took a different route, performed with simpler instrumentation, frequently just a piano and sometimes a saxophone accompaniment. This pared-down style allowed audiences, full of emotion, to belt out the lyrics without being distracted by fancy performances. 
With a declaration that he was going to play the last song of the night, Rex gave a heartfelt performance of “It’s Not the Same Anymore” and the audience sang along with everything they had left. Even after the confetti fell and the band left the stage, the audience broke into chants of “encore” and “Alex.” The unified plea was successful, and the band returned to play “Always.” 
Concertgoers left with hoarse voices, the result of singing along to the setlist for an hour and a half straight. Because of this sustained crowd inclusion, the concert was elevated to an experience that engaged everyone in the venue and left the artist declaring his thanks for the energy and commitment of all who attended.

I’ve often heard “Little Women” is a book for those without siblings. As an only child who devoured the story alone in my room, the clamor of the March girls surging up to fill the silence around me, I immediately felt seen. It is not, perhaps, a theory that holds up under intense scrutiny — I’m sure there are plenty of people with siblings who adored the book and plenty more only children who recoiled from its depiction of sisterhood — but it rings true for me. So I was quite excited when it was announced that Greta Gerwig, of “Lady Bird” fame, was working on a “Little Women” remake, bringing a fresh perspective to a story that’s over a century old and has seen innumerable stage and screen adaptations. 
The schtick that this version employs to distinguish itself is a nonlinear chronology, where the timeline bounces back and forth between childhood and adulthood. Scenes from younger, more carefree times — Meg at the debutante ball, Amy burning Jo’s manuscript, Beth playing Mr. Laurence’s piano — cut sharply to the somber reality of the present day: Amy in Paris studying to become an artist, Jo in New York desperately trying to sell her short stories, Meg at home coveting beautiful things while married to a penniless tutor. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Gerwig explained that she shot the childhood scenes using a filter that gave them a warm golden glow, which throws the drab grayness that pervades the scenes from adulthood into even starker relief. 
Some transitions between the two can be jarring, and some cheesy, but overall the juxtaposition works terrifically well. It’s especially effective in contrasting the two times Beth is stricken with scarlet fever. Both times, Jo sits vigil at her bedside through the night. Both times, she awakens to an empty bed. The first time, she thunders downstairs in a panic and finds Marmee and Beth sitting at the kitchen table, her fever broken. The second time, she finds only Marmee. Sure, it’s manipulative as hell, but the movie knows that and you know that, and you still cry buckets anyway. 
Which reminds me, FYI: It’s impossible to watch “Little Women” without getting at least a tad misty-eyed. By the end, I was full-on sobbing. Part of that is due to the brilliant work of the actors, all of whom are perfectly cast: Emma Watson as big sister Meg, with her sweet, docile doe eyes, the beauty of the March family; Saoirse Ronan as main character Jo, with her loping gait and twitchy ink-stained fingers; Eliza Scanlen as angelic Beth, her perpetually rosy cheeks a foreboding omen of her fate; Florence Pugh as Amy, who transforms from an impetuous and cosseted child to a woman of clear-eyed practicality; and, of course, Timothée Chalamet as Laurie, louche and languid, with a habit of draping himself across furniture like a Dali clock. “Little Women” ensures that each member of the all-star cast gets a moment to shine. 
But part of the reason that “Little Women” tugged so insistently on my heartstrings is because it is a movie about nostalgia. Forget the golden filter; Gerwig might as well have shot the movie through rose-tinted glasses. “Little Women” paints a romanticized portrait of family life that’s utterly irresistible and utterly fictitious. The March sisters put on plays and go ice-skating and wear flower crowns and walk arm-in-arm; they are the picture-perfect models of joyful, feckless childhood. Together, they are a flurry of activity, radiating love and light and warmth and laughter. 
We, the audience, are not invited into their coterie. Like Laurie, we are outsiders looking in, drawn like a moth to a flame to their happy haven. Perhaps only children feel this sensation the most keenly; I know I did. 
In a scene between Jo and Meg right before Meg’s wedding, Jo beseeches her sister to run away with her. Meg gently turns her down. Defeated, Jo sighs, “I can’t believe childhood is over.” 
In a few months, I will graduate from college. Like Jo, I want to move to New York to be a writer. Two of my friends are getting married. I have well and truly entered full-blown adulthood and all the terrifying prospects that accompany it. “Little Women” expertly zeroed in on all my softest, most sensitive parts, all my tender vulnerabilities, and prodded at them until I was a bruised and bloodied mess. It’s a lovely, lovely movie, and I highly recommend seeing it.

The No. 3 USC men’s tennis team participated in the Oracle Pro Series Tournament held on their home courts at the Marks Stadium Monday through Sunday. 
Unlike previous competitions, which have solely consisted of college players, this tournament also included professionals ranked in the Association of Tennis Professionals standings. The challenge of competing against highly skilled opponents  troubled some of the Trojans, but the team still found general success in both singles and doubles play despite the tough competition.
Notable USC players in the main draw included junior Daniel Cukierman, senior Riley Smith, senior Brandon Holt, freshman Ryder Jackson (singles only) and sophomore Bradley Frye (doubles only). 
Many Trojans were eliminated in the earlier rounds of singles play, but Holt was able to reach the semifinals before falling to No. 368 Alexander Ritschard, who previously played for Virginia during its 2016-17 National Championship campaign.
Despite Holt’s impressive run, head coach Brett Masi still thinks the senior can do better.
“[Holt] did compete really well,” Masi said. “He didn’t play his best level of tennis that he is capable of, but he played at a very … high level. A lot of them are top 500 in the world or better, and it shows that Brandon is fully capable of playing with these guys.”
In doubles, Holt, Cukierman and Smith reached the finals, with the pair of Cukierman and Smith winning it all. Holt was paired with Swiss player Sandro Ehrat, ranked No. 582 in doubles play.
Cukierman and Smith faced some difficult opponents in their journey to the finals, including French duo Geoffrey Blancaneaux and Florian Lakat, who are ranked in the top 300 in the world for doubles. Masi was particularly proud of Cukierman and Smith’s doubles performance. 
“[Cukierman and Smith] beat four teams that were very highly ranked guys, and I think that was super impressive on their part to come in and do it,” Masi said after the pair’s tightly contested finals victory over Holt and Ehrat.
According to Masi, the tournament was a good experience for the Trojans looking to compete professionally in the future. 
“A lot of the things that this tournament was about was to help these guys learn what the process is in order to be and play at that next level and get them that exposure,” Masi said. “Now, they need to take those next steps in their own games personally to [get to the next level].”
The Trojans hope to build on their success as they face other elite schools at the Sherwood Collegiate Classic this week in Thousand Oaks.

After the USC football team finished the regular season 8-4, prospects for the program modestly appeared to be improving. The team won five out of its last six contests and only narrowly missed out on a spot in the Pac-12 Championship, and USC earned an appearance against the No. 16 Iowa Hawkeyes in the Holiday Bowl. 
Unfortunately for the Trojans, the second half success didn’t tell the full story of a defense that finished 78th in the nation. The good times quickly came to an abrupt end for Helton and company during a 49-24 loss to the Hawkeyes, and defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast was fired the next day. With frustration at University Park building and the defensive coordinator position in flux, here are some of the candidates most likely to replace Pendergast in the upcoming season. 
Joe Barry 
Barry served as the linebackers coach and associate head coach of the Los Angeles Rams for the past three years. Before coaching the Rams, Barry was the defensive coordinator for the Washington Redskins from 2015 to 2016. He played linebacker at USC during the 1990s before entering the coaching field. 
After the Rams parted ways with former defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, Barry’s name emerged as a possible candidate to take over that same position with the Rams. However, with the Rams’ Friday hiring of Brandon Staley, Barry is now out of the mix for that position, increasing the chance that he’ll end up on Helton’s staff. As of now, Barry is considered one of the frontrunners for the job at USC, and has already interviewed for it, according to NBC Sports. 
Kris Richard 
Like Barry, Richard is also a USC alum. The current Dallas Cowboys defensive backs coach played cornerback for the Trojans from 1998 to 2001 and played seven seasons in the NFL before returning to USC in 2008 as a graduate assistant coach under head coach Pete Carroll. Afterward, Richard followed Carroll to the Seattle Seahawks, where he coached for eight seasons—including three as defensive coordinator and developed one of the most dominant secondaries in football’s history — the Legion of Boom. 
Richard would be a fitting hire for USC. He’s a Southern California native who could provide a necessary boost to a team that has declined dramatically in recruiting rankings in recent seasons, and his renowned intensity could bring about a culture change for a program in urgent need of one. 
Richard’s name is  floating around as a top candidate for numerous defensive coordinator opportunities in the NFL, but given his connections to the cardinal and gold, he can’t be counted out as Pendergast’s eventual replacement.
Ryan Nielsen
Unsurprisingly, another former Trojan has been rumored as a candidate to rejoin USC next season. Nielsen played defensive end for four years at USC before joining the Trojans’ coaching staff in 2002. His most recent college coaching stint came as defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator at North Carolina State from 2013 to 2016, where he developed a front four that all got drafted and included first-rounder Bradley Chubb. 
After his tenure at NC State, Nielsen was hired as the New Orleans Saints defensive line coach in 2017. In three seasons, Nielsen improved the Saints’ defensive line from a unit that was No. 27 in sacks and No. 19 in run defense before his arrival to a front that now ranks No. 3 in sacks and No. 5 in run defense. 
Given this demonstrated ability to develop talent at the highest level, Nielsen is one of the hottest candidates rumored to be in the running for USC’s defensive vacancy.
Zach Arnett 
Coming in as the first candidate on the list without a degree from USC, Arnett is the current defensive coordinator for the San Diego State Aztecs.
Like Arnett’s coaching candidacy, San Diego State’s defensive prowess has flown under the radar in recent seasons. Last season, Arnett’s Aztecs ranked No. 4 in the nation in points allowed per game, No. 2 in rushing yards allowed per game and No. 4 in passes intercepted — all numbers that ranked far better than USC. 
Arnett ran a 3-3-5 defensive scheme similar to what Pendergast ran in recent seasons. Considering his success at SDSU and what would likely be a reduced learning curve for USC’s defense, Arnett could at least be given an interview. 
Charlie Strong
Ironically, the only coach on this list who is a household name among college football fans is also the coach who appears to be getting the least buzz regarding USC’s open position.
If hired, Strong would arrive at University Park with 10 years of head coaching experience and a championship defensive pedigree, having served as co-defensive coordinator and defensive coordinator for Urban Meyer’s National Championship teams at Florida in 2006 and 2008, respectively. 
Strong hasn’t enjoyed the same success as a head coach. Over the course of three seasons at Texas, he went 16-21 before being fired and taking the same job at USF, where he went 21-16 after three seasons and was fired last month. Still, Strong’s background alone would make him an attention-grabbing offseason hire and could have a strong impact in turning USC’s defensive struggles around.

The USC women’s basketball team dropped two games in a row over the weekend, falling to Colorado 66-53 in Boulder, Friday and suffering a close 67-65 loss against Utah in Salt Lake City Sunday. 
The first half of the Colorado game proved promising for a young USC team. The Trojans played tight defense, allowing only 7 points in the second quarter while maintaining a 5-point lead going into the third quarter. 
However, the Trojans’ transition defense broke down after the half, allowing the Buffs to take over by scoring a dizzying 27 points in the third quarter. USC shot 18.8% from the field in the fourth quarter, and head coach Mark Trakh’s team could not recover from Colorado’s offensive onslaught. 
Freshman center Angel Jackson led the Trojans with 12 points while senior forward Kayla Overbeck stood out with seven rebounds. 
Overbeck was the only forward to hit double digits in points and make a significant impact around the glass. Jackson and freshman forward Alissa Pili grabbed fewer than five rebounds each. Overall, the Trojans lost the rebound battle 50-31. 
“I think that it’s important to execute for 40 minutes,” Trakh said. “I think we are getting there. I think the injuries have killed us … but we got to keep on improving and keep on getting better.”
Two days after playing Utah, 3-pointers finally started to fall for the Trojans in what soon became a fast paced game. 
After a tight 2-point game for much of the third and fourth quarters, USC secured a 5-point edge with less than five minutes in the game. But Utah sophomore  guard Dry Gylten and senior wing Daneesha Provo drained two key threes down the stretch to eventually give Utah a late lead.
With less than 10 seconds left in the game, Trakh called a timeout after the teams had traded free throws to bring it to a two-point game.
“Playing with so many young players, [it] can get frantic in a game that’s that close,” Overbeck said about Trakh’s decision to use the timeout. “He was, in a way, trying to calm us down but also giving us that confidence to say, ‘We believe in you, all four of us coaches believe in you, this whole team believes in you, everyone does … Go show us what you can do.’”
Unfortunately for USC, the final play resulted in a missed jumper by sophomore guard Desiree Caldwell. Utah secured the defensive rebound as time wound down. 
Caldwell and freshman guard Endyia Rogers shot above 50% from the field. Caldwell went on to finish the game with 14 points while Pili finished with a team high of 16. The Trojans struggled down low, making only 10 of their 24 layup attempts. 
The two losses dropped the Trojans’ record to 8-8 overall and 0-5 in conference play. USC has yet to see a win this January, with earlier home losses against No. 18 Arizona State and No. 21 Arizona. USC will host UCLA at Galen Center Friday for a second matchup against UCLA, the No. 7 ranked team in the nation.

In the shortest road trip that USC will take all season, the Trojans’ men’s basketball team traveled to Westwood to take on the UCLA Bruins Saturday. 
UCLA has historically had the upper hand over USC, entering the game with a 143-110 all-time advantage, but on Saturday, the Trojans did not let history repeat itself.
After coming off their worst loss of the season against the Washington Huskies last Sunday, the Trojans regained some bragging rights in Westwood, defeating the Bruins 74-63.
Head coach Andy Enfield and the Trojans played a complete game in the winning effort. USC led UCLA in almost every statistical category of the game. The Trojans held the Bruins to a 37.9% shooting percentage and won the rebounding battle 35-31. 
“I thought our players really moved the ball well, they took great shots,” Enfield said. “I thought we tried to take care of the ball as best as we could, their press bothered us a little bit but it also gave us transition opportunities throughout the game.”
USC was happy to be back in Los Angeles after spending nearly an entire week in the Pacific Northwest, where it started conference play 1-1 against WSU and UW. After shooting a measly 20% against Washington, USC knew it needed to improve. 
UCLA entered the game with an 8-7 overall record after losing three of its last four games. The slump left the Bruins tied with the Trojans with matching 1-1 conference records. 
It took time for the Trojans to gain momentum, but after a back and forth first half affair that ended with the Trojans up by 2, USC ran away with the lead in the second half. The Trojans came out of halftime on fire, making six of their first seven shots, and shot 70% from the field while pulling down 18 rebounds over the last 20 minutes of the game. 
USC finished the game shooting more than 57%, a major improvement after recording its worst shooting percentage of the season against UW at a dismal 20%. Four of USC’s starters finished with at least 10 points, a good sign for Enfield’s team after just one player — freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu — barely reached that mark Sunday. 
Freshman guard Ethan Anderson led the Trojans with 12 points on 6-of-9 shooting while junior guard Chris Smith led the Bruins with 16 points and seven rebounds.
Senior forward Nick Rakocevic offered a standout performance with a game-high 17 points and grabbed 14 rebounds while also adding three blocks. 
“Nick played like an all-conference big man tonight … He was so solid defensively,” Enfield said. “He just played great basketball … [I’m] very, very proud of Nick.”
USC is now 13-3 on the season and 2-1 in conference play. The Trojans have already doubled their road wins from last season, when they only won two true road games. For a program that has not won the Pac-12 regular season championship since 1985, the results offer some encouragement.
“We’re 13-3 right now. We won four true road games,” Enfield said. “So this is a big win to cap this off because we get to go home next week.”
USC returns home to Galen Center this Thursday to take on the Cal Bears at 7:30 p.m.
