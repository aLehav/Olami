For many graduate students, the move by Columbia University teaching and research assistants to form a union served as a springboard for a union movement at USC. Students began their involvement with USC Forward, a coalition of students, faculty, alumni and community organizers fighting for a union that will represent USC graduate students.
The mobilization comes off the heels of the August 2016 ruling by the National Labor Relations Board, which decided that graduate students who work as teaching and research assistants at private universities have the right to unionize. The case, spurred by a petition filed by Columbia students who looked to join the United Automobile Workers, reversed a 2004 ruling by the NLRB involving graduate students at Brown University. This older ruling maintained that graduate assistants could not be considered employees because they are first and foremost students, with educational, not economic, ties to their university.

Following the NLRB ruling, graduate students at Columbia chose to unionize in December 2016. According to the United Automobile Workers, which will now represent Columbia graduate students, the vote to unionize was 1,602 to 623.
When USC graduate student Victor Sanchez heard about the Columbia decision, he began organizing with other graduate students who were previously unsure if they even had the right to unionize at a private university.
“The UC system has organized graduate students,” said Sanchez, a research assistant at the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity. “There are things like tuition remission, subsidized child care — all these things that exist. It didn’t become clear until the Columbia decision that we even had that right here at a private university [to unionize].”
Karlynne Ejercito, a graduate student studying American studies and ethnicity who will begin working as a teaching assistant in that department during the next academic year, also emphasized that the desire for a union stems from the fact that many graduate students are married and have started families, and therefore need a body to fight for their access to child care as well as fair wages and racial justice.
“Some of us want to start families,” Ejercito said. “A union is more of a self-determining body that can advocate on behalf of graduate students in terms of pay, child care, in terms of making sure there’s an anti-racist caucus built into the system.”
May Lin, a graduate student studying sociology and public policy, served as a teaching assistant for three semesters in the sociology department before joining PERE as a research assistant. She highlighted the importance of a union as a collective body advocating for just pay, health care and good working conditions.
“A union is a really important way to secure things like healthcare and wages,” Lin said. “Without a union, it’s hard for us to secure the strongest working conditions that we could have. Unionism is a really important vehicle for our well-being and for the University as a whole because we are contributing vital work to the University.”
On March 1, USC Forward hosted a campus resistance event in order to protest the Trump administration’s rhetoric  regarding immigrants and call on President C.L. Max Nikias to declare USC a sanctuary campus. According to Sanchez, these protests stem from the fact that the group, in addition to fighting for a union, also needs to respond to other political events happening nationwide that affect students.
“We’re very much grounded in social justice unionism. What [this] means is that we’re not just fighting for a union solely through the lens of workplace bargaining,” Sanchez said. “A union movement has to also have values that are grounded in real social justice needs and part of that is [addressing] the times. You can’t ignore that we have an administration whose rhetoric is vile and discriminatory and bigoted.”
Robert Chala, a graduate student studying sociology and working as a research assistant with Sanchez and Lin at PERE, highlighted that USC Forward, in addition to calling for a graduate student union, is also focused on issues such as diversity at USC.
“One really strong issue that has come up a lot is diversity,” Chala said. “There’s been a lot of movement around creating a more diverse campus, reaching more students of color and creating a supportive environment for them. The University has made a lot of promises around that, but there’s really no accountability to any of those promises and so that’s one of the major benefits of having a union — being able to hold the University accountable to the promises that they’ve made.”
Ultimately, with support from the Service Employees International Union, USC Forward hopes to expand, joining non-tenure track faculty to combat the recent cost-cutting trends in higher education.
“Many of us are headed to non-tenure track faculty jobs,” Chala said. “Those are realistic changes that are happening in the higher education market, so we need to be able to protect ourselves for the future and the present. The present is graduate students building with non-tenure track faculty and putting a halt to the trends in higher education that are treating graduate students and faculty as cheap labor.”

Few professors who enter USC, aiming to expand their academic achievements and help pass on their knowledge to students, ever expect to feel fear in their classrooms and offices. But for faculty members like Martin Krieger, a professor at the Price School of Public Policy, reports of violence — like the shooting at UCLA last summer in which a student killed an engineering professor — are not that unusual.
“Over the years, every once in a while you hear about a graduate student murdering a faculty member — not often, maybe once every few years,” Krieger said. “Professors are semi-public figures, and there are problems sometimes.”
Since the death of psychology professor Bosco Tjan on campus in December, the USC community has been working to come to terms with the loss of one of its own. But despite vigils, memorial services and memos sent from the administration, one group at USC is continuing to struggle with lasting questions around safety and security — faculty, including professors who say they feel unsafe at work.
David Jonathan Brown, a graduate neuroscience student who worked in Tjan’s lab, is accused of fatally stabbing the professor in his office in the Seeley G. Mudd Building. Brown has pled not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and is currently awaiting trial.
“I’ve heard about [Tjan’s death], but very little information was given out,“ Krieger said. “We have no idea why the student did this, and it was sort of buried in a very funny way.”
Leigh Tost, an assistant professor in the management and organization department of the Marshall School of Business, said that professors have been aware of faculty security for some time, and that Tjan’s death was perhaps more of a reminder than a wake-up call.
“There have been so many tragedies like this across the country in recent years that many professors were worried about their safety already,” Tost said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It’s sad to say, but any time I teach, I identify exit doors.”
Krieger said that the best thing professors can do to prevent violence on campus is to suggest students get the counseling and mental health support they need.
“If you have a student who’s really in trouble, you need to get them help,” Krieger said.
Some USC faculty expressed thoughts of fear, calling for increased vigilance and safety procedures that might prevent incidents like this from occurring in the future. One professor from Marshall, who asked to stay anonymous, said that the University should consider installing security systems, such as metal detectors, in academic buildings.
“The school should make it more secure for everyone,” she said. “When you enter a building in a company, you can’t just enter any way you want, you have to go through a security system. Why don’t schools have protocols like this?”
The Department of Public Safety could not be reached for comment. The professor also noted that USC does take steps to ensure professors can recognize students who may be more likely to feel depressed or act out by providing information on identifying students who could be depressed and stressed.
“I’m also paying attention to any students who appear depressed — maybe I’ll take the initiative to call and ask them how they are feeling and suggest the counseling center,” she said. “Sometimes they can be shy about using it, so I can encourage that they get the professional help they need.”
The professor also said that mandatory training for students and professors alike should be put in place to help them identify who may be feeling severely depressed or stressed. She said that since the school already mandates alcohol awareness training, this could be a valuable supplement to make sure mental health and professor safety are priorities.
“I think that the school should implement training for everyone, not just professors, to help us all identify who is likely to feel stressed or depressed so we can help them,” she said.

The Undergraduate Student Government is officially supporting Los Angeles’ bid to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2024.
Los Angeles has hosted the games twice before, and if its bid is successful, it would be the first American city to host an Olympic Games since the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.
“Obviously, USC is a major stakeholder because the media is going to be housed at USC,” USG President Edwin Saucedo said. “We’ve seen the positive impact that the Games have had in the past on our campus, [and] we wanted to show our support for the Games, not only as schools but as students. The Games can have a really positive impact on the next generation of students.”
Saucedo said that he was initially contacted by LA 2024, the city’s official Exploratory Committee working to bring the Games to Los Angeles. This ultimately resulted in a USG Senate resolution supported by all 11 USG Senators in February. Saucedo also referred the commission to members of UCLA’s student government, which also passed its own resolution in support of the Games.
The commission hopes that Los Angeles’ unique ability to communicate and connect with young people through media-friendly industries in places such as Hollywood and Silicon Beach will aid its competitiveness in securing the games.
“At a time when the Olympic Movement is working hard to engage with young adults around the world, LA 2024 helps pave the way,” said LA 2024 Chairman Casey Wasserman, in a statement in response to the USC and UCLA resolutions. “I’d like to thank UCLA and USC students for their support and enthusiasm for our bid and for their belief in the power of the Games to make our city and the world a better place. Los Angeles’ youth is ready to be inspired by the greatest celebration of sport on the planet — the Olympic and Paralympic Games — and we at LA 2024 are eager to make their dreams come true.”
Though USC’s crosstown rival has its own storied history with the Olympics with 288 medals to date, USC remains the university with the highest number of Olympic wins, notching 309 Summer Olympics medals alone. USC has also won a gold medal at every Summer Olympics since 1912. USC athletes, including six-time Olympic track and field champion Allyson Felix and two-time medalist and beach volleyball player April Ross, are on the LA 2024 Athletes’ Advisory Commission.
The USC resolution cited Los Angeles’ past success with hosting the 1984 Olympic Games, the proceeds from which supported the United States Olympic Committee and the LA84 Foundation, which funds local youth sports organizations in the city. The resolution also noted that should Los Angeles be selected, a number of USC facilities would be utilized. Current plans have the USC Village serving as the media village, the Annenberg building serving as the main press center , additional facilities, such as Dedeaux Field also marked as potential Olympic sites.
Saucedo said that while some senators were concerned about potential student impact, the fact that the Games would be hosted during the summer mitigates problems with negative effects on the student body arising from the Games.
“There were a couple questions about how the Games might impact students’ lives, but  [they] happen during the summer so we don’t think it should be a big impact,” Saucedo said. “We do want to work with LA 2024, if the bid is successful, to ensure that students’ voices be represented at the table at all times. As the Games come closer and decisions are being made and things are being permanently decided on, we want to ensure that their voices are being heard through this working relationship with the organizing committee.”
The International Olympic Committee will meet to decide the host of the 2024 Games in September 2017. Though Budapest was originally a third candidate city, it has since dropped out of the running, and only Paris remains as Los Angeles’ competitor.
“I think it could be really good for Los Angeles, but also I feel like Los Angeles is also very established as a world-renowned city,” said USG Chief of Staff Jenny Di. “I don’t think it’s one of those things where it’s like ‘Oh, this will put is on the map.’ We’re already very much on the map. It would be beneficial, but between Los Angeles and Paris, those are two cities that everyone across the world already knows.”

USC will grant six honorary degrees at the 2017 commencement ceremony on May 12 for civic, academic, scientific and artistic contributions, according to USC News.
The recipients are actor and comedian Will Ferrell, social work leader Suzanne Dworak-Peck, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center founding director David Ho, biomedical innovator Gary Michelson, actress Helen Mirren and Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chairman Mark Ridley-Thomas. Ferrell will also be the commencement ceremony speaker.
Along with the honorary degrees, approximately 15,000 degrees will be commended this year, including 1,500 doctorate degrees.
Ferrell will be honored for his philanthropic contributions to campus initiatives such as USC’s annual Swim With Mike fundraiser, which supports athletes with physical disabilities, and Cancer for College, which confers college scholarships to cancer survivors.
Dworak-Peck was named a Social Work Pioneer by the National Association of Social Workers. After conferring $60 million to name and endowing the USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, she has since served as the chair of the School of Social Work’s Board of Councilors.
Ho has received the Presidential Citizens Medal and 13 honorary doctorates, and in 1996 was recognized as TIME magazine’s “Man of the Year” for pioneering AIDS research.
Michelson is known for spinal surgery techniques improving the safety, effectiveness and expense of traditional spinal surgery approaches. Michelson and his wife, Alya, have teamed with USC to start the Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience, which aims to conduct research accelerating the development of scientific and medical innovation.
Mirren is the only actress to have ever played both Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II on camera and has received numerous Emmy Awards, BAFTA Awards and Golden Globes for her portrayal of dramatic, multidimensional characters.
Ridley-Thomas earned his Ph.D. from USC in 1989, and has since worked to better civic engagement in local communities, improve access to high-quality health care and provide critical services to the homeless. Ridley-Thomas currently serves as chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and is on the board of L.A. Care and is on the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Last weekend, the baseball team played its first Pac-12 series of the season, taking two of three games against Washington State at Dedeaux Field.
The Trojans started off the homestand with a major bang, as they defeated the Cougars 12-3 off of 15 hits in the Friday opener. Five different players in the lineup recorded multiple hits, while senior Corey Dempster led the way with three RBIs on his birthday.
“I was just trying to be more patient in the box,” Dempster said. “I decided to let the ball get to me and then be aggressive early and then with two strikes, really bear down and try to stop chasing pitches.”
Washington State led 1-0 on an RBI double in the second inning, however the advantage would not last long. In the bottom of the third with the bases loaded, Dempster launched a double to right field sending all baserunners home. After that game-changing swing, the Trojans’ offense was a runaway train. They would go on to score seven runs in the next two innings.
“[The pitcher] was coming at me with fastballs, and I was fouling them off,” Dempster said on his big hit. “I was just under them and I was trying to think of an adjustment, trying to get more on top. He threw another fastball away, and I just went with it. I was trying to get the ball deep and I did.”
USC carried over its momentum from an explosive Friday game into Saturday. This time, the hitting proved the difference once again as the lineup produced 11 hits en route to a 4-2 victory. Freshman catcher Blake Sabol recorded his first career highlight play with a two-run stand-up double in the second inning. In the bottom of the third, Dempster continued his hot streak with an RBI single to extend the lead to 3-0. He went 3-of-4 on the game with one run.
Pitching was also a strong suit for USC on Saturday. Junior Brad Wegman got the start after uneven performances in his previous four outings. This time Wegman was strong on the mound, giving up just one run in six innings with five strikeouts. His record improved to 2-2 on the season with a 5.06 ERA.
In the third and final game of the series on Sunday, the Trojans were unable to replicate their previous performances from the plate. Washington State pitcher Cody Anderson was excellent from the mound, throwing eight innings and striking out six batters.
After the Cougars left the first inning with a 1-0 lead, senior Cris Perez tied the game up with a
third-inning solo home run that was launched to left field. Washington State would respond with a run in the fifth to reclaim the lead. In the seventh inning, the game was broken open with a Cougar home run and sacrifice fly that extended the away team’s lead to 4-1. Pitchers Marrick Crouse and Solomon Bates gave up two runs apiece.
After going 2-1 against Washington State, the Trojans are 12-7 on the year. Next, they face UC Irvine on the road this Tuesday before returning home for a series with conference foe Arizona State.

Wow, what a run for the Trojans. Are we sure that that was only a five-day stint for the Trojans in March Madness? It felt like a season’s worth of buzz surrounding USC basketball was tightly compressed into less than a week’s worth of time.
If any team was going to bust my bracket this March, I’ve got to say I’m glad it was the Trojans who did it. I was 21-for-21 with my bracket predictions to open up the first round of the tourney when No. 11 USC topped No. 6 SMU in dramatic fashion last Friday — breaking my bracket in the process. Moral of the story: Never pick against your family, especially the Trojan Family.
Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
And while USC’s glorious tournament run may be over, there’s no doubt that what the Trojans accomplished in the matter of a five-day span has the potential to send ripple effects into next season. For a university that bears “fight on” as its battle cry, it was very appropriate for the Trojans to pick up their pair of tournament wins last week in come-from-behind fashion.
USC overcame a 17-point deficit to defeat Providence in its First Four contest, and it powered back from a 10-point deficit against SMU to top the Mustangs in the first round of the NCAA Tournament just four days ago. And as its students floated on boats in Baja California and Cabo San Lucas for spring break, USC was floating atop the college basketball world for several hours last week after pulling off its dramatic 66-65 upset of SMU.
In their three NCAA Tournament games (played in Dayton, Ohio and Tulsa, Okla. over the span of five days), USC exhibited that it was the master of the comeback victory in college basketball this season. The Trojans’ comeback wins against Providence and SMU put USC at a national-best 13 wins when trailing by double-digits at some point in a game. At times during the regular season and even into the postseason, it felt like USC relished falling behind in games; it was like the Trojans “had them right where they wanted ’em” when their opponents took a lead into the half.
While the Trojans did not quite overcome their deficit in Sunday’s 82-78 season-ending loss to Baylor, it felt like USC was playing dead again in hopes of a second-half surge to victory.
Following Sunday’s game, Baylor coach Scott Drew said, “I actually joked with [USC head coach] Andy [Enfield]. I said, `You want to be up at halftime?’ and he said, `No, I want to be down.’”
But now it’s on to the offseason for USC, and the hype train for the 2017-18 college basketball season is already prematurely booming.
Coming off of a program-best 26 wins this season, USC will face higher-than-ever expectations in the coming winter. USC finished a modest fifth in the Pac-12 standings this season, but it showed an ability to compete with top-tier programs in the nation (think UCLA, Oregon and Arizona). And if the team is able to maintain its comeback ability into the coming season, nothing is out of the grasp of Enfield’s team in 2018.
But where the Trojans find their biggest upside for the future is in their youth. USC had no senior starters on its roster this season.
It’s no secret that the biggest task on Andy Enfield’s to-do list for this offseason will be retaining standout sophomore forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu. If both of these players return for their junior season, one could easily project the Trojans as a prime frontrunner for the Pac-12 Championship next year.
USC has been in this spot before — well, kind of.
When USC finished last season with 21 wins and an NCAA Tournament appearance, admittedly smaller but existent buzz began building up about what the Trojans could accomplish in the 2017 campaign. However, the Trojans were unable to retain valuable pieces in former standout guards Julian Jacobs and forward Nikola Jovanovic, who both opted to declare for the NBA Draft.
Who knows how much more grand this season could have been had the Trojans possessed Jacobs’ senior leadership and Jovanovic’s big frame?
Since taking the USC head coaching gig back in 2013, Enfield has done nothing but revitalize this basketball program. USC is undoubtedly back on the map as a program on the rise after appearing in back-to-back NCAA Tournaments and picking up a pair of impressive tournament wins this past week.
While Enfield has shown an impressive ability to lure highly touted local recruits to USC (think Metu, Boatwright and junior guards Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin), he must now show his abilities in retaining these talents for the coming season. The test is not gaining star power, but retaining it.
Metu, who finished with a game-high 28 points in USC’s loss to Baylor, was selected as the Pac-12’s Most Improved Player this season. He finished the season averaging 14.8 points and 7.8 rebounds per game (a team high).
Boatwright was the Trojans’ leading scorer in 2017, averaging 15.1 points per game. In USC’s First Four win over Providence, Boatwright recorded a game-high 24 points.
To think that there hasn’t been chatter concerning Metu or Boatwright’s future in the NBA would be incredibly naive. Both players have exhibited great upside through two seasons, and you just know that friends, family and likely even agents have been in their ears about the prospect of going pro this offseason.
“We want what’s best for our players,” Enfield said. “If that means to have an opportunity to go play in the NBA, that’s great. We’re all for that. If it means coming back to school and being a sure — and improving your opportunity to have guaranteed money or to be a higher pick, to be more NBA ready. But that’s not up to me.”
This offseason will be a pivotal one for USC, but its objective is actually quite simple. Keep your young nucleus of Boatwright and Metu to fuel the hype train, or fail to retain them and start looking for another dynamic youngster to carry your team.

There were 32 games in the first round so  21 for 21 doesn’t add up. What happened with the other 11 games?
The team only got past the 1st round was the bottom line. Enfield went to the sweet sixteen with FGCU probably
with lesser talent. He needs to schedule a lot better ooc teams to prepare for the conference season where he had
one quality win over the ‘ruins. This way it should prevent a play-in game if you make the ncaa tourney.

Aileen Xu is an artist of life.
Her silvery lavender hair flows airily past her shoulders, and when she speaks, her voice evokes a soulful sense of calm.
“You and I — everybody is an artist of life, meaning we have the power to create our life in any way that we want,” Xu said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Xu is a lifestyle blogger, YouTuber, content creator and artist. Yet, she is not the quintessential beauty blogger. Her channel, Lavendaire, is a compilation of her creative and spiritual journey in spreading self-love, positivity and strength to over 138,000 subscribers. Xu embraces her role as a content creator; she features rising artists from her creative community while showcasing tips on personal growth, wellbeing and lifestyle design through videos, podcasts and blog posts.
Xu attempts to make life her work of art, through her interests in lifestyle design, organization and aestheticism. Although her channel represents years of carefully prepared artistic works, the roots of Lavendaire stem from her undergraduate experiences nine years ago at USC, where she pursued a degree in business administration.
Xu was one of many freshmen who entered their undergraduate years unsure of their career path.
“During those years … I was lost,” Xu said. “I didn’t really know what I was going to do.”
She immersed herself in a wide range of extracurricular activities in business organizations and professional clubs, but Xu also pursued performance, dance and music through hip-hop dance team Chaotic 3, her music YouTube channel and cultural shows with the Chinese American Student Association.  Through the Marshall School of Business, she also completed a variety of internships in industries ranging from fashion to entertainment.
But she never felt like those jobs were meant for her.
In her semester abroad in Milan, Italy during her senior year, Xu had a moment of realization.
Xu embraced the challenges and small changes in lifestyle habits shortly after Milan that would soon evolve into her current channel and blog, Lavendaire. She began journaling, reading and spending time reflecting on herself.
Xu’s Milan trip, coupled with her involvements abroad in Panama with the Global Business Brigades program, helped shed light on her career. She realized that she did not only want to pursue her own passions; she wanted to help and give back to others.
“It’s like I got to reset my life and reset my way of thinking,” Xu said. “I think that was the time I really started to ask myself those questions: ‘What do I really want to make out of my life?’”
She describes Italy as a soul-searching period that prepared her to venture out after graduation to create a life and career that aligned with her dreams — not anyone else’s.
“I felt like I was the only one who didn’t have a set plan, but then again, [my peers’] set plans didn’t appeal to me,” Xu said.
The pressures of post-graduation took a toll on Xu, but she did not regret her definitive decision to explore her life’s passions. Shortly after graduation, she worked with a startup food festival, the 626 Night Market. During that time, Xu worked as the market’s spokesperson and media relations manager, but due to the job’s flexibility, she was able to pursue her own gigs and eventually establish Lavendaire in 2014.
“I always knew I wanted to be my own boss,” Xu said. “I saw the power [of social media] you can have nowadays — just as an individual — you could build an influence and do a lot with that.”
True to her word, Xu crafted her own brand and developed a following through her Youtube, Instagram, Soundcloud, Twitter and personal blog.
Xu sought to create a tight-knit online community as an influencer. She is a social entrepreneur, and her online platforms effectively market herself, her talents and her story.
Six months ago, Xu launched her “Artist of Life” project on her channel. In her first video of the series, she seeks to define her lifestyle as an artist of life.
“Life is an art — it’s the ultimate form of self-expression,” Xu says in the video.
This mantra reflects Xu’s perspective on life, using her creative works to convey this mindset. She recently sold out her 2017 Artist of Life workbook, a notebook that helps users plan out a successful and productive year.
She developed many of the life planning and organizational techniques over the years or learned them from others during her journey.
“I thought that I could compile it all into a book — something I wish I had when I was 20 or 21,” Xu said.
Despite her accomplishments, Xu has had her fair share of rejections and failures, to which she attributes her success. She describes her personal losses and failures as stepping stones to her current lifestyle — one that stresses upon self-improvement, love, positivity and well-being.

New horror film The Belko Experiment preys upon the twisted mind games people play in their heads: If everyone in this room were trapped and told to kill one another, what would they do? Who would try to make alliances? Who would throw the first punch? Would most people try to hide or go right into the fight? What are possible weapons? Greg McLean’s The Belko Experiment, which premiered March 17, answers these questions in a hilariously thrilling and extremely graphic horror movie.
The movie begins with a normal day at Belko, an American company in Colombia. But Mike Melch (John Gallagher Jr.), the protagonist and an employee at Belko, notices that something is off — all the locals are gone and there is extra security in the company.
Suddenly, thick metal walls cover every window, trapping the employees inside. A mysterious voice booms over a speaker, commanding the employees to kill each other. Everyone assumes it is a dark, twisted prank, and chaos breaks loose, until COO Barry Norris (Tony Goldwyn) gathers everyone in the lobby to discuss options. No one has cellular reception or Internet to contact the outside world; they are completely trapped.
At this point, the employees, and likewise the audience, wonder how the mysterious voice will enforce its devilish demands, until an employee’s head explodes. Then, more employees’ heads explode. The film’s weakest point, but necessary for the premise, explains that every employee had a tracking chip implanted in their head so that they could be found if they were kidnapped. The tracking chip is also an explosive.
Now the voice says that either the employees kill 30 people or they will explode 60. This is where the movie shines; it does not dwell on ethical arguments about what’s right, who deserves to live or other heavy questions. It does not pretend to be concerned with grand statements on morality — it’s about watching people kill each other in vivid bloody detail.
Also a little convenient, the company has a storage of guns which allows most of the deaths to be quick and easy — although still extremely bloody. Of course there are the campier, gorier deaths by office supplies. Highlights include death by kitchen knives, a paper cutter and a roll of tape.
The Belko Experiment follows in the tradition of elimination style action and horror movies like Hunger Games and Saw. It is most similar to Battle Royale, a Japanese movie with almost exactly the same premise except it is  set in a high school.
Different from other iterations of a similar premise is The Belko Experiment’s strong sense of humor. It takes the cliches and boredom of office life to a brutal extreme; when an employee getting viciously murdered in a bathroom, it cuts to the bloodied “Employees Must Wash Their Hands” sign. Spanish pop music blasts over gruesome deaths to lighten the mood. Speaking at the movie’s screening at the School of Cinematic Arts, director Greg McClain admits that he sees the movie as “silly.” The sentiment is not an insult to the work, but rather an accurate description of the niche it seeks to fill — high energy, thrilling, cheeky violence.
The film has a few beautiful shots — of course they are of people killing each other, but with some great moments of cinematography. The lighting changes from the normal world of sunlight and fluorescent office lights to a more surreal abstracted lighting lit by red lights and fire as the carnage gets worse.
McClain briefly discusses possible messages of the film, like the evils of corporatism and the devaluation of human life, but even he does not seem particularly convinced. A fun frantic movie for those with strong stomachs, The Belko Experiment delivers.

In the final rushed hour of packing before my 8:30 a.m. flight, I seriously considered leaving behind my laptop. After all, it’s spring break and the Wi-Fi will be spotty, and how much work am I really going to get done anyway? Nevertheless, I lugged that hunk of metal to LAX, put it in its own bin to go through security and cracked it open for the least amount of time as possible during my week in Costa Rica.
I had a similar aversion to the running shoes I packed for Costa Rica as well. They’re a pain because they’re so big — I usually have to wear them on the plane to save room in my suitcase. I knew I would use them on some of the hikes we were doing, but whether or not I would use them for their intended purpose was a different story.
In theory, running in an exotic locale such as Costa Rica sounds romantic, but it wasn’t enough motivation for me to overcome the pull of a hammock or the week-long negligence of an alarm clock.
Actually, that makes it sound as if my friends and I were as active as the Costa Rican sloths. We weren’t. Most days, we got up early to squeeze adventure into every hour of our spring break: horseback riding, hot springs, ziplining, rainforest hikes and swimming in a green crater on top of a volcano.
By the end of the day, we were exhausted. As I was too exhausted, the same excuse that usually plagued my busy non-vacation days won out over exotic exercise.
At the end of the week, though, my friends and I took the last few days at a picturesque resort town to really relax. There were no excursions planned on these days, only hot dates with the sand and the sea. On our last full day of vacation, we decided to get up early and go for that beach run that we had been talking about the entire trip.
The weather report said it was supposed to be 80 degrees Fahrenheit by 8 a.m., so we got up at 7:30 a.m. to beat the heat. The beach had fine sand and a sparse scattering of seashells, making it the perfect place to try the barefoot running I have always been so curious about. My running buddy Jenny and I took off across the wet sand with the ocean waves coming up to nip at our feet every few minutes.
Almost immediately, we could feel the burn in our calves and achilles and feet. All of those muscles that are usually cushioned and cradled in our running shoes were now working overtime to keep propelling us forward. Not to mention, the wind whipping across the waves was almost as much of a hindrance as the sinking sand beneath our feet.
We ran to one end of the beach and then to the other, a total of four miles in all. To my aching muscles, it felt like six at least.
To my mind though, it felt like two miles of novelty. Jenny followed in the footsteps of the horses that were trotting through the sand. I raced a dog and nimbly avoided some stray coconuts. After our run, we were relieved to dip our feet in the cold Pacific water and stretch out our muscles with a little beach yoga. Not an hour later, we were out for the count, asleep at our hostel for the best two-hour nap of our lives.
If every run would have been as exhausting as our beach workout, I’m not sure we would have had the opportunity to fit in all of the other activities, the ones that Costa Rica is known for. Jenny and I got blisters on the bottom of our feet from our barefoot running and the post-run nap cut into our afternoon beach time. It was a fun experience, but I don’t feel guilty for skipping out on runs earlier in the week.
There are so many other ways to make the most of a getaway. I’ll still be packing my sneakers for the next trip, but I won’t have any high ambitions for a regular workout on vacation. My laptop, on the other hand, can stay at home next time.
As they say in Costa Rica, pura vida!

Music distribution has changed drastically over the last few years. With the introduction of streaming platforms like Spotify, Tidal and Apple Music, artists have tailored their marketing strategies to fit in with new trends in music streaming. One such artist is R&B and hip-hop artist Drake.
In 2016, Drake released his fourth and most commercially successful studio album Views. The album broke sales records and set a new trend for streaming in the new age of music. While Views failed to garner the critical acclaim of the rapper’s earlier work, it was a major success among fans and led to a stadium tour that only further established Drake as the biggest rapper in music today.
In keeping with the momentum of his Summer Sixteen Tour, Drake announced his new playlist More Life on March 18. The collection of songs contains 22 tracks and is equal in length to Views. What sets the work apart from a mixtape or studio album is its informal presentation. It plays as more of several glimpses into Drake’s life than a cohesive work. More Life is better than Views in several ways, and Drake brilliantly utilizes a new and original marketing strategy to release the project.
Drake and his label OVO debuted the playlist More Life on the 39th episode of OVO Sound Radio, a radio station on the streaming platform Apple Music. This release strategy allowed Drake to be more experimental with the work. Instead of seeking to develop a cohesive body of work with a single concept like Views attempted to do, Drake was able to release a work that played as more of a stream of consciousness. More Life succeeds in the areas that Views fails because of its branding as a playlist.
The work opens with back to back uptempo tracks “Free Smoke” and “No Long Talk (feat. Giggs).” With these introductory songs, Drake reminds his listeners that he’s still the champion of rap and can set aside his softer side, replacing it with harder flows. After these tracks, though, Drake returns to his successful dancehall formula with the tracks “Passionfruit,” “Get it Together,” “Madiba Riddim” and “Blem.”
While some of these tracks are far stronger than others, their aesthetic is comforting and provides fans of “One Dance” and “Controlla” with more of the same. One track, “Jorja’s Interlude,” even contains a sample of Drake’s own “Doing It Wrong,” implying Drake’s seeking to reclaim the glory associated with his peak with 2011’s Take Care.
While the curation of More Life is impressive and original, it does not tread much new ground in terms of content. Like in Views, Drake is still plagued by the alienation of being at the top of the music industry, and he remains skeptical of his peers and ex-girlfriends. This topic is what heavily burdened Views, and it weighs down More Life as well.
What’s most interesting is that these attitudes possessed by Drake are addressed by his own mother on the track “Can’t Have Everything.” Drake raps about his mom telling him to stop worrying about other people’s opinions and having a more positive mindset. There are a few glimpses into the heights Drake can reach, with tracks like “Lose You,” “Ice Melts (feat. Young Thug)” and “Do Not Disturb.” “Ice Melts” provided a lighter tone that was absent from the overserious Views, and More Life could have benefited from more tracks like it. While More Life indulges in a lot of the same subject matter, it shows Drake working to return to form.
In terms of content, More Life is typical Drake. It shows him using the same conversation topics to say the same thing. Stylistically, however, More Life is incredibly impressive. Featuring popular artists and rappers such as Young Thug, Travis Scott, Sampha and Quavo, More Life diversifies Drake’s musical style. “Do Not Disturb” is a featured outtro that perfectly reflects the playlist’s nuances. While inconsistent in quality, More Life is an ambitious addition to Drake’s discography.

John R. Rogers High School in Spokane, Washington is on a mission to decrease the gap between the number of students from high-income and low-income families who go to college, according to a report by The New York Times published earlier this month. The district has undertaken vast changes in the last five years to correct the education inequality that persists in public high schools, and has produced tangible results. More challenging — but also more encouraging — academic environments could be key to helping students, regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds, to access higher education.
Lori Wyborney, the principal at Rogers High, encouraged tougher schedules and more rigorous classes in an effort to increase low-income students’ prospects for attending college, and took it upon herself to personally convince students to take Advanced Placement classes. Already seeing improvement in student performance each semester, Rogers High channeled a vision for low-income students that gives hope to poor students across the United States.
In 2014, 65 percent of students from Spokane high schools who did not receive reduced-price lunches continued on to higher education, compared with 48 percent of students from Spokane high schools who did not. The national average demonstrates a larger gap, with 48 percent of reduced-lunch price students in the United States going on to post-high school education, compared to 81 percent who are not on a subsidized lunch program.
This gap stems from students’ socioeconomic backgrounds, including fewer extracurricular opportunities, inability to pay for college or register for standardized tests, language barriers and, of course, less access to tutoring services. Rogers High has attempted to overcome lack of opportunity by providing additional resources, paying for testing and educating low-income students about available scholarships.
At Rogers High, Wyborney implemented a heavier curriculum and nixed unnecessary and less challenging classes. By pushing students who may believe that they would be unable to succeed in AP classes, Wyborney makes the possibility of college not just a hope but rather a tangible goal.
Regardless of academic performance, Wyborney believes these challenging classes develop skills needed by future college students. Wyborney regularly meets with assistant principals and charts down the progress of individual students. If the administration believes that a student could be successful in a more difficult class, they pull aside the student and directly encourage them to try the class.
Students who feel they now have an academic goal will spend more time studying and partaking in extracurricular activities, leading to lifestyle changes. When a school environment is academically driven, those who take challenging courses create a ripple effect in which students see their fellow classmates achieving previously inconceivable goals. By the time these lower-income students reach a university or community college, they are more prepared and able to handle the load of college classes.
Still, additional measures must be taken both by Rogers High and other schools around the country. While completing more challenging curricula and partaking in AP classes help these students’ chances of college admission, success within these classes is integral. Additional tutoring is expensive and unrealistic for low-income students. This could create imbalance within the classroom and may lead to lower grades among lower-income students. While encouraging students to take AP classes can make them feel more competent and capable of attending college, there are other students who may struggle to keep up, fall far behind and be discouraged on their path to higher education. Schools must match increased pushes to take advanced classes with increased access to tutoring and academic resources.
That being said, Wyborney’s plan to tackle academic disparities in economically diverse school districts is a step in the right direction to combating inequality. Treating students as individuals and investing time to better their academic future must be a priority among administrations of public schools across the nation. At the end of the day, confidence in individual students’ potential is among the most important things a school can offer its students ,regardless of how much or little funding it has.

On March 11, Indian American education worker Shree Chauhan posted a video to Twitter in which she can be heard interrogating Press Secretary Sean Spicer at a Washington, D.C. Apple Store. The video, which sparked national interest only briefly before fading back into the Washington news cycle, depicts Spicer awkwardly trying to evade Chauhan as she presses him: “How does it feel to work for a fascist?” and “Have you committed treason, too, just like the president?”
At one point, Spicer turns to Chauhan, who is from New York, and thinly smiles. “Such a great country that allows you to be here,” he tells her.
As an Asian American growing up in Ohio it was a sentiment I felt and heard everywhere: at school, at restaurants, going to the mall with my family on weekends. One of the first ways I was made to realize my race was a classmate asking me, when we were both four years old, “Zoe, are you adopted?”
If you are yellow or brown in this country, society instills in you from childhood a deep and pervasive alienation that cannot easily be shaken off. It is the overwhelming sense that you must not be native-born, that you do not belong to this country and that this country does not belong to you.
And now, with Trump’s travel ban and the hostile, xenophobic and distinctly un-American uproar it conjures, that feeling is expanding. Marked by violence and death, the stakes are rising. Seemingly innocuous comments by anyone — but especially by the  United States press secretary — should not go ignored by the public.
Thus, I cannot fathom why the video was not shared more widely, why it did not appear to go viral on social media and why there was no outrage over Spicer’s statements. In light of the recent spate of violence directed toward people of  SouthAsian descent Spicer’s comment is unconscionable. Saturday Night Live and Melissa McCarthy, in all her charisma and boisterousness, made a habit of mocking Spicer, but now it is time to contend with him as someone dangerous, reckless and hateful.
The election changed everything, of course, but the theory I still somewhat believe is that prejudice is rooted deep. There are people who make conscious decisions to perpetuate prejudice, but in everyone, racism and sexism and stereotypes are conditioned into instinct. Growing up in this broken modern world, you cannot avoid it. Education, empathy and friendships with people of different backgrounds can change these instincts — but not when an individual sets himself or herself averse to change. Not when people put blame on immigrants and tell brown Americans to leave the country and label every news outlet that holds the president accountable as fake and corrupt.
When people do make conscious choices to shame and belittle and scapegoat minorities, it moves beyond the bounds of fixable, rectifiable prejudice and into the categorization of hate. And what Spicer said to Chauhan in the Apple Store two Saturdays ago was hate. It was a deliberate action to offend and denigrate the citizenship of an American with whom it is his job to communicate.
It didn’t matter whether Spicer knew he was being recorded or not — he didn’t care. In order to push back the woman trying to hold him accountable, he insulted her race and made assumptions about her nationality. This is intolerable from anyone, but especially from the mouthpiece for the White House.
Make no mistake, this is the same vein of hatred that recently killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounded Alok Madasani at a Kansas bar, that shot Deep Rai outside his own home. Asian Americans — along with several minority groups — are currently being targeted in this country by people who subscribe to President Donald Trump’s vitriolic xenophobia, and Spicer knows this. He knows it and he doesn’t care — and what’s more, he chooses to perpetuate it. That is something I am willing to neither forgive nor forget.
Spicer does not deserve my respect because he is a racist. He’s a racist who knows the drastic consequences of his own words, and still he spouts them anyway. He is culpable, dangerous, and — as Chauhan’s video demonstrates — extraordinarily reckless. He has access to the most powerful podium in American politics, but he does not care where his words land or who they flatten. Spicer does not care.
But here’s the thing. The public does.

Brief history lesson for young people in college who may not have been paying attention in high school:  Our very young nation was founded by western Europeans who were largely white (and Christian Deists, for that matter).  It should come as no surprise therefore that people in America as well as from around the world, tend to view the average American as someone of white European descent, with judeo-Christian values.  These are ethinic and racial realities, not racist realities.  Even the very term “minority” affirms this fact.  Certainly our nation’s racial makeup has changed through the years through immigration, and acquisition of lands, particularly out West in territory formerly occupied by Mexico.  Legal immigration is welcomed, and will continue to change the “look” of our nation, but there is nothing racist, wrong or even unnatural about wanting to preserve the “values” of America.  Immigrants from decades ago integrated and assimilated into American culture; Immigrants today are less likely to do so, often segregating themselves.  Mr. Spicer was correct in reminding the hostile Marxist who confronted him that she does indeed live in a great country that protects her right to speak out against government, policy and public officials.
Your grammar needs work.  Your days need filling with meaningful tasking.  Your opinions need a foundation of clarity.  You need an intellectual spanking.
My god you’re one emotionally messed up kid.  You’re so off base on your racist comments that if this were a baseball game you would be tagged out before touching first base.  There reason that attack against Spicer was not more newsworthy than it was is because the Trump hater that run the media spin this hateful attack against Spicer into some things g positive for the Left, even if making it up.  You have made up a situation that has no bearing in fact.  But then again, you’re a self obsessed late teenager who thinks you know everything.  Guess what?  You are a college student. You don’t know real life and won’t for many years after graduation.  Using your Asian heritage as a crutch to profess your own bias against others is disgusting.  I’m sure you were raised better than that.

What do you think of when you think Los Angeles? Maybe palm trees, sunny skies or waves crashing on beautiful shores. The weather is mild and lovely; a light jacket would suffice on warmer months (and even some days in winter). There is Hollywood and the entertainment scene, with its horde of aspiring actors, A-listers, models, directors and musicians.
With nearly 13 million residents in the greater Los Angeles area, there is a crowd no matter where you go. Such a diverse population leads many things to do and explore in the city, but sometimes we students need a time for ourselves — a moment of rest and serenity, away from everything.
One of the things I love most about Los Angeles is its proximity to a plethora of destinations that are so different from the city. We can find places that are quiet and remote, places where you can actually see the stars (the real ones in the sky). Here are a few of my favorites.

Camping in the Desert: Joshua Tree National Park
The Joshua Tree National Park is like a scene out of a science-fiction movie. The trees look strange, the rocks stands stacked on each other, the desert stretches out to the horizon. The sky turns blood-red at sunset. And as the night falls, countless stars pepper the sky. I had been to many camping trips here, sometimes armed with telescopes (I saw Saturn once, Jupiter twice, Pleiades many times and wished upon several shooting stars). There are modern amenities available in some of the camping grounds, but make sure to bring plenty of layers! While afternoons are blinding hot, winters and nights can be freezing.

Up in the Mountains: Big Bear and Lake Arrowhead
Big Bear is a beloved destination for skiing and snowboarding. Last weekend, I went to stay there for two days and it was still snowing in late February (the day after the snow shower, we had a snowball fight and, afterward, hot chocolate in the warmth of the living room).  You can rent a cabin and enjoy a quiet, chilly mini-vacation with friends and family.


A Bus Ride Away: Santa Barbara, San Diego, Palm Springs
Yes, it’s possible to go on day trips to different cities from Los Angeles. If you drive, good for you! If you, like me, don’t know how to drive, the bus is there to save you! Once, I even took a bus to Las Vegas with a couple of friends (none of us wanted to drive there – the journey took five hours).

Island Life: Catalina
Catalina Island is a great place to relax and unwind. The beaches are very clean, the water so clear that you can see the fishes. The pace of everything is slower, somehow, and it is perfect for a day trip. Here’s a little advice for those interested: go on your birthday — the boat ride will be free!
The beauty of it is how close everything is to Los Angeles. Each is only a few hours’ drive (or boat ride) away. The next time you feel like you need to get away from the city, think of these places and go on an adventure!

One difficult aspect of adjusting to college is getting into a routine of regular exercise and maintaining a healthy diet. For me, it was especially difficult because I was used to nutritious, home-cooked food every night, and I used to play sports in high school. I had the structure of daily exercise at athletic practices, and all the food my family and I ate at home was fresh and organic for the most part. Coming to college, I had trouble integrating exercise into my daily routine, limiting the amount of food I ate at the dining hall and choosing to eat a balanced diet. My first semester, I was especially frazzled because of the unfamiliarity of everything, so I stress-ate, which was problematic for my health. I know that I am not the only one who goes through this trial, and there is nothing wrong with it. First semester of freshman year is a giant adjustment that no one prepares you for, and the last thing you are probably thinking about is working out and eating kale every day. I had bigger problems to overcome: homesickness, stressful classes and trying to make friends and join clubs.
When I came back to school for second semester, I was ready for a fresh start, and I quickly got into a routine of exercising at least three to four times a week and eating balanced and adequately portioned meals. Going to the gym is certainly not an easy thing when you are a busy college student, but if you hold yourself accountable to devoting one or two hours in a day to it, it is possible. It is great stress relief for your body and your mind, and my mental health has been so much better this semester because of it. In terms of eating better, luckily, we go to school in Southern California, so our dining halls have a plethora of healthy options to choose from. Generally speaking, I try to eat a lot of fibrous fruits and vegetables in my meals, some protein and some carbohydrates to balance everything out. I also try to limit myself to indulging in one dessert per day. Salads, stir fried vegetables, fresh cut fruit, fish, chicken, eggs, rice and quinoa are all good options to eat and are easily accessible options at our dining halls. I typically go to Café 84, which is known to have the healthiest food.
Now, I am definitely not saying that I can keep up with eating healthy and working out all the time, but it is definitely something that I am trying to sustain in my life. My advice to my fellow freshmen is not to put enormous amounts of pressure on yourselves to eat healthy and work out all the time but just to keep the idea in the back of your mind. Mental health and bodily health go hand-in-hand, and if we all make more of an effort to be kind to our bodies, the stress of freshman year could be more easily managed.

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
I am writing this in the newsroom to the constant hum of our old Mac desktops. It is five minutes ‘til 5 p.m., five minutes until the newsroom comes alive on Monday evenings to the sound of rapid mouse clicks, furious taps of keyboard keys and spontaneous bursts of laughter from every corner of the room.
Alright, I’m back now. It is 7:17 p.m. — the hexagonal managing table is filled on all sides, we’ve put all our stories into copy and layout is (thankfully) finished on the computer screen. My co-editor Allen and I take turns sitting on the editing chair, clicking away into the night.
Working from 5 p.m. to the obscure hours before midnight sounds exhausting. That’s what I thought, initially, when I started working as Lifestyle editor for the spring semester. I came into the newsroom with one plan: finishing layout and getting out of there as soon as possible. The first few weeks were hard; my eyelids would begin drooping around 9 p.m., and I would fall asleep as soon as I got back to my dorm at around 10:45. 
It was, ironically, a change in my college lifestyle. Gone were the free hours I had to Netflix and take afternoon naps. I didn’t have as much free time to spend with my roommate or lounge around EVK with my first semester friends. I started buying overpriced sandwiches and salads from Seeds, and instead of water, coffee became a supplement for my life blood. But, I’m not complaining — becoming lifestyle editor was a change I didn’t know I needed in my life.
I quote from one of my earliest friends at USC, a fellow freshman and photo editor Trevor Sochocki, “What I do know is that we are a family.” The Daily Trojan gives me a sense of community and family I didn’t know I needed until the second semester of my freshman year, as my friends found their niches in greek life, culture clubs and professional organizations. As clichéd as it sounds, the best memories in the newsroom aren’t from editing stories — it’s from the people. 
It’s from hearing Allen, my co-editor, bark at a screen after I show him a cute dog from the Dogspotting page on Facebook. It’s from mocking Trump’s tweets, calling ourselves fake news and reading angry comments. It’s laughing at the memes page together and complaining when writers forget to use an oxford comma. It’s a sense of family and unity that arises from having a common purpose and destination: to inform and inspire the student body through our stories in the paper. 
As one of the younger section editors on staff, I found mentors in the older managing editors, and I learn something new about journalism every day. My writing is not perfect, and neither am I, but through editing my section’s stories, I develop my own writing styles and techniques. I fall in love with journalism a little more every day, exploring page design and elements of a newsroom I never realized were so critical in print journalism. 
It’s 8:16 p.m. now, and my editor-in-chief hands me the first page of proofs — the editing process that we complete every day before publication. It’s 8:30 p.m., I’m back now and we surprisingly ended the night a bit earlier than usual. 
Working as an editor requires a level of dedication I didn’t envision myself committing to so early in my college career. But, in retrospect, I wouldn’t change a thing. I got used to the lifestyle of an editor sooner than I expected: My body has been conditioned to doing homework to the background chatter of managing, and I come in on Mondays and Wednesdays ready to fight for a plate of Mexican food. 
I became accustomed to our late night Thursday hang outs and the strange jargon of the office – jokes and mannerisms I adapted after spending almost 20 hours a week here. I spend more waking hours here than I do in my room, but maybe my waking hours are better spent here. They’re better spent, I realized, with a group of people who cares about the school, its politics and news as much as I do.
“[…] and complaining when writers forget to use an oxford comma.”
uh, you mean like you did in your own article? not to mention the numerous other errors. does anyone proofread these things?
Do you know what an oxford comma is? There are none in this article. Maybe you should do some research before leaving mean (and ignorant) comments on heartfelt articles.
