At an Annenberg Research Seminar that featured Shane Greenstein from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University on Monday afternoon, students and faculty were able to take part in a conversation about Wikipedia and the influences the user-generated content website has in everyday life.
Greenstein spoke about his research with the website during the lunchtime event.
Though technically titled, “Collective Intelligence and Neutral Point of View: The Case of Wikipedia,” Greenstein put numeric and written data about Wikipedia into perspective by calling students’ attention to their roles as part of the site.
“You are society’s information managers and contributors. If you see something wrong [on Wikipedia], fix it,” Greenstein said after encouraging the audience to register as users on the website.
The site, which was created in 2001, is the sixth most-visited website in the United States behind sites including YouTube and Facebook. Worldwide, the website receives 400 million views per month but Greenstein said that does not mean Wikipedia is an unbiased source.
Described by Greenstein, and in the fine print of the website itself, as “not authoritative,” Wikipedia is in a constant state of change. Students said though it is an important source, it is sometimes unreliable.
“I’m interested with issues that have to do with the Internet … because crowdsourcing major material affects everyone who uses the Internet,” said Kari Storla, a second-year graduate student studying communication.
Wikipedia has three options for contributor involvement. The first is as an administrator, someone who is approved by the company. The second group option is registered contributors, and the third is anonymous users denoted in revisions by their specific computer IP addresses.
In his research, Greenstein took 70,000 articles from the source community of Wikipedia. He emphasized how important the common person’s ability to post and revise content is to his research and the site as a whole. All articles have the ability to be modified in some way, with the exception of more controversial topics, which include President Barack Obama, former President George W. Bush, the Muslim prophet Muhammad and Jesus Christ.
“We chose to look at Wikipedia articles that were not objective, not verifiable and controversial — so we chose U.S. politics,” Greenstein said.
Greenstein found in his research that the more contributors to an article, the less chance there was for bias. Additionally, more revisions from community contributors came less bias, and with less bias came more reliable articles.
Greenstein also noted that the “revision wars” have the ability to consume the website.
“Storage is cheap; you can always add another paragraph,” he said. “That’s an easy way to end a dispute.”
Wikipedia aspires to achieve a neutral point of view by presenting conflicting opinions side by side. The research proved that the website’s success is due to Wikipedia’s ability to “accommodate insiders and tourists.” When the site first began, however, Greenstein said it had a strong liberal bias.
“[It was] so loud you couldn’t find it anywhere but Berkeley, Madison and parts of Cambridge — maybe NBC,” he said.
Swini Tummala, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she saw the seminar as a way to better understand the website she says every student wants to cite but can’t.
“It’s not a site to use as a reference in a paper and I think we, as students, understand that, but from all of this research and data it’s clear why,” Tummala said. “With so many eyes or editors making changes reliability can go either way; more is better only when more is knowledgeable.”
Despite the site sometimes being unreliable, 95 percent of articles are currently revised on average each year. Of these articles, the top 20 percent receive 1,000 revisions each year. This, in conjunction with managing editors, allows the goal of neutrality to become more of a reality, Greenstein said.
Many of the event attendees were doctoral students.
“Collective intelligence is relevant to anyone who pursues education at a higher level,” said Adam Rafkin, a first-year graduate student studying communication.

Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumna Jacki Wells Cisneros pledged $500,000 toward naming the assignment desk at Wallis Annenberg Hall last week.
Giving back, Trojan style · Alumna Jacki Wells Cisneros has pledged $500,000 toward the naming of the assignment desk at the new Wallis Annenberg Hall, which will finish construction in fall 2014. – Photo courtesy of Gretchen Parker
“We started talking about [the donation] over the summer,” said Diana O’Leary, the associate dean of External Relations at Annenberg School of Communication. “The gift was finalized in the fall. We recently reached out to her to ask her if she wouldn’t mind if we could do a press release on it not only to help celebrate and help recognize her generosity, but also to make a statement, too, about the importance of journalism today. To see all the people supporting it really is powerful and has a great impact.”
O’Leary said Wells Cisneros wanted to give back to the journalism community because of her passion for the field. Wells Cisneros also won $266 million in the 2010 MegaMillions jackpot. According to Annenberg’s press release, since then she and her husband have made efforts to give back to their church and alma maters. They also established the Gilbert & Jacki Cisneros Foundation. Previously, Wells Cisneros has worked as a broadcast journalist at KCBS and KNBC in Los Angeles.
“Jacki is passionate about a strong press corps, and about the importance of journalism in today’s society and its impact on democracy,” O’Leary said. “She loved working in the newsroom and she worked at the assignment desk. That combination of her passion for journalism and the opportunity to support something so tied to her roots was really magical [for her].”
The assignment desk will be stationed at the Wallis Annenberg Hall, which will finish construction in fall 2014.
“There is going to be an assignment desk, of which she will name the actual desk,” O’Leary said. “So when you or when someone’s running on deadline you will be at the Jacki and Gilbert Cisneros assignment desk and you will report into the Jacki and Gilbert Cisneros assignment desk.”
Serena Cha, professor of professional practice and director of Annenberg TV News, said she is excited about the donation and how it will impact Annenberg and its students. Cha will also begin her tenure as the executive director of the Annenberg Media Center for Wallis Annenberg Hall next fall.
“The [Jacki and Gilbert] Cisneros assignment desk will be the most visible focal point for news gathering and timely interaction in our new Media Center,” Cha said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Wells Cisneros is sharing her passion for strong journalism and, with her husband, supporting future generations by establishing a dynamic hub where students will connect with the world, find great stories and discover new ways to communicate.”
Cha remembered working with Wells Cisneros in local TV news. In an email to the Daily Trojan, Cha recalled answering a call from a news manager and recommending hiring Wells Cisneros immediately.
“Jacki had the proven ability to excel in a newsroom under intense deadline pressure,” Cha said.
O’Leary said she was “absolutely thrilled” when Wells Cisneros first approached her with interest in donating.
“I think it will have a very powerful impact on our school, on our journalism program and the students,” O’Leary said. “Journalism is a field that is discussed in terms of disruption and what’s going to happen to it, and investments like this from our community leaders show that strong journalism is alive and well, and is worthy of their support.”

Congressman Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.) spoke to the School of Social Work’s SOWK 350: “Adolescent Gang Intervention” course about gang intervention legislation Monday morning in the Montgomery Ross Fisher Building.
School of Social Work Vice Dean R. Paul Maiden introduced Cardenas and made him an “honorary Trojan,” with the gift of a USC lapel pin.
Looking back · Congressman Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.) reflects on his childhood and what caused him to become a politician on Monday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Cardenas and his 10 siblings were raised in Pacoima, Calif. after their parents, who had a first and second grade education, emigrated from Mexico. After getting a degree in electrical engineering from University of California, Santa Barbara, he served in the California State Assembly and Los Angeles City Council, before being elected to the United States House of Representatives.
“I was one of those kids who did a few dumb things but thank God not dumb enough to end up in handcuffs. My 10 brothers and sisters were never in the backseat of a police car, nor was I,” Cardenas said. “And we grew up in a neighborhood where it was easy to end up in the backseat of a police car.”
After working in engineering and real estate for a short time, Cardenas said his friend convinced him to run for state assembly.
“All of the sudden, a friend of mine interrupted my life and said, ‘You need to run for state assembly,’” Cardenas said. “And I laughed and said, ‘People like me don’t run for Congress.’ And what I meant in my mind by ‘people like me don’t run for office’ was that people of color don’t run for office.”
Cardenas has since worked in politics for more than 15 years. He said he has made gang intervention his core policy issue during his tenure on the state assembly, city council and now Congress.
“My objective is to make sure that intervention prevention is part of every funding cycle at the local government level, at the state government level and the federal government,” he said.
At the state Assembly level, Cardenas partnered with former state senator and current Congressman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to create the Schiff-Cardenas Juvenile Justice Crime Prevention Act. Since assuming office as a representative earlier this year, Cardenas has introduced a gang intervention bill in Congress that he said was “lighter” than he’d like to to be.
“I introduced a bill to introduce them to the terminology of gang intervention, to introduce them to the idea that gang prevention and intervention is something we should be focusing on,” Cardenas explained. “So that’s my first bill in Washington. It’s not as big and bad as the Schiff-Cardenas Act.”
Cardenas and Robert Hernandez, an adjunct lecturer and professor of the “Adolescent Gang Intervention” course, have been partners in the intiative to focus on gang intervention.
“We’ve been working on this issue for the past five years together,” Hernandez said of the partnership.
Hernandez teaches the gang intervention course and many of his students who attended said the event reinforced what they have been talking about in class.
“It was really great that what we’re learning is actually going into policymaking,” Beatriz Aguilar, a senior majoring in psychology, said. “It’s actually going into full effect, it’s not just that we’re talking about it, it’s happening at the national, at the House [of Representatives] level.”
Many graduate level students studying social work were also impressed by Cardenas’ message.
“I thought it was inspiring,” said Chris Blankenship, a second-year master’s student. “It was great that he was really pushing the idea that we can make change here at the school just by learning and then informing legislators and helping them to design policy.”

The Roski School of Fine Arts announced that it changed its name to the USC Roski School of Art and Design on Monday.
“The new name represents a subtle yet momentous shift in how our students identify themselves and their work within contemporary visual culture,” Roski Dean Erica Muhl said in a press release. “Tailoring ‘Fine Arts’ to ‘Art’ reflects an expanded definition of contemporary art practice, inclusive of traditional and new media. The new name points at a new direction for the school, according to the press release. This fall, Roski presented its first-ever graphic design course in fashion marketing and announced a new minor in 3-D design. The lecture program this spring will include talks in both art and design, which are meant to engage students in the larger conversation about art in the field today.
“USC Roski’s intradisciplinary program fosters a community of artistic exchange in which students engage with traditional techniques and cutting-edge technologies,” USC Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Elizabeth Garrett said in a press release. “USC scholars in virtually every field rely on visual strategies of perception and communication to imagine, explain and transmit their work in the world.”
This approach to art has helped uphold Roski’s reputation for producing successful alumni across a spectrum of professions. In 2012, U.S. News & World Report ranked Roski eighth in the nation in multimedia and visual education.
At the undergraduate level, Roski offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a Bachelor of Arts. At the graduate level, it offers a Master of Fine Arts and a Master in Curatorial Studies.

On Monday, USC students celebrated the 10th annual Conquest in McCarthy Quad. The tradition highlighted Trojan spirit and athletics as USC prepares to play crosstown rival UCLA on Saturday. The event, which featured a carnival and concert headlined by platinum-selling artist Jason Derulo, was hosted by the USC Concerts Committee in conjunction with Undergraduate Student Government and the Office of Campus Activities. The event was open to all students free of charge.
‘Don’t Wanna Go Home’ · Featured artist Jason Derulo performs in front of students during Conquest on Monday night at McCarthy Quad. – Benjamin Dunn | El Rodeo
Heather McDonald, a comedienne and USC alumna, co-hosted the event along with fellow comedian and actor Steve Rannazzisi. They led the crowd in introducing USC athletic teams, along with announcements of events during the night. At one point during the night, the event experienced technical difficulties in the traditional burning of a Bruin bear effigy. After a few minutes, however, the crowd began a new countdown and the wooden bear exploded into fireworks and a bonfire in front of Doheny Memorial Library. A fireworks display, featuring USC-colored cardinal and gold fireworks, lit up the sky for several minutes.
“That bear is burning and these girls are burning a lot of calories,” McDonald joked. “There’s like 25 teams here.”
The Trojan Marching Band also performed alongside the Song Girls and Spirit Leaders. Along with celebrating the 10th year of Conquest, this year also marks 125 years of Trojan athletics and 45 years since the introduction of the Song Girls into USC events.
Planning for the event proved to be more complicated than usual since the UCLA rivalry game falls on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Concerts Committee, however, was able to work around the event this year by changing the concert from Thursday, when it is usually hosted, to Monday. Concerts Committee also faced a tough decision in picking a performer.
“It is impossible to pick an artist that makes everybody happy but the committee considers the variety of tastes among the student body. Any USC student is welcome to attend our meetings [on Monday nights] and offer input and suggestions for who to bring to perform at USC,” said Alison Wotton, the co-assistant director of Program Board Concerts.
Some students felt that Jason Derulo was not the most appropriate choice given that many of his most popular songs are from several years ago.
“USC is amazing in that we have a concert Monday night. But we could have had somebody more relevant,” said Natalie Li, a freshman majoring in biology. She added, however, that “Whatcha Say” was her favorite Jason Derulo song. “I’m glad he played that one,” she said.
Many students enjoyed other aspects of the event besides the concert. “I’m enjoying the spirit and the food. And Jason of course,” said Elli Wang, a freshman majoring in environmental studies.
The food trucks proved to be a particularly popular aspect of the event.
“I’m happy they have food trucks here and I’m happy about the Jason Derulo concert. My friends have been talking a lot about it,” said Megan Joseph, a freshman majoring in computer engineering and computer science.
The concert opened with DJ Papo, billed as the official DJ for Jason Derulo. He played remixes as the crowd waited for Derulo, who came on stage and opened his set with “In My Head.” He played a variety of his songs throughout his time onstage, including crowd favorites “Whatcha Say” and “Marry Me.”
Students said they enjoyed the music more as the night went on.
“I think he’s a smooth dancer,”   said Linyan Tian, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “He’s super charismatic and he’s just as good in person as he is in the studio.”

Im sorry, but not only did the DJ suck, but the twerking competition certainly brought USC to a new low….programming board should be ashamed of themselves…last year’s conquest was so much better…this year just stank…
No mention of the twerking competition. Not one of USC’s most prestigious moments, haha.

After ending their regular season with a heart-wrenching, double-overtime defeat to crosstown rival UCLA, the five-time defending champions and fourth-ranked men’s water polo team head up to Stockton, Calif. this weekend to begin post-season play at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament.
Lead the charge · USC junior driver Kostas Genidounias has been a consistent threat for the Trojans, leading the team with 70 goals scored. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
In the quarterfinals on Friday, USC (23-4, 5-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will be matched up with No. 5 Cal (16-7, 4-4 MPSF) for the second time this year. In the two teams’ first meeting up in Berkeley, the Trojans defeated Cal 11-9 in come-from-behind fashion.
Last year, USC, who was slated as the No. 1 seed, defeated the Golden Bears in the championship game of the conference tournament, 9-5. They got to the title game after defeating Stanford, 11-10, in the semifinals, and UC Santa Barbara, 17-9, in the quarterfinals.
If the Trojans pull off another victory against the Golden Bears, then on Saturday they would face the winner of the game between No. 1 Pacific and No. 7 UC Irvine.
A matchup with Pacific, who will have home-pool advantage as the hosts of the tournament, could help redeem the Trojans after they lost on the road to the Tigers in conference play, 10-6, earlier this month. The Tigers have a strong asset in MPSF leading scorer Balazs Erdelyi.
Before looking too far ahead, the Trojans will have to overcome a tough Cal team that narrowly lost its regular season finale to its Bay Area rivals in No. 1 Stanford, 11-10.
Cal had three players with 30-plus goals on the year including junior attacker Aleksa Saponjic, sophomore attacker Colin Mulcahy and senior attacker Collin Smith. Senior goalie Michael Boggan is averaging just more than seven saves per match.
“We always talk about [how] defense wins championships. Going into the MPSF tournament it’s all going to be about defense,” senior two-meter Jeremy Davie said. “We got one of the best offenses in the country, [and] we know we’re going to get the job done at that end. It’s all defense from here.”
The Trojans have netted 419 goals this season led by a 70-goal scorer in junior driver Kostas Genidounias. USC’s all-time leading goal scorer senior driver Nikola Vavic isn’t very far behind with 67 goals.
After defeating the Trojans last week, UCLA got the No. 1 and will take on No. 6 UC Santa Barbara in their first-round matchup.
USC will begin defending their MPSF tournament championship in the pool against the Golden Bears on Friday at 3 p.m. If the Trojans win their first two games, they will play for the conference championship at the same time on Sunday.

At this time I am going away to do my breakfast, once having my breakfast coming yet again to read more news.
We stumbled over here different page and thought I might check things out. I like what I see so now i’m following you. Look forward to checking out your web page repeatedly.
So can we all agree that UOP will beat USC and win the MPSF?
Undeniably believe that which you said. Your favorite justification seemed to be on the internet the easiest thing to be aware of. I say to you, I certainly get annoyed while people consider worries that they just do not know about. You managed to hit the nail upon the top and also defined out the whole thing without having side effect , people could take a signal. Will likely be back to get more. Thanks
What’s up to every one, the contents existing at this web site are in fact remarkable for people experience, well, keep up the good work fellows.

After dropping two straight matches on the road, the eighth-ranked USC women’s volleyball team is looking to finish the season strong coming off of two sweeps of their rivals from the state of Arizona in last weekend’s matches. Now only two tests remain: the ever-dangerous UCLA Bruins and the upstart Colorado Buffaloes.

The Women of Troy (24-5, 14-4 Pac-12) received a major shot in the arm after beating Arizona and Arizona State at home this past weekend and look to keep the momentum up as the regular season is only two matches away from its end. Though USC is mathematically out of the race for the Pac-12 championship with Washington, it is guaranteed at least the No. 3 spot in the conference and has a fighting chance at passing Stanford for runner-up.
All that remains between the Women of Troy and a favorable NCAA tournament berth this season are two schools that, on paper, should be no match for the talent on USC’s roster. This season, however, has told a different story. USC can attest to falling in matches that they should have in fact won — as recently as two weekends ago the Women of Troy were beaten by a Washington State team that is ranked second-to-last in the Pac-12 — and their opponents this week have had their share of surprise wins over the course of the season.
Wednesday’s opponent, UCLA (15-13, 6-12), is only a spot above Washington State in the conference standings but pulled off a surprise sweep against Arizona — a team that earlier this year swept USC — last weekend. Add in the factors of the crosstown rivalry and the game’s location in Westwood and this match doesn’t seem as much of a formality anymore.
When the teams last met, the then-No. 4 Women of Troy demolished the then-No. 11 ranked Bruins in four sets at the Galen Center as freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu led the way with 17 kills. Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard posted 13 kills of her own, and the Trojan defense came alive with three or more blocks from four different players. Since that time, both schools have dropped in the rankings (though UCLA’s plummet has been more precipitous), but USC head coach Mick Haley is expecting nothing less than a hard-fought match.
“We know UCLA still has a chance to get into the NCAA tournament,” Haley said. “I can’t imagine a tournament without a UCLA team in it, and they’re that close to not making it in. They’ll have to beat us to get into the tournament, so I would look for a very spirited effort by the Bruins.”
The Women of Troy will take the following day off for Thanksgiving and will then return home to face off against Colorado (16-12, 8-10) who has been the indisputable surprise team in the conference. Though they have a losing conference record, the Buffaloes have been able to take down mighty Washington, a feat that the Women of Troy have yet to accomplish this year. Friday’s match will be the first and only meeting between the schools this regular season.
As the season comes to a close, the play of USC’s younger players becomes magnified. Senior leaders such as Olgard and libero Natalie Hagglund are tried and true in late-season games, but the youthful core of this year’s team remains largely untested. Last weekend’s matches provided optimism for their future, however, and Haley is pleased with what he has seen from them.
“[Freshman outside hitter Elise] Ruddins looks more comfortable than she has all season,” Haley said. “I think she’s getting confident with her abilities. [Freshman setter Alice] Pizzasegola is starting to relax and compete. Nwanebu has been exceptional every week. When the kids are playing well and look like they’re having fun, that’s a great thing.”
Haley will look for similar efforts from his young players as they look to close out the season strong with two final matches in Los Angeles. After this weekend the team will look ahead to the NCAA tournament, where it have a chance to play their first few regional semifinal games at home in the Galen Center. In a tournament of 64 teams where anything is possible, securing games at home will be crucial.
Home or not, however, the Women of Troy expect to play hard and continue to strive for perfection approaching the season’s final game. Haley and the rest of the team have been set on their goal since the outset of the season; though winning the conference would have been nice, it would be nothing compared to a national championship — a goal that is still very much in reach.
“Right now we have eight matches, we figure,” Haley said. “Two in the regular season and six in the postseason. We want to win every set that we play, That’s what we’re looking for.”
Wednesday’s match will begin in Westwood at 7 p.m., and Friday’s match against Colorado will begin at 2 p.m. in the Galen Center. The match against UCLA will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

Daily Trojan: The Bruins gave up nine sacks to Arizona State on Saturday — what do you chalk that up to?
Emilio Ronquillo: The Sun Devils have a wealth of experienced talent up front, while the Bruins have first-years manning the two guard spots and another freshman at right tackle. The team’s left tackle for most of the game, and a majority of the snaps since Oregon, is an All-Conference lineman … at left guard. Head coach Jim Mora put it best when he described the matchup between 300-plus-lb senior defensive tackle Will Sutton and 280-lb freshman backup center-turned left guard Scott Quessenberry: the Bruin fought as hard as he could, but he was essentially a kid playing against a seasoned veteran that reminds Mora of NFL Hall of Famer Warren Sapp.
On one of the many times Sutton got pressure on quarterback Brett Hundley, he easily swum over Quessenberry to collect his only sack of the game two plays into the fourth quarter. Linebacker Chris Young of ASU brought crucial pressure off of the edge, sacking Hundley on each of the Bruins’ final two drives, with the first forcing the attempt of a missed field goal. Not everything’s on the line, though. Hundley has shown throughout the year that he still can err on the side of holding onto the ball for too long, a habit that Young took advantage of in the red zone.
DT: Like Marqise Lee, UCLA wideout Shaquelle Evans has seen his numbers go down this year. What do you think has caused that?
Ronquillo: The overall numbers don’t flash the way they did last year, but Evans is likely still the receiver Brett Hundley trusts the most. Evans might be the only player we’ve seen Hundley consistently throw to back-shoulder, and if red-zone targets were tracked, the redshirt senior probably has far and away the most shots at scoring short touchdowns as a wideout. In fact, Evans leads the skill positions with eight touchdowns, with five more than he scored all of last season.
The emergence of high school quarterback-turned slot receiver Devin Fuller has a lot to do with Evans’ decreases in catches and yards. A midseason stretch of a couple of weeks, including road games at Stanford and Oregon, saw offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone favor the shorter routes, particularly of the swing variety, to Fuller. Mazzone said at one point that having three true freshmen on the offensive line played a role in shortening the routes. One can distinguish between the roles of Evans and Fuller when looking at their stat lines: Evans has almost 150 more yards than Fuller, who missed last Saturday’s game against Arizona State, on just two more catches. Evans also has twice the amount of receiving touchdowns as Fuller.
DT: What do you consider to be the X-factor of this game?
Ronquillo: Because protecting a quarterback should never be considered something that flies under the radar, I’ll go with the health of cornerback Fabian Moreau being the crucial factor to keep an eye on in this regular season finale. A pulled hamstring took Moreau out of the ASU game for good, and the team had to rotate starting safeties at corner during much of the game to compensate for the loss, with freshman Tahaan Goodman replacing some of those reps at safety. The secondary wasn’t tested too much, as ASU did most of its damage through QB Taylor Kelly or Marion Grice on the ground, with the latter leading the team in catches. No. 1 wideout Jaelen Strong did make up for no other receiver getting more than 20 yards, though. Strong’s 91-yard game included a 19-yard touchdown just before the half saw Goodman slide over just a little too late over the top, and probably would’ve been a back-breaker for most teams. Even if Lee hasn’t been as productive this year, Moreau represents the Bruins’ best shot of making that trend continue.
 
DT: Prediction?
Ronquillo: Count outside linebacker Anthony Barr, cornerback Ishmael Adams and Shaq Evans as guys who really want to win this game. Each of those players suggested that getting mentally ready for USC, even after losing the Pac-12 South, would require no effort whatsoever. About an hour after losing to ASU, Barr even told reporters that he’d instructed any Bruin not hyped up for the rivalry game to pack up his bags and leave the locker room.
Evaluating bounce-back performances for UCLA is tough. The Bruins followed the Stanford loss with a solid first half and poor second act against Oregon and after returning from the loss in Eugene, the Bruins feasted on lowly Colorado. With just a single scheduled game left in the regular season, UCLA has yet to produce that signature win against one of the Pac-12 frontrunners, or a thoroughly dominant performance from top to bottom: Arizona started to run wild in the second half, and Washington kept things interesting even without Keith Price.
On the other hand, USC looks to be a little easier to trust. Since Kiffin was fired, the Trojans have not looked as bad as the Bruins did in that first half last Saturday, and the whole nation knows about that BCS-shaking defeat of Stanford less than two weeks back. Finally, I figure that the team is also all for rewarding Ed Orgeron’s efforts by completing that 7-1 turnaround via avenging Matt Barkley.
If a team wins by more than one score, it’s going to be USC. UCLA’s inconsistency and nightmarish injury situation (the injury bug on the offensive line has now imploded on the backfield, with four out of the five opening-day running backs for the team missed last week’s game) make it vulnerable to a letdown. Provided that a usually stout, playmaking UCLA defense plays to its full potential, Hundley and company may only need one big Myles Jack run and a single huge throw (something that UCLA has produced in 3 of its last four) to keep things tight. Nonetheless, I’m going with the safer team that has already scored its biggest win of the year.
Final score prediction: USC 24, UCLA 20

The USC men’s basketball team looks to extend its four-game winning streak in international territory as it heads to Paradise Island in the Bahamas to compete in the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament during Thanksgiving weekend.

USC will face Villanova on Thursday at 10 a.m. in the first round, followed by a game against either No. 2 Kansas or Wake Forest on Friday.
The Trojans (4-1) concluded a successful 4-0 homestand with a 73-57 win over West Alabama (1-3) shortly after finding out senior guard J.T. Terrell would be ineligible until at least Dec. 18 due to academic reasons. Junior guard Byron Wesley led the way with 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists, continuing his strong start to the season. Freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic added 14 points and six rebounds, while senior center Omar Oraby finished with 13 points, eight rebounds and four blocks.
Wesley leads the team with 19.8 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, while Oraby is averaging 13.6 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.6 blocks per game.
USC entered halftime with a 20-point lead but encountered a slight scare when the Tigers used a bevy of 3-pointers to cut the lead to eight midway through the second half. The Trojans, however, stayed composed and pulled out their fourth straight win.
“We knew the only way they could beat us is from the 3-point line,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “They made 11. I give them a lot of credit. They came in, they had a game plan, they had some very good players and they had very good shooters.”
Villanova (4-0) also extended its winning streak to four games with an 84-80 win over Delaware on Friday. Forward JayVaughn Pinkston led the way with 26 points on 8-of-16 shooting and pulled down five rebounds. Guard James Bell added 16 points and seven rebounds, while guard Darrun Hilliard added 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists.
Pinkston is Villanova’s leading scorer with 20.3 points per game. Bell is averaging 18 points and seven rebounds per game this season, and Hilliard is averaging 14 points, five rebounds and 4.3 assists on the year.
“It’s going to be a very tough one to see how far we’ve come since the start of the season,” Oraby said.
No. 2 Kansas (4-0) looks to continue its momentum after an 88-58 win over Towson on Thursday and a 94-83 win over then-No. 4 Duke earlier in the season. The Jayhawks are led by forward Perry Ellis’s 16.8 points and 7.0 rebounds per game, while freshman sensation Andrew Wiggins is averaging 16.8 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game.
Wake Forest (5-0) ranks No. 2 in the NCAA in rebounds per game and is coming off an 82-54 win on Wednesday over Citadel. Guard Codi Miller-McIntyre leads the team in minutes (31.4 per game), points (18.6 per game) and assists (4.8 per game), while Devin Thomas is averaging 14.4 points per game and leads the team in rebounds per game with 11.6.
The Jayhawks and Demon Deacons will play each other after the conclusion of the Trojans-Wildcats contest.
USC will return to the Galen Center to take on Boston College (2-4) on Dec. 8 at 4 p.m., followed by a match against Cal State Bakersfield (4-1) on Dec. 15 at 7 p.m.

With one week remaining in the regular season, the participants for the 2013 Pac-12 championship game have been determined — and neither the Bruins nor the Trojans made the cut. Stanford and Arizona State will do battle with a berth to the 100th Rose Bowl Game.
Unlike last season, this year’s rendition of the Battle for Los Angeles will have no implications on each team’s Rose Bowl hopes, but that doesn’t mean that the game will lack in meaning. The crosstown showdown between the two schools has ramped up in intensity in recent years, setting up what should be yet another classic matchup in what has been one of college football’s most storied rivalries.
After UCLA’s 38-28 win over USC last season, many fans and analysts saw the Bruins’ reclaiming of the Victory Bell as a changing of the guard. The loss continued the Trojans’ downward spiral that led to a well-publicized 7-6 final record, complete with an alleged post-Sun Bowl brawl and a mass exodus of previously committed recruits, some of whom ended up enrolling at UCLA. Following the defeat, the balance of power had shifted toward Westwood, many believed, and those in powder blue and gold took the opportunity to bask in their newfound success.
“We’re able to compete with them,” UCLA offensive lineman Xavier Su’a-Filo said about USC in the preseason. “We’re able to play them and look forward to that game. Being able to get that win against them last year was great, and it was huge for our program.”
Fairly tame comments, to be sure, but Su’a-Filo’s remarks were indicative that the mystique that USC had accrued after winning 12 out of 13 matchups from 1999 to 2011 had faded. But following the Trojans’ slow start this season that included an embarrassing 10-7 loss at home against Washington State, the chirping from across town heated up.
“Knowing that we’re going to beat them again this year … Especially two years ago when they beat us 50-0. We owe them a little bit,” UCLA wide receiver Shaquelle Evans told ESPN 710 AM in September. “This year, we’re going to try to embarrass them, honestly. They’re struggling, it’s just awesome to see that. I hate them, so I’m just loving it. I’ve always hated them.”
Evans’ comments are part of why the rivalry between USC and UCLA is, in my opinion, the best rivalry in college sports. I realize that the word “best” as it applies to comparing rivalries is extremely subjective, so I’ll do my best to defend this position.
To my knowledge, it’s the only rivalry in which two schools share a city, and I can’t think of any two schools that are closer than the 14 miles that separate USC and UCLA. Unlike other high-profile rivalries, such as Duke-North Carolina in basketball and Auburn-Alabama in football, the rivalry applies to all sports, not just one. The fight for supremacy in Los Angeles is truly a year-round event.
During my lifetime, the rivalry has churned out truly memorable moments, despite being completely one-sided in favor of USC. The Trojans’ 27-0 domination of the Bruins in 2001 heralded the beginning of former USC coach Pete Carroll’s dynasty. In 2005, USC beat UCLA 66-19 in a game that was even more lopsided than the score indicates. The Bruins kept the Trojans from playing in the national championship game in 2006 with a memorable 13-9 win at the Rose Bowl, and as Evans’ comments suggest, few have forgotten USC’s 50-0 dismantling of UCLA in 2011.
Which brings us to this season. As mentioned, nothing will be decided on Saturday except which color the Victory Bell will be painted for the next 365 days, but in a rivalry as storied and intense as this one, that’s really all that needs to be said to pique people’s interest. The game has enough hype around it that it was selected for the primetime 5 p.m. slot on ABC, and as of the writing of this column, the cheapest ticket available for purchase on StubHub was $110. The Coliseum is expected to be sold out for the second consecutive game, ensuring that the atmosphere will be fitting for a game of this magnitude.
In the days leading up to USC’s upset over Stanford, the popular opinion among students was that Stanford, who had defeated USC in four consecutive seasons, was the team that the Trojan faithful really wanted to beat. Many saw the Cardinal as USC’s most-hated rival, an opinion that could be defended by referencing the fans’ storming of the field after the upset was complete.
But as a native Southern Californian who has grown up immersed in the USC-UCLA rivalry, I can say with great confidence that this is not the case. Evans’ comments got a rise out of USC fans, but the reality is that he was simply saying what anyone else would say (if they were being honest). The Trojan Marching Band doesn’t play a song dedicated to insulting Stanford, and I’m guessing that it won’t be adding one anytime soon.
Because if you’re a Trojan, no matter what team USC plays, you’re always ready to chant “UCLA sucks” at the top of your lungs — which is why, no matter the teams’ records, the game will always be meaningful in the Southland.

No. 23 USC and No. 22 UCLA were both eliminated from the Pac-12 race last week when Arizona State defeated the Bruins, but the two crosstown rivals will still duke it out at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday to decide who will claim ownership of the Victory Bell — and bragging rights — for the next year.

The game might have lost some of its luster for outside viewers, but it still carries plenty of significance to the players who will be competing for pride on the field.
“They hate us and we hate them,” freshman safety Su’a Cravens said. “I think them losing [to ASU] is actually gonna make the game even more fired up than it already is just because they’re gonna be thinking it’s redemption time.”
The Trojans will also be looking for some measure of atonement after falling to the Bruins last year to snap a five-game winning streak in the series.
“We couldn’t wait for this game,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “This is definitely a game I’ve had circled on my calendar, especially because they think they’re better than us since they beat us one year.”
Last year, UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley completed 22 of 30 passes for 234 yards and a touchdown in the Bruins’ 38-28 victory. A dual threat out of the backfield, Hundley is averaging 239.7 passing yards (seventh in the Pac-12) and 46.1 rushing yards per game (third among Pac-12 QBs) this season.
“We cannot let Hundley run the ball or throw the ball deep,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said in a media teleconference on Sunday. “We need to be great on coverage and great on our rush.”
But the Bruins might have a hard time protecting Hundley from USC’s vicious front seven, considering they’ve had to employ a patchwork offensive line in recent weeks due to several season-ending injuries. UCLA is expected to start three true freshmen to partially comprise a unit that allowed a whopping nine sacks against Arizona State last week. The Bruins are second-worst in the Pac-12 in sacks allowed (32), only ahead of a young and overmatched Cal team.
In order to avoid USC’s vicious pass rush led by redshirt senior linebacker Devon Kennard (third in the Pac-12 with eight sacks), the Bruins are expected to turn to freshman Myles Jack. Jack, normally a linebacker, has also played tailback for the past three weeks and tallied 265 yards and six touchdowns in the ground game. UCLA coach Jim Mora reported that normal starter Jordon James (5.9 yards/rush, five touchdowns) would probably return for UCLA’s game against Arizona State, but James didn’t end up leaving the sidelines.
The Trojans have their own tailback who’s exploded onto the scene recently in redshirt sophomore tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, who’s tallied 619 all-purpose yards and 10 touchdowns over the past four games. Both Allen and redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler are preparing to receive snaps for the first time in the storied USC-UCLA rivalry.
“There’s big games, and there’s USC-UCLA,” Kessler said. “This week cannot be understated, so we’re excited.”
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee, on the other hand, has played twice against USC’s crosstown rivals and excelled, totaling 22 receptions, 382 receiving yards and three touchdowns. Lee currently has 235 catches in his USC career, 17 short of Robert Woods’ all-time record.
But the Inglewood, Calif. native has suffered a sharp decline in performance during his third season while battling an array of injuries. After winning the Biletnikoff Award as the best receiver in the nation last year (118 receptions, 1,721 receiving yards, 14 touchdowns), Lee only has 44 receptions, 604 receiving yards and two touchdowns this season, and missed his third game of the season against Colorado last week due to a shin injury sustained against Stanford.
There’s speculation, however, that Lee only stayed in Los Angeles to rehab and get healthy for the Battle of Los Angeles.
In a media conference call on Sunday, Orgeron said that Lee would be limited in practice this week but was “sure he’s going to play” against the Bruins.
Like Lee, UCLA wideout Shaquelle Evans has seen his receiving numbers go down in terms of receptions (60 to 42) and yards (877 to 604), and has yet to log a 100-yard game this year despite being the Bruins’ top threat in the passing game. But Evans has stayed healthy and played in every game this season, and after recording three touchdowns last season, he has eight this year.
USC has yet to surrender a special teams touchdown this season but should be wary of UCLA returner Ishmael Adams. The sophomore defensive back earned Pac-12 Special Teams Player of the Week in his first game as the Bruins’ kick/punt returner last week after having kick returns of 58 and 69 yards that led to 10 Bruin points, as well as a 49-yard punt return that lead to a UCLA field goal.
If the Trojans do indeed triumph over their rivals, the prospects for Orgeron to take over the permanent head coaching job will look that much better. But Orgeron has refused to talk about that possibility this week, insisting on focusing on the task at hand.
And his players are having no issue finding motivation to upend UCLA.
“This game is gonna decide whatever bowl game they go to and whatever bowl game we go to,” Cravens said. “It might not be a major [bowl game], but we’re still fighting for pride and we’re still playing to see who the best team in L.A. is.”
And no matter the result, the players are proud of what they’ve accomplished under Orgeron, going 6-1 (6-0 in the Pac-12) since former head coach Lane Kiffin was fired and upsetting rival Stanford for the first time in five years.
“I feel like our team has definitely made a mark on history doing what we’ve done,” Bailey said. “Once [Kiffin] got fired we already had two losses. So it’s been very remarkable what we’ve been able to do under our circumstances.”
It’d be even more remarkable if the team could claim victory one more time.

Before startups were cropping up every second, being a CEO meant that you had years of experience either at your company or within your industry. If your company is in trouble, it’s up to you as the CEO to take the heat from investors and do what’s best for your company. The CEO title is undoubtedly highly sought-after, but with this position also comes an enormous amount of responsibility.
But now, startups — from one-man startups to small teams — give founders or early employees another, perhaps easier, way to label themselves as a CEO.
Michael Jones, the former CEO of Myspace and current CEO of Science.com, has a lot of experience advising and being at the helm of both large and small companies. As someone who knows the pressure and challenges of being a CEO, Jones believes that the title should be differentiated based on role and company culture.
“To do [the title] justice — and to really classify the individuals who use the title — it is probably worth either dividing it into segments relating to the size of the company, or the skill set of the CEO,” Jones said. “For instance, I would consider Rupert Murdoch a classic CEO — more organizationally and financially focused than creatively. Contrary to that, Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs are more product/consumer-minded CEOs — less organizationally focused but much more creative in nature.”
But even with different categories, the people who end up serving as CEOs of the top-performing companies still tend to be somewhat homogeneous.
According to CEO.com, 98 percent of CEOs at these companies are male, 97 percent are married and 99 percent have earned a bachelor’s degree. Approximately 79 percent of these CEOs had the backing of their companies as they were promoted within their company, while 17 percent were hired from the outside and only 4 percent were founders.
Considering the fact that the odds of becoming a CEO at a Fortune 500 are very unlikely for most people in the first place and even more so if you’re a woman or didn’t end up graduating college, the title becomes something even more desirous. Rising to this challenge is the first step, and for many, the chance to beat the odds is what keeps self-starters going.
In her experience creating and founding new platforms, projects and companies since she was an undergraduate student at University of California, Berkeley, Nanxi Liu has accrued an enormous amount of knowledge and experience from her accomplishments. As a student, she built CrimeFighter, an Android app to help report on-campus crime; Nanoly, a biotechnology company that was a recipient of The Dell Social Innovation Awards and had a one-on-one meeting with Steve Wozniak himself.
Currently, Liu is the CEO of Enplug, the first company to build platforms for real-time advertising. Despite the fact that Enplug is not a large corporation (yet), with all of the work that Liu has put into not only her company, but also everything she’s done leading up to this position, it’s safe to say that she has put in as many, if not more, sleepless nights and long days as the next CEO.
For Liu, being CEO is contingent upon your passion for and knowledge of the company.
“At a startup, being CEO means that you are the best sales person in the company,” Liu said. “Being CEO means that you know more about the company than anyone else. Therefore, you can see three steps ahead of anyone else … and use that foresight into making the best decisions.”
But what about people who are CEOs for the wrong reason? Looking back at the statistics, it’s not surprising that the number of people (17 percent) hired from the outside to be CEOs is so low. Sometimes the best CEOs are also the most devoted to the business, even if they might not have years and years of experience.
Josie Baik, a current MBA student at USC and the CEO of cyPOP, an interest-centric social network, served as President of her startup while she was still a student at the University of Washington, but despite the amount of homework or tests she had, she was constantly promoting cyPOP and meeting new people through the company.
Through Twitter, in fact, she’s been able to grow an extremely devoted following. If you’ve ever followed or interacted with Baik through Twitter, chances are that you’ll soon associate her with cyPOP.
“We definitely have people signing up [for cyPOP] from Twitter … half from me and half for cyPOP in general,” Baik said.
Because Baik’s individual efforts and passion for the startup has helped it grow, she has taken on a larger role at cyPOP.
“It was only recently, after a lot of effort, that I and my team felt that I was ready to take on the title of CEO and be truly responsible for executing on my personal vision,” Baik said.
Unlike Baik, however, there are many people who still take on the position just for the prestige. I can’t tell you how many high schoolers I’ve seen proclaim themselves CEO or founder of a blog or a club on campus just for college applications. And sure, the fact that salaries for CEOs of bigger companies are fairly big does not help this case. But if you are ever presented with the opportunity to become CEO only for the title and the money — don’t. Your lack of passion for the company will eventually surface as it did for Tony Hayward, ex-CEO of BP, and many others like him.
But in the end, because a CEO’s responsibilities really depend on how the company is structured and its size, should there be distinctions made in the CEO title? Though the CEOs of Snapchat and IBM are both very busy people, it can go without saying that the latter CEO probably has a lot more to oversee.
“For me, the title has become so watered down, I am not sure what it really means now beyond the fact that someone titled CEO is the operational decision-maker for the company,” Jones said. “Reasonably, I think everyone would benefit from clarity if we gave some sort of leveling to the title — i.e. a first Degree CEO, second Degree CEO — something that indicated the mass of the army the CEO commands, or the enterprise value represented by the CEO’s decision.”
So according to Jones, anyone can have the title. Whether or not it actually means anything, however, is up to the company.

Nice article Sara.  USC afforded me a nice education, but not much about running a company.  I like to think the CEO is the head cheerleader for the company.  The Great Recession was a proving ground for the most capable execs…  Steering a company through hard times is much much more difficult than riding the market or spending easy money.

It’s Thanksgiving. You’ve endured the awkward hugs from your auntie and cousin who went to UCLA, and the constant questions about whether you’ve met a boyfriend or girlfriend. You’ve explained exactly what the startup company you’re about to work for does for the umpteenth time. You made it past the pang of guilt about unwritten cover letters and untouched LSAT books when you find out your cousin passed the bar exam or so-and-so got that big summer internship at Latham & Watkins.
After an interminable amount of awkward conversations and bad advice, you’ve finally made it: Thanksgiving dinner is ready. The glorious repast of massive cooked bird and a host of comforting fall sides await. Belts are pre-loosened and football’s on the television. Your gracious host takes a knife to the breast of the bird and then wiggles the knife a little more. Wait. Your host then saws the knife back and forth and the muscle fibers of the turkey start to shred like meat confetti.
The turkey is an inedible, over-cooked mess. The mashed potatoes are a gummy, flavorless paste. Don’t even get started on the pie: it’s store-bought, which is fine if you’re going to throw it at someone — not fine if it’s served at the biggest meal of the year.
“But it’s not about the food,” your family will say. “It’s about coming together as a family and seeing each other and being thankful.” Sure, it is. But for every leftover-filled night between Thanksgiving and the standing rib roast at Christmas, now is the winter of your discontent.
Dry turkey is a homewrecker, and Thanksgiving with bad food is a recipe for disaster. So don’t be “that” family with the untouched food this Thanksgiving. With a little help from the Daily Trojan staff, maybe everyone can forget about jobs and school and focus on what’s really important during Thanksgiving: the food. OK, and the family, too.
 
BRINING THE TURKEY

Getting a nice, moist bird worthy of a Norman Rockwell painting isn’t as hard as it sounds: sometimes all the turkey needs is a brine. Brining is the process of soaking something in salt water before cooking. The result is a juicier bird that loses a little bit of turkey flavor (“what turkey flavor?” you ask) but leaves a little bit of the flavoring up to the cook, in a way similar to a marinade.
Brining requires a few things: a large container and fridge to hold that container, a turkey that hasn’t been pre-salted, a lot of water, salt, brining ingredients and time. You’ll need to prepare the brine anywhere from 6 hours to a night ahead of time. Also, you won’t be able to make stuffing in the turkey cavity, so prepare it separately. This brine needs to be prepared early on the day before Thanksgiving, so that it can be cool before nighttime (when you’ll brine it overnight).
Turkey Brine (overnight brine for a thawed, 14-17 lb turkey):
 
Base:
 
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup salt (for less time, use more salt, up to a full cup for a 6 hour brine)
1 gallon of ice water
1 gallon of chicken stock
 
Other ingredients to consider: garlic, herbs, spices, halved lemons. Bear in mind each of these flavors will make it into the turkey.
 
Instructions:
 
1. Boil stock, sugar and salt in a large pot until the ingredients dissolve. Immediately bring to room temperature, then refrigerate or cool.
2. Pour ingredients into brining container along with the gallon of iced water, and then put the turkey with the cavity facing down or breast side down (that’s the part that needs to be brined the most) in the container.
3. Cover and brine overnight.
 
When preparing the turkey on the big day, don’t forget to pat the skin of the turkey down: this ensures that the skin gets crispy and browns evenly. Stuff the turkey cavity with aromatics such as apples, lemons, onions or whatever tickles your fancy and matches the flavors of the brine. This ensures that the turkey upholds its structural integrity and cooks evenly.
The rest is up to you. Good luck. With a turkey this delicious, you’re sure to be on the road to getting some compliments of your own this Thanksgiving.
Side Dishes

What’s turkey without delicious sides? Don’t give your guests the bird — dress that turkey up with some hearty side dishes.
 
Euno and Evan’s Mac and Cheese
 
A certain Daily Trojan Lifestyle Editor’s little brother once requested that he have macaroni and cheese at Thanksgiving. Without going into detail, the result was referred to in his family as “The Mac and Cheese Incident of 2011.” So a certain Daily Trojan Lifestyle Editor hit up the kitchen with his best friend and worked hard on a new formula for a winning macaroni and cheese. Here’s what they came up with:
 
Ingredients:
 
1 16 oz. box of elbow macaroni
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups milk (room temperature)
1 cup heavy cream (room temperature)
3 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese (aged white cheddar, if you can)
2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 bay leaf
1 egg
Dash of paprika
Salt and pepper for seasoning
1 cup Japanese panko bread crumbs
 
Instructions:
 
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Begin cooking the pasta according to package instructions (to al dente).
3. In a tall-walled saucepan or pot, make the roux: melt the butter over medium low heat and slowly whisk in the flour (shake the flour very slowly and whisk into the melted butter).
4. Turn up the heat on the roux to medium and keep whisking until the mixture becomes a nutty, cappuccino brown.
5. Turn the heat down to medium. Stir in the bay leaf, paprika, milk and heavy cream and keep stirring for about ten minutes, or until it takes on a thicker consistency. Stir for all ten minutes and attend to the pot constantly.
6. Break the egg, whisk it in a separate bowl. Stir in most of the cheese (leave a little of each cheese for the topping) and add the egg. Keep stirring — the pot should now have a very velvety cheese sauce.
7. Stir in the cooked macaroni, making sure to cover all of it. Pour the contents out into a baking pan and top with extra cheese. Top this with a layer of breadcrumbs and put the pan into the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until breadcrumbs brown.
8. Remove the pan (be careful, it’s hot) and let cool for 7 to 10 minutes before serving — this gives the cheese time to reset.
 
Hearty Autumn Medley
 
Daily Trojan columnist Sara Clayton shares her recipe for a Hearty Autumn Medley. It’s a hearty, red meat-free side that’s easy to make and invokes all the flavors of fall.
 
Ingredients:
 
1 yam
1 sweet potato
1 russet potato
1 honey crisp apple
1 large red onion
2 chicken sausages (I use Trader Joe’s Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage)
Italian herbs (i.e. basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme)
 
Instructions:
 
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Cut up the yam, sweet potato, russet potato and honey crisp apple into 1-inch cubes. Put finished potatoes and apples into a bowl.
3. Cut red onion up into 1/2-inch slices.
4. Pull out casserole dish (or something similar) and put in potatoes, apples and sliced red onions.
5. Give the mixture a couple of splashes of olive oil — enough to cover mixture, but avoid soaking.
6. Sprinkle Italian herbs onto mixture and mix everything together.
7. Take out chicken sausages and nestle them in mixture.
8. Put casserole dish into oven.
9. After 25 minutes, take out casserole dish and cut sausages into 1-inch coins. Mix the sausage into rest of medley and put back into oven for another 15 to 20 minutes.
 
Warm Apple Cobbler
 
Daily Trojan food writer Alegra Hueso shares her recipe for warm apple cobbler. Who needs store-bought pie when you can use fresh apples (which are in season) to create this phenomenal cobbler? Best of all, making it should be a piece of cake — or easy as pie.
Ingredients:
4 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices (about 5 1/2 cups)
3 large Fuji apples, peeled, cored, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices (about 4 cups)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup (packed) golden brown sugar
2 tablespoons all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
 
For the topping:
1 stick of butter
2 large eggs
2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/3 cups sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
Vanilla ice cream
 
Instructions:
 
The apples:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Butter a 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish.
3. Toss first five ingredients in large bowl. Add sugar, flour and cinnamon; toss to combine.
4. Transfer to baking dish.
 
The topping:
1. Whisk butter and eggs in medium bowl until smooth.
2. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and ginger in large bowl.
3. Form well in center of flour mixture and add butter mixture. Using a rubber spatula, toss until large clumps form.
4. Using your fingertips, break up clumps into smaller pieces and sprinkle topping over apples.
5. Bake until apple mixture is bubbling and streusel is golden brown, 50 to 55 minutes.
6. Cool slightly. Serve cobbler slightly warm topped with vanilla ice cream.

There’s a lot at stake for Sriracha, the popular hot sauce brand that brings that extra fiery zest to chow mein, soup and hamburgers.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
Huy Fong Foods, one of the most popular brands of sriracha, is currently at risk of shutdown after the city of Irwindale recently sued the company for alleged noxious fumes. Despite the severity of residential complaints, the entire matter is unworthy of being brought to court until more thorough investigations are conducted.
According to the Los Angeles Times, following 37 complaints from 18 households, the city of Irwindale sued Huy Fong Foods on Oct. 28 for emissions from the production of its hot sauces that allegedly cause residents to “cough, gag and complain of inflamed respiratory conditions.” The city’s earlier request for a temporary restraining order was denied on Oct. 31, and just last Friday, the ruling for the case was delayed — just as expected.
Mere health complaints by residents should not be the only evidence backing a city’s lawsuit against the company. The heartburn, headaches and bloody noses that have been reported in court documents sound severe, but not scientifically verified. A couple of inspections have confirmed the smells, according the Los Angeles Times, but it is not enough to track the odor back to the facility.
According to the Times, air sampling devices have been installed at the factory and through the neighborhood to find more proof — but to no avail, apparently. Spokesman Sam Atwood of the South Coast Air Quality Management District told the Times that data from the monitoring devices were extremely limited, and a sample from the factory contained ethyl acetate, a compound commonly emitted during food and beer production. The concentration found in the factory, however, was several thousand times below harmful levels. To trivialize the matter further, South Coast Air Quality Management District, an agency notorious for declaring odors public nuisances, has not yet found fault with the sriracha plant.
The city should not have taken such drastic measures before conducting a real investigation and obtaining real evidence. Not only does the suit seem uncalled for due to the blatant lack of evidence, but a possible shutdown would shake many fans of the hot sauce.
With an exotic flavor that has given the sauce almost rock star status among condiments, Huy Fong’s Sriracha is certainly deserving of its own food festival. According to the Wall Street Journal, Sriracha was virtually unknown five years ago, but today’s number of products that contain the hot sauce is more than twice the number in 2012, a rare doubling according to Lynn Dornblaser, a market researcher at Mintel Group who spoke to the Wall Street Journal. The company has made sriracha famous in the United States through its own unique version of the sauce.
Considering the shortage effects to businesses on a global scale, more investigation definitely needs to be done before calling this a case. So far, no reports have been made on the composition of the exhausts. There need to be investigations on the time of day the emissions are strongest, which could lead to a solution to the odors if the process could be run at night to minimize discomfort. And more importantly, there needs to be a follow-up by the South Coast Air Quality Management District on whether this counts as a real issue of airborne irritants or just a stench people dislike. That distinction makes a world of difference.
For now, the fate of Huy Fong Food’s delicious, profitable sriracha sauce hangs by a thread.

So the city of Irwindale has no problems with the poor air quality from the Irwindale Speedway or the MillerCoors brewing factory located in the same city? Interesting
Maybe you should read a bit on nuisance law before discussing what is essentially a nuisance law case. What are the legal issues involved? Lazy journalism, even for a columnist
Should the airborne compounds actually be shown to be the cause of the respiratory distress experienced by the local residents, what should be the next step? If the smells were produced by something other than a food product, what method would be required to provide relief for those in the vicinity?
I do not want businesses to be unduly penalized or restricted, but air quality is an important quality of life issue, particularly for those most directly impacted, even if it is only a “stench” that people do not like. Hot sauce fans should be able to be get their supply needs met without causing residents of the surrounding community to suffer because of it.

It’s that time of year again: Thanksgiving. As many students attempt to cram in final study sessions, their minds are really on the suitcases they need to pack for their flights home. But some won’t be going home this Thanksgiving and it’s important for USC to acknowledge this group who might not be able to afford a plane ticket or those students who live too far away.
Though President C.L. Max Nikias hosts an annual dinner for those students who don’t have the luxury of going home, the event has an attendance limit and can’t accommodate all the students who remain on campus for the break.
USC must implement more activities and offer better programming during this Thanksgiving break period. One method is to implement activities similar to the alternative break options offered during the winter and spring breaks. These alternative break programs would offer students who haven’t previously been exposed to the L.A. area the chance to explore and experience the extent of the cultures represented. Or for those who are looking for something a bit more adventurous, leadership and team-building programs could be another option, giving students access to a kind of education they can’t get in the classroom.
Students could learn things such as first-aid and survival tactics, and then get the chance to practice them on a camping outing. And for those who prefer not to get dirty and fight off spiders in their sleep, USC could offer small classes similar to Welcome Week, in which students can try a few different topics that spark their curiosity outside of their majors, without the commitment of a full semester class. For example, professors in departments such as psychology could teach a session on one specific question studied in the major course or the School of Cinematic Arts could teach a session on green screens. Students could even have access to extra tutoring in a class they’re struggling in. If students are feeling the urge to give back, USC could arrange community service projects for a few days, such as working at a soup kitchen on Thanksgiving or cleaning up beaches.
Other students or Resident Advisors who will remain in town could lead these activities, which could be anything from group field trips to locations throughout Los Angeles, to ski or community service trips.
Regardless of the programming, those who will stay at USC for the break should also realize the advantage they have in comparison to those who leave for the holiday. Though these students won’t get to see their families or friends from home, they can use this time to prepare for the last week of classes and take their finals by storm. They won’t be plagued with stress due to all the work they neglected in favor of their loved ones because they would have — presumably — already completed it.
Even better? For those students staying in the dorms, there’ll be a unique environment of silence. Enjoy this rare event while it lasts, and live it to its fullest: Blast music, run around, wander and bond with new people out of a shared lack of travel. Hike to the Hollywood sign. Scavenge the thrift shops of Los Feliz for hidden gems. Follow the Hollywood Walk of Fame from start to finish. Eat at a restaurant in every international neighborhood of the city. Watch the sunset at the Santa Monica pier, and maybe even sneak in that last beach day. Go Black Friday shopping without having to leave your family at the table. Or if you just want a break for break’s sake, simply hang around and do nothing, because that’s always nice, too.
In the end, non-breakers really do matter, and though there are plenty of options for the economically advantaged, the majority of students would highly benefit from an increase of university-offered programs during Thanksgiving break.

Why is it that young adults today feel as though they are entitled to constant entertainment?  I am a current Masters of Social Work grad student and USC undergrad alum.  Our Thanksgiving break was even shorter than 5 days it was 3. There were students who stayed on campus that long weekend.  Airfares were more expensive than they are today.  Yes we had a large number of foreign students too.
There were no cell phones, play stations or laptops to keep us entertained.  Our phone calls home were at a pay phone and if we were lucky our families would accept a collect home. We did not have a rail line with metrolink as a mode of transportation.  Yes there was black-Friday shopping but stores were closed on Thanksgiving.   
So what did we do? We created our own adventure.  We made friends, studied or relaxed.  We were more social.  One of the reasons we were was because we did not walk around campus with our focus on a smart phone screen or mini ipad.  We did not isolate ourselves from others by wearing headphones.  We actually communicated without saying a word.  
Life after undergrad is not easy.  No one is going to be there to entertain.  We ourselves create our own individual happiness.  Try for one week to leave the phone in the backpack and take off the headphones.  There is a world out there to explore, but I am afraid the young are missing it.  Yes the advancements in technology are wonderful but I am afraid they also took away some basic social skills.
Hi Abigail:  Elated that Dad sent me your recent writing on Thanksgiving, we enjoyed your
perspective!  Have a blessed Thanksgiving with your friends, love & hugs,Auntie & Uncle in Florida
So, the faculty and staff of the University don’t deserve a break to spend the holiday with their families?  I think we can fend for ourselves for a few days…
It’s because USC has lots of international students. Not every culture celebrates thanksgiving.
Good points in the article. Mainly would help freshman, as some may not have made strong enough social connections to be invited to a friends home. Even implementing a few could make a difference.
It’s 5 days off. Get over yourself.
Only communists don’t celebrate Thanksgiving
I realize you were attempting to make a joke, but just because someone celebrates Thanksgiving doesn’t mean they can go home for it every year.
