We’ve compiled some tips to stay informed about the presidential election as the race to the White House begins. Flickr/Creative Commons
All college students should strive to be informed about news on all the 2016 presidential candidates. Knowing the candidates and understanding their campaigns generates voters who can make informed decisions. However, this objective information can be difficult for college students to access.
Social media sites and applications are powerful sources in providing news on the upcoming election. However, finding sites and applications that have easily digestible information, and supply data accessible to students can be difficult to find. Here are a number of platforms to explore before casting your vote:
  Re-tweet me, if you want to reach me
Twitter generates many users who can follow candidates short, one-hundred and forty word count posts. These short posts follow the presidential campaigns and summarize any major information. In 2015, Twitter bought the recently launched application Periscope, which is a video live streaming application. Through Periscope, political candidates can broadcast live video and post it directly to Twitter.
  Reddit, Pinterest and Spotify
 Reddit is a surprisingly effective platform when learning about your desired candidate and where they stand on different topics. For example, Barack Obama hosted chats on Reddit for his 2012 campaign. Candidates are also utilizing social media to attract young voters through means that are less politically motivated. Democratic candidate hopeful Hillary Clinton has made her own Spotify playlist, and her Pinterest page shows images of women who inspire her. While this may not inform voters of specific policies candidates plan to enact, it will help them get to know the candidates. 
“Extra! Extra! Read all about it!”
The News application, downloaded onto all iPhones, allows users to pick content from a variety of newspapers, magazines and websites, store preferred news publications and save articles. Whether it is the Washington Post, Business Insider, The New York Times, or the Los Angeles Times, reading from a variety of sources allows for you to remain an objectively informed voter.
My (Presidential) Story
Snapchat has quickly transformed into a platform where voters can stayed informed about presidential candidates during their campaign. For example, Snapchat users upload videos and images of the Republican and Democratic debates. Candidates will also often make guest appearances and give short statements about certain topical issues, or what they will discuss at an upcoming debate.
The Online Encyclopedia of Politics
Ballotpedia is a search engine and encyclopedia that offers unbiased data on politics at the local, state and federal level. The site provides information on candidates’ policy and campaign issues, and major election results from previous campaigns.  
Are you a blue state or a red state?
270toWin is a newly designed, recently updated application for the iPad. It has an interactive map that illustrates the 2016 election forecast, and whether the state will elect a Democratic or Republican President.
These applications and websites create virtual platforms and spaces for discussion. In a world influenced by technology, social media has become a powerful platform for candidates address their voters.

“What are you going to do with an English major?”
“English major? I haven’t heard that one in a while.”
“Wow, an English major. That’s a bold choice.”
Any student who is “bold” enough to choose to major in the English language knows the trials and tribulations that these quotes encapsulate. These are the struggles that constantly plague humanities majors, while classmates boast about their future jobs lined up at the accounting office, or how far they know their engineering major will take them in life.
After browsing classes for next semester such as “English Literature Since 1800,” “Writing Narrative and Romanticism in Literature and Language,” I curiously flipped to courses like chemistry, forensics and macroeconomics, debating if those might somehow serve me better in the long run.
The humanities have always been regarded as the “lesser” subjects to some extent, battling in a duel against physics, biochemistry and calculus for the title of most successful career path.
People always see students taking STEM courses walking away with the gold medals around their necks, striding toward their large offices and five-figure salaries, leaving us humanity folks waiting tables at the 24-hour diner, writing screenplays in our spare time.
With the economy more competitive than ever before (yes, even as an English major I am still aware of our country’s current economic status), the need to “get a good job” right out of college has become dire, leading so many students sprinting toward more focused areas like business and engineering.  
English and other arts and sciences majors are often viewed as humanities hippies who can’t tell a polynomial from a Pythagorean function. So many people have the preconceived notion that all you have to do to pass an English course is bullsh*t your way through the words.
But an English major is about close reading, analysis and communication. There is no bullsh*tting involved, my friend.
In my first semester at USC, in course for my English major I have learned more about the world and the human condition than I could ever imagine. I have learned about the alienation in a modernist world from T.S. Eliot’s “The Wasteland.” I have learned the suppression of the female voice through texts like “Trifles” and the poetry of Emily Dickinson. I have learned the inherent racism ingrained in this country and the unheard voices of a working class through a text like “Christ In Concrete.” 
You may be thinking, “That’s all fine and dandy, but what are you going to do what that in the real world? Where is reading poems and writing prose going to take you?” Reading a wide variety of texts has given me a solid grip on the past, an intention to focus on the present and a keen eye towards what the future may hold.
A major in biology may be useful if you want to be a doctor, and business and accounting may make you the big bucks, but the value of communication in this world is irreplaceable. If you’re a businessman who doesn’t know how to communicate with your future enterprise, you just lost a big deal. If you’re a lawyer who doesn’t know how to write a good brief, you’re out of a job.
So for the countless number of random relatives, old teachers and family friends who may be out to criticize your humanities degree, know that we have the power of words on our side. And words have the ability to shape and transform anything within reach. Plus, when are you ever going to need to know the names of the microcells in a plant leaf, or the area, perimeter and volume of a can of soup?
This post has been revised. 
“People always see students taking STEM courses walking away with the gold medals around their necks, striding toward their large offices and five-figure salaries, leaving us humanity folks with a cushy job at the local Starbucks, writing screenplays in our spare time.”
-not true. Most STEM students struggle academically. The average engineering GPA is like 2.6 from what I remember. Bad GPA = lesser chance of landing intern or job at some blue chip tech firm; but good GPA isn’t a guarantee either. Not everyone who declares bio-chem (pre med) as a major makes it to med school. It’s not as rosy as you think. 
Succinctly put, STEM and non-STEM majors are screwed in this job market, for the most part. Don’t forget that a lot of tech firms EXPLOIT H1B visa holders, and business/accounting is overly saturated (too few positions for myriad applicants).

No need to worry about cooking all day if you host a potluck dinner. Flickr/CreativeCommons
Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and with the brisk wind and chilly temperatures this past week, things are starting to feel festive. One way to cut through the monotony of the days before break is by organizing a pre-Turkey Day dinner with your friends. Though the thought of cooking up a Thanksgiving feast might seem overwhelming, there are plenty of stress-free ways to celebrate the holiday. Here are a few tips and tricks to make your “Friendsgiving” both stress-free and unforgettable.  
Potluck Style:
No college student has the time or energy to spend hours in the kitchen preparing an elaborate meal. Instead, organize a family-style potluck dinner, and have a few people bring main courses and side dishes and another few bring dessert. That way, you’ll have a Thanksgiving-worthy meal without any of the hassle.
White Elephant:
This twist on Secret Santa is both easy to organize, and tons of fun. Have everyone bring a present (make sure you set a price cap), and wrap it up so that it’s impossible to tell what’s inside. Put all the presents in the center of the room and then let people decide if they want to pick an unopened present or “steal” one that someone has already unwrapped. This game is especially entertaining when silly presents like a jar of peanut butter or a bottle of shampoo are mixed in. 
Goodie Bags:
Have each person write his or her name on a brown paper bag and line all the bags up against the wall. Keep a few stacks of pens and paper lying around, and write little notes to slip into people’s bags throughout the night. Afterward, everyone gets to take home their bag and open up their notes. They’re often both sweet and unexpected, and make the evening that much more memorable. 
Hot Chocolate and a Movie:
For those of you who want to keep things really simple, this is the way to go. After dinner, make some hot chocolate and add all the whipped cream and marshmallows you’d like over the top. Then pick out your favorite movie and hit the couch for a few hours. At this point in the semester, you deserve it.
Downtown Dinner:
 If you don’t have a kitchen or don’t like to cook, L.A. is the place to be. You can find everything from Korean Barbecue to Italian comfort food within just a few miles, and many of restaurants are conveniently located close to Metro stops. I recommend heading out a few hours before you plan to eat so that you get a chance to explore and experience the unique culture of the “City of Angels.”
Here at USC, many of us have been lucky enough to find some lifelong friends. Take some time to celebrate with them, and show them how much you appreciate and value their company. Happy Friendsgiving!

Tradition · Facilities Management Services duct-taped Tommy Trojan in anticipation of the annual rivalry week between USC and UCLA. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
Tommy Watch has officially begun in anticipation of rivalry week with UCLA. The Trojan Knights, an all-male spirit and service organization, will uphold their annual tradition of safeguarding Tommy Trojan and other USC statues 24/7 until the game against UCLA Saturday.
Drew Halderman, rally and recruitment chair for the Knights, explained that this tradition dates back to the ’30s, when both schools would frequently pull pranks on each other. Today, however, it has evolved into a spirited and light-hearted occasion to bring the whole USC community together.
“Tommy Watch is our favorite time of the year because we get everyone excited and amped up before the rivalry game,” Halderman said. “Friends and classmates always love coming by Tommy Trojan and just hanging out with us while we maintain our 24-hour watch.”
Last week, Tommy and Traveler, the University’s official mascot, were both wrapped in duct tape by Facilities Management Services. USC’s previous canine mascot, George Tirebiter, was also given personal protection with his very own doghouse.
“I love that USC takes the security of our beloved mascots and symbols very seriously,” said Jennifer Kim, a senior majoring in health and humanity. “You might think we’re going too far with all this protection, but trust me, UCLA is probably doing the same thing.”
Kim has friends at UCLA who can attest that their school is taking similar measures to protect the Bruin Bear. In the past few years, the bear statue has been tucked away in a secure wooden box, which costs UCLA approximately $5,000. The university also spent $15,000 on security cameras.
These precautions, however, did not stop a group of USC fans from spraying red paint on the Bruin Bear last year. The pranksters took action early — a full nine days before the rivalry game — and were able to successfully spray “SC Runs LA” across the bear.
According to Knights President Will Orr, there have not been many significant incidents of vandalism by UCLA fans since he has joined the organization, but there are always some suspicious Bruins who come to campus as part of their “pledge mission.”
“Every year, we’ll have a group of pledges hanging around Tommy, and they’ll claim to be from a USC fraternity that doesn’t even exist,” Orr said. “You can never be too careful, so we’ll definitely stay on watch for that.”
The Knights are so serious about protecting Tommy Trojan that they plan on extending their 24-hour vigil even during Thanksgiving.
“We’ll set up folding chairs and sleeping bags for the whole week and next Thursday. Some of us will probably eat our Thanksgiving dinners right next to Tommy,” Orr said.
Nevertheless, Tommy Watch is a fun time for the Knights every year. Brendan Nguyen, who joined the spirit organization last fall, says his favorite part is being right in the middle of all the excitement and hype on campus.
“It’s a fun experience because I get to hang out with my fellow Knights as well as other students who stop by and show their support,” Nguyen said. “I’ve never seen so much school spirit and unity as I have during Troy Week.”
Other spirit activities during the week include Conquest, a pep rally, concert and fireworks show, which will be held on Monday. Artists Miguel and ILoveMakonnen will perform at this year’s concert.

Crosstown showdown · More than 2,000 runners participated in the We Run the City 5K, which took place Sunday in Exposition Park. – Photo courtesy of Stephanie Hernández
USC and UCLA partnered up to hold the fourth annual We Run the City 5K on Sunday in Exposition Park to help raise money for the Special Olympics.
Participants pledged money in order to run for either USC or UCLA, and the school that raised the most money was declared the winner. According to Luke Farnell, manager of LETR and Special Events for the Special Olympics, this allowed fans of both schools that weren’t necessarily affiliated with either school to feel like a part of the rivalry.
“They pick the team that they pledge their allegiance to.  So there are fans, alumni, faculty and students,“ Farnell said. “The cool thing about it is for some of us that didn’t go to either school, it’s a good way for us to finally put on that cardinal and gold jersey or that blue and gold jersey. It’s our way to represent our passion at that moment.”
According to the official event website, USC had 1,091 runners and raised $66,884 in comparison to UCLA, which raised $50,084 and had 1,034 runners. USC raised 55 percent of the money, while UCLA raised 45 percent. Patrick Macias, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, was proud of the USC turnout for the event.
“There was a big turnout of USC students,“ Macias said. “A lot of red and gold was represented at the event. It was great to see so many different organizations coming out, all to support a great cause.”
The event was mostly staffed by volunteers from student groups from local high schools, as well as students from both USC and UCLA. Paola Lopez-Cordon, a senior at Helen Bernstein High School, decided to participate because she thought it was amazing to see fans of both schools come together for a greater cause.
“I was online one day looking for volunteer opportunities, and I came across this one,” she said. ”It interested me because I know how big the rivalry is. It’s really cool to see both rivals get together and just come together for one event.”
Anthony Tran, a junior at Azusa High School, decided to volunteer because he wanted to be a part of the energetic environment that the event fostered.
“What made me want to get involved with this event was just looking at people’s faces while they run and getting hyped up with all of the fun stuff that we do,” Tran said.
This year the event was held at Exposition Park, but the event’s location switches between USC and UCLA each year. Macias suggested that having the event happen at a neutral site in the future might make the competition more even.
“Last year it was at UCLA; this year it [is] at USC,” Macias said. “But the group that wins is always the group that hosts. So I think that the location greatly affects who wins. Maybe if there was a more neutral location it would be more even.”
However, this did not prevent UCLA students from participating in full force. Lauri Label, a sophomore at UCLA majoring in psychology, said that running in the 5K made her more excited for the game Saturday.
“I wanted to run the 5K because it was a really good cause for the Special Olympics,” Label said. “We wanted to beat USC, and it was getting us pumped for the game on Saturday. It was just a really good experience.”
Label also felt that participating in the 5K made her feel more involved in the rivalry between the two schools.
“It was just a cool thing to know that we were participating in the rivalry a little bit, and it was cool to know that we were representing our school,” Label said.

Active listening · Manuk Avedikyan indexes survivors’ audio visual testomonies from the Armenian Genocide for the Shoah Foudation. – Photo courtesy of Manuk Avedikyan
Though Shoah means “Holocaust” in Hebrew, Manuk Avedikyan is working to document  survivor accounts of the Armenian Genocide for the USC Shoah Foundation, which has an agreement with the Armenian Film Foundation to preserve and disseminate these testimonies.
The USC Shoah Foundation dedicates itself to documenting audio visual testimonies from survivors and witnesses of genocides throughout history. It contains nearly 53,000 testimonies in 39 languages and is conducted in 63 different countries.
“An Armenian’s identity is inevitably tied to the Armenian Genocide,” Avedikyan said.
Avedikyan’s grandparents survived the systematic extermination of the Armenian minority in what is now Turkey. The Ottoman Turks killed around 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1923 with the express purpose of ending their collective existence.
His current job came unexpectedly after speaking to Hrag Yedalian, a program administrator at the Shoah Foundation. Avedikyan wished to enter local politics at the time. However, when Hrag mentioned he was looking for an indexer for the Armenian Genocide, Avedikyan could not resist as he had been surrounded with this topic throughout his life.
Even though the genocide happened before he was born, Avedikyan said it’s affected him in many ways.
“I have been surrounded by the topic of the Armenian Genocide through so many aspects of my life; from my grandparents as survivors, to my Armenian school, my Armenian history, my parents being raised in Turkey, lectures I’ve attended in Los Angeles since my teenage years and my college education,” Avedikyan said.
Avedikyan, along with Yedalian and Visual History Archive curator Crispin Brooks, assigns keywords to each minute of testimony using the Shoah Foundation’s 63,000 keyword thesaurus. He is mainly involved in indexing English, Armenian and Turkish testimonies.
Avedikyan said the testimonies add depth to history.
“Many of the testimonies are impactful in different ways,” Avedikyan said. “Some due to their eloquent and unique historic details and others due to the emotion and extremely sad story.”
Avedikyan described a testimony from an Armenian from Chomaklu (near Kayseri, Turkey) who was forced to march all the way to Jordan, an uncommon occurrence. Though some villages did “host” his caravan, they were essentially left to die.
The Armenian’s recount of throwing his dead mother down a well is especially haunting. Death was so rampant around him that he did not even think twice about his action at that moment but regretted it years later in an orphanage in Jerusalem.
“Another testimony gives light to the attempted arrest of Armenian resistance fighter ‘Murad of Sepastia’ in Govdun [now Göydün], Sivas [Province] by Ottoman forces from the eyes of his sister, an incident likely not known to many historians,” Avedikyan narrated. “She later discusses her forced march and escape in the Mesopotamian desert.”
The third testimony describes a survivor’s escape with his father and brother from Kurdish bandits and lords to the mountains of Mu. Later, he avenged his father’s murder when he was captured a second time to serve as a peasant.
Avedikyan said that each testimony tells the story of the Armenian Genocide from a different perspective.
“Though these are just three out of nearly 400 testimonies, they shed light on unique historical realities and experiences that are rarely looked into or understood like escapes, orphanage life, Islamic conversion, life as a peasant under a Kurdish or Turkish landlord,” Avedikyan said.
This is the first time that a significantly large collection of audio visual testimonies of the Armenian Genocide are going to be presented for the wider public’s educational use. This collection also gives researchers the opportunity to ask questions about the often overlooked period of modern history that may not have been previously addressed and have them answered.
“This collection is important for the USC Shoah Foundation as we continue to expand to experiences other than the Holocaust,” Avedikyan said. “The Armenian Genocide collection is the second largest in size behind the Holocaust and ahead of the Cambodia, Nanjing and Rwanda collections.”
Avedikyan majored in history with a focus on the Middle East  at California State University, Northridge. He also received his master’s in political science and international affairs at American University of Armenia in Yerevan, Armenia, writing a dissertation about the Justice and Development Party reforms toward non-Muslim minorities in Turkey.
Avedikyan’s knowledge continues to expand as he indexes the hundreds of survivor testimonies, relating them to his family’s history and travels in Turkey and Armenia.

Postseason success · Junior defender Kayla Mills and the Women of Troy became just the third USC team to make the NCAA Sweet 16. – Matthew Park | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team saw its season come to a conclusion on Sunday after a 2-0 loss to Virginia in the Sweet 16 of NCAA Tournament.
The team traveled to Charlottesville to first take on Princeton in a second-round matchup Friday, meaning there was no guarantee of playing  Sunday. USC defeated Princeton 3-0 and dominated the Tigers in every phase of the game.
USC put in a complete performance against the Ivy League champs: three goals, a clean sheet and the lion’s share of the possession.
Sydney Sladek opened the scoring on 12 minutes, and USC never looked back. Morgan Andrews bagged a double, sealing a 3-0 win and a Sweet 16 berth.
The win meant the Women of Troy were on to the Round of 16 for the third time in program history. Sunday’s fixture, however, brought a whole new set of challenges.
Virginia is the No. 1 team in the land and thus had the privilege of playing USC on home turf. The Women of Troy were riding a wave of momentum heading into the game, but so too were the Cavaliers.
In a competitive match with plenty of defense, USC had some impressive spells of possession and managed to put the top-ranked Cavaliers on their heels for much of the afternoon.
Virginia forward Makenzy Doniak, a California native, scored on the stroke of halftime to give the home side the lead heading into the break. The Women of Troy ensured that UVA did not seize the momentum in the second half, though, as they knocked the ball around nicely and kept Doniak and company quiet.
The USC defense stood tall, defending set pieces well and getting yet another strong performance out of goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme.
After excellent buildup play, however, Virginia’s Alexis Shaffer received the ball at the top of the box and hit a lovely curler past Prudhomme. It was an inch-perfect strike from the midfielder, and for USC, it signified the end of the season.
With that said, the Women of Troy restricted UVA’s explosive players and could certainly have walked away from Charlottesville with the win. USC challenged Virginia netminder Morgan Stearns on a handful of occasions, including early on when junior midfielder Morgan Andrews let one rip from outside the area but sent the shot high.
“We try to get those shots off as early and as often as we can,” Andrews said.
In fact, the Women of Troy fired 45 shots in the first two tourney games combined. Virginia’s talented defense limited USC’s shot total on Sunday to just 10, a meager number by USC’s lofty standards.
Andrews and fellow midfielders Mandy Freeman and Nicole Molen were a handful for UVA, as were the wingers for the Women of Troy like Savannah Levin, Reilly Parker and Sydney Sladek.
From the outset, USC matched UVA’s speed and technical ability.
The Cavaliers’ midfielders also found themselves chasing whenever USC’s midfield trio got the possession game going.
This really was a championship caliber match that just happened to take place in the third round.
Though the loss to Virginia was agonizing for USC players and fans, the Women of Troy enjoyed a terrific season, posting a 16-6-1 record and not losing a single game on their home turf. Next season, head coach Keidane McAlpine returns a talented core group of players, including Andrews and junior defender Kayla Mills, who hope to make another deep run in the NCAA Tournament.

Nothing has been more emblematic of the current state of the Trojan football program than Saturday’s exercise in futility against the Oregon Ducks. In yet another game, the Trojans were thoroughly outcoached, yet by sheer force of raw talent still had a semblance of a chance going into the fourth quarter. That is the Trojan football program right now, incredibly mismanaged yet somehow still in contention.
That is what makes being a fan of USC so frustrating right now. No matter how many things go wrong — awful coaching hires and terrible defensive schematics come to mind — there is always hope that things can be better. That was the Oregon game in a nutshell: Defensive players were getting burned left and right, the offense was shooting itself in the foot, and still at the start of the fourth quarter the Trojans were driving with a chance to cut the deficit to three points.
It’s unfortunate that this is a reoccurring theme against quality opponents. Whether it has been Stanford, Notre Dame or Oregon this year, the Trojans have had the raw goods to make it happen but lack the requisite coaching and polish to come out victorious.
There were issues in every facet of the game, but just take the defense, for example. I’m not sure what scheme defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox was running in the first half, but whatever it was it should be enshrined in the hall of fame of ineptitude. I have never seen opposing offensive players so wide open. It was as if Oregon would have had more trouble scoring if they were running an 11 on 0 practice drill.
The worry all year has been what will happen when Wilcox faces a solid quarterback. That question was answered Saturday as Vernon Adams, who is good but no Marcus Mariota, looked like the second coming of John Elway out there. Though to be honest, I’m sure the local Oregon high school quarterback would have looked just as good against the absolutely abysmal coverages that Wilcox was throwing out there. How he still has a job, and one that compensates him so handsomely, is beyond me.
Even with that catastrophic first half, the Trojans were able to put together three straight stops on Oregon in the third quarter when they started blitzing Adams. It’s not like pressuring the quarterback is reinventing the wheel, but it seems that Wilcox is scared of this concept. No one is going to stop the Oregon offense, but USC showed it could at least bottle it up by dialing up the pressure.
That’s the USC football program in a nutshell. The simplest solutions, like blitzing the quarterback or hiring a coach with a history of winning and not mediocrity, are right there, yet the program continues to defy logic and make inane choices.
The Trojans are like a Fortune 500 company that is past its heyday but continues to seek out management and practices from the past. The program has so many resources and so much raw potential, that all it takes is one good CEO or coach to right the ship. They need a coach who will out scheme opponents and take the time to develop the highly touted recruits who come to USC.
Outside of the few players whose talent is so immense that they will be first round picks regardless of who is coaching, the majority of Trojan athletes have not developed to their full potential. The coaching staff has been a categorical failure in this regard. USC may have had higher rated recruits than Oregon, but the players who stepped on the field for the Ducks were superior because they have been coached and developed.
For most players, there is very little progress and development in their time as Trojans. That is simply unacceptable. Players should not be face guarding, biting on play action and missing blocking assignments this late in the season. That should have been fixed in training camp or in non-conference play.
The combination of this stagnant growth and major deficiencies in coaching are the reasons the Trojans often lose to quality opponents. A good coach fixes all of that. USC has stayed somewhat relevant and decently competitive in the face of sanctions. That is over, but the Trojans now face a more pernicious and pervasive threat: internal mismanagement. The program cannot afford another bad hire.
With all of the turbulence and turmoil the last few years, USC has still managed to be decent and that is the root of frustration for most fans. We all see how great the program can be, if given the chance. The team is so close with poor coaching, it seems obvious that with a great leader they will be tremendous.
It’s frustrating that the Athletics Department didn’t get this memo two years ago, and that has set the program back. Let’s hope they rectify that with a big name hire, or the exercise in frustration and aggravation will continue unabated. Fortune 500 companies who compound mistakes with even greater ones wither out and die. The program is far from such dire straits but one or two more terrible hires like Sark, and the Trojan program will be a downtrodden one, full of false hope and glory days that continue to get farther and farther away.
It’s time for a clean break from the past to build the program up to what it could and should be. That means cutting all ties with the Carroll era and finding the next coach to not build on the old, but create an entirely new dynasty: one with more “we did,” rather than “we could have.”

There is something exhilarating and peculiar about listening to electronic music — it is a genre molded out of technology, through the use of synthesizers and electronic instruments. When performed live, the final product provides a stimulating experience that intoxicates listeners, which is exactly what Big Data and RAC, or the Remix Art Collective, did at their performance Friday night at Club Nokia.
The Friday lineup of openers included Karl Kling, a former member of RAC; Filous, an 18-year-old Austrian remix artist; and Geographer, an American indie rock band. These artists set the mood in Club Nokia, an intimate, 2,300-seat concert venue.
The high-energy music being played in such a small-scale venue allowed for greater surround sound and a truly galvanizing experience.
Big Data, an American electronic music project produced by Alan Wilkis, set the stage with computerized data simulations, giving the impression that the performers were robots themselves. This was supplemented by synchronized dancing by lead singers Alan Wilkis and Liz Ryan. Big Data performed their hit song, “Dangerous” featuring American indie rock band Joywave twice — opening with the Oliver Remix and closing with the original version.
Vivid graphics were played as the backdrop to accompany their eccentric style — specifically with “Get Some Freedom,” displaying America’s Uncle Sam pointing his finger at the audience and the depiction of other political innuendos. The song, as stated by Big Data on Facebook, talks about technology as a tyrannical dictator,  supposedly affording freedom to his people “as a means to control and enslave them.”
Big Data’s music and what they represent can be described as a paradox — they criticize and express distrust in technology, yet their music style and structure relies heavily on synthesizers and is computer-based. This reinforces the idea that technology is inescapable, as humans have become addicted to it.
It was clear who the audience really came to see as the ground level of Club Nokia reached its brim by the time RAC opened with their upbeat remix of Joywave’s “Tongues” featuring Kopps.
RAC is solo indie-electronic project of André Allen Anjos. They are an ever-changing group of artists who reinterpret and remix songs by other artists. During their performance, the group switched singers four times for certain songs in accordance to varying vocal styles for each song.
The crowd erupted with approval during their remixes of familiar songs such as Two Door Cinema Club’s “Something Good Can Work” and the ODESZA cover of “Say My Name.”
There was a guest appearance by Chelsea Lanks, an American electro-pop musician, who sang RAC’s remix of “Can’t Forget You,” from RAC’s newest album, Master Spy, released in September.
RAC also performed top hits from last year, such as “Hollywood,” featuring electro-pop Penguin Prison, “Let Go,” featuring indie-rock Kele, indietronica MNDR and “Tear You Down,” featuring indie rock musician Alex Ebert, which had more electronic-pop undertones than their newer album.
The energy of the room, dancing and wave of glow sticks in the air accompanied the powerful and heart-racing music well. In fact, one of the group members made an appearance by running through the crowd and building up excitement.
Both Big Data and RAC had exhilarating performances — each with their own style of electronic composition. LED lights displayed in arrays of lines crossing framed RAC, accompanied by sporadic spotlights that matched beats with the songs.
The theatrics of this concert and the passion with which the artists performed is what made this concert an overall success. With the advent of technology, electronic music is a product of this growing generation.

Many people who have been reading my columns so far have posed the question, “Why EDM?” Admittedly, I have come to expect the condescending looks I get when I explain my love for the electronic dance music genre. Especially when I was a young girl, people were continually confused as to why I am interested in the genre, how I got started and how I know so much about it.
I have to say this with a bit of bitterness, but I have also been assumed to be one of those drugged-out valley girl “raver” types in the context of an ignorant musical perspective. Sometimes when you say you like EDM as a female, people are very quick to label you as an airhead who wants to experience the “rave life” and has had a little bit of a rebellious streak.
This is usually the moment when I interject and begin to exhibit my hold on the rhetoric of not only the EDM world but also of the music industry. People then become very confused. Most individuals, if they have any knowledge of EDM, have never seen a girl able to spout out a detailed narrative of the history, construction, meaning and culture behind electronic dance music.
But I am not and have never been a DJ. So at that point I am assumed just a fan. I have come to understand that labeling me into a singular vision of what an EDM fan is has become an easy task for those who don’t understand my passion and vision for my future in the music industry.
As a brief history of my own discovery and journey through EDM, I have to start at my freshman year of high school. I have somehow always known that the music industry was what I wanted to go into. I was a singer and guitar player but had come to realize that my musical vision was more expansive than a singular narrative of one individual. I wanted to discover people and music and then use my talents and knowledge of the industry to present that to the world.
My discovery of EDM happened in a way that was relatively abrupt and impressive. I was walking out of school one day and ran into the boy I liked. Yes, I know it’s terribly cliché, but he asked me in passing if I was going to the Avicii concert. I stupidly realized I had no idea what an “Avicii” was, if it was a band or a person or a robot.
I ran home to look up who Avicii was so next time this boy and I talked I wouldn’t look so uncultured. Keeping in mind that Avicii wasn’t so disastrously mainstream six years ago, I searched every musical platform to find out what and who he was.
What I found was surprising in many ways. There is something about EDM that is inherently primal, hopeful, angsty and beautiful all at the same time. After listening to a few Avicii tracks such as “Levels” and “Street Dancer,” I realized I had discovered something totally magnificent and unheard of in my sheltered mind. As a musician, I was floored. I continually searched more and more artists that came up when I frantically googled “EDM artists” to see who else could give me that strange feeling of elation and anticipation.
So after my initial period of complete assimilation into the EDM music world, it became quite difficult to expand my knowledge of the holistic experience of EDM. For a few years, I was too young to go to festivals like EDC or Ultra, and in Arizona, the very few EDM artists that performed were always at clubs and other 21-plus venues. So I patiently waited, gathering more and more information about the world I wanted to completely immerse myself in.
I started to understand, alongside my general growth in the knowledge of the music industry, just how revolutionary this genre was. It didn’t just appeal to me on a fan level, but as someone who wanted to work in the industry someday, I recognized the potential for continual evolution that electronic music has.
When I finally attended my first EDC the summer after I turned 18, I was absolutely addicted. Not only was I finally able to explore the musical world that so fashioned me into discovering the industry from a new perspective, but I came to know and understand the very particular culture that presents itself in the EDM world. I learned all about the compassion and friendship that “ravers” and festival goers have for each other. I remember distinctly my parents being terrified of me going. Afterward, all I could say was how shocked I was at how nice the people were.
In the world of EDM, besides the music and technicalities, there is a paradigm of social progressiveness that has really never been seen before in any other cultural group. I was immersed in an environment where no one cared about my parents’ money, what high school I went to or my SAT score. No one cared about my sexual identity or my racial background. People just wanted to share this full body musical experience with me.
So nowadays when people ask my why I love EDM, I tell them this story. In my hopeful future career in the music industry, I will be able to continue to pursue my passion for the genre that continues to amaze me.

The USC Thornton Opera presented the second performance of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s opera-seria La Clemenza di Tito Friday.  The production was held in Bing Theatre.
La Clemenza di Tito is an ambitious undertaking, especially for singers still in their collegiate studies, as the opera contains some of Mozart’s most demanding vocal music. Set in 79 A.D. within the Roman Empire, the plot centers around the fictional assassination attempt of Emperor Titus — changed to the Italian spelling Tito in Caterino Mazzola’s libretto — plotted by the noblewoman Vitellia and carried out by the patrician Sesto, under Vitellia’s seductions and manipulations. True to the motifs of opera-seria, which deals with subject matter that involves characters of noble antiquity, the show toys with themes of love, desire, betrayal and revenge.
All principal roles were sung by graduate students within the Thornton School of Music’s Vocal Arts program, which, when considering the difficulty of the score and the enormous amount of stamina that is required of the singers, is already an accomplishment in itself. Brent McMunn, conductor and resident music director of the USC Thornton Opera, was able to attain the tricky Mozartean precision required of his musicians. In the program notes, McMunn stated, “Large spans of secco recitative, speech-like scenes accompanied by keyboard, alternate with a series of virtuoso arias … Using contemporary subject matter, [Mozart develops] far more complex musical forms and ensembles.”
Resident stage director Ken Cazan did a fine job directing the young singers, though his staging was not as risqué as one would normally come to expect or hope from his productions. Cazan, who worked double duty as the show’s principal set designer as well, opted to omit major set pieces for visual projections, a notoriously hit-or-miss technique which worked well in this case, as the images were tastefully executed — with the discernible exception of the unintentionally comical “fall of Rome” at the end of Act I that drew untimely laughter from the audience.
Furthermore, there were some continuity errors between the set and costumes; the projections displayed images of antiquated Rome, though the singers were garbed in costumes that looked very much inspired by 18th-century French rococo. And though the costumes were glamorously achieved and exquisitely tailored by resident costume designer Jacqueline Saint Anne, they seemed far more Versailles than Vesuvius.
Regardless of the historical confusion present in this production’s aesthetics, the performance was superbly sung, particularly by mezzo-soprano Katie Beck as Sesto. Beck, a second-year master’s student, was terrific, performing with all the fervent valor required of the betrayed patrician. She possesses a Federica von Stade-like shimmer to her voice that is balanced with solid technique and florid musicality. All in all, it was a first-class interpretation.
Other standouts include soprano Yelena Dyachek, who made a malevolent Vitellia — though she was created to look like Marie Antoinette, thanks to Saint Anne’s opulent costuming. Dyachek, who made headlines earlier this month after her triumphant win at the Western Region’s Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, has a voice that is both delicate and forceful, and lends itself well to Mozart. She is certainly en route to a successful career.
Tenor Hui Jin tackled the role of Tito with faultless technique without sacrificing any of the sweetness in his tone. Mezzo-soprano Lesley Baird was an ardent Annio and was paired nicely with soprano Laura Smolik, who sang a dulcet-toned Servilia. Baritone Nick Martorano, as Publio, sang with a well-placed voice that carried easily over the orchestra.
More information regarding future performances and productions by the USC Thornton Opera can be found online.

Last Thursday, Breeze Bikeshare unveiled 500 bright green bikes on racks around Santa Monica and Venice, with plans to expand to other areas in the future. Using a kiosk system, the program allows customers to pay for their journey, returning the bike to a station after use. Though the concept has been met with much upheaval and backlash, it is essential to support this system in Los Angeles, where car exhaust fumes contribute to the city’s poor air quality.
It’s no surprise that city bike sharing programs have taken over urban areas in the last decade, becoming an attraction in more than 400 cities across the nation. Accessibility and affordability have helped promote the concept. For users of Breeze Bikeshare, a plethora of stations are scattered along almost every street in Santa Monica, providing an alternative form of transportation for $6 an hour to those wanting to leave the congested traffic. Additionally, bike sharing programs can be more appealing for tourists, as they would be free from the hassle of multiple bus transfers and escalating taxi fares. And, of course, the environment would benefit from a bit less smog.
The negative effect on the environment is perhaps the most serious issue that comes from the congestion of cars in the city. For many years, Los Angeles has consistently topped the list for most polluted cities in the world. The current atmosphere in the city has affected weather patterns and air quality. But the most staggering consequence is more deadly. According to the Wall Street Journal, researchers have linked traffic fumes to the obliteration of memory cells and the development of fatal heart disease. Given the amount of people who sit in traffic every day, many commuters put themselves at continued risk.
Knowing this, bike share programs can serve as a gateway to pollution reduction. In an effort to diminish the effects of climate change, Nice Ride bike share system projected that its presence along the Mississippi River in Minnesota would eliminate 34,383 annual motorized vehicle trips. That means carbon monoxide emissions would be reduced by 36.78 pounds per day, along with the aversion of harmful hydrocarbons and other chemicals. Translated into terms relative to Los Angeles, where there is a larger target population and effect size, the positive consequences of a bike share program would be greatly amplified.
Naysayers might question the practicality and safety of a bike share program, but previous success achieved by hundreds of cities point to Los Angeles finally moving in the right direction. Exhaust from vehicles has caused the air quality to deteriorate and people’s health to suffer. Ironically, to the rest of the nation, Southern California embodies the image of absolute health and environmental awareness. With Breeze Bikeshare, Los Angeles can finally live up to that reputation.

When the first large-scale bike share in Los Angeles was unveiled a little over a week ago, environmentalists rejoiced at the opportunity for the city to finally lower the burdens for bike use in the city and hope to relieve some of the overwhelming traffic congestion that has come to define the area. And though Breeze Bikeshare seems like an innovative solution to the massive public policy problem that is Los Angeles’ over-reliance on cars, it is smart to remain skeptical about whether this new program will be used enough to render it a significant change to transportation in Los Angeles.
Technical issues with the bike share program, for one, could pose a serious obstacle to its overall success. As the Metro publicizes its own independent bike share program, Breeze Bikeshare could conflict with the Metro’s bike share infrastructure. Two simultaneously running bike share programs in the city would just add more expensive confusion into the chaotic mess that public transit in Los Angeles already is. So without a cohesive, unified program, a promise to finally integrate bike share into the fabric of Los Angeles life will remain unfulfilled — especially considering the annoyingly stubborn affinity that Angelenos have for their cars.
Given its recently unveiled — and highly contested — transit plan, which significantly increases bike lanes around the city at the expense of car lanes, Los Angeles is trying to rebrand itself as a more bike-friendly city. And that’s commendable. But even more room on the road and bike share programs might not be enough to convince people to ditch their cars for bike rentals. More truly large-scale infrastructure changes — for example, repaving L.A. roads and making biking safer in certain parts of the city — are necessary before biking as a form of transportation can be widespread.
Moreover, planners also have to take extra steps to ensure that their program caters to an audience that will use it. USC students, for example, are unlikely to use bike share, since so many Trojans have bikes already, and they overwhelmingly prefer other methods of transportation for longer distances away from campus. For those that drive to work, biking — or a combination of biking and using public transit — must be both more economical and faster than driving for them to shift to using bike share on a daily basis.
Bike share has the capacity to truly revolutionize transit in Los Angeles. But policymakers have to take a critical look at whether they’re fixing the problems at hand rather than enlisting a tech startup to be the cure-all of an incredibly complex and unsustainable transportation system that currently pervades Southern California.
Despite our perpetually blue skies, disturbingly sandy beaches and iconic lush palm trees, Los Angeles is still the nation’s smoggiest city. It’s time to applaud the city’s attempt to change that. But as citizens, we should also watch closely to what comes next. It could be either the next stage in Los Angeles’s evolution to a sustainable city — or it could be an unmitigated disaster.

I really expect more from someone studying at Price. I realize this is writing to SC students but bike share isn’t exclusive for SC students in fact its a first/last mile strategy to allow for people who either don’t have a bike or don’t want to carry a bike with them on the metro. It would be foolish to think that a bike share system will be the “revolutionary” change in transportation for Los Angeles, its a piece of the greater transportation system, which enables more trips by bike. I’m hoping you actually read the Metro staff report on the Metro  bike share system and how and why they are creating their system and who it is geared towards, the membership and rate structuring etc. Also Breeze bike is a Santa Monica bike share program not a City of Los Angeles program which should have been called out in the article. 
There’s far more to say about this but its just disappointing that a price student, granted an undergrad, would write something without bringing in sources or numbers from other systems as a comparison such as NYC, Boston or DC. They wouldn’t detail the differences in the systems or their managers etc.
This editorial is pretty confused.
>But even more room on the road and bike share programs might not be
enough to convince people to ditch their cars for bike rentals. More
truly large-scale infrastructure changes — for example, repaving L.A.
roads and making biking safer in certain parts of the city — are
necessary before biking as a form of transportation can be widespread.
So before we give more room to bikes, biking must become safer. Except giving more room to bikes is what makes biking safer (along with other tools).
>For those that drive to work, biking — or a combination of biking and
using public transit — must be both more economical and faster than
driving for them to shift to using bike share on a daily basis.
Evidence? People trade convenience, speed and cost for one another; biking doesn’t have to be better in all dimensions to win converts. A ride that’s a little longer but more pleasant and affordable may suffice to sway people.
>Bike share has the capacity to truly revolutionize transit in Los
Angeles. But policymakers have to take a critical look at whether
they’re fixing the problems at hand rather than enlisting a tech startup
 to be the cure-all of an incredibly complex and unsustainable
transportation system that currently pervades Southern California.
The only person saying that bikeshare alone has the capacity to revolutionize LA transit is you. Even bikeshare’s biggest backers don’t think bikeshare alone will cause sweeping changes – it’s only in concert with other policies that major progress can be had.
>Two simultaneously running bike share programs in the city would just
add more expensive confusion into the chaotic mess that public transit
in Los Angeles already is. 
The bikes aren’t suited for taking across the city; this problem is more imaginary than real. Plus, solutions exist – there could be ‘bridge’ stations with docks for both systems, in places in the middle, like Culver City and West LA.

The USC men’s basketball team weathered a late second half push by the New Mexico Lobos to hang on for a 90-82 win at the Galen Center Saturday night.
The Lobos trimmed a 20-point second-half deficit to as little as five with a minute and a half remaining. But the Trojans forced six consecutive misses by New Mexico and took an 87-79 lead with under a minute to play. Up six points in the dying seconds, USC’s Katin Reinhardt blocked a three-point attempt by Elijah Brown to seal the victory.
“The ball was sticking,” junior guard Julian Jacobs said on the second-half letdown. “We didn’t have much ball movement. We weren’t rebounding too well. We were just missing shots. We weren’t making the extra passes we did in the first half. We weren’t putting pressure on the defense.”
Four players scored in the double digits for the Trojans, with Jordan McLaughlin’s 19 points leading the way. Elijah Stewart had 18 points, Bennie Boatwright had 15 and Jacobs added 14.
Up 17 points at halftime, the Trojans didn’t let up to start the second half. A 6-2 run out of the gate put them up by 19. USC went up by 20 at 66-46 midway through the half after an impressive block by Chimezie Metu resulted in an open three for Reinhardt on the other end.
But an 11-0 run by New Mexico cut the lead to 74-64 and helped make the final score a little more respectable for the opposing team.
The Trojans have now started the season 3-0, the first time they’ve done so since the 2000-2001 season, but head coach Andy Enfield has thought little of it.
“The teams we’re playing are very good,” he said. “We need to continue to get better. It’s a nice statistic. I’m happy to be 3-0. We have a lot of things to work on.”
The game started with the teams going back and forth. Boatwright hit two threes, the latter of which came in transition to give the Trojans a 10-8 lead.
The Trojans then went on a 13-2 midway through the first half. It was ignited by a pair of finishes inside by Metu — a putback dunk and a layup plus the foul. A fancy dribbling display and finish by McLaughlin and a jumper by Nikola Jovanovic put USC ahead 23-14 with 8:17 to play in the first half.
Metu, the tall, imposing freshman, had eight points, five rebounds and five blocks in 20 minutes.
“His shot-blocking ability is as good as I’ve seen, especially for a freshman,” Enfield said. “He had great timing, he was explosive. That’s what we were missing last year.”
In turn, Metu feels “very” comfortable in his short time thus far at USC.
“Ever since I got here, everybody’s been helpful — all the players and coaching staff,” he said. “That’s one of the main reasons I came here. I felt like this was a great environment for me to grow as a player and a person.”
USC extended its lead to 17 at halftime with help from the three-point line. Stewart was a perfect 4-of-4 and the team shot 7-of-13 from beyond the arc in the first half. His fourth three-pointer gave the Trojans a 42-26 lead with under four minutes remaining.
Stewart was also fouled at the end of the first half shooting a three, and his free throws sent USC to halftime with a 48-31 advantage.
The Trojans were able to push the ball in transition, recording 18 fast break points to just five for New Mexico. Enfield noted it was a product of strong defensive play.
“We’re shot blocking, stealing the ball and playing good defense, and that leads to transition baskets,” he said. “You can’t be a good transition offensive team without being a good defensive team.”
USC shot 50.9 percent from the field and 48 percent from three-point range in an efficient offensive night. Enfield pointed to McLaughlin’s 19 points, which came on just seven shots.
“That’s hard to do,” the coach said. “That’s terrific offensive efficiency. Our whole team is doing that now and that’s why we’re putting up a lot of points.”
The Trojans are averaging 91 points per game three games into the season. They wrap up a four-game homestand to start the year against Cal State University, Northridge on Monday night, and then will head to Orlando to play in the AdvoCare Invitational during Thanksgiving weekend.

“Just to let you guys know, there was some sort of terrorist attack or shooting in Paris, and I’m fine.”
This was the status update through which I found out about the Paris attacks. I was sitting in the lobby of my hostel in London, attempting to harness Wi-Fi Friday night when suddenly a flurry of statuses from 10-15 of my study abroad friends visiting Paris that weekend popped up through my newsfeed. They were statuses telling stories of trauma, verifying safety and pleading for prayer.
The next few hours were filled with worried check-ins, catastrophic television images and preliminary news articles. Over the next day, the situation would continue to develop as the rest of the world became aware of the senseless tragedy that had taken place. I flew back to Bilbao early Sunday morning carrying a mixture of confusion and sadness in my heart.
I felt lucky to have decided to experience the magic of Paris earlier on in the semester, and my status as a study abroad student in Spain had allowed me to do so with ease. Yet, I think that being in Europe at the time of the attacks caused me to be affected differently than I would have been if I were home at USC.
Not only do I receive the American end of the conversation through social media and communication with my parents and friends, but Bilbao’s physical proximity to Paris has also created an added layer of discussion, as well as anxiety.
My mom has told me that she would prefer that I stop all my travels for the rest of the semester. My host mom has told me that she plans on canceling her holiday travel plans and staying put, and she recommended I do the same. We turn on the television during every meal to be greeted by new developments, proposed strategies by members of the European Union, or newscasts showing clips of propagandistic videos created by the Islamic State. “Locos,” sighs my host mom. “Crazies.”
I have had moments where I’ve felt a bit overwhelmed. I’ve felt fear that such radicalism could exist, organized and well-funded and powerful enough to commit such a massacre, without an end near in sight.     
But fear is precisely what ISIS operates on, and feeds off of. Fear is the exact
mechanism through which terrorists seek control.
As important dialogues about Euro-centric media coverage unfold, including proper responses towards terrorism (read: not Islamophobia), and empathy toward refugees, it’s essential to keep educating ourselves. It’s not easy. I myself have a lot of difficulty fully understanding the complexities of the Islamic State, while also thinking about effective ways to balance security with humanitarian aid. I have great difficulty thinking of concrete ways to help.
But I think it’s of the utmost importance to keep trying. After all, complacency, ignorance and fear are the forces that foundationally keep terrorism and prejudice alive. This is not the time for divisiveness.
This is the time for compassion. This is the time for bravery. This is the time for solidarity against an attack on humanity, because je suis Paris. We are all Paris.
