With spring semester almost halfway through, the hustle and bustle of everyday life is bound to wear down our bodies. There is a simple fix that we should all be incorporating into our daily routines. Napping.
Though it seems hard, napping, is one of the greatest things you can do for your body to revitalize and reenergize yourself throughout a long day. Growing up, it was incredibly easy because naptime was already programmed right into our lives. Wake up, go to preschool, color, snack time, play with blocks, nap, lunch, do a puzzle, watch Barney, go home. What a life, right? The pre-school teachers knew what was up, but just because it isn’t set into our schedule any more doesn’t mean that it isn’t necessary.
According to The New York Times, studies are finding that an afternoon nap can significantly increase mental alertness and improve mood, particularly in the large number of people who sleep too little at night (a.k.a. overworked college students like ourselves). Because we are so on the go, our bodies might develop a tolerance to how much sleep we need. We have become cruel to our sleep cycle as we test and program our bodies to be able to function on as little amount of sleep as we can get away with, so that we have more time during the day. When we do this, though, our bodies go into an almost autopilot mode. At times, we go through our routines without even realizing what were doing. This lack of sleep can really take someone away from all there is to enjoy in life and deters them away from mindfully enjoying the present.
To become a pro at napping we must learn how to take time for ourselves — turning off the trivial communication and closing your eyes seems easy, but some spend 20 minutes on Instagram first rather then closing their eyes. Instead of trying to find that perfect filter, search for the perfectly soft blanket. To take a good, quality nap, find a quiet area. It doesn’t have to be your bedroom — just somewhere you feel at ease and relaxed.
Naps provide different benefits depending on how long they are. A short nap for even 15 to 20 minutes can enhance your alertness, concentration, mood and coordination. A 90-minute nap will get you into slow wave and REM sleep, which enhances our creativity. If you sleep deeply and uninterruptedly the entire time, you’ll go through a full 90-minute sleep cycle, and make up for sleep you might not have gotten the night before. Usually a 90-minute nap is a good amount to make me feel reenergized. I find that anything longer makes me just want to sleep for the rest of the day.
According to BBC Health, the most natural time to take a nap, based on our circadian rhythms, is in the afternoon — sometime between 2 and 4 p.m. Napping too close to your bedtime can make it harder to fall asleep at night. If you have late class then this is the perfect between class break. If you end class around this time, use it as a chance to reenergize your brain before opening up your homework. A little change can go a long way.

On Tuesday, I sat on a bench in Ueno Park, sipping on a “Caramelly Sakura Latte” from Starbucks (delicious!) and watching dusk settle on the bare branches around me. I had spent the day at the Ueno no Mori Museum of Art, wandering the halls of 「日本の美術」 or “The Art of Japan.” The exhibition had also been a competition of sorts, and upon entering the gallery, I was handed a survey asking me to choose my favorite work and explain why. Suggested judging criteria, spanning from the technical skill and imagination of the artist to the rhythm and expression of the painting, were listed one after another. I made a face at the questions, which were completely in Japanese, and exchanged a wry smile with my friend.
“Well, let’s jump in,” I said.
Walking into an exhibition titled “The Art of Japan,” one might expect to see nothing more than traditional pieces — scrolls and ukiyoe prints hanging off white plaster walls, Chinese characters splashed out in black ink. There were indeed a few of those — watercolor pieces inspired by famous Japanese shrines and temples; colorful scenes from the classical Japanese novel, The Tale of Genji; and ikebana, or flower-arrangements, laid out on white blocks in the middle of the room.
But, of course, the world of Japan is far more vivid than that. Western-styled works also crowded the gallery, fingers interlaced with their more traditional counterparts. A crayon piece by 平松恵子 (most likely read as Hiramatsu Eiko), titled 「手の平の海」 (The Ocean in the Palm of a Hand) caught my eye. It was a portrait of a young, freckled boy cupping a small puddle of water in his hands, from which two whales, etched out in rainbow from the black crayon backdrop, were leaping into the air. Beside it, 「六花の勇者」(The Hero of Snow) by 宮城 (most likely read as Miyagi) depicted a young warrior leaning against a tree. The leather-clad body and black, futuristic rifle of the character, coupled with the manga-like style of the artist, made her look like a character out of a Japanese video game.
Most pieces, I realized, were actually a fusion of Western and Eastern styles. Ikebana arrangements featured miniature white picket fences side-by-side with its flowers; graceful geisha in kimono were done in oil, in homage to European portraiture. Finally, I came to a piece titled 「絆」 (Bonds) by MIEKO. It was a painting of the Virgin Mary, standing before white-capped peak which could only be identified as Mount Fuji. Looking at these two great icons of East and West, of nature and religion, of beauty and faith, I felt that it was for moments like these that I decided to study abroad.

There’s something really endearing and weird that really cracks me up when I see pictures of unsuspecting animals wearing clothing. Snakes with hats. Baby goats with sweaters. Mice with glasses. I clearly spend too much time during lectures perusing Google Images for my own amusement. The sheer absurdity of the pictures keeps me coming back.
Growing up, we often denounce people and things that are different than us, even if it isn’t intentional. Those who differ from the given “norm” are often considered outcasts, or at the very least, strange. And although we are also taught to value diversity, whether it is with respect to culture and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexuality, differences in personality, or even with things as miniscule as clothing choice, we are never told how. Accepting and appreciating differences in others is something we develop over time, and there is no better setting for this than college.
USC is attractive to many students for a variety of different reasons; some enjoy the idea of a large international population, the promising of a diversified and thorough academic curriculum, the wide range of clubs and organizations, or perhaps the intense school spirit and strong Greek life. My large East Coast high school sent five of us to USC this year, and together, we represent the Dornsife College of Arts and Sciences, the Marshall School of Business and the School of Cinematic Arts. Though most of us weren’t particularly close in high school, the experience of traveling 3,000 miles away for college has brought us all together. The differences we might have seen in each other during our high school years are void and irrelevant. And despite the variety of our interests and personalities, we see one another as a part of the same collective community that had been somewhat lacking.
Upon coming to college in the fall, the huge notion of diversity that had been emphasized in every tour and pamphlet was not apparent to me. It took me over a semester to realize the only thing stopping me from meeting people from different backgrounds and communities was myself: I had subconsciously associated myself with and befriended people who were both similar to me and largely from the East Coast, even from the same state. I involved myself with similar activities I did back home. The only things that had changed in my life were the academics.
In high school, we are often very self-conscious about how others think about and perceive us. It can be hard to initially move past that mentality. But now that I’ve settled into college, I want to do something absurd, even if it’s only crazy to me. Maybe this is my freshman naiveté kicking in, or maybe it’s the beginning of a post-high school rebellion.
I haven’t thought of anything in particular that I want to do, but perhaps it’s better that way. Open-mindedness and spontaneity are virtues I should learn to embrace. Until then, let me know if you have any weird things I should Google search.
