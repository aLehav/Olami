I remember, when I was a little kid, I lived for stories: the bedtime stories with heroes, damsels, whimsical glamour and endless magic.
My mom used to reprimand me for staying up late with her large book in my lap, reading and dreaming. That book was so large I could have sat in it, and I often did. I nestled myself in its pages when no one was looking — laid it on my floor and wrapped myself in the letters, the words, the pictures, the creases. That book was so large I used to think it held the world.
But that’s the thing about stories. I took them as truth, as fact, as secrets and narratives written for me, to me, about the greater world — but my mom told me over and over again that stories were just stories, just make-believe. She insisted that little boys did not fly on broomsticks, that big, friendly giants did not collect dreams in jars and that chocolate factories could never make girls into blueberries.
When I read these stories, however, I did not think about logistics or the impossibility of such accounts. I remembered how I felt when I closed the cover: the insatiability of a character’s journey, the descriptions of times and places I would never experience but nevertheless had, in a way, through the eyes, ears, fingers, nose and taste buds of miscellaneous characters.
This summer, something extraordinary happened. I traveled to a place I had read about years and years ago. To jumpstart my backpacking trip after several weeks in Madrid, I found myself first in Pamplona, Spain, running with the bulls. Immediately afterward, with my heart still pounding and my feet still thrumming with the echo of hooves on cobblestone streets, I took a stroll on a beach in San Sebastian.
And with each first step into these unfamiliar territories, I thought the same thing to myself: Ernest Hemingway was right.
In the fifth grade, I read his novel The Sun Also Rises. I remembered the vivid descriptions of a city crazed with extravagant celebration and spewing wine, a city blanketed in white and red. I remembered the calm, soothing air of San Sebastian — the description that Hemingway gave to one of his most beloved sites of serenity. It was déjà vu, even in a place that felt my footsteps for the very first time.
I remember my uncle used to tell me that life is like a book. There are chapters, cliffhangers, unresolved conflicts and heartache. There are footnotes, parentheses, prologues and, sometimes, an epilogue. I asked him — where am I?
You’re still in the first chapter, he told me. You’ve got a long way to go.
For weeks afterward, I dwelled on this potential metaphor. Anything can happen in a book. I could turn into a blueberry, fly a broomstick or even collect dreams in jars with a big, friendly giant. And, like in life, whatever occurs is written down, preserved in ink — unchangeable, irresolvable.
So maybe he has a point: The paradoxical constraints and limitless possibilities of life are represented in the very text of a book.
Let’s talk about real life. I am taking the LSAT Saturday. More than a handful of my friends are taking the MCAT in the spring. Friends are graduating, getting married, having children, traveling the world and experiencing true loss for the first time.
Suddenly, it seems that the world is shifting — for me, for all of us. I feel like I am on the cusp of some great change, some whirlwind moment that will dictate how the rest of my life — the rest of my novel — will go.
Years ago, I played dress-up and pretended I was an adult. I know you did too. We imagined where we would be, who we would become — we placed our dreams beneath our pillows every morning and every night; when our heads laid back down upon that soft recluse, we rediscovered all the whimsical fantasies we had saved.
Where you end up going, where we all end up going, will be sudden and chaotic. There will be sudden bends in the roads that take us in directions we never anticipated — but every success, every small triumph, will still tremble with a hint of familiarity.
It will be déjà vu — because we have all pondered on these moments, we have all seen its brief horizons — and I’m sure, when we imagine the glory of dreams fulfilled, the joy that first began with that first burst of hope will somehow find its way to us, no matter how far we have come or how many pages we have turned along the way.

Jason Reitman is a suitably quirky man, one who clearly matches up with the movies he makes.
The director behind Juno and the upcoming Up in the Air walks with confidence, speaks with rapid-fire sarcasm and obsessively documents everything on his iPhone.
Master shot · Academy Award-nominated director and USC alumnus Jason Reitman (pictured above, right, with George Clooney), follows his 2007 hit Juno with Up in the Air, a dramedy starring Clooney and Anna Kendrick. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures 
Taking pictures of all the unkempt journalists at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, prepared to quiz him on his latest film, he slyly promised, “I’m going to cut out your face and put it on photos of naked ladies.”
Up in the Air is a perfectly timed comedy about Ryan Bingham, a corporate downsizing expert (George Clooney) who is hired by numerous companies to fire their employees. The title comes both from the character’s obsession with collecting frequent flyer miles and the unexpected turns his career and personal life take.
Like the director’s Thank You For Smoking, which was about a smug tobacco industry spin doctor, Reitman prefers anti-heroes to anything resembling a traditional protagonist — a tendency he compares to the films of his father, Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters).
“Imagine for a second my father and I were musicians,” Reitman explained. “My father wants to take a song you love and play it better than you’ve ever heard it before. I want to take a song you hate and play it so well that you learn to like it.”
Like Thank You For Smoking, Up in the Air is an adaptation of a novel. Reitman’s palpably irreverent attitude toward just about everything clearly embodies his style as a writer.
“There’s no question of faithfulness,” Reitman said. “I think there’s something in that book that responded to a question I had already wanted to ask, and at that point I’m going to use that book for everything it has and not use the stuff that doesn’t fit my mold.”
Up in the Air continues Reitman’s trend of ambiguous endings, a philosophy he explained when asked to account for his protagonist’s final destination at the end of the film.
“I have no idea where he goes,” Reitman said flippantly. “The honest answer is it doesn’t really matter. Half the audience thinks one thing, half the audience thinks the other. That’s how I know I did my job right.”
Anna Kendrick stars as Natalie, a young go-getter who butts heads with the experienced Clooney in trying to streamline the firing process. While filming Up in the Air, Kendrick frequently crossed over to the world of florid teenage vampire romance for the Twilight series, in which she plays high school queen bee Jessica.
“I feel like I have the best of both worlds,” Kendrick explained. “I’m a part of this thing that is such a big deal to a lot of people, but I completely recognize that I don’t play a very instrumental part of. And then I get to go and play at the grown-ups’ table.”
The up-and-coming 23-year-old actress displayed the same youthful and ironic wit as her director when asked about the question she hears most when recognized by Twilight fans.
“They ask me what Rob [Pattinson] is like. And I say, ‘He’s great,’” Kendrick said, before adding a slightly exhausted, “as I’ve said in every interview.”
But despite her sudden visibility in two major films, Kendrick still acts a little starstruck at the drop of Clooney’s name. She explained that Clooney thankfully didn’t pull any of his famous on-set pranks on her.
“He knows that the girl that’s wondering what she’s doing on a George Clooney movie in the first place is not the girl that you play a prank on while you’re filming,” Kendrick said. “But he’s goofy. He’d be like playing Nerf ball around my head as I’m trying to get prepared for a scene and I’d feel like I’m the mom and he’s the teenager: ‘George! I’m trying to focus!’”
Kendrick’s experience seemed typical of the on-set atmosphere fostered by a cheeky superstar and his equally irreverent director. Reitman’s wicked and weird sense of humor, which fits so well with the kinds of films he makes, is taking the routine world of press tours by storm. Reitman even made a chart of his most frequently asked questions.
Still, Reitman had a lot of original things to say on his return trip to Los Angeles. A former USC student, the Oscar-nominated Reitman explained how he built his career while studying as an English major.
“I started making short films there,” Reitman said. “While I was at USC I wrote [film] reviews for the Daily Trojan — bad ones. I was in Commedus Interruptus, I had a radio show on KSCR and I started a desk calendar company where we sold ad space to every company in the area. I took that advertising money and I made my first short film.”
After giving me a friendly “Fight On,” he asked if there were any students from UCLA in the room. When a counterpart from the Daily Bruin raised his hand, Reitman joked, “Oh dude, no more answers for you.”
It sounded just like something one of his characters would say.

When word got out that John Woo was making a historical war film, few knew what to expect. An army of white doves? Close-quarter crossbow shootouts?
Instead, the director of Hong Kong gangster classics such as Hard Boiled delivers an intense retelling of The Battle of Red Cliffs in ancient China. Though not a perfect war film, Red Cliff has enough flair and ambition to let us all know that crossbows are just as cool as submachine guns.
Battle cry · John Woo’s Red Cliff, which is set in 208 CE, has become the highest grossing film in mainland China since it opened in 2008. - Photo courtesy of Magnolia Pictures
It’s the year 208 CE, and Prime Minister Cao Cao of the Han Dynasty has no problems bossing his young emperor around. When his hunt for rebels ends in the slaughter of innocent villagers, some nobles such as Lui Bei decide enough is enough. With the help of his wise adviser, Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei allies with Viceroy Zhou Yu, another southern noble, and together they face off against Cao Cao’s 800,000-man army.
As a veteran of modern action flicks, Woo has his own ideas about Chinese third-century warfare. On a large scale, the massive battles are historical, with chessboard tactics and epic charges.
Up close, however, the action becomes more stylized, with some fighters body-slamming horses and impaling four people with a single spear thrust. These up close moments give the film a definite flair and original feel that manages to sidestep the risk of feeling hokey.
Woo does not create the kabuki-esque fights seen in Hero, and has no qualms dishing out the blood and gore, but the larger than life parts of the film make it feel less like a historical film and more like a war song in the vein of Herodotus’ Histories compared to Frank Miller’s 300. Or for Chinese history fans, more like Romance of the Three Kingdoms than Records of the Three Kingdoms.
This characteristic leads Red Cliff into its chief problem. Epics are great, but they cannot be half-done. Red Cliff still clings to the desire to be a historical film. The switches from realistic to grandiosity are jarring. Ultimately, they make it difficult for the audience to connect with the film.
This connection is what separates Gladiator from Gods and Generals. Without it, the film is left hanging on a museum wall instead of jumping off the screen and dragging you in.
Red Cliff may feel stage-y, but its cast does not. Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who had such a burning intensity in Lust, Caution, is completely believable as the warrior-poet Zhou Yu. He does not need to have his whole family slaughtered to show us war is painful — it’s all there in glances and murmurs.
Zhang Fengyi, who plays Cao Cao, gives an ambitious humanity to what could easily be a one-dimensional villain.
Bringing up the girl’s team is Wei Zhou as Zhou Yu’s sister, Sun Shangxiang, who is fierce without blatant “girl power” rah-rahs. Less interesting is Chiling Lin as Zhou Yu’s swan-necked wife, Xiao Qaoi, whose plot arc seems just a little too maudlin and convenient.
The best performance belongs to Takeshi Kaneshiro as Zhuge Liang. Behind his every smile, you have no idea if he’s planning a bloody ambush or just enjoying the music. If Woo ever delves more into the Three Kingdoms period, Kaneshiro would be fantastic reprising his role and taking the reins as one of the period’s greatest thinkers.
Through no fault of the cast, Red Cliff can be hard to follow, especially for those unfamiliar with Chinese history. Trying to keep track of who’s fighting also distracts from the clanging swords and flying heads. Most characters are introduced through dialogue, but the audience has no time to make sense of the information overload. These exposition bombs come from the cuts made for the American release — the original Chinese cut is almost five hours, and was released as a two-part saga.
Despite its flaws, Red Cliff is still a very entertaining film. It is simply impossible to ignore its ambitious style and Woo has definitely begun to absolve himself of his sins in Paycheck.
It is always interesting to see the results of a talented director branching out into new genres. Woo proves he is just as capable of staging fights on the battlefield as he is in teahouses. Red Cliff may not cement itself as the definitive Three Kingdoms film, but it’s worth its weight in popcorn.
I liked Woo’s other flicks, maybe too violent for American tastes, like “The Killer, A Better Tomorrow, Hard Boiled…”
Those defined the “Hong Kong” shooters.

Moments when schoolwork and real life collide are weirdly pleasurable. Such was the experience while I was reading a recent story titled “Satan, the great motivator,”  published by The Boston Globe on “the curious economic effects of religion.”
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Immediately, my political philosophy class popped into my head, specifically in the form of Max Weber. When Weber was referenced later in the piece, I knew my education had not betrayed me.
Students of the field may recall, painfully, the name Weber, an obscure, hard-to-understand German philosopher whose legacy-defining “aha” moment was his flashy but much-criticized conclusion that Protestantism birthed modern capitalism. He published his thesis in a book-length essay now more than a century old.
Time has not been kind to old Weber. Much of his work has been dismissed as methodologically flawed, and professors won’t devote more than a few classes, if that, to the study of his contributions to sociology.
But if Michael Fitzgerald over at the Globe did his reporting right, Weber may have been on to something. The problem is that most people will use the findings to stress the need for religion in society — not as a fresh perspective for American economists.
Fitzgerald’s piece, published last month, basically reiterates the essence of Weber’s anti-Marxist thesis: Religion can indeed influence economic behavior. A new study from Harvard shows a strong correlation in developing countries “between economic growth and certain shifts in belief.”
“Most strikingly,” Fitzgerald said, “if belief in hell jumps up sharply while actual church attendance stays flat, it correlates with economic growth … Meanwhile, if church attendance actually rises, it slows growth in developing economies.”
It smells a lot like America’s sketchy stay-at-home religiosity: Believe in hell and salvation, but leave church for the old folks.
Apparently it works from an economic standpoint, which makes sense. Hardworking entrepreneurs don’t have time for public worship.
The Harvard study has started economists off on a new re-evaluation of religion’s role in economic development, with several new findings claiming that religious values are economically beneficial.
Trouble is, we’re getting slightly overexcited here, and a re-evaluation of the re-evaluation is clearly in order. The implications of these new findings are hard to understand and remarkably easy to misinterpret.
According to Fitzgerald, researchers in the United States reportedly showed that “religion reduces corruption and increases respect for law in ways that boost overall economic growth.” This seems faulty.
Skepticism feels like the right policy at the moment, especially with examples like this last one — semi-novel notions built on shaky, unprovable premises.
Here, our researchers have set up a weak correlation between two distant variables, much as Weber did more than a century earlier.
Once we make that literal leap of faith between religion’s influence and economic prosperity, we suddenly concede the scary possibility that the cure for economic woes is an even wider-spread religious fervency both here and abroad, where that same religiosity is often at the heart of domestic unrest.
And who’s to say people won’t take these spurious claims even further, to the point where they start believing — and researchers start proving — that religion is the final panacea for every earthly problem?
Churches, or any other religious institution, do not need that kind of scientific approval.
None of us should balk at the obvious notion that religion increases respect for law — being repeatedly beaten over the head with, say, the Ten Commandments, will have that socially beneficial effect — but work in this field is still preliminary, and should be regarded with a certain caution.
The value of the new studies is not necessarily in what they mean for religion, but rather in what they mean for economics.
Until now, economists have not spent sufficient time considering the implications of other fields of study — psychology, sociology and indeed theology — in economic behavior.
Studies like these point to a widening out of economic perspective, which seems essential if we are to get at a fuller understanding of what drives economic development.
“Today, as researchers start to answer the question more definitively with the tools of modern economics,” Fitzgerald writes, “what’s emerging is a clearer picture of how nations’ prosperity can depend, in part, on seemingly abstract concerns like theology — and sometimes on quite nuanced points of belief or religious fervor.”
Clearly. But we must be wary of taking that too far — or we risk losing favor with God, who, after all, doesn’t seem to think too highly of material wealth.

If I may be so bold, God wants his followers to be wealthy. However, God does not want wealth to become a replacement for Creator worship. Remember the Creator of all things made wealth also.

For all of the notable academic awards, athletic achievements, amenities and extremely well-connected alumni USC has to offer, it just can’t seem to shake its reputation as an unsafe school.
Any UCLA student would be happy to rattle off the alarming statistics that paint USC’s campus and its surrounding area as a war-torn jungle compared to the tranquil pastures of Westwood. This stigma persists even in light of the rapid transformation of the area surrounding University Park in the recent years, under the watchful eye of President Steven B. Sample.
The Department of Public Safety reported earlier this week that there was an unusually high number of property crime that took place over Thanksgiving Break.
Hearing the complaints of students and parents alike following a tumultuous year for campus area crimes, and perhaps acting out of necessity, the administration responded this year by increasing the presence of DPS officers in the area and introducing the now ubiquitous yellow jacket-clad Contemporary Services Corporation officials around campus.
Our prayers have been answered!
Unfortunately, student reaction to these new measures has been lukewarm.
The number of DPS personnel in the area has been a comforting presence for many, but with many more officers patrolling off-campus areas, there have been considerably more opportunities for these school officials to crack down on those who just want to party.
And in regard to the CSC army that has been spread and strategically stationed in the area surrounding campus, the common student response is not one of enthusiastic thanks, but rather a sense of confusion as to whether one can get away with riding their bike in the crosswalk in front of such personnel.
Additionally, it’s been revealed that DPS uses strategically placed surveillance cameras around campus to monitor the safety of students around campus, especially those who choose to walk around alone late at night. The “video escort” service allows DPS officers to step in and respond to potential incidents before they happen.
Helpful as it may be, the policy was unbeknownst to many — until, well, two days ago, because of an article published in the Daily Trojan. Rather than looking to such a policy as a “guardian angel” asset, the more common response is one that sees the video escorting service as an invasion of privacy that in the same vein as the Truman Show or an Orwellian Big Brother.
But as much as we would like to stand up in arms against well-intentioned preventative policies that seem to invade our personal privacy, there’s no doubt that we would willingly to spit out any relevant personal information faster than you can say “irony” in the event that we found ourselves in a position of need.
So herein lies the problem: We don’t know what we want, and we complain when we get what we think we do want.
We want the campus to be safer.
And in hearing these requests, it appears that the university has listened and taken concerted steps to help to counter the notion of danger that has hung around the USC campus for so long.
But any time anything goes wrong, there is an outcry for the university to act in a way to prevent future instances. But when such policies are enacted, there is a greater tendency to balk.
Curious.
Perhaps it’s true that you can’t have your cake and eat it too. But in regard to the student response to the steps toward safety at USC, it seems that we’re getting our cake, throwing it at the wall and then asking for more cake.
Being watched to ensure a safe passage home?  Stopping at crosswalks on campus? Mandatory bike registration?
Sure, it takes a lot out of you.
We can’t continue to value personal preference and convenience over necessity if it’s in the safety interests of us all.
This is what we asked for.
This is what we need.
Soojin Yoon is a junior majoring in public relations. His column, “Boy Meets Word,” ran Thursdays.
Here’s the thing, USC could’ve white-flighted it out of this part of Los Angeles and moved to former Marine Corps base, El Toro, CA back in 1994. After the Watts Riots Pepperdine said “we outtie!!!”
There are political gestures and implications as to why USC didn’t white-flight it out of “south central,” as our admirers across town adorn us the title with.
The pitfalls to being in the ‘hood is that if you’re a sheltered, wealthy youth, you better be on your toes and act cool around here.
The upside is that it conditions us to be more down-to-earth via programs like JEP, “Good Neighbors,” etc.
We are ‘SC!
Good article, for the most part.  I agree that students seem to expect solutions to problems, yet tend to cry out once those solutions are enforced.   I believe this is an issue with students’ lack of participation in policy-making at USC.  For many students, it is difficult to even know about ways to participate, until the Daily Trojan covers it.  But by then, it’s too late to participate.
When you mentions stopping at crosswalks on campus, I assume that you are talking about bicycles.  But it’s not just bicycles that should stop–Campus Cruiser, DPS SUVs, and chariots should also stop at Stop signs, not simply at all crosswalks.  It is the pedestrian’s responsibility to exercise caution when entering a street.  Pedestrians may have the right of way, but that doesn’t mean that pedestrians can choose to keep their eyes off the road while talking on their cellphone.  Pedestrians should still at least look down the street.
Excellent article and a great point! Well done.
Great article, your exactly right!  I hate reading about students who complain about everything; be thankful you attend USC and be appreciative when they try to help you.

The Panhellenic Council is set to begin a push to increase its commitment to philanthropy and academics, as it ushers in the new executive board members for the 2010 calendar year.
The newly elected board, led by incoming President Laura Redfern and Executive Vice President Hilary Veit, was announced Nov. 23 and will be initiated Dec. 10. Next semester, the council will start reviewing the budget and the amount of money that each programming committee is allotted with a focus on making everything more efficient, Redfern said.
“We need to see where there are areas of the budget where funds are being underutilized so we can put them toward other activities,” Redfern said. “Once we recognize how much money we have, then we can expand our programming.”
Sorority recruitment is costing less each year despite an increase in membership, Redfern said, which has prompted plans to redistribute funds to philanthropy, marketing and scholarship programming.
This year the board, for the first time, offered five Greek scholarships, and the new board plans to add more or increase the amounts from $1,000 to $1,500.
“The first year scholarships were a success,” Redfern said. “Our efforts are trying to improve to meet the caliber of Greeks that we had, because there is also [more] need during the recession and more girls who need help paying for their dues.”
Ada Del Rosso, incoming vice president of finance, said the executive board should also focus on publicizing the scholarship opportunities and the financial aid options.
“We may see fewer people joining sororities next year, but there are ways of getting help, scholarships and financial aid,” Del Rosso said. “I hope in the future we can emphasize the fact that it is a financial cost but it is worth it in the end.”
Ayushi Gummadi, who was elected vice president of scholarship, said she also hopes to increase the importance that Greeks place on academics.
“I want to encourage scholarship chairs to have a bigger say within each house, and increase chapter scholarship chairs’ involvement with the Panhellenic board,”  Gummadi said.
The new executive board also plans to increase the emphasis put on philanthropy events for students across the board, by increasing the number of service days held during the school year and moving from a national focus to more service for the local community.
“I would like to see us do more for the surrounding community as well, something that would make it a safe philanthropy for students, do something on campus to raise money to help out some kind of local organization that helps out with crime reduction,” Redfern said.
The new year also presents an opportunity to better utilize the budget beyond the major events that the council puts up, according to Tracy Moyers, the outgoing vice president of finance for Panhellenic.
“I want to encourage the new board to utilize the budget more efficiently,” Moyers said. “I hope to see them make chapter dues and individual member dues more affordable, and also ease in more scholarships.”
Moyers said she also hopes the new board will focus on increasing Greek unity on the Row and Panhellenic visibility on campus.
“I really hope that they can get the whole Row more involved in things as a whole,” Moyers said. “A lot of times we do great things but they are disjointed with each individual chapter. To move forward, we need to bind together more and sort of have a united front.”
The first major event Panhellenic will focus on for the upcoming semester is the annual spring Greek Gala, which will be held in March, Redfern said.

Students who think they’re being watched as they walk home late at night are probably right — but that’s a good thing.
When Department of Public Safety officers notice students walking alone, they will often focus their security cameras on the student to make sure they stay safe.
Eagle eye · In addition to vehicle patrols, Department of Public Safety officers also work to keep people safe through the video escort program, which relies on 15 security cameras. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
These “video escorts,” which have been in place for a while, are initiated by DPS when a student seems to be in a potentially harmful situation, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
“We have security officers monitoring the cameras around the clock,” Carlisle said. “If it’s late at night, and if a student is walking alone, we tell officers to video escort them.”
The video escorts are limited to the 15 security cameras placed on poles on street corners and on USC property, Carlisle said. Carlisle noted that these cameras can only be placed on university property, but he could not give the exact location of the cameras for security reasons.
The cameras are on 24 hours per day, and they each have a line of sight of about a block in two different directions.
But because the security cameras are only in certain locations, video escorts are limited to particular areas. Carlisle said DPS is currently budgeting to implement significantly more cameras around campus in hopes of expanding the eye of surveillance.
“If someone was at, say, Hoover and 27th [streets], and they were to walk back to campus, we wouldn’t have cameras for all those areas they’d have to traverse to get back here,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle could not disclose how much it would cost to expand surveillance efforts, but some students think the effort may not be worth it at any cost.
“I don’t know if it would make it any safer,” said Michael Jacobs, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. “It could be a waste of money.”
Currently, these video escorts are initiated and conducted by DPS, but Carlisle said much of the burden of safety falls on the shoulders of the students themselves.
“If a student was feeling unsafe on campus, we hope that they’d call an escort, take a cab, take Campus Cruiser or call DPS to see if an officer is available for a free ride,” Carlisle said.
Although Carlisle said the video patrols are solely for the safety and benefit of students, some students weren’t comfortable knowing that DPS may be watching them.
Krystal Rodriguez, a freshman majoring in communication, had similar feelings.
“I understand that they do all this for security and protection,” Rodriguez said. “But just the idea of having a camera follow you around is sort of creepy.”
Other students, however, said the video escorts are a good precaution to take.
“I don’t really mind,” said Chloe Cotoulas, a freshman majoring in political science. “They’re doing it for our own well-being, and I don’t mind being monitored or temporarily followed on a security camera if it means I’m going to be safer.”
Karn Chopra, a freshman majoring in economics, agreed, saying that sacrificing some privacy was worth it for the safety of the student.
“DPS is doing the right thing,” Chopra said. “I really don’t see the problem with this. It’s all for the benefit of the student.”
Annie Yuan, a junior majoring in communication and psychology, said video escorts were a good attempt at making the area safer, but said there seemed to be a few flaws in the system.
“Obviously we need more security around campus,” she said. “I know it’s not necessary everywhere, but I feel like they can’t watch everyone and I feel like some people want to be left alone.”

As the last of the merit scholarship applications roll in today, Trojan hopefuls will find the competition tougher than ever. The number of scholarship applicants will almost undoubtedly increase but the number of scholarships offered is down from past years.
“Every year more and more students apply for our scholarships deadline,” said Tim Brunold, the director of undergraduate admission. “[But] this last year was we reduced the number of scholarships slightly.”

The merit money comes from the financial aid budget, which is made up of funds from student tuition. The budget is split among need-based scholarships, athletics and specialized talent scholarships, and academic scholarships.
Recently, the funds have been redistributed. Administrators said that with more students needing financial aid, less money should go to merit scholarships.
“They want to be sure that there is need-based financial aid for continuing students,” said Gene Bickers, the vice provost of undergraduate programs. “In terms of making sure that the need-based pool is there and that we are not going to have anyone that needs to leave the university because of unforeseen financial circumstances — that is the first and most important priority.”
Despite the slight shift, Brunold said he does not expect the number of scholarships to continue to decline.
“Next year will look very much like it did this last year,” he said. “Generally we have found that the balance works well.”
Generally, Brunold said, about 20 to 22 percent of the incoming class receives some sort of merit scholarship.
Though the merit scholarships take money from the financial aid budget, Brunold said administrators feel the investment is worth it.
“The merit scholarships program is helping us meet our enrollment goal,” Brunold said. “It makes us feel like it is a great program that is well worth continuing.”
Some students agreed that offering merit scholarships helped bring students to USC.
“It is necessary to give out merit scholarships,” said Tisa Thomas, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, who receives a Presidential scholarship. “You have students who will look at USC more seriously.”
Most students — scholarship recipients or not — said they think the merit scholarships are good for the school.
“Having the merit scholarship program sends a message that USC does value intelligent students and that is the kind of student body we have here,” said Blanca Maldonado, a senior majoring in business administration.
Other students said the scholarship program is good because it brings high-caliber students to USC.
“If they are really that bright I think it is worth it,” said Will Cooper, a senior majoring in business administration. “I like to think the next Albert Einsteins are at USC.”
Some, however, said they worry there are other qualified students who are not given the opportunity to receive merit scholarships.
“The merit scholarships are good but they should offer some scholarships to more of the international students,” said Sameer Sabberwal, a first-year master’s student studying electrical engineering. “It will heighten the number of international students who want to study here.”
Some students said the scholarships should be offered to a wider variety of students — currently, merit scholarships are only available to incoming freshmen.
“They should open it up every year for students to try to get a merit scholarship,” said Vikram Paranjpe, a freshman majoring in health and humanity who receives the National Merit Finalist Presidential scholarship.
Nonetheless, most people feel that overall the merit scholarship program has been successful in drawing top students to the university.
“They attract students who would have gone to better schools,” Paranjpe said. “But because they got a scholarship, they are more likely to come here.”

In an effort to offer a guide for the division of archaeological sites between Israel and Palestine in the event of a peace agreement, the USC Digital Library earlier this week presented the first public map of the sites based on research commissioned by a USC professor and other researchers.
The West Bank and East Jerusalem Searchable Map, using a Google map interface, on the library’s website, includes the names, locations, components and periods of nearly 7,000 archaeological sites in the contested region.

The map was an initiative of the Israeli-Palestinian Archaeology Working Group, which includes Lynn Dodd, a lecturer of religion at USC, curator of the USC Archaeology Research Center and one of the project leaders; Ran Boytner, director of international research at the UCLA Cotsen Institute of Archaeology; and a team of prominent Israeli and Palestinian archaeologists and negotiators.
The group was created in 2005 to negotiate a plan on how to govern the archaeological sites in Israel and Palestine if a peace deal is brokered between the two sides.
“You cannot get a good divorce unless you know who has what,” Boytner said. “Now, when the negotiators are talking about dividing the border, they will have that information.”
Dodd and Boytner, who met as graduate students at UCLA, said they began the project after discovering that, unlike other issues like refugees and the fate of Jerusalem, nothing had been done to address the archaeological sites in the region.
“We realized that there was no way anyone could negotiate terms for archaeology because the records didn’t exist,” Dodd said. “The last 40 years of Israeli archaeology in the occupied territory was not publicly available.”
Dodd said she believes the map fills a void in the painting of a complete picture of not only Israel, but also the surrounding countries of Jordan and Syria. Without the map, she said, it would be impossible to write the history of archaeology in the region.
“It’s like trying to write the history of early colonial America with only information about eight colonies,” Dodd said. “There’s a huge hole. [The map] is a valuable resource if you’re trying to paint a complete picture of archaeology in this part of the world.”
The Israeli-Palestinian Archaeology Working Group collaborated with two researchers, Rafi Greenberg of Tel Aviv University and Adi Keinan of the University College London, to conduct research and collect data for the map of the archaeological sites. The research group was initially denied the information and sued the civil administration of the Israeli province in order to gain access to it.
After winning the suit and collecting the data, Dodd worked with Matt Gainer, director of the USC Digital Library and its information technology department to provide an avenue for everyone to view the data through the Google map.
“We are able to make the content available in a non-partisan environment — opening it up for broad inquiry and objective consideration,” Gainer said.
In recognition of this transparency and the political relevance of the map, the group won the 2009 ASOR Open Archaeology Prize from the American Schools of Oriental Research earlier this month. Ashley Sands, an alumna who worked with Dodd as an undergraduate studying archaeology, said the openness of the project sets it apart.
“One of the complaints I’ve heard from colleagues is that researchers have not been transparent with their work,” said Sands, who also co-founded a student group that discusses the relationship between archaeology, heritage and politics, with Dodd’s help. “The fact that this project was published for everyone to see directly combats that problem.”
The map is still a work in progress, according to Dodd, who plans to develop PowerPoint slides to give greater detail of the individual sites and eventually make the database downloadable.
For now though, Dodd said she is just happy that they were able to pull off the project after the obstacles they faced in collecting and presenting the data.
“We pulled together Israelis and Palestinians and created this resource so that it would help safeguard the archaeological heritage for the Israelis, for the Palestinians, and for everybody else,” she said.

As the number of people on campus decreases during breaks, the number of crimes typically increases, and this Thanksgiving break was no exception.
During the recent break, four car burglaries, one bike theft and one residential burglary were reported to the Department of Public Safety. According to DPS Capt. David Carlisle, these numbers are unusual compared to typical weeks.

“I would say four auto burglaries in one week is not a typical week,” Carlisle said. “One burglary and one bike theft wouldn’t be unusual, but four burglaries in that short span of four days is more than we’d like to see, and it’s more than we typically see.”
During the holidays, crime trends shift from crimes against persons to property crimes, Carlisle said.
“The opportunity for students to be robbed is reduced because they’re leaving,” he said. “We look at where we are vulnerable: student housing, unlocked bikes, cars left parked in structures or off campus on the street.”
In an effort to reduce car burglaries, DPS initiated Operation GIFT — Group Initiative For Theft prevention — offering free guarded parking spots for USC students, faculty and staff in the Parking Center.
“If students want to park on campus they have to pay and the alternative to that is parking on the street where they are more vulnerable, so in order to reduce the number of automobile burglaries we offer free parking in the parking structure,” Carlisle said.
This year, 274 people parked their cars in the Parking Center over the holiday break, and none of the cars were burglarized, Carlisle said.
“We did have one car broken into in Parking Structure D during the holidays, so we’re disappointed about that,” Carlisle said. “The other three burglaries occurred off campus, but had they been parked in the parking structure, I think we could have avoided those four crimes.”
Looking forward to winter break, Carlisle said DPS will be launching a crime prevention publicity campaign, as well as offer the GIFT program again.
DPS suggests students should make sure their apartments are locked and their property is secured. Carlisle said students might want to stop mail delivery and invest in automatic porch lights when they are away for long periods of time.
“Burglars do know people are gone for Christmas break,” Carlisle said. “Students should do things to make it look like they’re not gone for three weeks so they don’t become targets for burglars.”
Although crime statistics do fluctuate during the holiday seasons, Carlisle said crime around USC has continued to decline overall.
“We’d like all of the students to help us keep crime down by not putting themselves in a position to be victims of crime themselves,” Carlisle said.
