After three hours of deliberation on Wednesday night, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted against removing Commuter Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn from his position, but elected to suspend his stipend for the remainder of his time in office, according to a statement released by USG late Thursday night.
Ellenhorn will be allowed to finish out his term as Senator — set to end on April 1 — but will be denied the final $250 installment of his stipend.
“Ultimately, while the Senate did not impeach Senator Ellenhorn, they wish to express that his actions were inappropriate and irresponsible as a Senator  in the USC Undergraduate Student Government,” the statement said.
Not enough Senators voted for the outright removal of Ellenhorn, but the majority agreed that his actions warranted disciplinary action, the statement said.
The impeachment hearing was held after Program Board Executive Director Diana Jiménez  filed a formal complaint earlier this month against Ellenhorn, alleging that he acted contrary to his responsibility as USG senator and violated USG bylaws.
The statement said that three possible infractions were discussed by the Senate in regards to Ellenhorn: mishandling meetings with students, bringing speakers to campus that made for an unhealthy campus environment and improper use of filming at Program Board events.
The senators came to the decision that Ellenhorn did not follow established protocol when holding meetings he had promised with students that did not feel properly represented by the Women’s Student Assembly, and that he had violated the USC Code of Ethics when bringing controversial speakers, such as conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos, to campus.
The senators decided that Ellenhorn violated USG Code of Ethics Section 5 by filming a Program Board event that “he intended to vilify, as it does not contribute to a respectful environment at the University,” according to the statement.
The Senate released their decision 24 hours following the conclusion of the hearing, as was outlined in their bylaws.
“The Senators hope this decision serves as model [sic] for the whole organization to promote intellectually diverse dialogue without partisan bias and alienation,” the statement said.
Shame on USC’s Undergraduate Student Government for taking any action against Senator Ellenhorn.  It has been my observation for years that the liberal mantra of tolerance and inclusion extends only to those who agree with them, as any other opinion is quickly vilified, marginalized, mischaracterized, or “impeached”.  
In the good-cop/bad-cop world of politics, Democrats have always been the good cops who will coddle you and tell you exactly what you want to hear.  They are the feel good party with little conviction beyond “whatever works for you”.  Republicans have always been the bad cops that have to remind you of the ugly but important truths we’d rather forget.  Republicans are like the parent that believes true love often includes being told “no”.  For these and many reasons, Republicans have always been a minority unto themselves…. the road less traveled.  Democrats and liberals have always found a particularly welcoming platform in our nation’s universities, and for this reason alone, it is absolutely critical that the USG protect a conservative voice such as Jacob’s.  Jacob’s conservative positions on critical issues of our time deserve to be heard, and his valuable contribution to the USG should be protected… not impeached.
I’ve noticed that Democrats tend to get the benefit of people who simply don’t care about any given issue.  This is because their message is always so appealing on the surface.  People who are uninformed or don’t care will probably vote Democrat.  On the other hand, Republicans have to earn their votes.  Republicans may be contrarians, but their positions are not “extreme” or “hateful” as Democrats would have you believe.
There is nothing hateful or extreme about insisting people come to this country legally, or face deportation if they don’t.   It’s not hateful or extreme to suggest building a border wall where illegal immigration continues almost unabated.  We build walls and fences around our homes and communities all the time.  Good fences make good neighbors.
There is nothing hateful or extreme about insisting people use the bathroom of their gender, regardless of how they “feel”.  It’s not radical to remind people that gender is indeed a binary system that is, with the rarest of exceptions, identified at birth.   It is not hateful or extreme to remind people that in reality one can not change their gender… despite dressing in drag, changing their name, or having multiple elective surgeries.
Their is nothing hateful or extreme about suggesting that the only way to truly be fair, unbiased and non-discriminatory is to insist that things like college admission or Oscar nominations be merit based… and that it is unfair, counterproductive, and typically misleading to suggest racism is at work every time a minority is under-represented.
There remains a lot of injustice in our world, but silencing the intelligent, reasoned and often correct voice of conservatives is not the answer.  The Left is responsible for a tremendous over-correction in its sincere but often misguided attempt to address injustice.  Democrats have moved from the reasonable notions of tolerance and acceptance, to celebration and promotion.  It is critical that the minority voice of politics be heard.  I am glad that Jacob Ellenhorn was not removed from his position on the USG at USC, but it is discouraging to see that the purported goals of “intellectually diverse dialogue” and bipartisanship are apparently empty and meaningless.

Carmen Puliafito, dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC, announced his resignation Thursday in an email addressed to the faculty, staff and students of the school.
“I am grateful for the opportunity of leading this medical school over the past eight and a half years,” Puliafito wrote in the email.
Puliafito has been the dean since 2007, when he took over from the previous dean Brian Henderson. He earned his degree in medicine from Harvard University and an M.B.A from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. Before becoming dean, Puliafito was the director of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and the chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.
Puliafito stepped down to “return to academic ophthalmology and pursue some identified opportunities in healthcare,” according to the statement. Provost Michael Quick also sent out an email to the faculty, staff and students of Keck.
“We are grateful to Dr. Puliafito for his service to the university,” wrote Quick in his email. “The contributions he made to our medical enterprise are numerous and long lasting.”
Quick also announced USC professor Rohit Varma — the Grace and Emery Beardsley Chair in Ophthalmology, ophthalmology chair at Keck, director of the Eye Institute and president of USC Care Medical Group — as interim dean.
“An accomplished physician-scientist, Dr. Varma also is a dedicated and capable leader and we appreciate his service in this interim role,” Quick said.
Puliafito said in his press release that he feels proud of the school’s accomplishments during the time he served as a dean.
“I would like to thank each and every one of you for the wonderful support and encouragement that you have provided me during my term as dean and look forward to rejoining the faculty and pursuing some exciting new career directions,” Puliafito said in his email.

Hip-hop artist MF DOOM is an enigma. Starting from his early work as ZEV LOVE X with KMD in the early ’90s, DOOM has proven himself to be one of rap’s most creative and prolific forces. Yet little is known about his personal life — and that’s the way he likes it. 
He always wears a Dr. Doom mask (MF = Metal Face) and rarely makes public appearances as DOOM. Still, the 45 year-old New York native is a treasure of the underground hip-hop community. He started to obtain more mainstream recognition with the release of Madvillainy, a collaborative effort with producer Madlib. That same year DOOM also released a solo effort — Mm…Food. (The title is not only indicative of the album’s cuisine-based theme, but also functions as a clever anagram of MF DOOM.)
DOOM’s talent as a producer is special, as Mm…Food so brilliantly displays. DOOM’s sampling style is completely his own — most songs on the record (and on many other DOOM tracks) both dialogue and melody samples from old Fantastic Four cartoons, fitting with DOOM’s association with Dr. Doom. For example, the album’s opener, “Beef Rapp,” starts with a medley of dialogue samples that set the tone for what is to come. There are constant references to food — more specifically to the lack of availability of food — as the backing drums and sampled cartoon-score swell up. Finally, the beat drops. DOOM starts spitting effortlessly over a sample of the score of “Canon of Doom,” a Spiderman episode released in 1981. He is here to feed the people, who are hungry for rap.
“Beef Rap” is about just that — beef in rap. Every song on the album has a title referring to some specific food, which is used as a symbol of that song’s subject. In “Beef Rap” and throughout the album, DOOM uses cannibalism as a metaphor for crushing other rappers with skill. He warns rappers, “Beef rap could lead to gettin’ teeth capped/Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap.” Clearly, DOOM’s style of bragging is not typical. His use of food as a metaphor for is constant. Later on “Beef Rapp,” he mingles his threats with some poignant social commentary: “Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears/Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares/The odd pair swears and God fears/Even when it’s rotten, we’ve gotten through the hard years.” His obsession with internal rhyming is beyond impressive, and I say without hyperbole that I believe DOOM’s lyrical prowess is second to none.  
“Vomitspit” is further evidence of this. On this track, DOOM muses about the state of the rap game and makes clear to the listener that he’s never sold out: “Real rhymes not your everyday hologram/Even when ribs was touchin’ never swallowed the ham.” DOOM, a Muslim, is saying that even when he was at his lowest low, he didn’t give in to industry pressures. He ties food into this idea by using pork as a symbol for those pressures — even if he were starving, he wouldn’t eat pork because that would violate his faith. “Vomitspit” is also the album’s most succinct and enjoyable track. It features a sped-up sample of “Happy You Should Be” by Canadian fusion group Mashmakhan. It is an instrumental that evokes a cool sense of nostalgia, fitting well with the song’s lyrics.
The album’s middle section consists of four bizarre instrumentals, propelled forward by sampling of dialogue from a wide variety of often obscure TV shows and movies. In fact, as much as I try, I can’t find the source of some of these samples. This section could potentially spoil this album for some. I wasn’t too crazy about it myself when I first got into Mm…Food. But over time, it grew on me. Those four songs truly display DOOM’s commitment to his artistry and his dedication to putting his unique stamp on everything he touches. “Gumbo” is a particularly hilarious track — it contains a sample from a cooking show that discusses “edible rappers.” Again, DOOM is hinting at his ability to ‘eat other rappers up’ with his skills. 
No evaluation of Mm…Food would be complete without discussing “Rap Snitch Knishes,” which contains the album’s best feature from a mysterious artist, “Mr. Fantastik.” He’s fascinating because nobody knows who he is. He appears on only one other DOOM song, and on both tracks he drops an amazing verse. (It has been speculated that Mr. Fantastik is just one of DOOM’s personal friends who happens to be an incredibly talented rapper.) DOOM and Fantastik have a good laugh at rappers snitching on themselves by bragging about their drug dealings. “Rap snitches, tellin’ all their business/Sit in the court and be their own star witness/’Do you see the perpetrator?’ ‘Yeah I’m right here’/F*ck around get the whole label sent up for years,” an amused Fantastik describes on the hook.
Mm…Food is a project that reveals new surprises with every listen. From the album cover to the countless samples of comical dialogue to the very last rhyme, this record truly is a piece of art. It’s DOOM’s best solo effort.

After a relatively slow start to the season, the Women of Troy have begun to find their groove, riding a four-match winning streak into their third match of Pac-12 play against the Oregon Ducks Friday. In addition to the win streak, the Trojans boast an impressive 5-2 home record that will make it difficult for the Ducks to come out of Marks Stadium with the victory.
The Trojans had a tremendous week over spring break, winning 5-2 over No. 16 Oklahoma State and a commanding 4-0 victory against Baylor at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. After struggles earlier in the year, head coach Richard Gallien said that he had a “motivated and positive group … that is focusing on what [they] can control and [are]  trying to get better day by day.” The season is starting to progress just as the coach saw it, with the young team playing their best tennis, as the most important part of the season is beginning.
The winning streak has propelled the Trojans to No. 29 in the national rankings, up 19 spots from last week. The Ducks present no easy task, with a ranking of 35 in the nation and a strong 11-3 record, including a 3-1 mark in Pac-12 play.
Oregon’s Kennan Johnson is the second highest-ranked player in the matchup at 70 behind USC’s senior Giuliana Olmos who has climbed up to an individual rank of No. 22 in the country. Oregon has one other player ranked in singles, Alyssa Tobita — who is currently ranked No. 124.
Oregon is coming off a hot streak of their own, winning nine matches in a row before falling in a tough 4-3 defeat to Arizona State last weekend. The Women of Troy are 21-0 all-time against Oregon and hope to continue this incredible run of success but despite the long-standing record, Oregon will be sure to put up a fight.
USC brings their deep, young team into the matchup. Behind Olmos, four underclassmen are ranked in the top-125. Freshman Jessica Failla has been the most productive Trojan with 15 singles wins under her belt in her first collegiate season, leading her to slide into the top-100 at No. 99. Fellow freshman Rianna Valdes is ranked No. 106, while sophomores Gabby Smith and Madison Westby ranked No. 108 and No. 123, respectively.
The sixth singles player for the Women of Troy is junior Zoë Katz who is having a strong year, despite not being ranked in singles. Katz comes into the match with the second-most wins on the team with 14 on the season and brings in additional experience as one of the older players on the team.
The Trojans plan to get on the board quickly against Oregon, starting with their top-10 doubles pair of Olmos and Smith, ranked eighth in the nation and trying to get back into the top-5 doubles ranking. The experience the younger players have gained will be key in the match, and the Trojans plan to continue their undefeated conference record.
The match will take place at the newly renovated Mark’s Stadium at 1:30 p.m.

Former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti participated in a panel discussion about terrorism, homeland security and the importance of engaging communities Thursday in the Trojan Family Room of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
In addition to Clinton and Garcetti, the panel included Jim Featherstone, former general manager of the L.A. Emergency Management department; Joumana Silvan-Saba, senior policy analyst for the City of Los Angeles Human Relations Commission; Salam Al-Marayati, president and co-founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council; and Brie Loskota, executive director of the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at USC. 
The panel discussion came at a time when terrorism and security are at the forefront of national conversation after terrorist attacks in Brussels, Belgium earlier this week. In his opening remarks, Garcetti not only praised the city’s law enforcement, but also emphasized the need for community policing.
“For every officer that we have in the right location … we also know it’s as important, if not more important, to have an officer engage in a relationship with our diverse communities, strengthening the friendships and speaking out against intolerance,” Garcetti said. 
Clinton thanked Garcetti for convening the panel and emphasized the need to hear from the panelists about their work in Los Angeles communities and not “hot rhetoric and demagoguery.” 
Clinton related a story of a taxi driver, whom she said was of Moroccan descent, who reached out to law enforcement following the attacks in Brussels as an example of the importance of community in efforts to combat terrorism. 
“We cannot allow our nation to be pitting groups of people against one another,” Clinton said. “We cannot give in to panic and fear. That’s not in keeping with our values. It’s not effective in protecting us and it plays into the hands of terrorists who want nothing more than to intimidate and terrorize people.”
Silvan-Saba continued the emphasis on community partnerships and their importance in preventing acts of violence. She said that because of the many years of work building partnerships between local and federal law enforcement as well as with communities, Los Angeles was recognized by the White House as a model at a summit in February 2015. 
“It’s healthy, strong resilient communities who are really our strongest defense against violence, all forms of violence and particularly ideologically motivated violence,” Silvan-Saba said.
Silvan-Saba said that governments and law enforcement agencies should devote resources to strengthening initiatives that are “community supported and community driven.”
Al-Marayati, who is a graduate of UCLA, joked about the rivalry between USC and his alma mater, using it as light-hearted example of the divisiveness that Clinton and others warned against. 
“We cannot win with a them versus us mentality,” Al-Marayati said. “We need to all be on the same team in effective counter terrorism policy, not be fighting each other, as the Secretary said, that’s exactly what ISIS wants. They see this is as a war with Islam and the West and the more you fuel that rhetoric, the more you play into their hands.”
Al-Marayati said that American Muslims have a difficult time being heard, and that there needs to be an effort to “amplify the moderate voice.”
“ISIS represents cruelty, Islam represents mercy. ISIS represents destructive behavior, Islam says to go and build civilization,” Al-Marayati said.
Clinton expanded on Al-Marayati’s point about the lack of moderate voices. She said that the abundance of information today makes it difficult for moderate voices to be heard and that society should make an effort to “elevate” those voices.
“The way you get eyes or ears is to be provocative, even extreme, to say things that are going to draw attention,” Clinton said.
Loskota spoke about the work of her center, which was created after the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. She said the center views communities “not as a problem to be solved, but as a tool to be unlocked.” 
Clinton noted the efforts of the Somali community in Minneapolis when it was discovered that some members were being recruited into Al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. She said that the community was eager to help address the issue, but some members were being turned away by political rhetoric. 
Garcetti said that communities should be involved in collaborative efforts apart from counterterrorism in order to bring them together and Loskota said the government should work to “reduce the barriers to participation” for communities.
Al-Marayati said there should be a partnership between community and law enforcement so that law enforcement handles criminal justice and communities deal with ideological and social issues. He said that one in six terrorist plots have been foiled because community members came forward.
“The mosques have rejected the ideology of ISIS and al-Qaeda because we feel that America is our home,” he said. “Home is not where my grandparents are buried; home is where my grandchildren are going to be raised.”
Featherstone said that groups can get involved by “convening and empowering.” He said that governments and other actors can “provide the forum for the various groups and factions to come together.”
The event was coordinated by the mayor’s office who reached out to the Undergraduate Student Government and the Political Student Assembly to provide a venue for the event and invite students to attend.
“For us as a student community to be able to engage on these topics and provide our input and start discussions is a really beautiful thing,” USG President Rini Sampath said.

Great that USC can attract speakers of this caliber. I hope that students were able to be critical as well as listen.

The Trojan track and field team is set to compete in the Power Conference Cardinal and Gold Challenge on Friday and Saturday. Friday’s events will be held at California State University Los Angeles, and Saturday’s events will take place at USC’s Loker Stadium. Though the contest has never been held before, it has attracted some great teams. The Trojans will play host to No. 1 Florida, No. 12 Texas and No. 16 Ohio State.  They may be few in number, but they are great in talent, and that should provide some very exciting competition.
However, senior distance runner Katerina Berdousi remained unfazed at the upcoming strong opposition.
“I think that stiff competition is better than no competition,” Berdousi said.
She said she didn’t want to get caught up in this particular event, focusing instead on the competitions still to come.
“My goal is not to get first; it’s to get good times in order to attend the Pac-12s and regionals,” Berdousi said.
Teammate and All-American sophomore high jumper Randall Cunningham echoed her focus.
“In all of my competitions, I like to focus on myself,” Cunningham said. “I work on my goals and compete against myself.”
The Power Conference Cardinal and Gold Challenge will be the second straight competition at home for the Trojans, following the Trojan Invitational that took place during spring break. Berdousi regretted that the invitational occurred when most students were out of town, so she’s expecting even stronger support from her fellow Trojans this weekend.
“It will be an advantage that we have more people here from USC to support us. It will be much more intense,” Berdousi said.
Adding to the intensity will be the Pac-12 Network’s cameras filming Saturday afternoon’s events for a live broadcast.
“I don’t feel any extra pressure; I just feel like it motivates us more knowing that more people will be watching us compete,” Cunningham said.
Offering a different point of view, jumps coach Sheldon Blockburger was concerned with favoritism.
“It’d be nice if everybody got fair camera time rather than focusing on the 100m and 1000m,” Blockburger said. “It’s always good to have your sport put on television, especially on a March Madness week. I’m sure everybody’s going to do their best and put on a good show.”
The California Collegiate Invitational awaits the Trojan track and field teams, following the Power Conference Cardinal and Gold Challenge. The contest will take place April 2, in San Diego.
Scheduling and start time of the meet stinks. Only two home meets, and they are a week apart. How about having one of them in April when athletes have time to space out their workouts.

In the media scrum after USC’s Pro Day wrapped up on Wednesday, junior linebacker Su’a Cravens was asked whether he was concerned about his health entering the NFL, a league marred in a concussion crisis with more and more deaths of retired players being linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease.
His response was rather unsettling.
“No,” Cravens said to the media. “I know I’m going to the game where I’m going to hit and sometimes you’re going to use your head to hit, and you might get a concussion. That’s what we sign up for. I saw that the NFL passed that they’re not going to be paying any more lawsuits on CTE from now on. So if that’s the case, let’s take helmet-to-helmet penalties out. If we know we’re signing up for that, let’s play. That’s how I look at it.”
Cravens was then asked if he had seen the movie Concussion, starring Will Smith as Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian doctor who discovered CTE. He said he hadn’t and added he wouldn’t see it because “my opinion might change then.”
In times when the public opinion surrounding football is more wary of player safety and the impact of the sport on the brain, Cravens’ stance takes a hard 180.
When simplified, his point makes sense. Players choose to participate in the sport. They decide to enter the draft. They voluntarily sign their name on the contract. They willingly strap on a helmet and pads every Sunday with the understanding that football is a contact sport and that violent hits are as embedded in the game as a touchdown or interception.
Cravens goes even further, advocating to change a common-sense rule that protects against concussions in getting rid of penalties for helmet-to-helmet hits. He is referring to a settlement between the NFL and deceased players with CTE that awarded money only to those who died between 2006 and April 2015, the year the settlement was approved.
It’s a poorly conceived argument: The NFL is no longer legally obligated to compensate for their ignorance of player safety, so therefore let’s soften the rules on violent collisions.
Still, point taken: It’s our game. We sign up for it, so stop interfering.
But it’s not that simple. On Thursday, The New York Times published an investigation tying the NFL to the tobacco industry. In several cases, league owners and officials consulted with executives in Big Tobacco on legal issues and for lobbying advice, and, in 1997, the league hired a lawyer who had previously argued cases for the tobacco industry.
Considering how similar the NFL’s repeated and stubborn denial of a link between football and concussions (they finally admitted to it last week, 11 years after Omalu first published his findings on CTE) were to the tobacco industry’s claims that smoking does not lead to lung disease, the connection between the two institutions comes as little surprise.
In this light, Cravens loses credence. His admission that Concussion might change his opinion on player safety — but at the same time refusing to watch it — is like a smoker picking up a pamphlet outlining the effects of smoking on lung health and tossing it in the trash without looking at it.
Smoking is not against the law, and no one is trying to ban football. The difference is that one activity is taboo while the other is by far the most popular sport in America. I’m not asking that players quit football; just that they should be more informed.
Players need to be better versed on what exactly the effects of football are on their bodies, their brain and their future. They need warnings — like on prescription medication — explicitly stating that playing football could lead to X, Y and Z. They need to know that participating in the sport could cut short their life expectancy and make their final years miserable.
The problem is, with CTE only recently gaining acceptance and the public just starting to become aware of the issues, we still don’t know the full scope of what football does to a player’s health. The onus is on the NFL to take charge and protect its players, but much like the tobacco industry, there is little chance the league would want to do damage its own multi-billion dollar industry.
The connection between the NFL and Big Tobacco leads to another point: The league does not want to become like the tobacco industry. Even if they know the truth, they will do all they can to hide or mitigate it, fearful that it will bring about a mass exodus and public shaming to the sport. Can you imagine the league requiring all 32 teams to tape a sign in the locker rooms reading, “CAUTION: Playing football is dangerous to your health and may cause death from CTE and other diseases”?
That may be extreme, but it’s what the NFL should be doing: informing, educating and updating players on what they know and what they are trying to find out, opening up an honest dialogue between themselves, their players and the public. And, if after that, players like Cravens weigh the risks against the rewards and decide they still want to play football, that’s completely fine.

Jazz-steeped electronica, MIDI-based melodies, Middle Eastern funk, hazy noise pop, surf rock and straight-up girl power will all find a literal common ground on Saturday in McCarthy Quad. Featuring headliner Taylor McFerrin and bands Mansions on the Moon, Tennis System, Vox Waves, Lindy Vision, Midnight Darling and Bazaar Ensemble, this year’s KXSC Fest, put on by KXSC Student Radio, will be a show to remember.
The Daily Trojan had a chance to interview show organizer Liana Wertman, general manager of KXSC Student Radio, regarding the station’s preparation and vision for KXSC Fest 2016.
Daily Trojan: How are you feeling about the event, with only a few days to go?
Liana Wertman: I’m feeling surprisingly calm about the whole event. Months of work have gone into this, dozens of people have had a hand in it, countless emails have been written, and the week of it finally feels like everything is really coming together.
DT: What’s the order of events for planning an event of this magnitude?
LW: This is a year-long process. We picked the date in May and started looking for artists in the fall. Since we got back in January, we’ve had extra weekly meetings, been getting contracts through for artists, been ordering all of the supplies and parts to make KXSC Fest happen. The last two months have been the craziest but right now — week of — is all the final details — making sure everything’s in place to have a smooth day.
DT: How is the Fest funded?
LW: KXSC Student Radio is recognized as a student organization. We don’t get any regular funding from USC but have the same access to funding as any other student organization. We held a fundraiser in December and raised $5,500 from our listeners to help us pay for [this year’s festival] artists. We’ve found amazing local vendors who want to support us, but most of our money is coming from [the Undergraduate Student Government] and [the Graduate Student Government]. We’re very lucky they understood our vision and are sponsoring us by fully funding our request.
DT: What’s your artist selection process like?
LW: We spent the whole fall looking for artists. Our staff, guided by our Concerts Director Alex Spring, looks for the best new music in our area and tries to find the people coming out with really interesting music. Our artists range from amazing student bands like Bazaar Ensemble to largely recognized names like Taylor McFerrin. We look for people who really care about their art and, of course, who make incredible music. We’re very lucky to have gotten the artists we have this year.  In the past we’ve had DJ Dodger Stadium, Flying Lotus, Jesse Lanza, Nosaj Thing, Dan Deacon and so many other amazing artists.
DT: How are you planning to differentiate this event from past years’ Fests?
LW: Our music changes every year. We’re looking for the best up-and-coming artists out there, so the music changes with each act, let alone each year. But we’re also bringing in great vendors, a tie-dye station form one of our sponsors, and, for those of us who are of age, there will be a beer garden.
DT: What is the atmosphere you’re hoping for, and was that considered when you picked artists?
LW: We hope KXSC Fest is a space you arrive at and don’t want to leave. With a relaxed atmosphere, fun activities, great people and amazing music, we want this to be a lovely Saturday afternoon for students and attendees. The music this year certainly reflects that [atmosphere], with a variety of musical genres, waves of different energies and a lot to dance to with your friends.
DT: You mentioned there would be vendors — is there a lot to look forward to in addition to the music?
LW: I’m really looking forward to our food trucks and vendors. I love getting to walk around and meet people who make L.A. what it is — filled with amazing food and creativity. Walking by Record Parlor while eating an ice cream sandwich from Coolhaus and listening to Tennis System — what could be better than that?
DT: What are you hoping people walk away with from this event?
LW: I hope people walk away with an incredible Saturday under their belts. But also, I hope our attendees see the amount of love and passion put into this event by the student at KXSC Student Radio. And that they keep interacting with us. We have over 50 shows on air each week [on our website], we put on monthly concerts and we’re looking for new students to intern and become DJs every semester. We’re also having our annual spring fundraiser starting April 4 and hope free events like KXSC Fest will encourage people to donate and help us continue to do what we love here at USC and for the USC community.
Those who are interested can keep up with news about KXSC Fest on Facebook and on KXSC Student Radio’s website. The Fest starts at 3 p.m. and will feature vendors like Kogi BBQ, Replay Vintage Sunglasses, Coolhaus, The Bootleg Theater, I Must Draw and more. A student ID is required for entry.

This past Tuesday, hip-hop lost Malik Taylor — the original funky diabetic, the five-foot assassin, Dr. Pepper himself, also known as Phife Dawg from the group A Tribe Called Quest — died as a result of complications of diabetes. He was 45. Hip-hop lost a true legend that day, and his influence on many of the rappers and producers today range from The Beastie Boys to Pharrell Williams.
Phife took more of a background role for the first album that the group released, People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, his most notable verse on the track “Can I Kick It?” which had Phife having fun over a sample of Lou Reed’s “Walk on the Wild Side.” He was truly amateurish; his delivery shows his inexperience at the time, but this quick, 16-bar verse unraveled the blueprints for the icon he would soon become, as noted by his launch to popularity on the universally acclaimed record The Low End Theory.
From there on, he continued to innovate new sounds and inspire those around him, as well as gain respect as an artist in his own right. His journey as a kid from Linden Boulevard to chart-topping MC in just two studio albums is something that all artists aspire to do. Many rappers take at least twice the amount of time that Phife did to get their rhymes, timing, delivery and tone individualized. Phife was an instrumental member of the group that rocked the nation and was considered as one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time.
Known for his clever wordplay and the contrast his high-pitched rough voice had with Q-Tip’s smoother tone, he was gruff with his lyrics, not only in his delivery, but also within the lyrics themselves.
“He brought the street to A Tribe Called Quest,” said Chris Lighty, the group’s former manager, in a documentary about the group called Beats, Rhymes & Life. One minute he could be giving listeners a “funky introduction” to what a nice guy he was, and then flipped the bird to any MCs he didn’t respect.
He may have been rough around the edges, but never to the point that it compromised the sounds of his music. Songs like “Jazz (We’ve Got)” and “Check the Rhime” showcased Phife’s ability to casually stay in the pocket of the beat with just enough of an edge to keep listeners on their toes and hang on to every word he had to say. Meanwhile, he could let loose on other tracks like “Scenario” and “Buggin’ Out,” complete with a style that is more on the attack than the more mellow songs he’s on and crude but clever lyrics that prove he deserves the “Dawg” in his nickname.
Unfortunately, like with most successful groups, A Tribe Called Quest split up, and he pursued a solo career while keeping up with his love of sports. It was also during this time that his Type 1 diabetes grew worse, eventually received a kidney transplant from his wife. He also kept a rocky but friendly relationship with his former partner Q-Tip, and the two would talk about anything but music. It was easy to see that their relationship had been strained throughout the years, no longer having that child-like nature to it like they had when they first started. Despite this, they were working out their differences and still had the occasional tour every now and then.
“Malik was our loving husband, father, brother and friend,” the official statement from Taylor’s family and manager said. “His love for music and sports was only surpassed by his love of God and family.”
Taylor was a true man of great character, in and out of the studio, and, most importantly, he was Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation.

I fiddle with the volume as my dad’s BMW slides toward the 110 South on-ramp. My black leggings are covered in dusty paw prints and white fur, remnants of Finley, the therapy cat. Of course, Finley doesn’t have a degree, and I wouldn’t suggest full-time use of his tiny little ears in place of a therapist. Rather, he’s my sister’s three-and-a-half month old kitten who was thrust into the job of calming me down as I bawled my eyes out.
Music blares through the  speakers and guttural noises from my throat puncture the last word of each line. As the most relevant lines come, my voice gets louder, and I begin to unravel into a mess once again. We’re on our way to the movies, hoping that two hours of a kid’s film will keep me calm enough to catch my breath.
I can’t remember a time in my life before I struggled with depression and anxiety. It’s a battle I fought with a small army of friends, my parents and most importantly, music.
I’m a huge proponent of all music being important. All music having a time and a place. But for me, music with sincere messages of hope and strength have always been closest to my heart.
When I lived in New York freshman year, my struggle was at its peak. Rather than an hour-and-a-half drive, my parents had a costly five-hour plane ride to reach me, and I was often left on my own during the worst episodes — or at least physically alone. With a pair of white headphones and a fully charged phone, I always found my army behind me. I would set out with nothing in my pockets but my phone and my keys for a daily walk that would last over 100 blocks (stupid, as I’d always need a drink or a bathroom but never had the money). I would switch on Spotify, choose my album, and march like an 18th-century army nearing the battleground.
I would be lost in a sea of strangers surrounded by concrete buildings and way too much scaffolding. There was something comforting about being in the most populated city in the nation, out in the open, crying and struggling to breathe, without a single person noticing or stopping to look. For that year, music became quite literally my only solace. When my depression told me the only thing I could do was hide in my bed in the dark and my anxiety told me the only thing I could do was be out with my friends trying to function, I was pulled apart by this contradiction. Somehow, walking from tip to tip of Manhattan with my music at full volume satisfied both demons on my shoulder.
While things haven’t been quite as bad as New York since I left, I’ve had to draft my soldiers throughout the past two years. This past month, it all culminated once more when I saw fences rise around me trapping me where I once was. As it all hit me, I realized that this time. There was no city to blame; it was me. I didn’t know if I could call on my army. There seemed to be no external enemy to fight. I had created my own problems this time when I didn’t trust someone close to me, I put myself in a professional position that was exhausting me and I became someone I wasn’t — a fragile thing dependent on others. Could music still help me when I was what I needed to fight against? I became scared. It ate at me. I didn’t know how to fight as a one-man army.
But as I put on my normal playlist for anxiety, I realized that music is a versatile thing. It adapts just like I needed to. My army was still there and just as ready to fight as always. So now as I return to being the quick-witted, clever girl able to make anyone feel better by embarrassing myself and ready to be trusted, my soundtrack of soldiers fight beside me. Just as they will you, if you ever need them.

The men’s volleyball team resumed MPSF play Thursday night with a four-set loss to No. 5 Stanford at Maples Pavilion.
Since their last MPSF outing two weeks ago, the Trojans had won two straight against Concordia and Holy Names. Their aim was to build off that momentum tonight, but they fell flat out of the gates in Palo Alto.
Stanford took the match in four sets (25-16, 25-23, 23-25, 25-30) and they seemed to be in control the whole time. First-team All-MPSF middle and hopeful MPSF player of the year senior Conrad Kaminski rattled USC with a team-high 11 kills and .611 hitting percentage. He put an exclamation mark on his performance with an impressive over-the-shoulder reverse kill in the fourth set. 
Stanford did not play perfectly, though, and they would have appeared vulnerable if USC had brought its A-game. The Cardinal (16-3, 14-3 MPSF) hit a dismal .040 in set three and only marginally raised that percentage in set four. Rather, they won the match at the net and behind the service line. Stanford shared 26 block assists to USC’s 12, and their 10 aces to 14 service errors speak to their serving prowess.
The Trojans (6-15, 4-13 MPSF) haphazardly served themselves a loss, putting up just 3 aces to 27 service errors. Head coach Jeff Nygaard talked to the team this week about aiming for a 1:3 ace to error ratio, but the 1:9 ratio was not what they were seeking. USC’s 27 service errors handed Stanford over a fourth of its points for the match without the Cardinal even having to touch the ball.
This many errors this late in the season spells doom for the Trojans. With only five games left in MPSF play, they are not mathematically eliminated from the MPSF Tournament, but they essentially have to win out to earn the eighth seed. USC will be favored in only one remaining match (against UC San Diego) and the Trojans still have to travel to No. 6 Pepperdine and No. 3 BYU and play No. 14 UC Irvine at home.
The Trojans rotated in four freshman and sophomores today, but they still have not found that magic lineup. Tonight they fielded two setters, six outsides, and two middles – one of whom, senior John Kirchner, has only started a handful of matches all season. 
All year, both players and coaches have chalked up losses to overthinking and mental lapses. 
“We’re all good volleyball players here and I think we’ve been overthinking a lot of things this season,” captain senior libero Brooks Varni said before the match.
He was confident that with a consistent lineup, the wrinkles would be ironed out. Thursday night, though, the Trojans overthought from the service line as much as any other match this season.
Errors have cost the Trojans several matches in MPSF play. USC has the talent to win against any team in the nation, but the focus has not been consistent enough within matches to outcompete more experienced teams.

Students and local officials alike gathered around Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Thursday to catch a glimpse of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s first campus appearance at USC this election cycle. She and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti met with an exclusive group of student leaders and faculty to discuss terrorism prevention. Although not a campaign rally, Clinton supporters excitedly waited outside the tall glass doors of the campus center and formed a long standby line to gain access to the event. To Clinton supporters, the few, solemn pro-Bernie protesters or those who proudly identify as none of the above, Clinton’s presence meant something.
The California primary is months away, and yet both Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have already made appearances in Los Angeles. Be it Clinton’s debut at USC or Sanders’ energizing rally at the Wiltern, one thing is clear: California is going to be an important state in this year’s presidential primaries.
With 475 delegates at stake, California stands a strong chance of making a difference for both candidates. If Sanders fares reasonably well on the East Coast and throughout the territories, winning a solid majority in California might mean narrowing the gap between himself and Clinton to 70 or so delegates — a huge improvement from where his current position, roughly 300 delegates in Clinton’s rear-view mirror. For Clinton, winning big in California could mean the end of her worries — an undeniable springboard to the nomination. At that point, one might be able to safely call Sanders’ race a lost one. So, no matter if you support Clinton or Sanders or how wide the gap may seem or how safe your candidate appears — come June 7, it’ll be time to turn out.
The delegate system works thus: 475 delegates of California’s ultimate total 548 are pledged delegates, meaning their vote must coincide with primary results. An important 158 of those delegates will be pledged based on the vote statewide, rather than on the basis of individual districts — that’s 158 delegates to whoever takes the state.
California could very well turn out to be a good race for Sanders — the state boasts a record number of large college campuses. Sanders is favored in Silicon Valley and polls well with working-class Democrats, many of whom call California home.
On the other hand, we can observe Hillary’s long-time favor among affluent Democrats and Hispanics — both who are concentrated up and down the coast and throughout southern and central California. She’s polling ahead of Sanders in some counties, and draws support from constituencies with historically reliable turnout. Despite the millennial concentrations among universities, Clinton may not have much to fear from the California primary.
So it’s not surprising to see that both candidates are putting in face time with California in these early stages — especially the Los Angeles area. In primaries past, the delegate deficit between the two candidates has usually been large enough to discount California. Neither purple nor front-loaded, Californians might once have had to consider themselves virtually unnoticeable in the primaries, other than their massive delegate count.
But this election season has diverged from all traditional logic and sensibilities. One-third of Republican frontrunners in January had no prior political experience or legal training. The currently favored GOP candidate pursues the complex foreign policy platform of a really, really big wall. Meanwhile, a self-avowed democratic socialist just took Kansas and Oklahoma by very comfortable margins. November’s on the horizon; time to ride it out.
It comes down to this: A few apolitical and yet stridently self-assured college students will take great joy in haughtily informing you that the election doesn’t matter because your vote doesn’t count. They took 11th-grade civics and learned that California’s really big and blue, and therefore, they are excused from paying attention. Luckily for American democracy, they’re very wrong.
Even to the Republican party, in which Donald Trump has presented a historic upset, California’s primary might turn the tide against a Trump presidency. The difference between a Clinton or a Sanders run against Donald Trump or Ted Cruz will be a monumental one. The general election will be decisive, and its fate will be chosen now, in the primaries. There’s plenty at stake and much to be gained — and lost — for both Clinton and Sanders. Every delegate is about to count.
So, red or blue, whether You’re With Her or Feeling the Bern, if you believe in the political self-determination which all U.S. citizens are promised, exercise your civil right and civic duty: Vote.

A quick conversation with a Resident Assistant will reveal just how many health-related items students can receive for free. Amenities include sunscreens, hand sanitizers and condoms, among other useful products, to support the wellness of the USC community. But disappointingly, one thing remains hidden from the list — feminine hygiene products.
Across the United States, women are being taxed for being women. In an overwhelming 40 states, feminine hygiene products are considered luxury items. California is one of these states. Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia recently presented a bill to end this so-called tampon tax, citing in a press release that it costs women $7 a month for a span of 40 years simply to manage inevitable biological processes. Needless to say, women spend excessive amounts of money buying feminine hygiene products during their lifetimes. Not to mention, other products associated with menstruation, such as pain-relieving medication, heating pads and birth control, add significantly to the cost as well.
With students already shouldering the financial burden of the inflated cost of living in Los Angeles on top of continuous increases in the University’s already costly tuition, it is unfair to force female students to pay an even bigger price tag for circumstances outside of their control. Denying female students free access to feminine hygiene products in campus housing and university restrooms sends the message that these products are not essential. This essentially perpetuates society’s stigmatization of menstruation. If women need feminine hygiene products, they have to go elsewhere. This continues the trend of women hiding or being ashamed of their menstruation due to stereotypes surrounding the effect it has on women’s behavior. By failing to make the products used during menstruation easily accessible, the process is further seen as unnatural or something that has no place on the University grounds.
This is intensely problematic. Without proper feminine hygiene products, female students would find their classroom experiences severely impeded for one week of every month. Lack of access to these products doesn’t just make college more expensive for female students, but could also potentially jeopardize the education they are receiving.
Each semester, female students spend between three and five weeks per semester menstruating. That is anywhere from 20 to 30 percent of each semester. The rate of one tampon or pad change every six hours translates to 28 per week, or up to 140 per semester. This is just the minimum requirement to cope with the demands of menstruation. Feminine hygiene products are not a luxury. By not offering free access, the University is ignoring a common experience of more than half of its student body.
Instead, USC should look to examples led by efforts across the United States that are focused on integrating free access to tampons and sanitary pads in public spaces. Earlier last month in New York City, members of the city council initiated a pilot program in Queens in which a high school bathroom was supplied with unrestricted access to tampons and pads. The project is due to expand to 25 other schools in the area. Of the program’s mission, Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, the leader of the initiative, said, “You don’t ration toilet paper or ask for permission for more toilet paper. You shouldn’t have to for these products.”
By offering students free and unlimited access to feminine hygiene products, the University will be taking a stand both against the stigma of menstruation and for a more gender-equal, inclusive campus environment. Female students should not have to feel as if taking care of their normal biological processes is a luxury, and the University should not treat it as such.
All university restrooms on campus should be equipped with free feminine hygiene products, but at the very least, they should be more readily available. The University owes that courtesy to its female population. It is not a luxury — it is a basic human right.
Daily Trojan Spring 2016 Editorial Board
Honey, did your Daddy ever ask you why tuition goes up every year?
Paula Swinford, Director of the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion would like
you to know…
In room 203 of the Engemann Student Health Center, feminine hygiene products are as free as the sunscreen, ear plugs, bike lights, and sleep masks, etc. They many not be paid-for or taxed
out-of-pocket as a consumable commodity, but they are all paid for through a small portion of the Student Health and Wellness Fee. This semesterly Fee provides support for enhancing population health, so every student may know wellness in person, place, and planet.  
Suggestions for other supplies anyways welcome, contact owhp@usc.edu. Thank you. Paula

For my most recent donut adventure, I explored arguably the most visited donut place in Los Angeles — Randy’s Donuts. You’ve probably seen photos of the small shop dating back to 1953 when it was founded, or perhaps you recognize it from the scene in Iron Man 2 where Tony Stark casually sits on the building. Conveniently located near LAX — and easily spotted by the oversized donut that crowns its roof — Randy’s has been an ideal photo-op site for tourists and locals alike. That being said, however, it is known primarily for its fame on camera — and not so much for the quality of its donuts.
Like any donut shop that was founded before the 21st century, Randy’s consists of solely classic donut flavors. That’s a rarity in the sea of trendy shops that have opened in recent years. As a foodie, I typically prefer trying out-of-the-ordinary flavors, but nonetheless, I resorted to an all-time favorite: the old-fashioned chocolate glaze donut. 
Even though the version at Krispy Kreme will always hold a special place in my heart, I’ll admit that Randy’s did a stand-up job of meeting my standards. They weren’t the best, but I appreciated the fact that they did not go overboard on the frosting. This is what I call a nice dough-to-frosting ratio!
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
For my second donut, I opted for the plain cruller donut. Of the two that I tried, this one was my least favorite because it was just too dry for my taste. Since it didn’t have any frosting and I chose the plain version of it, the donut turned out be exactly that: plain. Though I would consider it more of a bread than a donut, I’m a huge fan of all carbs, so I can’t complain.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
As I mentioned before, Randy’s is known for its presence in numerous films, not its donuts, so I would only recommend visiting for the experience of visiting a landmark in Los Angeles. There’s plenty of parking if you want to stop and take photos. You could also just swing by on your way to the airport; they also have an efficient drive-through that wraps around the building. 
Regardless of how you choose to order your donuts, you will definitely be able to feel the history of Hollywood film at this old-fashioned donut shop.
Randy’s Donuts is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 805 W. Manchester Boulevard, Inglewood, CA 90301.

Hip-hop has lost an icon that will never be replaced. Rapper Malik Taylor, also known as Phife Dawg, passed away this past Tuesday at the age of 45. When music loses a visionary like this, every artist knows that their brilliance will never grace music again, and Taylor is certainly no exception.
For those who are unfamiliar with Taylor, he goes by many names — the five-foot assassin and the funky diabetic, just to name a few. He was part of the legendary hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, which featured the talents of rapper/MC Phife Dawg, rapper/MC Q-Tip, DJ/producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad and rapper/MC Jarobi White, who left in 1991. A Tribe Called Quest was a New York-based group that quickly rose to prominence in the late ’80s, but Taylor wouldn’t get the spotlight until later.
People in the underground circles of hip-hop began to take note of his name after a few verses on the group’s first album, People’s Instinctive Travels and the Path’s of Rhythm, most notably on the song “Can I Kick It?” He was certainly new to rapping, since his lyrics and delivery were all very undeveloped in the 16-bar verse, but impressive nonetheless for someone as young as him. Make no mistake; he was just warming up.
What followed after was Taylor’s rise to one of the kings of rap in the ’90s with the release of the group’s universally acclaimed album, The Low End Theory. Taylor had matured, not only in age, but in his craft as well. His lyrics were tighter, wittier and more thoughtful, while his delivery was well-developed, perfectly timed and precise. He showed a new level of confidence that truly made him an equal to the other hip-hop titan of the group, Q-Tip. 
The two created a sound that would separate them from the rest of the competition. Taylor’s voice was high-pitched and gruff, and his delivery leaned toward an assertive style with rough lyrics, characteristics that served as the perfect contrast to Q-Tip’s mellow voice that flowed like no other. Taylor never compromised the smoother sound of the songs he was on, and he was able to keep the yin and yang between him and Q-Tip consistent while still managing to put just enough edge in the songs to keep listeners interested. 
Songs like “Check the Rhime,” “Vibes and Stuff” and “Jazz (We’ve Got)” are key examples of Taylor showcasing his range on calmer songs. It’s impossible not to bob your head to “Jazz (We’ve Got)” when Taylor lays down his rhymes. The call and response of “You on point Phife?/All the time Tip” in “Check the Rhime” is one of the most iconic moments of not just the group’s discography, but hip-hop as a whole.
In some cases, Taylor manages to outshine Q-Tip, something that was long overdue on some songs. His solo songs — “Butter” from The Low End Theory, “8 Million Stories” from Midnight Marauders and “Baby Phife’s Return” from the group’s album Beats, Rhymes & Life — prove that Phife has enough skills to branch off on his own. He also upstages Q-Tip a few times on shared songs on their albums. On The Low End Theory, Taylor has the best verse on “Scenario,” including a very crude but witty line that proves he shouldn’t be taken lightly. On Midnight Marauders, Taylor makes good use of his evolved talents on “Keep it Rollin’,” which includes a Barney reference, is miles ahead of Q-Tip on “Lyrics to Go” and does a great job of coasting on the beat of “God Lives Through.” He makes it known to other MCs that he’s the baddest of them all on the song “The Pressure” off of Beats, Rhymes and Life, and on the group’s final album, The Love Movement, he goes out with a bang with a couple of great verses in the songs “Find a Way” and “Busta’s Lament.”
Taylor’s legacy will not be forgotten, since he’s influenced so many rappers and producers ahead of his time that are icons in their own right. Taylor had a great impact on the careers of big name artists such as The Roots and Pharrell Williams. He’s had an incredible career that has cemented him as one of hip-hop’s greatest MCs with a reputation will live for a long time. 
Wherever the five-foot assassin with the roughneck business is, may he rest in beats.

Nearly four years ago, I visited L.A. for the very first time and decided I would attend USC. I knew next to nothing about the West Coast besides the fact that it was much sunnier than where I grew up in Connecticut. I had never been to In-N-Out and had no idea what my neighbor in New/North meant when she said she was from the “Bay Area.” 
Now, four years later, I’ve had more than my fair share of animal-style fries and am slightly obsessed with San Francisco. I’m still not sure if I’m staying on the West Coast next year or if I’m heading back East, but in the meantime, here are some things I’ve learned about the West Coast versus the East Coast over the past four years.

The minute the clock hits 3:45 p.m., I shove everything into my backpack and make a beeline out of class and down the six-and-a-half-billion stairs that lead from the University of Cape Town to the main road. Although the idea of erecting a university on a mountainside turned out to be a gorgeous idea, it really does take a toll on the butt of a sucker that needs to head down to civilization. But I don’t mind because every Monday and Wednesday after class, I get to go to my favorite place, a growing center of my universe, the Langa Quarter. 
Langa is considered a “township,” the word used to describe the living spaces designated for black and Coloured people during the apartheid. Many townships are lacking in development in some way: Some only have outdoor bathrooms; some have dismal electricity; some can only be described as shacks. I decided to volunteer with iKhaya le Langa (House of the Sun), an entrepreneurial space in the heart of Langa Quarter.
Upon arrival, Tony, the man in charge of directing volunteers, immediately made some things clear. “We aren’t here to alleviate poverty. We’re here to develop business. Langa doesn’t need sympathy,” Tony said.
Outside the walls of street art and happy running kids that give Langa its color stands a wall that literally and physically divides Langa from Pinelands, a white neighborhood. Instead of protesting (a popular way of enacting change in South Africa), Tony has plans to make Langa so exciting and “#trending” that people will start seeing it as the center of Cape Town, and the wall will come down on its own.

The projects at work are something out of a hundred dreams. Chandeliers are stashed in an empty community room, waiting to be hung up in the community bathroom. Hotels and homestays are being fashioned out of the homes of the families that live there and are available to tourists or visitors that want a unique living experience. Not to mention, there are plans being formulated around building a community go-kart track around Langa Quarter so that kids could ride around the neighborhood. The answer to all of the questions about this bubbling incubator for ideas is, “Why not?” And to be honest, I can’t think of a reason.
One of the projects in the works that I’m absolutely jazzed about is the building of the Langa Restaurant. Operated by Langa residents, it’s meant to get tourists to visit a township for an experience consisting of more than just hopping out of a bus, taking a million photos and setting captions like “ThisIsAfrica” or whatever. It is meant to get people to sit down, generate some wealth for the township and really learn about the community and how it operates. “The opposite of love is fear. And the only thing that conquers fear is desire,” as Tony says.

That’s not even the best part. In a separate element of the cafe, we are working to create a menu of free food to offer to volunteers and workers in the township. South Africa (as well as L.A., for that matter) has a huge food waste problem. Farms throw away fruits that are perfectly edible but are in an otherwise funky shape. Often, they throw out produce simply because they overproduce. Supermarkets must throw away food by the “sell by” date, even if the “use by” date is days or weeks away. What amasses, then, are huge amounts of perfectly good and healthy foods, rotting in landfills and taxing the environment when it could just as well feed thousands of people. The team I’m on plans to collect this food, come up with a fantastic menu of healthy food options and open it up as a social enterprise within the restaurant.

The beautiful thing about this is that it isn’t charity. Social enterprise is a beautiful, creative way of fitting pieces and people together to make a model that works. There is no place here for a California girl from the other side of the world to run over and paint a library or kiss a child. The developments being made are unapologetic, environmentally sustainable and, in my humble opinion, just gosh darn brilliant.

Author David Horowitz spoke at a meeting of the USC College Republicans Wednesday evening in Taper Hall. Students protested the event due to his rhetoric, which some students consider inflammatory.
Horowitz, who founded the David Horowitz Freedom Center think tank, presented a talk called “Stop the Jew Hatred,” which aimed to educate attendees on anti-Semitism in America and the right of Israel to exert its influence in the Middle East. He also discussed what he saw as the widespread goal of Muslims to wage war against Jews, claiming that a large percentage of Muslims support jihadist acts of terror against the United States.
“[Muslim hatred of Jews] is very open,” Horowitz said. “The difference between Islamic fanatics, or Jew haters, and Hitler is that Hitler hid the Final Solution, and the Iranians and Hezbollah shout it from the rooftops. And the whole Muslim world accepts it.”
Horowitz explained that he believes Palestine has no right to its territory and that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is mainly due to Arab aggression against Jews. He defended earlier statements he had made about the inferiority of Palestinians and claimed that a two-state solution is not possible due to the inherent violence of the Islamic religion.
“The terrorists that blew up the airport in Brussels came from a Muslim neighborhood,” Horowitz said. “You think they didn’t know what was going on? Same with San Bernardino. The mosque is notorious for sponsoring terrorism.”
Horowitz’s arrival on campus incited student protests outside Taper Hall before his speech. Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
Prior to the presentation, a group of students gathered outside of Taper Hall to protest Horowitz’s invitation to speak on campus. Protesters held signs declaring that “anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism” to state that Palestinians who are against Israel did not necessarily hate Jews. They also claimed that Horowitz’s rhetoric was inflammatory and racist, citing his statements that the keffiyeh kerchief worn as a headdress by many Palestinians was a symbol of terrorism as hate speech.
“I’m a Muslim living in America,” said Muhammad Yusuf Tarr, a freshman majoring in broadcast journalism who was protesting Horowitz’s talk. “I see how the people who are noticeably Muslim are treated. I know friends who are afraid of speaking Arabic.”
Horowitz responded to the protesters’ claims by defending his freedom of speech, stating that if students had any serious concerns, they would try to understand why. He also alleged that the attempt to shut down any speech seen as “conservative” reflected the growing global presence of jihadist movements, which silenced opposition in an attempt to grow their own power.
“[Terrorism] silences individual freedom to intimidate people,” Horowitz said. “This is a sinister movement. Why do they want to silence anyone who disagrees with them? That is the only way that they can sustain the lives that feed them.”
Tarr and others, however, believed that Horowitz went beyond exercising his First Amendment rights and actually harmed many of the students in attendance through inflammatory rhetoric.
“This is my University,” Tarr said. “He may have free speech, but I do too, and I don’t want him to come here to an educational institution and continue saying all of these things against many of the people who are here. There is a concept called hate speech, and I believe that he crosses the line when it comes to that.”
Several students in attendance agreed with Horowitz’s viewpoint on his right to speak on campus, although they may not see eye-to-eye with the way he presented his thoughts. Jordan Tygh, a graduate student studying liberal studies, explained that he thought labeling something “hate speech” could potentially be used as a way to silence people whose opinions were simply different from the majority.
“I didn’t agree with [Horowitz’s] tone, but I think that the idea of hate speech is dangerous,” Tygh said. “I can disagree with things that he says, and I have the highest respect for Muslim culture. But everyone should be allowed to speak because that way people can learn critical thinking.”
Horowitz previously spoke at USC in November 2009, an event that also drew criticism from student groups such as the Students for Justice in Palestine and the Muslim Student Union. In that event, protesters were escorted from the room by Department of Public Safety officers.
Horowitz is a blowhard fool. Who is inviting such poor, sub-par speakers? Couldn’t we have smarter, more informative conservative speakers on campus? USC is an educational institution and if we don’t provide smart, conservative voices on campus- and only invite clowns like Breitbart people, Horowitz, and Ann Coulter- then no one ever has to leave their liberal bubble. Shame on Ellenhorn and other of the Know-Nothing Republicans. Time for new leadership.
Horowitz is speaking what is an inconvenient truth. Muslim students decry it as hate speech against them, yet the resurgence of anti-Semitism in the US is focused on our college campuses. The new anti-Semitism is not coming from neo-Nazis or skin heads, but the pro-Palestinian movement on campus.
As a part-time teacher at UC Irvine (and a Gentile), I have seen it and heard it first hand for years now. Nobody is trying to stop legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. The problem is that all too often, it crosses the line into Jew hatred.
In 2001, an imam from Washington DC named Mohamad al Asi told an audience at UCI that ” You can take the Jew out of the ghetto, but you can’t take the ghetto out of the Jew”. In 2008, the MSU at UCI put up a caricature of Ariel Sharon on their mock “Apartheid wall” that was drawn in the stereotypical style of the Nazi weekly Der Stuermer. Swastikas have appeared on several UC campuses over the tears, most recently twice in the past year at UC Davis. Jewish students on campuses all over the country have been subjected to taunts, bullying and intimidation. Guess where it comes from: The various Muslim Student Association chapters and Students for Justice in Palestine, a Brown Shirt organization founded by UC Berkeley professor Hatem Bazian.
Horowitz’s “sin” is that he not only talks about the offenses, he names the perpetrators.
One protestor said:  “I see how the people who are noticeably Muslim are treated. I know friends who are afraid of speaking Arabic.”
I’d like to meet those people who are so afraid.  A Muslim colleague of mine told me how beautifully treated when he had to travel frequently to rural Kentucky after 9/11.    If someone mistreats Muslims based upon appearance alone, I’m against  it.  However, the treatment of non-Muslims in the Islamic world is abhorrent.  Go the Pew Research Survey of Attitudes of Muslims and see the percentage of Muslims (well over 50% in many places such as  Egypt) that support the death penalty those who  leave Islam.
I suggest it is far more moral for these protesters to be upset by the defaming of the Muslim religion by Muslims that practice widespread hatred and violence  and spend energy to change those attitudes rather than protesting the freedom of David Horowitz, a former leftist, to speak..

Vice Provost for Academic and Faculty Affairs Elizabeth Graddy and Vice Provost for Graduate Programs Sally Pratt announced a new initiative to increase diversity and create a more inclusive culture in USC graduate schools Wednesday. The Graduate Initiative for Diversity, Inclusion and Access also aims to recruit a wider range of graduate students from groups that are underrepresented.
The initiative is divided into three sections which approach different issues surrounding increasing graduate diversity. The first section will establish a stipend of $32,000 starting in fall 2017, which will help fund students selected for graduate programs. This funding will either be added to an existing fellowship from the graduate school or from the graduate school or program as part of the “top-offs” program already in place.
The second part of the initiative enacts the “DIA JumpStart Program,” a recruiting program which will be introduced on a smaller scale in the summer of 2016. This program aims to increase the pool of possible applicants so that USC graduate programs receive a more diverse set of applicants. This summer, the program will provide students at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, California State University, Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University with a research-intensive summer program at USC.
The research experience will combine mentoring and research training with activities that address the lack of diversity in academic settings. The three universities selected for participation are institutions with significant minority populations. According to the provost, the program hopes to see an increase in applications from these students following the first program.
The final part of the initiative creates a series of camps and events for students. First is the “DIA Boot Camp,” a 10-day workshop in the summer for incoming and first-year PhD students applying for fellowships such as the Ford Pre-Doctoral, GEM or Soros fellowship. Following in the fall are the “DIA Boot Camp Boosters,” a series of one-day workshops for the students who graduated from the summer boot camp.
In these sessions, students will continue to pursue outside scholarships and work on a variety of professional and academic skills, along with building a community with their fellow PhD students. Supplementing these workshops will be a series of professional networking events for students to gain professional contacts.
The initiative’s first steps will take place in summer and will expand in continuing years.
