A little more than a year ago, the USC campus was left stunned after the stabbing death of one of its own students — the first incident in a string of high-profile crimes that plagued the school last year.
But despite that incident and a number of other crimes that grabbed the attention of students, parents and the national media, the Department of Public Safety’s annual crime report — released today — indicates an overall drop in crime on and around campus.
According to the new crime report, USC experienced a drop in robberies, which are down 51 percent, aggravated assault, down 13 percent and motor vehicle thefts, down 14 percent. In contrast, the school saw a rise in forcible sex offenses, up 300 percent, and burglaries, up 21 percent.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said the high-profile crimes that received the most attention last year, including a shooting and a stabbing, were exceptions.
“Of course these are exceptional crimes, and, justifiably, received a lot of media attention,” Carlisle said. “However, while these headlines led to the public perception that crime was on the rise around USC, in fact the opposite is true. Crime has been on the decline for the last few years and that trend is continuing.”
According to the new statistics from DPS, USC saw the most significant decrease in robberies, which fell from 39 in 2007 to 19 to 2008. Aggravated assaults fell from 16 to 14, motor vehicle theft from 36 to 31 and arson from three to zero.
Some types of crime, however, increased in 2008.
Burglaries rose from 71 to 86 and forcible sex offenses rose from three to 12.
The statistics were released today as part of a yearly DPS crime report that follows the guidelines of the Clery Act, which requires universities to give timely crime alerts and issue crime statistics annually. According to Carlisle, the Clery Act also determines the parameters of the school, so the extent of crime in that area can be reported and compared in a consistent manner among universities around the country.
Those parameters, however, result in the exclusion of some crimes from the report. This year, the predetermined boundaries meant two of the most highly publicized crimes were left off.
Though cinema student Bryan Frost was fatally stabbed in September, no murders were reported on the 2008 report.
According to Carlisle, this was because the incident occurred on Orchard Avenue, which is outside the boundaries defined by the Clery Act.
“There were two highly publicized crimes last year, the stabbing death of a USC student and the shooting in the legs of a USC track athlete,” Carlisle said. “The location where Bryan Frost was murdered was not within Clery boundaries, so while we recognize the fact that a USC student was murdered, it is not included in these campus crimes.”
Even though the Clery Report leaves out some areas near campus, DPS is confident crime numbers are down all around the school, just as crime is down in Los Angeles as a whole.
According to LAPD’s 2009 crime report, which was released Sept. 21, there has been significantly less violent crime and property crime so far in 2009 compared to the same period last year. Additionally, homicide in Los Angeles is down 23.5 percent, violent crimes have dropped 10 percent and property crimes have declined 11 percent.
Carlisle attributes the decrease in crime around USC to the crime fighting and prevention strategies USC has employed in recent years.
“The addition of new personnel to DPS as well as security ambassadors and technologies have helped the issue, particularly the deployment strategies that we’ve put into place over the past three years, which reflect those of LAPD Chief Bratton,” Carlisle said.
LAPD Officer Corri of the Southwest Division said that at least two officers are assigned to the USC area daily and that visual presence and specialized programs such as gang injunctions have assisted in the decrease of crime in the area.
“We’ve got gang injunctions in place, which puts gang members in jail and also teaches a lesson to people wanting to commit crimes, letting them know they will be arrested,” Corri said.
DPS Crime Prevention Specialist Wyman Thomas added that, apart from new personnel, DPS’s success is also a result of the use of Computer Analysis of Crime Statistics, or COMSTAT, a method for compiling crime statistics for comparison.
“We employ and continue to strategize based on trends,” Thomas said. “We review COMSTAT every week, and we look at what is taking place in the community in terms of events, or transient population, and we allocate those resources and deploy our officers in those areas.”
Some students said they have noticed the increase in crime prevention efforts by DPS.
Laura Escobar-Vallecillo, a sophomore majoring in communication, lives at the Radisson and said that the increased DPS presence on the streets around campus has made a noticeable difference.
“I feel like late at night when I’m crossing the street it’s been a lot safer this year than last year because I see a lot of DPS officers,” Escobar-Vallecillo said.
But other students said they have never thought of campus as an unsafe place.
“I never thought that crime was that bad in the first place,” said Marshall Ge, a freshman majoring in biological sciences. “Even though all my friends told me USC was really dangerous, I never felt that crime was a big deal.”

During the USC men’s tennis team’s ring ceremony this past Saturday, the 2009 National Champions were recognized for their accomplishments.
Now the team finds itself back at the starting line of a long journey that ended in a national championship last year. The only difference? This year they’re starting out on top.
To recap last season’s run to the title: The team defeated Pac-10 foe Stanford,  along with Texas, No. 1-seeded Virginia and Ohio State. The national title was the program’s 17th and coach Peter Smith’s first.
While the fall competition for the men’s tennis team will primarily be individual tournaments, the results will have an effect on team rankings entering the spring. The fall competition is also an opportunity for the Trojans to improve their individual rankings in both singles and doubles play.
“It is important to start the [spring] season with a good ranking,” senior Robert Farah said.
“Absolutely,” sophomore Steve Johnson agreed.
Already, the team boasts four singles players ranked by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, as well as three ranked doubles teams. No. 3 Farah, No. 18 Johnson, No. 49 junior Jaak Poldma and No. 99 sophomore Matt Kecki all sit among the rankings. Farah and Johnson return as No. 3-ranked doubles partners while Kecki and Poldma come into the rankings at No. 35.
Last season Farah and Johnson played primarily at the number one position and Kecki and Poldma held things down on the third court. That left the second position to sophomore Daniel Nguyen and then-senior Abdullah Magdas. Magdas has since run out of eligibility, but freshman JT Sundling looks to fill his position. Sundling and Nguyen have quite a bit of experience playing together, including a stint at the US Open earlier this month, so the transition is likely to be a smooth one.
“We won Kalamazoo [this summer] and took a set off of a professional team,” Nguyen said of his and Sundling’s success together.
Magdas was the only senior last season so the Trojans should return almost their full lineup along with the additions of freshmen Sundling and Joel Giger. Magdas played a key role in the Trojans’ run to a national championship last season, but these fresh faces provide fresh talent.
“We’re just as good as last year,” Nguyen said. “Maybe even better.”
An experienced team should serve the Trojans well and it’s a far cry from the situation they found themselves in just one year ago. Of the 10 players on the roster entering the 2008 preseason, five were freshmen. A young program, however, did not stop them from enjoying success, as evidenced by the 2009 title.
Coming up for the Trojans is the All-American Qualifying tournament in Tulsa, Okla. The tournament serves as a chance for ranked players to improve their standing and unranked players, like Nguyen and senior Jason McNaughton, to break into the rankings.
“I’m pretty pumped,” Nguyen said. “I want to do well and get a ranking.”
“I want to be a great preseason player,” McNaughton added.
In all, it looks like the Trojans will come back this season just as much of a force and threat, if not more so, than last season with a year of added experience and a national championship under their belts.
Some players feel the national championship takes the pressure away, while others feel the opposite.
“The monkey’s off the back,” Johnson said. “We won a title.”
“We have a target on our back now, but I’m looking forward to the competition,” Nguyen said.
Either way, the Trojans are back and ready for action, and as Smith called them at the conclusion of last season, they are “absolutely the team to beat.”

We all know by now that Stafon Johnson is most likely done for the rest of the season.
He was involved in a tragic accident that no one could have predicted or prevented.
But what we don’t know is how the USC offense will respond to the incident. More specifically, how will this impact the rotation of running backs on the roster?
Four games into the season, the senior Johnson had established himself as USC’s premiere goal-line back. He led the team with five rushing touchdowns and was second on the team with 157 rush yards, an average of 4.9 yards per carry.
He scored the most touchdowns because coach Pete Carroll trusted Johnson with the ball in the red zone and gave the senior more opportunities than any other running back to score when the Trojans were near the end zone.
That trust is now gone.  And even Carroll isn’t sure who will be getting the ball in those situations this Saturday against California.
“We’re working on it,” the coach said in a press conference on Tuesday. “We’ll see what we’re going to do about that.”
Unlike many teams, USC has the luxury of many highly recruited running backs on its roster that could possibly fill the void left by Johnson. There is a list of possible scenarios that could play out when No. 7 USC visits No. 24 Cal this weekend.
Option One: The Joe McKnight Show.
McKnight already leads the team in rush attempts at 47 and rush yards at 362. But the junior is definitely the type of talent that has a chance to produce some gaudy numbers if he takes more handoffs from freshman Matt Barkley.
Without Johnson, McKnight may get the opportunity to take control in the backfield. Although McKnight leads the team in rush attempts, he has only been given the ball to run on 32 percent of USC’s running plays.
That number could now bump up to 35 or even 40 percent if Carroll decides to keep McKnight on the field more because of Johnson’s injury.
Is that too many carries for McKnight to handle?
No.
Cal’s stud running back Jahvid Best has carried the ball 69 times this season and has accounted for 44 percent of the Bears’ running plays.
The question is whether or not Carroll will trust the ball in McKnight’s hands on the five-yard line.
One of McKnight’s biggest weaknesses throughout his time at USC has been ball security. And the last time a coach wants to see his team cough the ball away  is when it’s about to push it in the end zone for six.
Option Two: There Once Was A Man Named Gable.
Remember him?
Back in 2006 as a freshman, C.J. Gable ran 111 times, second on the team to then-redshirt junior Chauncey Washington’s 157 attempts, and gained 434 rush yards, third best on the team. He also scored four touchdowns.
After an injury-plagued 2007 season, Gable returned last season to rush for 617 yards on 107 attempts and scored eight touchdowns — the second highest on the team and only one behind Johnson.
But in 2009, Gable has played in three of the Trojans’ first four games and rushed for just 44 yards on only 10 attempts.
Gable said he was ready to go in the Trojans’ loss to Washington two weeks ago and expressed frustration after not getting any playing time after Trojan running backs continued to fumble the ball away. Carroll, however, said Gable had not recovered from the flu and was not available.
“I want to get in, but I’ve got to wait until whenever my time is,” the running back said following the game.
Maybe now is the time.
Gable ran only three times for two yards against Washington State last Saturday, but without Johnson’s services, Carroll may look back down memory lane.
At 6 feet, 205 pounds, Gable represents a bigger option than McKnight if Carroll wants to pound the ball into the end zone. Carroll also said during Monday’s practice that he would heavily consider giving Gable more opportunities to run from this point forward.
Option Three: Spread The Wealth.
Instead of giving more carries to McKnight or Gable, Carroll can decide to spread the carries out until someone emerges as a solid goal-line running back.
That means guys like redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili, redshirt sophomore tailback Marc Tyler and redshirt junior tailback Allen Bradford will get more chances to show what they can do on the field, especially near the end zone.
Out of that mix, I’d give Bradford the advantage. He’s a bulky running back at 5-foot-11, 235 pounds, and he can move when the ball is in his hands. He also has the best build to pound the ball for short yardage gains — which would be very beneficial near the end zone.
So Carroll clearly has some options to consider when putting together his game plan this weekend. Although we won’t know what he chooses until game time, one thing is clear.
Without Johnson, the Trojans’ backfield is a bit less crowded, but a lot more complicated.

Moving forward after this week’s traumatic event, USC now turns its attention to No. 24 California, whose balanced attack has the Trojans stepping up preparation on both sides of the ball.
The Golden Bears’ pro-style 3-4 defensive alignment is an approach that takes special preparation, but for former Denver Broncos quarterback coach and USC’s current quarterback coach, Jeremy Bates, preparing for the attack is something he’s done before.
Field vision · Matt Barkley will face a 3-4 defense for the first time in his college career when he takes on a Cal team looking to bounce back. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“Their 3-4 is something new, it definitely changes the focus a bit on the offensive side of the ball,” Bates said. “There are many different ways for [the defense] to blitz and pressure the quarterback. In the [NFL] the Patriots and the Chargers run it especially well.”
Coach Pete Carroll also marveled at California’s 3-4 — although complex in formation and execution — mentioning how well the Golden Bears were able to run a defense so intricate and advanced while also running a successful offensive attack.
“The more we look at them, the more we realized how balanced they are as a team — they do everything well,” Carroll said. “They are the lowest penalized team in the conference this season. We’re going to have to stay disciplined.”
Led by quarterback Kevin Riley and running back Jahvid Best, the Bears’ offense features both a strong running and passing game which will put extra strain on the Trojan secondary.
“Our secondary is good, they tackle well and cover well. If Jahvid gets loose, they’ll be our saving grace,” Carroll said.
“Their whole offense is dangerous,” senior safety Taylor Mays said. “They always play us really tough. They know that they can take a shot against us, and they’re not intimidated.”
u
Almost three weeks removed from the injury he suffered against Ohio State, freshman Matt Barkley continued to show improvement during practice.
“Without a question it was the best day for his arm motion,” Carroll said. “It’s still not 100 percent, but even from yesterday to today, he’s better.”
Practicing for the full week knowing he’d be the starter for the first time since before the matchup with the Buckeyes, Barkley impressed quarterbacks coach Bates yet again with his improvement.
“Matt is getting better everyday. He’s throwing better than he’s thrown in the past two weeks,” Bates said.
Redshirt freshman defensive end Nick Perry, the Pac-10 sack leader, returned to practice Wednesday after he was forced to sit out of practice  Tuesday due to a knee bruise.
“It’s [a] great return. He couldn’t even move yesterday,” Carroll said. “It’s a bruised knee. We just have to hope that it doesn’t get banged on, but I’m sure he’ll play on Saturday.”
Junior wide receiver Ronald Johnson also returned to Howard Jones Field yesterday for the first time since he broke his collarbone, but was restricted to running on the side field for the day.

“I don’t eat meat.”
For some reason, these five words can incite an array of emotions: animated nods of approval, haughty snorts of condemnation, or even the puzzled furrows of brows. Vegetarianism seems to be strange to many but finds a welcome home in Los Angeles.
So what exactly is the decision to not eat meat? Is it a practice, a religion? Perhaps it is even a health decision or a simple choice made by a finicky 3-year-old averse to all things chewy.
No matter the reason, this way of life has become a part of the LA stereotype: a trendy, quasi-progressive way to avoid calories.
Vegetarianism, however, is a legitimate movement. Zel and Reuben Allen, editors of web magazine Vegetarians in Paradise, have spent 11 years listing vegetarian, vegan and vegetarian-friendly restaurants for a public that demands to know where they can eat without meat. The pair has listed more than 165 locations boasting more than 125,000 visitors a month.
Zel credits the proximity of produce to Los Angeles as an encouragement for the veggie-friendly vibe of the city, where the Allens have lived as a couple for more than 20 years. They are in their 21st year of being vegan, and they’re still going strong, loving both their cuisine and the city they have chosen as theirs.
“We’re tolerant people,” Rueben said. “We’ll sit at a table and let others do their thing. Our philosophy is…our web magazine.”
To people like the Allens, the conscious decision to nix all animal products from their diets is a form of personal expression. Citing animal activism, a greener way of life, health and  morality as reasons to become vegan, the couple also noted a more pronounced societal consciousness about the origins of food within the past decades.
Veganism has transformed from an obscure dietary restriction to a recognizable lifestyle. It’s a buzzword that has gained enough social prominence to inspire its own Top Chef Masters episode, complete with up-and-coming hipster actress Zooey Deschanel as well as its own entry in the satirical blog stuffwhitepeoplelike.com.
This lifestyle has even infiltrated the USC area in the form of local vegan soul food joint Vegisoul on Jefferson Boulevard.
From the exterior, Vegisoul looks like the kind of joint the cruise ship tour guide tells vacationers to avoid during a port stay in some Bahamian town. But the interior is cleaner than most local restaurants, offering a beautiful mural on the wall of that starkly juxtaposes against the cracked asphalt and noisy traffic outside. The small restaurant is a lovely shade of warm yellow, and smells like the clean, sticky aroma of a good grandmother’s kitchen.
Yes, there is such a thing as vegan soul food. In a cuisine known for its emphasis on bacon fat, barbecue and butter, restaurants like Vegisoul craft the wholesome into the heartwarming feeling one gets after downing a plate of fried chicken — without the carnage.
Platters offer a combination of brown rice, red beans and greens next to surprisingly fulfilling fake meat: crispy barbeque chik’un and saucy fibbs (ribs). The dishes hold their own, even when compared to the real thing; these thoughtfully crafted foodstuffs aren’t just imitations, but a good hearty meal that invokes feelings of wholesome, honest-to-goodness deliciousness.
Here at Vegisoul, abstaining from meat is not a blatant health choice or an attempt to look just like Natalie Portman. It’s part of good eating, which — despite what starved reality show girls’ figures show — creates a Los Angeles culture that forgives and encourages all sorts of eating habits and religions and practices, even if they seem contradictory.
Although many Angelenos still choose animal protein for sustenance, vegetarianism is quickly becoming   a way of life that we accept and allow room for. Vegans and vegetarians are an essential part of the local culture —  anything goes as long as it doesn’t stray into our lane.
Only in LA would we have our vegan cake and eat it too.

<p>Hi Clare, thanks for writing this article!  I’ve been vegan for a year and a half, and I couldn’t be happier about the choice.  For me, it’s certainly not about eating less calories or fitting into an LA stereotype.  It’s about the morality–the animals, their rights, and the environment.  Vegans don’t believe in exploiting animals for human use–in beauty care products, clothing, or ANY animal product.  It’s definitely a way of life–a peaceful, non-violent way of life that I couldn’t recommend more.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and Vegisoul is awesome!</p>

Two weeks ago, Jahvid Best was the hottest name in college football. Fresh off a five-touchdown performance in a national spotlight game against Minnesota, the junior running back was on every Heisman short list.
Then came the embarrassment last Saturday against Oregon. The Ducks loaded the box against California and dared junior quarterback Kevin Riley to beat them. He didn’t. Oregon’s swarming defense stifled the Golden Bears offense and held Best to just 55 yards on 16 carries, a far cry from the gaudy statistics he put up in his first three games.

A lot has changed for Cal and Best in the last week. The team has fallen in the rankings and Best is no longer considered a favorite to win the Heisman trophy. Despite all the upheaval, however, one thing remains the same.
The 5-foot-10, 195-pound running back is still the biggest home run threat in the country and a head-splitting migraine for opposing teams to contain.
Just don’t expect him to tell you that.
“He doesn’t have a big head,” Riley said. “He’s a team-first guy and he’ll always be that way. He just cares about winning.”
Humility is nice, but it isn’t why Best has drawn the admiration of opposing coaches. That would be the 1,580 yards and 15 touchdowns he compiled last season on only 194 carries. Stopping him is the first thing on every coach’s mind, although the answer to that problem isn’t always obvious.
When a reporter asked USC coach Pete Carroll at his weekly press conference how he planned to contain Best, the coach provided a brief moment of levity.
“You got anything in mind for me? I could use a little help,” Carroll quipped.
All joking aside, the Oregon defense provided a blueprint last Saturday for other teams to follow. Set out to stop the run and hope Riley has a bad day. The Ducks had as many as 10 defenders crowd the line of scrimmage and forced the California offense to throw the ball.
“Oregon did a good job,” Riley said. “It was the first thing that worked against us this year so [USC] will probably try that. Hopefully we’ll hurt them.”
Neither Riley nor Best seemed particularly concerned at the prospect of the Trojans mimicking Oregon’s game plan. In fact, Best saw it as an opportunity for his teammates to shine.
“When teams do that we should be able to take advantage of it,” he said.
Regardless of whether Carroll decides to stack the box against Best this weekend, he said his defenders need to focus on their assignments.
“Whenever you have a breakaway guy like that, you have to be really disciplined,” he said. “Regardless of how you deploy your guys … you have to be in the right spots. You make a mistake and it just blasts down the line of scrimmage and he’s gone.”
Lots of football players are fast, but Best brings uncommon speed to the running back position. He ran a 10.3 100-meter dash in high school. For a little perspective on just how fast that is, USC junior Ahmad Rashad placed second last year at the NCAA championships with a time of 10.1 seconds.
Lots of sprinters have transitioned over to the gridiron with some success, but Best is unique. He is not a sprinter in football pads but a football player who possesses world-class speed.
“That’s the thing about Jahvid,” Cal coach Jeff Tedford said, “He can run inside and [he] has great lateral movement to make people miss and then his speed is exceptional when he gets in the open field, so he’s a real versatile back.”
That kind of speed and elusiveness has prompted comparisons of Best to a certain USC running back that tore up Pac-10 defenses several years ago.
Carroll said that while nobody has quite compared to Reggie Bush in terms of sheer playmaking ability, Best is the closest. And he might be faster.
“There was something about Reggie that he could make things happen in an extraordinary fashion,” Carroll said. “I think [Best] is a more consistent guy out of the backfield as a receiver. And he’s got the magic because he’s got that great speed, and he’s a very consistent player, too.”
Best said a lack of execution hurt the team last week as guys took turns messing up, but expected his team to rebound in a big way this week despite the speed and skill of the USC defense.
“We feel like if we execute it doesn’t matter what they’re doing,” he said. “We should get what we want from the plays.”
If Best gets what he wants this Saturday, USC is in for a long trip home from Berkeley.

Before you could tag yourself in Facebook pictures, organize your Top 8 friends on MySpace or send @MileyCyrus a love tweet, there was a web pioneer in the ’80s and ’90s named Josh Harris, whose aggressive business tactics and eccentricities have been captured by director Ondi Timoner in the searing documentary We Live in Public.
Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, We Live in Public explores the privacy and mental strength we surrender in order to achieve fame and recognition through the easiest and fastest-growing form of communication — the Internet. Though darkly unsettling and at times infuriating, Timoner’s documentary is an honest and relevant account of a dot-com miscreant fueled and funded by the birth of the Internet age.

The film charts Harris’s career through the ups and downs of working with a new and exciting invention and what it does to his sanity. He was quick to move in on the dot-com bubble when it exploded in the early ’90s, starting with Jupiter, a web-based business that quickly created the multimedia website pseudo.com that was, as Harris describes, intended to “put CBS out of business.” The million dollar-grossing website allowed users to comment on live webcam feeds, giving the camera subject a low-dose helping of narcissistic validation.
Timoner smartly chooses to focus on Harris, though, and what the unexpected success of his entrepreneurship does to his personal life and how it turns him into just as much of an egomaniac as the users of his creation.
Harris then begins to construct an underground empire in New York City; he throws wild parties for computer nerds and creates a face-painted alter-ego named “Luvvy,” who he embodies to counteract his high-stress, high-profile title as an Internet businessman. This is just the first in what would be many blips in his sanity. He begins to spend his money on vanity “experiments” — the most drastic and fascinating of which was a Big Brother-type project he called “Quiet: We Live in Public,” which had more than 100 New York City artists living together in cubicles while webcams videotaped their moves every second of the day. Culled from more than 1,000 hours of footage, the final project shows people running around naked, showering together, having sex in their cubicles and fighting over food. By harnessing the Internet’s ability to feed our need for recognition, Harris plays the role of God — or as the subjects call him, “Oz.” Over time, it becomes harder to classify him as one particular person. He is a computer geek, an entrepreneurial whiz kid, a performance artist, a face-painted alter-ego, a party boy and, now, the creator of his own universe.
After the NYPD busts Harris, assuming his project was a post-apocalyptic survival bunker for a cult of Y2K conspiracy theorists, he decides to take his hunger for fame to the next level by becoming the first man to completely document his life with his girlfriend on video. He places cameras all over his apartment — including his cat’s litter box and inside his toilet — and, like a real-life Truman Show, set up a website broadcasting his life every minute of the day.
Using Harris’ personal experiment as his prime example, Timoner focuses on the stark contrasts between living on and off camera, which Harris’ girlfriend explains lies in how the cameras skews motivations and actions. Eventually, the constant attention from voyeuristic web users destroyed the couple’s relationship and Harris’ career. With the stock market declining and his website losing hits because the loss of his girlfriend, Harris eventually found himself up to his neck in debt and decided to stop living in public for good.
By the end of the film, Timoner leaves us with an ambiguous message and it is difficult to tell if the rise and fall of Harris was due to his own lack of responsibility or the instability of predicting the next best dot-com sensation. Either way, Harris ends up as a basketball coach in Ethiopia — a land that is “rich with culture, not money” — as the greatest victim of the electronic, privacy-stealing empire he built. Though a different person, he is not necessarily sad but seems wounded by what he could have been in the wake of the successful social networking websites that started popping up at the turn of the century.
The film itself adds another layer to Harris’s story — putting audience members as voyeurs of a tainted exhibitionist — ultimately asking us if the value we see in the film is due to our own fascination of watching someone’s life crumble on screen or our ability to identify with Harris’s extreme vanity. Although We Live in Public is a bleak look at the fast-paced boom of the information age, it also profiles a man who tries to stay one step ahead at all times. This tactic is a lot like the Internet itself — rich with money, but lacking insight.

The Annenberg School for Communication honored diversity and history Wednesday night with Voices for Justice: 200 years of Latino Newspapers, which celebrated the
influential history and future of Spanish-speaking media.
Broadening horizons · USC professors and members of the local media led a discussion Wednesday about the importance of the changes facing Latino journalsim. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The event took place in the packed Annenberg Auditorium and, as Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III pointed out, set a record of attendance in the venue. It also kicked off a
month-long exhibit on the second floor of Annenberg’s lobby showcasing Latino newspapers and journalists.
Wilson opened the event by recognizing the place and power of America’s Latinos, from the key swing vote in the last election to the massive peaceful demonstrations about immigration reform across the nation in 2006.
“I hope you will see America as seen by Latino newspapers, and to the communities they serve,” he said, addressing the crowd. “I hope you will leave having gained new insights on our nation, and by knowing more about newspapers, better understand the Latinos that are a part of both.”
Professor Félix Guitiérrez, who specializes in diversity and media and served as moderator for the event, also addressed the attendees. He set the tone for the night, introducing the theme of “Liberation.”
“A liberation in terms of language, from Spanish to English, so that those here who are unfortunate to not speak Spanish, can still read, hear and
understand,” Guitiérrez said.
The event featured a panel, including Nicolás Kanellos, professor of Hispanic literature at the University of Houston and author of Hispanic Periodicals in the United States and Mónica Lozano, publisher and CEO of the nation’s largest Spanish-language daily newspaper, La Opinión. The audience also got a chance to view the film Voices for Justice: The Enduring Legacy of the Latino Press in the US directed by panelist Raymond Telles.
Telles, an Emmy winner, said he set out to bring life to the academic discoveries and history of Latino
journalism through the new media of film.
“It’s about bringing to life an important part of American history, and Latinos are for the most part, for many, many years, our history hasn’t existed in mass media,” he said. “One of the things that helps us bring it to life is that we have some damn good stories to tell. We have the opportunity in the film to bring these stories to life in a way that people get it.”
The use of the film to tell what was otherwise a print-based story made it meaningful and accessible to students, even those with no knowledge of Latino culture.
Josh Rosenbaum, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that Telles’ film gave great insight into filmmaking as well as the issues.
“It caught my attention,” he said. “It conveyed important issues dealing with racial identity, that otherwise would go unnoticed by mainstream media. I didn’t think I had any interest in the issue, but the film captivated me.”
Christina Tasooji, a senior majoring in business administration and accounting whose grandfather was a Mexican immigrant, said the event’s message of history resonated with her.
“Especially for our young generation, at this time when immigration laws and politics are a big part, understanding history will let people see clearly,” she said. “This project as a medium to express the alternative points of view, to capture them, was great.”
The event was part of a larger initiative to emphasize Annenberg’s commitment to diversity and to further explore the wide range of cultures thriving in LA.
“The first newspaper in LA was the Los Angeles Star,” Guitiérrez said. “But it really was two newspapers. The front pages are the Los Angeles Star, and in the back, the last pages are La Estrella de Los Angeles.”
Guitiérrez emphasized that Latino journalism is not, as some believe, simply mainstream news translated into Spanish, but is its own entity with a long and storied history.
Lozano echoed this sentiment. She said La Opinión is meant to serve not only as a source of information but to be a vital tool in helping recent immigrants adapt to the US. Lozano cited the importance of recognizing Spanish-language media’s role in history.
“The point of view captured by this segment of the media is important, and people need to recognize the unique and important space Spanish-language media has in this country and the community they serve,” she said.

The last time I had been to a roller rink, a fifth-grade boy asked me to hold his hand and skate along to the Backstreet Boys. The most intense competition of that night was when the entire rink gathered for a game of “red light, green light” — and there was certainly no body-checking.
A decade later, I didn’t exactly know what to expect when I entered the Doll Factory for a roller derby exhibition game between the Tough Cookies and the Varsity Brawlers.

As I waited in line, I took stock of the people around me. Directly ahead, a woman with waist-length dreadlocks chatted with a short-haired blonde whose shirt was emblazoned with the words “Roller Derby is so gay.”
I knew I looked out of place when a volunteer (I could tell she was affiliated with the Derby Dolls by her outfit of tattoo-sleeve tights, spandex booty shorts and combat boots, which stood out even in this crowd) came up to me specifically and asked if I needed help. Wearing jeans and a blazer, I wondered if I could quickly put on some more eye makeup to blend in just a tiny bit better. Or, as Felon D. Generous passed me by, if only I had a cool nickname. I scanned the crowd and spotted a man in a green polo shirt — a comrade in the mundane. We made eye contact and acknowledged each other with a slight nod.
The converted warehouse now known as the Doll Factory was painted black with smatterings of hot pink skulls decorating the walls. Past the giant blow-up Tecate beer can and various posters rested the banked track, above which hung a roller skate-shaped disco ball. I leaned up against a railing and watched the Tough Cookies and the Varsity Brawlers warm up, skating and jumping and twirling around each other.
One of the referees, Oliver Clothesoff, skated to the starting line and 10 girls lined up on the track — eight in a pack and two a few feet behind them. With the first whistle, the eight girls — the “blockers” — began skating, jostling for position on the track. Seconds later, another whistle blew. Two “jammers” with starred helmets sped off, trying to battle their way through the pack.
On the first turn around the rink, Gori Spelling, jammer for the Tough Cookies, was rammed into the padded railing by a rib-cracking hit from a Varsity Brawler. It was the kind of hit that, in a football game, you would hear on TV. No one blew a whistle; no one took a second look. The pack was off — and so was Gori Spelling, racing to make up the few seconds of time lost while getting her bearings.
The rest of the match went much the same way. The announcers explained that a team can only score points after its jammer passes every blocker of the opposing team, assembled in the “pack.” The blockers help their own jammer break through the pack while attempting to impede the other team’s jammer from getting past. Once a jammer gets through the pack, she races around the rink in order to lap the pack, scoring a point for each opponent that she passes a second time.
Blockers, who must stay within 20 feet of the pack, cannot use elbows or any part of the arm below the elbow to block. It is illegal to block above the shoulders or trip another skater. Penalties for doing so include having to sit out of the next round, or “jam.”
Even with these rules, the hits are brutal. In the second half, a Varsity Brawler was knocked off of the outside of the track, falling to the ground about three feet below. A big “oh!” came from the crowd and play stopped. Her referee’s whistle in hand, Gia de los Muertos’s stunned expression was visible even through the skull painted over her face. But the Varsity Brawler climbed right back into the rink and the game continued as if nothing happened.
With drama like that, it is easy to see why Shauna Cross, who stumbled across roller derby while searching for a tennis partner on Craigslist, felt the need to chronicle this spectacle in her book Derby Girl and the subsequent screenplay, Whip It!.
“I had never experienced a sport where you can be as competitive as you want to be, as feminine and as sexy and loud or not loud and tough,” said Cross, who skates under the moniker Maggie Mayhem. “It was just too good not to write about.”
The indie comedy-drama, which marks actress Drew Barrymore’s directorial début, stars Academy Award-nominated Ellen Page as Bliss Cavender, an off-beat 17-year-old desperately trying to find her niche in her rural Texas town. That niche? Roller derby.
According to Barrymore, as both a first-time director and derby skater, she “tried to film it, cinematically, the way that it felt.”  Her respect for the derby girls was undeniable.
And who wouldn’t respect a group of girls who, as Zoë Bell put it, have an after party to “appreciate the fact that [they] just kicked the shit out of each other.”
Page and Barrymore trained for three months before the production of Whip It! began, alongside real Derby Dolls Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica — or Krissy Krash and Iron Maiven, respectively — of the Tough Cookies, who play Bliss’s teammates in the film. And the actresses had battle scars to show for it.
Barrymore recounted a wrestling bout with another skater in which both of their body weights landed on her thigh.
“I had a bruise that — I’m not kidding — was a foot long and a foot wide. My entire leg was covered. I was like, ‘Yeah, that’s a merit badge. That’s cool,’” she said.
And, as Barrymore said, “there’s nothing better than a girl fight.”
But beyond the bruises, there is an aura about the derby that the cast wanted to capture.
“I’m looking at the crowd and there’s a yuppie couple and a grandma and grandpa of one of the derby girls and then like a 19-year-old alterna-boy,” Barrymore said. “I looked around and I thought that there’s no one who is not accepted in this arena for who they are, their ethnicity or their economics or their style. There was such an unjudgemental world and that’s a party I like to go to, and that’s what I wanted to show.”
And in that crowd, the girl wearing the jeans and the blazer felt like she belonged at the party, too.

Michael Stuhlbarg seems a little out of place.
The ”goodness gracious”-exclaiming, soft-spoken actor — already popular on and off Broadway on the East Coast but comparatively unknown here — carries a sweet, “aw shucks” air that probably won’t mix well with Hollywood. That personality must have inspired the Coen Brothers, American masters enamored of deceptively naïve characters, to cast him as the lead in A Serious Man.
Hidden talent · Veteran stage actor Michael Stulbarg, who was nominated for a Tony Award in 2005, captured the lead in A Serious Man, the latest black comedy from acclaimed filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen. - Photo courtesy of Focus Features
In the film, Stuhlbarg plays Larry Gopnik, a Jewish physics professor in 1967 Minnesota who finds his life unraveling in the face of divine intervention. While the Coen Brothers’ latest work has something to say about the role of religion in modern life, Stuhlbarg said he was initially attracted to the wit and typically wicked sense of humor with which the filmmakers infused the screenplay.
“I just enjoyed it for its individual nuances,” Stuhlbarg explained. “I didn’t look for a message. I just found it to be so funny. That’s a huge Geiger counter for me in terms of how I respond to stuff. If it makes me laugh, you’ve got me.”
The film opens with a seriously strange scene separate from the main story — a parable about a Jewish couple in old Poland and their run-in with a possible zombie. Long before he auditioned for the part of Larry, Stuhlbarg read for the part of the husband.
“I had to learn that whole part in Yiddish,” Stuhlbarg said, chuckling a little. “So I went to a tutor and learned the whole scene in Yiddish and came back to them and did it. They laughed a lot, and that made me really happy.
Although the directors eventually went with someone already fluent in the language — “and rightfully so,” added the actor — they called Stuhlbarg back to read for the parts of both Larry and his pathetic brother Arthur.
He was at an actor’s retreat six weeks before the film was scheduled to shoot, preparing to play either Larry or Arthur, when Joel Coen called him up with, “We’ll put you out of your misery, you’re playing Larry.”
A Serious Man was shot on location in Minnesota, the same Midwest backdrop as the Coens’ masterpiece Fargo. The filmmakers found their supporting actors locally and most of the film was shot using real locations and extras. Stuhlbarg remarked that shooting a crucial bar mitzvah scene in a real synagogue and with a real congregation made his job as an actor simultaneously easier and stranger.
“As [Larry’s son] Danny comes down from the pulpit after his bar mitzvah, and he’s got his kiddush cup in his hand, and the whole congregation breaks in with adon olam,” Stuhlbarg explained. “It was like being back in synagogue. It was crazy. I just had flashbacks of my bar mitzvah.”
Part of the film’s humor comes from the indifference of the Jewish community to Larry’s growing plight. As with Fargo, the Coens drew characters from their own experiences, leading to some broad sketches of Jews with the potential to offend. Stuhlbarg disagreed with this sentiment.
“There are truths within archetypes, you know. That’s why they’re archetypes,” Stuhlbarg said. “But I think they’re more human than that. Also I think they’re infused with a sense of mischief and a sense of love. It’s also Joel and Ethan who are creating them, and they had a particular experience growing up in their community, and that will reflect what is seen on the screen.”
If anything, Stuhlbarg felt that his character’s plight could hit home with any audience member, regardless of background.
“I guess [Larry] resonates with everybody in the sense that … his life is one thing and then he gets some curveballs thrown at him, and he has to make the best of them and go along as best he can with them,” Stuhlbarg said. “We can all empathize with that when that sometimes happens in our lives.”
Stuhlbarg, who trained at the famous Juilliard School in New York and was nominated for a Tony Award for his work in Martin McDonagh’s dark The Pillowman, also offered some insight into making the transition from stage to screen.
“They really feed off each other in a beautiful way. My film and my television work tend to make my theater work more simple, and my theater work tends to ground me in a way that informs my film and television work. I want to continue to do all of it,” Stuhlbarg said.
With A Serious Man opening  Friday after excellent reviews on the festival circuit, and his recent, acclaimed work onstage, Stuhlbarg suddenly finds himself able to more carefully choose his work.
“Some doors opened for me, and … I became a little more discerning about the kind of work that I wanted to do. I’m getting older, and the amount of energy that I have to expel — I am trying to use a little more judiciously,” Stuhlbarg said.

We are fat.
This is according to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reveals 63 percent of adult Americans have a body mass index in excess of 25.0, and are therefore overweight.
Katie Kittrell | Daily Trojan
And the fact that obesity in American children has tripled in the past 30 years.
Or a report from the office of the US Surgeon General that revealed obesity is responsible for 300,000 deaths annually.
With such damning evidence of gluttony, it seems that someone should propose a radical change to the status quo to bring the nation’s health out of its free-falling trajectory. Something so groundbreaking that it would be able to single-handedly whip our poor, huddled, tired and obese masses into shape. If such a calling seems to be a bit too ambitious, perhaps something a bit smaller and pragmatic would suffice as well.
So, short of signing every household in the country up for a Jack LaLanne power juicer and hot yoga sessions, what could possibly help to thin out the obesity problem in America?
A soda tax.
Maybe it’s not the most astonishing option, but the intended purpose is still to try to help rescue a nation verging on extreme obesity.
In the most recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, a group of leading health experts proposes a tax on sugary soft drinks, and a higher one in states that already have existing policies, hoping that higher prices will make families second-guess their grocery lists and ultimately reduce the amount of soda consumed.
The proposal has the support of leading physicians, who hope that the predicted drop-off in soda consumption will also increase the demand for healthier alternatives.
In related news, it appears that leading physicians also moonlight as economists during the recession.
Naturally, those in the soda industry are none too happy with this hypothetical proposal, although the CDC says it does not have any immediate plans to enact such a policy. Some have even gone as far as to label the proposal and any similar policies as being “socialist,” with the government overstepping its boundaries in telling the public what to eat and drink.
But while the tax seems to be very narrow-minded in its attempts to single out one particular product, it does not seem to be unfounded. After all, removing one harmful component of a poor diet is better than keeping it around. For proof, one need not look any further than Trojan alumnus and NFL running back LenDale White, who attributes his dramatic offseason weight loss solely to the removal of tequila from his diet.
Clearly, the researchers involved with the study appear to think that if you want to hurt someone, it’s best to hit them where it hurts the most — in their wallet.
Unfortunately for these same researchers, the majority of the population appears unable to feel their wallets from underneath their excess body mass.
For starters, the proposed tax would only apply to sugary sodas and not their diet beverage counterparts. Meaning, the soda tax would not include all sodas, but only the sodas that are bad for you. This sounds logical up until the point that it’s revealed that the study only focused on sugary sodas; diet sodas could very well be nearly as bad as their full-bodied alternatives. Thus, a sugary soda tax encourages families to stock up on diet sodas, which may turn out to be just marginally better. It doesn’t seem that the effort put into the tax would justify the minimal benefits of the switch from regular to diet.
Also, it doesn’t appear that the price of soda itself will have so great of an impact on the demand anyway — sales seem to be doing fine on campus despite the fact that soda prices fluctuate between the various retail locations and vending machines on campus. In a land of excess that features $6 cups of coffee, $40 a day parking and $1,500 portable Facebook machines, the increased price of soda would come as an afterthought.
Overall, it seems that in the realm of indulgence, the well-intentioned message of measures such as the proposed soda tax falls on deaf ears.
An alcohol tax has done little to curb the sale of 30-packs of beer used to furnish fraternity beer pong leagues across The Row, much in the same way a food tax has yet to yield the consumption of Chanos’ heaping plate of carne asada fries on any given Thursday night. And this comes despite the fact that at 8.25 percent, California carries the highest state sales tax in the country. Furthermore, the law that prevents drivers from using their cell phones while driving is seen as more of an inconvenience than, say, a practical way to curb the number of driving fatalities.
Why then, is it safe for anyone to assume that a soda tax would have any better of a chance at success?
Maybe the real issue is that the government is getting fat off the taxes from the vices we’ve turned to in order to cope with the various stressors in life. If that’s the case, we have no room to gripe, as we’ve only eaten ourselves into a monetary hole.
Regardless, attempts to help guide the nutritional decisions of the American public through higher soda taxes seem to be pointless, fizzling out and falling flat.

A very well-written and reasoned article. I think that if diabetes and the inability to walk up a flight of stairs hasn’t stopped people from eating fatty or sugary foods, nothing will.
However, creating financial incentives for grocery stores with fresh produce to open in low-income areas could have an effect. When I was a student at USC, there were very few healthy options in the neighborhood.
Poor health ends up costing us all in the end, whether it’s in providing emergency health care to heart attack victims who can’t pay, or simply in days lost at work. Take a break from the Big Mac and try some veggies (at least some lean turkey?).
<p>The soda tax is yet another transparent motion by the arrogant wealthy (i.e. urban Democrats) to try to control the behavior of <em>other people</em> you know, “for their own good”. Why propose a tax that hurts Coca-cola and McDonalds, but noticeably leaves Starbucks and other snooty coffee shops alone? Obviously, the philosophy is that government needs to tell the lower and middle classes how to live their lives, but the self-appointed elite are exempt. People are rejecting two things — first, the philosophy that government should dictate to us what we eat and drink, and second, the very overt discrimination against certain classes of society.</p>

I hate the message this tax sends…people in the US have become too fat AND stupid that they need government driven disincentives interfering with everyday choices. How about the government start taxing stupid people if the TV is turned on for more then a certain set number of hours?!?!?!
Let Darwinism filter out people who can not control their own bodies and please allow the rest of us who exercise and watch our weight enjoy a Coke without getting nipped by the Tax Man again.
While adding a sin tax to soda probably won’t stop people from getting their favorite soda pop, the additional revenue could be a useful tool to fund programs that could educate individuals on the importance of health and diet.  While I disagree on the fact that 63% of American’s are overweight (using BMI is an entirely non-scientific method that does little to judge one’s health… are you really telling me that Taylor Mays and his 6% body fat  is obese?), I do recognize that obesity is second behind tobacco on the list of actual causes of death and something should be done.

What do Hillary Clinton, Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein all have in common? Besides changing history, all three of these powerful figures are firstborn children.
While many stereotypes and anecdotes exist about birth order — firstborns are conservative and younger siblings are rebellious — hard evidence for these assertions can be hard to find. And should we accept these generalizations as being true, the question then becomes, what is the mechanism behind it?
Many studies have shown inequities between first and later-born children: Norwegian researchers using military records found that firstborns are, on average, three IQ points smarter than the next eldest child; studies from the Philippines show that later-born siblings are shorter and weigh less on average than earlier-born children; another study found that 43 percent of CEOs are firstborns in comparison to 23 percent who are lastborns.
Why the discrepancies? Many believe that firstborns are the only children for a period of time before the next eldest is born — providing them invaluable resource in the form of parental time and attention.
The firstborn also tends to uphold the status quo of the family, and is thought to be more conservative than their more unruly younger siblings. This is probably due to the fact that in the fight for parental resources, firstborns are more likely to get care and attention if they please their parents without making waves; however, younger siblings have to fight for attention from their older siblings who have already filled the conservative niche and therefore act out to win their parents’ time.
This kind of speculation, however, remains unfounded without studies to back up such hypotheses.
This is what Joseph Price of Cornell University hoped to change. His study on birth order uses data from the American Time Use Survey, administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wherein respondents are asked to recount their activities from the previous day, reporting the starting and ending time of each activity, their location and the members of their household who were present at the time.
His results showed that in families with two children, firstborns receive about 20 more minutes of quality time with their fathers and 25 more with their mother each day than a second child of the same age does.
Price asserts that the difference is a result of parents spending equal time with each of their children at a particular point in time, but spending less with all of them as the children get older.
Interestingly, Price also finds that in two-child families, “second children get 10 percent less total time, 41 percent less time reading and 15 percent more time watching television with his or her mother.” These results show that out of the already decreased amount of overall time younger siblings get, they receive less quality time spent with their parents than the firstborns. This perhaps explains the differences in grades and behavior mentioned earlier that are attributed to increased quality time, and the rambunctious reputations that younger siblings tend to have.
As mentioned earlier, younger siblings have to find different strategies to win over parental attention, since the older sibling usually tends to be more responsible and conservative. This goes hand in hand with Price’s finding that younger siblings receive less total and quality time with their parents. Older siblings are said to have “high-power strategies” in that they’re older and bigger, whereas younger siblings have to resort to “low-power strategies,” one of which is considered humor.
Voltaire, Jonathan Swift and Stephen Colbert are all funny lastborns, perhaps suggesting that younger siblings resort to humor to get parental attention when they are tied up with all the older children.
Interestingly, some studies have shown that firstborns tend to score better on conscientiousness, whereas later-born children score higher on agreeableness, perhaps because the oldest child tries to be successful to win attention and praise, whereas the youngest focuses on being more flexible and getting along with the parents in order to win affection.
Whatever the reasons may be, the various studies mentioned here provide interesting insights into the world of birth order, and mechanics of raising children. There are some caveats though, of course, as every generalization has its anomalies, and every family situation is different.
Since the studies base the differences between firstborns and younger siblings on parental resources, families with many children could show less discrepancy between each, as in each case the parents are strapped for time, money, etc. One could also argue that a parent needs to spend less time with each child after the first because they learn how to parent more effectively, and spend less time fumbling and making mistakes.
While Price’s study does give empirical data, there are still some flaws — including the usage of a survey for his data that may be unreliable or may contain hidden variables.
But the stereotypes remain, and thus leave us wondering — does our birth order shape who we are?
Tiffanie Wu is a junior majoring in business administration and neuroscience.
I agree, this is extremely well-written and the writer could have a career in journalism. The only part i didn’t follow was the bit where she says that Stephen Colbert is funny.
I think this was a very well-written, thought-provoking and informative piece.  The writer’s style is mature, controlled and fluid, and the article itself was well thought-out and intriguing.  I think the Daily Trojan should run more articles like this one, where the writer actually knows what they are doing and saying.  Good job to Tiffany Wu.

Neon Tommy is reporting that the victim of last spring’s fatal hit-and-run had a high level of alcohol in her system at the time of the incident.
According to the autopsy report obtained by Neon Tommy, 18-year-old Adrianna Bachan had a blood alcohol level of .17, compared to the legal limit of .08
This development could become a factor in the upcoming trial of Claudia Cabrera and Josue Luna, the couple accused in the hit-and-run. Both face felony charges of leaving the scene of an accident and Cabrera faces an additional charge of vehicular manslaughter.
Luna and Cabrera appeared in court for an arraignment Tuesday and are set to return to court for trial on Nov. 4.
Her BAC doesn’t excuse the fact that this couple drove fast enough to run over two people, kill one, then drag a young man off their hood and leave him in the middle of the road with severe injuries. That doesn’t excuse them driving away from the incident, and then fleeing the country.  Whatever her BAC was, the actions surrounding the hit-and-run are disgusting.
@sarah:
“Whatever her BAC was, the actions surrounding the hit-and-run are disgusting.”
Yes, they are.
I’m pretty sure that the two victims were not crossing at the actual crosswalk, as pointed out by a couple of witnesses. Either way this proves they weren’t 100% conscious of their surroundings.
.08 is the legal limit for driving, why would this have anything to do with a pedestrian? If anything, the legal limit in any situation was 0.00 BAC since she was under the age of 21.
Adrianna’s contributory negligence might have some effect on whether the parties get charged with gross vehicular manslaughter or just plain Vehicular Manslaughter. However, I don’t think a reasonable jury will side with a party that ran over anyone crossing through a pedestrian crosswalk at the adequate time, regardless of her state of mind.

Anyone planning to hack into the school’s website may have missed their opportunity.
EDUCAUSE, a nonprofit organization that promotes the use of information technology in education, has just announced the start of an internet-wide project to enhance the security of all .edu websites, including USC’s homepage.
The project hopes to increase the security of websites that end in .edu, by adding a digital signature, an extra security feature that will keep hackers from tapping into .edu websites. EDUCAUSE wants to make these websites safer for students who often input important personal information online, such as social security and bank account numbers.
Called DNSSEC, or Domain Name System Security Extensions, the system will use a digital signature to ensure websites are what they say they are.
“It strikes me as mostly preventative,” said the Director of Communication and Marketing for USC’s IT Department Kevin Durkin. “If it were not done, it would be easier for malicious people to do [malicious] things.”
USC is currently in the testing stages, and DNSSEC’s official launch is set for March 2010.
“It’s an extra security step that will occur automatically,” said Steve Worona, director of policy and networking programs for EDUCAUSE, so students won’t have to worry about lagging internet or technical issues.

First on Tuesday’s agenda: elections. At Tuesday’s Senate meeting, Emiko Suzuki and Scott Hummel, co-directors of elections and recruitment for USG, said revisions to the elections code should be completed by the beginning of November.
With the problems of the previous election cycle in mind, the commission plans to clarify the code’s language and prevent similar issues.
“It’s not that the election was handled poorly last year. It’s that the elections code was written in such a way that it’s easy to abuse,” Hummel said.
Changes to the elections code resonate with many USG officials, who witnessed last year’s disqualification and reinstatement of presidential candidate Owen Caine and vice presidential candidate Maya Babla under allegations of improper solicitation.
“[USG President] Holden [Slusher] and I support this initiative 100 percent. I don’t want anyone to ever go through something like that because of a code that could be easily amended,” USG Vice President Ashlie Chan said of last year’s election cycle.
Second on Tuesday’s agenda: KSCR. As Suzuki and Hummel work to address last year’s election mishaps, USG’s financial officials and staff from KSCR are working to prevent the station’s funding problems from resurfacing.
KSCR is requesting $2,234 from the Senate to send some of its staff to the College Music Journal Marathon and Film Festival.
KSCR originally applied to USG’s Leadership Funding Board and was told it would be receiving the money, general manager Zachary Wolf said.
But because KSCR already receives funds through USG’s line item budget, the radio station is not eligible to apply for aid from any of the funding boards. After learning that the Leadership Fund would no longer be sponsoring their trip to the festival, KSCR now has to seek funding from the Senate allocations fund in order to comply with USG’s bylaws, Wolf said.
“It’s actually confusing at this point. I haven’t read the bylaws and I don’t know which bylaws they’re referring to, but it doesn’t seem like a malicious revocation of the funding,” Wolf said. “It just seems like an opportunity for explanation. From our standpoint, we don’t think there are going to be too many bumps in the road.”

I believe hope is a thing that I will find sometime/if someone just will show me, belted Noah of Noah Gundersen and the Courage under the colored stage lights in Bovard Auditorium. His lyrics set the tone for the evening.
On Monday, members of the non-profit organization To Write Love On Her Arms visited USC to promote awareness about its mission to provide aid to those struggling with depression and addiction.
Reach out · Non-profit organization To Write Love On Her Arms brought compelling speakers and musicians to Bovard, Monday. - Constance Shao | Daily Trojan
“No one deserves to do life alone,” said founder Jamie Tworkowski. “Help is real. Hope is real.”
Sitting on a stool in black jeans and a grey thermal, he spoke about how the movement unexpectedly began.
In January 2006, while Tworkowski was working in Florida, one of his co-workers committed suicide. Tworkowski’s boss gave his team only 30 minutes to deal with the suicide before getting back to work. The company wouldn’t discuss the death or the broader topic of suicide prevention.
With his co-worker’s death still on his mind, Tworkowski met a girl named Renee through a mutual friend. According to Tworkowski, Renee had been through years of addiction and had a history of both depression and self-injury. She was lost while surrounded by friends who sent her discouraging and condescending messages about using drugs and not getting help. When Renee attempted to get help, she was denied entry to a treatment center because it was not equipped with the necessary “detox” period she needed. At this point, Tworkowski and his friends stepped in.
“We spent five days with her, keeping her sober. There was a sense of privilege, being able to be there with this girl who had been through so much,” Tworkowski recalled.
His friends tried to tell Renee that blanket words like “sobriety,” “healing” and “freedom” could be real. Mid-week, Tworkowski asked a question he thought Renee would surely be unwilling to answer: “Will you tell your story?”
Renee agreeed, prompting the creation of To Write Love On Her Arms.
Tworkowski wrote a two-page post about Renee’s struggle on the social network site MySpace. It was never a business plan to Tworkowski or his friends, but a way to articulate their belief that there is something better for everyone struggling with problems like addiction, self-injury and depression. The price of Renee’s treatment, however, prompted Tworkowski to make shirts and sell them to people he knew, including the lead singer of Switchfoot. The musician wore the shirt at a concert in Florida, which in turn jumpstarted traffic on the MySpace page. Today, the non-profit To Write Love On Her Arms has received more than 100,000 messages from over 100 countries.
The mission of To Write Love on Her Arms is “presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury and suicide.” The group exists to encourage, inform and directly invest in treatment and recovery.
“It resonates with anyone who is alive. It speaks into broken places in people’s lives where darkness is,” said Rich Sullivan, a team member and old friend of Tworkowski. “Whether you’re 10 years old or 70 years old, pain is universal.”
Most members of Tworkowski’s team were moved by Renee’s story or had a similar experience that made them want to get involved.
“It was not a smart business decision for anybody,” Sullivan said, chuckling. The movement is powered instead by the belief that every life holds the same value and meaning.
Tworkowski spoke of the all-encompassing nature of To Write Love On Her Arms.
“It’s not just white people, these are not just ‘emo’ problems,” he said. “This is part of being human around the world. All of us know what pain feels like.”
The project is extremely relevant in a time when depression is the third leading underlying cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds in the United States; yet two-thirds of people with depression never seek treatment.
“They all live in this place, but they are living alone in this place,” Tworkowski added.
According to Tworkowski, those who are feeling sadness or sorrow are more likely to stay quiet than reach out.
“We say friends and family are the closest to us, yet we can’t even reach out to them. It’s scary,” counselor Aaron Moore explained.
This is why Tworkowski believes community is important for those fighting the darkness within.
“Life has nothing to do with how many Facebook friends you have, but with the people who actually know your struggles and dreams — which are not always so far apart,” Tworkowski said. “[Getting help] will be worth it.”

Ikea tapped into an incredible market when it decided to sell inexpensive, nice-looking furniture to anyone willing to assemble it and explain to their friends why their sofa is named “pëgfardj.”
But Ikea furniture is a shortcut like any other, and what you get when you lug home a box of lumber pieces is a combination of what you pay for and how well you read Swedish. In other words, your Melbu bed frame might look great, but if — God forbid — you mistakenly failed to screw the Maalm onto the Saaknute, your next slumber party might get wild in a way that was unanticipated.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Do-it-yourself projects are often best done by others or, in the case of one Costa Mesa man, not done at all.
Last Tuesday, the Costa Mesa Fire Department’s Urban Search and Rescue squad were summoned to come to the aid of a man who had attempted a do-it-yourself penis enlargement.
(At this point in the story, male readers are invited to stop reading to spare themselves any emotional pain. Female readers who have recently been dumped, ignored or otherwise ill-treated by the opposite sex are invited to read the story aloud gleefully.)
The man, who was unidentified but was said to be in his 50s, apparently spam-blocked his email account too effectively, and decided that the best way to make his little man a little bigger was to poke it through a steel ring, whose original purpose was a dumbbell weight fastener.
As far as do-it-yourself mistakes go, this is way worse than forgetting to screw the Maalm to the Saaknute.
The man, described by one officer as “kind of a wingnut,” thought that the weight from the dumbbell fastener would increase the length of his manhood. After three days, however, his penis had blackened and swollen to five times its normal size.
In this last respect, at least the frugal fixer-upper was successful. Five times bigger than original size is better than even the least subtle spam advertisements can promise.
Still, the man made a crucial mistake that anyone who has ever attempted a do-it-yourself project knows to avoid: When the project has failed in an obvious way, get help. In this case, the blackening of the mishandled member should have been the tip-off.
At this point, the story gets better, although “better” is relative as the story is about a man who had to call the fire department when his penis got stuck in a metal ring and became unrecognizable.
With the flesh in his penis about to die, the firefighters sedated the man and prepared to saw through the metal ring; to do this, they set up a watering system to mitigate any potential damage from the hot sparks.
(As with other examples in this article, this should not be attempted at home.)
The procedure took two hours, and resulted in the successful removal of the dumbbell fastener from the man’s “thing,” as one of the officers phrased it.
The moral derived from the almost fable-like story of The Man Who Would Be Well-Hung is clearly that some things are best left to professionals. Readers could even infer from the story a more specific lesson — namely, that men in particular are susceptible to the sirenic allure of DIY projects.
The trope of the male who won’t ask for directions is oft thrown about, and there is no doubt that if the Costa Mesa man were lost on the road, he would have driven blindfolded rather than look at signs.
It’s unfair, though, to use the misguided sausage-sweller as an example of all that is wrong with arrogant, pigheaded men who refuse to pull over the car and ask the man at the gas station how to get to Ikea.
Men and women both are guilty of do-it-yourself hubris. Everyone believes themselves to be capable of fixing anything, be it their plumbing, their love life or their physical appearance. It is this tragic flaw that is the cause of so many flooded homes, misguided pick-up attempts and terrible, terrible hair colorings.
This is not to say everyone should stop buying IKEA furniture and start shelling out money for every odd-job that needs to be done. We’re a society that invented a vacuum that moves itself around — this article should not be seen as a call for increased slothfulness.
What men and women alike can learn from the Costa Mesa man is the importance of learning your limits. And to know that it is a really, really bad idea to stick your body parts in small, steel rings.

We all fear being ill. It is a rational fear that encourages us to take care of our health — to eat well, get rest and exercise. But when it becomes too large, fear of illness becomes an illness itself.
Hypochondriasis is a mental disorder characterized by excessive fear of or preoccupation with a serious illness, despite medical testing and reassurance to the contrary. It often involves constant self-examination, self-diagnosis and a preoccupation with one’s body. Those who suffer from hypochondria often doubt their physician’s diagnoses, and are unconvinced when reassured they do not have a serious medical condition.
And while hypochondriacs have been studied for a while, a new breed of hypochondria has emerged in recent years: cyberchondria.
A recent study performed by a research team from Microsoft found that “cyberchondria,” or the unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptoms after web investigation, may be a growing problem among web users who seek medical information online.
The study found that “the use of the Web search as a diagnostic procedure … can lead users to believe that common symptoms are likely the result of serious illness.”
Those with cyberchondria may enter a search for “headache,” and end up looking at “brain tumor.” The study’s authors argue that though brain tumors can often be indicated by headaches, the frequency of brain tumors is so low that it is unreasonable and anxiety-causing for someone to associate his headache with the possibility of cancer.
The study focuses on three kinds of searches: web crawl (which uses a program or automated script to browse the web in a methodical way), web search (generally surfing the Internet) and domain search (searches performed in medical search engines).
The findings indicate that out of the people who performed searches for “headache,”  the probability of ending at “brain tumor” is 0.03 for web crawlers, 0.25 for web searchers and 0.00 for domain searchers.
Considering that the actual US annual incidence rate of brain tumors is about 1 in 10,000, the web crawl and web search results illustrate an unusually high skew.
The study’s authors argue that most of cyberchondria is based on an intrinsic problem with understanding the web as a diagnostic tool.
Most people believe that search results appearing first are the most likely to be relevant; a survey conducted by the researchers showed that “three in four respondents have at least once interpreted the ranking of web search results as indicating the likelihood of the illness.”
We all believe the web can be a useful tool in examining symptoms, but, as the study shows, the Internet can lead to  serious misdiagnoses.
And it turns out that regular folks aren’t the only ones who struggle with medically related searches; even some doctors and nurses misdiagnose when using the web.
Additionally, the study examined “escalation,” which the authors defined as the observed increases in the severity of concerns represented by the search terms within a single search session.
Though no direct interpretation can be made about the nature of an escalation (an example of which would be the “headache” to “brain tumor” jump in a single session), some information can be inferred.
The study’s authors suggest that this could represent a type of anxiety, as their fear increases and their perceived understanding of their condition is greatly exaggerated.
Though the study did have flaws — for example, logs of web searches are not indicative of a person’s emotions, perceptions or thoughts — it certainly provides an interesting insight to what has become a casualty of the information boom.
Cyberchondria is an instinct gone wrong. Web-based medical sources can be helpful, but diagnoses still need to be made by doctors.
The problem seems to be that many people do not seek physician help after consulting the Internet.
An evolutionary survival instinct to stay healthy and take care of ourselves has been distorted into a fear that prompts people to believe they are sick and seek knowledge without consulting a professional — which, ironically, causes unhealthy stress and anxiety.

For a lot of people, sanity resurfaced at about 3:00 p.m. Saturday afternoon. The LSAT, a monster of an exam, came and went — and left thousands behind exhausted yet soothed and suddenly unsure of what to do with the open pockets of time they now saw in their schedule.
It is ironic, then — or perhaps “fitting” is the more appropriate sentiment — that my nightmare began the next day. While a relieved population of USC students reveled in the completion of 60 percent of their law school application, I dreaded the start of two months that would culminate in my own momentous Saturday afternoon.
When I graduated high school, I promised myself one thing: no more standardized testing. I’m sure you did, too. Say it with me now: no more overpriced test prep books, no more long hours of fake scantrons and smudging ink, and absolutely no more sharpened No. 2 pencils that broke with every bubble. I swore — there was a pinky promise, a blood oath and maybe even a ring thrown in for good measure — I was done.
Two and a half years later, I am my own living, breathing Judas.
The PSAT was truly my first exposure to the idea that one test could determine what years and years of schooling said otherwise. I had friends with stellar GPAs who obtained average test scores while some of the slackers and pot addicts scored in the top percentiles in the nation. Then came the ACT (or, for those of you from either coast, the SAT) a year later — affirmation that yes, one test says more than eight years of perfecting an instrument or three years’ worth of daily attendance. Diligent? Passionate? They didn’t care — isn’t the world made easier when numbers are posted on our foreheads instead?
But two tests to get into college seems to be an easy break compared to the rest of the world. Yes, the occasional American private school demands an entrance exam or two, but this process is for the very few, a very narrow margin of the population of schoolchildren around the nation. I thought it was silly. I did my homework, raised my hand when needed and studied; this was proof enough, I told myself, that I was a well-behaved, perfect student. My parents agreed until I returned home one day with my first graded exam: 95 percent.
I skipped home, test waving in my hand with triumphant joy. My teacher had drawn a smiley face and included lots of exclamation points. Clearly, it said what a gold star could not — I had done fantastic and exceeded expectations. But when my father saw this test, he took one look and then, without a moment’s hesitation, demanded, “Where are the other five points?”
My immigrant parents were often baffled by the American school system. They would come home from work and see me drawing political cartoons and making collages with magazine clippings and thought I was lying if I said it was an assignment due the next day. Sure, they thought this behavior was appropriate for a 7-year-old child struggling to capture her inner self, but a 10th-grader finishing a project for her world history class?
My parents grew up in an environment when studying was the utmost priority. We say that academics takes precedence and it does to an extent, but we could never understand the stress and pressures that my parents experienced. Entrance exams defined one’s life. A test was required for certain elementary schools, for most middle schools and for all high schools and universities. A test was required for graduation from all of these levels of education. Studying for these exams began as a child, with the acquisition of reading and writing skills. It was imperative — it was absolutely necessary — to do one’s very best. Study three months in advance for the SAT? Try studying four years to take a high school entrance exam. To be a doctor was not a choice one made at 18 — it was made for you at 6.
While my parents shed hair from stress and impaired their vision by studying with dim florescent lighting for so many hours of the day, I cramped my neck making political cartoons and collages. We like to complain about midterms, finals and the nauseating beast known as the LSAT, but maybe we’re simply atoning for the multitudes of mindless English lit projects, Spanish body-part songs and PE square-dancing finals we dabbled in.
My cousin in Korea, who is currently a junior in college, once joked that the calluses on her fingers are finally fading after years and years of studying. I heard a girl complaining in my LSAT prep class that she has finally started to grow one on her third finger, right where a pencil rests. What happened to the idea that education was, at the end of the day, the avoidance of manual labor?

Global tax not the answer
In response to Rosaleen O’Sullivan’s Sept. 21 article, “US would benefit from supporting global tax”: It’s unfortunate that some policymakers and citizens believe that creating a global tax on financial transactions will help the world economy recover or prevent future financial crisis.
Simply reallocating money from financial sector transactions into a financial sector bailout or worldwide stimulus fund does not create new economic output.
Remember, Tobin tax revenues come from profits that would either be reinvested or used for consumption anyway. The tax effectively takes efficient capital, squanders some of it with its bureaucracy and then inefficiently reallocates the capital. It also discourages credit transactions, a crucial tool for economy recovery.
Additionally, creating a bailout fund from a Tobin tax would only accelerate speculative behavior; bankers will be more willing to take risk because they know that if they fail, there is a bailout fund waiting for them. Policymakers should take more care to analyze the effects of their policies.
Sometimes government intervention isn’t always the answer.
Richard Graham
Sophomore, business administration
Despite being interesting and informative, I feel like this response might paint an unfair picture on the original premise of the Tobin tax, which was to lower short-term speculation and decrease foreign investment to reduce inflation.
While I’m not sure using this global reserve to fund bail-outs is a wise idea, the possibility of excess funds that could be to support sustainability in struggling 3rd world / developing countries is a prospect that is certainly tantalizing.  Or maybe the revenue could go to developing fair universal labor laws, disease.  The point is there are worthy causes out there which could create global benefits.
Granted its a waste of time to really discuss since its not a realistic option.  Establishing universal support would take a political campaign greater than Obama’s and a media push for an issue that not even Fox News could fabricate.
