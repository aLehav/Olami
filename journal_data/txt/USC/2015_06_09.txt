Fútbol, or soccer as we call it in the United States, is without a doubt Argentina’s most popular sport. Families have supported their various clubs for decades, and the sport is an integral part of the culture and lifestyle of the country.
Though not a day has gone by when I don’t see someone in a fútbol jersey of one of the local teams, I finally got a true feel for the passion this past weekend when I went to see Argentinos Juniors and Quilmes play, my first fútbol match since arriving in Buenos Aires. These are two of the many club teams in Argentina, and each has its loyal following of fans.  While neither of these teams are in the so-called “big five,” the most popular of Argentine club teams, I wouldn’t have realized it based on the fervor and dedication of the fans that surrounded me in the stadium on Friday night.
My friends and I got to the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium early in order to buy tickets.  There were three different areas that we could buy tickets for, and it had been suggested to us that we sit in the general standing area where we could be with all the most passionate fans or “hinchas” who set the energy within the stadium. Two distinct things stood out to me in the ticketing process. First, there was different pricing for general public and “socios,” fans who pay dues to be a club member and had free entry to some seating areas or lower prices.  The second surprise was that the tickets for women were cheaper than tickets for men.  It was very strange to me that I paid less than my guy friends who ended up in the same area I did. Apparently, this is because so few women come to the games, they try to generate more of an incentive with the discounted price.
As we entered the stadium, my heart was filled with the thudding of the drums that set the beat for the chants and songs sang by the hinchas. In the sea of red, the color of the home team, Argentinos Juniors, we made our way to a spot in the standing room. Standing among the fútbol-crazed fans was even more hair-raising than I imagined. It took me a while to let everything sink in as I looked around the stadium that might not have been full but was swelling with the energy of the fans. To the right of where I was sitting was the main area of hinchas, banging their drums and standing on the railings waving the banners and leading the crowd in song. One chant ran into another as everyone sang as they watched the game with intense delight.
Anyone who knows me and my love for sport will be able to understand how all I wanted was to be able to know the songs and sing along with the fans. I joined in the stomping and clapping that continued even when the other team scored the first goal. This was what was most impressive to me, the enthusiasm and passion that did not dwindle even when the team was losing. The only time the crowd sat was during halftime, and even during the second half when they were down 0-2 fans remained standing and stayed until the referee blew the final whistle.
Even though I wasn’t able to experience the feeling of a home team victory, I can only imagine the incredible energy of it. I am so grateful that I was able to see for myself the intensity of the fans even in the face of a loss.
I will admit, however, I did have my reservations about going to a fútbol game because of the problems with fan violence that is often the most emphasized aspect of fútbol in Argentina. Though I admire the passion people have for their teams, I find it difficult to understand why violence has to come of it. Fútbol is truly life or death for many, and it has unfortunately lead to the latter many times throughout history.
Fans pride themselves in being a “barra brava” or an organized supporter, many of whom have reputations for hooliganism.  The most notorious of fans are those who support the Boca Juniors. Their fans refer to themselves as “la 12” or the 12th man (fútbol is played with 11 on the field) because when teams come to play at Boca’s stadium they not only have to focus on playing the actual team but also the fans who are known for their brutal intensity.
The fanaticism of the Boca Juniors hinchas is controversial. The fans are so ferocious that the opposing fans are not allowed to attend games at Boca’s stadium because of how dangerous it can be. In the most recent “superclasico,” the match played between arch rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate, a fan pepper sprayed the opposing players, resulting in an early end to the game because several players were unable to return to the game due to burns all over their body, including their eyes.
While I admire the passion and love for fútbol, this is where I draw the line.  Fanaticism should not interfere with the sport and no matter the rivalry there should be a level of respect among all who appreciate the game.  Aside from the few cases of overly intense fans, I still admire the passion of the fans who do respect the game. I think USC football fans could even take a note from the Argentine fútbol fans the next time they consider leaving the game early or sitting during a third down play.

Remember the pop remix song that had Spongebob Squarepants saying, “I’m ready!” over and over again? Trendy, fun and an entertaining listen — in a hipster kind of way. The band behind this song: AJR. Through their self-produced hit song, the band skyrocketed into America’s Top 40 playlist. And now they are touring with Andy Grammer for the summer. They wrapped up the Los Angeles portion of their tour with a performance at the El Rey Theatre on June 3.
AJR stands for the first names of the members of the band: brothers Adam, Jack and Ryan Met. The three have been singing and creating music together from a young age. As New York natives, they used the streets as their first stage.
Ryan, the middle brother, elaborated on how AJR started as a musical group.
“About 10 years ago, we started off street performing in different parks in New York City. So we went out to Washington Square Park and started doing covers.” Ryan Met said. “And, we ended up raising enough money to buy a ukulele, our first investment that we needed. We bought enough equipment to start recording and producing.”
From their living room, the trio produced an international anthem in 2013. Their breakthrough song, “I’m Ready” has more than 12 million views on YouTube, is certified multi-platinum in Australia and is certified gold in the U.S. The band implemented its own grassroots effort to publicize its sound, including tweeting at multiple celebrities. “I’m Ready” gained the attention of Sia, the female artist behind “Chandelier,” who tweeted it to her fans. Subsequently, AJR’s catchy song garnered massive plays from around the world.
“Social media, like Twitter and YouTube, has been priceless for us. We tweeted our ‘I’m Ready’ video to as many celebrities as we could think of. It changed our entire lives.” Ryan Met said.
“I’m Ready” boasts summer vibes with dance beats. This song is a unique combination of Spongebob and contagious, energetic rhythm and melody.
“It was actually Jack’s idea — he came up with the idea to sample Spongebob Squarepants. He originally thought that an EDM artist should sample Spongebob right before the big dubstep drop. And then we sat with it a couple times, and then we were like we need to do this. This is for us.” Ryan Met said. “We wanted to make a song that just sounded so bizarre and weird that people would know that it couldn’t have been made in a real studio but had to have been made in some guy’s living room.”
AJR is unique in the fact that the band’s EPs, “I’m Ready” and “Infinity,” and their newest album, Living Room, are all self-produced. And their music is definitely not mainstream. An eclectic mashup of folk, hip-hop, EDM and dance, AJR has a distinctive sound among indie pop bands. The Met brothers pride themselves in their niche aesthetic, and their music has developed further as the brothers grow.
“We’ve been doing our own music for a while now. It’s been about eight years of us doing originals, and most of them have not seen the light of day. If you looked at our old stuff, you would see a kind of evolution. We started off doing a lot more folk-y type music, and then we kind of developed into a little bit more hip-hop inspired. And with ‘I’m Ready,’ we had a nice balance of weird pop that we like to listen to.”
Their newest album, Living Room, released in late February, has 13 songs in its set list. It is definitive proof that AJR has matured as a band.
“We wanted Living Room to show growth from [our latest] EPs. We took selected songs that we liked from those EPs, and we wanted our new stuff to really show where AJR was headed and where our sound was headed. We’re already working on stuff for the next record, and I think that it’s very next level.” Ryan Met said. “I think it’s very surprising. I think a lot about what people liked about ‘I’m Ready’ and a lot of our other stuff, is the surprises. As soon as you think the song is going a certain way, the tempo suddenly changes, and it suddenly goes into a different kind of music within the same song.”
On stage at the El Rey Theatre, AJR was energetic and interactive. A fun band to watch, they bounced around the stage and around their instruments. Their stage presence is one of a kind.  The audience at the El Rey responded positively with deafening cheers. Following AJR, Andy Grammer took the stage. After playing some of his most popular songs, Grammer was awarded his platinum record for “Honey, I’m Good” on stage.
AJR was especially excited to open for Grammer, because the brothers have worked with the singer before.
“Andy Grammer is incredible,” Ryan Met said. “We co-wrote his first single ‘Back Home’ with him. And he is just an incredible writer and singer. We were able to watch him perform for the first time in the city. He puts on such a great show.”
The Met brothers have taken the pop music world by storm. Social media helped their successful rise to the Billboard 100, and they hope to continue creating music that listeners will enjoy. Though the brothers also juggle being students, they say music will be taking a priority in the future. The trio is focused on improving, growing as a band and staying unique.
“Advice I would give, in terms of music: Figure out what is unique about you, as an artist. And just embellish that,” Ryan Met said. “That’s what people are looking for, something unique, something that hasn’t been heard before.”

For students looking for an escape from the fast-paced metropolitan lifestyle that comes with the USC territory, Lincoln Park and its Plaza de la Raza cultural center provide an exciting retreat that is easily accessible.
Situated near the USC Health Sciences Campus and along the bus route of USC transit, Lincoln Park/Plaza de la Raza is an oasis — teeming with activity, art, events and unique food stops — all within walking distance. People come from all over to take in the natural beauty of the park including a man-made lake that has become a popular stop for “catch and release” fishing.
Aristo Ceballos, a Pasadena native, bikes 45 minutes from his hometown to fish at Plaza de la Raza.
“It’s therapeutic,” Ceballos said. “A lot of people can [fish] if they’re stressing or maybe going through something. Just being out here is relaxing to your mind.”
Ceballos noted that he caught a 7-pound carp while he was on the lake, while others have claimed to catch fish as big as 19 pounds. Ceballos usually throws the fish back, however, and it is the culture of the community to do the same.
“It’s like a game,” Ceballos noted with a grin. “Like man against nature. The fish has a fighting chance, and you have a chance to bring it in. As long as the fish isn’t hurt, it’s all fun and games.”
Different food shops surround the park, including Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant Cha Cha Chili, Mexican cuisine stop El Huarachito and Dino’s Burgers.
For those interested in skateboarding, Lincoln Park has an extensive skate park loaded with ramps, slaloms and grind rails that have attracted many amateur skateboarders within the community as well as some professionals.
J.J. Rivera, a 25-year-old Puerto Rican native, is a regular at the skate park and noted its influence on his life.
“I like being here because it’s a good environment,” Rivera said. “It’s an open area, and also, you are able to see top-notch pro skaters. You get inspired.”
Some of the pro skaters that frequent the park include Dave Bachinsky, Manny Santiago, Tony Tave and Trevor Colden. Paul “P-Rod” Rodriguez of the Nike SB team has also been sighted on occasion.
Ramon Bernal, senior recreation director of Lincoln Park, noted Nike’s, as well as “P-Rod’s,” involvement in Lincoln Park.
“Nike sponsors four different events throughout the year,” Bernal said. “It’s partially funded by Paul Rodriguez [who] is part of the group that put together the skate park.”
Rivera attended one of the Nike SB events.
“It was cool. It was a Nike SB tour from South America to L.A., and the last stop was here,” Rivera said. “They came around 7 o’clock with a mariachi band.”
Local teens Robert Gulgotuez and Andy Cruz said their celebrity sightings in the area included legendary skateboarder Lance Mountain, who designed the skate park along with the Nike SB team.
In addition to skateboarding, Lincoln Park provides many opportunities for affordable fitness options, including hiking trails, free fitness equipment, tennis courts, basketball courts, baseball/soccer fields and cardio boot camp classes.
Nora Aparicio, a Lincoln Park recreation assistant, talked about her time as a student in the cardio boot camp classes.
“My experience was amazing,” Aparicio said. “It’s very tough. It requires a lot of dedication.”
For those interested in the arts, Plaza de la Raza provides community art classes as well as events that are open to the public.
“Plaza does quite a few events throughout the year,” Bernal said. “Different types of music events, such as Ska Wars, and international cultural events.”
The Plaza de la Raza cultural center also has an art school that targets low-income, high-risk youth in the community and has worked in collaboration with CalArts, Disney, Target and American Apparel, among others to provide a safe haven for youth to grow as artists. Volunteers are always welcome at this facility as well as at Lincoln Park’s recreation center.  Anyone interested in volunteering can contact the center for more information.
“We are always in need of coaches for sports,” Bernal said. “You don’t have to be a professional or college player. You just need to know a little more than the kids.”

There are few sports figures more polarizing than LeBron James in today’s sports world.  Yes, there’s Alex Rodriguez, known steroid user; Tiger Woods, cheating husband; and Ray Rice, infamous wife beater, but LeBron doesn’t have the same off-court issues that any of these superstars do.  He is a family man, well-spoken and polite to reporters.
The issue that James is perhaps most famous for came nearly five years ago in the nationally televised ESPN program “The Decision.”  He then decided to “take [his] talents to South Beach,” deserting his home state of Ohio and betraying Cavs fans.  To add fuel to the fire — fans were actually burning jerseys in the street — in a flashy display of star power,  James was introduced to Miami with new teammates Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh and promised not three, not four, but many more titles with what Wade called, “arguably the best trio to ever play the game of basketball.”
This cockiness, this direct disrespect to the city of Cleveland, is why everyone hates LeBron James.  No one wanted to see the Miami Heat assemble a dominating force that knew how good it was and could demolish everyone in the NBA.  And they didn’t.  Miami won                 back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013, but that was the extent of the dynasty’s wins.  They made finals appearances in 2011 and again in 2014, but both were losing efforts.
Now LeBron is back in his home town, after a heartfelt letter published in Sports Illustrated explained how Miami was to him what college is to many kids in America: an opportunity to fly the nest and experience life outside of the reaches of home — a phase in life where you are granted the opportunity to grow and make mistakes.
“My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn’t realize that four years ago. I do now,” LeBron said in the letter, written by Sports Illustrated’s Lee Jenkins.
So has LeBron earned back the city of Cleveland’s love and trust?  Absolutely.  Partly, of course, because he is the best basketball player in the world, but also partly because he has grown up and matured.
LeBron James is an underappreciated basketball player. He is averaging 41.6 minutes a game and 29.3 points.  His shooting was unimpressive in Game 2 of the current NBA Finals, but he still finished with a triple double.  His numbers are off the charts, and yet most of the country is rooting against The King.
James has once again put the Cavaliers on his back and forced them into the finals without two of their star players, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The team had been written off for this series when Kyrie went down with a fractured knee cap at the end of Game 1, but behind LeBron James, the Cavaliers were able to hold off a surging Warriors team in their own arena and pull off the overtime win.
Sure the Warriors are fresh and new, and the Splash Brothers, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, are arguably the most entertaining combination in the entire NBA.  They deserve a championship just as much as anyone else, and when the series is over we’ll see who the winner of this hard-fought series will be.
But, the Chosen One has made his choice. “Our city hasn’t had that feeling in a long, long, long time. My goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what’s most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio,” states James’ Sports Illustrated letter.
So why are we all still rooting against him?

No. 13 USC men’s golf was the runner-up on June 3rd at the NCAA Championship Match Play final at the Concession Golf Course in Bradenton, Florida, falling 4-1 to No. 9 LSU. This was a program-best finish for the Trojans. They had previously finished in third place seven times.
The Trojans have not advanced to the match play bracket since 2009 — its previous lone appearance, which was a quarterfinal loss to Michigan. USC had not won a match play since this format was introduced in 2009.
To get to the championship match, the Trojans qualified for the match play after finishing fifth following 72 holes of stroke play.
In the semifinal, USC completed one of its best days in program history after edging out No. 4 Illinois                3-1-1. Impressive finishes from senior Eric Sugimoto, Rico Hoey and Bobby Gojuangco lead the Trojans to the upset victory over the top-seeded Illinois.
“We had an up-and-down season, but the talent was there,” Sugimoto said. “The flashes of brilliance were just everywhere, everywhere you look.”
In the championship, falling 4-1 to LSU, Sugimoto earned the Trojans’ only point in the match.
“It’s been a great week, I’m proud of the guys,” Sugimoto said. “It’s been a really great experience, something I’ll remember for the rest of my life.”
With Sugimoto as the lone senior on the roster, ninth-year head coach Chris Zambri was pleased with his performance at the NCAA Championships.
“[Sugimoto’s] going to leave college golf with his head super high because he was phenomenal this week for us,” Zambri said. “He came through on the four biggest days of the year.”
Zambri was both “bummed” and proud about the program’s runner-up finish.
“Yeah, second place is way better than third and everything after it,” Zambri said. “But, it’s tough to get into this position, so when you get here, you want to get it done.”
The last time Zambri got this close to winning the title was back in 2008, when USC finished third by two strokes the year before the match play bracket was instituted.
After leading the Trojans to their best-ever finish at the NCAA Championships, Zambri was named the 2015 Golf Coaches Association of America West Region Coach of the Year. He has led the Trojans to the NCAA Championships every year as a head coach.
This was the second GCAA Region of the Year honor for Zambri, the previous in 2008.
This season, the Trojans won three tournaments among eight top-three finishes. Crocker earned      Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors, was named to the All-Pac-12 first team and earned PING All-West Region honors. Hoey also earned All-Pac-12 first team honors and PING All-West Region honors with stellar play this season.

It is the 13th century B.C. The Greeks have entered the impenetrable walls of Troy after a 10-year siege. The beloved Helen has been returned to King Menelaus, and the Greek forces have completed the sack of Troy. The fall of Troy will be written into history by Homer and preserved for eternity in the epic tales of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Fast-forward to  2015. Centuries have passed since the fall of Troy, but their  destined reign  is all but forgotten. In the fall, the Men of Troy will again step onto the battlefield, but the war of 2015 is hardly the second coming of the Trojan War. The kingdom of Troy is once again after the coveted Helen, though she now comes in the form of a golden badge of honor that will forever rest within the walls of Heritage Hall.
The fallen hero Paris has been replaced by a spritely and experienced leader who traded his weapons for a pigskin. The people of Troy have faith that this young hero will lead the Trojans to victory once more. This captain and quarterback is none other than Cody Kessler.
Kessler and his cohorts are under the direction of second-year head coach Steve Sarkisian, who led the Trojans to a 9-4 season in 2014. Though it is an improvement from years past, Sarkisian and the Trojans are in search of a perfect season.
The upcoming term  will feature some hard fought battles for the Trojans.
In their quest for victory, the Trojans will have to ward off attacks on the homefront by the Cardinals and the Bruins. The Trojans have remained undefeated  against the Cardinals in the past two seasons, though both games have come down to the final minutes. The rival Bruins have had no problem defeating the Trojans recently, but this year they will be without quarterback Brett Hundley, who has entered the NFL.
The Trojans will also  need to go behind enemy lines to secure wins over the Fighting Irish and the Ducks. Last season, the Trojans easily put the Irish to rest at the Coliseum, but they will have to win in South Bend this year. The Ducks pose what will likely be the most difficult battle of 2015. Though their Heisman-winning quarterback has also  entered  the NFL, the Ducks run a precise system offense that hasn’t wavered, regardless of who was calling plays.
Kessler will be flanked by veterans Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu Smith, last year’s breakout stars. Jackson is a triple threat who excels on offense, defense and special teams. He appeared in all 13 games for the Trojans last year, starting 10 times at cornerback and once at wide receiver. He had 49 tackles, including four for losses, 10 deflections, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery on defense. Offensively, he had 10 receptions for 138 yards with three touchdowns and one carry for five yards. On special teams he had 23 kickoff returns for 684 yards with two touchdowns and two punt returns for 12 yards. Smith also earned his stripes last season, though he was only the second receiver, behind Nelson Agholor. Like Jackson, Smith appeared in all 13 games, starting 12 times. He had 54 receptions for 724 yards with five touchdowns. On special teams, he had 11 kickoff returns for 132 yards and five tackles.
Design by Mollie Berg.
Sarkisian also has a highly regarded brigade of new Trojans who could see time on the field this season. Sarkisian brought in a quartet of five-star recruits: defensive back Iman Marshall, linebacker Osa Masina, defensive lineman Rasheem Green and offensive lineman Chuma Edoga. USC also signed 15 four-star recruits and seven three-star recruits.
The veterans and newcomers alike will be united under the leadership and poise of Kessler, who caught the nation’s attention last season. In 2014 Kessler had a record-setting season. While starting all 13 games, he completed 315-of-452 passes (69.7 percent) for 3,826 yards. He boasted 39 touchdowns and just five interceptions. He has already received Heisman buzz, and if he can improve on his win count in 2015, he stands an excellent chance of winning.
Sarkisian now has a year of experience under his belt, a quarterback with two years of starting experience and a handful of impact players on both sides of the ball. The lack of depth caused by the NCAA sanctions was very obvious in the final minutes of USC’s 2014 losses. The new recruiting class should complement the core of returners and add a much-needed depth to the roster.
Behind the arm and leadership of Kessler, the Trojans are poised to restore dominance to Troy.

A week ago, Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner, came out as a transgender woman in a cover article in Vanity Fair. Jenner made headlines in the New York Times and the Washington Post and will receive an award for her courage at ESPN’s annual ESPY awards show. But though the response from the international media was largely positive, not everyone has been as receptive.
Users on the forum site, 4chan,  who could charitably be described as online “trolls,” started a petition last week to “Revoke Caitlyn Jenner’s Olympic medals” on the site Change.org. The petition, which has close to 15,000 signatures, insidiously asks the International Olympic Committee to revoke Ms. Jenner’s medals because when she competed in 1976, she was really a woman and thus should have been competing in the women’s division instead of the men’s.
The petition itself seems nothing more than ignorant hate directed toward a gifted athlete and brave individual. Trolls on 4chan have a long and sordid history of pulling stunts “for the lulz,” such as encouraging iPhone users to microwave their phones and spreading the hashtag “#Cut4Bieber” to encourage girls to mutilate themselves.
This petition further ignores Caitlyn Jenner’s reality and the reality of any transgender person. Though Caitlyn was defined as a male at birth and has been known as “Bruce” for most of her life, her experiences and qualifications prior to the transition should not be perceived any differently now that she is gendered as a woman. She might have competed in the Olympics in 1976 with Bruce’s identity, but Caitlyn still deserves her decathlon medals. New information about her gender identity does not change or invalidate her prowess in sports 40 years ago.
There are legitimate reasons to revoke a person’s medals or championships after the competition is over. Baseball player Barry Bonds will forever have an asterisk by his name because he used steroids. Cyclist Lance Armstrong was stripped of his record seven consecutive Tour de France wins because of blood doping. Unlike Bonds and Armstrong, however, Jenner’s gender identity did not give her an unfair advantage in 1976.  She competed against the best athletes in the world with similar physical and hormonal make-ups. While Bonds and Armstrong injected banned substances to get an edge over their competition, Jenner did not.
Just because a person comes out as transgender and reveals his or her inner self does not mean that person has been lying or cheating. Classifications for sports competitions are based on physical attributes, not gender identity. In 1976, Caitlyn Jenner had the body of an incredibly athletic man, despite identifying as a woman. Thus, Jenner competed with the men and set a world record when she beat them all at the Olympic games. Jenner gained no competitive edge from her gender identity during competition and should not be penalized after the fact.
Unfortunately, some women have been penalized or have had their privacy invaded because of hormonal imbalances or fears that men will compete as women. In 2014, Indian sprinter Dutee Chand was barred from international competition because she had hyperandrogenism, a medical condition where the body produces too many androgens, leading to male development in vertebrates. The Athletic Federation of India ruled that Chand’s high levels of androgens gave her an unfair advantage. FIFA has made it mandatory to perform “gender testing” on women currently playing in the 2015 Women’s World Cup to ensure that they are actually female, and not just men masquerading as women to give their national teams a competitive edge. Female testing, which Stanford bioethicist Katrina Karkazis described as inaccurate, discriminatory and “a solution in search of a problem” is invasive and offensive to women who have lived and competed as women their entire lives.
The big distinction between men and women with hormonal imbalances or who are transgendered and people like Bonds and Armstrong is that the latter make conscious and malicious attempts to cheat in their sports. Chand is not a cheater because she medically cannot regulate the androgens in her body. Jenner did not cheat because she did not use banned substances to alter her chemical makeup in ’76. Bond and Armstrong, however, used banned substances.
International sports regulators still need to find better solutions to allowing athletes like Chand to compete. Inevitably, there will also be athletes who are transgendered at the highest levels, just as there are Girl Scouts, actors, and soldiers who are transgender. Athletics, 4chan and society will just have to adapt and be more accepting.

USC will play host to both athletes and events of the Special Olympics Summer Games coming to Los Angeles at the end of July.
The Games will be held from July 25 to Aug. 2 and will kick off with a grand opening ceremony on the evening of July 25 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is incidentally the only venue in the world to have hosted two Summer Olympics, in 1932 and 1984. It has also played host to two Super Bowls, I and VII, and one World Series, in 1959. This is Los Angeles’s second Special Olympics, the previous one being held in 1999.
Nearly 7,000 athletes will compete for glory in these games across 25 sporting disciplines spread across 27 venues. Aquatics, basketball and track and field will be held at USC at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, Galen Center and Cromwell Field, respectively.
The Special Olympics began as an initiative of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of former President John. F. Kennedy, who started the Special Olympics as a way of breaking barriers for individuals with intellectual disabilities. What began in Chicago in 1968 is now a movement that encompasses more than 170 countries around the world and touches millions of lives.
The last Summer Games were held in Athens in 2011.  The next Special Olympics World Games event will be the Winter Games, to be held in Graz and Schladming in Austria in 2017.
Though no formal announcements have been made about the opening ceremony, Steven Vanderpool, senior vice president of communications and media operations for the Los Angeles Special Olympics 2015, said that it’s being handled like similarly large-scale events.
“We’ve roped in Five Currents, a production firm based in Redondo Beach, for the ceremonies. They have extensive expertise in handling events of such scale, and they’ve handled ceremonies for World Cups and even the London Summer Olympics among others,” Vanderpool said. “But the marquee event of that evening will be the march of the 7,000 athletes who are going to be participating in these games.”
Vanderpool confirmed that the ceremony would be a three-hour event that will be broadcast worldwide on the ESPN network.
Vanderpool said that upon the athletes’ arrival, they will be integrated into the local communities as part of the “Host Town” program of the games.
“We’ve been running this program since 1995 and as part of this initiative, more than 100 communities across Southern California stretching all the way to San Luis Obispo have been engaged to help athletes feel comfortable and experience local cultures and hospitality,” Vanderpool said.
Paige Peplow, a recent USC graduate, will be taking part in one of these Host Town programs in San Pedro. Peplow has been teaching dance classes to children with Down syndrome for the past eight years and has been asked to choreograph a dance for her students to perform at a dinner for athletes in San Pedro.
“I’m so honored to be a part of the Special Olympics organization because it’s an organization that is close to my heart,” Peplow said. “It’s especially great because I’ve been able to experience two of my worlds colliding with USC hosting the games.”
Peplow became involved in the Special Olympics through a contact she had met through the Marshall School of Business.
“It really happened completely by accident. I was put in touch with a Marshall alumna and had told her about my experience teaching dance to kids with Down syndrome, and the next thing I knew, one of the Host Town programs was asking me to help with the proceedings,” Peplow said. “I’m so grateful for this whole experience, and it has just been another example of the strength of the Trojan family.”
Transportation arrangements for athletes have been paramount to organizers, given the scale of events and the fact that the venues are spread across L.A.
“Keeping the travel to a bare minimum for the athletes is vital, and USC and UCLA will be our athletes’ villages for the games,” Vanderpool said. “During the games, two thirds of the delegates, totaling nearly 6,500 in number, [will] be staying at USC and the rest [will] be camped at UCLA.”
The organizers also realize the importance of having enthusiastic supporters in the stands, and the Fans In The Stands initiative aims to ensure just that. These Special Olympics will see volunteers captaining teams of spectators in the stands and doing their part to create an environment that will help athletes excel.
Tickets for the Opening Ceremony went on sale on June 2. Vanderpool said he is extremely pleased with the response thus far and is confident that Los Angeles will be able to deliver a successful and memorable games.

Due to USC hosting the Special Olympics, some freshman orientation sessions will take place off-campus for the first time.
There will be six on-campus sessions, including one for international students in the middle of August, and eight off-campus freshmen orientation sessions, including three sessions in China. The off-campus sessions for freshmen within the U.S. will be held in New York, Chicago, San Mateo, Sacramento and Dallas. The international freshman off-campus sessions abroad will be in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. Current students who returned home for the summer to these specific locations were selected to help out with the sessions.
The on-campus freshman orientations begin on June 11, with the last session being held on August 17. The off-campus freshman orientation sessions began May 30 in Chicago and New York and will finish in Dallas on July 18.
Additionally, the university will offer three on-campus orientation sessions for transfer students. There will be no off-campus sessions offered for transfer students.
Lisa Starr, director of Orientation Programs, discussed the main differences of the new orientation format.  Some of the changes include moving some of the mandatory activities, originally done during Welcome Week, to the first day of the session instead.
“The ‘Talk About It’ sessions, that are about forming healthy relationships and the idea of consent in relationships, were mandatory for the first time last year for freshmen coming in, and they were held during Welcome Week,” she said. “But now we’re going to be able to have smaller sessions during orientation and break up into small discussion groups with their orientation advisors later and just have the chance to really talk about it more than they were able to last year.”
The structure for Welcome Week will be similar to ones held in past years, but the program will be adding more activities for students and will additionally be revamping its database and website.
Starr also emphasized that the idea of orientation was for students to get better acclimated initially, and to assist them in having a healthy approach to their first few months at school.
“We’ve restructured the student activities fairs and resources for students so that they understand that they need to manage their time and figure out what works best for them. We want them to have a healthy first year experience,” she said.
Amy Suto, an orientation coordinator, also believes that the new structure allows for incoming students to get to know their advisors better during O-Group discussion, rather than just providing them with all the information.
“We’ll be doing more team-building exercises with the groups,” she said. “We will also have the students sign up for individual appointments with their orientation advisors to better connect them with resources and help them get a great start at USC.”
For new int’l students, a
new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that aids anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About
America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People,
Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright
student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors.
It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they contributed
to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be
accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture,
friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after
graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to
get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to
work for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most
common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily
overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to
succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in
their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments,
immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students,
and books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win
situation.  Good luck in your new school!
