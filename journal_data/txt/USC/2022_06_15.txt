USC Track & Field athletes hung up their cleats and can now catch their breath after finishing their seasons at the 2022 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Saturday. The men’s team tied with Washington for 12th place and the women’s at 30th, wrapping up the 2021-2022 USC athletic calendar.
The men’s 4x100m relay team achieved a school record en route to clinching the national title. Graduate student Kasaun James, senior Brendon Stewart, sophomore Ashton Allen and sophomore Johnnie Blockburger won the event title and secured a school-record time of 38.49. Their time broke a 2015 record set by a team featuring USC football star Adoree Jackson, now a cornerback for the New York Giants. The runners earned first-team All-American honors with their performance.
“We were thinking why not us?” said Stewart in an interview with USC Athletics. “No one really expected us to win. Everybody was ranked ahead of us. We trusted our training, we trusted each other, we ran for Davonte (Burnett who was injured at Pac-12s), we came here ready to go to war.”
The 4x100m relay was USC’s only first place finish of the championships. The victory scored 10 points for the men’s team, accounting for half of its total points scored in the week. 
The 4x400m relay team secured the second-fastest time in school history, running the event in 2:59.98 and earning 8 points for USC. The team finished second in the event behind Florida, which won the NCAA Outdoor Championships for both men and women. Graduate student Zach Shinnick and junior Nicholas Ramey joined Blockburger and James on the team, finishing just 0.98 seconds behind the school-record set in 2018.
Shinnick, following the completion of his last collegiate race, reflected on his career at USC. 
“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in my five years, but if I could go back to [being] a high school senior, I wouldn’t change anything,” Shinnick said. “I’d still come to USC regardless of the ups and downs just because the ups have been some of the best moments of my life.”
Rounding out the scoring for the men’s team was senior Tade Ojora and sophomore Trey Knight. Ojora placed eighth in the 110m hurdles, earning a point for USC. Knight added another, finishing in eighth place in the hammer throw, hurling the 16-pound hammer 70.73 meters. 
All 8 points for the women’s track & field team came from sophomore Jasmine Jones, who placed second on the final day of the tournament in the women’s 100m hurdles. Jones’ performance continued USC’s success in the event, as the sophomore became the third consecutive Trojan to finish in the top two of the 100m hurdles with a time of 12.66 seconds, just 0.09 seconds behind LSU’s Alia Armstrong. 
“Being the last one to race for our team this week, it really just meant a lot to bring the trophy home, bring the gold home, bring whatever I could home, just leave it on the track and do the best I could, which I did,” Jones said in an interview with USC Athletics. “I feel really blessed to have made it to the end of this race honestly, and to place second is honestly a dream come true.”
Jones’ performance beat her previous personal best time, which she had set just days before in the semifinal. Her semifinal time of 12.72 moved her from sixth to fourth on USC’s all-time leaderboard. Freshman Jalaysiya Smith placed fourth in the same event with a personal record of 13.05, finishing best among freshmen who had participated in the NCAA Championships this summer. 
“For me, it’s just an unbelievable year, and I’m just blessed and grateful for it,” James said.

Two tall figures walk the streets of the University Park campus. If you listen in, you can hear them speaking to each other — in German. They’re talking about their packed schedules, practices and school assignments.
You get a glance at the tags on their backpacks: “Simon Gallas” and “Emilia Weske.” They’re USC volleyball players.
Gallas and Weske made the same leap of faith: leaving their home country of Germany, completely oblivious to what life would be like in the United States, for the opportunity to compete in the sport they love and earn a college degree. Now, they’re reaping the benefits. 
“It was pretty much like a blind shot, but I don’t think it was a bad blind shot,” Gallas said. “It was a full-on hit.”
Neither Gallas nor Weske had ever been to USC before they enrolled. Moreover, neither had stepped foot in America. There were no fancy recruiting trips with photo ops and opportunities to meet coaches in person; instead, just flights to Los Angeles International Airport and a drive to campus. 
“Just arriving at this new place, not knowing anybody, it was definitely an adventurous period of time,” Weske said.
Volleyball has long been on the back burner in terms of national attention in Germany, oftentimes overshadowed by sports such as soccer. 
Even Gallas, whose parents met playing volleyball, said he started off playing soccer and basketball before switching to his current sport, while Weske started out as a gymnast.
One common thread that brought them to the sport? Their heights.
“I was always quite the tallest in my classes,” Gallas, who stands today at 6 feet 8 inches, said. 
“It [turned] out I was growing so tall,” Weske, now 6 feet 2 inches, said. “People were like, ‘Hey, you look like you could be really good at volleyball.’”
The recruiting process was a blur for Gallas and Weske. Neither took official recruiting visits, instead talking with coaches and coordinating their applications through them.
Gallas was sold on playing at USC after having in-depth conversations about team strategy with coaches where he said he felt “very welcomed and sought after.” Head Coach Jeff Nygaard would wake up at 5 a.m. on the West Coast to call Gallas.
“[Nygaard] wanted to see what I think about the game,” Gallas said. “I would’ve never expected him to talk to me at that time … That’s something that I really enjoyed … Nobody has ever talked to me about volleyball like that.” 
For Weske, USC’s women’s volleyball associate head coach JJ Van Niel helped guide her through the application process after she committed. 
Van Niel tried to make her recruitment normal despite the circumstances.
“I even did a tour of campus with my phone,” Van Niel said. “It’s the one and only time in my college coaching career that I’ve recruited someone without ever having them visit the campus.”
Weske said things were up in the air up until the last moment. 
“It was a really uncertain process. I didn’t know really if it was gonna work out,” Weske said. “When I finally got my visa and booked the flight, that’s when it hit me. My family [was] like, ‘Oh shit, it’s happening.’”
The two first met in person during orientation week in Fall 2019. Gallas’ family flew out to L.A. with him, but Weske’s didn’t. She tagged along and, for the week, assumed the role of “the extra daughter.”
“It really makes all the difference when you have a person you can talk to in your native language,” Weske said of Gallas.
Navigating through college life is hard enough as it is. Now, add the complexity of solidifying another language and immersing yourself in another culture. Then, add not knowing anyone and having to start anew with friendships. 
They didn’t pick the easiest subjects to study, either — Gallas is majoring in biological sciences, Weske in environmental science and health.
Slowly, though, the two began to assimilate. 
“[My teammates have] definitely welcomed me well,” Gallas said. “The idea that we are equal, all players of the same team with the same goal, that idea forges us into one.”
For Weske, though, it wasn’t as seamless. She remembered she “was so uncomfortable” and “did not know how to act” at her first team photoshoot. Yet, it was a team retreat to Malibu over a meal of s’mores (a first for her) where Weske had her epiphany.
“From pretty early on, people were very supportive and there for me,” Weske said. “For me personally, something clicked, and I was like, ‘Wow, I feel like I’m in the right place right now.’”
L.A. posed some stark contrasts to Bühl and Potsdam, Gallas’ and Weske’s respective hometowns. The two quickly picked up on some differences in the styles of living in the U.S. 
“In Germany, it’s like everyone is in their bubble,” Gallas said. “They stay in their groups, but [in L.A.], it’s way more open. There’s nobody that wouldn’t talk to you if you talk to them.” 
Over the course of their time in L.A., Weske and Gallas have blended into American culture. 
“When people see us talk German, they’re like, ‘Oh, I actually forgot that you guys are not from here,’” Weske said. “People always forget because [we’re] in that environment where you’re that Americanized person all the time.”
However, the two still make it their goal to preserve their German heritage. Weske maintains her love for German rap and Gallas cooks spätzle, an egg noodle and the dish he called “the  German food,” every so often. 
“I don’t think that you ever grow out of it,” he said. “You just add to your German culture.”
Gallas and Weske are established now. They’re two of the biggest contributors to their respective teams, making history for USC volleyball. 
Weske, the first German to ever play for USC women’s volleyball, is proud to be a trailblazer. 
“I feel honored,” she said. “I think it’s a great opportunity to make history and to bring a piece of my culture into this place but also continue this legacy fueled by my culture.”
Her individual production speaks for itself. Weske posted 367.5 points and 303 kills in 2021, both the second-most for the Trojans. 
“We view her as an integral piece of our team, both on the court and off the court,” Van Niel said.
But Weske isn’t satisfied with just her own accolades, especially given that the team finished the season 15-15.
“It doesn’t sit right with me,” she said. “I think there’s a lot of work to do … There’s some frustration about last year. I’m really stoked to be playing another season here and make up for that.”
Gallas came at the right time for the men’s volleyball program. For a team that had just one winning season since 2016, his play this year helped propel the Trojans to a 22-7 record. This season, Gallas led the team with 453 kills.
“I’m just one of the 22 guys on the team,” he said. “I couldn’t be kill leader without [my teammates] … It’s their achievement as much as mine.”
Gallas and Weske took chances to get to where they are now. Nothing was guaranteed, and for both, there’s no question as to whether their choices paid off. 
“Of course it’s worth it,” Gallas said. “I think it’s needless to say … You definitely earn what you sow in the end.”
Their journeys across the world to play volleyball exemplify the uniting power of sport. 
“Sports [are] a great way to connect people across all different cultures, backgrounds and interests,” Weske said. “If you share that one common passion around a sport, that can only create bonds that last.”

As a constant fixture in the top ranks of the nation’s universities, USC — along with many other elite schools — has long been a prime setting for academic burnout among students competing for grades and opportunities. 
Burnout, generally defined as “a physical or mental collapse caused by overwork or stress,” has many identifiable symptoms, including but not limited to a lack of motivation, frustration, decreased productivity, low morale and difficulty concentrating. 
Certain characteristics of one’s work environment — including a lack of autonomy, an overwhelming workload or a destructive level of competitiveness among co-workers and students — play a large role in breeding burnout, according to Dr. Summer Zapata, a clinical psychologist and clinical assistant professor of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine.     
“When you’re in an environment where you’re being either micromanaged or there’s limited flexibility, whether it’s in your time or deadlines or things like that, that can also lead to burnout,” Zapata said.
Another cause of burnout extends past being overloaded, restricted or limited — burnout can also arise when an individual loses a sense of agency in the work they do, Zapata said. 
“When you feel like you’re not making meaningful change or when you’ve lost your sense of meaning or purpose, that can also lead to burnout,” Zapata said. 
Aileen Cha, a rising sophomore majoring in biochemistry, said she has dealt with many symptoms of burnout since high school and found it difficult to remember her purpose during the spring 2022 semester. 
“There are definitely moments during the long periods of lacking motivation [where] I do question myself like, ‘What is the point of all this?’” Cha said.
Burnout has also affected some students with a non-traditional USC experience, including Audrey Irvine, a spring admit and rising sophomore majoring in health and human sciences. Irvine said her burnout symptoms included losing motivation to get ahead of homework and long readings.
“The transition to USC was a lot harder than I thought, especially with the giant feeder classes,” Irvine said. “Getting used to a harder workload hit me harder than I thought it would, so I got burnt out a lot easier than I thought I would.”
Students preparing to enter the workforce can overcome symptoms of burnout and academic exhaustion by being thoughtful about the work environments they choose, engaging in self-care and spending active time focusing on positive, energizing personal relationships, Zapata said.
“It’s very important to really focus on what’s your purpose and move toward things that you really value,” Zapata said.
Cha said that reaching out to not only friends but other people in her classes helped relieve some of her burnout as well.
“I definitely lean on my friends for support just because I know we’re all on the same journey,” Cha said.                              
Alongside focusing on these relationships, Zapata recommended strategies to help combat burnout through a better work-life balance.
“It’s really important to have healthy boundaries with work,” said Zapata, citing habits that can create a more distinct line between free time and work, including not checking your email after a certain time of the day and taking sporadic breaks with rejuvenating activities that increase your energy and attention span, rather than zoning out while using social media.
Equally as important as self-led changes in a student’s working lifestyle is reaching out to a mental healthcare provider whenever necessary, Zapata said; USC’s Student Health Fee provides counseling services through Keck, and Keck’s mental health response network is available to those in-state throughout the summer and academic year both in-person and through Telehealth. If a student is out-of-state but wishes to take advantage of mental health resources over the summer, USC will provide referrals to connect students to providers in their area. 
According to Dr. Suh Chen Hsiao, a clinical associate professor of field education in social work who focuses on healthy aging and mental wellness, the key to managing burnout and maintaining mental health as students prepare to enter the workforce is dealing with their programs’ expectations in their own time and pacing themselves rather than treating academia as a race against others. 
“Stress can be good, but on the other hand, if you take on too much for your situation right now, you’re not 100% to the level where you can address it or tackle it,” Hsiao said.
Additionally, knowing how to recognize limitations and being unafraid to reach out to mental health resources is important for a student’s success, she said. 
“You want a wonderful learning opportunity. You want to be successful. You want to be able to get ready to go into workforce development,” Hsiao said. “The crucial point is knowing when to ask for help.”

Between working a minimum wage job, hunting for internships and intently waiting to binge the next volume of “Stranger Things,” there is still time to social media stalk that special someone — and/or embark on a spontaneous rendezvous before the summer is over.
Embrace the low stakes that accompany a momentary summer romance, which might just follow a meet-cute,rom-com, “The Notebook”-esque plot.
Here’s a playlist of new and old songs to enhance the fervor of your summer fling (or immerse you vicariously into one). Hopefully the lovestruck paradise you find is not as fleeting as this ten tune list.
“Sparks Fly” by Taylor Swift
Unfortunately, there is no time to wait for a rerecording of Swift’s 2010 album, “Sparks Fly,” to enjoy this track along with a heart-warming, youthful lover for the summer. The twang of Swift’s old country, enunciated singing won’t fail to make you gush — and sing along — to this narrative of a heated burst of lively “sparks.” This song is the antidote to the partner who is “reckless that should send [her] running.” The clouded, yet innocent blinding love encapsulates the hesitancy to pursue a summer fling – knowing it will likely end in … sparks.
“Feels Like” by Gracie Abrams
The early stages of an overwhelming and perhaps unknown territory of romance with the clock ticking are perfectly imagined by this track. It provides the possibility of romance in the merely mundane; Abrams references the cold train leaving Connecticut, matching clothes, playing music on phones and not leaving the apartment. Although these are typical, extravagant elements of a whirlwind romance, these lyrics and rising tempo allow listeners to recognize that “living in a movie [you’ve] watched” could be a culmination of the little things you endear about someone.
“Kiss Me” by Sixpence None the Richer
This timeless 1997 song perfectly transports you into a small-town romance followed by a little rendezvous “beneath the milky twilight … on the moonlit floor.” With the crisp nighttime air and roaming under the moon’s natural sparkle, this tune will surely convince you to give in to your urges to make that move — that kiss — on a special someone.
“Electric Love” by BØRNS
It appears Taylor Swift’s sparks have turned into blazing electricity! The upbeat tempo and electric guitar of this song reflects the singer’s rare luck in finding “lightning in a bottle” (or the love that he has been scouring for); this fiery electricity struck him by surprise and hopefully this spontaneous and unexpected spark lands in your bottle this summer.
“Daylight” by Harry Styles
Styles’ newly released album, “Harry’s House,” illustrates a thoughtful timeline of falling in love and slowly drifting away from that person who once was your metaphorical home. Here, we’ll focus on the honeymoon stage with the fifth track of 13. The running feeling of joyous outbursts throughout this song emphasizes his adoration for his partner in stating that “if I was a bluebird, I would fly to you / You’d be the spoon / Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you” in the pre-chorus. However, these loving lyrics are interrupted by intense instrumentals that demonstrate the uncontrollable passion for this person — a foreshadowing of the love dwindling. This serotonin-inducing track with a slight hint of trouble is a perfect fit for a fleeting summer fling.
“Perfect” by One Direction
Has that summer fling turned into unrequited love? One Direction has the perfect song for you with the five men pining and attempting to compel their lovers to stay with them by listing boundless possibilities whilstsinging: “And if you like midnight driving with the windows down / And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce / If you like to do whatever you’ve been dreaming about / Then baby, you’re perfect.”
“The Louvre” by Lorde
Traveling abroad or to another city this summer? Lorde,with beautiful imagery and metaphors, will create the backdrop for you and your lover in a picturesque city. Although she overthinks “punctuation use” — as many of us do — and regards herself as a “sweetheart psychopathic crush,” she believes their love is worthy of hanging in the Louvre. The ominous instrumental at the end of the track leaves room for uncertainty — a temporary summer fling.
“Are You Bored Yet?” by the Wallows ft. Clairo
It’s time to ask that looming question. Although it’s sonically dreamy and uplifting imagining a coming-of-age beachside indie movie,the lyrics suggest boredom and insecurity in their romantic partner. A sun-filled lighthearted romance is passionate but it’s implied to last for only a brief moment in time. The track concludes with Dylan Minette and Clairo begging one another to “tell the truth, so [they] don’t have to lie.”
“Die for You” by The Weeknd
As this playlist has been a timeline for falling in love with a summer fling, with pre-cognizance it will end, there is that possibility for the fire to be reignited. Abel’s 2016 R&B pop song is filled with pleas of passion and lust to convince a former lover to return. The tension and tempo build up to a climactic chorus revealing that he would “die for” his lover and that “the distance and the time between [them] / It’ll never change [his] mind.” Whether you’ve cut ties with your summer love who was merely a fling or holding onto the thread of possibility that they’re “the one”, this song will leave you pondering a long time after.
“Altar” by Kehlani
Although Kehlani wrote this song for a love who has passed away, a slightly more optimistic, metaphorical interpretation can be instated for the loss of a summer “love” or fling. Whether it’s the time, place, or circumstance, love can be ephemeral; hence, the singer’s plea to “put [her love] on the altar, stay just a little bit longer.”

Summer just means more time to wallow in social media — for me, at least. Amid my mindless scrolling through TikTok, I came across a video by @TallNeil discussing Prada’s newest accessory.
The enamel pin of their logo, with Saffiano leather trim that comes in four colors — black, “sunny yellow,” “mango” and “papaya” — costs $300 each. So, why is this pin up for discussion? Because it has unofficially inspired the “infinite Prada hack,” wherein one can secure the pin to any bag and technically call it a Prada bag.
While the comments are inevitably filled with confusion over why a small pin is $300, this brings to the forefront the idea of buy-ins for the brand. As @TallNeil stated so clearly in his TikTok, “[Prada] is basically saying, if you want to be a Prada girlie, the buy-in is 300 bucks.” 
$300. It sounds like a lot, but in comparison to the average prices of Prada pieces as well as the versatility of the pin, it’s actually quite small. They sell nylon picnic baskets for $3,750, bucket hats for $895, claw clips for $495 and terry-cloth or re-nylon scrunchies for $380. 
The pin allows everything you secure it on to be associated with Prada, kind of like an exclusive membership — or, arguably, like shamelessly donning your college merch (head to toe) in the airport. 
Part of the risk with buying the pin is that, in actuality, it’s just a pin. It is very difficult to predict with 100% certainty what goods will increase in monetary value over time, especially since the trend cycle is just beginning to repair itself post-first-lockdown coronavirus and the consequential growth of fast fashion. And, if the pin does open the idea of “endless” luxury goods, will the newfound oversaturation of Prada “items” eventually demote the brand? If enough other luxury labels follow suit, might this trend eliminate the tiers of fashion markets? 
Far from devaluing Prada, I think that the pin is part of Raf Simons’ genius. Not only does this increase word of mouth around the century-old brand through the new generation of social media and the continuous rise of streetwear, but it makes Prada more accessible while maintaining its luxury status. At the same time, the pin demonstrates hype and loyalty in line with Raf’s increased usage of the triangle on accessories and on the runway through boots, gloves and even cuts of garments.
Especially as a financially-conscious material girl and fashion enthusiast, I love what this can mean for the future of luxury, blending of markets (regarding income and brand status) and creative outlets. With this pin aiding the growing legacy and revival of Prada, the savviness of Simon is deservedly applauded. Five stars.

June: A beautiful month for “Stranger Things” inspired summers and rainbows flying left and right. While Pride month is usually known for having wondrous floats and parades, another facet of Pride is, of course, rainbow capitalism. 
Rainbow capitalism is the commodification of Pride and the use of “equality,” “freedom” and “love” as aspects of marketing, rather than actual furthering of the movement.
Nonetheless, some corporations do take this time to donate to LGBTQIA+ causes and join the movement for visibility of queer and trans communities. So, in that spirit of visibility, here are some brands to buy from this June. 
Adidas – 10/10
Adidas’ theme for this year is “Love Unites,” a sentiment backed by its conviction to end homophobia and transphobia in sports. This year, this company collaborated with the organization Athlete Ally to do just that. The street style collection takes rainbow to a whole new level with graffiti-inspired artwork that makes each piece unique. From sweaters to shorts and sweats to socks, the collection is both uniform and subtly different as you move through each piece, making it that much more special to see. 
Some notable pieces also have the words “Love Unites” in the graffiti style, which prevents them from being tacky and makes them blend well with the rest of the collection. A favorite piece for me has to be the ’70s-inspired graffiti black bucket hat that stays true to the theme of the collection and is easy to pair with any outfit.
Converse – 8/10
A mix of subtle and outright fabulous is what’s in store from Converse’s “Pride By You” collection. Pledging over $1.6 million to LGBTQIA+ causes like BAGLY and Las Fotos Project since 2015, you can shop Pride at Converse in good conscience. Collaborating with a number of LGBTQIA+ artists, the company has released a number of shoes and various other accessories that scream Pride. 
Some notable mentions are the trans flag and Pride flag shoes that are shaped in a sun, which have just enough color to be tasteful without being overwhelming. On the other hand, there are some more decorative Pride shoes one can choose from, like the rainbow platforms or the fully covered rainbow Converse shoes. While these may not be everyone’s cup of tea, there are definitely other options to choose from if that is the case, and the brand certainly has something for everyone. 
Disney – 7/10
Disney has fallen short in the past, with some questionable Pride collections to say the least, but this year there seems to be some slight improvement in the brand with its Disney Pride collection. Donating 100% of the profits earned off of all Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and Disney characters within the collection to organizations like The Trevor Project, this is another collection that will ensure your money is going toward a good cause. 
There are adorable button ups within the collection with the Pride flag and shirts with Disney characters in rainbow colors, but you can’t expect Disney to be subtle. The collection may not be the most practical or wearable, but the Minnie Mouse Disney ears with a rainbow bow, along with other collectibles, are perfect for a Disneyland outing. 
Vans – 10/10
A hint of Pride goes a long way, and that’s what you get with Vans’ “Together as Ourselves” collection this year. This is yet another brand to invest in if you’re looking for some colorful accessories. You can also tell that this collection was created by LGBTQIA+ artists since the collection is so beautifully articulate and serene. 
A notable shoe is the white slip-on with kisses on it that make up the lesbian flag, a community often less visible than others. Their splash of Pride in their very artsy collection makes this one of the most notable collections of the bunch. Kohl’s is promoting Vans goods, along with other Pride collections, in their stores. 
Target – 7/10
What would this list be without the infamous Target collection? Collaborating with various artists and working with antiracist and LGBTQIA+ affirming organization GLSEN, this collection does a good job of bringing Pride to everyone. 
Previously, Target has been ridiculed for having subpar collections, but this year’s “Take Pride” is different. With body-affirming lines by TomboyX and Humankind, the collection prides itself on usability in everyday life. 
Pride is a time of celebration, and what better way to do so than through fashion? Buying from brands that are counteracting rainbow capitalism is the key to a successful Pride, and these are just a few of many companies donating to good causes.

You might be well aware by now that my column talks about the South and its politics, but I don’t cover the South because it’s necessarily a fun thing to do. Sometimes, the news cycle south of the Mason-Dixon line is slower than molasses. Recently, it’s been more upsetting. I talk about the South because there’s never been a better time, especially as midterm elections approach, to heed W.E.B. DuBois’ timeless quote: “As the South goes, so goes the nation.”
Biased as I am, being a Southerner and a Georgian, I think the South can be viewed as a great example of a political crystal ball. It’s the birthplace of the civil rights movement and a handful of labor movements, and in 2020, Southern states made all the difference in a consequential election year. South Carolina helped turn around a Biden campaign that seemed to be sputtering out fast, and I’d argue that Georgia wasn’t on anybody’s mind before the Peach State sent two Democrats to the Senate and flipped blue for the first time since 1992.
It is yet again in Georgia where Trump’s clout and the ever-coveted endorsement of the former President are being put to the test. This time around, I believe the election results that come out of the Peach State might be the biggest indicator of whether or not the South, and the nation as a whole, is ready to move on from Donald and his associates.
2022 is the year because, unlike in 2020, the leading Republican candidates running for the positions that make all the difference — such as Secretary of State and the Governor’s Office — are the ones that defied Trump and refused to breathe life into the “Big Lie” that the 2020 elections were stolen. For example, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, an incumbent who is running for reelection to the same position, beat Congressman Jody Hice (R-GA) with nearly 52.3%, compared to Rep. Hice’s 33.4%. 
Raffensperger made headlines for doing the bare minimum in protecting democracy by refusing the former president’s demand to “find” more votes to put him over Biden in 2020. Hice, on the other hand, objected to the certification of the results of the 2020 election in Congress on January 6, which is probably what gave him Trump’s golden seal of approval in the Secretary of State race.
Trump’s pick for Georgia governor, former Georgia Sen. David Perdue, didn’t fare too well either. The governor’s race is the second time Perdue has run for office with the endorsement of the former president — the first time being in 2020 when he was running for reelection in the Senate — a race that he notably lost. That time, he ran unopposed in the Republican primary, and ultimately ran against a fairly moderate Democrat, Jon Ossoff. This year, Trump’s endorsement couldn’t even muster him past the primary — which incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp won.
Trump built his whole brand on the premise of slapping his last name onto hotels and real estate. That only got him so far in the business world, and it’s obvious by the defeat of his endorsed candidates that the Trump name is starting to lose its shine in the political world too. 
What Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Raffensperger have managed to do is push the same sort of nonsense that Trump might espouse, but without sounding like the former president, much less invoking his name in their ads, talking points or debates. This just goes to show that you can’t run on the Big Lie and expect to win anymore. Conservative voters understand that there’s a great range of issues that need to be addressed — issues that perpetrators of the Big Lie don’t seem to talk much about. If Georgia voters, who, according to my memory, are willing to put up with a lot, are already getting tired of Trump, imagine what the rest of the nation is feeling.
This might sound like good news for liberals and progressives hoping that Republican infighting may help their chances of winning state elections, but don’t fold up this paper just yet. Nobody reading this should take Rep. Hice and Sen. Perdue’s defeat as the end of the effects that Trumpism has had on the country. 
Republican infighting and the waning power of Trump’s endorsement won’t really trip up Republicans during election time if Democrats stick with their election game plan, which honestly seems to be running on the “Trump is Bad” wagon until the wheels start to come off. Democrats ought to take Georgia’s state election as a lesson to, as their winning Republican counterparts did, ditch their endless mentioning of the former president so the state, and the nation, can move forward.

Dear diary, I never thought I’d say this, but I am tired of feminism. 
Don’t get me wrong, I would still love to off the patriarchy and abolish the systemic inequalities that women face on the daily. But I will burn myself at the stake if I have to hear “Run The World (Girls)” one more time.
The hyper-positivity of mainstream feminism has had people in the streets chanting “Pussy is power!” or emblazoning “#girlboss” on baby pink mugs. But just below the surface — bubbling in a black cauldron, laced with spilled mascara and Lexapro — burgeons a new iteration of feminism that more and more women are beginning to identify with, a growing voice in pop culture: dissociative feminism.
Coined by Emmeline Clein in 2019, dissociative feminism describes a subset of feminism characterized by jadedness and “interiorizing our existential aches and angst, smirking knowingly at them.” Dissociative feminism describes women who, once exuberant soldiers of the gender equality movement, are now exhausted past the point of anger. Feminist author Leslie Jamison identifies the root of dissociative feminism as “aching gone implicit,” reflecting a reaction to the recent plateauing of women’s rights reforms.
In the latter half of the 20th century, women joined the workforce in droves, began to surpass men in earning college degrees and saw the expansion of their reproductive freedoms. However, that progress has since slowed with the stagnation of women’s employment and many women still struggling to break into the many male-dominated fields. Dissociative feminism reflects women’s sense of apathy to the stalling of the gender revolution with the persistence of the wage gap, discrimination in workplaces and, most recently, the vulnerability of reproductive rights.
Continuing an era of gender reform has proved to be awfully difficult and exhausting. We live in increasingly horrifying times when our leaders can’t even band together to stop school shootings, let alone achieve equality. In the race toward gender equality, the finish line seems like a mirage, taunting us with the fantasy of something we’ll never reach. To be a dissociated feminist is to have a seat in the sand and make a sarcastic remark about having to trek through the desert in the first place.
On the individual level, what makes dissociative feminism so alluring is the dissociative aspect of it, which compels women to step outside of their pain to comment on it — to be indifferent about or even relish in it. In the 2019 series “Fleabag,” the titular protagonist constantly leaves her body in the middle of scenes to cheekily comment on her disastrous life as it is happening. Fleabag’s stark awareness and detachment from her actions and their consequences reflect the core of dissociative feminism, albeit, in a more extreme manner.
Dissociative feminism resonates with many women because it describes women’s exhaustion at the stagnant gender revolution and the catharsis of feminine misery. But there is dangerous potential for the fatalistic aspects of the movement to stall the larger fight for equality.
The way dissociative feminism is portrayed in shows and books may seem relatable to many women, but it really isn’t. As writer from “Another Gaze” Rebecca Liu describes, the archetypical dissociative feminist is “pretty, white, cisgender, and tortured enough to be interesting but not enough to be repulsive. Often described as relatable, she is, in actuality, not.” Self-destruction, jadedness and a nicotine addiction are easily romanticized when portrayed in a white, conventionally attractive, upper-middle class woman. To become disillusioned with mainstream feminism is a luxury those who have no other choice aren’t afforded.
Intersectional feminist writer Ione Gamble wrote, “dissociative feminism is interesting to talk about and gives people language to understand things maybe. But what would the next step be?” The value of dissociative feminism stops at reflecting women’s disillusionment or escapism, as characters like Fleabag live in relatively consequence-less realities. But what then? 
Phoebe Waller-Bridge won’t single-handedly ensure that working class women have enough to feed their families or that Black and Indigenous women and women of color are free of racialized violence. The bleakness and nihilistic tendencies of dissociative feminism push somewhere between “unproductive and genuinely dangerous,” wrote Clein. While internalizing and joking about one’s pain may be a good way to numb it, it does absolutely nothing to fix it. Dissociative feminism is really only feminism in name. As such, we must look elsewhere for the next wave of the gender equality movement.
This in no way means I won’t be rewatching both seasons of “Fleabag,” smiling knowingly every time Fleabag looks toward the camera. Dissociative feminism pinpoints a moment in feminist history when we’re all, yes, still angry about the patriarchy, but also exhausted from fighting it. But that doesn’t mean we should stop. We can all still enjoy a dramatic cry in between advocating for material change and liberating the marginalized of us — just as long as I never hear “Run The World (Girls)” ever again.
