The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety incident report summary between Sunday, April 27 and Monday, April 28. 
Crimes against a person
At 1:47 A.M. on April 27, DPS officers observed a non-USC male appear to lose consciousness after getting punched by another non-USC male during an altercation outside Jack in the Box. The second male then kneed and kicked the male in the head. Officers detained the second male, and he was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
At 2:42 A.M. on April 27, a student responded to the apartment of a friend in Tuscany Apartments and per her request, asked four guests to leave her residence. The guests complied but as they were leaving one of them punched the student in the face, causing him to hit his head on a wall and lose consciousness. A second guest kicked him in the stomach. The guests left the building and could not be located by DPS officers.
At 3:19 P.M. on April 27, a student reported receiving multiple threatening text messages from her ex-boyfriend. She also stated that he started a fire outside her apartment on Ellendale Place, which she and her roommate extinguished with water. The ex-boyfriend was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Crimes against property
at 1:26 A.m. on April 28, DPS officers detained a suspect who had reportedly collided with a Metro train in his vehicle and fled from the scene. The officers turned him over LAPD officers who conducted a field sobriety test. The suspect failed the test and was subsequently arrested.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 7:56 a.m. on April 27, a student reported that while she was reading in a University Gateway Apartments study room, three suspects forced their way in and one brandished a handgun. The student asked the suspects not to harm her and the suspects laughed, and took a picture of the student and left the location. The student did not report the incident at the time it occurred so DPS officers were unable to conduct a search for the suspects.
at 4:41 P.m. on April 27, DPS officers responded to a non-USC female who was struck by a Metro train near Exposition Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. The woman was transported to California Hospital for medical treatment.
at 4:46 P.m. on April 27, a student reported that she saw a suspect masturbating when he walked past her as she and another student were entering their apartment at 1245 Adams Blvd. DPS officers were unable to locate the suspect.

Tuesday night, the Shoah Foundation Institute Student Association hosted “Women of the Holocaust, Cambodia, and Rwanda: Three Survivors in Conversation,” a panel featuring three women who had survived genocide in different parts of the world during the 20th century.

This event concludes USC’s Genocide Awareness Month, which strives to bring events to the community to recollect and raise awareness about genocide, mass atrocities and preventative action that can be taken.
The panel was moderated by USC Shoah Foundation Executive Director Stephen D. Smith, who also holds the Inaugural UNESCO Chair in genocide education. He is also the founder of the UK Holocaust center.
The panelists included Holocaust survivor Celina Biniaz, who is the youngest female Jewish factory worker protected by Oskar Schindler. She began speaking of her experiences in the Holocaust following Steven Spielberg’s film Schindler’s List. Biniaz referred to Spielberg as her “second Schindler” for providing her with freedom to share her story.
Also on the panel was Sara Pol-Lim, who is a survivor of Khmer Rouge’s killing fields, a genocide in Cambodia enacted by the Communist regime estimated to have had one to eight million casualties. Pol-Lim lost her father, three brothers, and many other close relatives.
The third panelist was Rwandan Genocide survivor Edith Umugiraneza, who is the youngest in a family of seven children and lost most of her family during the genocide, including her mother and some of her siblings.
The panel spoke of what remembrance meant to them as genocide survivors.
“I’m 82 years old, so I think it’s very important for me to let other people know, particularly young people, that it’s important to fight bigotry, to accept people for what they are, and value each human being,” Biniaz said. “Hatred is extremely corrosive, only to the person who hates and not so much to those they’re hating because they don’t feel it.”
Pol-Lim stressed that immersing herself with others in her similar situation was what helped her recover from her past.
“I have the opportunity to share with the entire Long Beach Cambodian community, and we came together to inspire hope and in the process heal ourselves,” Pol-Lim said. “For us, there’s no closure. The only closure we have for ourselves is that forgiveness. We have to find that; for me, it’s working in the community. The best way in healing yourself is to help others. It gives me a hope and incentive to appreciate my family.”
Umugiraneza agreed with Pol-Lim, as both women are strong proponents in their communities for remembering and learning from their respective genocides.
“For me, remembrance means prevention, because if we don’t remember we don’t prevent; people will not know what happened,” Umugiraneza said. “It’s educating that will help me honor my people. For me if I stand up and talk about what happened it’s my own way to honor my people.”
The panel also focused on how during genocide, women became more frequent targets of sexual abuse. Umugiraneza remembers her mother telling her to leave their home because as a young girl, she was more vulnerable to being attacked. Biniaz agreed, saying that in Poland most female children didn’t survive, and she was liberated only because of Schindler needing children with small hands.
The women also agreed that they were where they were today due to having a strong mother. The hope that helped them escape their confines came from the wise words of their mothers. Biniaz in particular recalled her mother’s most frequent words.
“The world owes you nothing,” she said. “You take what is given to you and move forward.”
Pol-Lim said her mother instilled the courage into her that led her to fight against oppression rather than give in. She recounted a story where she and her mother were in a line to be executed. All the women were crying and one who stood next to Pol-Lim’s mother asked why the pair wasn’t crying.
“It’s okay — at least I know my whole family will be together,” Pol-Lim’s mother said.
As Pol-Lim heard that, the line was broken and she and her mother were spared from being shot.
Lastly, all three women stressed the importance of forgiving.
“You cannot move forward unless you educate people so that it doesn’t happen again, Biniaz said. “But if you can’t find a peace within yourself, which is forgiveness, then you’re always stuck in a trap because you’re always going to feel resentful.”

Judy Johnson, an adjunct professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, was appointed this past week as the chief marketing and communications officer for Caruso Affiliated, a  Los Angeles-based company that is one of the largest privately held real estate companies in the United States.
Johnson brings a wide range of industry experience to her new appointment. She previously served as president of operations west of Chicago of GolinHarris, a communications firm with an office in Los Angeles.
“A 30-year veteran of the communications and marketing industry, Johnson was honored as PR Professional of the Year by the Public Relations Society of America Los Angeles Chapter in 2012,” said a press release from Caruso Affiliated.
A California native, Johnson received her bachelor’s of arts degree in communications from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she wrote for the Daily Bruin newspaper and was also involved in the school’s radio station.
“Although I’m a Bruin by education, I’m a Trojan by heart,” she said.
Since 2012, Johnson has been an adjunct professor at the Annenberg school, where she teaches a master’s-level course in case studies. Johnson stressed the importance of teaching skills applicable to the professional world.
“What I try to provide to students is really a couple of things,” Johnson said. “Number one is real-world examples of how companies and brands are changing their tactics to try to resonate with consumers in a way that is appropriate for those particular audiences. I also try to introduce them to very    high-level professionals, so they get real-world career advice and access to influencers.”
Johnson noted that when she began her career in marketing, Los Angeles did not have many opportunities for communications and marketing careers.
“I think that Los Angeles is an anomaly,” she said. “For such a large city, it is a difficult communications agency environment. Many of the international and national firms are very small in Los Angeles.”
In recent years, however, the industry has evolved to encompass a wider variety of roles, including specializations in social media and other forms of digital content. Johnson stated that the Annenberg School has been capable of keeping up with new media as it continues to evolve.
“Annenberg is always committed to evolving to educate students for the here and now,” she said. “I can tell you that some other nearby universities do not have the ability to change and adapt as quickly.”
Johnson herself has also been adaptive in her different roles. In her previous work, she has developed brands for companies such as Amazon, Cold Stone Creamery and Disney among others. Her position at Caruso Affiliated, however, involves development and real estate. Caruso Affiliated “is best known for its first-class retail, dining and entertainment centers, such as The Grove and The Americana at Brand in Southern California,” according to the company’s press release, and was founded by USC alumnus and benefactor Rick J. Caruso.
She noted that her work at Caruso Affiliated is not much different from her past experiences in marketing.
“I look at it this way: Every company is a brand, and a brand is an amalgamation of all the experiences, of all the touchpoints,” she said. “Whether I was working for Toyota or Farmer John or Nestlé, it was to build engagement and build rich, positive experiences at the touchpoints that we were responsible for.”
Johnson views her forthcoming work, which ranges from the redevelopment of downtown Pacific Palisades, Calif. to the planning of a five-star resort in Montecito as well as new luxury apartments in Los Angeles, with excitement.
“We are in the real estate, retail and development business,” Johnson said. “Through innovation and continued hard work, we will hopefully get things to the next level as we expand our footprint here in Southern California and beyond.”

On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released a new set of guidelines detailing the responsibilities of colleges and universities to address the issue of sexual assault on college campuses.
The report coincided with the White House’s launch of NotAlone.gov, a website dedicated to providing straightforward information about and support for survivors of sexual assault on college campuses.
The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault also released its recommendations Tuesday concerning steps colleges and universities can take to address the issue.
“We know the majority of rapes are committed by a small number of perpetrators, and we know that both schools and law enforcement struggle to investigate and adjudicate these crimes,” Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole said in a press conference.
Included in the task force reports were proposals that schools conduct “climate surveys” to evaluate the prevalence of sexual assaults on campus and test students’ awareness about the issue. The report also requests that colleges promote bystander intervention.
The task force plans to release a public service announcement to help encourage men to advocate sexual assault prevention. According to the report, the PSA will feature President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and celebrity actors.
Francesca Bessey, a junior majoring in international relations and a rape survivor, said the surveys could be helpful in debunking misconceptions of the prevalence of sexual assault on campuses, but government PSAs might reinforce stereotypes and make light of the issue.
“I think that the surveys will be a helpful reality check for college and university administration that has been telling concerned students that this is not as big of a deal as it actually is,” Bessey said. “[But] a helpful government PSA — I’ll believe it when I see it.”
Still, Bessey said the amount of national attention directed toward the issue of sexual assault in recent years has increased the legitimacy of student advocacy efforts on campuses and that the task force recommendations are a step in the right direction.
“The nature of the recommendations surprised me in a good way and seemed to have responded largely to the grievances that have been being raised by sexual assault [awareness] activists on campuses,” Bessey said.
Last May, USC gained national attention when 16 students and alumni submitted a Title IX complaint to the Office for Civil Rights regarding the university’s treatment of sexual assault victims and errors in its reporting and adjudication process.
In September 2013, the university hired a Title IX investigator with the primary responsibility of investigating cases of sexual assault and following up with survivors throughout the reporting process. That same month, the USC Department of Public Safety released its Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report. The report made adjustments for forcible sex offenses, not noted in the previous year’s report.
The changes were made as part of the university’s effort to increase compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, which requires college campuses to document three calendar years of campus crime statistics.
In March, Ainsley Carry, vice provost for Student Affairs, released a statement about the university’s efforts to work with student organizations to increase awareness of sexual assault and provide resources for victims.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Carry said the university is continually reviewing existing policies and he and his colleagues are in the process of reviewing the task force report.
“We will review these documents and analyze our policies and practices accordingly … and we will use this opportunity to emphasize our support of students’ rights under Title IX,” Carry wrote in an email.
Kaya Masler, executive co-director of the USC Women’s Assembly and a member of the Safer Campus Initiative, a group within the Women’s Assembly, said she knows individuals who contributed to the task force report and she is pleased with the recommendations but hopes that additional details will be provided about possible sanctions for perpetrators of sexual assault.
Masler has worked with administrators to improve the reporting and adjudication process, but administrators often rely on student organizations to focus on peer prevention and awareness and bystander education
“Although we do our best, we are also full time students without the ability to ensure that other students attend our events,” Masler said. “This leaves the majority of the student population undereducated about consent, and that’s really dangerous.”
Bessey maintains the White House’s efforts are a step in the right direction, but it is difficult to determine whether or not they can be successfully implemented on campus and lead to effective reform.
“Right now these recommendations are fantastic but they don’t have any teeth without laws behind them,” Bessey said. “Furthermore, without means of enforcing those laws, even the current laws that we have that deal with these issues — the most significant being Title IX and the Clery Act — we can see on our own campus how slow that process comes about and how much schools don’t seem to necessarily fear retribution from these issues,” Bessey said.

When Daily Trojan Editorial Director Yasmeen Serhan pitched a story about President Barack Obama decrying the racist statements made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling earlier this week, I was reluctant to pick it up. Everyone and their mom (including mine) had an opinion about Donald Sterling’s racist comments at that point, so I felt no need to add to the discussion, and I said that I would sooner eat glass than argue the importance of free speech and right to privacy in Sterling’s case.
Sterling was fined $2.5 million and banned for life from the league by NBA commissioner Adam Silver in a press conference Tuesday afternoon. This precludes Sterling from attending any NBA games, meeting with any member of an NBA organization and all league-related activities — but it does not remove him as owner of the team. NBA owners would have to vote in a three-fourths majority to force the Clippers owner to sell the team and — all of a sudden — the right to freedom of speech and an expectation to privacy becomes a salient consideration. So, someone, bring me an empty champagne bottle, a fork and some salt and pepper.
Before we proceed, let’s clear a few things up: Sterling has not acted like an NAACP Lifetime Achievement Award recipient (which, despite being denied the award this year, he already received from the Los Angeles chapter of the organization in 2009). Even prior to the release of his recent statements, in 2003, Sterling had been sued by the federal government for discriminatory housing practices. The lawsuit alleged that Sterling had said black tenants “smell and attract vermin,” among other reprehensibly racist things.
Make no mistake about it: Donald Sterling’s attitude has no place in the United States — much less the culturally diverse community of Los Angeles. His statements and his actions were repugnant and completely out of line. But this is the United States of America, land of the free, home of the “say whatever you want as long as you pay me.” And Sterling did: He said the worst possible thing he could say for someone in his position at the worst possible time, and he’s going to pay something to the tune of $2.5 million on top of lost sponsorships and potential revenues if he’s forced to sell.
But — and here we go — Sterling was expecting the conversation to be private. No doubt Sterling’s track record (see: his alleged treatment of former Clippers GM and NBA great Elgin Baylor, the federal housing discrimination lawsuit) points to the actions of an indisputably racist man. But the defense of his view which, according to the extended version of the tape, as being “part of a culture” falls in line with his responses. Sterling’s words were those of an embattled old man, whose paradoxical view of race relations seems to only make sense to the person who holds them. Sterling clearly had tension between his public persona and his private beliefs — and the fact that his private conversation made front page news as a direct result of what he said is disturbing.
What’s interesting about this entire investigation is that the woman in the audio recording didn’t seem to even try to understand what Sterling was saying — instead, she seemed to be goading Sterling into admitting or saying something racially insensitive. According to TMZ (it’s fine, you can go back to reading those three words as a disclaimer now), a friend of the woman in the recording said Sterling knew he was being recorded, and that the woman in the recording refused to sign a confidentiality agreement regarding the contents of the tapes.
The question that remains, however, is why didn’t the woman sign the confidentiality agreement if the intention was to only archive what Sterling said and play it back to him in case he forgot? At whose suggestion did Sterling begin to allow his statements to be recorded? I don’t mean to defend Sterling’s actions here, but clearly Sterling trusted the woman to some extent in order to have his words recorded. That’s why there seems to be an element of opportunism on the part of the woman here, and for these statements to hit the airwaves when the woman in the recording is currently being hit with an embezzlement lawsuit from the Sterling family seems far too timely to be coincidental. For the record, the attorney representing the woman in the recording denied it was his client who released the tape to TMZ.
With the family lawsuit, the leaked tapes and Sterling’s strained marriage, trying to gauge the motivations behind each action, not to mention the mystery behind who exactly released the tapes, only leads to more questions and its own thicket of drama and intrigue.
Regardless, all of these considerations still do nothing to mitigate the actual result: Sterling’s (rather bewildering) private beliefs were made public. So what now? The owners have a huge decision to make. If enough owners don’t vote to force Sterling to sell, it can have disastrous implications on league-wide morale. And yet the same owners have to be wary of what private statements they make can be released to the public, and whether they, too, would be subject to losing out on future revenues as a result of being forced out.
My view on the matter is simple: this was a uniquely egregious case of racism that, in all likelihood, will never be repeated. Unless these owners hold similarly unconscionable beliefs and have a 30-something mistress recording their statements because of their senility (I’m not ruling it out, either), they should jointly vote to force Sterling to sell the Clippers as a show of both solidarity and respect to the black community.

There’s a growing abuse of personal freedoms in this country, folks, and it’s not just from the federal governemnt. More recently, the CEO of Mozilla was forced out because of his personal views, now the NBA is working to force out Sterling, again, because of his personal views. The LA City Council is working towards asking/forcing the LATimes and other pubs to cancel all Sterling Properties related advertisements. 
I don’t like where our society is heading. We’ve seen this before and it didn’t start on a good note.  The USSC has given the federal gov the ability to search all media and communications for what is being called “hate speech” and troublemakers. What does that mean? Who determines what is hateful and who is a troublemaker?  Im very concerned about the future of our great country. We’re not in Kansas anymore Dorothy.

The No. 1-ranked USC sand volleyball team will put its 21-match winning streak to the test this weekend at the 2014 American Volleyball Coaches Association Collegiate Sand Volleyball National Championships in Gulf Shores, Ala. The event will start on Friday with preliminary action, followed by team and pair championships on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
Killin’ it · Sophomore Alexa Strange, a transfer from Nebraska, has won 31 of her 36 matches this year while paired with freshman Kelly Claes. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (22-1) increased their school-record winning streak with a pair of 5-0 sweeps over Arizona and Boise State last Saturday. Neither the Wildcats (7-12) nor the Broncos (4-7) advanced to the AVCA tournament.
USC has now tallied five consecutive sweeps, and has dropped a pairs match only six times this season. The team’s one defeat came at the hands of No. 2 Pepperdine, a perennial powerhouse that was the nation’s top team at the time. The Waves (15-1) enter the AVCA tournament as the second seed. Seeded third is No. 3 Florida State, a team that the Women of Troy edged out by a 3-2 margin in March. No. 4 Hawai’i, No. 5 Florida International and No. 6 Stetson also qualified for the event. USC, which along with Pepperdine earned a first-round bye, will open up play against the winner of a first-round match between the Rainbow Warriors (18-3) and the Panthers (14-2).
Though the Women of Troy are a young team, they have shown depth and maturity beyond their years in 2014. Even on court five, the freshman pair of Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler has been an intimidating force. The duo has an overall record of 21-5, but has been especially dangerous in dual matches, where they are 20-1. Martin and Wheeler’s win over Samantha Cash and Taylor Racich of Pepperdine in late March helped seal USC’s rematch win over then-No. 1 Pepperdine. It will take this type of team effort to secure the Women of Troy’s first team national title.
A pairs’ championship will also be up for grabs this weekend, and USC should be competitive in that arena as well. Senior Kirby Burnham and freshman sensation Sarah Hughes have had an amazing season together, winning 36 of their 39 matches. Freshman Kelly Claes and sophomore Alexa Strange have also been nearly unstoppable, going 31-5. Interestingly, one of the duo’s losses came at the Pac-12 Pairs Invitational against Burnham and Hughes. Still, the road to a national title will not be easy for either pair. Both have lost to duos from potential opponents Florida State, Hawai’i or Pepperdine.
Last year, in only the program’s second season in existence, Burnham teamed with Stevi Robinson to produce a 25-4 overall record. The tandem won their last eight matches including four at the AVCA Championships on May 5 of last year to claim USC’s first-ever pairs championship in sand volleyball. They were each later named the first-ever sand volleyball All-Americans in USC history. Burnham, Hughes and the rest of the team will attempt to repeat history this weekend in Alabama.
The Women of Troy have a very unique group of players and coaches, including three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Misty May-Treanor. May-Treanor has been a guiding force at USC since leaving her alma mater Long Beach State to join head coach Anna Collier, one of her mentors, in Los Angeles. All three of the team’s coaches have experience at the professional level.
The Women of Troy should be well prepared as the head into the year’s final tournament, but must stay focused and disciplined during this next week. Though the team is undefeated both at home and neutral sites, it cannot take any of the tournament’s matches lightly. Revenge-minded Pepperdine will surely remember its 5-0 defeat of USC early in the season, while No. 3 Florida State will have local fan support.
The Women of Troy will begin their title chase this Friday at 12 a.m. against the winner of Hawai’i and Florida International. Matches will be broadcast on tape delay on CBS Sports starting Monday, May 26.

USC’s women’s lacrosse team is accustomed to making history.
Last season, the team introduced the sport to USC, and went 8-10 in its inaugural season, including a 5-3 mark in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play.
Leading the charge · Sophomore attacker Caroline de Lyra added three goals to her season total in USC’s last regular season game against Marquette. De Lyra is third on the team with 25 goals this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Just last weekend, the team played the first-ever lacrosse game at the famous Wrigley Field, home to the Chicago Cubs.
This week, the Women of Troy (9-8, 6-3) will attempt to achieve another first by advancing into the finals of the MPSF Tournament.
On Thursday, fifth-seeded USC will face fourth-seeded Oregon in the quarterfinals of the MPSF Tournament in Denver.
The Women of Troy come into the matchup having just rounded out their regular season on a Midwest road trip, traveling first to Chicago to take on No. 5 Northwestern, and then to Milwaukee, Wisc., where they faced Marquette.
Against Northwestern, the alma mater of USC head coach Lindsey Munday, USC hung tough in the first half, but couldn’t keep up in the second, and eventually fell 12-7 to the Wildcats.
The Women of Troy got back on track with a win against the Marquette Eagles behind a six-goal effort from sophomore attacker Caroline de Lyra. De Lyra also picked up three assists as USC pulled off an 11-5 victory to end the regular season.
Munday says the road trip was a great way for the team to shape up for the conference tournament.
“I think this last weekend was perfect for us,” Munday said. “We had a great opponent in Northwestern and a huge venue at Wrigley Field. There were 5,000 people there, which generally doesn’t happen for lacrosse home games. It was a big pressure situation, and I think we had some nerves with it, but I’m excited that we got it out against Northwestern, so that in the conference tournament — another big event — we’ll have that experience.”
The team now sets its sights on the Ducks (10-7, 6-3), who are looking to bounce back from two consecutive losses to finish their regular season. Last Friday, Oregon fell to Denver, the top team in the MPSF, by an 11-5 score. On Saturday, the Ducks were edged out 10-9 in overtime by Colorado, who tied Oregon and USC for third in the final conference standings.
“We’re excited for the opportunity to play, first and foremost,” Munday said. “We’ve got a great opponent in Oregon who we faced not too long ago. We’re just happy for the opportunity and ready to improve upon the last time.”
Oregon’s Nikki Puszcz leads the team in goals scored, averaging 2.18 per game. Midfielder Carly O’Connell and attacker Shannon Propst each average 1.59 goals per game for the Ducks, and Propst has added a team-high 2.41 assists per game. Goalie Caroline Federighi averages 5.65 saves per game, with a .432 save percentage.
USC will undoubtedly be looking for revenge in Thursday’s matchup, as the Women of Troy fell to the Ducks at home just a week and a half ago on April 18. In the 10-8 loss, 21 turnovers doomed the Women of Troy, and a hat trick from freshman attacker Annie Ruland couldn’t save the day.
“I think it was a fluke that we lost,” said senior midfielder Ceilidh Meagher. “To be honest, they play hard and they never give up. That’s something that is a trait of their team and we have to be ready for that.”
The Women of Troy will bring some momentum into the match, as sophomore defender Courtney Tarleton was just named MPSF Defensive Player of the Week. Tarleton notched eight ground balls again Northwestern and two against Marquette, putting her in second place on the team with 31 ground balls on the season. She also leads the team in caused turnovers, with 19 on the season. The team’s co-captain, who hails from Ridgewood, N.J., became the second-straight USC player to win the award, following sophomore goalie Liz Shaeffer’s award last week.
The winner of Thursday’s quarterfinal battle will advance to face top-seeded host Denver (16-1, 9-0), which will surely be a difficult task. The Pioneers’ Jill Remenapp leads the nation in assists, with 2.71 per game, and goalie Hanna Hook leads the MPSF in goals-against average (7.38) and save percentage (.534).
Despite Denver’s spotless conference record and standout players, the Women of Troy are keeping an optimistic mindset.
“I know that we have so much potential,” Meagher said. “It’s just a matter of putting it all together and playing a little but older than we actually are and just having the maturity to manage our games well and just understand that there’s a lot on the line.”
In addition to the team’s potential, USC has reason to be optimistic because when the team faced off against Denver earlier this season, the Pioneers barely eked out an 8-7 victory. USC held a lead at two points during the game, but two goals apiece by Moore and freshman attacker Michaela Michael weren’t quite enough to pull off the upset.
The Pioneers have escaped with one-goal victories five times this season, and the Women of Troy might be poised to finally hand the team its second loss of the season.
But first, USC has to focus on Oregon.
“In your conference tournament, it’s survive in advance,” Munday said. “So if you don’t win on Thursday, then you’re not playing Denver — you’re not playing on Friday. So I think our girls are very aware of that. We’re not looking past Oregon, they’re a great team, we lost to them the first time out, so we have to be focused on that.”
The Women of Troy take on the Ducks Thursday, May 1 at Denver’s Peter Barton Stadium at 7 p.m. MST.

Vicky Kasar might have been late to the game learning about the popular photoblog “Humans of New York,” but she has certainly made up for lost time.
Kasar discovered the blog last December. By January, she had made a slightly more local version: Humans of USC.
“I thought it’d be really fun and a great way to get in touch with people I had wanted to talk to and then also meet new people, just kind of put together all these people at ’SC that I found really inspiring,” Kasar said.
Since then, Kasar has made an effort to post a daily photo of someone around USC  accompanied by a quote she got from speaking with them, the same format as “Humans of New York.” Her page now has more than 1,500 Facebook likes.
“You can tell when someone’s willing to talk to you or if they’re going to give you juice, or if they’re just going to be like, ‘mm-hmm,’” Kasar said of her methodology of selecting students to spotlight.
Kasar’s excitement about the project is palpable. She said the motivation behind her decision to start the blog was personal — she wanted to encourage herself to get out of her own patterns and habits.
“There’s so many worlds within USC that don’t really speak to one another … so everyone has such a different experience at this school,” Kasar said. “But I think you can be blind to what others are going through here.”
As well as photographing random people she finds, Kasar also spotlights people at large events. Recently she featured someone protesting outside of Bovard in support of SCALE’s protest, and a speaker at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. She says the most popular posts, however, are the ones with quotes others can identify with.
“Things about beliefs or really exposing the truth about USC, like defying a stereotype or something that can ring true to everyone else, those tend to get a really good reaction,” Kasar said.
A few weeks ago, Kasar had the opportunity to meet Brandon Stanton, creator of the original “Humans of New York,” when he came to campus as part of USC’s first annual Arts Week. During the Q&A portion of the event, she asked Stanton his thoughts on spinoffs of his project, to which he responded positively. Kasar doesn’t exactly model how she runs her page off of Stanton, though.
“I went through the whole, ‘Oh, I’m going to methodically look at the questions Brandon asks and how he does it,’ but I just realized when I went out there and I tried to ask certain questions the conversations I was having were awkward,” she said. “I didn’t like it at all, so I totally just go out there and say whatever comes to mind.”
That’s not the only way she strays from Stanton. Though Stanton also uses a professional camera — one that can run upwards of $5,000 — Kasar takes all the photos on her iPhone. Though this is partly is for practical reasons, Kasar said she also made the conscious choice to use a phone rather than a camera.
“I started out just doing it on my iPhone because I didn’t want it to feel like a big thing, like someone was being formally interviewed because I wanted it to be natural,” she said.
This might not be how it’s done in the future, though. Kasar is graduating in just a few short weeks, leaving Humans of USC in the hands of others. One of these people is Sanford Reed, a sophomore majoring in theatre and critical studies. Reed hopes to improve the quality of pictures on the site.
“‘Humans of New York’ has a lot of very professional-type photos, and I want to use my camera to encompass that because I think the quality of the picture — in the end it’s about the quote, but the quality of the photo represents the quality of Humans of USC.”
Reed is one of six people currently collaborating with Kasar on Humans of USC. Come fall, only four will be left. Though exact positions have yet to be decided on, all four are already planning for next year.
“We’re really just looking to represent all different types of people in the USC community and just kind of make everyone feel more connected with other people,” said Sophia Ipsen, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business). Ipsen said having multiple people take photos will help to diversify the number of people the group can reach. Reed also said he was excited to meet new people through the project.
“I love talking to people because they all have a different story,” he said. “We all come from different places, and we’ve gathered at one place: USC.”
Reed and Ipsen, however, each have their own priorities for the blog moving forward. While Reed wants to concentrate on the photography aspect of it, Ipsen wants to branch out to people around USC who aren’t students.
“I’d really like to see people who you wouldn’t expect to see … other actors at USC who people don’t always think about or see on the surface,” she said. “Kind of expose the more hidden secret gems of USC.”
In the end, however, both credit Kasar with the idea to start the page and the hard work she has put in this semester to make it a reality.
“This is all because of Vicky,” Reed said. “She is the root of this entire project, and I am so excited to be part of it. Vicky and I are very alike in that we look at people, and we don’t just see this other person walking around. Everyone has a different story, a different background.”

Congratulations on enduring the last week of classes, Trojans. I can honestly say that this semester has been one for the books, but it is not over yet because we have two weeks of finals and then comes summer vacation. Since this is my last column of the semester, I want to leave you with three words: Cinco de Mayo.
Cinco de Mayo to college students typically equals Cinco de Drinko, but I would like to caution you to think otherwise this year and make this year Cinco de Eat-o — just eat  every bit of Mexican food in sight — because we are so close to the end, but we do not want to end things early for ourselves, am I right?
There are quite a few fun things happening in Los Angeles this weekend — not to mention, the weather forecast for Los Angeles is super sunny — so I would head to the beach for some beach fun. Honestly, nothing sounds better than some iced tea while laying out on the beach.
My number one place to go to for Cinco de Mayo is Olvera Street. If you’re not an L.A. native, then I recommend that you go at least once while you are a student at USC. Olvera Street is a historical strip of Los Angeles full of street vendors and restaurants. If you know anything about Los Angeles or Mexican-American history, you will know that this is more of a fun tourist attraction, but it is an entertaining place to visit for people of all ages. Olvera Street is known for its Mexican street performers and fun little night life, and on Cinco de Mayo, it’s jam packed with people, so get there early for some fun festivities and possibly free drinks and food.
According to CBS Los Angeles, there has been a series of Cinco de Mayo events that have been happening all week, starting this past weekend with cultural parades in Downtown Los Angeles and across the East Los Angeles region.
I highly recommend getting cultured this weekend. After all, though we might live in a heavily diverse and Latino area, why not celebrate a fun holiday with the best of them?
If you’re planning on staying in for this holiday, I would recommend finding some fun and easy recipes to make to celebrate. Homemade paletas, or popsicles, are a great way to cool off and making some easy and fresh horchata is always the way to go. In the food department, ceviche is always a good call, but cooling off the afternoon with a Dos Equis is even better.
Cheers and keep fighting on, Trojans. The end is closer than it seems and summer tastes so sweet once you know that you do not have any papers or projects to turn in. For all of my seniors out there, I bid thee farewell and I know that you will represent our wonderful university proudly in that big, bad adult world that many of us have yet to face.

The concept of “living local” has come to define Los Angeles in recent years. As more people shift toward buying local food and hand-crafted products, a vast community of “makers” and independent artisans has taken shape. Artisanal LA, a pop-up event held last weekend at the LA Mart, provided an opportunity for small businesses to showcase their products.
Artsy fartsy · Based off of the concept of buying local products and hand-crafted goods, a number of new L.A.- based vendors gathered together for Artisanal LA last weekend. The event featured a variety of vendors ranging from BonBliss, Procakes, Scrub-2-Go and Seasoned! – Maral Taritian | Daily Trojan
Though primarily focused on food, the event hosted a wide range of vendors including gourmet bakers, small-batch chocolatiers and local jewelers. Robert Siegel Studio, a ceramics company offering hand-crafted porcelain items, displayed pieces from its Beaux Collection, which features minimalistic vases and tableware accented with gold.
Designer Tanner Trowbridge, an alumnus of the USC Roski School of Fine Arts, described the inspiration behind the collection.
“Gold is ‘in’ right now,” Trowbridge said. “We have a lot of vibrant colors that we mix with white and gold stripes.”
BonBliss, a skin-care line “inspired by deliciously sweet candy treats,” creates travel-friendly body scrubs in fun scents. The “Body Truffle” is a single-use capsule that simultaneously moisturizes and exfoliates skin. The “Scrub-2-Go,” a miniature version of the Truffle, allows people to feel instantly refreshed while on-the-go.
“The Scrub-2-Go’s are individually wrapped for convenient use throughout the day,” said Elissa Choi, co-founder of BonBliss. “You don’t have to carry perfume and lotions; one step does it all.”
Fancy Boyz reinvents classic baked goods using quality ingredients. The coffee-donut cookie, a signature item, fuses two familiar flavors into one delectable treat. Each bite begins with a shot of espresso, then transforms into an old-fashioned donut.
“We love the magic of baking,” said Chris Dibble, co-founder of Fancy Boyz. “This cookie is like magic happening in your mouth.”
The peanut butter and jelly sandwich cookie elevates the  ubiquitous childhood snack into a crave-worthy dessert. For the filling, Fancy Boyz mills its own peanut butter and sources local balsamic vinegar for the strawberry-balsamic jam.
The cookies themselves possess a luxurious peanut flavor and a soft, crumbly consistency. Despite the recipe’s simplicity, Fancy Boyz’s attention to detail shines through in the final product.
The company Seasoned! delivers flavorful and healthy meals to peoples’ homes. Each meal kit comes in a compostable bowl filled with fresh, never-frozen ingredients. Options include Japanese curry with organic chicken and quinoa with spiced tofu.
“You cook everything in one pot and you don’t have to do any dishes,” said Mia Cho, founder of Seasoned! “It goes from the door to your mouth in about 10 minutes.”
Heather Elery, a fan of the company, appreciates the meals’ convenience and fresh ingredients.
“It’s good for the environment, good for your body and good for your energy level,” Elery said.
ProCakes, a gluten-free, high-protein pancake mix, also focuses on health and practicality. Three pancakes contain 23 grams of protein and no added sugars.
ProCakes founder and fitness enthusiast Caren Magill said the product caters to people watching their weight.
“It’s a great way to enjoy pancakes while getting your protein in,” Magill said.
For some vendors, such as Seasoned! and ProCakes, Artisinal LA was the first time they launched their products to the general public. Others, such as Robert Siegel Studio and Fancy Boyz, returned after receiving positive feedback and sales from last year’s event.
The showroom set-up allowed exhibitors to gain maximum exposure while providing a comfortable browsing environment for attendees. Artisinal LA hopes to produce multiple shows throughout the year, with the ultimate goal of fostering connections between consumers and local makers.

Written and directed by James Gray, The Immigrant might not be in theaters until May 16, but if you were in Professor Leonard Maltin’s Film Symposium class Thursday night, you got to see an advanced screening. Following the sneak preview of the film, the passionate, animated and comedic School of Cinematic Arts alumnus James Gray stopped by for a Q&A session with Maltin’s students.
Gray spoke candidly about a range of topics during the discussion, including stories from the set of his latest film, his preference for shooting on film over digital formats and his distaste for postmodern irony in the arts. The director even had time to squeeze in a couple of impersonations. His near-perfect Jimmy Stewart impression and his hilarious rendition of Marion Cotillard rehearsing in Polish for The Immigrant had everyone chuckling in their seats.
Before the Q&A session, Gray also sat down for a quick interview with the Daily Trojan where he remembered his days as a film student devouring film theory and foreign films.
“I found all of that theory criticism to be incredibly liberating … It’s an old cliché, but knowledge is power,” Gray said.
Originally from Queens, N.Y., Gray chose USC over notable film schools on the East Coast such as Columbia University and New York University.
A double major in film production and critical studies, Gray exhibits an immense knowledge and respect for film. During the interview, Gray spoke fondly about masterpieces such as Federico Fellini’s La Strada and also expressed a passion for opera. In fact, opera, along with his own family history, inspired the story for The Immigrant.
Before discussing his film, Gray took a moment to reflect on his time as a student at SCA where he would raise his hand to every question posed by Professor Drew Casper, immerse himself in Michael Renov’s lectures and marvel at the world of film theory exposed to him by Marsha Kinder. He recalls one instance where he corrected Professor Casper after he mixed up the title of a Martin Scorsese film. After Gray corrected the professor, Casper said, “‘Thank you James,’ but really what he meant was I was a jerk,” Gray said. “I think I drove him crazy in that big class, 190 … I was a know-it-all.”
When asked about the USC network during the interview, Gray disclosed, “Not only do I have it — I see the same group of friends from film school every Saturday for lunch for 20 years.”
Clearly a loyal friend and collaborator, The Immigrant brings Gray and Joaquin Phoenix together as an actor-director duo for the fourth time. Regarding their working relationship, Gray said the two of them have extensive conversations about Phoenix’s characters. They even “meet up on weekends before the next week’s shoot” to discuss and rehearse.
With The Immigrant, Gray sets out to tell a very large story — the pursuit of the American Dream — but he manages to do so in an incredibly intimate manner. The story develops with nuance and is complemented by both beautiful cinematography and a delicate score.
The narrative unfolds as a classical fable and centers around a Polish immigrant named Ewa Cybulska, played by Marion Cotillard, and her sister as they enter the United States via Ellis Island. As the sisters anxiously wait in line at immigration, Ewa is separated from her sister, who’s sent to quarantine. Left completely alone, Ewa falls prey to the charming but corrupt Bruno (Joaquin Phoenix). She latches on to him for survival, but it becomes Bruno who needs someone to latch on to, making the film an exploration of a parasitic relationship.
Somewhat of a purist, Gray and the film’s director of photography Darius Khondji shot The Immigrant on actual film stock — a material rarely used in the industry aside from a couple of filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg. Gray’s research involved looking at paintings and autochromes — color photographs from the early 20th century — resulting in a gorgeous gold tint to the images on screen.
Gray’s passion for shooting on film isn’t the only tradition he honors. After a remark during the interview that his films feel somewhat classical in their approach to storytelling, Gray was quick to respond that he aims for sincerity and stays away from the postmodern trend of approaching characters with a sense of irony.
“If I don’t care about the character, why should you?” he said. That compassion for his characters definitely translates to the screen. In The Immigrant, both Ewa and Bruno are written carefully. They’re complex and don’t fit into any specific trope or archetype.
The Immigrant might be Gray’s first period film, but it marks his fifth feature. And though he expressed that he was particularly lucky in the industry, receiving management and an agent right after graduation, he offered words of wisdom to young filmmakers during the interview.
“If you take the time to put your heart and soul into [your work], you’re going to be successful,” he said.
To hopeful writer-directors like himself, Gray stressed the importance of learning structure and character, but most importantly being personal.
“If you can speak from your voice, you will be successful,” Gray said.
Though some might argue Gray is overly optimistic about the odds of working in a notoriously competitive industry, he also noted that it’s not an easy road to success in Hollywood.
“It takes a long time to master the craft,” Gray said. “The batting average isn’t high but that’s OK — it took Hitchcock about 10 films to get it right.”

In some cities, the high school you attend can determine a lot about your trajectory in life. This was definitely the case in my hometown of Chicago. On Thursday, I was one of the excited Chicagoans who received news that my hometown would be adding another highly ranked high school to its list of selective-enrollment schools. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel said the name of this high school would be Barack Obama College Prep, named after our nation’s current president. Yet the announcement raises concern about how the opportunities for a quality education are distributed within the nation’s third largest public school system.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
I am a product of the Chicago Public Schools selective-enrollment system, a network of schools in which students are required to test into and, once attending, primarily take honors and Advanced Placement classes. Like most of my classmates, my daily commute lasted more than 30 minutes and took me out of the neighborhood I lived in. In my case, I passed a couple of other selective-enrollment high schools on the way to mine. But for some students in the city, they must travel several miles out of their way to reach a top-tier high school.
Once it opens in the fall of 2017, Obama College Prep will be located near the former location of one of the largest housing complexes in the nation — and also about 10 blocks from my alma mater, Walter Payton College Prep. Meanwhile, the Southwest Side of the city will continue to lack a selective-enrollment high school. Currently, there are 10 selective-enrollment high schools in the city and, according to the Chicago Public School website, there are 112,029 students attending public high schools in the city. The city projects that eventually Obama College Prep will accept up to 1,200 students.
The potential location of the high school is problematic, and might contribute to the larger issue of access to quality school systems in Chicago’s urban center.
Chicago is not the first city to want to name a school after the current president. Here in Los Angeles, Barack Obama Global Preparation Academy opened its doors three years ago in South Los Angeles. Though it’s always risky to name a school after a living person, the bigger concern with the announcement is that Barack Obama College Prep’s location will not represent the work the president accomplished in the city. President Obama spent his adult years working as a public servant on the South Side of Chicago, where he eventually got married and began his family. For this reason, the school that will bear his name in the city where he first became known should be on the South Side.
Another reason to reconsider the placement of the new selective-enrollment high school is to ensure that the city’s students are rising to a new level of education. In the same week as his announcement, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that Chicago Public high schools are on track to achieve a graduation rate of 82 percent. According to a study by the University of Chicago, the graduation rate has increased by 25 percent since 2007 and 9 percent since Emanuel took office in 2011. The current graduation rate in CPS, however, rests at 61.2 percent, according to a recent press release by CPS.
The issue of strategically locating high schools in areas of the city that could use a boost from a rigorous, resource-filled school is not one simply confined to Chicago. Schools that are usually referred to as “failing” schools are largely confined to communities and neighborhoods with low income and high unemployment rates. Furthermore, the city voted to close approximately 50 public schools last year, most of them located on the South Side of the city. This became the largest batch of school closings in any U.S. city, according to the Chicago Tribune. I think it’s about time to have a solid selective-enrollment school on the Southwest Side of the city.
Selective-enrollment schools are a necessary system to have in Chicago right now. But the selective-enrollment system should not be exclusive to only certain parts of the city. As the old adage goes, location is everything.
Every student should have the ability to attend a school on their side of town with ease and a little shorter commute than currently possible. This can be achieved if the city’s newest top-tier school would be built on a side of the city without one currently, instead of being concentrated in an area of a city that already has a top-rated school. This reconsideration would truly represent a city government that is focused on educating all of its students to the best of its abilities and creating citizens who can make salient contributions to the rest of the city, nation and world.

On Tuesday, April 15, the Undergraduate Student Government rejected a resolution that would endorse the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act, a current bill in the U.S. Congress. The eight senators who voted against the endorsement expressed their reasons for doing so in both a news article and a letter to the editor, both published in the Daily Trojan. In both cases, the arguments advanced represent a total lack of awareness of the bill’s content and a dangerous assumption that USG should only be concerned with matters in the USC bubble.
CHIA would fix a loophole in the tax code that currently prevents nonprofit student entities from using charitable donations to improve both the affordability and safety of college housing. The reasoning behind the bill is simple: If colleges can use their tax-deductible donations to improve housing, then nonprofit operators should be able to do the same.
This week, more than 100 students from universities across the United States traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby the bill. Most representatives came with the support of their undergraduate student governments. USC’s students did not.
“The main reason I didn’t support it is that the angle with which it was presented contrasts with the bill itself,” Residential Senator Aziz Akbari told the Daily Trojan in an interview following the rejection. “There’s nothing in the actual bill talking about safety.”
If Akbari had read the bill or any of the publicly available summaries of the bill, he would have found that the reason the word “safety” does not appear in the bill is because its intention is much broader. Akbari seemed to agree.
“Safety is a big issue for us, and we support safety, but the worry is that the money from tax breaks would go towards other things,” he said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
As it turns out, those “other things” are some of the most beneficial parts of the bill. Several hundred thousand students live in nonprofit housing, and at most public schools, room and board costs are greater than the cost of tuition, according to a study by the College Board. If CHIA passes, more nonprofit housing could be built and existing nonprofit housing would be improved and maintained, three measures that have nothing to do with safety but everything to do with making attending college more affordable.
In the letter to the editor published April 21, the senators who rejected the bill further explained their decision. Their intention was to rebut accusations of anti-Greek bias levied against them by the bill’s supporters.
“One of the driving reasons behind this bill is the current disparity in [the] tax-exempt status of universities and of National Greek Organizations. Multiple senators voiced their concern that if this disparity disappeared, donations to Greek organizations would increase at the expense of donations to the University that beneﬁt the entire student body,” the senators wrote.
Not a shred of research supports this claim. Currently, national organizations that want to donate to nonprofit housing providers choose not to because the donations are taxable, and the argument that existing donors would stop donating to other things is simply made up. Even worse, it reflects a dangerous sense of entitlement — even if one donor decided it was important to donate to fire sprinkler upgrades or fire escape renovations, it’s difficult to quantify the impact this would have on USC’s 3.5 billion dollar endowment.
It’s also a double standard — last week, the Senate passed a bill that supports gender-neutral housing, a great step for diversity on our campus but one that could unquestionably lead to a decrease in donations based on religious or ethical reasons. If that didn’t matter in the case of supporting gender-neutral housing, it shouldn’t matter in the case of supporting affordable and safe housing.
The conflation between CHIA and exclusive support for the Greek system is shocking and ignores that CHIA would be available to nonprofits other than the Greek system. Baylor University, which doesn’t even have Greek housing, sent students to support the bill with the backing of its administration, according to the school’s paper.
“The bill has been in Congress for two years and has been subject to numerous changes. If the Senate is to support anything, we wish to be sure of its ﬁnal content rather than give a carte blanche endorsement,” the senators continued.
According to GovTrack, a publicly available website that tracks Congressional activity, however, the bill was introduced on April 9, 2013 and hasn’t been amended a single time.
Research prior to the vote was lacking, to say the least. The senators of the Undergraduate Student Government have three months to catch up — because this is a bill that should receive a revote and unanimous support in the fall.

In May, the remaining shops and restaurants at the University Village will finally close their doors as construction begins on the USC Village, the university’s $1-billion project to turn the area University Village now occupies into dining, retail and student housing space. The Daily Trojan interviewed some of the current UV patrons about their shops, histories and future plans.  The interviews have been lightly edited for clarity. Photos by Christine Yoo.


Akm Alam, owner of Quik-Pix Photo & Digital Lab
Daily Trojan: How long have you had this shop?
Akm Alam: Since 1981. I owned the business since 1995, but before that I was working. So I started to work for the corporation before I became the owner of the business.
 
DT: What are your plans after you close?
Alam: I just found a — it’s still tentative now, it’s not sure yet — shop on Vermont and 29th, exactly two blocks from here.
 
DT: Are you planning on operating the same store over there?
Alam: I’m planning to, yes, yes. Not this large a scale, a smaller scale. Until they finish the Village over here. If they give us the chance, I’ll come back here.
 
DT: So you’d like to come back?
Alam: If they give us the chance, you know. They told us, no priority nothing. They don’t know what kind of business at that time they’re going to offer. If they offer something like this, probably. There’s no reason, I’ve been here for so many years, not to give it to me now.
 
DT: Why do you like having your business in the UV?
Alam: I grew up over here, 33 years. I must like it you know, the environment, community, students, faculty, staff, class. You know I’ve been over here for so many years, you can say I grew up, 33 years in the same place, same location. So I have special feelings, love and affection for this place.
 

Amy Hwang, owner of Nahm San Korean B.B.Q.
DT: How long have you been here?
Hwang: I’ve been here 13 years. I don’t know how long this business was here, but I’ve been here 13 years.
 
DT: What are your plans after you close?
Hwang: I think they told me we can come back … The people who got here before 2008, I’ve been here 2001. That’s why I can come back, I’m hoping.
 
DT: What are you going to do in the meantime?
Hwang: I don’t want to stay home. But they say only three years, but I don’t think three years, longer.
 
DT: What do you like about being in the UV?
Hwang: I like it, I really like it, because the students. I think the students are like my kids, yeah, my kids. When I give to them, I get the money from them, but my mind is just about my son and my daughter, give it to the food. I really enjoy for 13 years.
 
DT: Do you have a favorite memory?
Hwang: I just like the students, that’s it. Sometimes the student got the cold, you know, and I find out because they wipe their nose a lot and the red color. And I use hot water machine and put in lemon. I have all the time lemon because when we make the sauce for beef we put the lemon. We have the lemon, hot water and lemon, I give it to them and then after they go to their country, China or something, and they send a letter. Also next year, new student came from China, and they gave me the letter from before in years the guy, they gave me the letter. And then, after vacation and they got back, they gave me the letter … I really enjoy. I really want to come back. I love the students. Sometimes they get here, “Oh I hungry,” and I can’t say no. Just eating, and I give to them no charge and, “You can pay me next time.”
 

Johnny Senkiua, member of the family that owns Thai Trio
DT: How long have you been here?
Senkiua: 15 years. It’s a family restaurant.
 
DT: What do you like about being here?
Senkiua: Well with the school, closer to the school, with students, I think it’s the best place. Better than go outside, you know, far from school. Student as customer is probably the best.
 
DT: How come?
Senkiua: They’re easy, you know. They’re pretty easy, not too much picky. They just like anything, that’s the best thing.
 
DT: What are your plans after you close?
Senkiua: We don’t know yet. We have Trio House, but you know we’re going to move some stuff from here to there and we’re probably going to start from there.
 
DT: You guys own Trio House too?
Senkiua: It’s a family restaurant. So my brother is taking care of that one. We opened this one first, and then since we did well at this place, that’s why we get Trio House.
 

Rosie Mughadam, owner Touch of Class
*Mughadam requested not to be photographed. 
DT: How long have you had this job?
Mughadam: Thirty-nine years. My husband started here, I owned the second one on the other side.
 
DT: What happened to the second one?
Mughadam: It closed.
 
DT: What are your plans after this store closes?
Mughadam: I’m going to try to see if I find something around the neighborhood because the rents around here are too expensive. They jack up the prices since they know that we got to close around here. And, you know, the business around here in the neighborhood is only eight months.
 
DT: How come?
Mughadam: The students. I work more with the students, I get staff from the school, and I have the community but it’s not [enough]. So the reason that we have to leave is because the school decided to close everything and take everything out of here.
If you allow me, I’d like to thank all the students and staff from the school and the neighborhood. I really wish best luck to all the students who are graduating this year that are clients of here.

Alam: If they give us the chance, you know. They told us, no priority nothing. They don’t know what kind of business at that time they’re going to offer. If they offer something like this, probably. There’s no reason, I’ve been here for so many years, not to give it to me now.
 
DT: Why do you like having your business in the UV?
Alam: I grew up over here, 33 years. I must like it you know, the environment, community, students, faculty, staff, class. You know I’ve been over here for so many years, you can say I grew up, 33 years in the same place, same location. So I have special feelings, love and affection for this place.

DT: What do you like about being in the UV?
Hwang: I like it, I really like it, because the students. I think the students are like my kids, yeah, my kids. When I give to them, I get the money from them, but my mind is just about my son and my daughter, give it to the food. I really enjoy for 13 years.
 
DT: Do you have a favorite memory?
Hwang: I just like the students, that’s it. Sometimes the student got the cold, you know, and I find out because they wipe their nose a lot and the red color. And I use hot water machine and put in lemon. I have all the time lemon because when we make the sauce for beef we put the lemon. We have the lemon, hot water and lemon, I give it to them and then after they go to their country, China or something, and they send a letter. Also next year, new student came from China, and they gave me the letter from before in years the guy, they gave me the letter. And then, after vacation and they got back, they gave me the letter … I really enjoy. I really want to come back. I love the students. Sometimes they get here, “Oh I hungry,” and I can’t say no. Just eating, and I give to them no charge and, “You can pay me next time.”

DT: How long have you been here?
Senkiua: 15 years. It’s a family restaurant.
 
DT: What do you like about being here?
Senkiua: Well with the school, closer to the school, with students, I think it’s the best place. Better than go outside, you know, far from school. Student as customer is probably the best.
 
DT: How come?
Senkiua: They’re easy, you know. They’re pretty easy, not too much picky. They just like anything, that’s the best thing.
 
DT: What are your plans after you close?

DT: You guys own Trio House too?
Senkiua: It’s a family restaurant. So my brother is taking care of that one. We opened this one first, and then since we did well at this place, that’s why we get Trio House.
 

Rosie Mughadam, owner Touch of Class
*Mughadam requested not to be photographed. 
DT: How long have you had this job?
Mughadam: Thirty-nine years. My husband started here, I owned the second one on the other side.
 
DT: What happened to the second one?
Mughadam: It closed.
 
DT: What are your plans after this store closes?
Mughadam: I’m going to try to see if I find something around the neighborhood because the rents around here are too expensive. They jack up the prices since they know that we got to close around here. And, you know, the business around here in the neighborhood is only eight months.
 
DT: How come?
Mughadam: The students. I work more with the students, I get staff from the school, and I have the community but it’s not [enough]. So the reason that we have to leave is because the school decided to close everything and take everything out of here.
If you allow me, I’d like to thank all the students and staff from the school and the neighborhood. I really wish best luck to all the students who are graduating this year that are clients of here.
 
Most importantly, these are the people that care about the students.
Awesome article. UV is the best. The shop owners are so positive, the food is great, and the price is right. Don’t forget Sandwich Island and Health Hut.
