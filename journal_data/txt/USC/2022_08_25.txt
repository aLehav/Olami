An activated sprinkler in the Parkside Restaurant flooded the dining hall, spurring a mass evacuation of the cafeteria and the surrounding Parkside residences Wednesday around 7:15 p.m. There was no mass structure fire.
Agent 66 of the Los Angeles Fire Department — who declined to provide his name — said he wasn’t sure what exactly set off the sprinkler. He indicated that it could have been heat or pressure.
“Any time you bump or hit a fire sprinkler, 25 gallons of water comes out every 60 seconds,” said Fire Safety Coordinator Melvin Brown. “The kitchen area is flooded … It’s a mess in there.”
Adam Yonas, a freshman majoring in biochemistry who was eating in the dining hall at the time, said that most students didn’t evacuate even when the alarm went off; it wasn’t until cafeteria staff told students to leave that most did.
“I think it [was] pretty orderly,” said Johnson Gao, a freshman majoring in computer science/business administration. “There’s no push and there’s no shout.” 
A handful of other students expressed disappointment that the fire alarm interrupted the cafeteria’s waffle day.
“This actually happens often,” Brown told a crowd of students. “Any time you hear that fire alarm activation go off, please take it seriously.”

Earlier this month, HBO Max added animated feature film “Driftwood’’ to its growing list of canceled and removed programming, a mere three months after its initial announcement.
“Driftwood” would have been Cartoon Network’s first original animated feature film created for HBO Max. The sci-fi adventure followed Clover, a mouse-like creature searching for a sustainable source of energy and freedom from an evil corporation in the titular lost city of Driftwood. Although it is currently unclear how much of the film was completed before its cancellation, crew members have expressed their mix of disappointment and hope for upcoming projects.
“Working on this was such a treat,” said Finn, a production manager at Cartoon Network, via Twitter (@Dhubetter). “The whole crew is amazing and we all were so excited to share this. Now, I’m just heartbroken that no one will see more than this poster.”
Storyboard artist Mason Alec emphasized the “Driftwood” team’s passion on Twitter.
“What an incredible team to be a part of,” Alec wrote. “‘Driftwood’ was such a game changer in terms of story and style. When everyone on the team loves the project, you know you’re making something truly special. The world deserves this movie, and Victor deserves to make it.”
Victor Courtright, “Driftwood”’s creator, faced another loss when his animated miniseries “Aquaman: King of Atlantis” was removed along with 35 other movies and TV shows mid-August. A shocking 25 out of the 36 removed programs were animated, including popular and critically acclaimed cartoons like “Infinity Train,” “Close Enough” and “Summer Camp Island.”
The removal came as a surprise to fans and showrunners alike. “Infinity Train’s” creator Owen Dennis “had no idea it was coming,” and suggests that the issue lies with the recent corporate merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery.
The two companies completed their merger in April of 2022 to form Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. David Zaslav, the newly merged company’s CEO, expressed a focus on profits for streaming after the cancellation of another HBO Max film, “Batgirl.” Zaslav claimed that WB Discovery higher-ups “looked hard at the direct-to-streaming business” and simply “can’t find an economic value for [‘Batgirl’].” This decision to only back high-budget feature films for theatrical release while scaling back on direct-to-HBO Max films placed an unfortunate target on “Driftwood” in its prompt cancellation.
For such a long-standing and highly anticipated DC property like “Batgirl” to be canceled, anxiety arose among audiences and all eyes were suddenly on HBO Max and other streaming platforms to await their next move. The WB Discovery merger only caused more confusion as people from both companies were potentially moved around, fired or quit. Netflix has also been facing scrutiny for recent cancellations such as “Bone,” the animated series based off of the widely loved comic book, which was canceled in April of 2022 following a major lay-off at Netflix Animated.
Several of HBO Max’s shows still had unreleased seasons, like “Summer Camp Island” and “OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes,” that Cartoon Network has assured fans will premiere on the channel. However, where the episodes will land after their initial premiere is uncertain. 
Another question remains in the minds of many dedicated animation fans: Just why are so many of these cancellations and removals cartoons? According to CNBC, WB Discovery has “three main motivations behind the cuts: slashing costs, moving away from content aimed at kids and families and decluttering the service.”
Removing these properties would save WB Discovery tens of millions of dollars. Also according to CNBC, statements from HBO Max executives suggest that the service believes its children’s content is just not receiving enough viewership. As a result, a majority of content for kids and families will continue to be removed as HBO Max pulls in new programming, mostly reality TV, from its Discovery counterpart.
Although adult animated content exists on HBO Max, the animated medium is largely associated with children’s entertainment, and a quick browse through the list of removed programming reveals that a majority of the cartoons are rated for teen-and-under audiences. The statistics regarding low viewership for these properties that HBO Max refers to are currently unavailable to the public.
Confronted with all of this constantly changing information, new mergers, and fear of cancellations, fans and creators may be uncertain about the future of animation and streaming. The answer is still not clear, but wary optimism remains. “Infinity Train’s” Owen Dennis and “Gravity Falls’” Alex Hirsch have encouraged fans to still access the canceled properties however they can, whether through physical box sets or more seafaring means. While the ethics of film and TV piracy are another discussion, the fervor fans have for still supporting artists however they can has shown contradictory statistics to the ones WB Discovery suggests: “Infinity Train” has claimed four of the top eight purchased TV shows on iTunes as other canceled HBO Max properties climb the ranks of top purchased “Kids & Family” rankings.
“Amphibia’s” Matt Braly described his thoughts as a creator and showrunner via Twitter thread. “On a streaming service, because things are 1000x more competitive than linear, you can’t just do well anymore, or good. You have to do EXCEPTIONAL,” Braly wrote. “Your show has to spike and prove beyond a doubt that subscribers are hooked.” 
The pressure of being an explosive financial success is often a struggle for showrunners that create animated content or art geared for education and children. The appeal of merchandise and toys may outshine an otherwise exceptional cartoon series. Still, financial success is not always tied to quality, and though HBO Max continues to punish its animated showrunners, the continued audience backlash against this decision shows that there is still hope for cartoons yet.

The Viterbi Graduate Student Association has partnered with the Viterbi School of Engineering to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms across the school. This partnership, called The Period Project, seeks to help bridge the gap for underrepresented groups in engineering, including menstruating people, for whom purchasing menstrual products might  pose a financial burden. 
“USC does allow students to  do community outreach, but there’s not as much effort sometimes being put on helping students with mental well-being and well-being itself,” said VGSA vice president of treasury Niraj Ganesh. “We do so much to help others, but who is helping us in our time of need?”
Ganesh, a graduate student studying product development engineering and a team member of The Period Project, said many on the team were involved in similar initiatives while they were undergraduate students. Once they met at VSGA, they decided to start The Period Project with the goal to expand it into other basic needs and departments. 
“As engineering students, with the analytical and problem solving skills that we’ve gotten … we’re thinking, ‘How can we take that and use it for something like this where you create social impact through really precise analytical movements and approaches?’” Ganesh said. 
Viterbi vice dean Kim Bregenzer, who has been the link between VGSA and the Viterbi administration, said it is very important for the school to support its students, which is why the project is fully funded by Viterbi.
“It was good that [VGSA] brought this to my attention because I think it definitely is a need for achieving gender parity in engineering to make sure we have the resources for all genders,” Bregenzer said.
Bregenzer and other members of The Period Project team are currently working with University administration to make free menstrual products available campus-wide. While the original plan was to complete the project in a year, the time frame could be extended, Bregenzer said.
“We’re currently in talks with the Student Affairs Office, as well as people at the Health Sciences Campus,” Ganesh said. “The goal is to, with their help and support, along with some of the other organizations we’re talking with, to expand this out to other departments.”
Buildings currently serviced by The Period Project include the Science & Engineering Library, Ronald Tutor Hall and the Olin Hall of Engineering. A full map with the exact bathrooms for each building can be found on the project’s website.
Students can help support the project by letting VGSA representatives know when a bathroom is missing products, Bregenzer said. They can also help by filling out the survey at the project website, which asks students which buildings they frequently visit in order to establish an order of priority to select locations for products. The project currently aims to expand to at least 50 locations at Viterbi, Ganesh said.
VGSA vice president of finance Nora Li also said it is important to spread awareness about the project so that students know the resources available to them. Students can follow @uscvgsa on Instagram to get updates on the project.

Artists and high-profile celebrities are constantly under the glow, praise and indelible scrutiny of the limelight. At any time, they may face criticism from every direction when something goes awry. That’s part of why it’s difficult for people to discuss their former favorite celebrity when they’ve been accused of something serious, or to decide whether or not to continue publicly identifying as a fan.
Enter R. Kelly. While he may not be my generation’s top singer, with few notable releases in the past couple of years, he’s one of the biggest artists for the oldheads. R. Kelly is no stranger to controversy and allegations, as his criminal actions have received a lot of attention in the past few years after the documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly” released in 2019.
The former R&B superstar spent his entire career with an issue of some sort hanging over his head. From the Aaliyah relationship debacle where they got illegally married when she was 15, to his 2002 case where a video was publicly circulated showing the singer urinating on an underage girl. 
Despite all the extra-artistic trouble early on in his career, he  evaded any convictions and continued to have a somewhat solid fanbase in the early 2000s. He’s undoubtedly created some of the R&B genre’s biggest classics, releasing “Ignition,” “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Bump N’ Grind” and “Same Girl.” He also enjoyed a high level of public regard at his peak of commercial success, being dubbed the “King Of R&B” at the turn of the millenia. However, everything started to catch up to him around six years ago.
At his ongoing trial Monday, it was revealed that, in 2007, Kelly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to recover the child pornography he had made and subsequently lost featuring his urination on an underage girl. This bombshell comes in the wake of a saga that consumed the internet when he was interviewed by Gayle King regarding allegations against Kelly for sex trafficking, which ended up being confirmed when Kelly was sentenced to serve 30 years for the offense in 2021.
The Chicago native’s case continues to grow bleaker, as charges of “producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and obstructing justice in Chicago Federal Court” have been tried against him since Aug. 17th, according to the New York Post. 
There’s no denying it, R. Kelly is nowhere near a decent human being. Yet, as was present throughout his turbulent career, we still see people calling for him to be set free. Fans of his are blind to the fact that R. Kelly is a menace to society because of their connection to his music. It’s undeniable that he’s a talented singer — I can’t say that I’ve rid his songs from my playlists because they are genuinely good and entertaining. However, that gives no reason whatsoever for people to believe that he should be pardoned for what he’s done.
I believe that people need to start separating the art from the artist. There’s been a consistent trend over the past decade where if an artist is arrested, people take to social media to post #FreeSoAndSo simply because they really enjoyed their music. I can’t deny, when my favorite artist at whatever time period would get arrested — YNW Melly, NBA Youngboy — I’d follow suit.
As the years went by, I saw how silly it was to do this, how this little meme actually caused people to genuinely believe that their favorite celebrity did nothing wrong, even if a wealth of evidence and victim testimony demonstrate the complete opposite. 
Back in 2005, Aaron McGruder, the creator of “The Boondocks,” launched an episode based around the 2002 R. Kelly trial. It depicted two groups that followed the case: One wanted to have R. Kelly sentenced, and the other wanted the singer freed to release more music. The end of the episode shows R. Kelly getting off scot-free when the crowd accuses Tom Dubois — the lawyer attempting to prosecute Kelly — of racism because his wife was white. While humorous, the episode shows the comical lengths to which people might go to neglect artists’ wrongdoings because of their creative abilities. Oh, and Kelly would later be acquitted of all charges in the real-life case in 2008.
With all this being said, I don’t think it’s wrong to enjoy R. Kelly’s music if it gives you that feel good factor or sparks some sort of memory you had way back when. What I’m saying is that you shouldn’t ignore a celebrity’s faults simply because you like their work. There’s no denying Kelly’s influence on the sound of the 2000s and on R&B at large. He was one of the biggest faces in the music industry and worked with other superstars at the time like Usher, Jay-Z, Biggie Smalls, Nas and so many others. It’s a matter of separating the art from the artist. People need to come to the realization that their favorite celebrities might be immensely flawed, and not advocate on behalf of their character due only to a love for their art.

I started this column nearly a year ago as an outlet for my rage. After what felt like a millennia of being stuck in my house in San Jose with my vexing family, the rage only condensed and grew exponentially.
It was rage against the mistreatment of healthcare workers during the pandemic, the blatant racism in the world, the imprudent actions of many who did not believe the coronavirus even existed. To put it simply, my hope in the world and in my ability to stay sane was replaced with anger; the world seemed to be crumbling and I couldn’t do anything about it.
But as I look back at that rage (after some therapist-mandated meditation), the core to my anger was my frustration with the law. 
The standard definition for the law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through institutions to regulate behavior. While there is always pushback against the law, as there’s no possible way to control everyone, its existence limits undeserved pain in the world. Yet, the decisions of those in control of the law — from policy makers to the Supreme Court — seem to have their own alternative agenda that disregards the people they are meant to protect. 
The more I wrote, the harder it became to find justice in the world. 
However, as I enter my final undergraduate year at USC, I want to leave this rage behind, because what good would any of it do? While I stand proudly by all the articles I have written and my opinions on various topics, I understand that not everyone thinks like me. If they do, the world is definitely ending. My writing is passionate because these are issues I hold close to my heart. But I only want them to stimulate conversation, not division. 
So, in trying to figure out my final installment and stoke one last conversation about the law through this column, my mind immediately turned to the shocking decisions of the Supreme Court of 2022. I’ve said my piece on abortion and Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, so I won’t talk your ear off with my two cents on that issue. But, I do wish to talk your ear off one last time about three more decisions of the Supreme Court that have caused or will cause even more disorder in the world. 
The planet is on fire
Breaking news: Climate change is real and the Supreme Court does not care. Despite the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to try and save our planet, they no longer have the authority to regulate the energy sector after the court’s decision in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency. If you thought managing climate change was difficult before, it is now nearly impossible as the EPA chokes on the regulatory reins which the Supreme Court has enforced.
According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the U.S. holds the record as the world’s greatest all-time emitter, and this latest ruling affects not only American efforts but also international efforts to curtail climate change negotiations through organizations such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change because the U.S. certainly is not contributing to the solution. But, the earth will not wait for us to all get along, it will simply continue to burn us all down with it.
School shootings should not be the reality for kids
The neverending debate over gun control has returned yet again. I truly thought that after what occurred in Uvalde, Texas last May, policy makers and the Supreme Court would be shocked into making the right decision and enforce any semblance of effective gun control to prevent situations such as school shootings from happening in the U.S. I should have listened to Zendaya’s character in “Spiderman: No Way Home” when she said “If you expect disappointment, then you can never really get disappointed,” because the court’s ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen did the exact opposite of what I hoped for. When will lives begin to matter more than a weapon that continues to kill innocent Americans?
What happened to the separation of church and state?
Roger William had a point in saying that any government involvement with the church would corrupt the church. But that goes both ways. In the cases of Carson v. Makin and Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, it seems as though justice isn’t the only thing that doesn’t exist anymore as the wall between church and state has crumbled. 
MSNBC columnist Anthea Butler said it best, that “[the] court is elevating the free exercise clause over the establishment clause and, thus, deciding that religious belief and practice should overrule the prohibition against the government favoring religion.” Since ​​1833, states have been able to provide protection for the right to religious liberty, but somehow, in 2022, we have regressed even further.
I only briefly covered these decisions with the intention of provoking you just enough to do your own research and get more involved with the world around you. I know I said anger will not solve anything, but it is a starting point. In the end, those in control of the law do not solely reside in the Supreme Court — we each hold a bit of that power. 
As I leave most of my anger and this column behind, I hope you learned something new and enjoyed the disorder that came with it.

If you had told me three years ago today that I would be sitting on a couch in the fourth floor of the Student Union, penning this and serving as the editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan, I really don’t think that I would have believed you. 
Maybe that doesn’t sound completely honest — if you look at the trajectory of my time at this publication, it might look like I’ve been primed for this role: joining the paper during my first semester on campus and working my way up the masthead’s hierarchy through the news section, onto the managing team, to my current spot. 
But I promise, assuming this position was never an end goal of mine. In fact, each semester since my very first one, I told myself and all of my friends that it would be my last — I even made a promise with a fellow editor last year that I would never, ever run for editor-in-chief. 
To put it simply, I have an extreme love-hate relationship with this publication. A journalist at heart, I love the opportunity to storytell, to talk to people and report on important news to the University community. I want to highlight the achievements of students, staff and faculty that normally fly under the radar, and I want to bring necessary attention to topics that deserve it. I’m privileged to lead a publication that has served the University community for over 100 years. In theory, I’m utterly in love with this work. 
But in practice, I must admit that this job isn’t always all sunshine and rainbows. Throughout my time at the Daily Trojan, I’ve covered difficult topics, witnessed numerous colleagues quit and seen the paper receive seemingly endless backlash for our work. I’ve cried more tears than I’m willing to admit over not having enough content to fill our pages each day and spent more class periods editing articles than paying attention. 
It’s a sacrifice that my friends don’t really understand. After all, why would anyone spend every night working on the newspaper over eating with their friends, going to a social club’s meeting or even doing their homework? They joke about the hours I spend in the newsroom when I have to turn down their dinner invitations and my never-ending Slack notifications when I pull out my laptop to edit on coffee dates. 
But in all honesty, I’d be lying if I said I completely understood it too. At times, it can all feel like too much, because, why am I spending more time in the newsroom than in my apartment or editing articles late at night after coming back from a party? 
Even more so, this job isn’t just overwhelming in sheer volume. In the mere days that I’ve led the paper for this semester so far, I’ve found myself on the intangible front lines of breaking news on heavy, sensitive topics. 
They say ignorance is bliss, and sometimes, I agree. It’s hard to know so much about subjects that wouldn’t affect me at all if I didn’t have to report on it. I love USC, but the University gets harder to love when you’re constantly writing about all of the things that are wrong with it. 
Sometimes, my work at the Daily Trojan can feel like needing to choose between being a journalist and being a student — like the two most important roles I occupy on this campus are mutually exclusive. 
Perhaps all of this is already common knowledge to the average Daily Trojan reader. You could already be aware of the blurred lines surrounding my livelihoods, and maybe you’re questioning why I felt the need to write this letter at all. 
Maybe you think of the Daily Trojan as a large publication that posts breaking news updates and sports statistics on Instagram. You might not think about the writers, photographers and editors who work day and night to produce the printed pages you’re reading right now, and the fact that they are also human.
I stand behind you in the Dulce line and walk down Trousdale Parkway next to you. I study at desks in Leavey Library and say “excuse me” as I move past you in the aisles of the Village Trader Joe’s. I cry over breakups and get my feelings hurt too. I refuse to lose my humanness or sacrifice my identity as a student for my work. 
So, thank you for giving me the space to peel back my journalist layers and to personify this paper and for reading the editions that I’m in charge of creating. And most of all, thank you for treating me and my work with grace as you remember that everyone at the Daily Trojan is simply doing their best with what they’ve got. Just like you.

With USC women’s soccer three games into their season, newly-appointed Head Coach Jane Alukonis and her team look forward to conference play to begin Sept. 23 against Stanford University. But before that, USC must get through a gauntlet of non-conference games, with matches against Texas Christian University, California State University Northridge, University of Nebraska and UC Irvine. The Daily Trojan spoke with Alukonis to discuss her vision for the upcoming match days. 
Daily Trojan: “Being that this is your first season at the helm for women’s soccer, and judging from [former Head Coach] Keidane McAlpine’s reign for the past few seasons, what expectations do you have in terms of league finish for your team?” 
Jane Alukonis: “I think that coming into the job, I knew the level of the program of current and past players is national championship level, so that’s verbiage that we use often. Of course, winning the Pac-12 is a massive honor because we have such good teams in our conference, so those are certainly two goals that we’re after this year.” 
DT: “Do you see, being that it’s a change of the coaching staff and Penelope Hocking – USC’s all-time leading goalscorer – transferred, do you see this as a quick rebuild project or a continuation of USC’s past few seasons as a whole?” 
JA: “I couldn’t be happier with the players that we have here — just the level of quality output they have been putting out everyday. So, when I look across the team, I’m just super grateful and excited. You have to rebuild in areas to get things how you like them, but [I’m] certainly not thinking that the quality or the level is going down. I’m thrilled with the level of players I get to work with on this team.” 
DT: “This offseason, there have been some recruits entering the fold, and it’s pretty comprehensive. You have two [new] defenders, a goalkeeper and a midfielder. How do you see their role and what they are going to contribute for this upcoming season?” 
JA: “I think we were super fortunate in the transfer portal, because we were able to get Nicole [Payne] and Brandi [Peterson], who have both done really well at the college level. It’s funny because they came in during preseason and they just fit right in, in terms of knowing what college is, what the demands are and just the daily grind. Jayce [Woodward] and Hannah [Dickinson] have done great as well. I know their teammates have given feedback to me in terms of just how perfectly they fit into the team. Every player, I would say, always is competing for spots but it is pretty cool that we did get two transfers that have actually played in the past with a lot of our players. So Brandi and Nicole played with Croix [Bethune] and Hannah at the club level, so that’s kind of special to be bringing some teammates back together.” 
DT: “Judging from my experience of viewing Keidane’s reign at USC, his style was more offensive first and using two pivot midfielders, and having that be the foundation for a primarily offensive game plan. What style do you want to implement for the upcoming season and future-wise?”
JA: “I think that when I’m asked that, you have to look at the current players that you have and the history of the program. I’ve always loved the fact that if SC can go forward they go forward and they’ve always been able to punish teams and put opponents on their heels, so certainly I would never want to take that away from the program or the current players. The attacking firepower is amazing, and I love it. In a nutshell, my philosophy is if you can go to goal, you go to goal. If not, you keep the ball until something opens up so that you can go to goal. It’s kind of the simplest way to put it.”

Welcome back, one and all, to the hardest hitting sports column on the Daily Trojan’s hallowed pages. Last semester saw us successfully predict the basketball national championship, call the Nets a flop before it was cool and be just a bit too harsh on Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins. I’ll start the semester with some football talk, but the rest of the sports world shouldn’t breathe easy. We’ll be back.
What an offseason it’s been for USC Football and their bright and shiny new head coach. The Trojans raided the transfer portal like it was the USC Village Target on move-in day and snagged a couple of blue-chip freshmen along the way. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams looks to be an early favorite for the Heisman Trophy and freshman cornerback Domani Jackson will wreak havoc on the defensive end with a 10.25-100m time. 
But how good will this team really be?
The Heavyweights
AP slotted USC in at No.14 behind perennially underrated North Carolina State. Bleacher Report is slightly more confident in the Trojans, putting them at No. 11, while CBS Sports goes for a compromise at No. 12. The three mainstream rankings put USC at an average place of 12.3, making them a solid, but not CFP-worthy, squad. Bleacher Report’s Kerry Miller thinks a playoff run is a legitimate possibility if the Trojans can win at Utah in mid-October. ESPN has Oregon State and University of Utah finishing above USC in the Pac-12, with the Trojans losing to the Utes in the conference championship game. Solidly mid-tier.
The Sportsbooks
Vegas Insider is higher on USC football than the media, giving the Trojans the fifth-best odds in the country to win the national championship. BetMGM has the shortest odds for USC, putting them at +2000, compared to +175 for the Alabama Crimson Tide and +350 for the reigning champion Georgia Bulldogs. The money has continued to shift the Trojans’ way this summer as big-money bettors go all in on Head Coach Lincoln Riley’s transfer-heavy team. USC will open the season as 35-point favorites against the Rice Owls.
The Pundits
Four AP poll voters left USC out of their top 25 entirely. Harry Lyles Jr. is buying what Coach Riley is selling with the trio of Caleb Williams, Jordan Addison and Travis Dye. ESPN’s Sam Acho called USC the most overrated team in the AP poll. With so many players coming into the program, Acho doesn’t think the Trojans will be able to turn around last year’s abysmal defense. Paul Finebaum called Riley a “top five coach.” There’s no consensus among the TV talking heads, and some of them are going to look really good when November rolls around. The rest — well, they aren’t paid to be accurate.
The Wildcards
Notable college football Instagram account @biggameboomer is low on USC, putting them at 21, just ahead of former USC quarterback Kedon Slovis’ University of Pittsburgh. Bill Connelley calls USC “unprojectable.” Various couch experts have put USC as low as out of the top 25 and as high as fourth. With so many new variables on the team, it’s hard to guess where the Trojans will end up. That leads nicely into our last section: me attempting to do exactly that.
My Predictions
I might be the worst person on campus to go to for a prediction. Last year, I was filmed for a USC TV show saying I believed the football team would bounce back after former Head Coach Clay Helton’s firing and finish the year strong. They would go on to lose seven of their next 10 games. With that sterling prediction in the back window, I’ll try again in a year that should be more favorable to preseason prognostics. I think the team will come together in Riley’s first year, winning out until their trip to Utah. After that, the team will bounce back with easy wins over Arizona, University of California, Berkeley and University of Colorado, Boulder. A back-and-forth rivalry game across town will end with USC up two touchdowns, but the regular season will end with a loss at home to Notre Dame over Thanksgiving break.

Following a disappointing 4-8 finish last season, USC Football looks to drastically improve after major offseason changes. With the addition of Head Coach Lincoln Riley and the number one ranked transfer class, the Trojans have an opportunity to return to the national spotlight.
With transfers such as wide receiver and last year’s Biletnikoff Award winner Jordan Addison and quarterback Caleb Williams, a semi-finalist for the 2021 Shaun Alexander Freshman of the Year Award, the No. 14 ranked Trojans seem set to begin the season. But who stands in the Trojans’ way? Here are USC’s five toughest football matchups this fall.
Oct. 15 at Utah
Utah will be USC’s toughest matchup of the season as the defending Pac-12 Conference champions. The Utes have already emerged as the favorites to win the Pac-12. Utah defeated USC 42-26 last season in Los Angeles.  
Utah returns two offensive threats this season in running back Tavion Thomas and quarterback Cameron Rising. Last season, Thomas rushed for 21 touchdowns in a powerful Utah running attack. In addition to the run, Rising finished the season with 20 touchdowns and only five interceptions. The strongest team in the Pac-12 to start, this early road game in Salt Lake City will not be one to miss. 
Nov. 26 versus Notre Dame
The game against No. 5 ranked Notre Dame has the potential to be a crucial last minute playoff resumé boost for the Trojans. USC has not taken a game from the Fighting Irish in their last four meetings, winning just three times since former Head Coach Pete Carroll left in 2009. As this will be the final game of the regular season, many postseason implications may result from this outcome. A loss to Notre Dame could spoil the season for USC, especially if the Trojans lose to Utah.
If all goes to plan, a win against Notre Dame will prove USC is ready to face the elite competition of college football. Regardless of circumstance, USC’s rivalry against Notre Dame will be an exciting matchup for USC to right the ship of their losses over the last several years. 
Nov. 19 at UCLA
No Trojan fan wants to relive the agony of last season’s 62-33 loss to UCLA. Last season, Head Coach Chip Kelly led the Bruins to their best finish since 2014, going 8-4. The battle for the Victory Bell is always a heavily anticipated matchup, but this season, the Trojans are looking for revenge and to reclaim the bell.
UCLA retains quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, a player who put up 349 total yards against the Trojans last year. He finished the 2021 season with 21 touchdowns and six interceptions. This season, the Trojans will face a test against UCLA at the Rose Bowl.
Sept. 17 versus Fresno State
While many people may assume this is an easy win for the Trojans, the Fresno State Bulldogs finished 10-3 in the Mountain West Cconference last season. In an electric matchup last season, Fresno State defeated No. 13 UCLA on the road. The Bulldogs scored under 20 points just two times last season, so Trojan fans can expect a high-scoring affair under the lights at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Fresno State’s quarterback Jake Haener passed for over 4,000 yards last season and finished with 33 touchdowns. With a solid defense, Fresno State has the potential to disrupt USC’s expected success early in the season. 
Sept. 10 at Stanford
Last season, USC’s astonishing loss to the Cardinal was the beginning of the end for the Trojans’ 2021 bowl season hopes. Former Head Coach Clay Helton was let go following this game, the first domino that fell in 2021 for USC. Just like last year, Stanford is USC’s second matchup and the first conference game of the season. The Trojans will travel north to Stanford Stadium.
Although Stanford is predicted to finish eighth in the Pac-12, this will be a revenge game for the Trojans in the best form. Stanford returns 10 starters this season, including quarterback Tanner McKee. Regardless of Stanford’s preseason rank, the matchup against the Cardinal will be USC’s chance to prove how far they’ve come this offseason.
