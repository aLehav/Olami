In a unanimous vote, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed a resolution to create gender-neutral housing on campus during Tuesday night’s Senate meeting.
The resolution proposes a “gender-neutral” option on USC housing applications and the creation of gender-neutral housing facilities to accommodate USC students who don’t identify within the male/female gender binary.
The resolution was proposed by members of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly. Its passage was followed by celebration and congratulation amongst proponents and supporting senators.
“I’d like to thank the members of QuASA and everyone else who helped us with this resolution,” said Vice President Rini Sampath, who co-sponsored the bill along with Senator Brianna Thorpe. “I’m looking forward to working with the Senate to pass this resolution.”
Sampath, a Daily Trojan columnist, believes that the bill’s passage is a testament to the hard work of both USG and student officials, and that it’s a landmark moment for USG in backing gender rights.
“To get this resolution to Senate is really meaningful. Many students as well as provosts and university officials have been working on it, and I think it’s a step toward a more equal campus,” Sampath said.
Former USG Senator Logan Heley helped present the bill last week. Heley believes it’s time for USC to catch up to other universities in gender issues.
“USC is behind a lot of other comparable universities on gender-neutral housing, and it’s about time we as a Trojan Family make our home comfortable for all students,” Heley said.
Currently, the resolution is non-binding. Sampath, however, said she is taking steps to communicate with the administration and ensure that the resolution changes actual policy.
“I want to make sure these resolutions aren’t just ‘pieces of paper,’ that they’re listened to,” Sampath said. “It’s going to be taken to President [C. L. Max] Nikias’ office, and it will allow us to have one-on-one conversations with administrators to see why we need to make these changes on campus.”

On Tuesday night, the Trojan Entertainment Connection hosted actors from Mean Girls, One Tree Hill and Even Stevens at its annual Spring Actors Panel in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

The panel included professional actors Paul Johansson, Daniel Franzese, Steven Anthony Lawrence, Stephen Colletti and Bethany Joy Lenz.
“We’re excited to continue the trend of One Tree Hill and Mean Girls, because we had Lee Norris in the fall and last spring we had James Lafferty and Jonathan Bennett,” said TEC co-president Shannon Stern. “I planned the panel of actors and actresses of TV shows and movies I love because what better way to end my tenure at USC than that.”
Panelists spoke to students about a wide variety of their experiences in the industry, ranging from their favorite moments to challenges they are still dealing with today.
Stern began the discussion by asking panelists to speak about how they first began acting. While each panelist took a different path to finding their love for acting, all five agreed that passion and drive are the most crucial keys to success.
“You need to absolutely have a love affair with [acting], or else don’t do it because otherwise it’s too hard … It’s a lifestyle choice,” Johansson said.
Many of the panelists found their passion for acting at a young age. Franzese, who was unable to take acting lessons growing up because of his family’s financial situation, said he would go to his local Starbucks in Barnes & Noble when he was growing up and read acting books for hours.
Most importantly, Franzese said, students should just “start making stuff.” He said that there is no better way to begin a career in acting than to make your own project and start practicing.
“You’ll start making bad things, and more bad things, and next time it’ll be not so bad, and you just get good at it eventually,” Franzese said. “Your biggest value is your youth so start your kickstarter and buy your camera or do something low-budget with your laptop but make stuff. It’ll be bad at first but it doesn’t matter, it’s about the idea of creation.”
The actors did acknowledge, however, that the road to a successful career in the entertainment industry is not an easy one. They discussed challenges they have faced along the way, such as sexism, overcoming stereotypes or finding one’s own identity. Lenz offered perspective about the challenges of being a woman in the entertainment industry.
“You deal with producers on set that want to smack you on the ass, and joke about being their next girlfriend and there is only so much you can do about it, unfortunately,” Lenz said. “It’s a real unique challenge trying to navigate who you are as a woman and [being] comfortable in your own skin … but the industry is  continuing to get so much more [female] friendly than years ago.”
Franzese, who came out as gay for the first time publicly yesterday, said he has had to work around the “gay glass ceiling” that exists, and directors and producers who thought he couldn’t play certain roles.
Students such as Elena Legan, a sophomore majoring in biology, said she appreciated the honesty of the panelists and how they shared personal stories from their lives.
“They were so real with us and their answers made them seem like actual people and not just celebrities,” Legan said.
Former One Tree Hill star Colletti shared that his identity as an actor is still developing. After temporarily putting his love for theater aside in high school in order to pursue sports, he said that when Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County came to his hometown and wanted to film a reality show, it was “fate and pure luck.” He was able to use the show as a platform to become a host on MTV’s Total Request Live and later starred as the character Chase Adams on One Tree Hill.
“I feel like I’m still becoming an actor because there’s so much more to learn,” Colletti said.
Student actors and  non-actors alike took the panelists’ messages to heart. Rachel Rubin, a freshman majoring in business and cinematic arts, said that although she does not plan to make a career out of acting, panelists still had valuable information to offer.
“I liked how they emphasized knowing yourself and knowing where you want to go because that applies to any industry,” Rubin said.

Marc Benioff, CEO and chairman of salesforce.com, will deliver the university’s 131st commencement address, USC officials announced yesterday. Six honorary degree recipients, including Benioff, were also announced.
The five additional honorary degree recipients include B. Wayne Hughes, the founder and chairman of Public Storage, the largest self-storage company in the world; Shonda L. Rhimes, the creator and executive producer of several ABC series such as Grey’s Anatomy, Private Practice and Scandal; Phillip A. Sharp, a Nobel laureate who has made significant discoveries in the understanding of genetic relations to  cancer and other ailments; James Simons, the founder of the successful hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and the Simons Foundation, which is a leader in mathematical research and basic sciences and Twyla Tharp, one of the United States’ premier dancers and choreographers.
Benioff is recognized as one of the pioneers of cloud computing. Both he and Hughes are USC alumni and trustees. Rhimes is a USC alumna.
Graduating seniors expressed mixed reactions about Benioff being announced as the commencement speaker. Students such as Lindsay Rapkin, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said that she wished the speaker was someone who was more well-known and relatable to the general population of seniors.
“I had to look him up, which I think says something for itself,” Rapkin said. “I do not feel that a tech billionaire is someone a lot of us can relate to. Also, USC places a large focus on business, but we are an extremely diverse academic institution and we have so many other interests.”
Chelsey Christensen, a senior majoring in communication, expressed similar sentiments. She mentioned that she did not know much about Benioff initially and had to look up additional information online.
“When I found out what he does, I thought it was ironic because it’s so USC to pick someone like that,” Christensen said. “I’m sure he will have cool things to talk about, but being in Annenberg I’m not as interested in hearing about business. It’s an interesting choice for the main ceremony but I don’t think it represents USC’s diverse interests.”
For some students in the Marshall School of Business, the chance to hear Benioff speak is an exciting prospect. Lauren Estrada, a senior majoring in business administration, said that she is looking forward to hearing Benioff speak because she is interested in what he has accomplished professionally. She also said, however, that she understood why students in other schools would not be as interested.
The speakers for individual schools can be found on USC’s website.

USC Program Board hosted actor and environmental activist Ian Somerhalder Tuesday night in Bovard Auditorium. Somerhalder spoke on his foundation, the environment and what youths can do to empower and educate each other to create change.
Green fever · Vampire Diaries actor and founder of the Ian Somerhalder Foundation Ian Somerhalder discussed the importance of clean energy and animal rights on Tuesday. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
In Hollywood, Somerhalder is best known for prominent roles on the television shows The Vampire Diaries and Lost. He can also be seen on Years of Living Dangerously, Showtime’s new docu-series centering on global climate change that premiered on April 13.
Hosted in conjunction with the Speakers Committe, the International Student Assembly and the Environmental Student Assembly, the event was moderated by Alex Ago, the director of programming and special projects at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts.
ESA Director Shawn Rhoads said that they chose Somerhalder as the Earth Day speaker because they knew he had the capability to reach a larger demographic.
“We want people to know that an environmental community exists on campus,” Rhoads said. “There’s a need for action, and that’s what ESA wants to do — along with creating awareness for positive impact — through Earth month, and we thought that Ian would be a good fit as keynote speaker for our message.”
He stressed that as a celebrity, he is in a fortunate position of having an amplified voice to enact change.
“The ultimate goal is to do the absolute best I can to empower all those around me to start living this holistic framework of life that will last way beyond me,” Somerhalder said.
Somerhalder spoke heavily about the mission of his foundation, the Ian Somerhalder Foundation, which aims to educate a collective audience on the importance of preserving the environment and the world’s animals.
Throughout the evening, Somerhalder stressed the need for youth empowerment, and also discussed how today’s generation can enact real differences in the world.
“[You should use] social media to create quantifiable change,” he said. “If you can empower them with education, now they’re activated and they become a doer. This generation knows that, and what people and corporations aren’t realizing is that the most underutilized weapon in the worth is youth — and they’re going to change the world.”
Somerhalder said that the environment is very delicate, and relies heavily on the “symbiosis” between man and animal.
“The foundation’s focuses all go hand in hand, and the intricate nature of our environment revolves around symbiosis of the creatures of the world and humans,” Somerhalder said. “It can lead to food shortages, along coastlines that go into cities, and we can’t function without them — which is why we need species and environmental conservation.”
He also spoke about the ISF college division, which encourages the collaboration between environmentally conscious students on campus.
“You will find like-minded people around you, and it gives you all the tools to execute things, and empower you to do so much more,” Somerhalder said.
He also noted that he models his lifestyle after the mission of his foundation, and that people should aim to eliminate wasteful habits such as leaving the television on during the day when no one is home.
“I try and live my life the same way we want to power people at ISF, Somerhalder said. “The dog does not need to watch TV when you’re gone all day — it will lick itself all day,” he said. “Making a pledge to do stuff is great, doing them is better. We have to be better consumers and voters — this shift will shape the world.”
After the event, students said that they were intrigued with Somerhalder’s message and his ability as a celebrity to reach a wider audience.
Natalie Milian, a sophomore majoring in communication, believed that Somerhalder was a boost to the Environmental Student Assembly and its cause.
“[Somerhalder’s] popularity gives him this powerful mode of speech and increases the amount of people that he can deliver his message to,” Milian said. “And while people may be there just to gaze at him, they will still surely come out of the event with gaining at least some information [and] knowledge about his cause.”
Sucharita Yellapragada, a freshman majoring in policy, planning and development, believed that Somerhalder’s talk had been a reminder of the dire situation that our world is in.
“Ian being here [is a] statement about how big of an impact the environment has on our daily life — that celebrities take the time to create charities and work tirelessly to strive towards a change,” Yellapragada said. “It gathers students together for a common cause and it really helps that someone as prominent as Ian Somerhalder came to talk to us about it.”

After reclaiming the No. 1 spot in men’s collegiate tennis, the Trojans have yet another cause for celebration: junior Yannick Hanfmann’s spectacular performance against crosstown rival UCLA last week earned him Pac-12 Player of the Week honors. This pair of triumphs for USC and one of its star players is a testament to the chemistry Hanfmann has built with the rest of his team.
Best of the best · Junior Yannick Hanfmann upset UCLA’s Clay Thompson, the No. 1 singles player in the country, during the Trojans’ victory over the Bruins last week. Hanfmann is now 18-5 in singles play this season. – Jazmine Rolle | Daily Trojan
Hanfmann left everything he had on court one against the Bruins in the Trojans’ home success over UCLA on Friday, serving up dominating doubles play alongside senior Ray Sarmiento before also demonstrating his singles prowess in an upset of Clay Thompson, who is currently seated atop the national leader board. The No. 2 duo of Hanfmann and Sarmiento found its way to an 8-4 win over the Bruins’ Marcos Giron and Karue Sell, who are currently ranked No. 58 nationally.
In his solo outing, Hanfmann was unyielding in his clash with Thompson, clinching the first set 6-4 before finding himself at a 1-3 disadvantage in the next. He would soldier on to win the second set 7-5 with a powerful finish over the star Bruin, which would bring USC to a 2-1 lead over UCLA. The Trojans eventually toppled the Bruins with a final score of 4-2.
USC’s victory sealed its 7-0 finish in Pac-12 play for the season, with its undefeated record ensuring the No. 1 seed in the upcoming Pac-12 Tournament. This also marks the second time in the past four seasons that USC has finished regular-season Pac-12 play undefeated. The Trojans ended the season with a 25-2 mark overall, while UCLA boasts a 20-3 overall record and a 6-1 mark in conference play.
The successful game against UCLA comes as the Trojans’ 16th straight win. Hanfmann’s defeat of No. 1 Thompson brought him to an 18-5 record in singles play on the season, and his doubles record with Sarmiento sits at 13-1.
This is Hanfmann’s second conference Player of the Week award this season — the native of  Karlsruhe, Germany was also honored after his team’s sweep of Florida and Georgia in the Pac-12/SEC Showdown in early February. Hanfmann’s teammate, junior Roberto Quiroz, has won the award twice, and Sarmiento has won once.

After finishing the regular season with a disappointing 6-4 loss to the No. 3 UCLA Bruins last week, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team (22-2, 5-2) jumped back into the pool one last time before kicking off the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoffs this weekend. This time, their opponent wasn’t representing a particular university, but rather the red, white and blue. The Women of Troy played host to the U.S. Junior National Team in a friendly exhibition match on Tuesday afternoon.
Double dip · USC junior two-meter Eike Daube played for the Women of Troy yesterday in an exhibition contest against her other squad, the USA Junior National Team. Daube has 36 goals for USC so far this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“I’ve trained with a lot of these girls before so it’s almost like a reunion,” said junior two-meter Eike Daube, who was a member of the U.S. Junior National Team in 2013. “It’s definitely good to get out of the routine of practice and scrimmage. I thought it was a really good transition for us, especially with the games coming up this weekend.”
Displaying a complete change of form following a season-low four goals against the Bruins, the Cardinal and Gold got on the scoreboard early and often against the National Team. Less than a minute into the game, junior driver Monica Vavic rocketed in a goal to set off the scoring frenzy.
Leading the collection of current high school and former collegiate players making up the national team, the Women of Troy took control of the game on both sides of the ball, gathering a 10-3 advantage by halftime.
Senior goalie Flora Bolonyai, tied for most saves in USC’s program history, tallied five first-half stops to complement the fierce offense.
After breaks in between each quarter to work on powerplay strategies, the Women of Troy continued their domination into the fourth period, leading 16-6. Though the offense was brought to a standstill in the final quarter of play, a stout defensive effort carried USC to victory, 17-9.
For the Women of Troy, who head into the MPSF tournament this weekend, the scrimmage was a valuable tool for practice.
“It’s fun. We know them from the past and every game is good practice for us,” said senior co-captain and current U.S. National Team member Kaleigh Gilchrist. “Right now our number one priority is USC’s team and coming into the postseason we need every chance we can to practice on our fundamentals and keep working. It was a good practice.”
Following a versatile offensive display on Tuesday, the Women of Troy look to continue the streak and put the troubles that appeared against UCLA behind them as they host Arizona State on Friday afternoon.

When you think of smash-mouth defenses in college football, it’s hard not to rattle off a list of SEC programs that come to mind. Alabama, Auburn, Florida, LSU — all of these names carry a distinct aura of having the type of physical ballhawks and devastating strength in the trenches that evoke a certain brand of football. Defense, as the saying goes, wins championships. And if we break it down to conferences, seven out of the last eight BCS National Champions have been SEC teams. The Pac-12, on the other hand, hasn’t won a national championship since it was the Pac-10 — the Trojans destroyed Oklahoma en route to a 55-19 victory in 2005.
Legacy · Former interim head coach Ed Orgeron and his defensive unit put fear into Pac-12 offenses last season, recording 25 turnovers. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Pardon me for sounding like ol’ Grandpa Simpson, but back in those days, it was the Trojan defensive dynasties led by the likes of Mike Patterson, Lofa Tatupu, Clay Matthews and Brian Cushing wreaking havoc on their hapless, undersized opponents in the Pac-10/12. Since then, the perception of defensive power in college football has swung from sunny Southern California skies to the charmed football culture of the Deep South — but that doesn’t mean that the Pac-12 is now a defensive wasteland.
It’s no secret that the Trojans had a rather strong defensive presence last season under former head coaches Lane Kiffin and Ed Orgeron. The Trojans had 17 interceptions and eight forced fumbles last season, and finished 16th in the nation in scoring defense, allowing 21.2 points per game. The knock-down, drag out defensive style employed by the Trojans last season and the pro-style, run-heavy offense was reminiscent of the type of play of many SEC teams.
The Trojans’ one (rather glaring and massive) defensive hiccup last season was against Arizona State: USC gave up 612 yards of total offense and seven touchdowns. But for the Trojans to end up with the 16th best scoring defense in the Football Bowl Subdivision in a conference that is infamous for housing high-powered offenses is no small feat. The fact that the Trojans have to compete with such stiff offensive competition only makes their defensive prowess that much more impressive.
The spring game was a revelation for the Trojans: The defense that had been playing “catch-up” all spring with the implementation of head coach Steve Sarkisian’s new uptempo offense seemed poised to execute in the red zone to prevent touchdowns. It’s not a given that USC’s offense will repeat such a shaky performance going into fall camp, but give credit where it’s due: the Trojans’ defense is recovering nicely from the loss of Dion Bailey, Morgan Breslin, George Uko, Demetrius Wright and others to both graduation and the NFL.
At the head of this USC optimism is former 5-star recruit Su’a Cravens, whose performance as a true freshman safety last season was considered a pleasant surprise. Given an extra year of practice in a college-speed defense, Cravens will only get stronger and more experienced — a scary thought for Pac-12 offenses that were reluctant to throw intermediate routes and running between the tackles against a stout front seven that was flanked by the then-true freshman.
The defensive line is also receiving its share of reinforcements, with former 5-star recruit Kenny Bigelow filling in at tackle and transfer-recruit Claude Pelon providing much-needed depth with the departure of Breslin and Uko. Bigelow and Pelon will join All-American junior defensive lineman Leonard Williams, who was virtually unstoppable when he stepped on the field last season. Williams told Bruce Feldman of CBS Sports that he was playing at “65 percent” last season during his All-American campaign due to his torn labrum.
Williams has sat out for much of the spring, but predicts that he will be 100 percent before summer. I don’t think I need to state what a fully healthy Leonard Williams means for opposing running backs and offensive linemen next season. Unlike wide receivers such as Marqise Lee, the capabilities and performance of Williams don’t suffer from a drop-off due to a quarterback change or a different system on offense. Williams made headlines under former defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin’s system by making the Freshman All-American Team, in addition to making the All-American Team under Clancy Pendergast’s 5-2 system last season, and in all likelihood he will swallow up mere mortal offensive linemen en route to another All-American honor this coming season under current defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox.
Williams is the linchpin in the front seven, and redshirt senior defensive back Josh Shaw will helm the Trojans’ secondary. Shaw, who returned for his senior season despite competitive prospects in the NFL, was integral in the Trojans’ pass defense in the second half of last season. Though he’s not quite a shutdown “island” cornerback just yet, he has the reliability and instincts to prevent big plays — and create a couple big plays in his own right.
The Trojans are no longer the defensive juggernaut they once were in the early-to-mid 2000s under Pete Carroll — that ship has sailed. What is possible, and is happening before our very eyes, might be the power of Pac-12 offenses shaping subsequently strong defenses. The Trojans — the last Pac-10 or Pac-12 team to win a national championship — are en route to leading the pack to making the Pac-12 a conference not just renowned for its innovative offensive schemes and thrilling quarterback play, but hard-nosed, nasty defense — and it should only be a matter of time before that defense wins championships.

The No. 1-ranked USC women’s golf team will attempt to defend its Pac-12 tournament title this weekend at the Trysting Tree G.C. in Corvallis, Ore. The event, hosted by Oregon State, will feature five other top-10 teams — No. 2 UCLA, No. 4 Arizona State, No. 7 Stanford, No. 9 Arizona and No. 10 Washington.

It has been a banner year for the Women of Troy, who had never started a golf season by winning more than one event. This year, however, they crushed that record by claiming championships in their first five events.
Though the Women of Troy have used a variety of lineups in its regular season events this year, head coach Andrea Gaston has decided that this weekend will feature a group of golfers she has utilized four times already this season. Gaston has chosen senior Sophia Popov, junior Doris Chen, sophomores Annie Park and Kyung Kim, and freshman Karen Chung.
The women’s team will tee off on Friday at 9:40 a.m. with 7th-seed Oregon. USC has now won 11 of its past 13 tournaments, and 15 of 19 going all the way back to the fall of 2012. This spring, the veteran group of players includes all five members from last year’s team that won the NCAA title by a record 21 strokes.
The No. 21-ranked men’s golf team will also be busy this weekend, traveling to The Gallery G.C. in Marana, Ariz., for its own Pac-12 Championship.
The men’s team will look to bounce back from their performance at the Western Intercollegiate Golf Tournament last weekend. The Trojans finished sixth, behind four teams that will be competing against them this weekend in Tucson, Ariz. Among them are No. 3 Cal, No. 6 Stanford and No. 17 Washington. Head coach Chris Zambri noted that his team would need to improve on their previous performance, and play as a collective unit, in order to play at their potential.
“They all have areas of their game that they focus on in order to play well. As coaches, we may try to shine a light on something that needs improvement,” Zambri said. “Rare is the golfer without an area in need of improvement. They have all been working tremendously hard and smart in the days and weeks leading up to this stretch run.”
Freshman Rico Hoey, a newly selected U.S. Palmer Cup Team participant, will look to lead his team this weekend. Hoey tied for third place at the team’s last event, one of his seven top-seven finishes so far this season. The Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native will represent the U.S. in England at the Palmer Cup this summer. Four other Trojans have played in the event in program history, the last being Tim Sluiter in 2008 and 2009.
Besides the tough finish at the Western Intercollegiate, the Trojans enter this weekend after finishing top two in three out of their four previous events. Starting with 36 holes this Friday, and concluding with 18 holes each on Saturday and Sunday, the Trojans will start the Pac-12 championships teeing off at 6:30 a.m. along with California and Colorado.
Zambri and women’s head coach Andrea Gaston are no strangers to this type of golf competition. Gaston recently helped the Women of Troy win the NCAA championship in 2013, and Zambri’s résumé includes a plethora of individual and team champions that he has produced while coaching at USC. The eighth-year coach is confident in his team’s chances over the weekend.
“We are a good enough team to win the Pac-12,” Zambri said. “In order to do so, though, each of our six players will need to play well. We have two seniors who are great Trojans that will be graduating in May — Ramsey Sahyoun and Jeffrey Kang. It would be great to send them off with a Pac-12 title.”
If one thing is certain, both the women’s and men’s teams contain all the tools needed to succeed this weekend at the Pac-12 championships. Both groups of golfers have consistently shown that they can compete soundly with the toughest competition, and this weekend will only provide these teams with a stage to showcase the talent that they have polished all season long.

To his coaches and teammates, Jalen Greene is fearless. The true freshman quarterback, who graduated a semester early from athletic powerhouse Junipero Serra High School, in Gardena, Calif. has acted like a seasoned veteran rather than a wide-eyed newcomer since he arrived on USC’s campus this spring.
Young gun · Freshman quarterback Jalen Greene was highly successful while playing at Serra-Gardena High School, but has been overshadowed by other USC quarterback recruits, namely Max Browne and Ricky Town. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
While his former classmates prepare themselves for the senior prom, and with former Serra teammates and future Trojans Adoree’ Jackson and Olajuwon Tucker set to arrive at USC in the summer, Greene has spent his days taking command of the offensive huddle as if he were the Trojans’ starting quarterback. As a three-year starter in high school who won CIF and state championships as a junior, Greene has the accolades that warrant such confidence.
But if Greene is being honest, as he was during his first interviews with the media at the end of spring practice, he admits that confidence did not come so easily at first.
“I was a bit nervous,” Greene said of his first time in a USC huddle. “I don’t know that any of the guys will tell you that they noticed that, though. It’s about coming out here and commanding the huddle, that’s what quarterbacks have to do to show leadership.”
Greene was not on the Trojans’ radar for much of his recruitment phase, but developed a strong relationship with Steve Sarkisian before he was named USC’s new head coach. After Sarkisian moved south, Greene, whose hometown is Inglewood, Calif., was quick to follow him right back home.
“I wasn’t really looking into USC that much before the coaching change,” Greene said. “Once the coaches changed, they all started calling me and I started looking into it. I believed in Coach Sark’s system that he ran up at Washington. I knew a couple guys that he recruited that were up there, and they told me they like him as a coach. He does a lot, and he’s a great guy.”
That Greene was a late addition to USC’s recruiting class of 2014 is fitting, considering that to many Trojan fans who obsessively check recruiting rankings and online message boards, that is exactly what Greene is viewed as — an afterthought.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne was the top quarterback in his class. Ricky Town, a USC commit who is ranked as the No. 5 quarterback in the class of 2015, according to ESPN, is already being heralded as the next great Trojan signal caller, which seems to leave Greene as the odd man out as far as playing time is concerned.
But that’s not how Greene sees things. Though he was written off early on in this spring’s quarterback competition, his goal is to win the job someday in the future. While his athleticism might allow him to earn playing time at another position, Greene has no intentions of changing anytime soon.
“It didn’t affect me that much, hearing that Cody [Kessler] was starting,” Greene said. “I’ve been learning a lot from him and Max [Browne], and I just want to continue to learn from them. I had higher hopes for myself this spring. I wouldn’t say I had a bad spring, but I progressed a lot, and I just have to keep progressing each day.”
Knowing that playing time would be hard to come by this season, and that little was expected from him, Greene played with confidence all spring and left a strong impression on his coaches. He might be destined for a redshirt season in 2014, but he showed enough talent to instill confidence that he could be “the guy” in the coming years.
“I think Jalen has a very high ceiling here,” Sarkisian said. “I think his future is very bright. He has steadily improved along the way. We have high expectations for him.”
While the rest of the USC offense struggled to grasp Sarkisian’s new offensive scheme, Greene picked it up quicker than most due to the fact that he ran a very similar offense in high school. This familiarity helped ease the growing pains that every young player goes through when he or she goes against college players for the first time.
“I’ve been really, really pleased with him,” offensive coordinator Clay Helton said. “I’m very excited about how fast he’s picked up the concepts and how hard he’s working mechanically to fix some things. You can see the liveliness of his arm. He has very, very good tools and will be a very promising quarterback here.”
Currently, Greene is clearly No. 3 in USC’s pecking order at quarterback. He admittedly struggled with the speed of the defense at times during practice, and his mechanics are still a work in progress. That he will be surrounded by more polished competition for years to come gives credibility to the notion that he might be more likely to see the field at another position, or even another school.
Still, Greene believes that it’s far too early in his career to write him off yet, and that someday he will be announced as USC’s starting quarterback.
“That’s the plan,” Greene said. “I’m just gonna keep competing every time I’m here. I came here to play quarterback. I was recruited as a quarterback. Hopefully that’s what they have in store for me.”

Hollywood is the unequivocal center of the entertainment industry. But with the world experiencing a massive technology boom over the last decade, largely caused by the massive concentration of computer programmers living in the northern California region known as Silicon Valley, television and film producers are starting to find ripe material in this quiet suburban setting.
The most splashy of these projects has undoubtedly been James Franco’s Palo Alto, which received a publicity boost earlier this month when Franco made headlines for toeing the line between his role in the upcoming film (as a teacher who hooks up with one of his students) and real life, after exchanging suggestive texts with an underage fan.
Preliminary reviews for Palo Alto have been quite positive — but it will have stiff competition from the smaller screen for the most amusing portrayal of NorCal’s high-tech hub.
On Monday, HBO renewed Silicon Valley, a new single-camera comedy from Mike Judge, who already has experience helming a brilliant workplace satire in 1999’s cult classic Office Space. Silicon Valley proves that Judge knows what it takes to succeed in the world of cable television too, more than two decades after he entered the mainstream with MTV’s Beavis and Butt-head and hit it big with FOX’s King in the Hill. Considering the blue-collar subjects of those two shows, it might surprise some to see Judge focus on the decidedly white-collar setting of Palo Alto. But after taking in a few episodes of Silicon Valley, it’s clear that Judge has spent enough time in the South Bay to accurately parody its inhabitants with a sense of subtle bite that could evoke chortles from even the driest of the software engineers he’s making fun of.
The show follows a group of young coders who toil for a big-name software giant during the day and try to develop their own apps by night, hoping they’ll make something appealing enough to subsequently sell for millions of dollars and live comfortably for the rest of their days. The crew all lives together under the watch of slobby stoner Erlich (T.J. Miller), who has already cashed in and hopes to “give back” by funding rent for the entire group at a nerdy bachelors’ pad in exchange for a piece of whatever app they create. As the story begins, however, the most promising thing any of them has come up with is “NipAlert” (exactly what it sounds like) — until Richard (Thomas Middleditch) unwittingly creates a ground-breaking algorithm while working on his fledging app, Pied Piper, that catches the attention of head honchos across the Valley.
This concept has obviously found its target audience on HBO, as Silicon Valley’s premiere marked the network’s most-watched comedy debut since Hung in 2009 — an impressive feat considering the lack of star power in the cast. It has probably benefitted ratings-wise from serving as the centerpiece of an absolute blockbuster Sunday night on HBO — Game of Thrones at 9 p.m., Silicon Valley at 10 p.m., Veep at 10:30 p.m. — but Judge’s latest project really doesn’t need to be aided by that gigantic lead-in (and who watches television live anymore, anyway? Just use your — wink wink — HBOGo account).
It might be hard for some to truly sympathize with Richard, who at first comes off as a relatively inaccessible main character — too shy and boring, despite the occasional showing of confidence necessary to function as Pied Piper’s CEO. But I suspect that as the show goes along, and Pied Piper climbs the ladder that all startups must take on in order to achieve success, Richard will become more engaging to viewers as he grows into his executive role while still maintaining the endearing naiveté that makes him a viable protagonist in the first place.
Miller’s performance stands out among the other programmers, as he is truly excellent at perfecting the balance between confidently slimy and likeable that many techies have exhibited while riding to the top (ahem, Steve Jobs). Lesser shows would be brought down by the idle racial stereotypes that Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) and Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) occasionally throw at each other, but Starr and Nanjiani combine for so much otherwise witty banter that those low points can be easily forgiven.
A deeply weird venture capitalist named Peter Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch) also lurks as an advisor and potential investor for Pied Piper — although it appears he won’t be for much longer, hinting at a major plot shift in the next couple weeks. Welch died of lung cancer in December with only five-and-a-half (out of eight) episodes of the show’s inaugural season completed. This seemingly throws a wrench into Silicon Valley’s story arc considering Gregory’s prominent involvement in the first few episodes, although Judge says that Welch’s passing won’t drastically affect the plotline. Luckily, it shouldn’t affect the number of laughs the show produces, either — on the most recent episode, Gregory’s winding side plot involving Burger King and the sesame seeds it uses was a bit too quirky and ultimately superfluous.
Overall, though, Silicon Valley appears poised to thrive. The show pointedly teases Judge’s techie targets over their ambitions to “make the world a better place” through iPhone apps and file-compressing software. Silicon Valley, in all likelihood, won’t even make as lasting of an impact on the world as those innovations do, or even as impactful as Office Space was on the comedy industry — but the entertainment world is undoubtedly a better place with Mike Judge in it.

Wednesday marks Shakespeare’s 450th birthday. Some might be celebrating by reading their favorite play. Others, by swooning over actor Leonardo DiCaprio in Romeo + Juliet. A group of USC alumni, however, is celebrating in a big way — by premiering their web series all about the Bard on Hulu.
‘Shake’ it · (Left to right) Ben Sidell (Ian), Lizzie Fabie (Regan), Alex Skinner (Leo), Chase Williamson (Oliver), Lili Fuller (Pauline), Joe Sofranko (Hal) receive news in the dressing room during an episode of Complete Works, a new Hulu series now available for free. – Photo courtesy of Hulu
Complete Works centers around Hal, a Midwestern Shakespeare-phile who lands himself a last-minute spot in the finals of a cutthroat Shakespeare acting competition. Inspired by iconic comedies such as Mean Girls and Waiting for Gufman, Hal must struggle both to find his own in the competition and to interact with his fellow contestants, a group of characters as crazy as those in Shakespeare’s plays.
Producers Lili Fuller, Adam North and Joe Sofranko both graduated from USC’s School of Theatre (now the School of Dramatic Arts) in 2010. Soon afterward, the two felt the need to create a project where they had full creative control.
“We wanted to make something to keep us going,” Fuller said.
The idea to focus their project around a Shakespeare competition came from their own experiences — Sofranko won the National Shakespeare Competition while in high school, and Fuller and Sofranko first met through the YoungArts program.
Sofranko wrote a first draft of the pilot, and they soon passed it on to friend and fellow USC grad Adam North. The two wrote the series over the course of a year, originally in 14 short episodes. When they planned the show, it was first organized like a feature.
“We plotted the whole thing, had flashcards, had everything play by play, then we broke that into episodes,” Fuller said.
Then came time to start production. The team used every channel they could to raise the money, including an Indiegogo campaign, private donations, sending letters to friends and family members and maxing out all the credit cards they could get their hands on.
The trio spent 24 stressful days in the summer of 2012 filming Complete Works. They all had limited film production experience and, as a result, felt overwhelmed.
“We had never done something with [just] the three of us,” Fuller said. “Or something on this scale of epic-ness.”
The production experience was nothing short of intense.
“It was amazing but insane,” Fuller said. “None of us went to school for film production, so we were learning how to make a movie as we were doing it.”
Fuller explained that each day of filming was like producing a staged theater production — they had to get the props, put up the lights, rehearse the actors, shoot the actors, put it all away and then do it all again the next day.
“Looking back I still say, ‘How did we do that?” Fuller said. “Energy that it takes to do something like that for no money for people with little experience, it was nuts.”
Luckily Fuller, Sofranko and North were able to assemble a skilled team of friends and acquaintances. Fellow USC classmates, USC professors, current USC students and other creative people all came together to create Complete Works.
“We were able to gather all these brilliant creative people who were like us, who wanted to make projects, who wanted to make things that were great,” said Fuller.
Fuller credits the script as being the hook that brought most people on board. The high-quality writing was able to speak for itself when the team searched for crew members and actors. At the end of the day, Fuller was glad they were able to find people who “were as passionate about telling the story as we were.”
Throughout production and post-production, ending up on Hulu was always in the back of Fuller’s head.
“That was our dream platform.” Fuller said. “Alex [Skinner, who plays Leo on the show] made a mockup of the Hulu website with our logo on it like a year ago, and I kept it as the background as my phone until it was a reality. It’s pretty amazing.”
To make that happen, they first sent Hulu the trailer. Intrigued, Hulu employees requested to view the entire series. Initially, the Complete Works team sent them the 14-episode version. Soon, however, they took a step back to consider the format of most shows on Hulu. Realizing they were missing something, they re-edited the show into five 30-minute episodes to better fit typical Hulu programming. Luckily, Hulu approved of the new formatting and agreed to pick up the show.
Fuller is thrilled that the show is finally premiering.
“We’re super excited because we didn’t make the show to watch it ourselves,” she said. “I’ve been watching it over and over during the last year, and I know every line, every performance, every shot. But we made it for an audience, and I’m so excited to share the work finally, this little thing we’ve been watching in a dark room for so many months.”
The team hopes the show will appeal not just to people who love theater, but people in the arts, especially students. The show is about Shakespeare and the arts, but above all, it’s about college-age students trying to find their place.
Fuller hopes her show inspires other USC students to create their own projects.
“People wouldn’t be afraid to jump in and make something,” she said. “I can’t even tell you how much we’ve learned throughout this process. I encourage everyone to do as much as you can, and put the time in, because you’ll be happier in the end.”
The show premiered on Hulu today and is  available for free. For more information, view the show’s website, completeworks.tv.

We have all heard “Animal”  and “Everybody Talks” blasting on the radio one too many times. These songs  quickly rocketed their way to the top of everyone’s “annoying, but catchy mainstream songs” mental list to never play again — ever. There are reasons that these songs are extremely popular: The American pop band Neon Trees is extremely talented, unique and diverse in repertoire. And the band’s new album, Pop Psychology, which dropped April 22, has once again proven their reputation true as an eccentric group that produces catchy music that can please almost everybody’s varying tastes.
“Maniacs,” the pet name for their fans, are used to more rock-heavy songs. But Pop Psychology will also provide a surprising showcase of a new mellow maturity that highlights how Neon Trees members have grown as musicians: less drums, more guitar, synth and vocals. This album is an overall step toward the pop and electro genres that seem to be all over the charts. Their first single released from the album, “Sleeping With a Friend,” is an  upbeat, smooth jam that will undoubtedly lift anybody’s spirits on a bad day.
Don’t worry just yet, die-hard Neon Trees fans. This is not a step toward mainstream artists such as Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. Rather, Neon Trees is still making its own unique voice outside the usual pop music driver. This album just seems to show the true colors and niche of the band: pop with many influences of electro, punk and rock. This Utah band is growing up and figuring out their sound -— and Pop Psychology is definitely a step in the right direction.
As their album name articulates, this record truly does study the varying versions of pop. It mirrors the many forms of mainstream music that people love.  Neon Trees artfully mixes different genres together to create a unique sounding record. Each song has an interesting mix of electro and acoustic music with beautiful vocals that toes the line between “hipster,” folk band and Fall Out Boy-rock. This wide array of songs could easily be played at a large dinner party with no complaints.
Similar to the fresh sound of this band, their lyrics take on the usual subjects of mainstream music but with a twist. “Love in the 21st Century” tackles dating in the technological age, “I don’t believe making out is a dead romance / I miss the days being kids we’d be holding hands / I’m sick of wondering if you would ever call me back / I check my four different accounts.” “Living in Another World” describes self-empowerment: “TVs telling me to be myself / I can’t trust what the neon psychic sells / So I found out how to trust myself / I found out that I’m stronger than the pills.” These lyrics show off the original and witty songwriting that is usually missing from today’s top hits. But they are just as easy for fans to scream at the top of their lungs.
Neon Trees has proven on this album that the band can stretch and mold its sound in many different forms. Pop Psychology has something for everyone’s taste. As a memorable pop album with a unique spin on the average hits of today, it could prove to be Neon Trees’ successful coming-of-age record; they finally found their place in the musical world, or at least came very close.
As a genre classification, this album has a distinctive enough sound to be considered indie. The band’s overall electro-pop agenda still makes it accessible to a wide audience while still appealing to that music snob who enjoys banjos in songs. So, if you like drinking out of mason jars while jamming along to Taylor Swift, this borderline hipster, pop album is for you. And it will simultaneously impress those indie friends and die-hard boy band fans.

One week from tomorrow, the Daily Trojan will print its last issue of the semester. In our first issue of the semester, we wrote that we wanted to “strive to be not just the best that we can be, but the best news source possible … And in order to do that, we need to change a bit.”
The Daily Trojan‘s redesign hopes to bring the paper into the present.
As we enter the digital age, so does the field of journalism. There’s intense competition between news sources to provide the most accurate information to the populace in a timely manner. This semester, the Daily Trojan made a pledge to revitalize our online presence to the best of our ability, and we’re proud of the result. When you pull up dailytrojan.com, you can see not just articles from our printed paper but also exclusive videos, podcasts, online-only columns and more. And last week, we participated in a social media “war” against that other school, competing to gain the most Facebook “likes” in seven days (we won, by the way).
We realize that the future of journalism is online, which is why we’ll work ardently over the summer and into the fall semester to create the best possible website we can. But we would be remiss not to discuss how much print journalism still means to us and how important it is for the industry as a whole. Though the Internet is very much our present as well as the future, there is nothing quite like holding a newspaper in your hand and letting your fingers smudge the ink on a page.
That is why the Daily Trojan decided it was time for a redesign. Working away in our offices for hours has obviously made us a bit biased, but we believe that the printed newspaper is too valuable of a resource, too necessary of a tradition to let it slip away into the past. By modernizing and updating our design, we’re ready to bring the Daily Trojan into the present.
We hope that you find the redesign as thrilling as we do. We welcome any feedback you have. Email us at letters@dailytrojan.com.

Suspension. It has to be one of the scariest words a student can hear, right next to expulsion, that is. A suspension is usually handed down after a student has violated school code and possibly put his or her peers in danger, therefore leading to that student being temporarily prohibited from school grounds and classes. In the past week, however, some school administrators have threatened suspension not for the best interest of the student body, but to seemingly silence students from exposing a point of view they disagree with. In an age when one’s school record is vital to success and his or her opinions are protected by law, school administrators should not misuse the act of suspension by using it as a threat to make students fall back in line.
When a group of 18 students from the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation occupied USC’s Bovard Auditorium on April 15 to shed light on workers’ rights and the university’s relationship with a vendor — the parent company of which has ties to factories in Bangladesh and who SCALE claims has contributed to the death of numerous workers — the administration’s response was to claim that students would be given a letter of “interim suspension.”
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that no letters of interim suspension were handed out and the students were informed of the possibility of suspension prior to the beginning of their sit-in. Furthermore, he added that if students were suspended they “would likely face the loss of any university scholarships.” For a university where tuition costs $42,602 a year, according to the USC Financial Aid website, the possibility of receiving a suspension and losing one’s scholarship is a steep punishment.
Yes, schools have to maintain a sense of decorum and standards for student conduct, but suspension should not be used as a way to stifle the student voice. Students have rights, as was seen in the case of Tinker v. Des Moines, in which the Supreme Court ruled that students have certain constitutional rights and that disciplinary actions by the school should not violate these rights. Though the ruling applied to public schools, private schools should have the same regard for students’ rights.
A few days after students were threatened with suspension and loss of scholarship because of their sit-in here in Los Angeles, a high school senior in Pennsylvania was suspended for asking Miss America Nina Davuluri to his prom, according to New York Magazine. Central York High School administrators, according to the Associated Press, said they were tasked with keeping the rest of the school’s teenage students in order and had warned the now-suspended Patrick Farves of the possible consequences before he conducted his “promposal.” Despite pleas from Miss America to the administration to reconsider their punishment of Farves, the school stood by its decision to give Farves a three-day in-school suspension for asking Miss America to prom against the administration’s wishes.
Over the years, the number of students who have been suspended in the United States has risen. According to the U.S. Department of Education, more than 3.7 million students received out-of-school suspensions in the 2009-2010 school year. Therefore, one out of every nine secondary school students was suspended at least once during that year. Once a suspension is on a student’s record, it stays there. Though the record can become private, the stigma surrounding suspension remains.
During the formative years of high school and college, a student should not be penalized for forming beliefs, standing by them and letting other people know how he or she feels. Students in high school and college should be able to use this time in their lives to explore their ideas and find unique ways to express them. When the administration uses suspension as a way to seemingly stifle the dissenting focus on an issue that has larger social implications rather than using it to remove a bad apple from the crowd, then suspension is not being used correctly. Instead, it is being used as a political tool — and students don’t have an equal one to pry back with.
When students come to the administration with their concerns, they should not be met with stringent punishments, but instead with an open dialogue to discuss why these grievances have been made, and possibly clarify any misunderstandings surrounding concerns of workers’ rights over in Bangladesh. Furthermore, if students are consistently threatened with suspension over seemingly non-harmful crimes, such as sitting in the hallways of the administrative building and asking one of the nation’s prettiest women to prom, then when suspension is actually needed to curb a student’s actions it will not have the same effect. It will not be taken as seriously and threats of suspension will fall on deaf ears. We should reserve suspension for the real crimes and wrongdoings that students could possibly do.
Suspension is a scary action. Yet high school and college students, particularly here at USC, should not feel like inaction on the issues that matter should be the way to prevent suspension. Therefore, high school and colleges administrators across the nation should be wary of threatening to suspend their students. Rather, they should sit and listen to what the students have to say before we decide to kick them out of school for three days. Suspension is meant to discipline, and we should be cautious of enforcing such discipline on students for simply holding opinions on social justice.

It’s hardest to describe a cultural phenomenon from the very middle of its trajectory. Not enough time has passed for hindsight to accurately characterize its origins, and its future remains distressingly uncertain, particularly for its primary stakeholders.
The rapper Lil Dicky finds himself in just such a position at the moment; profoundly validated by his present internet celebrity, while simultaneously anxious and supremely confident about his future. Our collective cultural consciousness is so obsessed with celebrity, that the process “making it,” particularly in retrospect, is often characterized as a mythical hero’s journey. But for Lil Dicky, who is so unequivocally in the middle of that journey, it feels nothing like an E! News documentary.
His experience demonstrates the importance of extreme self-awareness, and the sometimes incongruous combination of marketing savvy and artistic acumen that goes into the creation of a star. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Lil Dicky laid out his specific strategies for achieving pop-icon status.
Don’t be just one thing.
Lil Dicky rose to YouTube fame over the past year with his hilarious rap videos, particularly “White Dude” and “Ex Boyfriend,” but even in just his two most successful videos, there is an impressive diversity of themes.

“White Dude” can best be described as a South Park style political satire, while “Ex Boyfriend” is a crass examination of male self-consciousness. Some of his newest songs, like “Make Belief” and “Russell Westbrook on a Farm” are much more introspective than they are funny.
Additionally, Lil Dicky has been approached by TV networks about creating a TV show at least partially inspired by his rise to fame. He’s hitting his fans with a wide variety of content on different platforms with a little self-reflexivity thrown in.
Do something no one has ever done.
Lil Dicky’s multi-medium approach is indicative of the fact that he is striving to carve out his own niche for himself. As he said in his interview with the Daily Trojan, no one has ever done what he is attempting: make verbally sophisticated comedy rap that also provides an enjoyable musical experience. Lil Dicky also sets himself apart by his general disregard for both political correctness and the conventions of the rap genre.
Embody the way your fan base experiences the world.
These days, it can be very difficult to determine whether a cultural artifact is critiquing or celebrating the phenomena it depicts. The Wolf of Wall Street or Kanye West’s “Yeezus” both perfectly embody this trend. This ambiguity in our great works of pop culture mirrors generational preferences for irony and contradiction. “White Dude,” like the works mentioned above, captures those sensibilities, and applies them to a topic very few are willing to satirize.
Emulate (but don’t copy) tried and true formulas.
Larry David, the creators of South Park and generations of comics before them have proven that people want to see unfiltered critiques on the absurdity of contemporary life, no matter how uncomfortable or “offensive” they might be.
The success of HBO’s Girls has similarly demonstrated that there is a high demand for media that captures the millennial experience. Lil Dicky channels both of these models in his work, but with his own personal twist.
Lil Dicky is doing all of this on his own. This portion of his career is exclusively being financed by his Kickstarter campaign, which raised just over $100,000. He seems to be doing just fine without the expensive corporate machinery that helped create many of our favorite popstars. Like a shrewd businessman, Lil Dicky sees a cultural need, and he intends to fill it as an artist. Let’s see how well we respond.
