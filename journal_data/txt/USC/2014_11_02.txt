The results of a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll released this weekend revealed public opinion on the race for State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the race for governor, and ballot propositions, as well as the public’s thoughts on the state’s high-speed rail project, plastic grocery bag ban and Ebola.
According to poll results, education has surpassed the economy as a top priority among California voters. Forty-two percent of likely voters rated education as their most important issue. Thirty-seven percent of likely voters said that the economy was their number one concern, followed by water and drought issues (27 percent), crime and public safety (16 percent), taxes (17 percent) and the state budget deficit (13 percent), a press release stated.
This divide might be a contributing factor in the tight race for State Superintendent. Poll results showed that incumbent Tom Torlakson leads over opponent Marshall Tuck by a slim margin of 32 to 29 percent among likely voters, according to a Dornsife press release.
“I can’t think of a down-ticket office in recent California history that’s received so much attention,” said Dan Schnur, director of the poll and executive director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, in the press release. “Some of that is the relative lack of competition at the top of the ballot, some of it is lack of extremely compelling ballot initiatives, but a lot of it is the emergence of education as such a top-tier issue for California voters.”
In the race for governor, 56 percent of registered likely voters said they would cast their ballot for incumbent Jerry Brown, while 37 percent support Republican businessman Neel Kashkari, results showed. Likely voters also strongly support the propositions supported by Brown, such as Propositions 1 and 2 as well as Proposition 47.
Proposition 1 allows the state to spend more money on water-related programs, and Proposition 2 increases California’s rainy-day fund while also requiring more regular payment of state debt. Proposition 47 allows misdemeanor instead of felony sentencing for some drug- and property-related offenses.
The majority of likely voters oppose Propositions 45 and 46, which give the state more control over health insurance rates and increase the cap for damages in medical malpractice suits, respectively.
“Propositions 1, 2 and 47 are facing little or no financial opposition, while the campaigns for Propositions 45 and 46 are being heavily outspent,” Schnur said in a press release.
Meanwhile, voters were divided about California’s potential high-speed rail line. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the project should stop compared to the 44 percent who wanted it to proceed. In contrast, the September 2013 poll showed less support, with 43 percent of voters in favor of the project and 52 percent opposed.
Participants were also polled on their concern about Ebola and the state’s plastic grocery bag ban. Most respondents said they were not concerned about exposure to the Ebola virus, with 46 percent of California voters saying they are “not at all worried” that they or a family member will be exposed to Ebola and 24 percent saying that they are not “too worried.”
Furthermore, California voters support the recent statewide ban on plastic grocery bags in a margin of about 2-to-1, according to the poll.

Dillon Connolly, who was captain of the men’s swimming team in 2011 and set school records in the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke during his time at USC, is on the road to recovery after suffering injuries to his spinal cord in a diving accident in Newport Beach on Sept. 13.

Connolly was swimming in Newport Beach and dove into what he thought was open water, but was actually a sandbar. The shallow dive caused Connolly to injure his neck and spine.
After the accident, friends and family raised more than $50,000 for his recovery. Connolly, who graduated in 2011 with a degree in industrial and systems engineering, has made progress from initial full body paralysis.
Connolly entered USC as the top recruited swimmer for the USC men’s swimming team. Before coming to USC, Connolly became an Olympic Trials qualifier in both the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke.
“Dillon was always willing to put in the extra bit as captain,” said Patrick White, Connolly’s teammate and USC alumnus. “He never asked anyone to work harder than he did because no one worked harder than he did.”
White said Connolly went above and beyond in his dedication to the swim team.
“After we’d get out of four hours of practice and everyone was getting up from the pool deck, Dillon would be over on the other side of the pool doing ab workouts with the Olympians while we were all just dragging ourselves off the pool,” White said.
On Sept. 13, Connolly was pulled out of the water in Newport Beach and taken to the hospital for spinal cord injuries. White said that injury was severe from the beginning.
“One of the Newport Beach life [life]guards, who is my friend, said that they pulled a guy out of the water and that he didn’t have any mobility from his neck down,” said White. “Then an hour later I found out it was Dillon, my friend.”
Connolly went into surgery following the injury. White said that Connolly was diagnosed as an A on the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, which ranks injuries from most severe to least severe by assigning letters A-E. Connolly’s injuries were classified as most severe, indicating no movement from the nipple line down and no motor or sensory functions. The surgery led to improved motor functions.
“At that point there were questions of whether he would survive or not,” White said.
Julia Connolly, Dillon’s mother, maintains a blog chronicling her son’s progress since the accident. She explained Dillon’s recovery in an Oct. 23 post.
“In addition to his incredible attitude, Dillon continues to make remarkable improvements. He astonished us a couple of nights ago by raising his forearm off of the bed to show me where to massage the knot out of his shoulder,” Julia Connolly wrote in a CaringBridge.org post. “Dillon also graduated from driving his chair with a ‘sip and puff’ straw to using a goal-post style hand drive and he drove his chair all the way down to the radiology department.”
Since then, Connolly has undergone several other procedures, and his family is hoping he will soon be able to begin the rehabilitation process once he is healed from the surgeries. The family, who lives in Georgia, hopes to relocate to California, where Dillon currently lives.
Connolly has had a network of support through social media. Connolly’s former housemate, James Kashyap, and teammates created a fundraiser on the free crowdfunding website GoFundMe.com to help the Connolly family pay for Dillon’s medical expenses.
“When James [Kashyap] first started that campaign he didn’t expect to get that much,” White said. “His first goal was $5,000 and now it is up to $53,000 dollars and this will start to be what his family will need in the long run.”
So far, 370 donations to the GoFundMe.com page have resulted in a total of $54,215 in funds raised. White said the fundraising is about helping the family avoid incurring such high costs to take care of Connolly.
“We are hoping to prevent the family from having to sell any of their own assets and make sure he has the best care he can possibly get,” White said.
White said that Connolly’s family has played a key role in his optimism.
“He got his positivity from his parents,” White said. “The last time I was in there, he was telling us about the engineering projects he had been working on and asking all of us about our work too. It was really nice to have conversations like that again.”

A fire at Tuscany Apartments early Saturday morning caused significant property damage and left some residents unable to return home.
Emergency · A fire at Tuscany Apartments (above) early Saturday morning forced some residents to vacate their apartments due to damage. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
“We received a 911 call at 4:58 a.m. and when firefighters arrived on scene they described what they had was a small roof fire,” said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott.
Scott said it took 12 firefighters approximately one hour to extinguish the fire. To do so, residents said the fire department punched holes through the roof and into two of the fifth-floor apartments to drain the water from the hoses.
Abdullah Bundogji, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering who lives in one of those apartments, said that the rug in his apartment and much of his bathroom were destroyed. Bundogji and his roommate moved into a room at the Radisson Hotel Los Angeles midtown at USC Saturday afternoon.
“All my clothes smell like smoke now,” Bundogji said. “I have three midterms this week, so moving over the weekend when I really need to study honestly just sucks and moving back is probably going to be even worse.”
Bundogji said he is unsure when he will be able to return to his apartment.
“I’m hearing three days, but one of the construction workers said it could take a lot longer because they have to dislodge a lot of drywall. In the bathroom there’s a lot of repairs and demolition,” Bundogji said.
Scott said the official cause of the fire remains under investigation. Residents believe it might have started from the barbecue gas line and spread because there was flammable material in the trash can next to the barbecue.No injuries were reported.
Bundogji said the majority of the damage was to his apartment and an apartment down the hall. Most residents, including Victoria Schwartz, a sophomore industrial engineering major who also lives on the fifth floor, were able to return to their apartments later on Saturday morning.
“They would not let me in afterward because of smoke,” Schwartz said. “They let me in at 7 a.m. But it’s over, and nothing happened to me thankfully.”

USC alumnus Nate Kaplan is educating voters this midterm election with SeePolitical, an organization he founded with the goal of creating clear and entertaining videos to explain ballot propositions for voters. On Tuesday, Kaplan expects to see the impact SeePolitical has had in the form of increased voter turnout.

“We’re very firm in our belief that we’ll have more educated voters at the ballot,” Kaplan said. “Studies show that the more that a population knows about an issue, the more likely they are to vote, so there’s a direct correlation there.”
SeePolitical’s main goal is accessibility for all voters, which is why their videos are available in both English and Spanish. Their explanations are also very brief and are given in simple terms rather than the more complex legal language often seen in other voter guides. This simplicity, employees hope, will make viewers feel more confident in making political choices and in encouraging them to vote.
“One of the biggest complaints that we hear about the ballot process is how complicated some of these issues can be, so the real added value of a project like SeePolitical is to present the information in an unbiased way but in a much more accessible way as well,” said Dan Schnur, executive director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and a SeePolitical board member.
SeePolitical is not necessarily aimed at only college students and young voters, and its founders describe the service as “a voter tool for the modern lifestyle.” Employees are confident in young voters’ desire and ability to participate politically. SeePolitical wants their organization’s videos to assist them in making informed decisions.
“It’s easy for older people to dismiss young people as not caring about politics, but what my time at campus has taught me is that students are not uncaring, they’re not unintelligent, but they’re very, very busy,” Schnur said. “So finding a way to engage their attention in a respectful rather than a condescending way is a really important thing to what we do.”
College students are also involved behind the scenes of SeePolitical. Students from Otis College of Art and Design create the animations, and SeePolitical employees, including interns from USC, work on content.
“It’s easy to be a college-aged kid and be cynical about America and politicians, but I think that the fact that we’re using college kids to help push us forward and that we have such a creative say in marketing and advertising that it’s going to reach out to a younger crowd to get involved,” said Ryan Bernstein, a SeePolitical intern and junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law.
Besides educating voters about propositions, SeePolitical employees also believe that discussing the benefits of voting, such as changes in the community, can help encourage more people to vote.
“Telling a young person you should vote because it’s important is not a particularly compelling argument,” Schnur said. “To tell them to vote to better public schools, to create higher paying jobs or to protect public safety is more likely to get their attention.”
Multiple SeePolitical videos have been viewed more than 1,000 times, and the organization has received requests from different communities to include translations to other languages, which will happen soon, Kaplan says. The videos have also recently been featured on ABC news channels in California. The organization hopes its recent success will lead to further growth.
“Our demand is growing, which we’re really happy to say,” Kaplan said. “We want to start doing it in other states next year, we want to host official candidate statements on our platform, and by 2016, we hope to be in every U.S. household.”

From Oct. 24 through Nov. 21, Sanrio’s favorite cartoon cat is leading a foodie-themed scavenger hunt across Los Angeles. In honor of Hello Kitty’s 40th anniversary, local eateries are offering limited edition kitty-themed dishes and collectible pins. Kitty fans can munch their way through the city, enjoying Japanese fare, American dishes and cute desserts. The Hungry Hunt embodies Sanrio’s “Small Gift, Big Smile” philosophy: Hello Kitty brings happiness wherever she goes.
Participating restaurants include Downtown eateries and locations in Little Tokyo as well as restaurants in Sawtelle, West Hollywood and at The Original Farmer’s Market at The Grove. Downtown restaurants include Plan Check Kitchen + Bar and Lemonade.
Lemonade is offering a special Hello Kitty Lemonade and giving away pins with Hello Kitty holding their signature beverage. Executive Chef Ernesto Uchimura, from Plan Check Kitchen + Bar, created a special Hello Kitty Bento Box, with a burger with pink cheese, fries, spicy tuna salad, a chilled green tea latte and strawberry cruller donuts with ice cream.
Café Dulce and Xlixe Pizzeria in Little Tokyo and Zip Sushi & Izakaya in the Little Tokyo Arts District will also be participating in Hello Kitty’s Hungry Hunt. Café Dulce is preparing a special Hello Kitty donut and Xlixe Pizzeria is crafting a limited edition pizza. The Chado Tea Room, located in the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, is offering a special blend of Hello Kitty tea and a scone. The Hello Kitty retrospective is held at the same location.
Ace of Cakes star Duff Goldman’s Charm City Cakes West in West Hollywood is offering a custom designed Hello Kitty cupcake — their pin features Hello Kitty with a slice of cake. Dylan’s Candy Bar at the Original Farmer’s Market at The Grove will compile an adorable Hello Kitty sundae for the Hungry Hunt using their ample supply of colorful sweets.
In Sawtelle, kitty fans can enjoy Hello Kitty ramen at Daikokuya, an authentic Japanese ramen bar, or a Korean barbecue-inspired sausage from Seoul Sausage Co. The Seoul Sausage food truck won the third season of Food Network’s The Great Food Truck Race and has expanded to a brick and mortar location. Lollicup Coffee & Tea has a special Hello Kitty boba drink — tea with milk and tapioca pearls — and a collectible pin with Hello Kitty and a boba tea at their Sawtelle location.
The Hungry Hunt is just one part of the month-long festivities. Los Angeles is hosting the first Hello Kitty fan convention at MOCA/The Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art. This exhaustive Hello Kitty extravaganza lasted from Oct. 30 through Nov. 2 and included exclusive access to Hello Kitty’s super cute world. The convention featured kitty-inspired fashion, art exhibitions and food. There was also a life-sized Hello Kitty home  and exclusive merchandise from Sanrio’s partners. Guests could choose to attend lectures and workshops, such as Hello Kitty flower arranging, and kitty super fans could visit the Hello Kitty tattoo parlor. In a press statement, Sanrio describes the event as the ultimate Hello Kitty experience, “This milestone event will place Hello Kitty fans at the center of the ultimate interactive experience, inviting them to immerse themselves in a never-before-seen environment where the world of Hello Kitty is celebrated, explored and experienced.”
The nearby Japanese American National Museum is also curating the first Hello Kitty retrospective, entitled “Hello! Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty.” This exhibition runs from Oct. 11 through April 26 and explores the cat’s impact on contemporary art and culture. Visitors who purchased Hello Kitty Convention tickets had free same-day access to the museum exhibition.
In addition to Los Angeles-based festivities, Sanrio launched Hello Kitty’s Global Hug campaign to promote the cat’s friendly nature — as Hello Kitty says, “You can never have too many friends.” This campaign promotes the cartoon cat’s ambassadorial qualities, she has become a pop culture icon, and many consumers associate her with Japanese culture and society. As Sanrio explained in a press statement, “This unique initiative is geared toward honoring and celebrating the ever-loyal and beloved Hello Kitty fans, while promoting the company philosophy of friendship, happiness and community.” The Global Hug Report tallies the hugs Hello Kitty gives during her global tour and guest appearances, updates can be viewed on Hello Kitty’s social media channels, #HelloKittyHugs.
The cat’s 40th anniversary promises to be one of the biggest character-centric celebrations in Los Angeles. In a press statement, Sanrio’s Chief Operating Officer and President Janet Hsu explained that the festivities aim to connect with and thank Hello Kitty’s fans for their loyalty.

Over Halloween weekend, more than 90,000 people stormed the Pomona Fairplex for the annual HARD Day of the Dead music festival. With a massive lineup curated by HARD founder and CEO Gary Richards, better known by his stage name Destructo, the festival this year promised acts from big names like Knife Party, Diplo and Zedd, along with noteworthy emerging artists.
 
The Fairplex was the perfect venue for the weekend. Located in Pomona, it is conveniently reachable from all locations in Southern California and is large enough to cater to the size of HARD’s crowd. Entering the festival, attendees had the option of riding a zip line into the arena, flying over thousands of screaming fans before landing in the center of the Fairplex.
Out of the five stages, the HARD stage was always the most crowded, teeming with festival goers at all hours of the day. Located in the center of the venue, it hosted Knife Party, Pretty Lights, GTA and Seven Lions and others on the first day.
At 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, Salva took to the stage, energizing fans with an extensive amount of mainstream trap, as well as some new original mix tapes. His most popular song, “Drop that B-tch,” showcased hip-hop influences with heavy bass meshed with electronic and techno sound bits. The crowd jumped along to the thudding bass and cheered as the drop hit, waving their arms to the beat. Only two hours in, and HARD’s audience’s energy was electric and contagious.
The most surprising performance was by Seven Lions, who blew the crowd away with his remixes. A Billboard alum, the American drummer-turned-DJ-producer, delivered renditions of top chart hits, such as Bastille’s “Pompeii,” and his own compositions “Strangers” and “Days to Come.” His fast-paced set at 4:30 p.m. on the main stage juxtaposed Salva’s earlier set and made apparent the diversity of performers at HARD this year.
GTA was the next group following Seven Lions and Salva. The group relied on sharp and staccato electronic dance music. Afterwards, Pretty Lights stayed true to his name, providing the audience with some of the best visuals in the electronic music scene today.
Diplo and Knife Party closed the HARD stage Saturday night. Similar to his performance at USC’s Springfest last year, Diplo supplied his audience with a dynamic and vibrant set of mixes. He demonstrated his production prowess by throwing out tracks from his previous collaborations with Skrillex, including “Jack U,” and signature tracks such as “Boy Oh Boy” and “Revolution.” Diplo proved to be a crowd favorite.
The night ended with Knife Party. He opened with the “biggest pre-album listening session ever,” according to their frontman Rob Swire. They debuted their upcoming album, Abandon Ship, to thunderous applause and cheers and a cascade of fireworks to end the first of two very eventful nights. The crowd still had energy; even after 10 hours of dancing, partying and cheering, HARD festival goers were all smiling, Instagramming and tweeting their favorite moments with the hashtag #HARDDOTD2014.
Sunday’s lineup was just as promising. HARD’s founder Destructo spun on the main stage early in the evening, followed by Zedd and Calvin Harris. Meanwhile, the smaller stages — HARDer, Purple Stage, Pink Stage and 7UP Green — hosted Bassnectar, Zeds Dead, Shift K3y and other emerging artists.
All in all, HARD Day of the Dead 2014 delivered on everything it was advertised to be — a big festival that featured a diverse and talented group of artists. Veterans of the festival were not disappointed, and newcomers became die-HARD fans.

Comic book conventions have exploded in popularity in recent years. Box offices are dominated by superhero, sci-fi and fantasy films, and it’s a good time to be a nerd. With superbeings and spaceships flying around onscreen, many casual fans who would not have been able to tell a Loki from a Lannister a few years ago are now well versed in all things geek. This has caused interest in conventions, where fans can unabashedly show their love for these characters, to skyrocket. Stan Lee’s Comikaze, which was put on just a short way from USC’s campus at the Los Angeles Convention Center this past weekend, is a shining example of what one of these conventions can be.
Major turnout · Thousands of excited fans flocked to fill the cavernous main hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center. Rows upon rows of stands provided a maze for the many patrons to wander for hours. – Photo courtesy of Comikaze
 
Upon entering the convention center, the first thing that jumps out is the kaleidoscope of costumes. After spending any amount of time in the convention center’s halls, it becomes clear that despite the wide array of panels, celebrity guests and exhibits, these costumes, or “cosplays” (a portmanteau of “costume play”) as they are often known in the fandom and convention circuits, are the true lifeblood of the convention. The sheer amount of time and effort that clearly went into these homemade cosplays is worth the price of admission by itself. The best cosplayers are essentially walking museum exhibits, stopping every few minutes to take pictures with awestruck fans and covering seemingly every corner of the pop culture universe. They range from hyper-realistic reproductions to interesting remixes on iconic characters. One of the more popular cosplayers on the floor was a woman dressed as Snow White in full Boba Fett-style Mandalorian armor. She was treated like an A-list celebrity, attracting a circle of fans taking pictures on their phones. Another cosplayer was dressed in Stormtrooper armor decorated like an ’80s B-boy tracksuit. At least 10 different incarnations of the Guardians of the Galaxy wandered the floor, ranging from the base-level store-bought fare to a Groot costume that left bystanders unconvinced that he was not actually the 10-foot-tall living tree from Planet X.
The parade of cosplayers culminated in a large costume contest on the convention’s main stage early Saturday evening. Cosplayers were judged in solo and group categories. The contest was apparently open to anyone, as it was clear that not all the entrants were in the same league. Some of the costumes were blatantly store-bought. Despite this, the highlights were extremely strong. There was a Maleficent (possibly the most popular cosplay of the exposition) with fully functional mechanical wings that drew an audible gasp from the audience. The showstopper, however, was a Big Daddy costume from the video game BioShock that had such an incredible level of detail that it blew the rest of the contestants away, taking home the $3,500 first prize.
Aside from watching the cosplayers strut their stuff, the convention’s many other attractions provided plenty of entertainment. There was a stable of celebrities available for autographs and photos. Stan Lee was one of the guests of honor in his own exposition, but Gwendoline Christie and Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones were also big draws, as were John Barrowman of Doctor Who fame and Jewel Staite from Firefly. Adam West was also scheduled to appear but illness didn’t allow him to show up, leading to Burt Ward, the Robin to West’s Batman, to take his place. Meeting the guests required steep fees, however, which reduced the lines significantly. This left the celebrities as little more than high-profile decorations lining the back walls of the main hall for the majority of patrons not willing to dish out $50 or more to briefly meet the actors.
The marketplace occupying the majority of the space in the main hall was much more active, and the variety of items available for purchase was very impressive. One specialized stand was selling only Mandalorian armor; another specialized in recreations of fictional weapons. There were many T-shirt, action figure and poster stands peppering the landscape. There were also many stands in which lesser-known pop culture figures were present to interact with fans. These setups were much more rewarding than the ones for the higher-profile celebrities, since even if someone didn’t purchase an autograph or photo, one could still interact with them. The highlights among these were Tommy Wiseau of The Room fame and the brains behind Cracked.com.
The exhibits were also interesting, as there was a Back to the Future DeLorean and a Jurassic Park Jeep available for pictures. Having recently had a DeLorean visit the USC campus, these exhibits were not as exciting for a USC student as they would have been for the average expo-goer.
Two glaring weak points of the exposition were the food and seating areas. The food available in the convention was a downright embarrassment, as the $11.50 burgers tasted like cardboard. And once the burgers were purchased, the seating area was a significant distance away, causing an awkward walk through the bustling main hall while trying to carry purchased food. The convention’s saving grace was a few quality food trucks parked outside, but they were not well-publicized and could have been easily missed by a patron who used a different entrance. A little bit of effort on food options could have gone a long way, as the rest of the event was extremely strong. But considering that this was only Comikaze’s fourth year, it is still growing and has room to improve on its weaknesses to become an exposition to be reckoned with.

The USC men’s tennis team sent in a contingent of players to the 2014 US Tennis Association Collegiate Clay Court Invitational in Orlando, Florida this weekend, with Trojan sophomore Nick Crystal placing highest on the team as the tournament’s runner-up.
The final match saw Crystal ultimately unable to overcome No. 1 seed Hunter Harrington of Clemson. Harrington dispatched Crystal in two sets to claim the USTA Collegiate Clay Court Invitational crown, 6-2, 6-3. USC head coach Peter Smith cited a rule change made by the NCAA Division I Men’s and Women’s Tennis committee for no-ad scoring, meaning that on deuce points where games are tied 40-40, the next player to score wins the game.
“[Harrington] played great and Nick lost three deuce points. We’re using no ad scoring now and Nick barely lost those points,” Smith said. “Nick played a great match, but to Harrington’s credit, he never let Nick into the match.”
Crystal, who finished last season ranked No. 85 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s  rankings, was unranked in this season’s preseason rankings. The former No. 1 college tennis recruit in New York, according to TennisRecruiting.net, began his campaign for the clay court title by defeating Virginia Tech’s Florian Nicourd in the opening round. Smith credited Crystal’s improvements and receptiveness to changes in his game, in addition to a comfort level on the slower clay courts, for Crystal’s success at this year’s tournament.
“I think [Crystal] knows how to move really well on clay, but I think he would have done just as well on a hard court,” Smith said. “We talked to him about making some changes in his game and he implemented those changes. We changed [Crystal’s] grips, backhand, volley and forehand strokes. We made some tweaks to a lot of areas of his game.”
Crystal went on to defeat Marco Nunez of Florida State in the next round and Columbia University’s Mike Vermeer, the No. 6 seed in the tournament, en route to a quarterfinal berth against No. 2 seed and USC teammate junior Max de Vroome.
In a match that went to two tiebreaks, Crystal overcame de Vroome 7-6(5), 7-6(3) to earn him a semifinal tilt with Auburn’s Max Hinnisdaels, whom the Waccabuc, New York native defeated 6-2, 1-6, 6-3.
In individual tournaments, players on USC’s team can — and often do — run into each other in the draw. Smith saw the match between de Vroome and Crystal as a positive development that helps his team improve, also noting that such incidents mean that both players had been successful in the tournament individually.
USC senior Roberto Quiroz, the two-time defending champion of the tournament, didn’t play there this year. When asked about Quiroz’s absence, Smith joked that Quiroz had been barred due to winning the tournament two years in a row.
“All the coaches got together and they barred Roberto from playing,” joked Smith with a deadpan. “Roberto hasn’t played a ton this fall, which I would have liked to see him do a little bit more. But he couldn’t make the trip because he’s going New York next week to play doubles with [USC senior] Yannick Hanfmann. It’s a tough back-to-back trip and he’s got to take care of his school work.”
Hanfmann and Quiroz will begin play at the ITA National Indoor Championships in Flushing Meadows, New York on Nov. 6.

There is nothing quite like a trip to Pullman, Washington to remind you of the stuff that makes college football special. Sometimes, all it takes is a visit to the most remote locale in the Pac-12 to rediscover the real spirit of the game.
USC’s matchup against Washington State on Saturday wasn’t anything spectacular. The Trojans played a solid game on both sides of the ball, decisively beating an inferior team. The Trojans came out a bit sloppy, but overall performed admirably. In less-than-stellar weather conditions, they stretched the field vertically and connected on explosive plays.
More impressive than all of that though, was the simple fact that USC came out and dominated the game from start to finish. Coming off a tough loss to Utah, the Trojans could have folded. Instead, they came out energized and focused. There is something to be said about the mental toughness of the players to avoid the letdown and keep their slim but existent dreams for a Pac-12 South title alive.
Though all of that speaks to the character of this Trojan squad, for the most part the game was nondescript. Yet even in the mundane there were moments to be treasured. It started in the aftermath of a gruesome leg injury to Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday. As he was being lifted onto the stretcher, USC’s redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler and senior linebacker Hayes Pullard came on to the field to offer a measure of comfort to a clearly agonized Halliday.
It’s moments like those that put the game into perspective. Halliday’s career most likely ended on that play. As a senior with low draft prospects, Halliday experienced quite possibly the worst way to end one’s career. With the distractions of the game swirling around, Kessler still had the presence of mind to recognize this and go over to a fellow Pac-12 quarterback. I don’t think there are that many players in college football who would have done that.
That type of sportsmanship is something often overlooked in the heat of battle. With the commercialization college ball, we as fans are so focused on the playoff and the play calling that we all sometimes forget that at the end of the day it’s just college kids out on the field having fun. I’m as guilty of this as anyone, taking the game of football for granted as a fan. Sometimes, it’s moments like those that demonstrate the true nature of the game.
The weekend in Pullman was full of them. Washington State hasn’t been truly relevant since the turn of the century. Yet, even with temperatures falling to the mid-40s and a decent amount of rain falling, fans made the trek from all across the state to watch the Cougars. That dedication is pretty incredible. Comparatively it makes rooting for USC, which at times can seem ulcer-inducing, seem like a pretty sweet gig.
In the heart of Los Angeles, with rare or non-existent bad weather, USC game days are always phenomenal. No matter who the opponent is, there is a good chance that USC will come away with the victory. This healthy dose of optimism around the program is something not felt in Pullman. It’s probably not felt at hundreds of schools around the country, and until you’re exposed to it, it’s hard to fathom how that is even a possibility.
This season for USC probably won’t end in roses, and that qualifies as a disappointment for many fans, especially when the team has been so close in its losses. Yet for some teams, the mere thought of the Rose Bowl and national contention would qualify as a tremendously successful season.
Just like everything else, being a fan is relative. USC is accustomed to success on the gridiron. They don’t call us “Arrogant Nation” because of modest expectations. So it probably doesn’t make sense to compare our situation to that of Washington State’s fan base. Even so, it’s a nice reminder every once in a while that things could be much, much worse.
After the sanctions and the coaching changes and all the drama, USC is still a pretty good football team. A team that is not elite, not yet anyway, but still solid with a chance to win every game. A team led by a rapidly developing quarterback, who is also a great leader and competitor. A team filled with young talent at every position with its best days ahead of them.
Memories fade, and this feeling will dissipate fairly quickly if USC can’t beat UCLA or Notre Dame. Even so, it’s nice to be reminded sometimes of what makes college football count. The character of the players and the enduring belief that your team has a good chance to win any game it plays are often overlooked as Trojan fans. Yet, that’s what really makes the rooting experience great. Sometimes, all that it takes is a trip to Pullman to remember that.

The No. 21 men’s golf team and the No. 3 women’s golf team both have big tournaments this week as they look to add on to their tournament success. The men are headed to San Martin, California to compete at the Gifford Collegiate Championship, while the women will be in Hawaii for the Pac-12 Preview. The men have finished in the top-two three times in their four events and the women are looking to win their third straight first-place finish.

The women won the Pac-12 Preview last year, an event in which every Pac-12 team and Hawai’i compete in a two-day tournament. The Women of Troy will use their fourth different lineup in their fourth event of the year with two-time All-American juniors Annie Park and Kyung Kim, All-American sophomore Karen Chung, sophomore Gabriella Then and junior transfer Elizabeth Doty.
Park’s win at the Windy City Collegiate Classic earlier this year was the sixth of her USC career, setting a new school record for career wins. Park has also qualified for the final stage of the LPGA “Q” School which will take place Dec. 3-7 at the LPGA International G.C. She tied for third at the Stage II event and was the only player in Stage II to finish under-par in all four rounds. Park and fellow All-American Kim are tied for second on USC’s career list for rounds in the 60s with 18 each, only four back of the all-time record.
The women’s team had nine wins last season which was two better than the previous school record of seven, set in the 2012-2013 season.
The men’s team will compete against UCLA, Colorado, Lamar, Northwestern, Stanford, South Florida, SMU, Texas and Wisconsin on the par-71 course in the three-day tournament. The Trojans return three starters from last year’s group that made it to the final round of the NCAA Championship for the eighth year in a row. The three returners are sophomore Rico Hoey, and seniors Paul Smith and Eric Sugimoto.
After four events, freshman Sean Crocker leads the men in stroke average and rounds in the 60s. Crocker has a pair of top-four finishes in the fall tournaments including a second-place tie at the Southwestern Intercollegiate. Hoey is second on the team in both stroke average and rounds in the 60s followed by freshman Jonah Texeira,75 who is third on the team in both categories. Hoey also has a couple of top-three finishes including a second-place finish at the Bill Cullum Invitational. Texeira has two top-10 finishes so far including a third-place finish at the Bill Cullum Invitational.
The Gifford Collegiate Championship runs from Nov. 3-5 while the Pac-12 preview kicks off on the Nov. 3 and finishes the next day. The results from both events can be followed on Golfstat.com.

The Trojan football team was singing in the rain on Saturday afternoon, pouncing early and taking advantage of its opportunities on its way to a 44-17 win over the Washington State Cougars.

USC (6-3, 5-2 Pac-12) is now 3-0 following losses this season, which USC head coach Steve Sarkisian lauded his team for.
“I don’t know how many teams get faced with some of the adversity that we’ve been faced with, in some of these gut-wrenching losses, like we had last week [at Utah],” Sarkisian said. “The thing that impresses me the most is the way that these guys continue to come right back to work, take the tough coaching, practice their tails off, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and play with amazing effort.”
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, junior wideout  Nelson Agholor and freshman wideout JuJu Smith got right back to work on Saturday, managing career performances on the frigid day in Pullman. Before being pulled from the game to give redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne some reps, Kessler managed 400 pass yards on 21-of-32 passing, with five touchdowns. His 400 yards broke his previous single-game record of 394 against Fresno State.
Kessler’s favorite target, Agholor, finished the day with a career-high 220 receiving yards, one receiving touchdown and a punt return score. Only South Carolina wide receiver Pharaoh Cooper had more receiving yards over the weekend.
Though the Trojans prepared all week to face WSU quarterback Connor Halliday, an unfortunate turn of events knocked the nation’s leading passer out of the game. Early in the first quarter, USC junior defensive end Leonard Williams rolled across the back of Halliday’s legs and the quarterback immediately went down, writhing in pain. Halliday had surgery after the game on what reports say is a broken right fibula.
At that point, USC was already up 14-0. After a failed drive by each team to open up the game, Agholor returned a Washington State punt to the house for a 65-yard score. It was the Tampa, Florida, native’s second punt return touchdown of the season, and the fourth of his career — a new school record.
The Trojans stayed hot on the next drive, as senior linebacker Hayes Pullard picked off Halliday’s pass to the 19-yard line. Pullard’s first interception of the season led to the first of three touchdowns from Kessler to freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith to put the Trojans up 14-0 in just the first five minutes of the game.
But after looking explosive out of the gate, USC’s offense stalled. The Trojans consistently made big plays to get downfield, but were unable to follow them up and get in scoring position, finishing the day just two-for-11 on third down.
Kessler’s 49-yarder to Agholor to put USC on WSU’s 31 exemplified this trend. A run for no gain and two incomplete passes forced senior kicker Andre Heidari to kick a field goal, which put USC up 17-0.
Later in the second quarter, the Trojans capitalized on a WSU turnover on downs. Kessler threw a beautiful pass to Smith for their second connection of the day, which put USC up 24-0.
Though the scoreline didn’t show it, WSU’s backup quarterback, Luke Falk, filled in for Halliday admirably. The redshirt freshman finished the game with 370 yards on 38-of-57 passing, with two touchdowns and an interception.
Falk’s line got a boost when USC’s standout linebacker Su’a Cravens suffered a knee sprain in the second quarter. Cravens, a sophomore, injured his right knee on a non-contact play, and sported crutches following the game. Sarkisian said he did not believe the injury was serious.
Freshman cornerback-wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson and sophomore safety Leon McQuay III also suffered injury scares when they collided while attempting to pick off one of Falk’s passes downfield.
Sarkisian insisted that getting his injury-depleted team back to full strength was a priority over the upcoming bye week.
“We’ll embrace the bye, that’s for sure,” Sarkisian told the Pac-12 Network after the game. “We’ve got to get healthy.”
The Cougars got on the board once before halftime to send the game into intermission with USC up 24-7. They also struck first in the second half, kicking a field goal to close the gap to just 14 points.
Though the Trojans have struggled to close out games all year, they appeared to lock in after that.
Kessler launched a rocket to Agholor for an 87-yard score before hitting Smith again as well as redshirt freshman wideout Steven Mitchell.
Smith caught six passes on the day, three of which were touchdowns, marking a career high for the 17-year-old. Mitchell, meanwhile, hauled in just his second touchdown reception of his career. The first was Kessler’s seventh of the day in USC’s blowout over Colorado two weeks ago.
The Trojans now have a week off before they gear up to take on the California Bears on Thursday, Nov. 13.
Agholor insists that this month will be crucial for the team’s conference title hopes.
“November is very important for this program,” Agholor said. “To play the way we did tonight and to finish the way we did, I think it keeps us in a good position moving forward. We’re talking about progressing throughout November. At the end of the day, if we can put the pieces together, we can probably do something special.”
Quick hits
Redshirt freshman offensive lineman Khaliel Rodgers became the first player from Delaware to ever start a game for USC.
With his punt return touchdown, Agholor became USC’s all-time leader in punts returned for touchdowns (4).
USC avenged its 10-7 loss to WSU at home last season.
The Cougars fall to 2-7 overall and 1-5 in Pac-12 play.
Allen became the only player in the nation to have more than 100 all-purpose yards every game this season.
Allen also became the first Trojan since Heisman winner Marcus Allen to have more than 100 rush yards in six consecutive games.
By winning its sixth game of the season, USC rendered itself bowl eligible.
WSU finished with just 34 rushing yards.

Last Thursday, Mr. Athanasius Georgy wrote: “If a promising future of space exploration is to be had, missions and research need to be placed in the hands of NASA alone,” an assertion I must strongly contend with. The future of space exploration is the exact opposite. Rather than remaining the exclusive prerogative of national governments, space must be democratized! Elon Musk looks toward the day when humanity will become a multi-planet species, and he founded SpaceX with that vision. Even if that day never comes, humanity still needs to bring the rich resources of space back to Earth. Scientists studying alternate energy sources, such as fusion, need helium-3, which is rare on Earth but abundant on the moon. At  some time in the next 15 years, Earth will almost certainly run out of the extremely rare platinum-group metals that we need to make catalytic converters, cell phones and pacemakers. If commercial space exploration takes off, asteroid mining will be the answer.
Even after considering the Wallops Island explosion, there are few, if any, drawbacks for NASA in continuing to contract with private companies. The International Space Station will still get the supplies it needs on time, and Orbital Sciences is still required to successfully perform all of its contracted flights -— the taxpayer does not bear any burden for the mishap. NASA is not being reckless in its dealings either. Orbital Sciences has a 95 percent success rate for 284 launches in the last 30 years, and SpaceX was required to demonstrate its technology before being awarded spaceflight contracts. NASA also makes contracts with firms that have greater name recognition, like Boeing, which was contracted to begin ferrying crew to the ISS within the next few years.
Any setbacks NASA has experienced in recent years are less the fault of political maneuvering and more the fault of waning public interest. The public’s interest can and should be regained. By making agreements with private companies to use their rockets, NASA is encouraging the growth of the nascent space cargo industry. We can reasonably expect that growth will lead to better technology, and better technology will lead to cheaper flights, making space more accessible. A robust private space industry would revive the public’s imagination, encourage more kids to pursue STEM careers and stimulate America’s faltering manufacturing sector.
I also take issue with the idea that competition is somehow bad for launching rockets. In fact, NASA has a long history of working with competitive contracts, and competition is a core component of the American economy. If NASA were not contracting Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to buy cargo on their rockets, then it would still be contracting with the same companies to buy the rockets outright. The Space Shuttle program involved NASA contracts with Boeing, Alliant Techsystems, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies and others. These contracts were mostly on a “cost-plus” basis, meaning NASA agreed to cover the costs of development plus guarantee a profit for the contractors. Companies like SpaceX build their own rockets and agree to fixed-price contracts, giving them the incentive to develop efficient designs. Efforts to go to space are now more unified and economical than ever.
NASA is absolutely right to make contracts that allow private companies to develop their own rocket technology. It’s a far better solution than relying on Russia, and it is already proven to be cheaper than NASA’s old way of dictating to the contractors what the technology should look like. In the short term, NASA is supporting scientific research. In the long term, NASA’s contracts with bright companies like Orbital Sciences and SpaceX will usher in a new age of economic growth and jumpstart humanity’s reach for the stars.
Note: On Friday, after I had written a draft of this response, a Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo manned test vehicle crashed in the Mojave Desert. One pilot was killed, and the other was severely injured. I do not intend to trivialize this terrible tragedy; it is not comparable to the explosion of the unmanned Antares. Space exploration is a true challenge that takes bravery and determination, and my thoughts and prayers are with the families affected.

On Oct. 21, Toys “R” Us decided to pull Breaking Bad merchandise indefinitely from their shelves amid complaints regarding their appropriateness for children. The toy figures reflect characters from the acclaimed AMC show that revolves around a meth-cooking chemistry teacher, Walter White, and his sidekick, Jesse Pinkman. The decidedly kid-unfriendly nature surrounding these figurines incited anger from one Florida mom, identified as Susan Schrivjer by ABC News. She organized an online petition that garnered more than 9,000 signatures on Change.org. This pressure caused the toy retailer to withdraw its Breaking Bad products while, ironically, keeping other products with dangerous implications, such as Barbies and violent video games, on the shelves.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
In retaliation, Aaron Paul, the actor who portrayed Jesse Pinkman, took his outrage to Twitter. He asked on Oct. 23, “Wait, so @ToysRUs pulled all of the Breaking Bad figures from their shelves and still sells Barbie? Hmmmm … I wonder what is more damaging?” The same day, Paul followed with, “And what about all the violent video games you sell @ToysRUs? Do you still sell those? Florida mom really messed it up for everyone.” Paul’s statements challenge consumers to analyze the detrimental aspects of the toy industry.
It’s true that playing with collectibles that feature a meth-cooker and a guy whose tagline is “B-tch!” doesn’t represent the typical childhood. For me, it was Legos and Lisa Frank coloring books. Other popular merchandise that was picked up by Generation Y and Z include Polly Pockets and Power Rangers action figures.
But Paul does have a point in his tweets. Barbie, one of the most iconic dolls in the world, is made with unrealistic proportions. According to a study conducted in Finland, Barbie’s bust, hip and waist measurements put on a real-life scale would mean she would fall below the standard of body fat for a healthy female. She would also have to walk on all fours because her frail lower body would not be able to support her large bust. Her image deviates significantly from the average female American, a woman that stands at 5-foot-4 inches and weighs around 166 pounds, according to the New York Daily News. A fixture in many households throughout America, Barbie skews the perception of the female figure for young children.
Another valid point Paul makes begs us to evaluate video games children play. Video games introduce a simulated world in which kids are allowed to take part in shootings and car robberies. According to The New York Times, video games are becoming more realistic in development. Multiple studies have sprung up in recent years showing the correlation between playing violent video games and aggressive behavior in children. This aggression is measured by physical conflicts between peers among other types of violent antagonism. When twisted fictions become the norm for children, they proliferate the harmful ways that physically pit children against one another.
Though Paul brings two specific toy products to attention, it’s imperative to keep in mind the harm other toys inflict on childhood. G.I. Joe figures, which are marketed toward young boys, not only create unrealistic expectations of what male figures look like, but also reinforce the stereotype that men have to be tough and physically assertive. Moreover, in this technological age, many children entertain themselves with game apps, forgetting the fun and physical exercise they could enjoy  outdoors.
Toys should do two things for children. For one, they should provide a way for children to develop skills, such as caring for a doll or learning about handling money through games such as Monopoly. Toys should also act as creative outlets for the highly imaginative minds of children, which Barbies and video games do achieve. But instead of putting these iconic items on a pedestal, their damaging aspects should be explained to children, who are not as naïve as we make them out to be.
So, to the Florida mom looking to ban the Breaking Bad figures, I must ask the same questions. What about the Barbies? What about the violent video games? Blindly shielding your children from the meth cooker and his cohort achieves nothing when there is so much exposure to destructive toys already. We have to be responsible for children’s formative years and remove unhealthy implications all toys have — not just those from Breaking Bad.

It was in the adult toys section. Next to Freddy Kreuger, Jason Voorhees, the Gremlins, Ghostbusters and other toys that are priced and designed for adult display. The parents don’t have to buy them for their kids, and if the kids know all about Walter White, that’s on the parents.
Right. The “ideal” Barbie figure is ubiquitous in the Western world, anorexic models and movie stars everywhere with their grotesque figures. Favorable promotion of the drug culture is almost as common in movies, TV, rap and music. Apparently, a lot of people want this and agree with it, or we would not see so much of it. Human culture has always contained a variety of dysfunctional, sick and downright evil norms and standards. Stick-like women figures and glorifying drug pushers will pass someday, but probably the replacement fads will be just as nasty. Sorry. That’s human nature.
