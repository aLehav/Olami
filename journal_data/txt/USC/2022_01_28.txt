If I have to watch Los Angeles Lakers guard Russell Westbrook clank a midrange bank shot off the top of the backboard again, I might have to pick a new team as the focus of my column. 
The Lakers have played some of the ugliest basketball ever displayed by a LeBron James-led team en route to a 24-24 record and the ninth seed in the Western Conference. 
Top to bottom — from the front office to the coaching staff to the roster — the Lakers have a myriad of issues, but one man must take the lion’s share of the blame. Even though he’s averaging his highest points per game since 2010, at a certain point, we must hold LeBron James accountable. 
There is definitely some truth to the overused “LeGM” or “LeCoach” quips that run rampant on social media. Nothing happens in that organization without James’ stamp of approval. 
He is the greatest basketball mind the sport has seen — he has faced every defensive coverage thrown at him, every team’s offensive playbook ingrained into his photographic memory. In a recent matchup with the Indiana Pacers, James was even caught on video calling out his opponent’s substitutions seconds before it happened. 
So what exactly led this basketball savant to believe Russell Westbrook would be a good fit on the Lakers?
The 2020 squad that lifted the 17th banner in Staples Center served as the formula. James and Anthony Davis surrounded by scrappy 3-point shooters with defensive skill players who knew their role was a recipe for success. 
Instead, James opted to disregard that blueprint, pressuring the front office to acquire Westbrook in hopes that the ball-dominant point guard could take on some playmaking duties and make James a more lethal off-ball player.
But when palms get sweaty, and every possession matters, you want the ball in LeBron James’ hands. This is a pass-first guy that will probably surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points ever scored — you want him making the decisions down the stretch of tight games. Where does that leave Russell Westbrook?
Opponents will happily surrender jump shots to the inefficient nine-time All-Star, who’s shooting an abysmal 29.3% from beyond the arc and 39.4% from the midrange this season. Coaches will instruct their players to cheat off Westbrook and force James or Davis to see more bodies and clog up the paint. 
James showed a complete lack of awareness in his own offensive play style when he asked to team up with Westbrook. James is a ball-dominant player, and he’s also a ball-stopper. Often, he will hunker down to the post, surveying the defense for several seconds before making a move. Or he might dribble the air out of the ball before forcing up a contested jump shot. 
Meanwhile, no other Laker is moving. 
Compare the Golden State Warriors offense — a well-oiled machine composed of ball movement and player movement — to the Lakers offense, which is an overabundance of isolation plays with a clear lack of a true offensive system. 
James does almost everything on the basketball court at an all-time level, but he’s not a plug-and-play type of guy that can adapt to any constructed roster, especially in his 19th season in the league. 
To maximize his chances at a championship, James needs to play alongside players that fit his mold, so it’s shocking that the smartest basketball player of all time thought Westbrook was the missing piece of the puzzle. 
James’ obsession with putting together a different roster every season derailed any chance the Lakers have had at building genuine chemistry. General manager Rob Pelinka retained just three players from the previous season. This massive roster turnover came with 14 new players, many of whom had never played a minute of NBA basketball together. 
This lack of continuity makes dealing with coronavirus cases or injuries so much harder, as players bounce in and out of the lineup on a daily basis. For Head Coach Frank Vogel, installing a legitimate offensive system becomes even more difficult, leading to isolation-heavy basketball and an overreliance on James, Westbrook and Davis. 
James played against Westbrook for more than a decade, willingly giving up jumpers in an effort to deter the slasher from getting to the rim. 
How long can he stand by and watch Westbrook hoist up jump shots, knowing full well that is exactly what the defense wants him to do? 
James is the primary reason the Lakers have any wins this season at all, leading the team in scoring the last 18 games. Yet, he’s put himself in a position where he has to take on this monumental workload because of the roster that he put together — the roster that he specifically requested.
This time, LeBron James has no one to blame but himself.

USC is hoping to bounce back against Oregon State this Friday after consecutive losses to a UCLA team riding a four-game win streak. Although losing by 23 and 10 points, respectively, the Trojans improved their shooting percentage from 28% to 41% after an abysmal 2-17 from behind the arc the first time facing the Bruins. 
As the penultimate month of the season approaches, assistant coach Wendale Farrow has his players focusing on what’s right in front of them each week. 
“Our focus coming into this week is just take it game by game, day by day,” said Farrow in an interview with the Daily Trojan Wednesday. “If you can win two games in a weekend, you were the champion of that weekend. If you guys split, it’s OK, and if you lose two, it is very challenging. So, game by game, day by day, we’re looking for that focus to just play those 40 minutes.”
The Beavers won seven of their last ten contests against the Trojans, the most recent coming last February, resulting in a 25-point loss. 
Oregon State has a 9-4 record and is coming off four close games against conference opponents, losing by a bucket to No. 8 Arizona, followed by three and six-point wins against Colorado and Washington, the former went into overtime. Most recently, the Beavers suffered a 7-point loss to Washington State.
Leading USC, sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins averages 13.3 points per game and in her seventh-straight game scoring double figures. Her ability to attack the hoop and finish, as well as score in traffic, has proved essential to the team’s success. 
In key wins, like such as timely upset of the Wildcats Jan. 9, Jenkins sees defensive success as a way to create more opportunities on offense.
“When we are really smooth on defense is when it starts to turn into offense,”  Jenkins said. “We can do really well in transition and we can get better at it [to have] easy transition buckets, so having the defense turn into offense is major.”
Stopping players such as Oregon State’s leading-scorer, freshman guard Talia von Oelhoffen, from catching fire will be a challenge, but Farrow is confident in USC’s strategy on Friday. 
“We’ve really been preparing our scout team to imitate what Oregon State will do this week … We have a really good day of prep, [working on] our ball screen coverages, how we want to defend them, the ways we want to attack them on offense,” Farrow said. “I think our energy and enthusiasm will be there heading into our game.”
The Trojans are led by first-year head coach Lindsay Gottlieb, whose coaching pedigree includes NBA experience as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers and a Final Four appearance with UC Berkeley. 
Jenkins had high-praise for the first-year coach. 
“[Gottlieb] just preaches a lot about having a good team and just having good chemistry,” Jenkins  said. “She’s a really intelligent woman, and just her having a high basketball IQ really helps us out on the court and we listen to her. She’s a smart lady.”
The Trojans will begin their two-game road trip Friday against the Beavers. Tip-off is at 7 p.m.

After successfully sweeping UC Irvine Wednesday evening at Galen Center, the Trojans will look to achieve consecutive victories against the Anteaters to improve their 6-1 record this season. Despite their first loss at the hands of Ohio State, No. 10 USC prevented a second loss.
The Trojans secured a victory over No. 3 Penn State in a 3-1 upset victory at Westwood, before losing to No. 9 ranked Ohio State in a 1-3 defeat. Although the Trojans swept Irvine soon after, USC is 3-7 against the Anteaters in the last 10 bouts. 
Before  Wednesday’s loss, Irvine lost back-to-back matches against No. 8 BYU after starting the season with a 3-1 record. They currently hold a three-game losing streak, including the away loss at Galen Center. The Anteaters hope to create new momentum as they host the Trojans. 
Graduate student and outside/opposite hitter Sam Kobrine led the Trojans to victory with 14 kills, 2 block assists and 3 digs to quell and sweep the Anteaters. Before transferring to USC from UCLA this season, Kobrine earned a 2021 AVCA All-American honorable mention and was included in the All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation first team last season. 
The Trojans hope to maintain the same mentality and vigor entering the second fixture identical to the one held before Wednesday’s match. 
“UCI is a very talented team,” said Kobrine in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We are going to be ready and prepared for that first play.”
The Buckeyes’ victory over USC last Saturday marked Ohio State’s first victory of the season after narrowly losing to the No. 2  ranked UCLA by a 2-3 score. Despite the result, Kobrine believes the defeat will help the team in the long-run. 
“The first loss allowed us to reflect on some of our weaknesses,”  Kobrine said. “It’s honestly been pretty helpful for us. We know what we need to work on going into the rest of the season.”
The MPSF Offensive Player of the Week, redshirt sophomore and opposite/outside hitter Simon Gallas, managed 11 kills against Irvine in conjunction with 4 block assists to help propel the Trojans to victory. Gallas leads  the  Trojans in kills, with 103 so far this season.
Four players averaged at least 2 kills per set, with Gallas averaging approximately 4 per set. 
Kobrine credits team versatility and ability as crucial factors to achieving the double against Irvine. 
“The thing about our team is that anyone could do well on any given night,” Kobrine said. “I don’t know if I can necessarily single out one person. Anyone on any given night can perform at a high level.”
 USC will visit Brens Events Center Friday evening to continue their winning form and secure their first consecutive win over the Anteaters since their 5-game winning streak from 2009-2011. The match will start at 7 p.m.

A teenager living in South Central not far from USC, John Thomas and his friends had just finished playing basketball. Out of nowhere, three Los Angeles Police Department cars drove toward him and his friends, and officers handcuffed them on the ground and threw them in the back of a police car.
The officers led a woman to the back of the car, where Thomas and his friends sat, and asked her if they were the people who stole her purse. 
“Take a good look, because they fit the description,” Thomas said he remembers the officers saying.
The woman said Thomas wasn’t the one who stole her purse and the police released him. But even today, he thinks back to that event and how his whole life could have changed with “that one false accusation.”
A few years later, Thomas attended UCLA. With a record, he probably wouldn’t have gotten in, he said. Thomas joined LAPD a few years afterward, which he “definitely wouldn’t have” if the arrest had been on his record.
Thomas went on to spend decades working with the LAPD — patrolling the streets he grew up in — before starting with the USC Department of Public Safety in 2006, where he worked for 15 years, nine as chief. Thomas retired Jan. 12; in a Jan. 20 interview with the Daily Trojan, he reflected on his life growing up near USC, his career in law enforcement and the University’s changes throughout his life. 
Growing up near USC
Climbing the tree outside Moreton Fig and playing hide-and-seek throughout campus, Thomas said USC and its campus “[opened his] eyes that there was a possibility for [him] to go to college.”
When Thomas took AP classes at Crenshaw High School and needed library books, he used his Doheny Memorial Library card to access the books he couldn’t at school. An open campus without gates or a closing time like today, community members walked around the USC track for exercise where they didn’t “have to worry about being safe.” Thomas also went to the old University Village movie theater, the only movie theater in South Central and the 32nd Street Market, where he bought fresh fruits.
“If it wasn’t for me living and being in proximity to USC, the notion of that I can actually go to college, it would have never registered because nobody in my family had ever gone,” Thomas said. “If you went to high school and graduated, you got a job, and that was a reality for my family.”
At the same time, Thomas said he experienced profiling and unnecessary stops by members of the LAPD in the community and even DPS on campus. During his college years — when he would drive from South Central through Beverly Hills to UCLA — Thomas said he considered it “a good week” if he could go without being stopped on his way to and from school. 
One officer once said to him, “You have no business west of La Brea,” according to Thomas.
But to Thomas, who grew up in the community and remembers the prevalence of gangs and shootings in his neighborhood, USC didn’t play a negative role in changing the area he grew up in. 
“They just don’t know,” Thomas said. “Because if you grew up in the neighborhood, there was a sense of pride. We live near USC.”
Starting in Law Enforcement
Despite his negative experiences with law enforcement and the absence of a “burning desire” to enter the field, Thomas felt its importance was always ingrained in him. Thomas’s grandparents, who were sharecroppers and laborers in the rural south who migrated to California, viewed Black police officers as a “big deal” and “progress,” he said.
“Look at those guys, I’m proud of them,” Thomas’ grandparents would say when they saw a Black police officer.
After graduating from UCLA, Thomas began working at the Police Academy before starting at LAPD and patrolling the streets he grew up in. While he had some “great partners,” Thomas experienced “insensitive comments” and witnessed police misconduct firsthand. 
One day, Thomas and another officer had arrested someone, who began calling Thomas names and insults throughout the car ride. Thomas ignored the chirping, but when they got to the station, his partner “[turned] around and hit him in the mouth.” Thomas reported his fellow officer to his supervisor, and while he said it “ostracized” him for a little, reporting officer misconduct was the “right thing to do.”
“Quickly, it spread. If you do something like that, [I’m] not going to be silent,” Thomas said. “There were partners that said things to people that I said, ‘I’ll never work with you again.”’
Career at DPS
When Thomas joined DPS in 2006, he told his boss he would only stay for two years because of dysfunction within the organization and a lack of systems, training, communication and accountability. But he grew to love the University and DPS, connecting with students, officers and the community — ultimately staying for 15 years.
Since his retirement, Thomas — who recently changed his Twitter handle to “RetiredChiefJT” — said he’s received an outpouring of support over texts and social media from officers, faculty, staff and students. Though he struggles with goodbyes, Thomas said the department is planning “some kind of barbecue” after the current coronavirus surge where he can say goodbye to coworkers. 
Lynette Merriman, associate vice provost for Campus Support and Intervention, worked closely with Thomas, specifically when there was a “crisis” at DPS that involved reaching out to families or campus support. On certain occasions, Merriman said, Thomas picked her up and they’d drive down the 110 Freeway to campus together — each making separate calls to handle issues on campus. 
“It would be rare to find another chief who has pride in this neighborhood, and he does,” Merriman said. “And he has pride in USC. And I think it’s just a great combination to really connect the communities around the issue of pride and care.”
The Community Advisory Board, created to reform DPS, contributed to Thomas’ decision to retire, he said, as he feels confident in the organization’s direction and the Board’s recommendations. Thomas said that leaving now will allow new leadership the opportunity to lead without the “blinders” that come with working at DPS for 15 years. 
“You don’t see the full 360 perspective. You’re limited because you tried this and you ran up to an obstacle, and it didn’t work out,” he said. “That new person may not have those blinders and just see it from a different perspective.”
Still, before and throughout his tenure as chief, DPS has faced criticism from students, including accusations of racism and profiling — some of which have been documented on the @black_at_usc Instagram. There have also been reports of DPS hiring officers with prior misconduct records, including shootings, excessive force and racist comments. Under the Board’s recommendations, officers with misconduct records will no longer be hired by the department.
Thomas said he’s told students who are pushing for further DPS changes that, while progress is needed, there are also real concerns about crime that need to be addressed. 
“My hope is that in light of progress and social justice, people don’t get blinded,” Thomas said. “That it’s one or the other because you can truly have both. You can have a compassionate response to mental health and unhoused individuals.”
He cited the Keck Street Medicine Program, which is dedicated to providing resources and direct care such as medicine and blood tests for people experiencing homelessness, as signs of progress. The program, he said, came through looking at alternatives for “pure DPS response” for issues where it is “not the best entity to handle.”
David Carlisle, the interim DPS chief who served as assistant chief under Thomas, said he plans to follow Thomas’ lead in leading the organization, focusing on communication and transparency. 
“I plan to follow the lead of my predecessor … and [lead] our department in the interim, to work to fulfill our mission, which is to create an environment at USC that’s aligned with the University, President [Carol] Folt and the Community Advisory Board,” Carlisle said. 
Now, Thomas said he plans to start exploring another one of his passions: history, specifically that of early Black L.A. 
“That’s kind of where my next path has taken me,” Thomas said. “Because I’m a history nerd, to write about the history of early Los Angeles and early Black Los Angeles.”
On his last day, Thomas worked from home, attended Zoom meetings and spent time putting flowers on his mother’s gravesite, who passed away in March 2018. With about 34 years of total law enforcement experience, Thomas’ mother — Gertrude Thomas, a single mother to six children -— used to tell him that eventually, he would have to retire. 
Thomas said that it always “hung heavy” on his heart that his mother never got to see him retire, which is why he chose Jan. 12 as his final day: what would have been her 78th birthday.
“When I selected that date, I did a little tribute to her,” Thomas said. “So it was emotional for a couple of reasons and very reflective over the course of 37 years and 15 at DPS and nine as a chief. I think I wasn’t prepared for how emotional it was going to be that day, because I’ve never really given it much thought.”

Production, community and education — these three things build the essence of 24th STreet Theatre’s mission to the local community. 
Established in 1997 by executive director Jay McAdams and artistic director Debbie Devine, the 24th STreet Theatre, located a few blocks down Hoover from USC’s campus, focuses on quality storytelling, a helping hand and a platform for students and adults alike to learn more about themselves and the world through the performing arts. 
24th STreet Theatre provides “After Cool,” free afterschool classes for local students from second grade to high school, as well as a number of readiness classes for high schoolers, teachers and adults covering topics on leadership, college and professional development training for teaching. The Theatre also offers social justice, social-emotional learning and unconscious bias lessons.
“Starting in 2020, when all the schools were closed, everybody was locked down; we created a whole new thing online with live people. It’s not just a recording that we send them,” McAdams said. “[It’s] a whole team of teaching artists, musicians [and a] stage manager are all there, and we’re talking to the kids real time.”
In addition, the Theatre’s Latinx programming, directed by associate artistic director Jesus Castaños-Chima, brings non-professional Spanish-speaking actors onto the stage through community-based projects in the program, Teatro del Pueblo. Most participants are relatives or parents of the students within the after school programs, Castaños-Chima said. 
“To be able to provide that, to give them the tools to become a person, a better citizen. Because they’re not thinking about going to Hollywood and [making] movies, professional theatre, even though some of them do it, it’s not the intention. They just come here to entertain themselves to, as I said, enrich their lives in a different way, just come out from their routines,” Castaños-Chima said. “That’s something that I really enjoy and love to do.” 
Through professional Spanish theatre, Castaños-Chima and the Theatre have toured various cities in Mexico. 
According to educational programs manager Arie Levine, the value of theatre and the arts extends back to its basic form of physical storytelling.
“Art is entertainment, entertainment is art, and theatre is in the world of storytelling,” Levine said. “There’s so many ways to tell stories, but if you go back in time, it all comes down to a person and an audience, and theatre really distills that storytelling relationship to its most live, in-person form.”  
Theatre aids in social-emotional learning of awareness and empathy, as understanding characters’ perspectives through acting can transfer into real-life skills when encountering situations of conflict or disagreement, Levine said. Especially due to the advancement of digital communication and the current pandemic, McAdams said that the face-to-face interaction and communication that theatre arts requires is necessary and valuable.  
“At 24th STreet, we take the arts very seriously because we consider this essential, something crucial for the human being, for citizens to be more sensitive and [show] more concern [and be] more aware of what’s going on in our society,” Castaños-Chima said, “This is the way we can fight crime, we can fight many things — through [the performing] arts.”
But most importantly, through the performing arts, regardless of the form, Levine said, “kids become themselves.”  
24th STreet Theatre productions reflect current social issues for family audiences that keep them aware of the world in kid-friendly presentations. Adding vivid relevance, but not without a hint of — what McAdams calls — magic, the productions have been called sophisticated enough to be adult theatre.
“Whatever we do matters to our society … and we stage it in a very positive way,” Castaños-Chima said. 
The newest production, “Rapunzel Alone”, put on in association with The Wallis Annenberg Center for Performing Arts and written by Mike Kenny, is about Lettie, a young girl of multiracial heritage in London during World War II who is sent to the countryside to live with a stranger named Ms. Pearce. Inspired by the original fairy tale’s themes of isolation and connection, the production also explores racial issues.  
“The play is mostly about the relationship between Lettie and Ms. Pearce, who are both isolated in different ways, and their relationship together living through a very strange time in their lives,” Levine said. “Just like [how] we took inspiration from the time that we’re in now with COVID, where so many people feel isolated and are going through a time that is unlike anything we’ve experienced in our lifetimes,” 
Addressing social ills creatively for family audiences encourages the younger generation to be aware of them, while also sharing an enjoyable and educational experience with friends and family, McAdams said. 
“It wasn’t very long before the neighborhood started to come in the doors, and I started to realize that [the Theatre] was a tool. Theatre was the most useful if I used it as a tool to help people,” McAdams said, “But even beyond that, offering programs to kids and offering help to community members when they need it, we do that in all sorts of ways. For me, that’s how it’s changed, as I now see theatre not as ‘the place, the thing’ but as the place, the thing that we can help people with.”
Correction: Jay McAdams and artistic director Debbie Devine co-founded the 24th STreet Theatre and oversee its operations together. This article was updated to note Devine’s role as co-founder.

I believed in “California Love” long before I heard the Spirit of Troy do their rendition. In thinking about what to write for this week, I realized that I’ve talked about a lot of things I love in this column. I love good food and travel, but I haven’t talked about something I love a lot: Los Angeles.
I’ve lived in this city my entire life like many other USC students. I associate L.A. not with Grauman’s and a place where the biggest movie stars live, but with Capri Sun summer days, early morning light and the 10 Freeway. I was thinking about it this week, as shows come back from their brief winter hiatus, and as awards season looms large, how L.A. is irrevocably linked to the media. 
I’m frequently asked: “You’re a little bit in love with L.A., aren’t you?” Maybe a little bit. I love this city. I love driving in any direction and getting delicious food. I love Jonathan Gold, The Beach Boys and screaming Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A” with all the Lakers fans in the nosebleed seats after a win. 
Of course, it has problems. As a commuter, I’ve spent more time on the aforementioned 10 Freeway than Taper. It can cost an arm and a leg for lunch, a one-bedroom apartment easily goes for $2,000 a month. Not to mention how the Santa Ana winds I’ve fallen asleep to for 21 years are more a nightmare than a lullaby. But honestly, I love this city, and you probably do too if you have chosen to spend your university career here. Welcome to the Rachel Bernstein tour of L.A. Sorry, I’ll be ignoring Google Maps, I like my route better.
Let’s take this route: in the summer of 2020, I was going on a lot of walks and the sky was clear because fewer cars were out. It was the sort of day that reminds you why you don’t leave this city even when it gives you a hundred reasons to pack your bags. I’d been wanting to read Joan Didion for a long time and was unsure of where to begin, so I just chose the one that was available through my library first (If you work at Libby, sponsor me, please.)
First available was “Blue Nights”, published in 2011, and it is about the death of Didion’s daughter. It’s a winding road of a book skipping from one timeline to the next, touching on subjects of aging and motherhood and regret. This book isn’t happy. Of course, it isn’t. It’s an account of a mother outliving her daughter. As a result, it feels more meditative than other Didion books. She talks about where she found home: in Brentwood, PCH, Hollywood and the story of picking up Quintana after she was born at St. John’s in Santa Monica. 
In this book, I fell in love with Didion’s style. She sinks into her characters but still makes them human. But, it is in this book that, for obvious reasons, humanity is most apparent. She is dealing with a mother’s worst nightmare. The reader gets to see Didion in this book and as a result, see her Los Angeles: the Los Angeles post-Cielo Drive murders and when Malibu was still a little bit rustic. 
Malibu was once rough around the edges, but it’s probably better known now as a place with many fires. If you’ve lived here for any amount of time and gone deep into the westside in October, you’ve seen some ash dusting your car. Taylor Jenkins Ried’s latest release, “Malibu Rising,” is all about this seemingly annual occurrence and about four siblings that plan to have an epic party. The primary storyline takes place in 1983 over 24 hours and people from the Sunset Strip receive invitations to this supposedly epic party that’s going to take place at this beautiful cliffside home steps from the beach. As you might imagine, it’s less about the party and more so about the people — where they come from, and how they ended up in this vintage version of the Malibu that you probably know better from your Instagram timeline. Of course, though, one of the main themes of “Malibu Rising” is coming home, which is also true in Brandy Colbert’s “Little & Lion,” which has been ever-present on my favorites shelf since it came out. 
It talks about L.A., coming out, mental illness, a multiracial Jewish family and the power of love – no matter how cheesy that sounds. Our main character, Suzette, has come home from boarding school and fallen in love with the same girl that her brother is pining after. As you might imagine, that’s a less-than-ideal situation. Of course, it’s a very L.A. story as Colbert herself lives in the city and peppers in references to familiar locales. 
This was an indulgent column because I always find myself wandering back to L.A. I didn’t want to initially because I thought it was a literary wasteland. A place that was only built for the studios and the people that inhabit them and bark into megaphones. I used to think that there was no way that literature could thrive here. How could it, with such a reputation for green juice and pilates? I thought this even though I saw the embarrassment of riches that we have with indie bookstores. Ones for children and ones exclusively for romance books and so many more. 
I think it changed when I saw that you could write outdoors whenever you want, and I learned that authors I adored came to those indie bookstores for children and romance and they loved to talk about how they found home here. I knew this city needed to be loved on the page as much as New York and Chicago. So, I romanticize it now (like … in this column) and I love it for all of its messiness and its reputation. If you were to stop me and ask me to talk about the city, I’d tell you the lunch spots to go to (it doesn’t need to be a $14 sandwich to be good), the top-tier drive (Beverly Glen to Mulholland after it rains) and the L.A. books to read.

Watching a younger sibling, relative or friend grow up can be a fun experience as you vicariously age with them while reflecting back on your own personal experiences. 
Throughout high school, I remember joining my friend to pick up her younger siblings from the grade school I had attended just a few years back. There’s a sense of nostalgia that comes over you, one that certainly may lean one way or another depending on your impression of the place. 
For me, I loved grade school. It was an opportunity for me to basically go nuts for a few hours while also gaining positive reinforcement for good grades — an issue I still face today, but I digress. 
My friend, on the other hand, wanted to get out of school as soon as the bell rang and had a particular fondness for the independence that came with the high school experience. Regardless, watching her two siblings rush over to us after being released by their teacher helped those particularly lifelike memories also rush back into my mind. 
Now, they’re both in high school. I still often get the text to go pick them up, but soon enough, they started practicing for their permit exams and began grilling me for running yellow lights on our rides home. 
I know, too, that my parents, who have about double the years on me, had those instances of vivid nostalgia and bittersweetness as I progressed through different parts of my life. From my first steps to my graduation from high school to my third time crying over that one ex, these experiences are things that our parents or guardians see as part of our aging process — our character arc (mine has not really changed personality-wise, to be honest, but might have declined looks-wise). 
But watching my grandparents age, especially alongside my parents, illustrates a completely different story. I often contemplate what my life and their life will look like even a decade down the road. It can be an incredibly difficult and mentally-draining process. For some, maybe that decision comes easy because of generational wealth, siblings willing to care for parents, saved retirement or just a general sense of confidence. But, as part of a family that lacks all of those things, I can’t help but genuinely panic about how things will turn out. Often, I can’t even picture myself a few years down the road. Then again, I also fall asleep when I drink coffee so that might just be a personal issue.
It’s hard for my parents and myself to not ponder the “what-ifs.” What if I’m not financially stable? What if I feel overwhelmed or have too many responsibilities on my plate? What if I can’t find a place or housing space for them? What if they disagree with my decisions? They’re valid questions, but it’s hard to find those answers now. 
And even more prominent than the “what-if” is the “when.” When will all of these things pop up? Unfortunately, nobody can predict when these things will happen. Many college students, and even high school students, must undertake the responsibilities of being a caretaker for their parents. 
Like the differing experiences that my friend and I had gone through as grade schoolers, the way that we navigate generational aging will be individualized to each person. However, while no sense of time frame or certainty can be daunting alone, being prepared and knowing what to do when presented in such a scenario may hopefully give some ease.
Familial ties implore and often mandate us to care for older relatives or older adults in our lives. However, recognition alone should not be the only testament of the endless financial, physical and mental sacrifices endured by people who are figuring out their life. There should be more than just books or simple pamphlets dedicated to navigating such a long, tedious endeavor. Support from government outlets for older adults, such as Medicaid or Social Security, must consider how to improve financial support for younger people who choose to make that journey.
At the same time, perspectives on aging may differ from culture to culture. Obligations may be skewed or blurry when it comes to intergenerational care. Some may consider nursing homes or external living communities as the best way to go. Some may be financially stable enough to house older relatives in their own home. But, regardless of whatever route, we should not, and never opt into simply tossing individuals to the side for our own personal interests. 
Some frankly, do not feel that need to care for older relatives — be it vengefulness or even unawareness. But it may lay upon our shoulders to change the course of care and compassion, to change a course of trauma and anger. 
So, maybe I’ll pop up again here or there. But, for the meantime, when your kids might walk with you along Trousdale, asking you about what you were doing “Back in your day,” take time to be grateful for that opportunity, to be grateful for those around you.

I started my column out of rage. Pure boiling rage because of everything happening around me: a politicized pandemic, an insurrection at Capitol Hill, the continuum of racism and bigotry that left me speechless as to how our legal system could allow for injustice to pervade our society. 
My column became an outlet for all my anger against a seemingly unsalvageable justice system. Each article gave me a chance to understand more about the system I so desperately wished to be fixed, but I was always left wondering why the system is so broken.
After much reflection and endless research, I realized the one critical flaw of our legal system, its expectation for flawlessly standardized human behavior.
In a New York Times article, Adam Benforado explored the strategies needed to achieve true criminal justice in the United States and claimed that, even when we remove the issues of racism and personal biases, we will still not achieve true justice. 
“The reason is simple and almost entirely overlooked: Our legal system is based on an inaccurate model of human behavior,” Benforado wrote in his article. 
The U.S. Department of Justice was originally constructed in 1870 to preserve the existing power dynamics of that time, such as white supremacy, and used what The Intercept writer Alice Speri calls “an instrument of ruling class oppression.” Not only was the justice system limited by prejudiced beliefs of the past, it was also limited by the rudimentary knowledge of the mind. There was limited scientific evidence to back up the assumptions the world had regarding memory, decision making, deceit and how to deal with human behavior in a legal setting. 
However, this isn’t the case anymore.
Through the development of psychology and sociology, we have a greater understanding of what influences behavior and what truly acts as a deterrent against crime. Extraneous variables influence even minute behaviors, allowing implicit biases to permeate the legal system.      
One key example is eyewitness testimonies. Statistics from the Innocence Project show that approximately 69% of wrongful convictions in the U.S. are due to false eyewitness testimonies. Ongoing research demonstrates the unreliability of eyewitness testimonies, yet our entire criminal legal system continues to depend on them. 
Take cases such as Malcolm Alexander — the Innocence Project’s longest-serving exonerated client. Charged with life without parole and forced to serve 38 years for a rape in 1979 that he never committed, the program acquitted Alexander of his charges in 2018 after DNA evidence proved his innocence. However, nothing can change the 38 years of his life he missed out on.
Interrogations are filled with emotionally charged, misleading suggestions that can make a bystander seem guilty. Even when unintentional, they have irreversible consequences. We know now more than ever the limitations of impartiality, but understanding and being conscious of these limitations is how we can start to build a more just system. While we cannot change the beliefs of others, we can change the legal instruments used to prevent injustice.
From using double-blind procedures in lineups to implementing scientifically validated forensic and psychological techniques, we have the ability to create a justice system that more adequately reflects human nature. 
Researchers Tuomas K. Pernu from King’s College London and Nadine Elzein from the University of Oxford explains that legal judgments rely on the understanding of decision-making, yet the plethora of data regarding the neural underpinnings of human decision-making have “relatively little influence on legal practice.”
Many argue that, because of the nature of the legal system, science cannot be appropriately incorporated without being abused. However, the flaws that perpetuate injustice do not lie in the scientific field, but rather in the legal field. It’s the law that we must change, not the science. 
Citing Benforado once more, “The road to a more perfect system is accepting a model of ourselves that is less perfect.” It’s time for us to let go of our broken legal system and begin building a new road to true justice. For laws to change, the system needs to recognize that humans are flawed creatures, incapable of true rationality and impartiality. Instead, precautionary systems must be placed to prevent our own imperfections from destroying the lives of others.
