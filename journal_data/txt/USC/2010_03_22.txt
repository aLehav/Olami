Many students know USC raises a lot of money from alumni and other donors, but few know about the person whose job it is to raise that money.
Money talks · Sam Lopez, USC’s new assistant vice president for advancement communications, will work with President-elect C. L. Max Nikias on future fundraising efforts. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
For the past five weeks that person has been Sam Lopez, USC’s new assistant vice president for advancement communications.
“Fundraising is an art form,” Lopez said. “There are many ways it can be done. In the world of communications, we help get messages to the donors. We help connect the great ideas and talent of this university to its sponsors.”
Lopez said forming strong relationships between donors and the university is crucial to raising money.
“It’s about tailoring the message to the audience,” Lopez said. “We form partnerships between donors and what they care about. It’s like matchmaking.”
Though a major aspect of Lopez’s job is to raise funds for the school, his job also encompasses updating the school’s infrastructure. The Division of University Advancement constantly evaluates how the school does business and works to make enhancements that will raise the overall quality and cost-effectiveness of the university.
Re-evaluating the current infrastructure is especially important now, Lopez said, since USC’s administration will be facing changes upon President Steven B. Sample’s retirement. He has to ensure the office of advancement is working to meet the needs of the current administration, as well as the next.
“USC raises a lot of money,” Lopez said. “We’re one of the top universities for that, and we don’t want to lose that momentum.”
Courtney Surls, vice president of development, said a smooth presidential transition is something the Division of University Advancement has been preparing for the past two years.
“We know that [Nikias] has a bold vision for the future that will build on everything President Sample has already done,” Surls said.
Nikias’ aspirations for USC include doubling the size of the school’s endowment.
“He’s very focused on fundraising,” Surls said. “We’re making sure we have our systems and procedures aligned, that we have the right people in place, that it’s a very professionalized system.”
Peter Lasher, associate senior vice president for development, agreed.
“[Nikias] is coming in with a very ambitious plan,” Lasher said. “We have to help translate it into different donor postulations and help them understand how their private donations will make a difference.”
Lopez’s job is also made more difficult by the recent economic crisis, which has affected schools’ fundraising all across the nation.
“USC donations dropped 9.8 percent last [fiscal] year,” Lopez said. “It was still less than the national average, which was 11.9 percent. But as confidence in the economy returns, so will philanthropy.”
Lopez, however, said the biggest challenge facing USC isn’t fundraising at all, but changing certain perceptions about the school.
“Our biggest challenge is overcoming the perception that we don’t need resources,” Lopez said. “Without the support of alumni and friends, this place wouldn’t have the quality of education, research, academic programs, sports and more, that it has. It would be devastating.”
Lasher said the office needs to ensure that every small donation goes appreciated.
“Sometimes when we think about donors, we think about a big monolithic group,” Lasher said. “But we’re expecting a different kind of generation, and the practices we’ve traditionally used are evolving.”
Lopez, who’s been working in higher-education communication for 16 years and at three other universities, added that working in the division of university advancement has been great so far.
“There’s a lot of collegiality among advancement staff,” Lopez said. “A university is many pieces, and one area helps raise other areas.”
Though most students don’t know anything about the division of university advancement, it’s a function that all schools have and Lopez is more than happy to spread the word.
“The future philanthropists are current students, so it’s great to spread the word about what we do,” Lopez said.

In an effort to decrease the number of students walking home alone at night, the Undergraduate Student Government is considering a resolution that would push for longer operating hours for Campus Cruiser.
Cruising · Currently, Campus Cruiser runs until 2:45 a.m., but a USG resolution, if passed, would recommend extending those hours. - Mia Robinson | Daily Trojan 
Many students have voiced concerns about Campus Cruiser’s hours; Cruiser currently runs from 5 p.m. to 2:45 a.m. on the University Park Campus and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Health Sciences Campus.
Dawan Robinson, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering who worked as a Campus Cruiser driver during his freshman and sophomore years, said he has experienced instances when he was off campus and would have liked to use a Campus Cruiser, only to realize it was past 3 a.m.
“I’ve been in a conversation with friends, not looking at the time very well, and I wish I could use Campus Cruiser because I’m pretty far away and don’t want to walk,” Robinson said. “On those occasions, the extra time would be very useful.”
USG began looking into the issue last semester, when a survey of presidents and vice presidents of student organizations revealed 87 percent of those surveyed felt Campus Cruiser service could run later into the night, especially on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
Based on the survey and other research, Helen Moser, USG’s director of campus affairs, and Wilson Kyi, a residential senator, have drafted a resolution recommending the extension of Campus Cruiser’s hours until at least 3:45 a.m. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the resolution Tuesday.
“We’ve been talking about this for a while, and to move forward. We felt we needed an official document letting the administration know this is what we want,” Kyi said.
Moser said the initial presentation cited schools such as Yale, Berkeley and the University of Chicago as models.
“You look at these schools, some of which are in neighborhoods similar to ours, with programs similar to ours, but some of them run 24 hours, or maybe an hour later than ours does,” Moser said.
Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation, noted that there are options for students looking for a ride after 3 a.m. These options include the trams, which run 24 hours Monday through Friday, and the Leavey Library shuttle, which offers rides from Leavey.
“Students can also call [the Department of Public Safety] to schedule a ride from the Leavey Library driver or contact Yellow Cab,” Mazza wrote in an e-mail.
Mazza said USC Transportation has been considering offering Cruiser service later into the night, but that it could put a strain on Cruiser drivers, all of whom are students.
“We have been looking at creating some kind of on-demand service for students after 2:45 [a.m.], yet we don’t want to encourage students staying out after 3 a.m.,” Mazza wrote. “The reality is it is hard to find students who want to work from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. Our Leavey Library shuttle shifts are the most difficult shifts to fill.”
Still, Robinson said that based on his time as a Cruiser driver, he is not sure this would be an issue.
“They already have student workers who work past 3 o’clock, anyway,” he said. “And the only thing I can think of as a drawback are students who have class at 8 a.m., but those aren’t the students who would sign up to work that shift.”
Beyond extending hours, many students say they would like to see further revisions to the program.
“I’ve called, and it wasn’t too late — I just couldn’t get a cruiser,” said Blake Davidson, a freshman. “It was a Thursday night, and the wait time was like an hour and a half. So I just ended up walking. They should have a cancellation option, so if someone decides they don’t need a cruiser, the cruiser doesn’t still show up instead of picking up someone else.”
Heather Ritchie, a freshman majoring in theatre, said she would like to see Cruiser offer service to more locations.
“I would revise the places they offer services to,” she said. “They refuse to take people to New-North because it’s on a tram stop, but that’s one of the biggest freshman dorms.”
In addition to its desire to represent the concerns of students, USG is seeking to alleviate the stress imposed on DPS officers, who are often obligated to escort students once Cruiser shuts down for the night.
Moser said the resolution, if passed, will mark the first step in what she sees as an ongoing process to streamline the late-night service offered to USC students.
“If this is successful, and if students communicate that they want more later on, we might push for more hours,” Moser said. “The point of this resolution is to really show that we support this as USG, and it’s also something students support.”
wow tucker reed i think you’ve touched on a touchy subject! thats the most opinionated response comments i’ve ever seen for a DT article! and in a matter of dayssss
“If you hate your job so much, just quit, drop out, and go to a university that DOESN’T care about its students, since you want that so much.”
Okay.  No one signed up for this job under the pretense of having to work that late.  If the school cared about all of the students it would realize that  the accomodation of students so that they can participate in more reckless behavior is not worth the strain that would be put on the STUDENT workers.  As for the boycotting idea, that wouldn’t last 5 minutes, becasue the students at USC are much too spoiled and lazy to actually walk the places they need to go.  There should be a day when cruiser is completely shut down, and maybe students would see how fortunate they actually are.  Extending cruiser hours wouldn’t be about “safety” or “caring for students” – it would be about keeping the people with all the money happy.
Hi Student,
I am a cruiser and a student too! Actually, I have worked at Campus Cruiser for over three years, and I love my job and my co-workers. I would like to point out that, most likely, the reason why the majority of comments posted in response to this article is because we are the ones that are directly affected by the resolution’s passing. 
I would also like to point out that the majority of us don’t hate our job, we just don’t like being exploited, unappreciated, and disrespected, as you have done in your previous comment. 
Who said anything about the University not caring about its students? We’re not saying that the University doesn’t consider the safety of its students; we’re saying that viable options already exist after our hours. The school and students cannot afford to throw away money at redundant services. The fundamental misunderstanding is that Campus Cruiser is not a convenience service to pander to the students’ whims.
I worked the leavey library shift (3am to 7am) once or twice a week last semester, and I got 3 to at most 8 calls a night from DPS dispatch for students requesting rides. Maybe that has changed during this semester, but when I worked it, most of my time was spent sitting behind leavey and occasionally taking a late-night studier home. 
So before USG tries to “alleviate the stress imposed on DPS officers”, they may want to investigate just how much stress is imposed on DPS officers. It doesn’t make sense that DPS doesn’t ask for more help from an idle leavey driver if rides are in such demand after 3. 
Also, DPS does not need to feel obligated to escort students once cruiser shuts down. The trams run 24 hours. If a student doesn’t feel safe waiting or is not on a route, yellow cab is available. There is no cruiser or DPS to babysit us in the real world!
I second this!  Real world, darlings!  In case you forgot, you already graduated from high school!  Hopefully, you are not living with your parents here – so why act as if you deserve special treatment, need to be protected and coddled?  Would you like Cruiser to read you a bedtime story too as you teeter on the edge of ethanol-induced unconsciousness?  This just in: Cruiser rides come with complementary teddy bears.
If you really think you are entitled to such free rides, call your mommy!
Notice how the only people who disagree with the resolution are the employees of campus cruiser. That is a big LOL.
All you cruisers are doing is making yourselves look cold and heartless. If you hate your job so much, just quit, drop out, and go to a university that DOESN’T care about its students, since you want that so much.
I say we all boycott cruiser so they don’t get the users they hate so much and then the school will cut funding to it, and then these losers will be out of a job.
I am proud to offer this service as it currently stands, and I am very happy with my job.
But no, I don’t want to stay up until dawn so that you can party an hour later. Not so much heartless as exhausted.
Please do everyone a favor and boycott cruiser, because then we wont have to deal with your pathetic drunk arse.  Our budgets wont be cut because we still have people who are in need of a ride and not the retarded calls for 10 guys going from one side of the row to the other.  most calls we take on Thursdays through Saturdays are for drunk people in a group of 4 or more.  In that case it is not for saftey.
Also you have no idea what Cruiser is like. work a day and put up with people like yourself.
Cruiser is a great job so ef you.
I don’t know if you realize that if all of the funding is cut for campus cruiser you will have to walk your spoiled butt around or even take the tram.  cruiser is here to help I don’t understand why you are trying to bring it down.
Wow. What a comment. I’m sure USC, the loving school you praised so dearly, is proud to have such a compassionate member among its student body.
We don’t hate our jobs. We hate the people who think we are taxi drivers or some sort of servant. You can come ride along with me and see how your peers treat us.
Better yet, if you’re so down with the extra hour, I volunteer you as our first new G shift cruiser. You think you can handle it?
And about the “spoiled” comments…it’s more that students feel super entitled to clog up our system with calls from 23/portland to 23/toberman (real call) or a d pi to pacific at 6pm when it’s not raining (real call) or 2800 Ellendale to 2632 Ellendale (real call)…or the best one I got tonight…
Gamma Phi Beta to TKE.
Like it has been mentioned, we are about promoting safety — but safety is more needed for kids going to Catalina St. from Leavey every night, not to drive your partying ass home from TKE to Gamma Phi Beta.
cold and heartless? cruisers? never!
we truly enjoy our jobs dude!
maybe its the people we pick up like yourself that are cold and heartless. having us pick YOU up while you cant hold your liquor and are stumbling around, looking like a dumbass is definitely worthy of some merit on OUR part. 
I would really love to see you do our job just for one day. that’s all. one typical, 6 hour shift on either a thursday or saturday night.  see how people we pick up treat us. then maybe you will reconsider this boycott and maybe give us some credit for the shenanigans we deal with and the hooligans on the row we are constantly harassed by. and forreal how hard is it to just make sure to call in before 2:45am? get your lazy ass off that nasty frat house couch and either walk your own pansy ass home or call a cab! its THAT easy? wowza! 
and honestly, this boycott you’re proposing wouldnt last a day. you lovely human beings are used to having that sense of entitlement for every service that is provided, especially campus cruiser. so really, good luck with that proposal. 
i suggest you learn to use some of those morals your mama taught you and give us, your fellow trojans, some appreciation and love! 
love,
the cruiser losers who save your ass from getting run over on the row!
of course we disagree with the resolution. if your job made you work to 4-5am wouldnt you argue about it?
we’re not the cold and heartless ones. we pick you up even if you’re stumbling around in the streets. we dont hate our jobs its the people shouting at us because we were late or yelling because we wont take them down the street that we hate. 
boycott us. do it.
I completely agree with one of the remarks posted earlier that the university should not be responsible for students partying/drinking/whatever until dawn. To spend money on students who engage in such activities is absolutely wrong and I would be extremely upset if my tuition or USG student fee went to providing a service for those students. This is absolutely ridiculous to consider extending hours past 2:45am. I don’t even think that it is safe for the drivers to drive that late. There should be no pity for students who stay up that late to party or whatever. If you need to pull an all-nighter stay home.
87% of all students want us to extend our hours. I didnt see 87% of USC in the USG meeting today. I did see 25+ pissed off Cruisers who wanted their voice to be heard, but as it turned out, very few of us were allowed to talk because our hands werent raised or it wasnt fashioned into a question.
This is just the USG blowing smoke because they want to try and put forth a new idea to make themselves look good and make themselves seem like they have relevant say over decisions within this university.  Every once and a while we get an article highlighting something “big” the USG plans on doing just to remind us that they’re still there.  
Bottom line is this isn’t going to happen, and in the unlikely event that it does, USC will soon realize what a big mistake it was to let a few young students decide to extend mandatory work ours for other students who already work until 3AM and drastically increase the cost of a SUPPLEMENTAL transportation service.
This article is RIDICULOUS.  I can only second everything that other cruisers have said, emphasizing
(1) USC DOES have a 24-hour transportation service
(2) Common courtesy goes a long way.  Say please, thank you, and have a good night to your Cruiser.  Do not lie and pretend you’ve put in a call when you haven’t.  DO NOT FLAG US DOWN IF YOU HAVEN’T PLACED A CALL.  Do not adjust the music or the air conditioning without asking; this is not your car.  Realize when your Cruiser is on the radio and be quiet so they can talk to Control.  And please, don’t step in our car if you’re two seconds away from spewing your innards.  Guess who has to clean it up?  And this is supposed to be one of the top schools in the nation?
(3) FREAKING WALK.  Those Ellendale to Ellendale calls are absurd and an insult to the students who honestly do need a ride to/from shadier parts of the neighborhood.  If it would take you less time to walk to your location than it would to walk from one corner of campus to the other, DO NOT CALL A CRUISER.
I do agree that we might extend our boundaries – but not our hours.
LOL. Ellendale to Ellendale calls are the best.
A few things here coming from a cruiser that has worked for 5 semesters.
1. Students that are out past 2:45am are those irresponsible students that are partying late and getting drunk, extending hours past 3:45am will just make us Cruisers (who are all students) pick up more drunk students.  And for those of you who have never worked for cruiser, working 4-8hrs picking up drunk, smelly, rude, and loud students is not the highlight of my time here at college.  So you students out past 2:45am use a tram, DPS, or Leavey Shuttle to get home, it’s your responsibility to know how your getting home before you go out.
2. Why is USC encouraging cruiser drivers (STUDENTS) to be up past 2:45am driving around South Central LA, a city with one of the highest crime rates in the nation.  I assure you sitting outside alone, in front of a house west of campus at 2:00am waiting upwards of 12 minutes for someone to either show up or not show up is not at all SAFE or FUN.
3. If you expect me to work til 5:00am, I expect to get paid some 5:00am money..say a $10/hr increase in pay for working past 3:00am and also i’m going to need some other incentives.
4. How about some USG members ride along with a cruiser for a 6 or 8hr shift on a Thursday night, and you let me know about extending those hours.
5. This idea sounds great in theory, but the problem is none of the people pushing for the change have any idea what it means to be a Campus Cruiser, so don’t try to change the way we do things for your benefit because I assure you after working 5 semesters I have stories about sooo many students here, including some of our friends on USG!
Campus Cruiser has made countless improvements over the four years I have been at USC. What more do people want? The decision to support this resolution was based on a survey. Give me a break–of course students are going to say they want more hours on a survey. That doesn’t mean that it is feasible. Perhaps the “research” USG should have done was on the reality of extending cruiser’s service by an hour…or “researched” the fact that students do have methods of transportation after 3 am.
Wow. As a cruiser AND someone who works in journalism (not the DT, thank you very much) I am outraged by not only this ridiculous display of spoiled whining on the part of the students quoted in this article, but by the lack of transparent and informed reporting that plagues this article.
First of all, why not interview some CURRENT or DEDICATED cruisers? There’s a ton of them who really take this job seriously and would have provided a nice counterpoint to all the “OMGGG THEY MAKE ME TAKE THE TRAM” business going on here.
Secondly, USC should not be responsible for its students’ bad decisions. If some dumb girl finds herself wasted at a frat house at 3am, it’s not Cruiser’s responsibility to get her home. It’s HER responsibility to be responsible enough to get home in the first place. Cruiser is a free service provided to students BY OTHER STUDENTS. It’s not a right, but a privilege and a nice bonus to those students who don’t live on tram routes. If you’re out on the row past 3am, take the tram back to campus. 
For all the calls we get of people saying they “don’t feel safe” taking the trams alone, I have some choice words for you:
1. You’re not alone. Many students use the trams at all hours of the night.
2. What’s any difference in boarding a bus with a bunch of students than getting in a car with a bunch of students. (This always makes me scratch my head.)
3. On our busy nights (rainy nights, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays) taking the tram can be much faster than a cruiser. I don’t get the people who complain about our wait time of 30-40 minutes and then yell at us even more when we tell them if they take the tram, they can get there in less than 15 minutes.
USG is making a big mistake in even CONSIDERING extending cruiser hours. We are not hired staff with benefits like the tram drivers. We are students. We have personal lives. We have homework. Our world does not revolve around taking you to the 9-0 (we don’t do that, by the way, so stop asking) or giving you a round trip to Leavey at 2am. A lot of students treat cruiser drivers really poorly, and articles like this only reinforce the bad treatment these hardworking students get from their more “entitled” peers.
So, proposed steps?
1. Give this writer a severe Journalism 101 review.
2. USG should remind students that they can call USC Taxi or DPS post 3am, or that they should secure rides with friends.
3. USG should consider extending the cruiser service route, not the hours. More students are living in the areas west of Hoover (24th and 23rd streets) and have to walk in pretty poorly lit areas to catch rides. It makes me feel really horrible for them, more so than the people who complain about taking a tram from New North to TKE.
I have given rides to FEW people who truly understand and appreciate the service the university provides. Not only is it a service UNLIKE any other thats FREE, other university services that are comparable to USC’s campus cruiser most likely dont have as big a clientele as the row people, freshmen, etc that USC has.
Although USG likes the idea of a mere extra hour of work, resources are scarce for providing willing students for those time slots.
There is a leavey shuttle that takes students home from 3a-7a and this position alone is the most difficult to fill.
USE THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES THAT USC ALREADY PROVIDES. 24 hour trams. DO IT. All the whining about taking a tram?? Save your breath because it is just as reasonable a service as cruiser.
CABS? They take discresh!! What more do you need!
DPS! They can take you home too!! WHAT??!! 
People, really, be considerate.  All of campus cruiser is student run.  We do have lives too ya know. And working for cruiser is usually just a means of paying bills.  We dont necessarily enjoy taking your belligerent, drunk, and rude friends home.  A little appreciation and thanks goes a long way.
this article is pathetic and so are all the USG representatives
This is unbelievable. It shouldn’t be the school’s responsibility if students want to be out past 3 am, and there’s absolutely nothing productive that they could be doing at such a late hour. If a student feels the need to party until dawn, they can take a cab. We’re adults, we should be responsible and be able to think ahead.
As a cruiser, I love my job, but I am required to work at least one shift until 3 am, and I have to say those really wear me out. If I had to extend that to coming home past 4 am (because on those late shifts I can never get home until at least 3:30), it would mean getting to bed at 5, and that’s just too much to ask of a student. Cruiser is a supplement to our 24-hour trams, which I take and are an excellent service. USC has the leading cruiser service in the country, I can’t believe that students are really complaining about it.
It would also be nice if a current cruiser had been interviewed. There is a lot of missing or incorrect information here, and it’s very biased. This plan is absurd, and the reasons as to why should have been reported.
According to his profile, Dawan drove for Cruiser a record-breaking two whole months…two years ago. Great references!!
And something I don’t think is stressed enough – Is USC really encouraging its students to be out late? Nothing good happens after 3AM.
there is already a leavey shift, which one or two cruisers work from 3am – 7am, shuttling students from campus back home.  this shift is ALREADY extremely difficult to fill, even just finding one cruiser out of 130 to work it, so what makes you think we’ll have a full 30 person shift after 3am?
if you are going to write an article about campus cruiser, at least check your facts. every comment on this article so far has proven that.
smackdown ya’ll! cruiser ftw
FYI university of chicago (where i went to in high school) doesn’t have a campus cruiser service per se. It oonly has a program where you are allowed to ride local public transportation for free with a student ID.
Once again, get your facts right.
1. This isn’t an issue of getting a ride, it’s of getting a FREE ride. If you can’t manage to get a ride on the university’s dime after 3, you have the responsibility of taking a cab. It’s not by any means our problem that you’re out that late and didn’t consider any way of getting home. 
2. We are a supplement to the trams. Heather Ritchie: because New North is so popular, the trams all provide service to it! You can’t get a cruiser because you’ve already been taken care of.
3. Nobody considered the thousands upon thousands of dollars it would take to effect any of these changes. More people to work, more cars to drive, etc. This plan is not exactly nuanced.
4. There are so many factual errors and oversights in this article. Why wasn’t the manager of Campus Cruiser contacted?
I love my job, and have a great time talking with passengers, but seriously the USC public is extremely uninformed and ignorant about cruiser operations. There is a reason why we have trams, it simply costs too much to continue to buy cruisers (both the cars and the workers). New north would take up 50% of our calls if we didn’t tram there, thus making this supposed 1.5 hour wait (which I haven’t seen since I started over a year ago).
Extending hours won’t solve anything. It will encourage more people to stay out late, while also forcing student workers attempting to pay for college to work way later than any student should have to. Campus Cruiser has enough trouble getting a (yes A as in 1 and only 1) driver to drive the leavey shuttle from 3am-5am/3am-7am. Sometimes we go without a leavey driver because you CAN’T force a student to work this late. How in your right minds do you think you’ll get 10+ drivers at 3am? 
As for the statement that only workers with 8am class won’t have to work this late, well what about 9am,10am,11am, or even noon class? Given this shift, workers wouldn’t be getting off until 4:15am, home by say 4:30. If you all honestly can say your fine with <6hours of sleep every night you work, then so be it.
And as for the weekends, cruisers have lives too, we all just need to pay the bills. So please please be nice to your cruiser, I know I always return the favor. 
Fight On!
“They already have student workers who work past 3 o’clock, anyway”
everybody stops working as soon as the last call is dispatched. We only work past 3 if there are still calls in the system.
get your facts right.
Not to mention we’re required to work at least one shift to 3 am just to have this job. Very few people are willing to work the Leavey 3am-7am shift even though it pays better.
Most of the people out after 3 am are not doing anything productive, and DPS probably gets more calls from people locking themselves out of their dorms than actual escorts.  It’s a person’s own decision to be out that late anyway, so it’s really unfair to hold someone else responsible for getting them home safely.  Furthermore, just as it is required now for all cruisers to work until 3 am at least one night a week, extending hours would result in a requierment for cruisers to work until whatever the new closing time would be.   This is a ridiculous idea.
FYI. I looked at the yale website. They don’t have a cruiser system. They have 24 hour TRAMS just like we have. Campus Cruiser is the model for ALL other safe-ride home programs. We have the most comprehensive system and largest fleet of any other university.
Really? 4am. If you haven’t sat in a car driving drunk, mean, rude people for 4-8 hours before, give it a try then start talking sh*t. Also, from ACTUAL experience of working the Leavey Library shift, it sucks. We stay parked there until 7 am waiting for people to come up and grab a ride. If its a busy night, we handle the calls that DPS is supposed to take; their obligation is calling us to give you a ride. 
As a cruiser, I take the trams. Its efficient. Every tram stop also has signs posted on the route that they will take and what times they leave at. If you are on the Cruiser Express Route, the person on the phones will tell you when it should arrive at your location. As other cruisers have pointed out, the wait times would increase significantly. 15 minutes is not a long time to wait so please dont shout at me if I tell you to wait that long.
Also, “please” and “thank you” at the end of your call wont kill you. Common courtesy.
If students were well informed on the Cruiser express route and the tram routes we would be much more efficient and students would not have to wait an hour. as for a means to canceling a call. There are two ways, by calling in or texting. So many people call in asking for a ride that the tram services but refuse to take it even when we can usually tell then when the tram is going to be there. More often then not, the tram will get you were you want to go quicker than a Cruiser, especially on busy nights.
Dear Heather Ritchie,
The reason they can’t offer you a ride is exactly the reason you pointed out. “It’s one of the biggest freshman dorms.” There is already a tram from New-North to the row. If you got a cruiser then it would back up the entire system and even more people would complain. Wait times would be over an hour every time, guaranteed. You can track the trams online so you don’t even have to wait outside. Stop your b*tching and take the tram.
Wow. This is a horrible idea. If you guys want to extend cruiser hours how about you work them? How does our university look if we need to extend our hours until 4 in the morning because people are out partying? Did you all know you can call DPS after cruiser hours if you need a ride? The people working at campus cruiser are all students. If you want to extend our hours we’d better be getting a HUGE raise.
wow…really is the university of spoiled children

With the announcement that Executive Vice President and Provost C. L. Max Nikias will serve as USC’s next president, students and faculty members say they have high hopes for the continued growth of the university.
Student leaders said they hope Nikias will be visible and accessible throughout his tenure as president.
“If he came out showing a huge interest in listening to the student voice and listening and helping the students accomplish what they want to accomplish to make USC a better place for all of us, we couldn’t ask for more than that,” said Chris Cheng, the Undergraduate Student Government president-elect. “We’d love to see him proactively engage with the students.”
Both Cheng and Johannes Schmitt, president of the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, said they hope to hold regular meetings with Nikias to advocate student concerns.
“Something I know the students would appreciate is having their input given to him because he does make tremendous decisions for the university,” Cheng said.
Schmitt said Nikias has a tough task in succeeding Sample, but he does see several areas he hopes will be improved during Nikias’ presidency.
“The challenge for the next president is … to make the Trojan experience not only for undergraduate students but for graduate students as well,” Schmitt said. “Many of the things that are there for undergrads do not exist, at least to the same extent, for graduate students.”
Schmitt said increasing graduate-student housing to guarantee university housing for all first-year graduate students and offering competitive scholarships are ways to better include USC graduate students.
Amy Shah, incoming president of the University Residential Student Community, said housing is a primary concern among undergraduates as well.
“One of the ways to make USC stronger and have more people connected to it is by making it more residential and … making this really a home than a place where you are five days a week,” she said.
Undergraduate students also see the potential for improvement in academics, specifically the quality of professors, classroom dynamics and educational opportunities.
“A lot of emphasis needs to be put on showing students the opportunities available to them through their classes,” said Eric Ronan, the Interfraternity Council president.
Students have many concerns they hope Nikias will address as president, ranging from expanding the Lyon Center to making transportation more environmentally friendly. Sabha Salamah, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development, said the key is “having an open dialogue with the students to learn their concerns, so he could effectively address them.”
Students agreed that appointing Nikias as president will help continue the university’s success, though some noted there could have been benefits to hiring an outside candidate.
“The only downside I see is that you can’t bring good change from an outside perspective,” said Velma Coronado, a junior majoring in accounting, who would like to see more diversity in the USC student population.
Schmitt noted that many were still upset students were unable to sit on the search committee, but they appreciated that the committee considered their concerns about maintaining continuity.
“Because Provost Nikias has been here for so long and is as much a part of USC as anyone else, I think he can continue to build on what President Sample has done and take it in the next direction,” Shah said.
Faculty members agree that Nikias’ familiarity with USC will be good for the university.
“USC has a very unique culture, and I think it takes some time to understand what it means to be a part of the Trojan Family and I think Max has that now in his blood,” said Warren Bennis, professor of business administration, economics and finance as well as a faculty representative on the presidential search advisory committee. “It’s an enormous advantage.”
Bennis noted that he thought because Nikias is familiar with the university and how it runs, he will not be afraid to make changes.
“Max is capable of both, on one hand, adhering to and celebrating the symbols of what has led to our success, as well as reinventing in some significant uncharted ways of creating a new [and] a better USC,” said Bennis, who was formerly the president of the University of Cincinnati. “We can’t afford to do the same old thing.”
Bennis said that USC faces different challenges than it did 20 years ago, which will require a new perspective, the ability to gauge the future of the job market and the hiring of interdisciplinary professors.
Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta said he hopes Nikias will expand Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative and make that the centerpiece of his presidential philosophy.
“The arts are transformational. He can articulate that better than any of us,” Cutietta said. “Somebody like him who understands the arts and the power of the arts — that can be infectious.”
Another challenge Nikias will face is fundraising in a difficult economic climate, Bennis said, but faculty members are confident in his abilities.
“He has shown tremendous ability to engage people that are not necessarily USC alumni to support the university,” said Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering.
Robert Rasmussen, dean of the USC Gould School of Law, said Nikias’ experience as a professor, dean and provost will help him set a course for the school’s future.
“Provost Nikias already understands both why we’re a great university and how we can become an even better university,” Rasmussen said. “His emphasis on transcending boundaries is really going to transform who we are and continue to make us one of the leading universities in the world.”
Because Nikias will not need a year or two to become acquainted with the university, many believe he will be able to hit the ground running. The transitional period could have stalled USC’s recent growth, which some said they believed might have weighed heavily in the selection process.
“He has a very good sense of what needs to be done here,” said Elizabeth Daley, dean of the School of Cinematic Arts. “Max Nikias is a real visionary leader [and] absolutely the right person, at the right time, to lead this university.”

There are many similarities between President Steven B. Sample and President-elect C. L. Max Nikias — both are electrical engineers, gifted fundraisers and positive personalities — but Nikias intends to make his own, distinct mark on the university when he takes over the top job in August.
Moving on up · C. L. Max Nikias, the current executive vice president and provost, will become the 11th president in university history when President Steven B. Sample steps down from his post in August. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
“You cannot clone President Sample,” Nikias said. “But by far the best way to honor his legacy is by taking a great university and making it even greater.”
Nikias, currently USC’s executive vice president and provost, was named the university’s 11th president on March 11. He will take over the presidency August 3, following in the footsteps of his mentor and one of the most successful university presidents in recent memory.
Sample will not be an easy act to follow, Nikias acknowledged. Under Sample’s leadership, USC shot up in the rankings as its endowment grew, admission rate dropped and prestige rose. Sample has also been widely recognized as one of the most accomplished and respected figures in higher education.
Still, Nikias said he sees it as a challenge and a duty to live up to the reputation Sample has built for USC.
“There is an old proverb that says, ‘Stepping into the shoes of a legendary figure, you have to accomplish twice as much in order to be considered a success,’” Nikias said. “For USC, of course, we’re going to need to achieve twice as much. [Sample] will expect nothing less from me.”
To help accomplish that, Nikias plans to undertake several specific initiatives, including working to enhance the caliber of the graduate and professional student bodies, accelerating USC’s transformation into a residential university, weaving the global experience into the curriculum and bringing USC’s medical enterprise to the highest level.
His first step, however, will be to help the school grow financially.
“By far the most important thing for me as president after August is to work very hard and prepare the university within 12 months to announce a new fundraising campaign,” Nikias said.
Nikias’ predecessor is known for his extraordinary fundraising abilities; during his time at USC, Sample led the most successful fundraising campaign in higher education history to date.
In a previous interview with the Daily Trojan, Sample said he considered Nikias to be a talented leader.
“He does a terrific job, he’s an outstanding leader, so far as I can tell … I know a lot of people in the business, [and] I think he’s the best provost I’ve ever known,” Sample said.
Ultimately, Nikias said, his goal is to cement USC among the ranks of the elite.
“Having accelerated the momentum of the university and building and securing the Sample legacy and its achievements, [I want] USC to storm into the pantheon of undisputed elite universities. That’s what I would like to be my legacy,” he said.
Nikias, who has been President Steven B. Sample’s second-in-command since 2005, was considered by many to be a shoo-in for the top spot. Still, the Board of Trustees formed a search committee, which included trustees and senior faculty members, and enlisted the help of a prestigious higher education consulting firm in trying to find Sample’s successor. The committee considered 75 candidates and interviewed seven — all presidents or provosts at major universities — but in the end, the unanimous consensus was that Nikias was the right man for the job. The official announcement came March 12.
“Max is a remarkable and inspiring leader, a brilliant scholar and the best possible person to lead our university forward,” Board of Trustees Chairman Ed Roski Jr. wrote in an e-mail to students announcing the decision. “Because of what he has already accomplished at USC, and his bold and exciting vision for the future, he was the unanimous choice of the search advisory committee.”
The announcement was an exciting one for Nikias, who said he felt ready for a presidency but could only hope it would be at USC, where he has worked since 1991.
“To be a president of a private, research university is something that I felt one day I really wanted to be,” he said. “Whether it was going to be USC or somewhere else or course that you never know until the end.”
He now knows his future will be at USC, and Nikias said he could not be more excited.
“In the whole space of higher education today, this is by far the very best job,” he said.
Nikias is eager to begin is work and intends to dive right in come August 3.
“The biggest challenge is not to make the mistake and say, ‘Oh, we’re going to pause. Oh, we’re going to get some rest before we take the next step,’” he said. “But if we come in and we really accelerate the momentum … I don’t see any challenges.”
There is still some time before Nikias will get to start creating that momentum, but he said he is excited for the months to come, which he plans to use to talk to students, faculty, alumni and staff.
“It’s going to be the best time I can have at USC, these next four months,” Nikias said.
In the end though, Nikias said he’s most excited about the chance to use those conversations and ideas in his new role as president.
“To materialize the aspirations of the Trojan Family and their dreams — that’s very special,” he said.

Former USC head football coach Pete Carroll returned to Los Angeles this weekend where he commented on the current NCAA investigation of USC and his participation in the hearing earlier this February.
Carroll was in town to deliver an inspiring speech on the Santa Monica Pier to Los Angeles Marathon runners the night before their 26.2-mile run when he voiced his overall pleasure with the way the hearing concluded.
“Everything went very well,” Carroll told ESPN. “I think the university did everything they could to put all of the truth and information out there in front of the committee, and I think everyone there felt good about the process. There are still some issues that need to be determined in the next month or so, but I don’t think we could have done any better than what we did.”
Despite being busy with his new job as the head coach of the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, Carroll found time to accompany athletic director Mike Garrett and new USC football coach Lane Kiffin to the 3-day hearing in Tempe, Ariz.
A ruling for the investigation should arrive next month and could include several sanctions, but Carroll is confident that the university will be alright after the lengthy reviewing process and is glad to have been able to help out.
“It wasn’t a very difficult process, it was a just matter of validating the information that had already been turned in because we had already done everything we could do beforehand,” Carroll said. “There were some questions that the committee asked that I was glad they asked. I was glad I was there to help out because there was some stuff nobody else could have answered and nobody else could have commented on but the head football coach, so I’m glad I was there to contribute and more than anything to help the university.”

After much anticipation it appears as if the highly sought after Seantrel Henderson will be a Trojan after all.
The 6-foot-8, 340 pound Henderson, who has been considered by many analysts to be the top high school recruit, has yet to sign his letter of intent to play collegiately at USC after originally planning to do so last Thursday.
But now, according to the New York Times, the nation’s top prospective offensive lineman will sign with the Trojans as planned on Tuesday. Henderson’s father, Sean, told the Times that Henderson will sign his letter of intent on Tuesday at 2:45 P.M. CST during a ceremony at Cretin-Derham Hall High School in St. Paul, Minnesota, before subsequently faxing it to USC.
“It is USC,” said the elder Henderson in the Times article. “There’s no doubts. A hundred thousand, trillion percent, it’s USC. It’s 100 percent.”
Despite his confidence, most Trojan fans are still skeptical regarding Henderson’s commitment to the program. After all, he has still yet to sign with the Trojans even after his announcement on signing day in February when he declared that he would attend USC.
However, he chose not to sign that letter of intent until USC officials met with the NCAA infractions committee, which they did last month. Henderson now feels as if this is the opportune moment to make his USC commitment official after much delay.
“We’re over it,” Sean Henderson added in his interview with the Times.

On a quiet night when most students were returning from the rays of Cabo San Lucas or the comforts of home, three of this semester’s cinema production units gathered in Norris Theatre to showcase their work and briefly bask in the enormity of their achievements. Diverse in subject, each film was produced in CTPR 310, Intermediate Film Production, a course best known for treating students like a rock tumbler treats a hunk of granite.
“It’s a hell class!” Professor Eugene Lazarev thundered to an audience of student crews, friends and family. “This is a big, very essential step into the filmmaking world. Hell, hell, hell.”
Though the course is four units, it entails more labor and innovation than some students face in their entire college careers. Each class member is assigned a partner at random for the entire semester. Their task: to create a 16mm short film, five minutes in length, with professional actors and crew procedures. One student writes and directs while the other photographs and edits. Midway through the semester, after the film is complete, the partners switch roles and do it all again.
“Probably more than anything else, 310 is a celebration of the art of collaboration,” said Professor David Maquiling before the screenings.
The students seemed to agree, continuously thanking their partners for everything from lighting expertise to therapeutic succor.
“When I was freaking out, calling [Justyn Ah Chong] 10 times a day, he’d say ‘Relax, it’s gonna be alright,’” director Ryan Woods (’11) said of his partner.
The most common hardships of production concerned transportation. Barbara Lago, cinematographer for the Western Father/Son, was faced with getting her heavy camera and lighting equipment to the heights of Griffith Park.
“I basically had to hike two miles uphill with c-stands [rigging equipment], a tripod and more,” Lago said. “Because you can’t bring a car beyond the limits of a state park, we had no other choice.”
Director Jonathan Brebner (’11) traveled as far as the San Gabriel Mountains to capture locations for his film.
Others had to substitute familiar locales for settings, such as Cassie Brooksbank (’11), who was forced to substitute Bovard Auditorium for a pulsing rock venue in Sold Out! When Alexander Gao (’11) admitted to shooting his existential action picture around 23rd Street without a car the audience gasped.
Equally painstaking was the creation of sound, all of which was — in compliance with the terms of the assignment — recorded in the editing labs, from spoken dialogue, to the flutter of cards in Paige Cohen’s lusty poker thriller, Hold Em’. Such sounds are created by a process called Foley design, in which artists devise a way to physically create their desired audio using objects, and record it with a microphone.
While the unsavory aspects of 310 production have a habit of overshadowing matters, some students noted the surprising ease of other procedures, such as securing interesting shooting locations.
“CBS gave us great help,” said Phillips Shum (’10), who went through the company to secure permits for shooting his film. “They set us up with everything, including the metro.”
Across the board in content, the screened films were a testament to the ingenuity and adventurousness of their makers. Brebner’s Unbound featured a young man whose exception from the laws of physics influences his love life in unpredictable ways. Homeland, directed by Apo Welatparez (’11), illustrated painful chapters in the history of Kurdistan through narration, an intense chess match and flashbacks to different invasions. Shum’s Last Stop examined emotional isolation in the big city through the story of a pickpocket, entranced by a beautiful target.
Comedy was also well represented. Woods’ Jack’s Big Move featured an icy barista and her hot chocolate-guzzling, Milton-esque admirer, doomed from the first tube sock shot. Gao’s bittersweet An Internal Affair featured John Woo-inspired action sequences imagined by a video store clerk, discontent with constant demotion and timidity. Finally, junior Edwin Eversole’s A Misteak offered the thoughtful notion that stuffing a raw steak down one’s pants may not be advisable before a date.
In the Norris courtyard, the crowd convened for refreshment and good cheer, before retiring off to respective residences for the necessary wrap parties.
Still, while the filmmakers deserved their champagne interlude, it won’t be long before their cars are once again stuffed with equipment and their backs aching from long days on their feet. Such is the marathon lifestyle of a production student. But most of the students wouldn’t have it any other way.
“No matter how stressful it gets, my homework, ultimately, is to make a movie,” Lago said. “How cool is that?”
Hey Miles and Daily Trojan staff – thanks so much for a really thorough and well written article.  Being in 310 myself (was the director of Father/Son) I really appreciate you taking the time to cover this event!  All of us in 310 put a ton of work into them!

Think back to a time when you were anxiously awaiting the release of a music video.
It’s been awhile, hasn’t it?
Like the novelty of seeing a film in its theatrical release, producing visually intriguing stories set to music has been worn so thin that music videos are on the verge of becoming obsolete — similar to vinyl records, cassette tapes and compact discs.
When MTV, once a pioneering outlet for musicians, was in its glory days in the 1980s, music videos made up the bulk of the cable network’s content. But the channel’s original intent of showcasing musical artists and their precisely edited visual counterparts has evolved throughout the years, and the allotted airtime for music videos has waned in order to fit in the appropriate amount of reality television.
Similarly, MTV’s Total Request Live has suffered from music video ADD since its inception in the late 1990s, airing a meager 30 seconds of each requested video and instead acting more as a vehicle for handsome V.J.s. And though YouTube has encouraged watching music videos in their entirety, the site’s effortless accessibility and lack of discretion has enabled low-budget imitations to infiltrate the site, to the point where searches for the original video are often futile.
Who else, then, could revive the art of the music video and make it relevant again but the Fame Monster herself — Lady Gaga.
Internet message boards were abuzz with misinformed releases and screenshot leaks the weeks leading up to March 11, the official premiere date of the video for “Telephone,” Gaga’s latest electro-pop single featuring Beyoncé. The video even had The Envelope, the Los Angeles Times’ entertainment blog, giddy, writing on the day of the scheduled release, “It’s like Christmas morning here.”
The hype of this newfound diva partnership sparked with the first play of Beyoncé’s “Videophone,” a hypnotizing, R&B-tinged track that includes Gaga on guest vocals. With Beyoncé at the helm, it’s only natural that the song’s video oozed with female sexuality. But with Gaga taking the reigns and no longer playing back-up dancer to the tantalizing yet less imaginative Beyoncé, pop music enthusiasts and pop culture junkies were burning with one question: What will Lady Gaga do?
More than a week after “Telephone” was unleashed on the Internet, they are still trying to figure out what hit them.
In “Telephone,” Gaga reunited with Jonas Akerlund, the Swedish-born filmmaker who first directed the pop musician last year in her racy “Paparazzi” video. Clocking in at a lengthy 9:23 and depicting a skewed, albeit colorful, reality where female prisoners wear Diet Coke cans as hair curlers and waitresses working at grease-stained diners feature glittery headpieces, “Telephone” is the epilogue to Dadaism.
Lady Gaga is making headlines with the recent release of her video "Telephone."
It’s apparent from the video’s opening frames — various steely-hued wideshots of a dreary industrial landscape superimposed with orange and yellow bubble lettering — that this is not just any world, but the one according to Lady Gaga.
Whimsical, surreal and at times slightly disturbing, “Telephone” intercuts the standard dance montages with scripted speaking segments that form a disjointed story line grounded in themes of female empowerment, commercialism and celebrity voyeurism.
The video picks up where “Paparazzi” left off — with Gaga entering prison for the murder of her ex-lover. This continuation of a plot line from one independently made music video to another instantly makes Gaga an anomaly among her peers. It’s the references that follow, however, that make “Telephone” a phenomenon.
Once in prison — a place, in Gaga’s mind, ruled by punk-rock chicks decked out in studded leather jackets, bras and short shorts — Gaga is stripped naked save for her fishnet stockings, prompting one of the guards to say, “I told you she didn’t have a d-ck.” It’s a sneaky yet well-placed reference to those who blog about Gaga’s drag-queen tendencies, and from that point on “Telephone” plays as if it were interactive, each reference chipping away at the wall between Gaga and our computer screens.
Product placement exists in nearly every scene, from jump cuts to a Virgin Mobile cell phone, close ups on fast-food beverages, Polaroids and gas station honey buns, and Gaga cooking her poison beside loaves of Wonder Bread. As the attention to these products is much too precise to be accidental, it appears Gaga is commenting on the current state of the industry; as record sales have declined during the last decade, artists have turned to selling their tracks to companies, and it’s these advertisements that have been garnering the most revenue for musicians.
More abstractly, the scene in which Gaga and Beyoncé dance in the middle of the diner — clad in American flag-designed outfits and surrounded by the lifeless bodies of the patrons they just poisoned — can be read as a commentary on the current war.
But perhaps most intriguing is in a bout of irony, Gaga references, rehashes and remakes the filmmaker notorious for being the pastiche king, Quentin Tarantino. Not only does Gaga borrow the ostentatious Pussy Wagon, complete with its pink keychain from Kill Bill, but Beyoncé’s nickname “Honey B” is derived from Amanda Plummer’s diner-robbing “Honey Bunny” from Pulp Fiction. The use of grainy, cheaply produced television news reports and, most significantly, the outlawed lovers-on-the-run (Gaga and Beyoncé) also pays homage to the Tarantino-penned Natural Born Killers.
Of course, one could say that I’ve read a bit too much into the bizarre “Telephone,” but there lies the dilemma: Music videos are generally not meant for multiple viewings or in-depth close readings — or so we’ve been programmed to believe.
A one-time viewing of “Telephone” leads to confusion plot-wise (jail? diner? Tyrese Gibson?), and the bombardment of iconic logos initially overwhelms rather than comments. The preliminary critique of “Telephone” is that it comes off more like an extended Super Bowl commercial than a work of intersecting art.
It’s the same reaction, however, of a pair of eyes taking in Gaga at first glance: a shimmering hodgepodge of pop culture and glam rock history that went too far with its imitation.
It’s one thing to rehash the old, like Tarantino does so expertly in his films, but it’s another art form entirely to rehash the already rehashed — and to adopt it as your own mark. Although critics of Gaga contend she disguises substance with a whole lot of style, “Telephone,” as well as the woman behind it, prompts several viewings — and rightfully deserves them.
Lauren Barbato is a senior majoring in writing for screen and television. Her column, “Sound Check,” runs Tuesdays.
Lady Gaga’s song all sound the same–annoying. I agree that the video is definitely better than the music completely. And I like Beyonce better when she’s being herself than Gaga’s pet.
Indeed, it’s quite the surreal, subtext-fueled video for what is basically a mediocre piece of music. I’d rather see more of Akerland than hear more Gaga.

The band’s name might be the literal translation of the Finnish word for “computer,” but Static of the Gods’ latest release Knowledge Machine is all about life, humanity and emotion. The Boston-based trio of Jen Johnson, Mike Latulippe and Ben Voskeritchian have put together one of the best albums so far this year, but its fault lies in its lack of range of styles. Each song features a slow, melodic pace that focuses more on the female singer’s vocals than the rest of the band’s abilities.

That is not to say Knowledge Machine has a bad sound. The album is rich with powerful guitar chords and vibrant imagery. And although each song has a similar sound, there are little differences in the tracks that make each one unique and entertaining.
Most of the songs for Knowledge Machine were written by the band while on tour and at shows. The album feels very much like a road soundtrack, the kind of songs perfect for a reflective drive down the coast or through the woods. The album’s 11 tracks are introspective, tackling personal issues such as isolation, longing and emotional betrayal.
Each song feels genuine and soulful while the music is powerful and haunting. It lingers and provokes thoughts but never shocks or startles. Knowledge Machine is the kind of music that stirs the imagination, strikes up an emotion or recalls a memory.
The opening song, “Rest Your Head,” sets the mood with powerful lyrics that accompany a musical buildup from slow chords to overwhelming melodies and enveloping beats.
The follow up, “Talk You Down,” is a look into isolation and identity, told through a rich sound that builds on the first track but puts more emphasis on the bass and drums.
By the third track, “Hollow Heart,” though, the little differences in each song become more apparent. The lyrics call for independence in a relationship, and the music takes a subtle, hard-rock edge. “Church Bells” uses a catchier, electronic approach, with undertones of early-90s alternative rock. The pace really picks, however, up with “White Flag,” a guitar-driven rebellion against repetition and conformity that is the highlight of the album.
The closing song, “True North,” ties up the album perfectly, bringing together all of the themes and messages of the previous tracks. It is a culmination of the intimate, almost innocent feeling that permeates Knowledge Machine. Like “Rest Your Head,” it starts slow but builds into an impassioned call for escape from society and finding inner peace where the sun shines all the time.
While the music is definitely indie-rock, Knowledge Machine avoids would-be pop-culture references that have invaded the genre. Instead, it goes to the basics of human emotion and relationships. The closest comparison to the band’s sound would be local band Silversun Pickups, but Static of the Gods puts more of an emphasis on vocal power.
Johnson’s vocals are the driving force of Static of the Gods’ sound. The lyrics are smart and full of vivid imagery, and she has a strong, rich voice that haunts the songs. Her singing on “Mean Streak” is the best on the album and cements her as one of the best female singers in rock.
The lyrics in Knowledge Machine do not fade away but instead linger on, blending seamlessly into the music. Latulippe and Voskeritchian, with Johnson’s guitar playing, complement the vocals and never come across as background filler the way other bands’ instruments sometimes do.
With its relaxing music and introspective lyrics, Knowledge Machine is a captivating album. It is a refreshing take on indie-rock, one that doesn’t try to be edgy or rebellious for the sake of going against the mainstream, instead focusing on its sound first and foremost. Static of the Gods crafted an album far more enjoyable than those of its major-label cousins, and it should garner the band some well-deserved popularity.
Awesome review. Is there anywhere where I can find the album streaming?

It’s not often that you hear about good hip-hop from Latin America.
Despite the genre’s immense popularity in the United States, it hasn’t yet become mainstream in many other countries, possibly because of cultural and language barriers. But when a good hip-hop artist does emerge from an underground Latin scene it happens with a bang, as is the case with Chilean emcee and recording artist Anita Tijoux.
Tijoux was born in France to a French mother and a Chilean father living in political exile during Agusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. After the fall of Pinochet and the return of democracy in the early 1990s, Tijoux moved back to her father’s homeland, where she began her career as a rapper.
“I was born in France, but I always felt as a Chilean,” Tijoux said in a phone interview.
Growing up in France, Tijoux was exposed to many significant hip-hop acts, some more underground than others.
“Some of the artists I grew up playing with and listening to included Bubaseta, Movimiento Original and Guerrillero Oculto,” Tijoux said.
More recently, Tijoux has worked with Argentine electronic tango act Bajofondo (which features renowned producer Gustavo Santaolalla), Mexican hip-hop icons Control Machete and Chilean beat master DJ Bitman. But it was her collaboration with Mexican rock star Julieta Venegas — who came to USC in 2009 for an exclusive concert in Bovard Auditorium — on the track “Eres Para Mi” that helped expose Tijoux to a mass audience — the song became a hit.
Tijoux recently signed a deal in the United States with Latin alternative label Nacional Records to distribute her 2009 album 1977, where Tijoux worked to prove to the world that she was a true rapper.
After spending some time rapping in more pop-oriented collaborations, Anita returns to her roots with 1977. Lyrically, the album — its title derived from the year of Tijoux’s birth — is a time warp back to Tijoux’s roots in France.
Exploring themes as diverse as the death of a close friend and the anguish of creative crises, 1977 takes Tijoux back to her origins as both a musician and an individual. After years of sharing the spotlight with her original band Makiza, collaborating with other artists and trying to find her way as a solo artist, Tijoux finally consolidates herself as a mature and talented emcee with 1977.
Although Tijoux’s melodic voice might at first seem out of place in a rap, her hypnotic vocals — in addition to her rapping skills and dynamic beats — are what makes 1977 an album worth listening to.
More intriguingly, Tijoux sings and raps in both French and Spanish. The multilingual aspect of her live shows is perhaps one of the most memorable things about an Anita Tijoux performance.
After a very successful outing at this year’s South By SouthWest Music festival in Austin, Texas last week, Tijoux will have her long-awaited Los Angeles live debut tonight at Little Temple with Cypress Hill member Eric Bobo to continue with her first North American tour.
Tijoux said she is thrilled to be playing in the United States and expanding as an artist internationally.
“I’m very excited,” Tijoux said. “It’s exhilarating to make new fans and get people that want to listen to my music.”
After the disaster that struck Chile less than a month ago, Tijoux is happy to leave the country for a while, although she said her heart will stay with her family and home country.
Last year was a big year for Tijoux not only because of the Chilean release of 1977 but also because she experienced tremendous growth in other markets. She performed in Mexico’s biggest rock festival, Vive Latino, last summer and was one of the most surprising acts of the festival.
Latin hip-hop is well represented with the music of Anita Tijoux. It’s also interesting to see a female succeeding in a genre typically dominated by males. Women in Latin rock have had a fairly positive impact on music. Artists like Julieta Venegas, Ely Guerra, Ceci Bastida, Javiera Mena, Natalia Lafourcade and even Ximena Sarinana have proven that females have a strong voice in hip-hop and are as good as men.

Spring break was no break at all for the USC baseball team, as they played a packed set of games against strong opponents.
Tapped · Sophomore pitcher Chad Smith gets the start today. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans played seven road games over the break, flying across the ocean to take on Hawai’i and traveled to Northern California where they faced off with Pacific. USC went 4-3 and evened its season record at 10-10.
Coming away with a winning record after such a long road trip might seem like a positive. But USC coach Chad Kreuter said a poll of the players and coaches would return a different answer.
“They’d say it was disappointing [to go 4-3],” Kreuter said. “It looks good for a road record on paper, but we gave away the first game at Hawai’i and didn’t pitch or execute as well as we needed to.”
After taking three of four from the Rainbows, USC dropped the first two games at Pacific before bouncing back Sunday with its largest offensive output of the season, scoring 15 runs and knocking 21 hits.
Freshman Cade Kreuter started the onslaught in the second inning when he hit his first of two home runs. He finished the week batting .409 (9-22) to boost his average to a robust .360 — best among full-time starters.
Sophomores Matt Foat and Ricky Oropesa also hit home runs Sunday. Foat had a big game going 2-4 with five RBI while Oropesa’s home run was the culmination of a stellar week.
In his last five games, the left-handed hitting sophomore has batted .600 (12-20) with three home runs, four doubles and nine RBI — recording RBI in all five games.
With a solid relief effort allowing two runs in 4.1 innings, sophomore Brandon Garcia picked up the victory Sunday. Garcia’s effort was emblematic of the team’s last six games — when the relief pitching was solid, the team won.
In the March 12 series opener against Hawai’i, USC blew a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the seventh inning when it committed three errors. Sophomore starting pitcher Andrew Triggs didn’t help his cause committing two of them. The bullpen then allowed four runs the following inning to give the Rainbows an 8-2 victory.
The Trojans took the next three games from Hawai’i, only allowing three runs and while winning 3-1, 12-2 and 9-0.
Sophomore Ben Mount pitched his first complete game March 13, allowing one run on five hits and striking out eight. The following day, senior Kevin Couture pitched five innings to pick up the win while juniors Chris Mezger and Logan Odom threw four scoreless innings allowing only one hit.
In the series finale, sophomore Chad Smith, senior Shuhei Fujiya and Garcia combined for the best pitching performance of the season — zero runs, three hits, 11 strikeouts.
The team hoped to carry its success into the weekend series against Pacific but struggled from the mound. Triggs gave up six runs, Mount allowed four runs, the Tigers got to Couture for seven runs and the bullpen combined to surrender six runs in eight innings.
Only Garcia’s relief performance and the offensive outburst on Sunday saved USC from being swept.
Kreuter said the team’s pitching struggles are all very similar.
“In the seventh or eighth inning, we give up runs in bunches,” Kreuter said. “It’s usually just one pitch. Something like a 1-2 breaking ball that we hang instead of getting in the dirt.”
“The guys did a really good job of correcting that in Hawaii,” he said. “We’re heading in the right direction. We’ve just got to get over that hump and learn from those mistakes.”
The Trojans will look to carry momentum from Sunday’s 15-9 win as they host Pepperdine at 6:30 p.m. tonight in their final tune-up game before the conference schedule begins this weekend.
After his strong outing last Monday against Hawai’i, Smith will get the start.
“Spring break was no break at all for the USC baseball team”…in HAWAII…where the girls’ team also went and only had to play scrimmages. Hmm…sounds like a terrible break!

The USC track and field team hurdled over the competition at Saturday’s Trojan Invitational at Loker Stadium, the team’s only true home meet of the 2010 season.
The Trojans won all four hurdle races, giving them the top team marks both nationally and collegiately, in a performance that USC coach Ron Allice hopes is just the start of a season filled with record-setting efforts.
“The times we ran are certainly times we thought we were capable of,” Allice said. “We hope that it’s just the beginning and that we can keep improving into May and June.”
When asked if his hurdlers can do better, Allice without hesitation said,  “Absolutely.”
They  have tough marks to top. Junior Oscar Spurlock highlighted USC’s dominating showing with a victory in the men’s 110-meter high hurdles, posting a time of 13.83 that currently stands as the fastest in the world.
Not to be outdone, freshman standout Reggie Wyatt posted the best U.S. time and the seventh best in the world in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles with a 50.91, nearly a second and a half faster than the second place finisher.
The USC men weren’t the only group who posted nationally ranked times on Saturday. Senior hurdler Shalina Clarke won the women’s 100-meter hurdles with a time of 13.69 seconds, slightly slower her nation-leading time of 13.41 set last week. Additionally, sophomore Dalilah Muhammad added her name to the world rankings with a 58.50 in the women’s 400-meter intermediate hurdles, besting marquee Texas hurdler Angele Cooper.
The hurdlers were joined on Saturday by several other strong performers from USC’s other events. Senior sprinter Ahmad Rashad, the second place finisher in the men’s 100-meter dash at last year’s NCAA championships, won Saturday’s 100-meter with a time of 10.61, a mark all the more impressive considering the 1.5 meters per second headwind.
“That’s a pedestrian time for Ahmad, absolutely,” Allice said. “I was more impressed with the fact that he did everything technically correct. A win is a win, though.”
Rashad was also part of the men’s 4×100-meter relay team, which made its season debut Saturday without any signs of rust, winning with a time of 41.01 seconds.
The USC distance squad also made its presence known with a handful of fine races. Junior Zsofia Erdelyi won the women’s 3000-meter race with a personal best time of 9:27.96 in her first race of the 2010 season.
Also making his mark was sophomore Blake Shaw, who ran USC’s first ever sub four-minute mile during the indoor season. On Saturday Shaw ran a personal best 3:47.49 in the men’s 1500-meter, placing second in the race but moving him to seventh all time in Trojans history for the event.
Despite all the gaudy numbers, however, Allice says his team’s focus remains on the weeks ahead, specifically this weekend’s Stanford Invitational.
“Overall, I was pleased; I thought our people competed,” Allice said. “But I think people get too wrapped up in marks and times. At this stage in the game, we’re still focused on next week and also a month, two months from now.”

The No. 3 USC men’s tennis team ended its two-match spring break trip to the East Coast on a high note after suffering an early setback.
Fighter · Senior Robert Farah suffered a back injury over the break, but was still able to help the Trojans capture a 4-2 victory over Georgia. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
In their final match before Pac-10 play begins in earnest, the Trojans (14-2, 0-0) displayed championship-caliber play in their 4-2 victory at No. 6 Georgia (13-3, 0-0) Friday, according to USC coach Peter Smith.
The USC victory ended Georgia’s 71-match home winning streak.
Senior Robert Farah played valiantly while overcoming a back injury — suffered earlier during the break — to dominate a doubles match with sophomore Steve Johnson and clinch the match with a three-set singles triumph over Georgia’s No. 96 Nate Schnugg.
“Robert played hurt the whole match,” Smith said, according to USCTrojans.com. “For Rob to do what he did while hurt really shows his spirit and what a leader he is.”
Georgia will host the NCAA championships in May, and gaining confidence on these courts while beating a potential national title contender provided a boost for USC.
Two days earlier, USC suffered its second loss of the season, falling 4-3 at Duke (6-5, 0-0).
As was the case in their other loss against No. 5 Texas, the Trojans lost the doubles point to Duke and were not able to overcome the early deficit.
Injuries were again a factor in the match, as Farah did not play singles and sophomore Matt Kecki was out for the weekend with a shoulder injury, but Smith did not want to take away from Duke’s strong performance.
“Duke had great play in doubles and No. 1 singles,” Smith said. “We gave it our best without Rob and Kecki, but it wasn’t enough.”
Smith described the loss at Duke as a big upset but explained that playing high-quality road matches is important to prepare the team for later in the season when the stakes are much greater.
“I am never afraid to lose a match; my goal is to put the team in tough situations to see how they respond,” Smith said. “We are not going to learn from easy matches. We have to build toughness, and the match against Duke — although it was a loss — was a step in that direction.”
One of the highlights of the trip was sophomore Daniel Nguyen‘s continued strong play. He won all four of his matches without dropping a set.
Playing talented teams like Duke and Georgia during a break might not be advantageous in the short run, but these types of matches are crucial in building the tenacity necessary to compete for championships.
“In a lot of ways, we have everything to lose and nothing to gain on paper,” Smith said of the decision to schedule Duke and Georgia during the break.
The experience from these quality road matches is crucial — especially for first-year players like freshman JT Sundling and junior Peter Lucassen — so that inexperienced players will be prepared for the pressure of the Pac-10 season and beyond.
With the Trojans’ first official Pac-10 match scheduled this weekend at No. 65 Oregon (11-4, 0-0), the main concern is getting everyone healthy, especially recently injured Farah and Kecki.
The way the Trojans responded in a tough environment at Georgia, especially following the loss at Duke, proved that they are prepared as the Pac-10 season commences this weekend.

The weekend of March 13 — the first weekend of USC’s spring break — reports of increased violence in Mexico prompted a travel warning from the federal government but did not seem to stop students from heading south of the border to popular spring break destinations.
South of the border · Three people associated with the American Consulate were killed the first weekend of spring break, but that did not stop students from traveling to Mexico. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
Three people affiliated with the U.S. Consulate were shot and killed that weekend in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. In Acapulco, a common vacation destination, 17 people were killed. The violence is a result of competition among drug cartels, and drug-related deaths have been an ongoing problem in Mexico.
Because of the recent deaths, the Department of State issued a travel warning March 14 to inform U.S. citizens traveling to Mexico of the security concerns facing the country. The warning urges visitors to stay in well-known tourist areas, leave an itinerary with someone not traveling with them, avoid traveling alone and check with cell phone carriers to ensure coverage prior to departure.
Yet reports of the violence running rampant throughout the country seemed to have little impact on students who viewed Mexico as the ideal spring break destination.
“We’ve always wanted to do the stereotypical college spring break in Mexico,” Allison Bierly, a senior majoring in communication, wrote in an e-mail. Bierly spent the week in Cabo San Lucas. “My friend had a timeshare there, so we got to stay for free.”
USC students received an e-mail from Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, about a month before spring break began. The e-mail encouraged students to register their trips online and referred those traveling to Mexico to the Department of State’s publication, “Spring Break in Mexico: Know Before You Go!”
“We’ve had students stopped, students arrested, students get into fights,” Jackson said. “With all these drug wars going on, we want to make sure that people don’t get caught up in these things inadvertently.”
Jackson said he faced harassment from the Mexican police two years ago while on vacation with his family. He said officers tried to force him to pay a bribe after he was pulled over and accused of speeding.
His advice to students spending their break in Mexico: “Don’t drink too much. Don’t go to places that you’re unfamiliar with. Stay with your friends. Don’t seek out illicit drugs. Use common sense, and stay out of seedy bars.”
Michelle Tsang, a senior majoring in communication and psychology, said that the school e-mail made her more concerned about her trip. She decided that a cruise with friends through Cabo San Lucas and Ensenada was a safer alternative to planning a trip on her own.
“Even though the excursions planned by the cruise were more expensive, we opted to do those — instead of the twenty dollar snorkeling or thirty dollar parasailing trips that were offered by locals promoting on the street, which could be dangerous,” Tsang wrote in an e-mail.
Violence in Mexico is widely acknowledged to be on the rise, despite efforts by the Mexican government to minimize crimes related to drug trafficking.
Pamela Starr, associate professor and director of the US-Mexico Network@USC, said violence is most prevalent along the drug transshipment routes, over which two cartel alliances are fighting to control. This area includes Juárez, Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo along the border, the Chihuahua, Durango and Sinaloa regions, and Acapulco.
Starr went on to say that violence is never intentionally directed at tourists, although a lot of innocent civilians are increasingly targeted by mistake or get caught in the crossfire in extremely violent cities.
Students seemed to feel that as long as they used common sense while traveling, they would not fall victim to the violence and crime in Mexico.
“I was confident that where we were staying was pretty safe,” Melissa Ingraham, a senior majoring in communication, wrote in an e-mail. “[In Cabo San Lucas], we were highly condensed with other college students, so I knew that if we acted responsibly we would be fine.”
Ingraham also made sure to keep in close contact with her parents, a tactic that was strongly recommended in the Department of State’s spring break guide.
“My parents were worried, but I made sure to constantly update them. It reassured them that I was OK,” Ingraham wrote.
Though many students took the travel warnings with a grain of salt, some parents took the alerts much more seriously.
“One of our friends did not end up going on the trip because her parents were too worried that it wasn’t safe,” Bierly wrote.
Though reports of violence in Mexico are broadcast daily, it appears the country’s popularity as a spring break destination — much like the crime rate — is not decreasing.

The No. 9 USC women’s swimming and diving team spent its spring break racing against the best of the best during the 2010 NCAA championships at Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind., from Wednesday to Saturday.
The women finished strong, posting a seventh place overall finish.
“We nearly achieved our goal for this year, which was to make top five,” senior co-captain Dina Hegazy said. “We got top seven, which was still amazing.”
The Women of Troy had six All-American (top-eight) finishes: juniors Presley Bard and Lyndsay DePaul, sophomores Katinka Hosszu and Victoria Ishimatsu, and freshmen Haley Anderson and Jessica Schmitt. All of the women besides Anderson and Schmitt were All-Americans in 2009.
DePaul was the top qualifier in the 100-yard butterfly going into the final, with a time of 51.67, breaking the school record in the event for the third time in a month. In the final, DePaul fought for first place until the last inch, where she was out-touched by Stanford’s Elaine Breeden (51.43) and finished second with a time of 51.72.
Hosszu became the first Trojan to earn back-to-back All-American honors in the 400-yard individual medley since Kaitlin Sandeno in 2002-2004. After taking second place in this event last year, Hozzsu touched third in the final with a time of 4:03.65. Stanford’s Julia Smit, the American record holder in the event, came first (4:00.90).
In the 200-yard butterfly, the Women of Troy sported two women in the final and two in the consolation final: Hosszu and DePaul made the final, ranking second and third.
Hosszu and DePaul took second and third respectively. Breeden once again claimed first in the butterfly and touched in 1:52.39, with Hosszu finishing at 1:52.52. DePaul touched shortly after for third in a personal-best 1:53.19.
“The butterfly races were really fun to watch,” Bard said.
Anderson just missed out on a medal by finishing fourth in the 1650-yard freestyle with a time of 15:59.99, breaking her personal best of 16:02.53.
“I think that [the] freshmen really stepped it up, especially Haley,” Bard said. “To make top eight as a freshman is a really big deal.”
Ishimatsu became USC’s first two-time All-American diver since Blythe Hartley in 2006. She took fourth on three-meter and fifth on one-meter. Freshman Ariel Rittenhouse scored her first NCAA individual points by finishing fourth in the three-meter consolation final (12th overall).
After an exciting week, the Women of Troy hang up their suits after another long, but progressive, season. It will be the last time this group of women swims as a team before they welcome their new freshmen teammates in the fall. There is no doubt, however, among any of them that, with such a young team, this is only the beginning.
“Throughout the whole meet, all we kept talking about was next year, neat year,” Bard said. “Watching the top-four teams, and watching them battling it out for first place — I can’t wait to be in the mix of that next year.”

While the rest of campus was on spring break, the No. 21 USC women’s tennis team pounded out a dominant 6-1 win over Fresno State Wednesday afternoon at Marks Stadium.
After losing the doubles point five times in its last eight matches, USC gained the momentum by snagging the doubles point over Fresno State.
Trend setter · Freshman Danielle Lao’s easy 8-1 victory set the tone for the USC’s bounceback win over Fresno State on Wednesday. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
The No. 2 USC duo of sophomore Alison Ramos and freshman Danielle Lao set the tone with an easy victory, 8-1. The other two doubles matches were a lot closer but ended in USC’s favor, both at 8-6.
Then, up 1-0 heading into singles, USC orchestrated a string of straight-set singles wins, enabling the Women of Troy (9-6) to rack up wins in five of their six singles matches rather quickly.
At the top spot in singles for USC, nationally ranked No. 3 junior Maria Sanchez tallied in her 13th singles win of the season by upending her Fresno State opponent, 6-0, 6-1.
Meanwhile, Fresno State freshman Julia Gragera-Cano defeated USC junior Lyndsay Kinstler for the Bulldogs’ only point of the day. Gragera-Cano won the first set 6-3 and was ahead 3-0 in the second when Kinstler retired.
Up 2-1, USC didn’t let its momentum waver. USC senior Sarah Fansler defeated her opponent on court five, 6-1, 6-3. On court three, No. 32 Lao powered a 6-3, 6-2 victory to seal the match win for USC.
The day ended as No. 82 freshman Valeria Pulido finished her opponent on court four, 6-0, 6-4, as did No. 20 Ramos with a 6-1, 6-3 win.
The victory was a much-needed win for the Women of Troy who were upset by Arizona State just days before the USC dueled the Bulldogs on March 13.
Against ASU, USC barely came away with the doubles point winning matches on court two, 9-7, and on court three, 8-6. The No. 40 nationally ranked duo for USC, Sanchez and Pulido, fell 8-5 to ASU.
Even with the doubles point in hand, USC couldn’t keep up with ASU during singles action. ASU won the first two singles matches to get ahead of the Women of Troy 2-1.
But then it was USC’s turn to take the lead.
Ramos held strong on court two for a 6-1, 0-6, 6-3 win over ASU’s Nadia Abdala, locking the score at 2-2.
At the No. 1 singles spot, Sanchez pulled off a comeback win over ASU’s junior Micaela Hein. Sanchez outshined her opponent, taking a 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 win, putting USC ahead 3-2, leaving battles at the No. 3 and No. 4 positions.
On court four, USC’s Pulido was edged out in a nail-biter of a match. Pulido took the first set 7-5 but couldn’t put away her opponent in the second, falling 4-6. The match ended in a third-set tiebreaker in ASU’s favor.
With the match tied 3-3, this left the decider on court three in a close battle between Lao and ASU’s No. 102 Kelcy McKenna. This was the second time this season that the deciding match was in Lao’s court.
But in the back-and-forth, hard-fought battle, it was McKenna who was able to clinch the match for the Sun Devils with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 win.
This was the first time this season that USC won the doubles point but did not come away with the match.
“The doubles point is a really important point,” Sanchez said. “We are going to continue to make doubles one of our main focuses in practice for the remainder of the season.”
The Women of Troy might go with a different look in their doubles pairings.
“Our team is thinking of switching the doubles positions, maybe at the No.1 and No. 2 spots, but nothing is finalized yet,” Lao said.
Following USC’s loss, the Women of Troy’s team ranking fell from No. 13 to No. 21, while ASU rose from No. 32 to No. 18.
“Everyone is getting healthy and recovering from their injuries now, so I’m very hopeful that we will perform much better from here on out,” Ramos said. “The past losses have just made us hungrier.”
The Women of Troy have the week off but have a pair of matches set for the weekend against Washington and Washington State at Marks Stadium.

Many fans, myself included, feel the Women of Troy were snubbed last Monday when the NCAA selection committee did not pick the USC women’s basketball team to compete in the NCAA tournament.
The team should have made it to the tournament for many reasons.
It ended the regular season hot, riding a five-game win streak to a 19-12 record, USC’s best finish since its 19-12 record in 2006, the last time the Women of Troy made an NCAA tournament appearance.
Ten teams USC played against made it into the tournament field, so the team clearly had a tough schedule. USC won four of those games. Also, USC’s 12-6 Pac-10 finish this season was its best since 2004-05.
Additionally, the Women of Troy advanced to the semifinals in the Pac-10 tournament, only to lose a 59-53 nail-biter to No. 23 UCLA, a No. 8 seed in the tournament.
The women’s basketball team, and many USC fans for that matter, had every reason to be surprised when on selection Monday, March 15, the committee decided not to include USC in NCAA tournament competition.
I understand the feeling of shock.
“I was in awe when the last name came up and it wasn’t us,” sophomore guard Ashley Corral said.
I sensed bitterness.
“I can’t tell you why the Pac-10 doesn’t get a lot of respect,” Corral added.
To give up? That’s something that doesn’t sit well with me.
Unfortunately, that’s exactly what the Women of Troy decided to do when they declined an invitation to play in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament following the news that they wouldn’t be in the NCAA tournament.
The athletes and coach Michael Cooper had every right to be angry and upset about the committee’s decision, but what would have been the greatest revenge? How could USC have proved it belonged in the tournament that all college basketball players dream of being a part of without actually competing in it?
Easy.
The Women of Troy could have accepted their invitation to the WNIT and won.
No, a WNIT championship would not have been the same as an NCAA championship, but a dominating USC run in its tournament could have opened the eyes of the selection committee and brought some recognition to USC women’s basketball. And maybe next year, if USC is teetering on the edge of making the NCAA tournament again, the committee would side in favor of USC after recalling the team’s success in this year’s WNIT.
Now there’s no chance that can happen.
Also, playing in some pressure-packed games, albeit not on the biggest of stages, would still help the young players on the team deal with adversity in the future if the team actually does make it into the NCAA tournament in the next few seasons.
But, USC never had the chance to prove it was better than any of the teams that made it or didn’t make it to the big tourney after the team declined to play in the WNIT.
Rather than demonstrate why they deserved to play for a national title, the Women of Troy simply gave up, which isn’t the way any USC team should end its season.
Could you imagine if the football team, after a disappointing 2009 season where it lost four games and did not play in a major BCS bowl for the first time since 2001, decided not to play in the Emerald Bowl because it felt it deserved to play in something better?
I didn’t think so.
And I’m sure the USC men’s basketball team would have died to play in any game after the regular season, even if it was in the NIT, but it didn’t have any say in the matter.
Playing in the post-season in any sport at the college level should be thrilling, even if it is in what many people consider the “loser’s” bracket.
At USC, we expect our athletic teams to always be the best and compete with the best, but if a team doesn’t get the results it wants, it should never just stop playing, no matter how upset or disappointed it feels.
Even more alarming is this isn’t the first time the women’s basketball team has decided to decline an invitation to the WNIT after not making the NCAA tournament.
But I sure hope it’s the last.

OK….So its really funny that once again I am reading an article in the DT that is false. I wish I could say this was my first time. But just about everytime, the article is wrong and the details within do not even match the story. It’s pretty clear that the writer of this article has never played a collegiate sport and doesn’t like to do thier research at all. Good luck getting a real job when you can not even get the details right for a simple school newspaper. 
Just like Sara B said, the team generally never has any input in whether or not they will be participating in post season play. You would know that if you actually did some sort of research. Mike Garrett decides this and makes the choice on post season play. The men’s team shouldn’t even be broughten up in this article because they have nothing to do with our women’s team. Who knows what Garrett would have said when they did’t make the NCAA tournament this year. We do not know because it is not up to the athletes. 
I really hope that one of these days I can look and read a sports article in the DT and actually be able to trust the facts written within. I’m not going to hold my breath on that thought….but who knows. Maybe we will find a couple writers that actually know what they are talking about and are willing to take the time to get correct details.
Goodluck with actually writing a correct article…..Hopefully I see it before I graduate….very doubtful though!!
Dear Jon and Steve B.,
 I agree that it could have been good for the Women of Troy to prove they belonged in the NCAA tourney by competing in the WNIT, and they really were snubbed by not getting picked for NCAAs. However, I think you should do a little more research before you say that the Women of Troy “gave up” at the end of their season.
First of all, it is not the girls’ decision whether or not they accept the bid. That is up to Mike Garrett and the coaching staff. I bet if you asked any of the players if they wanted to extend their season and have a chance to win the WNIT, they would eagerly say yes. Therefore, I think it is harsh and unfair for you to imply that they are quitters.
Also, if you look into it and don’t just assume that they “gave up,” you could possibly find several good reasons for the Women of Troy to turn down the bid to the WNIT. Since you clearly didn’t have the time to do that, let me help you out. For one, playing in any tournament is very costly, and with the budget cuts perhaps the athletic administration didn’t think it was worth it. Another reason is the risk of injury – the team has already struggled through numerous ACL tears, and those types of injuries are more likely at the end of the season when your body is worn out. It could be a good idea for the players to take some time to let their bodies recover so they can come back even stronger for next season.
The bottom line is, the women of troy did not “give up” and in hearing that I felt like I was reading an article out of a UCLA paper. Next time I hope you will try to discern both sides of the situation, and not portray the women of troy in such and undeserved negative light.
My sentiments almost precisely. There is no good reason not to have accepted a bid to the WNIT and show others including themselves that they can compete strongly outside the conference. This program has done really nothing for many years (13 ) except two 1st round wins in the ncaa under Coach Trakh in his first two years. Stop being prim a donnas and show your merits on the court.

A comeback bid by the USC women’s basketball team fell short Saturday against UCLA in the semifinals of the Pac-10 tournament. USC (19-12, 11-7) bowed out of the tournament with a 59-53 loss to its crosstown rival.
Two free throws by junior center Kari LaPlante with six minutes remaining helped the Women of Troy grab their first lead since the opening minutes at 50-49. USC would push the lead to 53-51 moments later on a 3-pointer by senior guard Heather Oliver before UCLA closed the game on an 8-0 run.

“Tough losses like this hurt, but they only make you a better team, and we’ve learned from some things we didn’t do tonight to make us a better team in the future,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
USC had an opportunity to win late in the game but gave up an offensive rebound on a missed free throw. UCLA forward Markel Walker grabbed her own missed shot with 30 seconds left and got the ball to teammate Doreena Campbell, who extended the lead to 57-53 with a pair of free throws.
USC sophomore guard Ashley Corral missed a 3-pointer on the next possession.
The Women of Troy battled all the way back from a double-digit deficit but were unable to overcome an ice-cold shooting start. USC made just three of 16 3-pointers and shot 28 percent overall in the first half.
“We’ve [been] shooting like that all year,” Cooper said. “I wasn’t concerned because it was early and usually we’re pretty good in the second half.”
The Women of Troy trailed 30-24 at halftime but stormed back in the first four minutes of the second half to tie the game up at 34. From there the lead seesawed until the final minute.
After the game, Corral expressed disappointment at the loss.
“They didn’t really do much to make us lose,” Corral said. “It was just things we had control over such as hitting open shots, making layups, boxing out.”
Corral led USC with 15 points on five 3-pointers. Senior forward Aarika Hughes added 12 points and six rebounds for the Women of Troy.
In their opening game against Oregon, the Women of Troy rode a 9-0 run in the second half to an 80-76 victory.
Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath, who earned Pac-10 Co-Defender of the Year honors last week, keyed the run with seven points and a huge blocked shot. USC trailed 64-59 before going on the run.
Oregon drew within one at 72-71 on a pair of free throws by guard Micaela Cocks before USC senior guard Hailey Dunham came up with a clutch play.
Dunham tracked down a missed free throw by Hughes and dived out of bounds to save the ball, knocking over two computer monitors in the process. The extra possession ended in a 3-pointer at the shot clock buzzer by Corral.
Redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos made four pressure-packed free throws after that to seal the win for USC.
Gilbreath led USC with 19 points and seven rebounds. LaPlante knocked down her first seven shots en route to 15 points and six rebounds. Corral added 16 points and six rebounds.
Following their semifinal exit from the Pac-10 tournament, the Women of Troy waited for last week’s selection Monday to see whether they had made the NCAA tournament.
The Women of Troy were not selected to the 64-team tournament and declined an invitation to the Women’s National Invitational Tournament early last week, ending USC’s season.

Just when it seemed like it had snapped out of its midseason funk after winning two matches in a row, the USC men’s volleyball team hit another bump in the road over spring break.

The No. 7 Trojans were swept in back-to-back matches at No. 4 Brigham Young University on Friday and Saturday to extend their losing streak to three matches and their losing streak to BYU in Provo, Utah, to 13 matches.
The Cougars (14-7, 10-6) had little problem dispatching the Trojans (10-9, 8-8) on Saturday, as they won in straight sets 30-25, 30-23, 30-23.
USC never posed much of a threat in any of those three sets. The closest the Trojans got in the first set was 8-8, until a serving error and a Cougar block gave BYU a 10-8 lead it never relinquished. The second set was a little closer, as the score was tied at 17 before a BYU kill and block gave it the two-point cushion it needed.
Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy led the Trojans with 13 kills, while junior Tri Bourne, returning to the starting lineup these last two games at the libero position, had nine digs.
But the match of the weekend came the night before in the first match between USC and BYU.
In a tight contest from the start, the Cougars outlasted the Trojans in four sets, 33-31, 35-37, 33-31, 30-21.
USC actually had a firm grip on the first set, a set they now haven’t won in 12 matches, holding a 27-24 lead. But the Cougars reeled off three straight points to tie the game, and after the score reached a 31-31 tie, the Trojans did themselves in, as a USC hitting error and serving error gave BYU the set.
Yet, typical of the Trojan team this season, it didn’t give up, rallying to take the second set in dramatic fashion.
Facing four set points down 29-25, freshman outside hitter Maddison McKibbin hit a kill, then served up an ace to save two set points before a BYU hitting error and a Trojan block tied the game at 29. The score would remain within one point until Troy recorded a kill and BYU had a hitting error to give the Trojans the second set.
BYU, however, refused to yield momentum to the Trojans, as it jumped out to a 22-17 lead in the third set before USC went on a 8-2 run to get a one point lead at 25-24. But the Trojans couldn’t close the set out as, like in the first set, they hindered themselves with consecutive hitting errors at 31-31 to give BYU a 2-1 lead.
The fourth set was never really competitive. The Cougars jumped out to a 12-6 lead and hit .393 en route to the nine-point win and the 3-1 win for the match.
Despite the loss, several Trojans stood out: Troy, McKibbin and sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli recorded double-digit kills, while McKibbin and junior middle blocker Austin Zahn combined for 11 blocks.
The Ship is sinking.

Yuan Tao, a sophomore majoring in psychology, clutched a carton of eggs as she perused the refrigerated section at Superior Grocers in the University Village.
A resident of Webb Tower, she sometimes finds the time to cook, spending about $100 a month to do so. But as she adjusted the eggs in the crook of her elbow while shopping on a Sunday afternoon, she revealed the other thing in her arms: a Subway sandwich.
“I’m there basically everyday,” she said. “I eat out a lot — I’m just too lazy to make my own food.”
She didn’t know how much she spent on food she bought ready-made — but conceded that in doing so, she lived a much more expensive lifestyle. The groceries she did choose to buy appeared purely complementary — eggs, vegetables and milk were part of her monthly purchase, as were snacks such as chips and ice cream.
College, though meant to be a time of personal growth and intellectual stimulation, can lead students down the path of cheap sugary snacks and packaged food or vending machine items hastily purchased in between classes.
Students simply don’t know how to spend money on food mindfully and economically and instead waste money and time on convenience buys — many of which are unnecessary snacks — that can often have negative effects on their physical and financial health.
For class, students often look for on-the-go, portable treats loaded with carbohydrates and sodium — or eschew healthier, fresh fruit options for pantry items they can stock on their shelves.
Many students like Tao, however, skip the whole mess and buy food from outside vendors, often not keeping track of the money spent on such items.
Even students who make an effort to stay home for meals and save money have trouble quantifying and remembering the food they eat.
Ralphs shopper Alexis Dirvin, a sophomore majoring in architecture, estimated that she and her three roommates spend about $200 to $400 a month on groceries. Her roommate Josanta Gray, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, agreed.
“We make stuff you can make in large quantities,” Gray said. “We make spaghetti, rice and red beans, a lot of Mexican food.”
“Oh, we make a lot of chicken too. And cake,” Dirvin said.
On-campus options, when presented, made students wince for a variety of reasons.
“Eating on campus is just too expensive,” said Victor Garcia, a graduate student studying film production, waiting for deli service at Ralphs.
Estimating that he spends about $300 to $400 a month on groceries, Garcia also added that he needed to eat out at casual restaurants because of his busy schedule. His job in Century City makes it easier for him to eat at establishments such as Pink Taco — even if he did cook.
Garcia said he was satisfied with the food prices and options near USC, calling them “pretty decent.” He expressed interest, however, in possibly having a warehouse shopping option close to campus.

“It would be nice to have a Costco around,” he said.
On any given Sunday, student shoppers can be seen stuffing items such as soda, potato chips, frozen pizza rolls and candy into their shopping carts instead of more healthy items that can serve as both snacks and components of meals, even though these more bang-for-your-buck items can often be the same price, if not cheaper, than their convenient counterparts.
Grocery stores are definitely not immune to the convenience bug. The first smell that wafts into shoppers’ noses as they enter Ralphs? The undeniable, pervasive scent of fried chicken meals ready to be devoured, sitting pretty in their plastic containers underneath heat lamps. This first display is right next to other convenient snacks: chips, sodas and baked goods — all devoid of any nutritional value.
At Superior, a two-ounce carton of Goldfish crackers costs 99 cents, and three pounds of carrots cost $1. At Ralphs, that same 99 cents can get you almost two pounds of bananas and a pound of navel oranges.
For a single meal, ingredients for taco salad can stretch for multiple meals: Two cups of Ralphs brand cheese, a head of Earthbound organic lettuce, red on vine tomatoes and three pounds of lean ground beef might add up to $12.76 without tax but can provide a variety of meal choices for multiple days.
A quick $3 drive-through taco will deliver one tiny meal with lots of sodium and a strong possibility of heartburn.
What’s worse is that what used to be eaten as meals has become food for mid-morning or mid-afternoon snacks. Drive-through lines at McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Del Taco all spike in between lunch and dinner; the line at Panda Express is notoriously long after midnight.
Students, as a demographic, have adopted high-calorie meals as unhealthy and expensive meal options.
Many students don’t realize how much of a price they really pay for their convenience habit. Whether it’s that $5 footlong or that handful of candy from the vending machine in Taper Hall, those little pit stops add up. Eating a Subway sandwich each day comes out to spending around $150 a month — and that’s not even including the drink and the bag of chips.
Or the 15 pounds.

With the House of Representatives approving legislation key to health care reform on Sunday, President Barack Obama claimed a major victory for his presidency, thereby proving himself to be a strong leader capable of accomplishing his goals despite heavy criticism.
John Park | Daily Trojan
But it certainly wasn’t easy.
While it is true that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic congressional leaders played a large part in gaining necessary support for the bill, Obama himself led the charge to gather support from America. In particular, he turned to the demographic that came out in full force to help him win the election in 2008: young adults, especially students.
Once again Obama asked his supporters to make phone calls and send e-mails to their respective congressional representatives. By using his already extensive base of students from the presidential election, he was able to mobilize many to reach out to other citizens about health care reform.
But Obama didn’t stop there as he took the health care battle to the Republicans’ home turf — the radio waves. Obama mobilized his base of loyal supporters to call various conservative radio shows and offer viewers their opinion of the health care reform package.
Obama also set up a page for radio on his website similar to the phone banking page he created during the presidential election in which millions of calls were placed by regular citizens across the country all while sitting at their desks.
On this website supporters were able to find a radio show and its phone number, and were provided a script to follow while on air. The process itself was very simple, and the hope was that many supporters of Obama’s health care package would be willing to do some on-the-air campaigning and defend his policy against conservative leaders.
Obama made a good strategic decision by going after conservatives in their own arena, and in doing so also proved there is still a large number of people who are willing to campaign and spread his policies to others on his behalf.
Conservative talk radio remains a key part of the conservative political base. Thousands of people listen to their favorite conservative radio hosts, such as Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin and Sean Hannity, blast liberals and give their opinions on the news of the day. Limbaugh along with Levin, Hannity and other conservative radio shows, are seen as heroes in the eyes of many American conservatives. Many political analysts go even further and claim conservative talk radio is the heart of the conservative movement and Republican Party.
In creating his web page, Obama hoped to re-energize his youth base that helped him during the Democratic primaries and general election in 2008. Young people were especially helpful in turning out votes on university campuses and going into the surrounding areas and registering people to vote. This demographic would be the best option to take on conservatives on the radio because they are the most energized — and, one could argue, the most optimistic as seen in 2008.
Let’s make it clear that Obama isn’t done using his base to spread his health care message. The coming months will be key in determining whether or not his health care plan will be considered a success.
The polls currently show that a majority of Americans opposed his bill, and it will be very important to see if those people change their minds after seeing the bill’s benefits. Some experts predict that for these people, perhaps just knowing they can keep their health care plans without the entire system collapsing might be enough to sway their opinions.
Many opponents of Obama’s health care plan were acting on the fear spread by Republican politicians who claimed the bill would bring drastic and negative changes to all Americans with or without health care — a claim that Obama has said is false.
Obama must keep his support base mobilized and ready to continue making phone calls to citizens and radio shows.
Without a strong show of support for the bill over the next couple months, a midterm defeat for the Democrats is possible — a defeat that could lead to Republican control of both the Senate and House.
If Obama cannot convince and show the American people that the bill is beneficial, and instead loses Democratic control of Congress, he will face difficulty passing other legislation.
He is already looking into a comprehensive bill to reform the educational system and is also working on an environmental bill. It goes without saying that without Democratic majorities in both the Senate and House, it will be very difficult — if not impossible — for him to lead other comprehensive reform efforts on controversial topics.

Diane, if I’ve swallowed liberal platitudes, then your post is nothing but a regurgitation of republican ones. It’s clear we’re not going to change each other’s minds, but I will say this: my generation is driven by documented, growing consciousness of social justice and diplomacy. The rest of the West has put these measures into policy, so why not follow? If these values  are “just stupid” in your book, then you must be a deeply unhappy person, or just plain selfish.
Hey Heinrich, go back and read Joe’s first post here. In fact, read all of his posts here. You are clearly in need of an education, as you have swallowed numerous liberal misconceptions. 
The reason we have a financial problem in this country is all about SPENDING, which Democrats do with absolute impunity (as evidenced by this “health care” disaster-of-a-bill). GOP has often been guilty of going along for the expensive ride. Only one group seems interested in getting us back on track, and the added bonus is that they also want to protect our individual liberties. That would be your conservative/libertarian types — the polar opposite, Heinrich, of Obama and his sheep. 
Your understanding of Wall Street is pathetic. Tell me, who do those “fat cats” contribute to, mostly? The records are very clear. Democrats and their buddies on Wall Street get “bailed out” — because they’ve greased the palms of the Democrats in power. Furthermore, the economy is “wrecked” in large part due to the insane policies instituted by Democrats that encouraged/forced mortgage companies to give bad loans to people who had no business getting loans (that would be in the name of “fairness”). So much liberal lunacy, so little time to go over it all. But Heinrich, you know nothing of what you speak. You are merely repeated liberal platitudes. Government — the FEDERAL government — is a big part of why health care is a problem in the first place. My gosh are you blind? Look what Medicare has done to the health care business. Look what Social Security has done with our money (where is it, anyway?)… 
Your comment about slashing education shows exactly the problem with your mindset. Probably educated in our public school system, you were never taught what the Constitution provides for… and WHAT IT DOES NOT. The federal government shouldn’t have anything to do with education! Things are worse now than when Carter started the Dept of Ed… why not just dismantle it? So you see, there are intelligent, legitimate ideas that you apparently have never wrapped your brain around. It’s all just “bad GOP wants to slash education.” 
That’s simple-minded, obtuse, and sad in a student here at USC. Joe’s right. Your generation, if they continue to embrace these policies, is just stupid. Your future is one of enormous, burdensome taxes, a nanny state, big brother government, and decreased personal liberty. That sound “a lot more optimal” to you?
Jack, the Bush administration was no more “responsible for the wars” than FDR was responsible for World War II. Winning the war was, and still is, the responsibility of the federal government. Furthermore, no one praises Bush’s failure on domestic policy and deficits. Yet, compared to what came after — Obama’s tripling of the deficit, massive expansion of the debt, with trillion-dollar deficits projected INDEFINITELY — Bush seems in retrospect like a modern day Benjamin Franklin. Obama has increased the debt in 14 months by more than Bush did in eight years, and he has done it while destroying employment, especially for the young, and saddling you with new taxes and entitlement burdens, none of which you will ever see a benefit from.
Joe,
I am going to repeat a simple sentence, copied and pasted, from what you wrote-
“And when they themselves get older, they get the added pleasure of paying off the national debt that the past couple generations have run up faster and faster for decades.”
A good deal of that national debt arising from the George Bush administration in power from 2000-2008, which was responsible for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which cost a trillion dollars.
Well Diane, I suppose young people like myself are “flocking like sheep” to Obama because unlike our last president, he has continuously voiced and demonstrated his commitment to bettering the existence of all American citizens, including students. 
Tell me, who is going to be paying the lion’s share of the deficit that Bush and Cheney accumulated through their illegal wars and tax cuts? Who is going to have the worst time finding work due to the blind eye Republicans turned to Wall Street as they gambled with the livelihoods of millions and wrecked our economy? Is it surprising that many young people support Obama, as Republican lawmakers attempt to slash the budgets for education and placate the insurance companies whose premiums force many of us to neglect necessary medical attention?
Given your insulting dismissal of young people and our legitimate concerns, I can only assume you are considerably older. Believe me, the future prospects for your generation was a lot more optimal than ours before Obama won the presidency.
I do support winning the wars. The alternative to winning wars is losing wars. The war is not a luxury that we chose, something we can simply opt out of and somebody else (Mom and Dad?) will take care of it for us. Winning wars is the duty, the reason, for a federal government.
Obamacare, on the other hand, is an unfunded welfare program whose sole purpose is to screw over the young and healthy in order to benefit the Baby Boom, the “me” generation, the most liberal generation in American history, a rotten cohort whose sole contributions to the world in their lifetimes are abortion and debt. I know you don’t get it now, you probably think this is all about “helping” people, because you’re a kid. I believe it was Winston Churchill who said, if you’re not a liberal at 20, you’re heartless, and if you’re not a conservative by 30, you’re brainless. Five or ten years from now, when you start to understand the adult world, is when the bills are really going to kick in. Hence my comment “congratulations, stupid”.
John,
While you have a good point, it is safe to assume based on many posts John has made on political articles that he is a supporter of the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am not simply assuming because he’s anti-health care bill he’s pro-war.
Jack,
Did Joe mention the money being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan as justified? I for one am against both the high cost of the health bill and the two wars we are currently fighting. Don’t assume that everyone follows the exact same mindset as party leaders.
Joe,
Is it possible the national debt has also increased due to the what? Trillion plus $ spent in Iraq and Afghanistan? Oh wait…. those are justified. Whoops.
What really blows my mind is how quickly and eagerly the young and stupid have signed on to cheerlead for Obama. A recent poll I read showed that the ONLY demographic that supports Obamacare is the 20-29 group. And yet the young are EXACTLY the group that are punished most by this bill. The basic premise of Obamacare is to force young, healthy people to buy unnecessary insurance at extremely high rates (as opposed to the cheap insurance they can buy today) — or face being thrown in jail — all for the purpose of transferring their money to the aging Baby Boomers. And when they themselves get older, they get the added pleasure of paying off the national debt that the past couple generations have run up faster and faster for decades.
Congratulations, stupid.
Obama can count on young people because most of them, educated in our public school system, are unable to critically analyze issues, and instead flock like sheep to whatever cause seems “coolest.” 
The fact that young Mr. Singh has apparently swallowed the Kool-aid proves my point.
The fact that there are so many overwhelming reasons why the American public does not support this bill (which make no mistake, was rammed down our throats with much backroom dealing and other shenanigans) apparently escapes our young editorial writer. 
So, Angad, Obama says the GOP claim that this bill will bring drastic and negative change is a false claim? How would you know? Did you read the bill? Did you run the numbers? Nobody in their right mind thinks this is financially feasible, not to mention the loss of personal liberty inherent in the whole concept. 
What’s more, our president is a LIAR. This has been proven over and over again. Do you remember when he said any bill that crossed his desk would be available to the public for five days so they could review it before he signed it? It’s on video, my friend. Now get out your little calculator and your calendar, and figure out how long it’s been since the bill passed. He’s signing it now, as I write this. 
So… why should we believe Obama’s claim that this bill is NOT going to do great damage? He has absolutely not trustworthiness left, and only the very most mindless sheep are still following blindly, bleating all the way. That’s you, Mr. Singh. For gods sake wake up already.
