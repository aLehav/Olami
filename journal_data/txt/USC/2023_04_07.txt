Since its 2022 release, “Everything Everywhere All At Once” has been a topic of conversation in Hollywood on account of its originality, creativity and ability to captivate its audience with the universal themes of family, love and acceptance. At the heart of the story is the relationship between Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) and Joy Wang/Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu). Hsu’s Oscar-nominated performance conveyed the complexity of being a queer, Chinese American woman against the backdrop of a colossal and entertaining multiverse-sized plot. 
Bovard Auditorium buzzed Wednesday with excitement and anticipation before “A Conversation with Stephanie Hsu” began. Students were eager to see Hsu, as they admired her nuanced and masterful performances. The event was co-sponsored by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and USC Speakers Committee and had a great turnout as a line formed as early as 4:30 p.m. from Bovard all the way down to Taper Hall. 
Hsu has also won a SAG Award (Best Ensemble) for her work as Mei Lin in “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Her roles have not been limited to film and television: Hsu has also portrayed Karen the Computer in “The SpongeBob Musical” and Christine Canigula in “Be More Chill” on Broadway. She is set to appear in various upcoming projects such as “American Born Chinese,” directed by Lucy Liu and Destin Daniel Cretton, as well as “Joy Ride,” directed by Adele Lim. 
“To be able to engage with Stephanie, learn about her journey, learn about obstacles she’s had to overcome and how she’s been able to find her voice as an APIDA artist is important for the APIDA community here at USC,” said Emma Hsu, one of APASA’s co-directors and coordinators of the event and a senior majoring in applied and computational mathematics.
Emma Hsu said that APASA expected the event to be packed because they had received an overwhelming amount of RSVPs on EngageSC. 
“I am really excited to meet her in person,” said Juan Garcia, a Ph.D. student studying electrical engineering. “I am really fond of her work after seeing her in ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once,’ and I’m also excited because she’s appearing in her next film, ‘Joy Ride.’”
Students patiently waited in line, some standing, others sitting on the floor, as plentiful conversations about the impact of Hsu’s work could be heard. The energy and enthusiasm culminated in Hsu’s arrival via golf cart as audience members clapped and yelled with excitement.
As the crowd rolled into Bovard Auditorium, the environment was electric and filled with anticipation. Emma Hsu and APASA’s other co-director, Sophia Lu, introduced the two moderators of the night, Sea Gira and Justin Wang. 
Shortly after, Stephanie Hsu’s entrance was met with thundering applause as she waved to the crowd of students. As she admired a packed Bovard, Hsu told the audience that she felt inspired already.
Hsu spoke about the humble beginnings of her career. Her time and experience in experimental, downtown theater in New York helped her see why she wanted to be an actress. Experimental theater helped Hsu recognize that she loved making things with people she loved. 
The conversation then segued into the “elephant in the room,” as cleverly put by Wang, thus turning the conversation toward her experience in “Everything Everywhere All At Once.” When speaking about the awards season success of the film, Hsu said that the film’s accomplishments will be solidified in history until the end of time. “Everything Everywhere All At Once”’s trailblazing successes will positively impact future APIDA representation in Hollywood. Hsu added that the film’s vision encapsulated so much of what she wants to see from the world and art.
Emma Hsu echoed this as she said, “Stephanie Hsu, APIDA-identifying people in the film industry are, you know, spearheading the wave for more Asian, more APIDA representation.”
Stephanie Hsu shared that playing Joy taught her that there are so many people, like herself, that experience intergenerational trauma. Her words were met with vehement applause as she continued and said that having that knowledge makes her, as a creator, feel as if she is not alone.
Hsu also touched on the harmful stereotypes about the APIDA community. She spoke about the toll of the silent and model minority tropes and detailed the way in which “Everything Everywhere All At Once” was able to combat these stereotypes through portraying honest family dynamics. The intergenerational aspect of “Everything Everywhere All At Once” was crucial as Hsu praised the third generation element of the film’s family dynamic, referencing the important role of Gong Gong, played by James Hong.
Esther Jung, a sophomore majoring in psychology, discussed the impact of these stereotypes, “There isn’t much realistic representation of the Asian community, which I feel like also aids to the biases that we see a lot in society, so I was really excited to see [Hsu] and hear her own personal insight.” 
Hsu’s portrayal of Joy Wang, a young, queer Chinese American woman, transformed her into an icon. Hsu said she observed that as a result of this film, there has been a circle of intergenerational healing. Hsu’s powerful statement that she hopes Hollywood will one day get to a place where everybody is queer and rainbow was met with a roar of applause and cheers. 
She imagined the ideal Hollywood environment, one that still must be cultivated, in which differences do not have to be re-emphasized in order to make sure the APIDA community is heard. Hsu said it is important to move the needle forward by creating impactful stories that combat stereotypes and break down barriers. 
The sentimentality and personal impact that “Everything Everywhere All At Once” has had on audiences was discussed as Hsu praised the feeling of belonging and acceptance that the film has inspired. She refuted the ease with which people are told that their dreams are impossible or unattainable by presenting her own experience as evidence that people can achieve their aspirations.

On the corner of Melrose and Sweetzer Avenues sits a posh, dimly lit restaurant that is the quintessential spot for a classy Friday night dinner. The cozy booths and crisp tablecloths create the atmosphere of an upscale Los Angeles restaurant. In a unique twist, it’s 100% plant-based. 
If you are an avid burger eater, don’t get scared away. Crossroads Kitchen doesn’t serve bland salads and grassy-flavored greens. Instead, menu items burst with flavor and delicacy. 
The only downside of the restaurant is the sometimes small portions for high prices, such as the $18 Cheese Plate and $32 Eggplant Skirt Steak. However, it is worth a try next time you feel like treating yourself, mainly because the entree’s prices compare to those at a nice steakhouse or seafood restaurant. 
Still, based on the restaurant’s aesthetic Instagram page and notable reputation within the plant-based community, I decided to try it. 
Starting with the perfect Poached Pear & Whipped Feta appetizer, I was immediately blown away. The bed of whipped feta and bleu cheese was creamy and tasted identical to its dairy counterparts. Pears, grapes, celery and chives sat on the non-dairy cheese, covered with a sweet drizzle on top. The salty cheese and sweet toppings complemented the appetizer’s fresh sourdough toast. 
I could not get enough of Crossroads’ artisan almond-based cheeses, so I had to order its signature Cheese Plate. With Camembert-bleu, Boursin and quince paste, the appetizer did not disappoint. The tangy cheeses spread on the side of a baguette transported me to France with each bite. This is a great choice if you’re looking to sample a variety of cheeses. 
Moving on to salads, I tried the Baby Beet and Ceasar. Although the Baby Beet was topped with a delicious feta and balsamic, I was disappointed by the smaller portion compared to other salads on the menu. The salad did not have lettuce, which should be specified on the menu, but it’s a good option for beet fanatics who want a whole plate of multicolored roots. The Caesar salad was impeccable, with crunchy croutons, the softest parmesan, and a rich dressing. 
As a pasta devotee, I tasted the Spaghetti Carbonara, Linguine Scallops, Spicy Rigatoni Vodka and Lasagna Bolognese (from most to least favorite). The spaghetti carbonara was unique, with an all plant-based blend of juicy egg yolk, creamy white cheese sauce, and smoky pork bits. The Linguine Scallops were a close second with its zesty white wine garlic butter sauce and perfectly sauteed mushroom scallops. The Spicy Rigatoni Vodka was also great, mainly because of the perfectly fluffy parmesan. While there was nothing wrong with the lasagna bolognese, it did not compare to the other pastas. 
The Scallopini Parmesan was the only item I tasted from the protein section. It was a sizable and crispy piece of plant protein chicken with a fresh marinara sauce and amazing parmesan. 
The Truffle Mushroom Bianca pizza was a solid 10 out of 10. The pizza’s truffle flavor is very prominent in every bite and is perfect for my fellow truffle aficionados. 
Another, more affordable way to taste Crossroads’ imported truffles is through its truffle potatoes on the vegetable menu. These square-cut potatoes topped with fresh thyme and shaved parmesan were among the crispiest potatoes I have ever tasted. For a lighter option, roasted cauliflower is another excellent vegetable choice. However, I would avoid the Rockefeller style Baked Mushroom Scallops, which were too tender and briney for my liking. 
If you have room for dessert, try the Brownie Sundae and the Sorbet of the Day, which were delicious. But, seeing some of the other eclectic desserts making their way to nearby tables, I concluded that they all looked delectable.
As a longtime plant-based restaurant enthusiast, I can confidently say that Crossroads is one of the classiest and most delicious restaurants I have been to. It differentiates itself from other plant-based restaurants by mimicking the atmosphere of a traditional ornamental restaurant. Only some days do you find a vegan restaurant offering such upscale dining and high-quality ingredients.

President Carol Folt announced Tuesday the appointment of Andrew Guzman as USC’s next provost. Currently dean of the Gould School of Law and interim dean of USC Libraries, Guzman will be the first Latine to serve as USC’s provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. 
His appointment follows Charles Zukoski’s abrupt resignation from the position last November, after which interim Provost Elizabeth Graddy held the post while the Provost Search Committee looked for a permanent successor. In her announcement of the appointment, reached after months of deliberation, Folt praised Guzman’s legacy of “prioritizing academic excellence” and having “led the recruitment of renowned interdisciplinary legal scholars.”
Guzman sat down for a joint media briefing with the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media Wednesday to discuss his vision for the provostship, and the importance of diversity and inclusion for both students and faculty. In remarks before student media questions, Guzman said he was “just really excited by the opportunity,” especially at a University whose ability to “engage in excellence at scale” puts it in a unique position in higher education.
“There are lots of terrific universities in this country, and there are lots of large universities in this country. But USC is unusual in its ability to be both at the same time,” Guzman said. “That’s attractive to me … because scale means impact, right? The number of students we produce, [that] graduate every year — that’s not the only measure, but that’s an obvious one — the amount of research we do.”
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Annenberg Media: You are filling the shoes of Charles Zukoski, who was the last provost of three years. What relationship do you have with him? And what, specifically, do you plan to do differently?
Andrew Guzman: I know him pretty well, because I was a dean under him, and the dean and the provost work very closely. I don’t really want to draw a contrast between what I’m going to do and what he’s going to do, but I’m happy to talk about things I would like to do.
One of the ways to describe the role of the provost — or at least part of the role of the provost — is: There’s all these different schools, and the provost’s job is to support each of the deans so that their school can thrive. That’s easier because I already have a relationship with some of them. I know pretty well what the main challenges their schools are; For others, it won’t be hard for me to learn from them. So, that’s one element.
The other thing that I want to focus on, which is more reflective of the way I think about these leadership roles: It’s important to always have a way to make sure I’m thinking of longer-term projects. In my current role as dean — but even more so in the role of provost — you can be consumed by things that have short-term deadlines. And that seems urgent, and you’ve got to get all that stuff done. But you have to lift up your eyes and make sure you’re thinking about what needs to get done in a year, or in five years, because that’s one of the ways progress is made.
Daily Trojan: You are the first Latine to serve in this position; could you speak a little to the significance of this milestone?
AG: It’s important for all the reasons one would expect. If USC is going to thrive on, let’s say, a horizon of 20 or 30 years, we know that the student population is going to be even more [Latine] than it is now. California is a very [Latine] state, the population within the country is growing — the demographics are clear. So these demographic trends have to be part of the University strategy going forward.
I also think there’s some symbolic meaning to it. As we have an increasingly diverse everything — that is to say, student body, staff, faculty, the academic leadership, leadership on the staff side — as those populations become more diverse, the places they go from there become more diverse. So, a more diverse faculty cohort leads to a more diverse dean cohort leads to more of a likelihood of having a provost who’s from minority groups. 
But I want to be clear. I’m Latino by any definition: My father’s Dominican, I speak Spanish. But I also don’t present as Latino to most people, and that has implications for the way I’ve encountered society. And I don’t want to misrepresent the set of experiences I’ve had. Sometimes, people see me, and they think, “He’s Latino?” And they find that odd. I do look unusual; I’m ethnically not typical. But if I was in Chile or Argentina or Panama, I wouldn’t look particularly different from anyone else.
DT: The Daily Trojan has done some independent research on the faculty demographics here at USC, and we found it skews heavily towards white male professors. The diversity of our student bodies seems to not necessarily be reflected in the faculty. To give you some numbers: 6% of students, as of the 2021-22 academic year, are Black, while only 3% of tenured faculty are Black. 16% of students are Hispanic/Latine, while only 5% of tenured faculty are Hispanic/Latine. Did you have any specific plans to hire more diverse faculty in the future?
AG: The University has been focused on this for a while. I think it was last year — that’s not a solid dating — there was a large fund of $50 million made available to support the hiring of faculty that contribute to diversity. That fund has been renewed. So, it was used up, and “used up” means it was spent in the recruiting of faculty that add to diversity. So, that’s been a theme for some time, and it’s important that we keep making progress on that.
There’s an inherent challenge, which I do not present as an excuse or apology, because faculty don’t turn over very quickly. So, one of the challenges that’s been worked on, and that I plan to continue to work on, is how do you accelerate that? You can’t double the size of the faculty, which would be one way to solve that problem. But what other options are there to make that change happen faster and in an effective way? And faculty hiring happens in a decentralized way; It happens in the schools or sometimes at the department level. How do you influence that, so that you can get that demographic change of the faculty accelerated? That’s not an easy problem. But it’s a really important one that we continue to work on.

I have over a hundred playlists, so you could say I enjoy listening to music. I, of course, have my favorites, but none of them felt like the right thing to talk about when considering my focus for this column. 
There are too many options and trains of consciousness to choose from. As I wrap up the last month of my college career, there are too many things I am feeling. I ran through artists that have stuck with me throughout my life — Lauryn Hill, Lana Del Rey, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs — and considered talking about Bay Area legends. I’m going to have to talk about Kehlani at some point.
But still, nothing felt like the right thing to say. 
I am not here in my retired “Sex, Drugs & Spotify” columnist fashion, but I am here with my heart on my sleeve and guts spewed about nonetheless. Words are typically my solace. But, the most drastic of times — like when you have your whole life in front of you with no idea of your next move — call for inspiration. 
There are times when we need something else to speak for us because we can’t muster up the courage. It’s hard to tell someone how you feel when you don’t even understand it yourself. 
So, how do you capture the voice of a person who stammers and vents, follows tangents, does not seem to know their own mind or their next step, and loves but does not always appear to like themself? 
You make a playlist. 
One of my favorite TV shows of all time is a quick 10 episode remake of the 2000s movie, “High Fidelity,” starring Zoë Kravitz. Though it was ultimately canceled to my bewilderment, that single season remains one of my favorite shows to revisit. 
The series captures the delicate and artful practice of making a playlist and understands that they speak more eloquently than any edited article ever could. 
“It’s like writing a love letter, but better, in a way. You get to say what you want to say, without actually saying it,” Kravitz tells the camera in the first episode. 
For someone who struggles with verbal sentiments and hardly ever musters the courage to relish in the ooey-gooeyness of relationships, I really understood this. To not have to find the right order of words but still share all that is running through my head by stringing together a couple of songs has saved me more times than I can count. 
I’ve spent hours on my bedroom floor in the middle of the night parsing through albums and songs trying to find the one that fits. Good things take time. 
The best ones tell a complicated story in a concise manner. They capture a moment and make it everlasting and able to be revisited. (I spend a lot of time in the past, transcending myself to moments I miss or with people I mourn). They’re versatile and vivid. 
My “Dana Coffee Grind” playlist was one of my first favorites, and it was specifically to be enjoyed with one of my best friends in high school as we studied in the Dana Street Roasting Company cafe. 
My “eyes breath hips” one transports me to one of the best nights of my life at the concert I went to for Halloween one year. “junebug” reflects the time when I last felt the most inspired and reignites a spark within me every time I listen. My “i love February” one from last year is my best one and remains something of which I’m proud. 
The playlist I listen to the most, though, wasn’t even curated by me; it was a gift. 
Making and sharing playlists is one of the most intimate exchanges we have in this day and age. It brings you into someone’s mind and fits you into their skin and holds you tight when you’re far away. It ties you to one another and serves as a beautiful way to connect. 
I’ve fallen in love over curated playlists. I’ve found myself in curated playlists.
They say that journaling lets you work out your thoughts and figure out what you’re truly feeling. This has never worked for me. My “journaling” has always presented as playlist curation, and I’d say it suffices. 
Using someone else’s poetry to help me figure out what I resonate with has made a lot more sense than coming up with words I don’t even know yet. It speaks for me when I can’t, and, ironically, that is a feat I struggle with constantly. 
There is very little that I know of as per the future. But, there is far less that I am worried about because I know that a curated playlist somewhere will help me along the way.

If you’re anything like me (and for your sake, I hope you’re not), you’ll find yourself counting down the weeks. “I’ve got midterms this week, so I just gotta survive till the weekend.” “One more paper due and then I can breathe.” “One more project –” But how many “one-more’s” can I get through? How many “one-more” weeks, “one-more” assignments? I can’t seem to remember when my days started to blur together. The days of my life have been reduced to nothing more than “one-more’s.” And when it feels like you’re drowning and you can’t breathe, spring break comes along and it’s suddenly “one more week until spring break.” Then, it seems manageable. But all I want to do is to go home.
It doesn’t take a spider bite (although I have been bit by a spider before — it just sent me to the hospital) to recognize the heroic feat that is a first-generation student leaving home for college. Even if you aren’t first-generation, college is a daunting journey, one that is the beginning of our so-called “adult lives.” But, God, do I need an adult. Because it seems like every day, I am barely managing to get by. Barely remembering to eat enough meals (intermittent fasting or eating disorder?). Barely remembering important due dates. Barely remembering to breathe. When I do take a breath, it seems like ages before I can muster up the courage and motivation to get back into the rise and grind. Because I simply do not want to be rising and grinding anymore. Chasing a bag is a full-time job, and that’s on top of being a full-time student.
I am fortunate enough to be able to go home. My humble home in San Jose next to the taqueria and Burger King with the hella good fries. I hope there are more neighborhoods next to a taqueria and Burger King because, if not, I just doxxed myself.
And so I go to the airport. Meet my parents and come home to gỏi cuốn cá hấp, spring rolls with steamed whitefish. A nice change of pace from the Vietnamese restaurants around campus that serve unextraordinary spring rolls with pork belly and shrimp. That’s not even considering the ones that market their egg rolls as spring rolls (criminal!). So, as I change and unpack my bags in what is now a shell of my childhood bedroom, I enjoy a nice mom-made dinner and catch up with my parents. And the feeling hits.
I’m not really home.
My bedroom is stripped bare of the trinkets and knick knacks that give it personality. The things I own that proudly exclaim, “I was here!” My parents are older, more weathered. They tell me about how work is going, the good and the bad. How family politics are rapidly changing (always for the worst). The city I grew up in looks different. The stores I found myself frequenting have closed. Local businesses come in and out of existence, and everything that wasn’t cemented into the ground was turned into a new parking structure (God bless America). The worst of all? The expanded bike lanes on the side of the road that now cover half of the streets. Because who the fuck rides bikes in the hood?
Throughout that week of break, it seems that time goes by for everyone else. Everyone but me. My parents have their 9-to-5’s. My high school friends are away at college (since USC’s break doesn’t seem to align with any other school in the country). My friends at USC are either in Los Angeles or Cabo (the duality of man). So I find myself in a house that’s no longer a home. With nothing but my cat that bites and the month of lectures that I swore I’d watch over break.
In a desperate attempt to make the most of the break, I found myself driving to Fremont for a night, meeting with my high school best friend and chronically online best friend — a compromise between San Jose and Berkeley. I’d pour my heart out, catching them up on all the things and people that have wronged me, and they, the same. I find myself uttering the words, “I want to go home,” before catching myself. “I mean I want to go back to L.A.” But why was it that I felt that way? I guess somewhere along the years, I found a place to call home in L.A. And as much as I love hating on L.A., I actually — wait for it — have friends here. Crazy, right?
So, I find that home is no longer a physical location. It isn’t a place with four walls. Home is now an idea, an abstract. Home is where I find myself at peace. Home is eating dinner with family. It’s getting coffee with friends. It’s doing the things you want with the people you love. And, lately, I find myself lost in thought, looking for moments where I can be at home.

“You’re going back to school for another two years?!” is what our parents said when we told them we got accepted to USC for the master of social work program. It’s safe to say our parents did not understand our desire to obtain a higher degree.
Many first-generation students decide to return to school after receiving their bachelor’s degree to get their master’s for better pay and to expand their education. While they want the best for us, many immigrant parents are not involved in their child’s school environment and don’t fully comprehend the stressors we have to endure. Those who come to the United States and immediately join the labor force tend to have lower levels of educational attainment, thus any sort of college degree is foreign to them.
According to the Public Policy Institute of California, a large share of immigrants work in industries that require little formal education, “accounting for 75% of California workers with less than a high school degree.”
Graduate students juggle many different responsibilities. For example, both of us are full-time students, complete at least 16 hours of internship hours weekly, work part-time jobs and still manage our personal lives — often without our parents’ full support. Any attempt to explain our work in higher education tends to result in confusion that leaves us disheartened. The issue lies in when and how immigrant parents are involved in our lives.
Latine parents need to be involved in the graduate student’s journey from the start. Parents who are low-income, not fluent in English, undocumented, lack financial aid or loan knowledge and misunderstand college life suffer from the informational gap in graduate students’ education.
A survey of 50 college access and parent involvement programs in California found that these programs were the main source of college information for those attending, yet the colleges failed to make an effort to involve immigrant parents.
Many colleges and universities have centers for first-generation students. These centers improve the student experience and help students feel like they have a sense of belonging.
USC’s First Generation Plus Success Center provides support and resources not only to first-generation students but also undocumented, former foster youth and transfer students. Some services promote student engagement through opportunities on campus to gain deeper interactions with their peers and professors. This allows students to talk about similar experiences in social, emotional and academic situations — all of which we greatly appreciate. However, the center is intended for students and not parents.
Santa Ana College in Orange County, on the other hand, is very involved with Latine families and students. Its program, Padres Promotores, is made up of student workers who conduct outreach to parents of future and current college students. The mission is to inspire, transform and empower families to achieve higher education.
The program holds an annual event, “Camino de Amistad,” meaning “Road to Friendship.” The event helps parents learn about college life and how they can prepare their children for college by offering parent information sessions. Some topics discussed include the vernacular of college, financial aid and scholarship opportunities, transfer center information and student services programs.
Padres Promotores is doing what USC should be doing for its Latine graduate students, their families and immigrant families in general.
Expanding networking opportunities and the Trojan community with USC’s graduate programs and immigrant families can drastically change graduate students’ lives both on campus and at home. Hosting events throughout the school year to get families participating in their child’s education can provide a sense of community between all parents and students — not just parents who have the resources to do it on their own.
The University should host family orientations with professors at the beginning of the year to get families familiarized with their child’s peers and educators, and to involve them in their academic life. Building this sense of community can help parents understand the amount of pressure and workload students face in higher education.
The disconnect between the importance of being in a graduate program from a prestigious school and our parents’ lack of understanding of our sacrifices hasn’t been noticed from either side. All we want is for our parents to understand that, even though we’re working on a path that might be foreign to them, our efforts aren’t meaningless.

“Take a deep inhale through the nose. Long exhale through the mouth.”
Perched upon a yoga mat for her Thursday afternoon lesson, Lauren Ross slid effortlessly into the next position. She encouraged her six students to do the same, but at their own pace. Warm light diffused into the empty room through tall windows, and the scent of lemongrass and calm music hung thick in the air.
“Even in moments of challenge, or tension, we bring ourselves to our awareness, to our breath, and use our breath as a vessel for relaxation, for ease,” Ross said.
Compared to other, wealthier regions in Los Angeles, South Central has a distinct lack of yoga spaces — particularly those that welcome people of color, people of all body types and LGBTQIA+ people. The goal of The Tree Yoga Cooperative, a Black, Indigenous and people of color-owned studio on 60th St., is to change that. 
“I’d only seen white women, thinner frames,” said Meketta Renee Ridgle, a regular at the Tree who has attended for at least four years. “But coming here was a reminder that [yoga] is for all bodies, and I definitely feel that.”
This need for a welcoming space led Raja Michelle to start the studio in 2013, then called the Green Tree Yoga Meditation Foundation. For seven years, the Tree continued its mission in relative peace and stability. 
Once the coronavirus pandemic hit, however, financial difficulties led Michelle to eventually dissolve the nonprofit. In the immediate aftermath, she stepped away from leadership of the Tree and from teaching yoga entirely. The Green Tree closed down in March 2020, and the volunteers sold everything inside at a yard sale. They earned $600.
Later that year, in August, some former volunteers at the Tree found small opportunities to continue teaching yoga in South Central. They taught virtual classes to a business that had employees who were burnt out due to the pandemic. L.A. City Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson hired the Tree to teach yoga at local parks.
“Little by little, we’re like, ‘Okay, we have enough money to make shirts. Let’s do that. We have enough money to get fliers out to different places,’” said co-owner Rita Ortiz-Contreras. “And little by little, it just started happening until we were like, okay, it’s time. We got to look into a place to move into.”
In June 2022, the Tree, renamed the Tree Yoga Cooperative, reopened at a new location in the Beehive, a multi-building complex of community-oriented small businesses. Its founders — Ortiz-Contreras, Jonie Cole Thomas, Jenni Alvarez and Jana Johnson — would continue the work they started at The Green Tree nearly 10 years before as volunteers.
The Tree offers a variety of different classes focused on topics such as breathwork, restoration, healing and meditation. While some classes cost a fixed price, the Tree also offers donation-based classes where students pay what they can to make yoga more affordable for the community.
Desirae Cole, an attendee of the Tree for a few months, said that through the Tree she learned “the spiritualism that comes with meditation: the slowing down and giving gratitude.”
“Even in [today’s class], we thanked ourselves for being here,” Cole said. “Just holding space for gratitude collectively is a really good feeling.”
Additionally, the Tree hosts events such as a monthly sound bath, workshops on Kemetic yoga or Toltec philosophy and Black Liberation Week — a collection of free classes and workshops focused both on yoga and the concept of liberation — that has taken place annually for the past two years. The latter event, in particular, stems from Ortiz-Contreras’ belief that yoga and social justice are inseparable.
“Yoga without social justice for me now is just like, ‘Wait, what? Why?’” Ortiz-Contreras said. “Why would you do yoga and not understand the social justice part of it? Because a lot of our community members have been impacted with racial discrimination.” 
Although yoga is a practice that originated in ancient India, the Tree has expanded its philosophy to include teachings from other ancient societies, such as the Toltec civilization from South America and the ancient Egyptian civilization in Africa.
“We’re Black and brown people,” Ortiz-Contreras said. “All these different philosophies from all these ancient cultures just mirror yoga. So the best thing is that you get Indus Valley yoga, you get Toltec philosophy, you get Kemetic [Ancient Egyptian] philosophy, and everyone can relate to it.”
At times, the traditional yoga teachings practiced by the Tree conflict with the lived experiences of its participants. For the teachers at the Tree, preaching messages that veer into toxic positivity is insensitive to situations that students may be in, Ortiz-Contreras said.
“What we try to amplify is the message of: If there’s space in you to look outside of yourself, and know that you are not in immediate danger, give yourself that space to breathe and focus,” Ortiz-Contreras said. “And maybe that will allow you to confront those situations.”

I didn’t find many answers blowing in the wind on this past chilly Monday that interrupted a warm and sunny weekend, but I did find plenty of trash. Even as I opened the door to Seeds to purchase an overpriced Red Bull, a tornado of napkins and crumpled up receipts accompanied me inside.
We certainly have a beautiful campus, something I often take for granted but am reminded of each time I host a family member or friend. While it features a bit more concrete than other pristine campuses around the country, there is some escape that the hill behind Founders Park or the hill next to McCarthy Quad provides from the industrial environment that is downtown Los Angeles.
I’m graduating in exactly five weeks from this article’s publication, so perhaps my musings of appreciation for USC’s campus are through the dreaded graduation goggles that fog up the mundanity that comes with populating a small space for a long time. But, hey, it is a pretty campus — pick up trash when you see it.
As appropriate for someone graduating from college in a little over a month, I have been firing away on job applications. From newspapers to television stations to NFL teams, I’ve run the proverbial gauntlet of searching for jobs that might be a good fit for an English-turned-journalism major (If you are a hiring manager and are reading this, DM me).
In this process — and I promise that we’ll get to climate stuff soon — I’ve been lucky enough to get a couple interviews, not to brag. While I’ve prepared for each one, doing some research on the company and my potential role, what I’ve found is that I don’t know what exactly I want to do with my life and my love for journalism and sports.
If you haven’t participated in many job interviews thus far, here’s a sneak peak. You will almost certainly be asked about your career goals or where you see yourself  in 10 years or some variation of this existential question. And, I mean, this is something that I do think about, but I think about it as if I’m filling out a March Madness bracket: There are seemingly endless combinations of what might happen and, while I might put a lot of time and effort into each pick, I have no idea what my future holds.
I do my best to express this, saying something along the lines of “I have varied interests and could see myself going down a range of career paths, but am just excited to see what the next step is.” But even writing that sentence out, I got bored. It’s not a substantial answer, even if it is accurate.
What I’ve recently added to my rehearsed-but-often-rambling answer to said existential question is a possibly silly idea of purchasing a VW camper van and driving from Canada to Chile over the course of a year or two, stopping hundreds of times along the way to evaluate the natural world. I want to scope out what’s happening to it: what humankind is doing to hurt the environment, what we are doing to help it; who cares, who doesn’t care.
Maybe I’d write a book about it or blog about it. I guess I’d have to monetize it somehow to make it worth it (right?).
But anyway, I’ve started giving a version of this answer in job interviews, some of which are in the sports world, the remainder of which are in the journalism world and many of which are in both worlds.
I would love to have a career in sports journalism. I think that sports highlight some of the best aspects of humankind: resilience, competition, unity, to name a few. I also, however, think that the sports industry, like everything in the entertainment industry, is in danger of increasing the strain it is putting on our environment, in every sense. What is SoFi Stadium’s role in the price-gouging of properties in Inglewood? It’s significant. How much of an environmental footprint does professional sports as an industry have? A pretty big one.
There have been great strides in the sports industry to reverse the negative impact it has had on the environment. I’ve tried to cover some of them in this column. But, as L.A. Clippers guard Russell Westbrook once said, “I’m never satisfied. I’m always trying to get better and learn from my mistakes.” 
Like Westbrook’s problem with turnovers, the sports industry certainly has room for improvement in its carbon footprint and the way it treats low-income communities. As the world continues to look different every day, so too must the world of sports.
I don’t know what my role in any of that will be, but I hope to contribute in some way. Whether it’s working as a beat reporter for the Buffalo Bills or as an intern at ABC or just picking up trash when I see it, the world will always be bigger than just sports.

Earlier this season, USC took the trip up to the Barbara Kalbus Invitational in Irvine and ended the weekend facing off with Stanford. It was an intense, evenly-matched bout, with the two squads being tied at seven apiece entering the final quarter of play. 
During that Feb. 26 game, redshirt senior utility Bayley Weber notched a goal with just under five minutes remaining to put the Trojans up two and Stanford on the ropes. Then, the Cardinal rattled off three unanswered goals, scoring the game-winner just 10 seconds before the final buzzer. 
Since then, USC has notched nine straight wins in dominant fashion, scoring double-digits in all of them and only allowing its opponents to surpass 8 goals in only one outing.
“We just knew how to play with each other better, figured out our rotations and our best way to play,” said redshirt junior driver Alejandra Aznar in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’ve learned about our weaknesses throughout all this time … I think we have much clearer objectives and goals on what we need to do to win the game.”
One of the many strong points for this Trojan team as of late has been their play at the defensive end, holding their opponents to under five goals in their last two outings. 
“Defense is all attitude,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric of his team’s knack for keeping opponents out of the net. “I’d like to give the credit to the girls. The way they train is a reflection of the way they’ve been playing the last couple of games. I wish them good luck and to continue with that same attitude and same intensity.”
Stanford was able to thwart the Trojans in their last meeting, but USC has had over a month to prepare for this upcoming match, and it’s been circled on their calendars.
“We’ve really got back to basics,” said Pintaric describing this last month of training. “We’ve used this time in between those two games to train hard, to work on our fundamentals, to tighten up the defense and to focus on Stanford player by player.” 
Taking down the Cardinal will be no easy feat. They boast an undefeated 16-0 record and, similar to USC, have won most of their matches handily, destroying Santa Clara 23-2 their last time out. 
A major factor in whether or not the Trojans are able to avenge their lone loss of the season will be their ability to slow down Stanford’s high-powered offense. 
“We just have to take care of Stanford’s fastbreak. They have a very aggressive and good fastbreak,” said Aznar when asked what the team’s focus is on heading into the weekend. “Also their center play, we need to figure out the best way to stop it and not allow easy ejections.”
No team is better equipped to beat Stanford than USC, though, as their last matchup was the Cardinal’s closest game and toughest test all season.
This match is sure to live up to the hype. The top two teams in the country will clash at Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 1 p.m Saturday.

After facing UC Berkeley and Stanford last week, USC will host the same two teams at McAlister Field this week. The Trojans will face the Golden Bears Friday ahead of a rematch against the Cardinal Sunday. 
Throughout the season, the Trojans have prided themselves on their stalwart defense. The Trojans are currently No. 11 in scoring defense in the nation, and are the highest-ranked team on the West Coast in the IWLCA Division I Poll. 
“It’s a really veteran unit,” said Head Coach Lindsey Munday in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “[Senior defender] Danielle Carson has been back there for a long time with [senior defender] Olivia Dooley … They take a lot of pride in what they do.”
Dooley has a team-leading 27-caused turnovers on the season. Meanwhile, Carson is tied with sophomore defender Alexis Niblock for a team-high 24 groundballs.
“Trusting each other and knowing that we’re the greatest when we have each other’s backs has really been critical for us,” Dooley said.
Last week, the Trojan defense allowed six goals against Cal before surrendering a season-high 15 against Stanford. The Trojans give up an average of 8.67 goals per game.
Both Cal and Stanford won over USC in the draw circle. The Golden Bears won 14 of 21 draw controls, while the Cardinal won 25 of 31. 
In draw control percentage, the Trojans rank outside the top 50 in Division I Lacrosse. Twelve different players have recorded at least one draw control throughout the season.
“We want to continue to get better each and every day,” Munday said. “After games, you really look and assess what went well, but also assess what we need to improve upon. So nothing changes, even facing the same opponent.”
In the cage, junior goalie Kait Devir is 21st in the nation with a .485 save percentage, the highest of any eligible goalkeeper in the Pac-12.
On offense, junior attacker Maggie Brown leads the Trojans with 26 goals despite starting in only five of the Trojan’s 11 games this season. Brown had five goals in her team’s loss against Stanford last Sunday.
Aside from Brown, four players have 20 goals or more on the season. The Trojans average 12.83 goals per game, good for 37th in the nation.
“Knowing our tendencies and what we like to do really bonds us as a unit, and I think that’s something that we really focus on,” said senior attacker Ella Heaney.
Heaney and the Trojans will first face Cal Friday. The Golden Bears are 3-8 overall and 1-4 in the Pac-12. USC has won 15 straight games against Cal, its longest active win streak against a single team.
Cal’s 10.27 goals per game puts them last in the Pac-12. Senior midfielder Maya Lawliss leads the Golden Bears with 23 goals. 
Next, the Trojans will look for revenge against Stanford. In the preseason poll, USC was projected to finish second, while Stanford was projected to finish first. Currently, the Trojans are in a three-way tie for first place with Colorado and Stanford. 
 The Cardinal are tied for 15th in the nation with 14.73 goals per game. Sophomore midfielder Annabel Frist’s 35 goals lead the team. The Nashville native is top-25 in the country in goals per game.
USC’s loss against Stanford was just the Trojans’ 18th defeat against an unranked opponent in program history. 
“[We’ve been] learning from the past two games, watching a lot of film, learning from our mistakes and that will propel us to move forward this weekend and learn from what we can do better,” Heaney said. 
The Trojans will return to McAlister for their final homestand of the regular season with matches against Cal Friday at 3 p.m. and Stanford Sunday at noon.
