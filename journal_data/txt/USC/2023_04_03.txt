This is the final stretch. The beginning of the end. In a couple months, I will have completed another year of college (yay). However, as much as I’m pushing myself to make it to the finish line, I wonder if I will survive — especially considering spring semester doesn’t have as many days off as the fall.
Maybe with the exception of those who got to live it up in Cabo, spring break was not a break. I couldn’t fully savor the finite number of breaks I received as a college student because the dread from the work I was expected to complete never disappeared from my mind. Not to mention the sudden transition back makes it hard to adjust to classes and finding motivation feels even more difficult than before.
If you also feel that the light at the end of the tunnel is so far away, or that this semester is far too long, I want to assure you that it’s not you — it’s our academic calendar.
There are 73 instructional days in the spring semester, with 30 consecutive days that start from when students get back from spring break (Week 10) to the last week of classes (Week 15). However, with finals and study days included, there’s an expectation that students are studying, so students realistically spend even more time without any breaks. For 30 days, students persevere through the longest period of instruction of both semesters.
Spring semester not only feels harder than fall semester, it actually is. According to the American Psychiatric Association, the seasonal changes of winter makes January and February one of the highest depressing periods of the year because of seasonal affective disorder. On top of that, students don’t just have to worry about finishing classes; the end of the year means move-out day for those off-campus housing — inconveniently on the last day of finals on a random Thursday.
To say that spring semester can be really stress-inducing is an understatement.
A break between Week 10 and 15 could help students both academically and mentally. Any day will do. Extended study days or a replication of a two-day break for students to catch up with instruction — the possibilities are endless. 
Now, what’s the feasibility of this? What trade-offs need to be made? Where do we start to make this happen? To answer these questions, we turn to the success of what we know today as fall recess — a fairly young initiative that only has been in effect at USC for the last four years.
Conversations surrounding a fall recess date back to 2009, when the administration and the Undergraduate Student Government determined whether including Wednesday in Thanksgiving break or taking a fall recess somewhere between the first day of classes and Thanksgiving would be more favorable to the student body. After two years of lobbying, the extended Thanksgiving break passed.
However, students remained unsatisfied and a new push for fall recess began. Determining the perfect break to give students — the length and placement within the semester, and implementing it — was a process that would take another decade.
The proposal of a fall recess started by USG in 2014, passed in Fall 2017 and was implemented in Fall 2019. The success of the initiative took countless preliminary pollings and surveys, plus proposal rejections from the Academic and Faculty Senates and a collaboration with the Engemann Student Health Center in 2018. This allowed fall recess to come to life and shortened the period of instruction from Labor Day to Thanksgiving break from 56 days to 27 days. 
For the last two years, I used my spring break as an opportunity to build up my savings at my work-study job. Others use this coveted time to visit family or travel with friends, spending hours in either the car, train or on a plane and at the airport. Overall, the full week of spring break is impossible to maximize and more buffer time will only allow students to mentally decompress by adjusting back to instruction.
Of course, another break in the Spring is not a one-size-fits-all solution. I’m sure the same issues that arose in the original proposal of fall recess such as gaining approval from the Office of the Provost to change the academic calendar, balancing the different needs of break lengths and times for students and working with professors to adjust curriculum would once again need to be solved before approving extra time off.
However it is not impossible. Although we, the student body, may not reap the benefits for an initiative we conceived, the efforts of the past demonstrate the importance of patience and persistence. Advocacy for our own success and wellbeing is not a lost cause. We just need to start now.

In the wake of the second largest bank failure in United States history, no one seems to acknowledge the elephant in the room — an ominous sign of economic recession. The last time a bank of this caliber collapsed was in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Then, it was Washington Mutual. After WaMu collapsed, 500 other banks followed in their footsteps. 
This time, it was Silicon Valley Bank. With $209 billion in assets, and only $250,000 federally insured for each customer, many small businesses are bound to lose money. Other banks will surely deal with the repercussions. Learning from our mistakes is critical; history tends to repeat itself. 
A cataclysmic event like this would typically raise concern for the health of the economy and the banking world at large. When a similar event happened 15 years ago, it was symptomatic of a much larger problem. Yet, no one seems to be taking this theory seriously. This wishful thinking is dangerous. Small businesses and families must brace themselves for possible economic turmoil if SVB is not an isolated incident.
Mainstream political pundits may not acknowledge the possibility of economic turmoil, but that does not mean they refuse to discuss this issue. Prominent figures on both the left and the right find ways to spin this narrative to advance their political agendas. Tucker Carlson took to his platform to paint SVB as a “woke” bank. He blamed their failure on mismanagement and incompetence. According to Carlson, the organization’s emphasis on diversity came at the expense of properly running a bank. In other words, Carlson used the bank’s association with a left-wing geographic region and pro-diversity policies to advance his political agenda.
While the right framed this story to fit their narrative, many Democrats have done the same. President Biden recently claimed that Silicon Valley Bank’s failure calls for increased banking restrictions. Biden called for an expansion of the Dodd-Frank banking restrictions that were signed into law during the Obama administration. The problem is, Dodd-Frank is one of the most controversial bills from the Obama era. In essence, Dodd-Frank imposed numerous restrictions and government regulations on the banking industry.
Whether this bill was successful depends on who you speak with and what side of the political spectrum they land on. On the one hand, some agree that the bill may have provided protections for banks, but the economic effects were minute. The point is that Biden’s push for an expansion of Dodd-Frank laws is not an honest attempt at protecting the economy. Biden is acting as an opportunist, using SVB as a chance to pursue Obama-Biden initiatives further. 
If you are interested in a career in banking, the Silicon Valley Bank failure should be most alarming. If history repeats, this bank failure will spur a domino effect of losses among smaller banks. We could be witnessing early signs of an impending financial crisis. Perhaps more alarming is our leaders’ inability to focus on the real issue. Politics is getting in the way of problem-solving. 
One of two things must be true. SVB’s failure was either an isolated instance of poor administration or a sign of a more severe economic problem. Republicans argue that the bank’s failure was caused by woke, incompetent management. This is clearly a political narrative; political leanings do not determine whether banks succeed or fail. Democrats dispute this Republican claim but also insist that this was a singular event, not an indication of a deteriorating economy. This reasoning is flawed; it implies that the bank’s failure was not an isolated incident if management is not to blame. Democrats refuse to recognize the more important economic crisis but do not blame the administration.
Politicians do not want to address the looming economic threat because it is inconvenient. They do not want to address the repercussions of decades of irresponsible fiscal policy. Republicans and Democrats would rather spin political narratives than work to solve a problem that could affect all of us. If you want to pursue a career in banking, you should be most concerned. Even if you are not interested in banking, the impending financial crisis could be drastic enough to impact all of us profoundly.

It was a Thursday night at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, hours away from the global release of boygenius’ debut album “the record” and its accompanying short film, “the film,” directed by Kristen Stewart. Passionate fans rounded the corner, eagerly awaiting the band’s arrival as the smell of vegan fried goodness wafted from the Monty’s Good Burger food truck parked outside.
Julien Baker, Lucy Dacus and Phoebe Bridgers emerged arm-in-arm from a shiny stretch limo in matching all-black attire. It was clear from the moment they set foot on the red carpet that they functioned as a unit; they were inseparable, yet distinctly individual.
In the theater, the audience teemed with excitement as Kristen Stewart was brought to the stage to give her opening remarks.
“It was a knock-out, fall-down honor to be asked to try and distill the incredible firework show that pops off when these three come together,” Stewart said. “It felt like a fever dream making this thing, and I imagined if you got to step into what feels like their shared consciousness, that you might feel pretty on fucking fire too.”
And with that, the film began, as the audience was introduced to the three boys in their respective bedrooms, preparing for bed. Throughout “the film,” viewers are guided through the subconscious of each band member, a pastiche of intimate glances into the complicated inner workings of some of the defining musicians of this generation. Each of the members experienced their own visualization, yet in the end, they always seemed to find each other.
Whether it be blood oaths, arson or paint-covered make-out sessions, the film’s lush imagery and well-integrated motifs effectively communicate the unconditional love that bonds this group together.
Their connection was instantaneous and undeniable. 
“I thought immediately when we all started hanging out, that the plan was always to make a full-length album. I was like ‘This will just be a part of my life. This is part of my five-year plan,’” Bridgers said.“From the day that we were in a room together, we were a band.”  
For boygenius, the music and their friendship provide them with a healthy, loving support system, and it’s clear that since their union, they have each grown as a result.
That day, Baker was celebrating 10 years of releasing music, and reflected on how much she’s changed since her first band The Star Killers released their debut album on March 30, 2013.
“I was listening back to that record today, and I was like, ‘Holy moly, this kid had a lot of feelings and needed to communicate them,’” Baker said. “It’s my first groping attempt at making something, and I stuck with it long enough as a craft because of what I get out of the practice of music and the magic of sound. But I also stuck with it because of the avenue it provides me to feel understood by other people.”
It is abundantly clear just how close the band has gotten since it formed five years ago. In the time since their initial EP release in 2018, they’ve evolved from a group into one, united by the symbiotic nature of their relationship. 
“If you show up, that’s a life lived together,” Dacus said. “And we do that for each other, we just share space and learn more and allow each other to support each other and feel humiliated by each other.”
Their rapport is truly one to behold, it’s as if they had been led to each other by some divine force, and it’s magnificent. Not only is this kind of camaraderie hard to come across, but it’s also rare to have the chance to develop a physical, tangible embodiment of this shared love. 
“I finally know what a ‘Horcrux’ is, so this record is like a good ‘Horcrux.’ It’s like you took all the positive energy and now I can’t experience it — the writing process and the creative process with the record and the learning process — as separate,” Baker said. “I almost said [it was] magic, and I made myself say something less genuine, so I wanted to edit it and say magic.”
This magic is why fans love boygenius as much as they do.
“It’s just kind of incredible to see … three real people making genuine real work that means a lot to them,” said Chloe Flaherty, a fan of boygenius. 
When introducing the film, Kristen Stewart admitted that she “wish[ed she] had them to look up to as a kid,” and it’s easy to understand why. boygenius is a beacon of hope for those of us who haven’t yet found what they have been so lucky to find within each other. Their music lets listeners become active participants in their shared narrative, with an outstanding vulnerability that makes audiences feel seen, heard and loved.
“If I find a relationship that’s so creatively and intimately fulfilling, like it seems [that] they have, that’s all I could ever ask for,” said Addie Alaimo, another fan of the band.
Finally, boygenius imparted their wisdom for their loyal audience of young creatives:
Phoebe Bridgers: Love it. Not like love making art, it’s hell … If you’re not a huge fan of what you’re making, then you’re going to disagree with the people who like it … If it’s fun for you to listen to or watch or whatever you’re doing, then you’ll find people who are like you who like it. I love this band, so if anybody doesn’t like it, I’m like, ‘you’re a bitch.’
Lucy Dacus: Also, a good thing about loving it is that you don’t have to rely on being satisfied by where you get with it. If you don’t like it when you’re sleeping on floors, you won’t like it when you’re in a bus … If it’s feeling like it is draining your energy and not that fun, find something else to do.
Julien Baker: I think that sometimes it’s easy to feel discouraged because you’re demanding recognition for something that feels unsure and that is precious and valuable to you. But that’s what makes it, you know what I mean?

Since the emergence of the hero saving the damsel in 1981’s “Donkey Kong”, video games have cultivated archetypal roles as a staple in gaming genres by giving characters a sole purpose, negligent of consciousness outside their programmed code. Even several decades after, Mario’s continuous pursuit to save Princess Peach still echoes how games romanticize traditional roles. 
This is undoubtedly represented in role-playing game titles such as “Fire Emblem,” a game that features roles like damage dealer and healer that subject characters into roles both literally and figuratively, putting the “role” in role-playing games.
Unlike films, where actors have more freedom to express their character’s moral compass, the nature of role-playing video games is filled with constraints when it comes to diversity and replaces human ambiguity for programmed dialogue. 
However, in creative director Rachel Geng’s “STARWEAVE,” a MFA thesis project created by the third-year master’s student in interactive media, this concept of roles in video games was a perfect way for her to explore what happens when characters don’t fit into their imposed societal rules.
“The theme is a story about constricting roles and the cycle of oppression. The characters take on roles that they don’t want, that they don’t feel like they belong in but they’re forced to play out those roles,” said Ashley Kim, a senior majoring in theater and the executive producer of “STARWEAVE.” “In the end [the characters] have to make a decision of ‘Am I just going to just go with this role that’s been forced upon me’ or ‘Am I going to do what I want to do, whether or not society likes it.’”
Consisting of a development team of 50 artists and engineers from in and outside USC, “STARWEAVE”’ is a hybrid 2D and 3D narrative role-playing game geared towards LGBTQIA+ community members in which a group of teenagers are transported into a dream world known as “Lucid” to fight demons attempting to bring chaos into the real world.
The game is set to be available on Steam after the USC Games Expo on May 10, an annual one- to two-day convention that showcases all the student games from this academic school year. In “STARWEAVE,” the player plays as the leader of the group, “Dreamer,” and is tasked with learning how to interact with the diverse members of her team to work together as a surrogate family. 
The highlight of this adventure is that the characters undergo personal journeys and encourage the player to learn the psyche of each character as they bond with them in this three hour long experience. 
One of the ways that Geng was able to challenge the player in learning the personalities of each character is by implementing a mechanic known as “Refusal,” giving her characters free will through artificial intelligence coding, to decide whether or not to follow the players directions according to what they would actually do.
By allowing the characters to either accept or reject the orders from “Dreamer,” “STARWEAVE” becomes one of few games that allow fictional characters to supersede player’s instructions and requires players to act based on what that character would do if it could respond.
“I definitely think it was just a really cool technical thing to work. When Rachel pitched it to me, I was like, ‘Wow, that sounds horrible from a programming perspective. Let’s try it,’” said Sammy Chuang, a master’s student studying fine arts. “The ‘Refusal’ is just so unique and special in terms of the mechanics. I think there’s so much to this game because from a mechanical perspective, the combat is super cool.”
As a narrative-centric game, the Refusal was important to the main theme of teamwork and plays an integral part in relaying this message to the player as they move forward.
“Our narrative goal for this was to create an environment in which everything was pointing back to the battles, where everything was about understanding each character’s psyche, both personally and in battle, seeing how those things connect so you can respond to it in our strategy gameplay,” said Gale Sullivan, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment and the narrative lead. 
Outside of the difficulty in learning the inner mind of all four characters, “STARWEAVE” weaved in conversations on the concept of role-playing games in the perspective of fictional characters.
“The characters of the story are constantly debating on whether the forces that brought them here together are actually right about anything,” Sullivan said. “Why would the universe pick them? That’s a very typical … stage of denial whenever a hero is picked on a great quest and there’s a stage of debate. But that debate is kind of what the entire story is about.”
An avid gamer since youth, Sullivan spoke on how some of her favorite games inspired her to take this narrative in a conflicted and dramatic route. 
“I think about the characters in ‘Mass Effect’ and how they were all striving for closure the entire time,” Sullivan said. “Where everyone in ‘STARWEAVE’ is kind of looking for a way to follow their own potential, follow their own destiny.” 
In watching these characters sort out their interpersonal conflicts, Sullivan expressed that “STARWEAVE” at its heart is a “story about having faith in yourself, even though the world doesn’t have faith in you.”
Sullivan was not alone in her efforts to make “STARWEAVE” a morally narrative heavy game for players to dissect, and other team members expressed what they wanted players to take away from the experience. 
“We need to be kind to ourselves and kind to each other because a lot of people are going through difficult things that are out of their control and they don’t feel satisfied in their life,” Chuang said. “I just hope that people can be impressed by how interesting of a game experience it can be.” 
Although diversity was a large emphasis for the game’s cast of characters in “STARWEAVE,” creating diversity outside of “Lucid” was equally at the forefront of Geng’s vision.
“One of the things that we really want to push with this game is diversity, not just within the game with the characters, but also in the [development] team,” Kim said. “So having a lot of leads who are women, who are people of color, that was really big for us … We really are pushing to be an example of a [development] team that has a lot women, a lot of people of color and making a game that also a lot of diversity in it.”
The game is set to release after the USC Expo in May with no specified date. Kim expressed that currently, there are no plans to continue updating “STARWEAVE” after the convention but with enough traction, the development team may take this thesis project even further.

As Fall 2023 registration opened for continuing students March 27, one student is harnessing artificial intelligence to streamline the course-searching process. 
Danial Asaria, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, is the mind behind Trojan Courses (trojancourses.com), a website that aims to help students find classes by searching via the content of the courses rather than exact keywords. Asaria said he launched the website because, while USC has numerous interesting classes, it may be challenging for students who want to explore new fields to find them.
“The upfront work to manually sift through and find classes that you really want … causes people to give up completely and stay within the bounds of whatever their major is,” Asaria said.
On the front end, users enter what they wish to learn and then the website returns a list of classes and their descriptions. Upon clicking the link for the class they’re interested in, users are redirected to USC’s Schedule of Classes for the specific course, where students can get more relevant information.
Trojan Courses, launched Tuesday, uses AI-powered semantic search, which looks at the intent or meaning behind the user’s search rather than matching keywords. The website relies on a vector database, which turns words into numbers and then compares these numbers to determine close matches on which to base its results. The website has access to all courses for Fall 2023 through USC’s Schedule of Classes Application Programming Interface
As of the time of publication, the website had 1,349 unique visitors and 2,596 page views. Jacqueline Guo, a freshman majoring in computer engineering and computer science, and a user of Trojan Courses, said the website is convenient to find classes.
“In order to find a class, you typically find it through the specific name of the class or by the course number,” Guo said. “Especially if you’re looking for a fun class … this is probably a better way to search for those directly.”
Sunny Singh, a graduate student studying business administration, said he was unfamiliar with USC’s course Catalogue and wasn’t aware of the meaning of each abbreviation — making it especially time-consuming for him to find the specific entrepreneurship and finance classes he was looking for. Trojan Courses helped him solve this issue.
While the website is innovative and relatively easy to use, he said, there is scope for further enhancements and more features to help students.
“It would be interesting for me to see when certain classes are offered or if they’re only offered in certain semesters, like Fall or Spring, so that I could do a better job of potentially populating my course selection,” Singh said. 
Asaria said he plans to introduce further updates, such as adding the number of units, matching the class timing with classes the student has already registered for and integrating Google Calendar. Furthermore, he proposed personalizing the classes suggested by the website based on the track the student is interested in or their major.
“Some classes are annoying … you have to have certain requirements to take them or be in a certain major,” Asaria said. “Maybe you can personalize it more. This is my major, these are the classes … and then that filters out through the classes that only apply to me.”
Asaria said integrating Trojan Courses into Web Registration, which is how students search and register for classes, is his end goal.
“I have emailed a few teachers after developing it, asking if I can try to integrate it,” Asaria said. “One of my teachers is really responsive … She said she’ll show it in meetings in a few weeks and maybe that will help, but I haven’t gotten any specific leads yet.”
Although his website is currently only for USC students, Asaria said he hopes it can expand to other schools.
“My code is pretty generalized,” he said. “All I need is their classes and the rest is already done. If I can get their classes in the same format as USC … or I can even turn it into the format I did, then I can definitely expand this to different schools.”

In a hole-in-the-wall venue washed in amber ambiance, TOLEDO took the stage to conclude their first solo tour, “How It Ends.” Having performed for seven cities prior to coming to Los Angeles, Daniel Álvarez de Toledo and Jordan Dunn-Pilz brought both experience and melancholy to this final show, ecstatic to play for L.A. fans, but sad to see the tour come to a close. However, fans can rest easy with the knowledge that there may be future shows to come.
“It’s been great,” said Álvarez de Toledo in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We want to just do this all the time because we’d love to be touring constantly.”
With the room packed to the brim, TOLEDO welcomed the support of a crowd teeming with loyal fans who knew every word of their songs both old and new. The dazzling atmosphere of the Moroccan Lounge had a relaxed and amicable tinge, as if the band was revisiting old friends to catch up and exchange a laugh and a drink.
On a platform illuminated by an ever-shifting aura and a little disco ball, the duo performed pieces of their flawless discography, even showcasing songs from their recent release “How It Ends (UNRATED EDITION).” 
During the first quarter of the show, TOLEDO showcased fan favorite “Dog Has Its Day,” immediately demanding the attention of the crowd with their inviting charisma and visible joy in performing. “Flake” was met with electrifying excitement from audience members, many shouting along with the song’s staple lyrics “I fucking hate your guts right now.” 
TOLEDO’s discography is consistent in both sound and quality, but every track harbors a stripe of uniqueness to it that prevents repetitiveness. Each song projects a clear intention and vibe, which the pair attributes to their sources of inspiration.
“We are really inspired by film,” Álvarez de Toledo said. “When I [draw from] film, I can steal an emotion or a feeling.”
Dunn-Pilz expanded upon the sentiment, explaining why the duo values inspiration taken from film over music.
“When we listen to music for inspiration, it’s really hard to disconnect that from the product we’re going to end up with,” Dunn-Pilz said. “You don’t want to steal from people, [so when] pulling from a visual medium like film you can be like, ‘this mood or atmosphere, I want to bring into the music.’”
TOLEDO’s unique creative process, which plays to their reliance on each other when producing new music. Álvarez de Toledo emphasized this symbiotic creative dynamic.
“We’re not a band. We’re just the two of us, so a lot of the creative process feels like we start things on our own and then we can’t really finish them without each other,” Álvarez de Toledo said. “We usually get just 20 seconds into working on something, and then we’re like, ‘Okay, now it’s time to go involve the other person.’”
The love and care TOLEDO has poured into their numerous tracks blindingly shine through, even more so when the duo performs them live. Throughout the night it was apparent that the extra magic ingredient in their songs stems from TOLEDO’s good-humored and jubilant personalities. Between songs, Álvarez de Toledo and Dunn-Pilz were constantly interacting and joking around with each other, their band and the crowd. While performing, the pair were clearly having the time of their lives, emanating their radiant elation throughout the room.
The setlist of the show displayed the duality of TOLEDO’s discography perfectly. “Qué Pasa?,” a slower song written in tribute to Alvarez de Toledo’s father, had the crowd swaying to and fro to the tune’s calming ambiance. The song was a warm hug engulfing the venue and stood in contrast to “Oak Hill,” one of TOLEDO’s more recent releases, which sets pleadingly apologetic lyrics against the backdrop of a graceful instrumental. The final song on the setlist, “Sunday Funday,” returned to the calmer vibe while incorporating an intoxicatingly dreamy chorus to complement lovely vocals.
After TOLEDO left the stage, the audience immediately raised a cacophony, clamoring for an encore. Everyone knew the band wouldn’t leave without performing one of their most iconic tracks. Luckily, their assumption was confirmed as Álvarez de Toledo and Dunn-Pilz sauntered back on stage within less than a minute of their departure. With that, TOLEDO began “Some Samurai,” the pair’s incredibly popular song from their 2019 EP “Hotstuff.” The atmosphere was nostalgic and pure, as most of the crowd unabashedly sang along with the performers. 
Wrapping up their (actual) final song, TOLEDO bid their farewell to L.A. but promised to return in time. Even after exiting the stage, the vibe from their evocative performance hung in the air and will remain until TOLEDO makes their return.

A student initiative aims to increase the amount of languages offered at USC. Kai Cayetano, a senior majoring in narrative studies, has pursued multiple languages at USC and is currently taking Advanced Korean II. However, in their time at USC, they have realized that despite the diversity on campus, language choices are extremely limited.
“I know my language is never going to be offered at a university because, one, it’s a dying language, and two, it’s an Indigenous language that so many people don’t even know exists,” said Cayetano, who is Garifuna, an Afro-Indigenous group from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. 
Last year, Cayetano started an initiative on campus to diversify and expand the languages offered at USC. They created a flier and released their survey as a Google Form in December of last year. The survey was circulated in Slack channels and by administrators through email blasts and received almost 400 responses. It was meant to gauge interest in specific languages and to show administrators that, if these languages were offered, there would be sufficient enrollment numbers.
American Sign Language garnered the most interest from students with 47 votes, while Hindi was in second place with 43 and Tagalog was third with 34. Next were Vietnamese with 31 votes, Swahili with 23, Navajo with 19, Thai with 18, Turkish and Cantonese tied with 13, Yoruba with 12, Arabic with 11 and Urdu and Tamil tied for 10 votes. 
In the early stages of the project, Cayetano met with Emily Anderson, Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences dean of undergraduate education, alongside other administrators to discuss next steps. Anderson said she was happy to hear of Cayetano’s project because it presented updated information about the languages students would like to see at the University.
“Our language curriculum changes and evolves often in response to [student concerns],” she said. “As an administrator, I see my role as [making] pathways clear and available to people and I try to keep bureaucratic obstacles to the side, but it’s really up to the students and faculty to determine what finally is accomplished.”
Significant student interest is required for the University to implement a language such that multiple levels can be offered and the program can have longevity, Anderson said. Hindi, which was the second most popular language in Cayetano’s survey, was offered on campus in Fall 2013 and Spring 2014. However, the program was terminated due to low enrollment, Anderson said.
“On a college and university level, we need certain enrollment numbers to sustain an ongoing curriculum,” Anderson said. “It’s important for students to demonstrate to faculty that there’s a kind of on the ground interest right now.”
Cayetano plans to push for the most popular languages on their survey to be added to University curriculum, including Hindi. 
“I really just want ASL and Hindi because those are the two main languages and multiple people stressed the need for it, even if they weren’t from that culture,” Cayetano said. “That’s what I want in three to five years. Give us two courses, please.”
Outside of enrollment numbers, establishing a new language can present other challenges. Different languages may need different resources to be successful as classes, said Evgeny Dengub, director of the Center for Languages and Cultures. 
“Let’s say we decide to add Ukrainian … there is no one on campus that teaches Ukrainian or has a Ph.D in Ukrainian studies,” Dengub said. “We would need to hire that person … [If] we’re discussing the possibility of adding heritage Armenian for students who speak it at home … the language would still need to find an academic home … but at least there’s faculty.”
Cayetano met with administrators last week to discuss what these classes could potentially look like. They said, prior to the meeting, that they were going to ask questions about the structure and credit value of these courses.
Cayetano said diversity has been the goal from the start of the project, and eventually hopes to implement languages from Africa, South Asia and South America. The push for language inclusivity outside of the longstanding most popular languages, they said, is needed.
“I’m not asking Dornsife or the Language and Culture Center to completely change everything it’s doing,” Cayetano said. “There needs to be more inclusivity … I want more things that are from Asia. I want more things that are from Central America, South America and I want more things from Africa.”
Correction: A previous version of the article said that Cayetano planned to meet with Dean Anderson this week. Cayetano met with Dean Anderson March 28. The Daily Trojan regrets this error. 
Correction: A previous version of the article misstated that Dengub is the former director of the Center for Languages and Cultures. He remains the current director. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

As spring break passes by and the final month of classes is upon us, there is no better time to start tuning into the NHL. 
The regular season will wrap up about two weeks into the month, and half of the 32 teams in the NHL will officially close the door on the 2022-23 season after a packed regular season.
The other half of the league will turn their attention to the Stanley Cup Playoffs with the same goal: being the last team standing and getting their names etched in history. 
Fans won’t have to wait long for playoff hockey, as the puck will drop in the postseason just a few days after the regular season’s final games on April 17. 
Though the postseason is drawing near, there’s a lot of unfinished business as multiple teams in both conferences are in tight contention for a wild-card spot. There’s also important seeding up for grabs, as many teams sitting comfortably in the playoff picture are desperately trying to secure home ice. 
That said, let’s jump into a couple of predictions for the coming weeks, one hotter than the other. 
Warm: Toronto conquers their inner demons and downs Tampa Bay.
The Boston Bruins finally did the inevitable and claimed the President’s’ Trophy, securing the best record in the NHL with their 2-1 overtime win over the Columbus Blue Jackets last Thursday night. Due to Boston’s sheer dominance this season, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning have virtually known they’ll be facing off in the first round of the playoffs for months. 
The two squads entered last year’s postseason in the same position in the Atlantic Conference, the Maple Leafs as the second-best team and the Lightning the third. Tampa Bay prevailed in seven games last year, but the Maple Leafs will get revenge this time. 
How could this be considered any bit “hot” if Toronto has the better record? Well, because the Maple Leafs are cursed. In the last nine seasons, they’ve made the playoffs six times. They have only won a single playoff series during that period. One. 
The Maple Leafs and Lightning have the same average goals scored per game, while Toronto has allowed slightly fewer goals per game. However, the Maple Leafs’ goal differential is 16 points higher than Tampa’s; Toronto either plays tight games or wins comfortably — so you can bet these Leafs are putting up a tough fight every time they take the ice in the playoffs.
The Leafs still have bonafide star power with centers Auston Matthews and John Tavares. Former Dallas Star and 2019 Stanley Cup champion center Ryan O’Reilly’s midseason acquisition gives Toronto one more offensive weapon with championship experience. 
Plus, goalie Ilya Samsonov has proven to be a reliable netminder and a guy you can trust to hold it down come playoff time. He boasts the fifth-best goals-against average in the NHL with 2.40, and the Maple Leafs will need him if they are going to go toe-to-toe with an experienced playoff goalie in the Lightning’s Andrei Vasilevskiy. Vasilevskiy is both a former Vezina and Conn Smythe winner and led Tampa to back-to-back Stanley Cup runs in 2020 and 2021.
The city of Toronto breathes hockey, and their fans will be rabid during this series — another card that plays in the Maple Leafs’ favor if they lock up home ice. 
Because of their offensive firepower and new dependable presence in between the pipes, Toronto will knock Tampa out of the first round.
Hot: New Jersey and New York tag-team Carolina.
Now, what exactly do I mean by “tag-team?” Currently, Carolina sits atop the Metropolitan Division, setting up a matchup for them with the first wild-card team and a series between the New Jersey Devils and the New York Rangers. However, the Devils are only one point behind the Hurricanes at the time of writing and will overtake them by the time the final whistle blows in the regular season. 
That’s not all though. Carolina, the second-best team in the Eastern Conference for most of the season, will fall in the first round to the Rangers. 
Carolina is on a cold streak right now, riding a three-game slide and one win heading into the weekend. Meanwhile, New Jersey is heating up, winning two of their last three, the latest being a 6-3 win over the Chicago Blackhawks Saturday. 
In addition, the Devils’ remaining schedule is primarily made up of teams who will have nothing to play for, either because they’ll have been eliminated from playoff contention or they’re the Bruins who have already clinched the top seed. Carolina, on the other hand, has to play teams such as the New York Islanders and Florida Panthers, who will be battling tooth and nail for a spot in the postseason.
This season, I trust the offensive leaders of New Jersey more than I do Carolina’s. The Devils rank among the top four in the league in goals per game with 3.5, while the Hurricanes find themselves in the middle of the pack. 
When New Jersey passes Carolina, the first round will feature a marquee rematch between the Rangers and the Hurricanes. A year ago, New York knocked out the No. 1 seeded Hurricanes in the second round of the playoffs to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.
New York also has an extremely high-powered offense, outranking the Canes in both goals per game and goal differential. Their already stellar attack became lethal at the trade deadline when they added wingers Vladimir Tarasenko and Patrick Kane, two star players with Stanley Cups in their trophy cases. 
Though Carolina has a slightly better defense in terms of goals against average, the Rangers have an absolute game changer in their net: the reigning Vezina Trophy winner Igor Shesterkin. 
It’s hard to poke many holes in the Hurricanes, but I’ll take the Rangers’ plethora of postseason experience and elite netminder to emerge victorious for the second year in a row.

It was nothing but smiles and good times for the Trojans throughout their 14-3 thrashing of San Jose State Saturday afternoon. 
USC was in control for the whole game, but the loudest cheers of the entire day came with a little over 90 seconds left in the already-decided contest. Head Coach Marko Pintaric subbed in his end-of-the-bench players, and the entire Trojan bench erupted in cheers for their teammates.
“These girls are great, they helped me through everything. Anytime I look lost, they point where I need to go; they do whatever they need to do to help me out, which is amazing,” said sophomore utility Honnie Vandeweghe-O’Shea. “I love seeing all of our teammates get the opportunity to play and I think they love it just as much.”
This win against the Spartans was nothing new for the Trojans. In the series dating back to 1998, USC is 43-0 against SJSU. USC wasted no time this game, metaphorically sprinting out the gates. Redshirt senior utility Bayley Weber tallied a hat trick before the first period buzzer sounded.
Weber showed her dominance on her third goal by high-pressing an SJSU player and ripping the ball out of her hands. Weber then finished the goal off herself with 7 seconds left to push the lead to 4 goals.
Weber currently leads the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in goals this season with 50, but was by no means the only Trojan to get in on the goal frenzy. 
Eight different USC players were able to get on the scoresheet. This has been a big part of the Trojans’ success all season, with 10 different players notching 15 goals or more on the year so far.
“Whoever is in a position to make a play or to score a goal, that player should shoot. [We] do not play games where we just put our hands all into the leading scorer,” Pintaric said. “If her role is to set somebody else up … that’s the communication that our team receives. We are very proud of setting each other up.”
The offense wasn’t the only thing on a shimmering display for the Trojans. USC’s defense had SJSU on lock and key, keeping them without a goal in the first half. This marks the second time they’ve held an opponent to a scoreless half this season.
The Trojans never allowed the Spartans to get comfortable with the ball, pressing them from mid-pool all game. The stifling pressure had SJSU throwing the ball away at the end of the shot clock for most possessions, as USC never allowed a free lane to shoot. 
“Every game, defense is always the number one priority in our game overall, and we stress a lot about making good steals, playing good press, getting in the lanes trying to take the ball,” said senior goalie Carolyne Stern. “Everything’s starting to click, and that leads to good defense.”
This win marked the ninth win in a row on the season for USC and continued its perfect start in the MPSF. The Trojans are tied at the top of the conference with Stanford after the weekend games.
Even after the win, all anyone could talk about after the game was the rematch the Trojans have against the Cardinal next weekend. The two schools have history as of late. USC’s one loss this season came at the hands of Stanford in a one-goal affair in February that the Trojans look to avenge. USC has lost four games across the last two seasons, three of those games to Stanford.
“[Stanford is] gonna bring a lot of toughness and power and all that, and I think we’re gonna bring it back,” Vandeweghe-O’Shea said. “It’s going to be a battle for sure.”
The Trojans will host Stanford Saturday at 1 p.m. at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
