Since Feb. 14, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s student activists have been a political force to be reckoned with — in-person and on social media. In the days immediately following the shooting, the students’ voices served as mere soundbites to supplement the 24-hour news cycle; a few days, tweets and Facebook events later, they emerged as leaders of the #NeverAgain movement, organizing and partaking in walkouts, rallies and political confrontations — fearless, angry and emboldened by their trauma.
Most Americans were surprised — and simultaneously inspired — by the strength these teenagers exhibited through on-camera interviews and social media, boldly clapping back at conspiracy theorists, politicians and conservative commentators in their efforts to delegitimize the students’ experience-driven activism. 
Perhaps most surprising was their ability to engage and inspire a movement of young activists through their digital voices alone, while remaining light-hearted, relatable and unabashedly confrontational about what they want: stricter gun laws and a ban on assault weapons nationwide. 
Personally, I wasn’t surprised by their online success.
I’m only a year or two older than Emma González, Cameron Kasky, David Hogg and Jaclyn Corin — the most recognizable (and Twitter-verified) names of the student activists. I’m not as surprised as I am proud of these activists for showing America the power of advocacy amplified through social media — the ability to utilize online platforms to magnify their story, regain control of their narrative and organize a campaign against their opponents.
Hogg, through various tweets, had singlehandedly called for the boycotting of companies that supported the National Rifle Association, leading to severed ties with businesses like Enterprise Rent-A-Car and First National Bank of Omaha. 
González has already amassed over 1 million Twitter followers, 400,000 more than the official NRA Twitter. She’s best known for her “We call BS” speech at a gun control rally and fearless interruption of NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch at the CNN Town Hall.
This generation — my generation — grew up immersed in the digital space, but our voices expand beyond the virtual abyss. We learned how to craft our own virtual profiles; we taught ourselves to be digitally literate; we conversed through chat rooms and forum pages through strange acronyms and emojis; we utilized Facebook event pages to invite friends to our birthday parties and witnessed the conception of trending hashtags on Twitter.
All of this digital knowledge, when transferred into a purpose for advocacy, whether it be through the Women’s March, Black Lives Matter, Graduate Student Tax Walkout or the March For Our Lives movements, becomes an unstoppable force — a force the world has only just begun to recognize. 
Young people have always been at the forefront of large-scale political movements, domestically and globally. The Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War protests were spearheaded by young people, many of whom were college students. 
Millennials and later generations are constantly portrayed as privileged, lazy and shallow as a result of the technological advances they have grown accustomed to. Instead, access to digital devices have fostered a diverse and empathetic generation of individuals who can virtually experience and educate themselves on issues to which they otherwise would not be exposed. 
As González said, they are able to utilize the internet to ensure they are well-versed in their political opinions and ensure their arguments are watertight, so that no pundit or fact-checker would be able to dismiss them. 
Equipped with tenacity and the experience-driven authority of their statuses as survivors, these student activists embody the future of political activism, one that has rapidly gained ground through smart social media strategies and cutting tweets aimed at politicians.
In an interview with ABC, Hogg admitted his generation did enjoy certain privileges that allowed them to complain. And with complaints comes blatant criticism — something the student activists and other voices of this generation are not afraid to express when it comes to political issues.
Although many individuals from older generations disregard digital platforms as a means for enacting social and political change, the foundations of grassroots organization are found within tweets, Facebook events and online forums. These spaces encourage communication and dialogue surrounding important community issues that were once touched upon through only physical campaigning and canvassing. 
And the force of these campaigns, which has emerged from the burst in political engagement following the 2016 presidential election, will only grow with the ubiquity of online platforms.

The Hauser & Wirth Los Angeles gallery recently opened up three new installations: Geta Bratescu’s “The Leaps of Aesop” (top), Mark Bradford’s “New Works” (middle) and Louise Bourgeois’ “The Red Sky” (bottom).
Following a three-week construction period, the Hauser & Wirth Los Angeles gallery in the Arts District unveiled three new exhibits last week: Geta Bratescu’s “The Leaps of Aesop,” Mark Bradford’s “New Works” and Louise Bourgeois’ “The Red Sky.” Though the movements and styles that characterize each artist could not be more disparate, all are considered pioneers in their respective fields, pushing the boundaries of modern art and boasting fruitful and substantive careers. 
Bratescu, though lesser-known internationally, is a seminal figure in the Romanian conceptual art movement. Having grown up under a strict Communist regime, her art reflects a spirit of rebellion and irreverence, fittingly personified by none other than the fabled figure of Aesop.
Bratescu’s varied oeuvre on display in “The Leaps of Aesop” comprises drawings, collages, engravings, textiles and photography, as well as experimental film, videos and performances — testaments to her artistic versatility. The whimsical figures in her “Esop” lithographs, sketched out with loose, fluid strokes, gambol and carouse, seemingly poised to leap right off the parchment. She plays with geometric lines and shapes snipped from construction paper in her “Game of Forms” series, minimalist collages straight out of a Bauhaus scrapbook. “Atelierul,” a video recording of Bratescu engaging in seemingly pointless actions — stepping into a circle of stones, drawing lines along the wall — is actually a radical form of performance art protesting an oppressive totalitarian regime. 
A Los Angeles native, Bradford’s “New Works” is the artist’s first hometown exhibition in over 15 years. Bradford has become renowned for his incisive examination of culture, race, politics and socioeconomics through the medium of abstract expression, marking him as one of the most influential artists of his generation. 
The 10 pieces that comprise “New Works” bear Bradford’s signature style; heavily gridded, the criss-crossed lines lacerating his canvases have been forcefully scratched out, creating a primal, animalistic quality. His modus operandi involves collecting windblown sheets of paper from the city streets, then plastering them on top of each other, topped with a splattering of paint. Bradford’s work is evocative of a sprawling landscape as seen from a bird’s eye view, a cartograph carved from paint, shellac and comic book scraps. 
Finally, the late French artist Louise Bourgeois is primarily known for her bronze spider sculptures, but the artist also produced a myriad of prints and paintings throughout her prolific career. For Bourgeois, art was a form of catharsis, a means of dissecting down and working through the suffering she experienced at the hands of multiple personal relationships. Viewers of her artwork cannot help but be drawn into her pain and emotional turmoil. Her surrealist, feminist art explores themes of death, memory, trauma, nature and the body. 
The works showcased in “The Red Sky” were produced near the end of her life, and, despite Bourgeois’ childish scrawl stamped into the corner of each painting, their thoughtful, somber maturity is evident. Each painting, wrought in red ink, watercolor and pencil, provides an intimate view of Bourgeois’ mindset as she approached her final years. They are highly charged, intense ribbons of red weaving their way across the panels, suggestive of the network of veins, flesh and sinew that make up the body. In “The Red Sky,” fear gives way to nostalgia, innocence to wisdom, fragility to empowerment. 
All three exhibits will continue at Hauser & Wirth through May 20.

Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
Like many, I spent most of the last two weeks keeping up with the Winter Olympics. I am by no means a competitive sports fan; in fact, I didn’t even know what luge or skeleton were until last week. Nevertheless, I feel some sort of camaraderie with the American athletes who competed in PyeongChang. In today’s gun-crazy and unstable national environment, there is nothing like a little figure skating or a few halfpipe flips to bring us back together.
Along with every other millennial homosexual male in the country (and also some white women), I fell under figure skater Adam Rippon’s spell. Perhaps not nearly to the same extent of some of my friends and colleagues who place him on a pedestal (no pun intended), but I appreciate that he uses his newfound popularity to address important issues in the media, both social and political. I was particularly drawn to a Feb. 13 feature published by The New York Times titled “Adam Rippon on Quiet Starvation in Men’s Figure Skating.” Rippon confronted the pressures of achieving the “perfect body” while competing professionally, as well as the not-so-big-secret of eating disorders and body dysmorphia that affect male figure skaters. Though I’m not a professional athlete, I related to much of what Rippon addressed in this article, including his former eating habits and his struggle to maintain a healthy body image. I thought it was a good way for the public to realize that although Olympic athletes are in superior physical shape, they may not always be happy with their bodies.
Three days later, The New York Times published another article on Rippon, this time entitled “The Secret Behind Adam Rippon’s Olympic Abs.”
I gasped. Not in an “oh-my-god-let-me-drool-all-over-my-keyboard” type of way, but out of confusion and even horror. And this was all from the headline. Then I read the feature and almost threw my laptop across the room. The Times interviewed Rippon’s personal trainer Steve Zim, who detailed Rippon’s impractical daily exercise routine and diet. But the icing on this cake was not the fetishization of unrealistic fitness standards, but a quote from Zim saying, “After the workout, I require Adam to eat within 30 minutes … You need your carbs, but nobody needs bread, pasta or rice. He gets his carbs from fruits and vegetables, like yams.” What the actual f-ck.
Look, I’m all for having Olympic abs if that’s what you want. But to write a feature ogling Rippon’s sculpted body merely days after addressing his body dysmorphia is tacky, counterintuitive and harmful to the Feb. 13 feature. But would Rippon even be popular if he wasn’t the archetype of the white gay male’s fantasy, abs and all? Probably not. But there is no use in addressing that. Maybe I’m being presumptuous in assuming everyone who has battled an eating disorder should feel this way. Maybe I’m just speaking for myself.
I grew up an overweight child and teen. By age 18, I was at my heaviest, topping the scale at about 300 pounds. Not only was I obese and unhealthy, but more so, I also felt uncomfortable and insecure with myself. I knew that being overweight as a gay man in Los Angeles would expose me to unnecessary ridicule and could ultimately affect my love life. I felt that no one would love me because of my body. So I decided to get healthy — but for the wrong reasons and in the wrong ways.
When I began losing the weight, I did so in a combination of dieting and exercise. I’d say the first 100 pounds lost were achieved correctly and responsibly. By that point, I was exercising multiple times a week and eating enough clean foods to compensate for how active I was. 
But after those 100 pounds, I reached a plateau. I wanted to lose more weight, gain more muscle, have that six-pack body I’d always dreamed of. I began eating less, which was followed by exercising more. The pounds literally fell off, more rapidly than I could ever imagine. I had never felt guilty about my weekly cheat days, but now I felt guilty for eating foods high in fat and carbs. It made me feel strong, and in control of my body. 
Then the purging began. I don’t remember the first time I threw up, but I remember feeling powerful. I could literally have my cake and eat it too, then throw it up. I didn’t have a goal weight in mind. Instead I told myself I’d stop once I was happy with my body. But that day never came.
I realized I wasn’t healthy — I was thin. But if thin, the former wouldn’t matter. And that’s the major difference.
With the rapid weight loss came excess skin that masked my abs and muscles in a sea of unwanted flesh. It dawned on me that I’d never have the “ideal” body, one that I’d be comfortable with shirtless. And it wasn’t just in my head. I used to worry that my rotund shape would be the only factor that would affect my romantic experiences, but the surplus of loose skin did a better job of that. Once after bringing a guy home after a date, he told me he no longer found me attractive after seeing my body, and promptly left. It wasn’t one of those moments that left me feeling hopelessly crushed. Maybe in retrospect it did, but I remember thinking that I didn’t blame him. I wouldn’t be attracted to me either. It didn’t matter how thin I was — as long as my skin drooped, I’d be ugly.
It has taken years of therapy to undo the negative thinking regarding my body and its flaws, and I can’t say that it’s completely gone away. I struggle every day to affirm my body with encouraging platitudes. Reading Rippon’s account of his own body issues made me feel less alone and gave me hope of a widespread acknowledgement that eating disorders and body dysmorphia affect men as well — especially gay men. But the follow-up article regarding Rippon’s toned figure dismantled all of that. We cannot sympathize with one’s struggle with body image while simultaneously applauding their physique. That’s exploitation. 
Perhaps Rippon and The New York Times don’t see it that way, but as someone who dropped out of undergrad for a semester in order to focus on my mental and physical health, I believe this is a step in the wrong direction.

Several University offices created a physical location for USC’s virtual food pantry in the Student Union building due to an increased demand from students. The virtual food pantry was originally created to support food-insecure students on campus. 
Students who visit the food pantry can pick up two large items and three small items each week. Photo from Facebook.
The Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives, with the help of campus cultural centers and the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, decided the change was appropriate in order to expand the pantry. 
The addition allows students to pick up two bulk items and three snacks and individual items per week from the physical location. The pantry includes perishable items such as eggs, milk, vegetables, frozen food, fruits, canned goods, pasta and snack items. They also offer feminine hygiene products.
“We’ve collected a lot of data from the virtual food pantry and based on the data from [it] and data from the ‘Grab N’ Go’ pantries, we felt that a physical pantry with perishable items would better serve this growing population of students dealing with food insecurity,” said Mary Ho, assistant dean for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
The food pantry is temporarily located in room 422 of the Student Union building. The Diversity and Strategic Initiatives office said it plans to expand the pantry to a bigger location later in the year. 
Those offices involved in bringing the pantry to campus say that they are using the food pantry successes at other universities to develop the most efficient and beneficial way to cater to students struggling with food insecurity.
“The Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives coordinates the Trojan Guardian Scholars program, a program for foster youth and current homeless college students,” Ho said. “Through the program, we saw students are  [also] struggling with food insecurity.” 
The pantry was opened in 2016 since some students on USC’s campus were dealing with food insecurity, Ho said. As a result, Leo Braudy, a Dornsife professor, and his wife Dorothy decided to donate to fund the pantry. The pantry began as a virtual pantry, providing students with a $25 Trader Joe’s gift card up to three times a semester. Students were also able to pick up three items at Grab N’ Go stations, one which was located in the Topping office.
Ho said the office is looking forward to uncovering more information about food insecurity at USC and he believes that being able to provide these food resources to students is an amazing opportunity.
“The food pantry program has been a community effort with a lot of folks across the University coming together, who are passionate about supporting students dealing with food insecurity and financial instability,” Ho said.
Organizers of the pantry have marketed the service to students using flyers and Facebook. Students who would like to donate food to the new physical pantry can contact diversity@dornsife.usc.edu or drop off food at STU 422.

The USC Roski School of Art and Design last week announced the addition of a two-year MFA Design program for Fall 2018. 
The new Roski campus will offer a Designer in Residence studio for students to learn through a behind-the-scenes perspective from renowned designers about their creative processes. Photo from USC News.
USC Roski Dean Erica Muhl told USC News that this new program will be housed in the AT MATEO complex in downtown Los Angeles’ Arts District. According to the USC News release, the program will be centered around experimental design, as well as teaching methods and social practices in the art industry. However, the MFA students will also have the opportunity to take electives that are offered by schools across the University to enhance their studies.
“USC continues to integrate with the extraordinary city we’re part of,” Provost Michael Quick told USC News. “Roski’s new facility places our design community right in the heart of Los Angeles’ dynamic arts scene for a learning experience that can’t be replicated anywhere else.”
Set to open this summer, the new Roski campus will feature an open concept design studio, classrooms and collaboration spaces. In particular, the campus will also offer a Designer in Residence studio, which will immerse students in a behind-the-scenes look at the creative processes that world-renowned designers undergo for projects. Additionally, the campus will implement “state-of-the-art equipment and technologies,” according to the USC News release.
“Not only will we benefit greatly from being located in the vibrant Arts District, but we will have future scholars working in profound ways with the city around them,” Quick told USC News.
The MFA program will be led by Roski Vice Dean of Design Haven Lin-Kirk and aims to maximize every student’s individual experience in the studio by implementing an instructional model “focused on critical dialogue.” 
Students will work closely with Roski faculty members, as well as a community of professional designers, artists, critics and curators that lie outside of the USC campus. These people will be participating in the Visiting Designer and Designer in Residence forums, which offer students the opportunity to engage with leading figures in the art and design industry. 
“Our program, centrally located in one of the world’s most diverse, dynamic and influential cities — and an undisputed capital of the arts and culture — will not only graduate practicing designers, but also scholars, thinkers, teachers and bold visionaries who will apply design strategy to the world’s most intractable problems,” Muhl said to USC News.
There are several aspects of the MFA program curriculum outside of courses, such as the Global Art and Design initiative, which encourages students to think globally across disciplines through a two-seminar series that provides an in-depth look at the histories, theories and practices of global art and design.
With the new MFA program, Roski looks to turn a new page on their graduate programming. In Spring 2015, seven graduate students that made up Roski’s class of 2016 withdrew from a previously launched MFA program and expressed disappointment with the program’s funding and curriculum. 
The students claimed false promises had been made by the University, such as scholarships that would cover 82 percent of their tuition that were to be granted following their first year in the program. In a statement published online, the students attributed the cut to program funding to Muhl and criticized her for her experience with visual arts.

When USC alumna Dora Gerardo first set foot on campus, she was struck by the lack of representation in her peers at the Viterbi School of Engineering. 
While at USC, Dora Gerardo studied mechanical engineering and got involved with organizations such as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers. Photo from Viterbi Website.
“Seeing the lack of representation even at USC, though I live 15 minutes away, was interesting – to be the only person that looks like me,” Gerardo said. “I think that says a lot, and it was something that I wanted to changed. For me, I was fortunate enough to have the teacher tell me, ‘Hey, you’re good at this!’ and I wanted to turn that into a large-scale thing.”
Gerardo helped start an annual STEM conference for elementary and high school girls during her junior year at USC. She said the goal of the conference is to teach young women from an early age that they have the ability to go to college and pursue degrees in fields like science and engineering. 
Out of her four siblings, Gerardo was the first to graduate from college. Her parents immigrated from Mexico when they were just teenagers, and she grew up in Lynwood, Calif., about 10 miles away from USC. 
“My school district was in the inner city, so we’re pretty limited in resources,” Gerardo said. “When I went down to USC, I realized that I was in a great position to do something about it in the sense of being able to expose people to things. That was where it started.”
At USC, Gerardo studied mechanical engineering. She got involved with events like Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day and participated in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers, but said she wanted to motivate students further through the conference. 
“I think there is a lack of exposure, a lack of motivation, and not enough people telling younger girls that they are capable doing these things,” Gerardo said. “I think exposure is something that needs to be done very early on and continue up into high school. It can’t just be something you mention, it has to be something you reinforce.”
Paul Ronney, an aerospace and mechanical engineering professor and Gerardo’s first undergraduate engineering professor, recalls Gerardo as an inspiration.
“The way that I remember [Gerardo] very specifically is that while she was a freshman, she invited me to join her for her lunch with the Norman Topping Scholars,” Ronney said. “[Gerardo] made me realize that USC is having a big effect on these students … I am prouder of my role with Dora than my role with students with every advantage because they would’ve done well no matter what with their opportunities and advantages. Dora didn’t have those.”
Along with Gerardo’s work, Viterbi has made an effort to increase representation in STEM programs at USC. While nationally only 19 percent of engineering students are women, Viterbi’s 2017 admitted class was made up of 44 percent women. Within the same class, 24 percent were minority students and 13 percent were first-generation students. 
One of Viterbi’s numerous initiatives, the Viterbi STEM Educational Outreach Program aims to encourage historically and educationally disadvantaged K-12 students within the Southern California community to pursue majors in STEM fields.
“I think a big thing is to get the students we work with to really see they can be scientists and engineers,” said Rochelle Urban, associate director of Viterbi STEM EOP. “That’s both being exposed to USC students that look like them as well as famous scientists and engineers. It’s also about giving them not just the interest but also really helping them get to the level they need to be able to succeed at USC or any other institution in STEM.”
