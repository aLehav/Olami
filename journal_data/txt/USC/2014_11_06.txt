The winners of the 2014 Silicon Beach Awards, which were held at USC last week, come from a wide array of academic backgrounds, ranging from business to engineering.
The Silicon Beach Awards is part of the larger Silicon Beach @USC conference, a collaboration by the Marshall School of Business and School of Cinematic Arts. The competition was held by the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and the Institute Communication Technology Management, both housed within Marshall.
The competition this year included  96 entry teams comprised of students and faculty across campus and consisted of two rounds. The first round was a five-minute presentation to a panel of three judges and five minutes of questions, with five teams advancing to the second round. The same process occurred in the second round, with teams presenting in front of all of the Silicon Beach Conference attendees. The first place team received $25,000 and second and third place winners received $15,000 and $10,000, respectively.
Winners of the competition were announced at the end of last week’s conference. The first place team this year is start-up LeadBoost. LeadBoost provides a tool to business managers to ensure complete visibility in their team’s activities. By tracking calls, demos and emails across web-based tools, LeadBoost allows managers to maximize productivity and revenue.
Karen Rudy, who is in her second year in the Marshall M.B.A. program, is the Chief Executive Officer of LeadBoost. She and Mark Otuteye, the chief technology officer, presented their growing business — one that is already being used by several companies.
“We were hoping through the contest to get more validation on the idea and get more feedback so that we can actually go forward and build our customer base,” Rudy said.
A start-up called Stasis Labs won second place in the competition. This project focuses on helping reinvent medicine within developing nations by developing a better system of monitoring patient vitals. Stasis Lab has created a lightweight, compact vitals monitor that measures pulse rate, blood oxygen, body temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rhythm. The monitors come equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities to facilitate the storage and organization of information.
Dinesh Seemakurty, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, is the founder of Stasis Labs.
Seemakurty said in an email to the Daily Trojan that they will use the prize money “to build infrastructure for [the project] that will increase [their] rate of prototyping the product.”
The third place team, Moving Analytics, has created a smartphone-based cardiac rehabilitation program. Cardiac rehabilitation is a secondary intervention measure for 10 million adults living with coronary artery disease that consists of supervised exercise, motivation coaching and lessons in self-management. This new product will allow patients to participate in cost-effective, home-based cardiac rehabilitation.
Adelanwa Adesanya and Harsh Vathsangam, a postdoctoral fellow at USC, are the founders of Moving Analytics. Adesanya, an alumnus who graduated last December, has been in charge of marketing and business development since last June, when the project was started.
“I think it was a really great exercise for us, just going through the competition. All the teams were great, also, so it was a really good experience,” Adesanya said.

New York Times journalist Adam Nagourney sat down with Professor Bob Shrum Thursday afternoon in the Von KleinSmid Center as part of the latest “Political Conversations” series, presented by the Department of Political Science in partnership with the Political Student Assembly.

The theme for the discussion was, “What Happened in the Midterms — and What Happens Next?” The midterm elections saw the G.O.P. add to their majority in the House of Representatives and retake the majority in the Senate, which the Democratic Party had held for the past eight years. Shrum began by noting the failure of the Democrats to turn out voters in the midterm election.
“There was this vaunted turnout operation, supposedly modeled on what Obama did, and it didn’t seem to matter at all,” he said.
Nagourney, who is the Los Angeles bureau chief for The New  York Times agreed, but noted that the reasons for the low turnout were unclear.
“I’m not sure what went on,” he said. “The Democrats put a ton of money into voter identification and voter turnout, and you don’t see any evidence that it made much of a difference.”
A central theme of the discussion was the tendency of Democratic candidates across the nation to distance themselves from Obama and his policies, rather than embrace them. According to Nagourney, the Democrats should have made the opposite decision — recognizing that Republican voters were going to vote for Republican candidates no matter how visible Obama was.
“I think they made some tactical mistakes in how they used or did not use the President,” he said. “I think it would have made more sense to have the President out there more.”
Shrum said the same mistake was true of immigration reform, which the Democrats avoided promoting over the summer on the grounds that it would cost them moderate Senate seats in the election.
“I wonder if President Obama would have been better off if he had done the immigration thing,” he said.
With regard to the Senate election in Colorado, Shrum partially blamed the lack of Latino turn out for the Democrat’s loss, something that might have been helped if immigration reform had been passed.
“Latino turnout in Colorado was pathetic,” Shrum said. “People were angry because [Democrats] hadn’t kept their word.”
Nagourney also attributed the Democrats’ poor midterm performance to the rise of ISIS and Ebola, and the perception that Obama was not in complete control of either of those issues.
“People were feeling threatened and that things were out of control, in the sense that Obama was not showing leadership,” he said. “He came across as someone who was overwhelmed and didn’t know what to do, even if that wasn’t the case.”
Nagourney said that Obama can be a strong communicator about big issues like ISIS and Ebola when he wants to be, but despite that, was pessimistic about the chance for cooperation with Republicans in the next two years.
“Obama is very capable when making a case,” Nagourney said. “But there is no prospect they are going to work together.”
Nagourney cited the presence of Tea Party Republicans who prevented immigration reform and forced the shutdown of the government as proof that the trend will continue.
Both Shrum and Nagourney developed core tenets for the Democrats in midterm elections going forward: the need to involve the President more, communicate the effectiveness of their policies and select better candidates.
Nick Spear, a sophomore majoring in political science, said the event was important because it highlighted campaign strategy.
“There is a lot more that goes into the elections than just the campaign ads you see on TVs,” he said. “There is a lot of strategy that goes into it, and it’s interesting to see how it’s enacted over the whole nation.”
Mathew Goldstein, a senior majoring in political science, said the discussion was vital to maintain the engagement of younger voters at USC.
“It covered a lot of stuff from a reliable source,” he said. “There are a lot of people here, and it’s always good to see young people engaged and asking questions. A lot of stuff was brought up about the future, which is good because that’s what’s going to impact people.”

Undergraduate Student Government and Diversity Affairs are beginning to lay the logistical bricks to create a house that supports the interests and academics of black students at the university. The planning for the house, currently dubbed the “Black House,” will move forward since the USG Senate passed the resolution on Oct. 28. The student representatives who worked on the resolution project said they will begin meeting with administrators next week to further the discussion.
For many of the student representatives who worked on this resolution, the creation of the Black House will be the catalyst to a much-needed change on campus: more space for social programming centered on the African diaspora.
“We want something that our community could take ownership of,” said Program Board Executive Director Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, who helped draft the resolution. “We are supposed to represent Caribbean students, African students and those black students born in the U.S. Having that additional space to program off campus would provide space for everyone.”
A site has yet to be determined for the house, but planners hope it will be located north of the North University Campus, possibly near The Row.
“The hub of social interaction on this campus is The Row,” Diversity Affairs Co-Director Skylar Dunn said. “We always talk about the Trojan experience, but a lot of us as black students don’t feel like we have that same experience as [our] counterparts. We would like for the house to be in that general vicinity.”
The student representatives are now looking for funding for the project. They said they have plans to reach out to the Black Alumni Association, as well as other alumni associations, the administration and, possibly obtain funding from USG student programming fees.
Student interests were measured through an online survey. For the approximately 125 students who responded to the survey, 29 percent of black students ranked “sense of belonging” as the second-least satisfying component of the USC experience, according to the resolution.
Diversity Affairs Co-Director Levi Powell said the relatively low number of student respondents has not swayed the committee’s passion for continuing this process. He also noted that the black community at USC makes up 4 percent of the student body, contributing to the low number of respondents.
“Even if it were 5 percent or 2 percent of [black] students that didn’t feel a sense of belonging, that would be worth my while,” Powell said. “I solely believe in mentorship and guidance and having people feel like they belong. It’s very difficult to be here and thrive if you feel like you’re doing it by yourself.”
He also said they are making a stronger push to reach out to more people of all backgrounds, actively  building support and receiving feedback.
Last week, the resolution was delivered to administrators, including President C.L. Max Nikias, Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett and Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry.
Vice President Rini Sampath said having the support of administrators would “open so many doors for the comfort of students” and said they have already shown that they “understand the need for this space.”
Within the Diversity Affairs committee, the co-directors said they are putting together student task forces to finalize the plans. Though they will not be here when the house opens- — Yeboah and Powell are hopeful that the house will open in four to five years — the student representatives are optimistic for the long-term influence it will have on the student body.
“We want it to last 40, 50, 60 years down the line,” Powell said. “We’re not trying to replace any model already existing, but we’re just giving another option to explore black culture and the black student experience.”
Maddie Lees, a USG residential senator who also helped draft the resolution, said there is potential for a Black House to be the model for other minority groups seeking to create more spaces to celebrate their culture.
“It’s about adjusting this model to fit the needs of the communities,” Lees said. “Not every community needs the same thing. We won’t be copying and pasting this resolution for different groups on campus, but if we can get the conversation started about what different groups and people on campus need, then that’s absolutely a success.”

On Thursday, Undergraduate Student Government hosted an information session on the USC Village, which is set to open in the fall of 2017.
The event was held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. and featured a presentation conducted by Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Vice President and Executive Director of Capital Construction and Facilities Management Lloyd Silberstein.

“This is truly an amazing moment in our university’s history to celebrate the progress we’ve made,” USG president Andrew Menard said. “This development will be the heart of a new community where students can come together and experience state-of-the-art classrooms, collaborative study spaces, concerts, seminars, and cultural and artistic events.”
Silberstein first presented images of the project as a whole, noting that the buildings have a distinctive Gothic style and pointed arch entryways.
“This campus is growing to the north, and it’s growing in a big way,” Silberstein said. “Although it looks different architecturally from the rest of campus, the design is similar to Wallis Annenberg Hall, and the tower relates to our most iconic building, the Mudd Hall of Philosophy.”
The Village will showcase a library, breakout rooms, a lounge and café facing the courtyard on the ground level alone. Underground levels have classes and large lecture halls, while higher floors will hold research spaces.
Students in attendance expressed their anticipation for the center’s opening, particularly freshmen since they will have access to The Village by their senior year.
“I’m looking forward to the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience,” Sean Thomas, a freshman majoring in biology said. “As a pre-med student, it’s really nice to see they’re putting forth the effort to improve the science program.”
Carry described the expanded residential college experience that will accompany The Village’s opening, which will house 600 freshman honors students and 2,200 others across all grade levels.
“All incoming students will be invited to live in a residential college,” Carry said. “We will offer an academic curriculum where residents can attend classes in their resident halls and participate in experiential activities like field trips and cultural events. Being a part of it will make living on campus a highlight of the college experience.”
In addition to academia, The Village features a large dance studio for the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and a 30,000-square-foot fitness center with outdoor basketball courts and recreational playing fields.
“I always feel excited when I pass by the construction of the new USC Village,” said Raphael Krigel, a freshman majoring in communication. “To me, The Village symbolizes a new chapter in the history of this ever-evolving university. It’s a wonderful investment in the future of our school and the diverse community that surrounds us.”
The Village will feature chain stores like Bank of America, Starbucks Coffee and Trader Joe’s. According to Silberstein, the facility also plans to have a bar and grill-type restaurant and “Trojan Town,” a shop where clothing from the lower level of the USC Bookstore will be relocated.
“I’m looking forward to the food options, especially the Trader Joe’s,” said Ailish Ullman, a freshman  majoring in biology. “The access will make it a lot easier for college students to make nutritious choices.”
Carry is optimistic that the expansion will be a haven for all students to have the opportunity to study, participate in extracurricular activities and have leisure time.
“The USC Village allows students to have a very sustainable college experience with the safety and convenience of having everything in one particular area,” Carry said.

I don’t really know what to do with myself without a USC football game this weekend. And for a while, I really didn’t know what to write about, especially since I already used up my “Since there’s no football this weekend, you should support your other Trojan teams” column back in September.
(While we’re on that topic, please do try to make it out to the diving match today, the women’s soccer game tonight, and the men’s and women’s basketball exhibition games this Saturday and Sunday, respectively.)
But the bye truly gives us all a little more time to relax and take a look at the world around us, rather than being buried in the drama of Trojan football.
Sometimes that world, though, can be pretty messed up.
If you’re reading this column, I’m sure you’re a sports fan (or my grandma or something), and if you’re a sports fan, I’m sure you’ve watched ESPN’s First Take, which features Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith yelling over each other about their man crushes on America’s finest athletes.
The show has always been a lightning rod for controversy, but for once, it’s not Smith’s insensitive advice to domestic abuse victims or Bayless’ insinuation that Kobe Bryant’s rape charges made him more marketable that’s bringing attention to the show. Rather, it’s the disgusting tweets comedian Artie Lange posted about First Take host Cari Champion.
On Nov. 4, Lange, whose past work includes stints on MADtv and The Howard Stern Show, sent quite a few regrettable tweets about Champion, starting with “The chick on ESPNs First Take is so f—-n hot!”
Though many might attempt to rationalize that as a compliment that Champion should have been flattered to receive (a common indictment of women who stand up to sexual harassment), the tweets only got worse.
Lange went off on a rape fantasy set on a slave plantation, and likened himself to Thomas Jefferson and Champion to his slave in a number of explicit tweets.
The racism and sexism Lange displayed — which he defended by saying he knew black women who could handle the jokes — is unfathomable.
The first problem here is that females in sports media are much more likely to be valued for their appearance than are men who appear on screen, which explains why old men like John Clayton is still featured prominently on ESPN, while Fox’s Pam Oliver was booted from sideline reporting in lieu of the younger Erin Andrews.
I’m sure that women fawn over male sportscasters at an equal rate that men do over females. In fact, I’d like to extend a big thank you to Fox Sports 1 for putting Matt Leinart and Brady Quinn on America’s Pregame. The problem, though, is that our culture has deemed it acceptable for men to voice these desires in vulgar fashion.
Lange’s rant reflects this as well as some of the other problems in our society, which are magnified in the male-dominated world of sports media.
As Fox Sports’ Katie Nolan noted on her digital series, “No Filter,” women in sports media are “allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues.”
But females in sports media are pushing for more. Here I am, as the sports editor of the Daily Trojan, and I’m thankful to say I’ve never caught any flak for it — except when I wrote my column on disliking ASU and students over there found it and called me ugly.
Here at USC, the executive producer of The Water Cooler, a sports talk show on Trojan Vision, is female, and some of the most prominent producers and talent on Annenberg Television News’ sports desk are females.
My point here is that there are a lot of up-and-coming women in the sports media industry, and these women deserve the right to voice their opinions about issues in sports, not just to sit back and ask their male colleagues to give theirs.
There is nothing about being born with two X chromosomes that means a person shouldn’t be allowed to engage in a debate about Brady versus Manning, whether Kobe is over the hill, or if the Trojans ever had a legitimate shot to make the college football playoff.
Women in sports media should be valued for their analysis, not solely for their appearances. Yes, Champion is beautiful, but that’s not all she is.
Champion is a UCLA-educated journalist who has to wake up every morning and listen to Skip Bayless’ mental gymnastics on why LeBron James isn’t the best basketball player in the world. This alone makes Champion worthy of praise.
Twitter showed its support by starting an #iSupportCari trend. ESPN mirrored those sentiments by banning Lange from ever appearing on the network, and Comedy Central canceled his appearance on its show @midnight, which was scheduled for Thursday. Champion herself hasn’t made any public comment, nor have her co-stars on the show, but many other members of the sports media landscape, from Sports Illustrated’s Peter King to ESPN’s Hannah Storm have voiced their horror at Lange’s comments.
I’ll even take Chad Johnson’s tweet, “I want to go to Starbucks w/Cari Champion…” as an implicit show of solidarity.
I support Cari. Do you?

USC’s men’s basketball team will host an exhibition game against the Cal State Los Angeles Golden Eagles on Saturday at the Galen Center. This is the first exhibition game that the Trojans have held since the 2010-11 season when they beat Point Loma Nazarene. When Cal State Los Angeles comes to town, they will be led by former USC assistant coach Dieter Horton, who is in his first year as the coach of the Golden Eagles.
Round two · Second-year basketball head coach Andy Enfield leads the Trojans into this weekend’s exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In his last year at USC, Horton served as special assistant to then-first-year head coach Andy Enfield, and helped recruit USC’s impressive 2014 class, which was ranked No. 16 by ESPN.com. The freshman class includes guard Malik Marquetti, forward Malik Price-Martin, guard Jordan McLaughlin and guard Elijah Stewart. ESPN.com also ranked McLaughlin as the No. 41 overall recruit for the incoming freshman class across the nation.
Also joining the squad are transfers Katin Reinhardt, a redshirt sophomore guard, and redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark. The two players will be playing in ther first collegiate games since the 2012-13 season after having to sit out one season for transferring. Reinhardt played his freshman season at UNLV and Clark played at Charlotte before coming to USC.
All of these additions will add depth to a team that has few returning impact players from last year’s campaign. Sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic and sophomore guard Julian Jacobs will lead the team into battle as they look to improve in the second year under Enfield.
Jovanovic will try to use his experience over the summer on the Pac-12 All Star team to bring the team success this season. Jovanovic led the All Star team to a perfect 3-0 record during its trip to China in August. He was the leading scorer on the team with 33 points, and his 11 rebounds were only one back of the leading rebounder on the team.
Other players returning to the Trojans this season include junior guards Chass Bryan and Brendyn Taylor, junior forward Strahinja Gavrilovic, sophomore forward Samer Dhillon, and sophomore guards Kahlil Dukes and Devon Pflueger. The Trojans’ roster consists of players who combine for a total of 53 starts at USC, with 52 additional collegiate starts coming from the two transfers.
Cal State Los Angeles, a Division II team, finished 15-12 last season and 12-10 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play.
After this exhibition, the Trojans open their regular season on Nov. 15 when they host Portland State.
Saturday’s game kicks off at 1 p.m. and is open to the public for free.

After narrowly dropping its fourth game of the year to No. 1 UCLA last Sunday, the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team will try to kickstart a late hot streak against No. 4 Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 12 UC Irvine on Sunday and try to channel the magic of last year’s NCAA Championship team.
Italian stallion · Freshman driver Matteo Morelli, who hails from Naples, Italy, ranks third on the team with 32 goals so far this season, including an impressive five-goal performance against Chapman in September. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
“If we can go 3-0 in the next three games, we’re going to have the same record as last year’s team had going into the conference tournament,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said. “Considering that we have nine freshmen playing, I don’t think that’s bad. I think how we respond in those three games is going to tell a lot about what kind of a team we have, and I, at this point, still strongly believe we have the best team in the nation.”
Last year, the Trojans went 28-4 and swept the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament en route to winning their sixth straight national title. After the Bruins dealt the Trojans their second loss in the 2014 cross-town series by a score of 10-8 on Nov. 2, redshirt junior two-meter Mac Carden looked to last year as a source of motivation.
“It was a tough loss [against UCLA],” Carden said. “We knew coming into the season that nothing is easy. Last year we went into the conference tournament in fourth place, and last year we had to overcome some odds, so we expect to do the same this year.”
With Saturday’s matchup against Long Beach State marking the final stretch of the regular season, the Trojans seek to execute at a high level  at the end of games — both Carden and senior driver Rex Butler said the team strayed from its game plan in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s game. Butler noted the team’s shift in concentration at the end of the loss against the Bruins.
“We just need to be more focused defensively,” Butler said. “That game we were just trying to win it with offense, and we made a lot of mental mistakes. We gave up a lot of easy goals in the fourth quarter, and our offense wasn’t working.”
The 18-4 Trojans, who are 3-2 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play, will emphasize defense as they look to bounce back against the Zacchary Kappos-led 49ers. With a team-high 51 goals on the year, Kappos has helped the 49ers earn an identical 18-4 record in 2014, with a 5-1 conference record. The 49ers’ four losses came at the hands of California (twice), UC Santa Barbara and Stanford, all three of which are ranked in the top 10 in the Collegiate Water Polo Association’s most recent poll.
The Anteaters, meanwhile, are 13-9 overall and just 1-5 in conference play. They’ll head into the matchup coming off a game against UC San Diego the day before, and three straight losses before that. The Anteaters are led by UCLA transfer Lovre Milos, a driver with a whopping 78 goals as of now.
This weekend, USC will try to muster the resiliency that has been a theme throughout the year — the Trojans have outscored their opponents 50-23 combined in three games after losses this year.
“A special thing about our team is that usually after losses, our coaching staff and our leadership really use that loss to motivate us to train a little harder and be a little more focused,” Butler said. “That’s where that resiliency comes from.”
The 12-time Coach of the Year emphasized the importance of keeping these losses from flustering the team as it begins the final stretch this weekend.
“It’s a process,” Vavic said. “You look at last year’s [San Antonio] Spurs, you look at last year’s NFL champions [Seattle Seahawks] — adversity is part of life, it’s part of sports. You really can’t labor on mistakes, you need to figure out what really is wrong and why it went wrong. That’s the challenge, and that’s what I love about coaching.”

On Wednesday morning, The New York Times sent the following breaking news alert via its mobile app: “Obama and G.O.P. Speak of Cooperation.”
Beyond the utterly sad implication that politicians deciding to (heaven forbid) cooperate with one another warrants the title of “Breaking News,” the story that ran not just in The New York Times, but in all major news outlets, is correct factually — Obama and the G.O.P. did speak of cooperation. The truth is, however, that it won’t be Obama and the G.O.P. cooperating. Love ’em or hate ’em, the midterm election results will likely cause the Democrats in Congress to cooperate with the G.O.P. The difference is more significant than you might think.
Last week, I took a more pessimistic perspective: “The next two years will be a repeat of the last two: the only difference will be that Republican-authored legislation will be getting shut down instead of Democrat-authored legislation,” I wrote.
I was perhaps too cynical in my approach. Though the American people should not expect a fireworks show of political genius in the next two years, it is fair to say that I underestimated the potential and motivation of both parties, for two reasons. One deals primarily with the Republicans, and the other with the Democrats.
But first, the facts: In the House of Representatives, Republicans expanded their majority by 13 seats, a number expected to shrink to 10 after races that are still too close to call. In the Senate, Democrats lost their majority, with the Republicans expected to hold a 52-45 lead.
When it comes to newly and already elected Republicans in both chambers, the reason they will reach across the aisle in the next two years doesn’t boil down to one sentence or even one word. It boils down to one number.
2016.
I wrote last week that a large (24) number of Republican seats are up for election in 2016, compared to just ten Democrat seats, and that across the board, those elections take place in more Democrat-friendly states. Though I’m almost certain that Republican Party leaders did not read my column last week, what is certain is that they are aware of these numbers. They are also aware that, collectively, the approval rating of the current Congress stands at 14 percent, making them less popular than used car salesmen, colonoscopies and Nickelback.
With control of both houses, the Republicans must be careful in the next two years to distance themselves from these negative numbers if they wish to insulate themselves from a rather grim 2016 electoral map. They must recognize that the only way to do this is to do exactly what they have not done while in the minority in the Senate for the last eight years: reach across the aisle to convince the American people that they are not the Congress that was less popular with Americans than an operation that sticks a tube up … well, you know.
The Republicans must be bipartisan despite some in the party who view the 2014 midterms as a clear mandate, a repudiation of Obama and a message to seize back control of Washington from the destructive behavior of Democrats. They should temper this urge because this midterm electorate is far more conservative than electorates in presidential election years. The gap between voters under 30 and over 60 was the widest in 10 years, and though seniors made up 37 percent of people who voted, young people made up just 12 percent. If Republicans interpret this as an excuse to hold more votes to defund Obamacare and debate policies more about a political statement than helping the American people, woe be unto them when Hillary Clinton and the Democrats clean their House, pun intended, and Senate in 2016.
For the Democrats, things are slightly more complicated. A very morose President Obama, speaking at a press conference Wednesday, lamented that he heard the message sent by American voters. For many Democrats in the House and Senate, the President’s policies — including the rollout of Obamacare — were largely to blame for their defeat, something they have publicly acknowledged. In fact, Nov. 4, 2014, not the next inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, might go down as the day Obama functionally left office, and the day the reins were passed to Hillary Clinton.
In terms of power dynamics, it is said that the party out of power is more motivated than the party in power. With a Republican Congress now and no more elections, Obama is a lame duck largely out of power with no chance for an agenda (save for foreign policy), and the future of the Democratic Party now lies not with Obama, but with Democrat leaders in the Senate and House who have to save face for 2016 and beyond. It is those leaders, and not President Obama, who will truly be more likely to compromise with the Republicans, and who now have a good reason to do so: motivating the base for the 2016 elections.
If either party refuses to move to the center and compromise, they’ll have to enjoy listening to Nickelback on the plane home, while The New York Times breaks the news that they’ve been voted out of office.
Nathaniel Haas is a junior majoring in political science and economics. His column, “State of the Union,” runs Fridays. 
The stopgap of bi-partisan House legislation is sitting on Harry Reid’s desk. More then 300 bills. If you believe the GOP had been the culprit in this,  you haven’t been reading the appropriate blogs,  journals,  and you’re listening to MSNBC .I am aligned with John-s comment.
If  the people had wanted congress to work with Obama, they would have sent Democrats to work with Obama. They in fact did this in 2008.  The Democrats controlled House, Senate and Presidency AND had a super majority and squanderd the opportunity given to them by the people. 
How did the Dems proceed?  They went it alone without addressing the concerns of the heartland of America. 
In 2010, as a response, Tea Party base arose across America and the Dems lost over 700 seats (when reviewing all levels of government) and in 2012, Dems recaptured some of those losses.  
When the numbers are tabulated from this week, the number is surely going to be much larger than 700 lost democratic seats (all levels of government) this time around.
Hillary, Bill and Obama were strongly rebuked (especially in their home state of Arkansas) and nearly every candidate they advocated for lost, many lost big.  
The proverbial red/blue states map of USA is vastly different today compared to 2008.
So the people have spoken, the GOP has been enabled to STOP the expansion of government and to fix the economy where the middle class has had so many struggles since the financial collapse of 2008. 
It is hard to fathom that Democrats will continue to vote in lock step with Reid, Pelosi (or their replacements) IF sound legislation is created by the GOP.  In the past there have been Dixie-crats who have voted with conservative causes so I do think Obama vetoes may not be as bad as being articulated these days. 
Failure by GOP to substantially help middle class over next 2 years,.. I agree that it will be a difficult time for GOP and they too would be letting down the people who elected them and would have squanderd their own opportunity. If that happens, the GOP deserves to be dismantled on the scrap heap.

It’s class registration time, and as many USC students know (perhaps begrudgingly), that means it’s time to make sure their foreign language requirement has been fulfilled. Some students are lucky to be proficient enough in another language to test out. Many others, however, will have to take between one and four extra semesters of language. But learning a second language is far from just another course to check off the list.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
A study done by an MIT economist found that an American who learns a foreign language gets an average earnings bonus of 2 percent. When applied to the average college graduate’s starting salary of around $45,000, this 2 percent adds an additional $67,000 to the graduate’s lifetime earnings, according to the Economist. Another study, done by the Cardiff Business School, estimated that it costs Britain $80 billion every year due to lack of proficiency in foreign languages.
American students can understand what these numbers imply for our own pockets and our government’s pocket. But still, only 18 percent of Americans are well versed in a language other than English, while 53 percent of our European counterparts can speak at least two languages.
If statistics can’t convince you, let’s talk jobs. “We need diplomats, intelligence and foreign policy experts, politicians, military leaders, business leaders, scientists, physicians, entrepreneurs, managers, technicians, historians, artists, and writers who are proficient in languages other than English,” a writer for Forbes so clearly put.
The United States isn’t the only country in the world, believe it or not (and English isn’t even our official language). To anyone who has ever taken a class in politics, sociology or business, it is inherently obvious that the United States must be able to function with the countries around us in order to survive. And to ensure that survival, we must be able to speak the languages of the countries with which we interact.
“To prosper economically and to improve relations with other countries,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in 2010, “Americans need to read speak and understand other languages.” And since understanding the basics of subjects starts in elementary school, it follows logically that second language acquisition should begin there too.
It would also seem linguistically much easier for younger children to acquire languages. In fact, if a child is learning two languages at a time, he or she will learn both at the same rate without one language inhibiting the other.
Unfortunately, the number of public elementary schools that offer foreign language education has declined from 24 percent in 1997 to 15 percent in 2008. In all middle schools, the number decreased from 75 to 58 percent. Only high schools still reinforce foreign language learning at the same rate, with 91 percent of high schools offering options to learn a foreign language.
Many attribute these cuts in language programs to the “No Child Left Behind” program, which enforces more traditional learning, like math and English-language reading, which are both undeniably fundamental to a child’s education.
But what happens to children who learn a language other than English, enter the public school system and are henceforth taught only English? The answer is that they get left behind.
“Hard facts may be a good reason to, say, shut down an old steel mill that cannot withstand competition,” an article for the Economist stated. “But language is not a steel mill. There is far more at stake: not just people’s livelihoods, but their identities and cultural diversity itself.”
Michael Alison Chandler, a mother in Washington D.C., recently wrote a piece for the Washington Post detailing her struggles with finding an education for her son that incorporates proper language instruction. Her greatest fear is that her son will lose all the bilingualism he’s learned at his advanced day care once he enters elementary and middle school. For well-off parents, private school is the best option, as private elementary schools are over three times more likely than public elementary schools to offer instruction in foreign language. For the rest of the general population, however, it becomes a battle with school boards and budget cuts in the public school system.
Dual-language immersion programs seem to offer the most hope for public schools. Instead of being taught normal classes in English and then offering a separate foreign language course, these programs provide instruction in two languages in multiple classes throughout the school day.
While these programs can be limiting in which languages they can teach in, they are certainly the most theoretically feasible programs; instead of hiring one math teacher and one foreign language teacher, schools can simply hire one math teacher who is bilingual. Perhaps they could be implemented slowly — the elementary schools with bilingual teachers available can begin immediately and those without bilingual teachers can wait until some are made available.
But the alternative, teaching only English while some estimates project that only half of the world’s population will be speaking English by 2050, is unacceptable. As a country, we cannot economically or practically afford to be left behind.
Opps, this was mostly a fair and decent read until the final paragraph.  Not sure what estimates the author is referring to that suggest a decline in English speakers by 2050 because the truth is that English is the one language heard, taught and spoken around the world.  We in the United States (and everyone whose first language is English) are truly fortunate because English has easily become the leading language in the world’s marketplace.  In countries with a different mother-tongue (like France, Germany, India, Russia, some Arab Nations, etc.) English is mandatory “foreign language” instruction. Additionally, many leaders of foreign nations were educated in the United States or Great Britain, and speak fluid English as a result.
In fact, some institutions like Aviation and certain international medical journals have declared English to be the official language.  One need only travel the globe to see that, where signs might be posted in a second language additional to the local language, it is traditionally English.
And now I will share a fact that often surprises people (one which is too-often suppressed for nefarious political reasons):  English is in fact the official language of California, as it should be.  It was codified into law several years ago, approved overwhelmingly by voters.  It makes total sense, and should be the official language of the United States.  It’s a natural derivative of our founding as a British colony.  
The author’s point remains that proficiency in a second language is useful and should continue to be a fundamental part of American education.  However, there is a strong argument to be made that proficiency in English is perhaps the most valuable tool a person can have in today’s international marketplace of economy and ideas.  There should be no vanity or pride associated with the suggestion that we are very fortunate as Americans to speak the world’s language.

Not every Disney movie is required to leave its audience a weeping, besotted mess. The animation titan’s latest feature, Big Hero 6, never reaches the soaring emotional vistas of The Lion King or even the relative poignancy of Frozen or Wreck-It Ralph, but that doesn’t stop it from being a playful, charming, visually resplendent adventure that tugs at your heartstrings without tearing them out by the roots (That’s Pixar’s job, as evidenced by the incinerator scene in Toy Story 3 and that devastating together-through-life montage in Up).
Excelsior · Big Hero 6 is the first Disney animated movie based on a Marvel property to come out since they acquired the company in 2009. — Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures
Adapted from a lesser-known Marvel property written by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau — the same creative duo who went on to produce Cartoon Network’s popular Ben 10 and Generator Rex animated shows at their studio Man of Action — and conceived as a westernized love letter to Japanese anime, Big Hero 6 centers on Hiro Hamada (voiced with great enthusiasm by Japanese-American actor Ryan Potter), a 14-year-old robotics prodigy living in the futuristic megalopolis of San Fransokyo (apparently California has fallen into the sea and collided with Japan by this point) with his ditzy Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) and equally brilliant older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney). 
The film, co-directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, opens in the midst of a fraternal power struggle. After catching Hiro squandering his talents on illegal underground robot fights, Tadashi takes his gifted but aimless sibling on a tour of the local university, a future-tech wonderland that combines the scholarly setting of MIT with the mechanical marvels of Tony Stark’s workshop. Hiro, inspired by what he sees, decides it’s now his dream to attend this “nerd school,” and Tadashi and his merry band of misfits pledge to help him win the local science fair in a bid to impress the crotchety Professor Callaghan (the always welcome James Cromwell). 
Of course, any Disney movie with a setup this aggressively mundane has to be heading towards an emotional vertical loop. Sure enough, tragedy strikes at the science fair and Tadashi dies in a mysterious explosion (Disney purposely included this plot point in the trailers in order to forewarn more sensitive viewers). Hiro, emotionally hobbled by the loss of the man who practically raised him, shuts himself off from the world and wallows in his grief until he unwittingly activates his brother’s final invention: an inflatable robotic healthcare provider named Baymax (Scott Adsit, whose not-quite-deadpan delivery is oddly endearing). 
Hoping to improve Hiro’s emotional wellbeing, the automated caregiver agrees to help the boy investigate Tadashi’s death, and before long the two would-be heroes are on the trail of a sinister masked man — no kidding, he wears an antique Kabuki mask — who might have triggered the deadly explosion as a diversion to steal Hiro’s groundbreaking science fair project: an army of swarming microbots that can form nearly any shape or substance.
Once it becomes clear that a legitimate super-villain is on the loose, Big Hero 6 loses interest in its sweet-natured but overly familiar “a boy and his robot” dynamic — overly familiar in that it borrows several key story elements from Brad Bird’s supremely underrated 1999 gem The Iron Giant — and becomes a full-tilt superhero origin story that wouldn’t feel out of place in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe, complete with high-tech costumes, a team of wisecracking crime-fighters (their individual personalities are often eerily reminiscent of Hiccup’s Viking gang in DreamWorks’ How to Train Your Dragon movies, right down to the use of T.J. Miller’s character as easy-bake comic relief) and a never-ending barrage of spectacular battle sequences. This tonal shift can’t help but feel a tad jarring, particularly when Hiro redesigns the cuddly, soft-spoken Baymax as a do-it-yourself battle bot and reveals a hitherto unmentioned vengeful streak that would have proven a lot more interesting if the movie wasn’t so quick to reign in the behavior.
The third act wisely returns the focus to the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, skillfully restoring the balance between explosive action and earnest sentiment, and the film ends on a nicely cathartic note that simultaneously leaves the door wide open for future sequels. This strong ending erases many of the picture’s more glaring flaws, but there’s still a big one worth mentioning. For a movie whose main theme seems to be overcoming the loss of a loved one, Big Hero 6 is curiously unwilling to commit to its most emotional moments, juxtaposing scenes of intense bereavement with physical sight gags and goofy one-liners from its various side characters. Compare that to The Lion King, which gave its viewers several minutes to absorb the traumatic death of Mufasa before the first appearance of Timon and Pumbaa, the animal kingdom’s answer to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Remember this, prospective screenwriters: Even the Ritalin generation needs time to grieve.
Big Hero 6 is the first Disney animated film to feature Marvel characters since the Mouse House acquired the company back in 2009, and it definitely feels like it owes more to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby than Uncle Walt. The movie is strewn with obscure comics references, from a character’s prized action figure collection to a post-credits scene that would be criminal to spoil, yet it also boasts Disney’s patented blend of humor and heart. It’s also one of the most visually striking animated movies to come along in quite some time. San Fransokyo in particular is stunning to behold, a breathtaking synthesis of Los Angeles in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner and Neo-Tokyo in Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira. Like the rest of Big Hero 6, it’s clearly made of recycled parts, but there’s no denying it wears them with style.

This year has provided a handful of masterpieces from established independent filmmakers that will surely label 2014 as the beginning of a post-blockbuster era. Director Christopher Nolan, after starting with indies like Memento and moving into complete Hollywood franchise mode, has always tried to merge the visual spectacle of blockbusters with the emotional resonance of indies to varying degrees of success. Interstellar is his broadest, grandest and most passionate directorial attempt to date. Luckily, it is also his most successful.

Nolan is clearly trying to create his masterpiece with this film. This clear intent will likely determine an audience’s acceptance or rejection of his nearly three-hour opus, although it doesn’t feel that long. There is an almost primal need evident in every frame to capture the truths of the story, the nuances of the characters and the scope of this very detailed and meticulously crafted world. His love for filmmaking as a medium is evident as he shot on film (and the IMAX 70mm presentation is simply gorgeous), but even more impressive is his consistent and surefire pacing in storytelling. Here, Nolan knows what he is doing every step of the way, and his command in presenting a narrative as complex as this is an achievement in its own right.
It is important to remember that movies can, with the proper care, replicate or reflect the world in which we live to incite deeper thought and understanding. When a film borders on reality under the pretense of a fictional plot, the effect can be momentous. Interstellar is one such experience. Nolan has always had a hard time bridging the gap between reporting and reflecting on the human experience. Most of his films show the audience a character’s struggle without demanding that they participate in it emotionally. With this film, he has finally achieved that balance. Where his other films feel distancing and almost foreign in their cinematography and tone, this feels homegrown and authentic. The use of a handheld camera puts the audience in the room with the characters, and the constant use of close-ups provides a consistent window into their emotional state. The score is foreboding and intense, shaking the seats and putting the audience in every riveting moment. Greater still is that the large set pieces aren’t the only stunning parts of this film; the quiet, human interactions are just as effective. Interstellar is immersive and begs to be seen on the largest screen possible. Because of the impressive nature of the filmmaking it is easier to forgive the film when the plot tries to accomplish too much. A more selective narrative would have sufficed.
The mild critical response to the film so far (currently sitting at a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes) is the result of the many layers it contains, and not an indication of disappointment. Nobody can deny that it is a visual feast, technically brilliant and very well-acted. Matthew McConaughey continues his winning streak with a performance that elevates this film to new heights, and Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and the other supporting characters give it their absolute all. The third act, however, is a lot to take in all at once as the film starts presenting its most confounding ideas yet. If the beginning should seem out of hand, it will only get worse from there. The trick is accepting that answers aren’t meant to be provided right away, and given its running time, they might not show up for some time. Interstellar is a journey that maintains a low rumble of intensity and only gets louder as it picks up steam. If a film of this magnitude, brazenly confident in its depiction of the possible end of humanity, didn’t leave some people feeling a little battered, it would not have gone far enough. Emotional attachment will make up for its storytelling flaws, and in the end, it is the emotion that will be remembered long after the credits roll.
The film is dense, there is no way around it. The science of the adventure is presented in its every detail, and while it is thought-provoking and entirely necessary, some audiences are going to wonder why they are being intellectually challenged in a tentpole studio release. This is the true success of Interstellar. It represents a shift, parallel to the rise of independents, where studios are becoming more and more willing to take risks in order to present compelling stories since, given the floundering summer box office, it would appear that audiences are wising up. No longer will people shell out the ever-increasing cost of movie tickets just to see a film they will surely forget about five minutes after they leave the theater. Every now and again people need an escape, but films like Interstellar prove that there is a place for intelligent and auteur-driven fare at the multiplex. One can only hope that its place will grow.
