The Undergraduate Student Government granted the Middle Eastern and North African Student Association official programming assembly status at its Senate meeting Tuesday night. After undergoing a trial period over this semester, during which it proved a strong campus presence, MENASA will now have access to funding and support from USG. 
MENASA is currently working to hire professional staff for the MENA lounge — including an embedded MENA therapist — and adding a MENA race category on forms and applications. 
Patricia Gerges, director of community outreach for MENASA and a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said having these resources and proper representation for MENA students is important because they can make more accurate assessments of their well-being. Gerges explained that MENA student data in publications such as student well-being reports is not accurately communicated in studies because of the lack of their own racial category.
“The lack of a category really is like an invisible barrier,” Gerges said. “The problem is when these people get admitted, that reflects on the University’s overall census and demographics.”
Sami Andari, director of external affairs for MENASA and a junior majoring in chemical engineering, also said MENASA not having status as a programming assembly under USG is part of what bars the MENA community from gaining access to resources that other student communities have.
“We’re not given some of the resources other assemblies have, like dorm floors, funding for big events and whatnot. It’s all things we really don’t have access to,” Andari said. “We believe that the main cause of that is us not being recognized as a racial category on these forms.”
Anthony Khoory, MENASA’s co-executive director and a senior majoring in sociology, said he believes the approval of MENASA as an official programming assembly will allow for their projects to move forward.
The expansion of the MENA lounge, which is located in the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, into a larger center is a goal that has been on MENA students’ minds for some time, Khoory and Gerges said.
“The space is not adequate enough, and it doesn’t suffice,” Gerges said. “There was a march for Mahsa Amini, the woman killed by the morality police in Iran, and a lot of Persian students were there demonstrating. They were all gathered in the MENA lounge and space, but it could not fit them all.”
Khoory said that continuing to push for the completion of these goals, such as the lounge expansion, is within the realm of possibility. 
“The student lounge was created after advocacy based on the coalition that I had made, which ended up becoming MENASA,” Khoory said. “The lounge was not something the [University] decided to make. It was because we had advocated for it since 2019.”
During their trial period, MENASA has shown a strong presence on campus and have held a number of on-campus events centered around involvement, racial inclusivity and advocacy. MENASA has several more events planned, including networking events, workshops, a MENA bash and activities with other organizations which are meant to increase MENA engagement on campus.
Andari said MENASA has been working hard to get these initiatives lined up in progress this semester.
 “We’re hosting many events and having events with other assemblies as well and just trying our best to legitimize ourselves on campus,” Andari said.
Andari also said it has not been an easy journey for MENASA to be incorporated as a programming assembly, but the support they have been receiving from USC has been helpful in guiding MENASA on what goals are achievable and connecting them with people who can help them make the changes they are striving for. 
“We’ve had many people at USC that were really helpful and really understanding, but we understand their limitations and what they can’t do,” Andari said. “We want to work with them.”
Gerges said there are multiple steps that must be taken before an assembly can become a part of USG, including the initial voting approval from various committees and then the Senate which decides if the assembly can stay a part of the programming committee.
“It’s not like any cultural organization is going to be part of USG,” Gerges said. “You have to present, you have to show them that you deserve it and that you are worthy of being there.”

Los Angeles mayoral candidates Rep. Karen Bass and developer Rick Caruso faced off in their final televised debate on Tuesday, during which they largely focused on several City Councilmembers’ racist remarks in a recently leaked audio tape.
Both candidates expressed their disapproval over the comments that Councilmembers Gil Cedillo, Kevin de León and Nury Martinez made with Ron Herrera, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor president, last October in a conversation about redistricting.
“They went into a back room to carve up this city for their own special interests, for themselves,” Caruso said in his opening statement Tuesday. “The system is broken, and it’s full of corruption. I’ve been talking about this since the beginning of the campaign.”
Caruso, who served as chair of the USC Board of Trustees until Feb. 15, used his remarks as an opportunity to condemn the current leadership, a message he’s echoed throughout this campaign to support his election as a businessman who has held few political positions.
Kevina Collins, a senior majoring in political science and history who serves as the vice president of VoteSC, said the “trend of people who are not in politics going into politics” explains Caruso’s firmness in his outsider perspective. 
“People who feel disheartened by the government or lack trust in the government see somebody who is from the outside, and see them in a more positive light,” she said.
Bass, a 2015 graduate of the Peck School of Social Work, took the controversy as an opportunity to pledge her support for combating racial injustice in L.A.
“It is important to take stock, but it’s more important to move forward,” Bass said at the debate. “I have spent my life bringing communities together in times of crisis to tackle difficult problems, including racial conflicts. And especially at this moment, we need leaders who will bring Los Angeles together and move the city forward.”
Caruso attempted to tie Bass to the scandal in his Oct. 9 statement.
“Most of the people involved in this ugly episode have endorsed Karen Bass,” he said. “I hope she’ll do the right thing and demand for their accountability and renounce the endorsement of those who used hate speech.” 
At the time of Caruso’s statement, Martinez had endorsed Bass, while Cedillo had endorsed Caruso. Neither de León nor Herrera officially endorsed a candidate. 
Bass’s website no longer cites Martinez as an endorsement, but Caruso has not renounced Cedillo’s endorsement. Martinez and Herrera are the only ones to step down from their positions despite calls from both Bass and Caruso as well as President Joe Biden for the remaining councilmembers to resign.
Sophia Perez, a junior majoring in political science who serves as the executive director of the Political Student Assembly, said that while the scandal was hurtful, it may help with voter turnout in next month’s election.
“While it was hard to see and hard to hear as a minority, I think it could actually help voter turnout because people want to have a say in who they elect,” Perez said. “Students can rally against it.”
“While it was hard to see and hard to hear as a minority, I think it could actually help voter turnout because people want to have a say in who they elect. Students can rally against it.”
Both Perez and Collins said that voters should still do their own research to understand candidates’ policies and backgrounds.
“It’s also important to do research into their political stances entirely and their past political support,” Collins said. “If they’re not a politician and don’t have any experience in legislation, what is their voting record? Who have they voted for? What have they said in the past about certain policy issues?”
Perez added that Bass is not solely responsible for the lack of progress in L.A., as Caruso often characterizes.
“There’s a lot of bureaucratic engagement that goes into the policies that come out in Los Angeles,” Perez said. “However, when [Caruso] is saying that billions of dollars are funneled into homelessness campaigns every single year and nothing is getting done, he was correct in that statement.”
The Associated Press reported Monday that Caruso had upped his campaign spending to encourage voter turnout with just under a month until election day, which will take place Nov. 8.
Caruso has spent $62.6 million so far compared to Bass’s $6 million, according to the L.A. City Ethics Commission. Recent investments include additional canvassers, door-to-door volunteers and political bankers targeting Latinx, Asian and independent voters.
