The Undergraduate Student Government Elections Committee held three hearings Thursday and Friday regarding the Elections Code, including allegedly voting on behalf of another student, posting campaign materials on sidewalks and lamp posts and not including official USG logos on their campaign materials.
The committee gathered Friday after a canvasser for presidential candidate Trenton Stone and vice presidential candidate Mahin Tahsin allegedly took a student’s phone and voted on their behalf. The Elections Commission unanimously voted against the complaint, stating that a violation of the Elections Code had not occured. 
“All of the 32 canvassers … have sent me a text saying sometimes [they’d] interact but had never hit submit,” Stone said at the meeting. 
According to Stone, canvassers handed out flyers with a QR code that linked students to the election voting page, which often required assistance from the canvassers themselves.
“I thought what I had seen was them taking someone’s phone out of their hands, but I wasn’t sure,” said Michaela Murphy, a presidential candidate who spoke at the hearing. “It felt like something that should be more explicitly resolved because it was the end of the voting period at that point.” 
Murphy took three photos of the interaction between the canvasser and the students, which were presented in the hearing.
“I think, overall, it was a misunderstanding because we did send out information to the canvassers beforehand,” Stone said. “They might have helped navigate with that QR code issue, but otherwise they’ve all promised they never once submitted a vote or anything like that.” 
Murphy said she wanted to speak up about the alleged incident in case one of Stone and Tahsin’s canvassers didn’t understand USG’s rules. 
“I believe in the integrity of [Stone and Tahsin’s] campaign.” Murphy said at the beginning of the hearing. “But it felt not right sitting on it, just in case it was an oversight or a canvasser who wasn’t understanding of the rules.” 
The committee also held a hearing Thursday after a complaint was filed  against presidential candidate Maxwell Brandon and vice presidential candidate Grayson Adler’s for posting campaign material on a lamp and for not including the USG logo on their campaign materials. 
The policy requires that all visual campaign materials contain an unedited USG logo. Candidates are also prohibited from posting campaign material on University Housing facilities, in addition to lamp posts, trees, hedges, trash cans and parking structures, according to the Elections Code.
The committee unanimously voted that the campaign violated the election code and sentenced the Brandon-Adler campaign with a one day deduction of digital campaigning.
On Thursday, the committee also held a hearing for a complaint filed against senatorial candidate Quinn Cunniff whose campaign included materials that were taped to the ground. The policy states campaign materials cannot be taped to or covering the ground. 
The committee also unanimously decided that Cunniff violated the election code. He was similarly sentenced with a one day deduction of digital campaigning. 
Cunniff faced a hearing the day before, when students filed a complaint against him because his campaign materials included references to O.J. Simpson’s criminal trial. Cunniff had posted a sign on Trousdale Parkway showing a picture of himself mimicking Simpson putting on a black glove, with the caption “If the glove doesn’t fit, you must commit … to voting Cunniff for Senate.”
No students could be reached for comment because election policy prevents any USG member or anyone affiliated with a campaign from speaking to the press regarding a hearing.

Provost Michael Quick announced the creation of a Task Force on University Nomenclature Monday. The group will be responsible for defining a set of principles and processes for faculty, staff and students to submit concerns regarding campus building names, symbols and monuments, according to a memo sent to the USC community.
Paula Cannon, a professor of molecular microbiology and former president of the Academic Senate and Ainsley Carry, vice president of Student Affairs, will lead the task force.
“As we grow as a university community and as we grow as a nation, we are having important conversations about the names of certain buildings, monuments and symbols,” Quick wrote. “Many of these from our past may evoke views and practices that we no longer support and may cause pain for members of our community.” 
Carry said the decision to create the task force comes on the heels of a national movement across many American universities to rethink the names of campus landmarks that may threaten certain populations. 
“This has been part of a national movement … for a number of institutions like ourselves, including Michigan, Yale, Princeton, Harvard and Stanford,” Carry told the Daily Trojan. “They have done exactly what we are getting ready to do … through whatever [ways] it came to their attention … so University’s had to create a process to interrogate this.” 
Though the official Task Force was announced Monday, the Undergraduate and Graduate student governments previously passed resolutions in requesting the administration to acknowledge USC’s troubled history and to facilitate open discussions to reexamine building names.
“Last spring, USG passed a resolution about changing the name of [Von KleinSmid Center] and in conjunction with that over the summer, myself and Emmett wrote a resolution that the GSG executive board put out about … the history of racism on campus,” said Quinn Anex-Ries, GSG’s director of diversity and equity advocacy. “[We] both worked together to result in the creation of the University Task Force.” 
Many students and organizations have called on the University to change the name of Von KleinSmid Center — a building named after USC’s fifth president, Rufus B. Von KleinSmid, an active member of the eugenics movement who advocated for forced sterilization practices. 
“The University itself needs a systemized way of changing things,” Anex-Ries said. “More specifically, [the Task Force] allows for us to create the framework to have more complex conversations across the University about why it is even important to consider why something is named.” 
While the task force does not deal with a particular building or name, its members will help develop a way for the USC community to voice their concerns regarding campus nomenclature. 
“The principles should be broad enough to be applied to a variety of circumstances rather than tailored to a particular issue or controversy, and the Task Force should not deal with any particular issue or controversy,” Quick wrote. “The Task Force should weigh all relevant considerations and develop criteria for making such decisions.” 
Carry said the task force is meant to outline the sequence of steps students, faculty and staff can take to help the University address change.
“Let me emphasize, this task force will not end in a result,” Carry said. “There will not be any specific name changes as a result of this task force, but what will be crystal clear is a step by step sequence of how members in our community … can submit a request for that level of interrogation.” 
The Task Force comprises nine architecture, design, public policy, philosophy, history and law professors, as well as three undergraduate and two graduate students. 
Anex-Ries said he is pleased with the diversity of voices represented on the task force. 
“I definitely think [the task force] is a group that will definitely have very spirited debate,” Anex-Ries said. “Of course, I would always love to see more students on the task force, but for USC and for previous instances, I actually am impressed with the breadth of people they have been able to put on the task force.” 
Shaghayegh Ebadi, co-chief diversity director of USG, said the task force is a necessary step toward increasing support for marginalized communities on campus. 
“Tough conversations must be had on the impact of the various monuments and symbols that we administer across campus, but the work cannot stop at mere conversations,” Ebadi wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “A mission statement praising equity and diversity ultimately loses its value if an administration cannot effectively implement action to change its own harmful practices.” 
Ebadi said she hopes the task force will also shed light on historical injustice at the University.
“This task force must embody a progressive mission to shed light on USC’s … cultural hegemony that continue to harm our marginalized student communities,” Ebadi wrote. “New naming policies must be developed to address these inequities alongside formative solutions and help guide the University into an age of true commitment to diversity and inclusion.”

Lisa Gersh, former CEO of luxury fashion label Alexander Wang, discussed common trends in fashion and lifestyle design in the business sector Monday at an event hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s Media, Economics and Entrepreneurship Women’s Leadership Society. Gersh spoke about ways women can advance their professional careers in the fashion industry and about methods to adapt to new intersections of media and fashion.
During the event, Gersh highlighted the importance of gender diversity in the workplace and said it was vital to include multiple women in meetings and business decisions.
“It changes the conversation for women, when there’s other women in the room,” Gersh said. “It makes it so much easier.” 
The event was moderated by Andie Wright and Maya Kashlan, both seniors majoring in public relations. The moderators said they hope hearing from Gersh will encourage young women to advance their careers and secure more executive positions.
“We’re really dedicated to recruiting female professionals to come and talk to our members and the public about their career paths and hopefully inspire them,” Wright said. “Lisa is amazing … her cross-platform career where she’s worked in media and she’s worked in fashion, and she’s held such high roles in these companies — so a very diverse perspective.” 
According to Gersh, the rise in popularity of the social media and internet news has led to rapid changes in fashion and advertising. Aspiring fashion professionals must learn how to merge media with business, she said. Many companies are struggling because they fail to use social media to promote fashion shows and products.
“I think people are really struggling [to change] because it used be so formulaic — you bought five pages of a magazine, you had a fashion show,” Gersh said. “I think it’s really challenging for the fashion business, in order to figure out really how to get noticed.” 
Gersh reflected on her own experience as CEO of Alexander Wang, and she offered advice for women who intend to pursue a leadership role in the future.
“If leadership is something that attracts you, then that’s the path you want to be on,” she said. “Doing different things is … a really good path to becoming a CEO … getting really good at [a task] and completing the task is really important before you move up.” 
Gersh said young students who want to work in fashion media should use their knowledge of social media to help companies market their products to younger demographics.
“It’s a really rapidly changing field, and I think people who are thinking about going into marketing should be thinking about social [media],” Gersh said. “That’s really where all the dollars are going and the 42-year-olds can’t figure it out.” 
In addition to business advice, Gersh also discussed her background and journey to becoming a fashion and media specialist. She began as a lawyer, but soon managed to secure executive positions at PopSugar entertainment media company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and NBC Universal.
Marilyn Zhang, a freshman majoring in journalism, asked for Gersh’s perspective on how to balance passion in a career.
“I don’t think you should try to balance your passion,” Gersh said. “I think you’re looking at a career path — it’s something you’re really excited about, something that really drives you. You should find a way in and go in that direction.” 
WLS member Anam Faruqi said she enjoyed learning about business and the fashion industry through Gersh’s experiences.
“I think it was really enriching … I think she gave us a lot of insight about what it means to be a leader and just the business industry in general,” Faruqi, a freshman majoring in communications, said. “I also thought it was very interesting the way she has jumped around so much in her career.”

Iovine and Young Academy freshman Skylar Thomas realized that he wanted to channel his creative energy toward building interactive worlds and characters after designing his first virtual reality game for the 2016 Google Science Fair. Originally a two-dimensional illustrator, the young virtual reality developer and artist found that three-dimensional mediums can enhance viewers’ relationships with art by immersing them in a different reality.
“You’re building worlds,” Thomas said. “3-D transforms to immersive environments and characters you can interact with and navigate your way through.” 
This semester, Thomas is working on his current project, “LittleBot,” in collaboration with Oculus VR, a prominent VR software and equipment company. “LittleBot’s” narrative concept features a robot character navigating a dying universe.
“[The game sprawls] a dystopian universe where you’re guided by this character called ‘LittleBot,’” Thomas said. “The health of the character is tied to the health of the world.” 
Based on the user’s actions, LittleBot can replace the decrepit landscape around him with growing plants and trees.
“The premise is that we are consuming more than we’re creating these days,” Thomas said. “It’s an interactive time lapse. As you scrub through, you see the world continually dying, if you go in one direction. Then, depending on the user’s actions, the world slowly revives, and so does the character.” 
Thomas said he has been designing “LittleBot” for over a year, and he has changed the layout of the game many times throughout the creative process.
“[The game] was originally for augmented reality, but I realized it wasn’t really suited to that medium,” Thomas said. “I was building a world and it needed to be [immersive] and not on an iPhone.” 
The sp[a]ce gallery at Ayzenberg, an art nonprofit in Pasadena known for its VR pieces, will debut Thomas’ game in its robot-themed May 2019 exhibition.
Thomas volunteered at the sp[a]ce gallery during a show featuring a mixture of virtual and augmented reality in October 2017. His expertise in VR headsets led him to get involved in the gallery as an artist. 
The gallery’s manager, Wendy Sherman, is currently working on a deal with Oculus VR to sponsor Thomas’ project, which will run through September 2019.
Sherman said she loves working with Thomas because of his commitment to the craft.
“He’s fantastic,” Sherman said. “He’s up for anything and has a lot of energy.  He’s really great with people and showing them the equipment.” 
The Progressors, a traveling art show along the West Coast, will also showcase “LittleBot” in its exhibit in late spring. The show’s theme is “Art for Progress.” It will encompass paintings bookended by Thomas’ VR experience.
“Skylar’s project is attached to this bigger project,” said Progressors member Isa D’Arleans. “The VR is about saving the planet. When I met Skylar … I was just fascinated by him and how bright he is. He is the perfect Progressor.” 
The term “Progressor” applies to both the artworks and the creators involved in the movement. 
“The Progressors are the paintings and the Progressors are the people helping with the project,” D’Arleans said. “Skylar is … a visionary. I know that whatever he comes up with is going to be amazing. I trust his vision, 100 percent.” 
Thomas said he looks to other professionals in the field of 2-D and 3-D illustration — like illustrator and animator Ash Thorp or graphic design firm DKNG Studios — for inspiration.
“I drew comics and cartoons for so many years and so my 3-D style is really, inherently cartoonish, and everything is very colorful,” Thomas said. 
Thomas said the Iovine and Young Academy honed his artistic skills and gave him not only the concrete tools and resources he needs to succeed in his endeavors but also a cohort of brilliant individuals to work with.
“The Academy has been fantastic in that I’ve got to meet 26 of the coolest people that I’ve ever come in contact with,” Thomas said. “They’re an amazing collection of artists and coders and product developers. They’re all so different, and they have skills I don’t have.”

The Trojan track and field team continued its dominant start to the 2019 season this weekend at the Tyson Invitational in Fayetteville, Ark. Pitted against stiff competition from the SEC, Big Ten and Big 12 conferences, the Trojans compiled four first-place finishes and rewrote the USC track and field record books. 
Sophomore hurdler Cameron Samuel secured the first of the Trojans’ top-three finishes over the course of the weekend, earning third place in the men’s 400-meter hurdles with a time of 47.46 seconds. 
Three Trojans qualified for the finals of the women’s 60-meter hurdles. Sophomore sprinter and hurdler Chanel Brissett followed her first-place finish at the Texas Tech Invitational last week with another victory in Fayetteville, setting a personal record and earning the second-fastest time in USC history, with a time of 7.9 seconds. Junior Anna Cockrell and redshirt senior Dior Hall finished in sixth and seventh place with times of 8.15 and 8.17, respectively. 
In the men’s 60-meter hurdles, freshman Ayden Owens set consecutive personal bests and USC freshman records in both the qualifying round and finals. Owen’s final time of 7.83 seconds was good for sixth place, both at the meet and in USC history for the event. 
USC extended its prolific sprinting results to the women’s 60-meter dash. Sprinters sophomore TeeTee Terry and freshman Lanae-Tava Thomas both advanced to the final round of the event despite a crowded field. Terry clocked in at 7.25 seconds to earn a third-place finish, while Thomas finished seventh with a time of 7.36 seconds. 
Freshman sprinter Brendon Stewart added to USC’s tally of top-three finishes, as his time of 6.64 seconds earned him second place in the men’s 60-meter dash. 
Junior distance runner Chloe Berry burst ahead on the final straightaway of the women’s one-mile race to complete a come-from-behind win by a thin margin of 0.37 seconds. 
A pair of Trojan freshmen registered impressive finishes in the women’s 800-meter race. Freshman distance runner Jemima Russell took home first place while breaking the USC freshman record for the event with a time of 2:05.90, and fellow freshman distance runner Alyssa Brewer, the previous USC freshman record-holder, clocked in at 2:07.88 to finish fourth. 
On the men’s side, junior Matthew Myrtue set a new personal record and climbed to sixth on the USC records list in the men’s 800-meter race by registering a 1:51.64 finish. 
Junior sprinter Kyra Constantine helped the Trojans end the first day of competition on a high note, securing USC’s fourth first-place finish of the meet with a time of 53.07 in the women’s 400-meter race. 
On Saturday, the Trojans sustained their success at the invitational with strong results in the field events and relays. Sophomore jumper Cassidy Palka tied for third place and moved up the rankings to eighth in USC history by clearing the 1.67-meter bar in the women’s high jump. 
The women’s 4×400-meter relay team passed the University of Florida’s team on the anchor leg to finish in first place with a time of 3:30.43, while the men’s 4×400 meter relay team clocked in at 3:06.78 to come in fourth. 
With the No. 2 women’s team and No. 11 men’s team nationally, USC aims to build off last weekend’s impressive showing with the beginning of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championships in Seattle on Feb. 22.

More than halfway into Pac-12 play, the USC women’s basketball team is currently sitting near the bottom of the standings. This past weekend, the Trojans went on a road trip to No. 17 Utah and Colorado, splitting their games with an 84-80 victory over the Utes and an 81-76 loss to the Buffaloes. 
Head coach Mark Trakh’s Trojans entered Friday’s matchup with Utah coming off two straight wins over Washington and Washington State. USC was 3-7 in Pac-12 play, with its only previous win coming against UCLA. 
Senior guard Mariya Moore had a big game early in the Utah matchup, putting up 8 quick points to give USC an early lead. The score at the end of the first quarter was 23-19 USC, after eight lead changes in the first 10 minutes. Moore said she bought into the green-light mentality despite the team’s recent shooting struggles.
“It’s hard to be in the gym so much and not hit shots, but we are just at the point where, it’s like, at least we are confident now whether we make it or miss it,” Moore said.
USC shot 54 percent from the field and 50 percent from beyond the arc in the first half. Redshirt sophomore forward Asiah Jones and the Trojans took charge on the glass, leading the Utes 21-11. Jones had five rebounds for the game, four of which came on offense. 
At halftime, Moore had 16 points in 20 minutes for the Trojans, equaling Utah redshirt freshman guard Dru Gylten. Moore hit three 3-pointers, shooting 75 percent. She also added three rebounds to her total, while senior guard Aliyah Mazyck forced two steals. 
At the beginning of the third quarter, the Trojans extended their lead to 10 points with a shot from Mariya Moore. After trailing by as many as 14 points, the Utes entered the final quarter down 68-59.
Utah started the fourth quarter with a quick 5-1 run and lead, narrowing its deficit to 4 points in the first minute and a half. After three more baskets, the Utes tied the game at 68 points with under seven minutes left in regulation. 
With USC up by 3 points in the last 30 seconds, junior guard Minyon Moore stole an inbound pass from graduate student guard Sarah Porter and hit two free throws. However, Utah hit a quick 3-pointer and stole the inbound pass with 13 seconds to play. Mariya Moore blocked the potential game-winning three, sealing the Trojans’ victory. 
Mariya Moore finished with 23 points on 66 percent shooting in 39 minutes of action, but her biggest play came on the other side of the ball. 
“I’ve got to sprint with all my effort, I can’t let her get the three off, so I just jump as high as I could,” Moore said. “It probably doesn’t look like I got high up, but I tried to jump as high as I could, and I guess I just tipped it.” 
The Trojans finished their road trip at Colorado Sunday. The Buffaloes, who hadn’t won a game in conference play to that point, dominated the Trojans for most of the game, emerging victorious in a high-scoring affair.
The game was close until the fourth quarter when the Buffaloes started to run away with the lead. The Trojans were able to close it to a 1-point deficit in the last minute of the game, but the Buffaloes closed the game out at the free throw line. 
Although USC suffered its eighth Pac-12 loss on the season, the Moore sisters continued to play at a high level. The sisters combined for 41 points, 13 rebounds and three steals against the Buffaloes. In addition, Minyon Moore played the entire game, while Mariya only missed two minutes.
Another standout player was junior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley, who scored 14 points in less than 30 minutes. Tapley missed just two shots and snagged six rebounds. 
“I’m very proud of myself,” Tapley said. “I’ve really have been focusing on the game and how I played, not really worried about the other negative things going around me.”
For the Buffaloes, the double whammy of sophomore guard Mya Hollingshed and senior guard Alexis Robinson kept the Trojans at bay, combining for 37 points and 11 rebounds. Hollingshed and Robinson had a strong game on both sides of the ball, draining a combined six 3-pointers and forcing five turnovers. 
The Women of Troy are now 14-9 overall, with six more games to play until the Pac-12 tournament. They will return home this weekend with important matches against Cal and Stanford Friday and Sunday, respectively, at Galen Center.

The No. 1 women’s water polo team won its sixth straight Triton Invitational title this weekend in La Jolla.
The Trojans took down Pomona-Pitzer 15-4 Saturday to kick off the weekend. Eleven Trojans scored in the victory over the Sagehens, and USC allowed no goals in the entire first half of the game — it entered the third period up 12-0. The Sagehens mustered some offense in the second half, but USC’s early lead allowed it to take the game easily.
USC moved on to defeat No. 15 Loyola Marymount in its second match Saturday. The Trojans leaped to a 3-0 lead over the Lions right out of the gate, and they kept their scoring momentum throughout the match. Junior utility Maud Megens and freshman driver Alejandra Anzar each had hat tricks, and eight other scoring Trojans contributed to the 16-5 victory.
On Sunday, the Trojans moved on to the semifinal match against No. 11 Michigan, winning 10-3 for their second victory over the Wolverines this season. Michigan kept the Trojans in check early, tying the score at 2-2 to start the match. USC allowed Michigan only one more goal in the third period, shutting them out in both the second and fourth periods. Megens led the Trojans offensively with 4 goals, and senior goalie Amanda Longan anchored the defense with 14 saves.
Longan said the team could have been more focused defensively against the Wolverines.
“I think our awareness of when to help and when to switch defensively was a little delayed, so the faster that happens, the faster we can recover from mistakes,” she said. 
In its final match of the weekend, USC advanced to the championship game against undefeated crosstown rival No. 3 UCLA. The Trojans shut out the Bruins in the first half, bringing the score to 6-0. Longan had 11 saves for the match, while sophomore driver Paige Hauschild and junior driver Denise Mammolito netted 3 goals each to lead the offense. UCLA never came close to the Trojans, who finished with a decisive 10-3 victory to claim the tournament title. 
Four games in two days can be a daunting task for some teams, but not the Trojans, who swept their competition throughout the weekend with ease. 
“I’ve found that if you actually put in the work to prepare, and during the week you think about who you’re going to match up against, then you’re a lot more confident and mentally prepared when you go into the weekend and playing four games doesn’t seem as bad,” Longan said.
Throughout the weekend, the Trojans spread their scoring among many players. 
“I think offensively we were very well-rounded shooting-wise,” Longan said. “We have a lot of freshmen that actually play this year that are brand new, some of them just came this semester. What’s great is that in your first year, you’re usually a little timid to try things or offensively you just become a little bit more timid, but everybody had a presence shooting-wise.”
Longan said the Trojans will focus on game fundamentals moving forward.
“If everybody has those fundamentals to go in and be able to play any role, then we’re just a lot more well-rounded and better off,” Longan said. “So I think for us the focus on the fundamentals and how we defend one-on-one and how we contribute to the offense is something we talk about all the time, and just being a better adjusting team.”
The Trojans remain at home this week to match up against the Chinese International Team for the second time this season in an exhibition game Tuesday at 5 p.m. They will then host Indiana for a conference match Saturday at 4 p.m. The Hoosiers are new to the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference.
USC will host both teams at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center this week.

There is hardly anything more American in this world than the combination of wings, beer and football. 
Most Sundays throughout the fall, millions of Americans like me crowd around our television sets around 1 p.m. EST and begin the three to eight-hour long odyssey of drama and intrigue, success and failure that occurs around the nation. 
While I was gladly able to enjoy my fall afternoons binging “Red Zone” and watching my fantasy football team ascend to the highest peaks, my experience with this year’s NFL Playoffs was far different than anything I had previously encountered. 
As a student in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, I was afforded the opportunity to spend my spring semester in London. As exciting as it is to travel the world and immerse myself in a culture vastly different from that of Southern California, I have still sought out ways to remain in touch with the beautiful sport of (American) football. The results have been nothing short of eye-opening.
Since the New York Giants defeated the Miami Dolphins in a sleepy 13-10 game on a particularly rainy day at London’s Wembley Stadium in October 2007, the NFL has not just retained but expanded on a particular interest in bringing the sport and the NFL brand to audiences in the U.K.
What this interest traces back to is often not exactly clear: Was it the high production quality of the game? The 81,000-plus screaming Europeans at Wembley? The 131-yard output from Giants running back and future Super Bowl champion Brandon Jacobs? Whatever it was, the League and Brits alike were intrigued by what they saw on that October afternoon. In the decade since, the NFL International Series has only grown in size, frequency and popularity.
Featuring pre-game acts from the likes of Calvin Harris, Train and Ne-Yo, the series has scheduled at least one game in London every year since 2007, growing to as many as four games in 2016, with another four slated for 2019. By the end of next season, the Green Bay Packers will be the only team that hasn’t kicked off on the Queen’s turf, as the league has sought to not only showcase the game and league as a whole but also ensure that all franchises are given the opportunity to present themselves abroad.
In recent years, the rhetoric coming from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggests that there is not only an interest in putting a football franchise in London, but that it is one of the league’s top priorities.
As an American, I was initially rather skeptical of this seemingly unnecessary song and dance put on by the league. Not only did the International Series come off as, at best, a cheesy exhibition akin to the MLB opening seasons in Japan, it even struck me as an incredibly destructive force in a team’s schedule that often knocked two teams outside of playoff contention further off course. As a massive fan of the Baltimore Ravens, I was not happy when they were chosen to play in September 2017. After waking up at 6 a.m. PST for kickoff, I was even more upset when they lost 44-7, the largest margin of defeat in the franchise’s history.
Coming across the pond, I was truly expecting the worst. I assumed people would be completely incapable of understanding the game’s rules. As it turned out, I was wrong.
For the Ravens wild-card round playoff game against the Chargers, I decided to head to what was labeled as an “NFL” pub and found 30 people decked out in purple and blue jerseys. While the crowd certainly included a few Americans, I had the opportunity to talk to locals and understand how their fandom developed. In a lot of ways, the stories they shared weren’t all too different from mine. 
As a Florida native, my love for the Ravens came first from family but second from watching the likes of Ray Lewis and Ed Reed terrorize offenses on Sundays. The Londoners I met shared a similar story in which they were drawn to the familiarity of team sports like soccer or rugby but fell in love with the personalities and generational talents of American football.
Even walking around the city, it is obvious that the NFL has made a lasting impact on British sports fans. Whether it be the Jaguars, Seahawks, Eagles or even the lowly Buccaneers, locals have shown a serious interest in the sport.
The most impressive aspect of British sports culture is the passion its fans have for teams and cities that are located thousands of miles away. Whether it’s rooted in their historical interest in soccer or attraction to the fast-paced, high-impact game of football, fans of all teams hark back to one unifying concept of fandom: loyalty. Through thick and thin (and fans of the six-time London host Jacksonville Jaguars have seen a lot of the latter over the past year), these fans remain absolute in their devotion to a single team.
Whether the NFL will find success in officially planting its flag in the British capital remains to be seen. The money, travel logistics and television rights certainly make it a more difficult venture than most. But if anything is certain, it’s that the fans in this city are ready for professional football. 
And sometime in the not-so-distant future, wings, beer and football may not be strictly American.

With just two weeks left until the 91st Academy Awards on Feb. 24, everyone who actually takes them seriously (including yours truly) is scrambling to watch (or rewatch) the nominated films. I personally haven’t yet caught up with all of the Best Actor/Actress performances or Foreign Film nominees only because I’m busy rewatching the Best Picture nominees, straining to make sense of the bunch. 
In my last column, I looked at the sociopolitical nature of four of the Best Picture nominees and discussed how their inclusion in the category reflects the Academy’s shift toward recognizing socially conscious and relevant films (or at least those that put on a facade of social consciousness).
Now, we have to reckon with the other four nominees — “Roma,” “The Favourite,” “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “A Star is Born” — because the winner may be one of them. 
Instead of socio-political films, here we have movies about the arts: two films about music and two about, well, film (specifically, what film can be when it’s at its best). The dichotomy here is startling and fascinating: While two of them are wildly popular and beloved by fans, the other two are untouchable critical darlings. 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” has baffled the minds of film buffs everywhere, leaving them confused about the Academy’s serious consideration of  a historically askew biopic shrouded in Bryan Singer’s sexual misconduct allegations. It’s murky ground to tread, but that had absolutely no effect on “Rhapsody’s” supporters. According to Box Office Mojo, it finished as the 12th highest-grossing picture of 2018. 
The Freddie Mercury/Queen biopic is a fascinating case study. Its vehement defenders turn a deaf ear to the critics —  they take a “haters will say it’s fake” stance but actually mean it. The film’s unforeseen lifespan is arguably the main reason it has recieved far more accolades than anyone (including, presumably, the filmmakers themselves) ever expected. 
Part, if not all, of “Bohemian Rhapsody’s” mass appeal is in its subject matter. Throw the titular song on at any given moment and you’ll inject a new energy into any gathering. I’d even go a step further — throw any Queen song on and you’ll get the same result. Good music (and good music played loudly in a theater) has the power to make a bad film sort of good. Nevertheless, “Bohemian Rhapsody” isn’t the only musical up for Best Picture. 
“A Star is Born” is a cathartic tale of love and heartbreak — two film themes that never get old. Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut sits in a sweet spot that any big studio project covets: It is both acclaimed and admired, technically praised and emotionally appreciated. While “Bohemian Rhapsody” fits the latter, it falls significantly short when it comes to the former. 
On the other hand, “Roma” and “The Favourite” are both critically praised, but have likely fallen under the average moviegoer’s radar. (It’s safe to say a black-and-white foreign film and a historical dark dramedy are slightly less appealing than watching Queen or Lady Gaga.)
Before the nominations were announced, “A Star is Born” was the general consensus pick to win Best Picture. Both “Roma” and “The Favourite” have received 10 nominations each, a good sign the Academy is absolutely not passing them by. Combine that with the lack of recognition “A Star is Born” is getting from other major awards shows and it looks like the Academy isn’t as hot for Cooper as was expected. 
It all comes down to this: “Roma” — a minimalistic tale of an unspoken inner-life. “The Favourite” — a triangular power struggle for the ages. One is quiet, the other loud. One is about a humble protagonist, the other about a prideful bunch. Both are meticulously crafted,  staged, filmed and immaculately acted. 
They aren’t extremely popular, but, at least in their minds, the Academy has already paid respect to popular films just by placing “Black Panther” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” in its most prestigious category. 
In the end, the Oscars will please some and disappoint others. But before that happens, it’s up to each individual to decide what they want to see in the Oscars:  a service to the masses in which popularity trumps quality, or a decisive measure of the true Best Picture.

Visions and Voices presented the third and final showing of “Race Relay” at the California African American Museum Sunday. The play was co-sponsored by the museum and organized by associate professor of theatre practice Anita Dashiell-Sparks, Price Director of Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives LaVonna Lewis and associate professor of film and television production Helaine Head.
“Race Relay” is an interactive theatrical multimedia project about race relations by writer and director Denise Hamilton. Since its creation in 2005, the production has been developed for four different locations. The CAAM performance incorporates real stories on race directly from the USC community, alongside various media meant to prompt introspection and conversation.
The seating arrangement in the theater immediately made it clear that this would not be a traditional performance. All of the chairs formed a circle, so guests faced one another while watching the performance in the center of the circle.
The performance commenced with instruction from Christo Pellani, a drummer/percussionist who prompted the audience to pick up the percussion instruments under their seats and play to his beat. Music and movement were woven through the entire performance, which aimed to unify the audience.
“See how the drums are bringing us all together in here … We are creating this unity, no matter what our age, our background,” Pellani said.
After the music died out, six actors entered the circle and related stories about racism experienced by all minorities.
Jessica Burgess, a freshman theatre major, shared a real blog post created by a white mother raising black children. In it, the mother tries to explain the reality of racism to other white people  who have never directly experienced it.
“The reason why the phrase ‘all lives matter’ is offensive to black people is because it isn’t true,” the blog post read. “Right now in America, my black children are treated differently than my white children, so when you say ‘all lives matter’ in response to the phrase ‘black lives matter,’ you are completely dismissing the mere daily experience of racism for those with pigment in their skin.”
Following the performance, the audience was able to speak directly with some of the actors about race in America. Audience members were given the opportunity to ask the two black male actors about their experiences as black men in America.
“I am a mom of two young black males,” one woman asked. “How do you feel going to school, going to work everyday being black? How does it truly make you feel?”
In response, Taylor Rivers, a junior majoring in theatre, reflected on how he constantly feels judged by authority figures at school
“For me, growing up was a challenge,” the actor said. “You can look at life half-empty or half-full, and I found it to be a good challenge for everyone above me to say, ‘This man can’t do anything’ and always proving them wrong.”
Audience members were then invited to be courageous and share their own experiences and thoughts on race, whatever they may be, with the room.
“I’m sitting here feeling really emotional and really helpless,” one woman said of the racial landscape in the U.S. “I think that’s because I’m white and I’ve had my own relationships with different people of color and I don’t know how to help. I feel really extremely sad and helpless so I could use some advice.”
Kim Montgomery, who attended the show, advised the audience to practice love.
“I really think that’s the thing that we all need to remember whenever we meet someone new, whenever we meet someone different, whenever we meet someone who we may not understand or identify with,” Montgomery said. “We can all relate to love.”
Despite being complete strangers, audience members greeted one another with a smile and were engaging in conversation with their neighbors  by the end of the performance — a testament to the power of storytelling and open discourse amid current racial tensions in the United States.

Emily Rudnick is a senior working on her BFA at the Roski School of Art and Design. Her newest exhibit, “Glory Days,” focuses on the deception of memory and is the newest addition to Roski’s Helen Lindhurst Gallery. The exhibit is one of many shows that will be held in the gallery this semester.
Daily Trojan: What is the focus of your art?  Do you have a specific theme?
Emily Rudnick: My work has developed a lot in terms of conceptual theme. This show is centered around … how selective memory and nostalgia can cause us to misremember our past and how that affects how we view the present. This work came from a time when I was obsessively attached to the past, and I wouldn’t let go of a [previous] relationship. I was always wishing that I could go back, and I made this work as a means to put that relationship to rest. Selective memory can cause us to romanticize the past, and [we can] forget the bigger picture … It keeps us from growing in the present.
DT: How would you describe your current work?
ER: I would describe my work as reflective. I got into this flat, two-dimensional graphic painting because I have a high respect for artists who can paint like a kid would paint but it still looks refined … and for a while I felt like painting had to be all representational, and I’m one of the only people in the painting emphasis that doesn’t do representational work.
DT: Can you explain the process behind this exhibit and “Glory Days”?
ER: [The fabric centerpiece] was the main motivation to apply for the show before I made any of the paintings … All the photos are either photos of me or photos I took of various specific times in my life that this show is reflective upon. I pulled all these photos — it’s not like photography, a lot of [the photos] are just taken with an iPhone …  a lot has changed since then.
I was working on the embroidery before I even knew what I was going to do with it. Something was just dragging me to do it … and I didn’t know what it was. And when I got this show, it was perfect because I knew what it was going to be.
DT: What do you want visitors to see when they walk in here?
ER: [“Glory Days”] is hyperpersonal. But I’m hoping that thematically, when people look at the symbols and the text, they can immediately think of a moment in their own past, and they can take away what they may have not even been looking to take away from art or from experience … I want people to be able to interpret this in a way that is personal to them.

Artist and designer Bonita Nongluk, a fifth-year senior majoring in business administration and art with emphasis in sculpture and design, brings her artwork to the Helen Lindhurst Gallery this February in her exhibit “Culinary Contact Zone,” featuring brightly-colored advertisements, giant chicken satays, video and edible arrangements for visitors.
DT: When did you first start creating art?
Bonita Nongluk: I started at USC as an English major. I always had a huge fascination with words, the power of language, especially because English is my second language. And I guess some of that is a big part of the show. And then I went to business. I sort of had that mid-life crisis where I realized that I had to make money, and then I was like, “Maybe I can still do what I love and make it acceptable in this late-stage capitalist world.” So I did design. I’d been designing since I was 15. I’m still doing that professionally just to pay the bills, but I took sculpture my sophomore year, and I haven’t looked back since. There’s nothing else I could do with my life.
DT: Do you enjoy designing?
BN: No, I don’t. And here’s the thing: I reprioritized the most important things in my life, and I realized that the most important thing in my life is to make art. The big difference between design and art is that design will solve the problem, but art will ask the questions. And I’m a curious fucking person. I just don’t think that I want to make other people money anymore … I’ll put in my time to go to graduate school and get my MFA and make art full time and be a professor and hopefully advocate for other artists who are women of color, who are quite disadvantaged within that institutional context. But that’s a few years down the line.
DT: How would you describe your style?
BN: Right now I’m focusing on absurd, crazy pop art. It goes along with the idea of over-layering communication, always doing too much. It’s a little extravagant, but I can do it.
DT: What message do you want your art to impress upon viewers?
BN: You cannot talk about pop art without talking about the rampant consumer culture. I am a social artist. I am an installation artist. I want whatever I do to interact with the space it’s in, with the context which it’s in. I want you to be in the space, completely.
Rudnick’s and Nongluk’s works are on view to the public through Feb. 14 at Watt Hall.

Getting an undergraduate nursing degree is a great option for many young people. Unless that young person also wants to be a Trojan, of course. USC should offer a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, a previously offered program, because it is a desirable, necessary trade for the U.S. economy. 
There is currently a shortage of nurses in the U.S., making nursing an incredibly appealing career since employment is almost guaranteed. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, being a nurse is a great gig: A nurse’s median annual pay in 2017 was $70,000, and the typical entry-level education required is a bachelor’s degree. What’s more,  employment between 2016 and 2026 is expected to increase by 15 percent — a rate faster than that of the average occupation. The Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University also found the U.S. economy will create 1.6 times as many jobs for nurses through 2020. 
While there is no nursing program for undergraduates, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences does offer advising for those who intend to pursue nursing. It acknowledges that the common path to a nursing career is a bachelor’s degree in nursing, but puts in bold that those without a BSN can pursue either  an accelerated bachelor of science in nursing or entry-level nursing master’s degree programs. They then list the courses they recommend pre-nursing students take in accordance with common nursing school prerequisites.
 While this information is helpful, it would be much more efficient for students to earn a BSN rather than go through four years of undergraduate studies and an additional year or two of schooling to become an actual nurse. USC is doing aspiring nurses a disservice by burdening them with extra time and money required for their career path of choice. 
USC began phasing out the bachelor of science in nursing in 2001. The University instead now offers a program called Nursing@USC, an online master’s degree program designed for registered nurses to become  family nurse practitioners. Students participate in live classes, work on self-paced coursework designed by USC faculty and are placed in clinical experiences within their community. 
There is also the option to come to USC’s campus to do one-on-one intensive training. Interestingly, the program is housed under the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, lending the curriculum access to the Dworak-Peck’s resources. This program is commendable, but it would be much more beneficial to offer students an undergraduate degree in nursing rather than a program to advance one’s existing nursing degree. 
Many BSN alumni who attribute their career success to USC are baffled by the University’s decision to cut the program. 
“Nursing is a great career for anyone, especially a young woman who is not sure what to do with her life,” Carmen Montalvan, a USC nursing alumna, told the Daily Trojan. “Though I chose to be a full-time mom, I am now going back to the career that gave me stability and fulfillment before having children. When I went back to USC to receive my transcripts in order to enter an accelerated nursing program [to renew my license], I was surprised to find out that USC got rid of its undergraduate program. I think it’s a mistake.” 
USC released a statement in 2001 defending its decision. 
“The annual graduating class of USC’s undergraduate program currently represents less than 100 students or less than 2 percent of California’s 5,000 annual nursing graduates,” the statement said. 
It’s a shame that USC viewed its impact from the persepctive of the nursing shortage rather than the prosperity of its graduates. Nursing is hard work, but it is a valuable career. In a time when unspecialized college degrees are becoming more and more obsolete, it’s important for universities to offer trade-like academic training that still demands critical thinking skills like any other field of study would.
At the time of the decision to phase out the program, USC’s statement referred to the decision of other major research universities, such as Stanford University, to remove the undergraduate nursing degree. But plenty of prestigious universities still offer nursing degrees to undergraduates, including Duke University, University of Pennsylvania, UCLA and N.Y.U. 
That’s a list of schools that USC could comfortably sit with. These schools see the value in a nursing degree — USC should too.
