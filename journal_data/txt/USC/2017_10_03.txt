As a student organization focused on debate and discussion, USC’s Model United Nations of Southern California annually hosts and plans TrojanMUN, a competitive conference that brings together universities to engage in simulated political delegation and strategies. This year’s event, which takes place in downtown Los Angeles, will be the largest yet, bringing approximately 330 to 350 delegates from California universities like UCLA and UC Berkeley. This will also be the first year East Coast schools like West Point Academy will attend.
“It is one of the only West Coast conferences in the fall, and aside from it being ranked the best [West Coast conference], it is one of the only very competitive ones,” said Sarahi Juarez, MUNSC’s director of external relations. “This is the first conference that brings in intense competition, especially because the UCs who come to our conference have just started school.” 
Since its conception four years ago, Juarez said the conference has grown through the efforts of MUNSC and the connections the team has built locally and at East Coast tournaments. The MUNSC team members travels to local and national conferences to improve their critical thinking, writing, networking and diplomacy skills, debating issues on the international community. The unique committees and staff have shaped TrojanMUN’s success, earning it recognition as the Best Fall Conference on the West Coast, Juarez said.
“It’s pretty amazing that [the TrojanMUN conference] worked that first year,” said Director of Internal Relations Alexander Melnik, who is also a four-year member of MUNSC. “It was the personal efforts of a small group of people, but those people were very hardworking and [made] an initial large investment.” 
Melnik explained that planning a conference is more than simply inviting schools to attend; it includes creating an agenda and preparing the logistics, such as securing a venue, paying fees and getting insurance for the event.
“Because [our team was] willing to take on that responsibility, we got the conference to work and had schools like Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Washington University [in St. Louis],” Melnik said. 
While the nonprofit organization holds weekly TrojanMUN meetings dedicated to continuing its summer work of preparations, edits, writings and detailed simulations, its main meetings are the three-hour sessions on Fridays. Here, the organization focuses on training members to travel as delegates to conferences. 
“We have new members, so we’re training them as delegates, and as staff for conferences in the future; once we’re getting closer to a conference and have their positions, we will dedicate a lot of time specifically to developing skills needed for that conference,” said Zoie Petrakis, the former MUNSC Secretary General. “We do our own simulations [as well]; that is a good way for us to practice as delegates but also for potential committees that we might run.”
Members are also preparing to head to the East Coast for conferences at the University of Pennsylvania and Georgetown University in the coming months. The group will send an unprecedented total of 12 members — six in October and six in November — to these conferences.
Due to increased interest in the organization, the application has become more competitive, with a one in five acceptance rate. However, this growth has also allowed for more opportunities for members, like workshops to help students learn the logistics of running a sustainable, long-term nonprofit. 
According to Petrakis, professors from the International Relations Department will speak to MUNSC students thanks to a new partnership.
The MUNSC leadership credits the growth of the organization mainly to its dedicated members who care about building the group. In addition to growth in membership and competitiveness, MUNSC also diversified its committees by recently adding ad hoc.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted to change the Latina/o Student Assembly to Latinx Student Assembly in a unanimous vote on Tuesday night. LSA Executive Director Karen García and co-assistant directors Catherine Bedoya and Cindy Cox attended the meeting to witness the vote.
The term “Latinx” has become more popular in recent discourse due to its gender neutrality. The Spanish language traditionally splits nouns into feminine and masculine categories, ending in either “a” for feminine words and “o” for masculine words.
García said it is an important step to eradicate this binary, as people who do not identify as male or female felt that the name “Latina/o Student Organization” did not represent them.
“In the name change, we’re providing a space for gender-nonconforming folks,” García said. “That’s something that wasn’t provided before as LSA.”
García, Bedoya and Cox were pleased that the name change was finalized, as they have been attempting to change the organization’s name since last year. Cox said that this move is a step in the right direction for LSA. 
“I think in the previous years, LSA has been very passive about a lot of issues that affect our community,” Cox said. “I think we have really tried to step forward and advocate more for our community, whether it takes place in a protest or something else.”
Bedoya explained how the vote failed before making it to USG last year. 
“We actually tried to pass this a year ago, but it was denied through our organization because it needs to be voted on before we bring it to USG for a final vote,” Bedoya said. 
García said the process of approving the organization’s name change was challenging due to some members’ concerns about the connotations of the term “Latinx.”
“There were a lot of concerns of it being too political and that it would change the language,” García said. 
Someday these kids will look back at their “LatinX” fad with a combination of embarrassment and regret.
What a bunch of cowards.

The Von KleinSmid Center Library will host a mapathon to help the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team put Hurricane Maria  victims on maps for responders like the American Red Cross to use to deliver relief. The four-hour event is open to all members of the USC community, and will take place on 11 a.m. on Thursday.
Hurricane Maria’s destructive force has ruined the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, devastating thousands of homes, buildings and roads. 
Andy Rutkowsi, the visualization librarian at VKC Library, worked to organize the event at USC after hearing about a mapathon that took place on Friday at Columbia University. 
“[The Red Cross] needs infrastructure data, and they’re using this platform called OpenStreetMap, which is an open data-mapping platform,” Rutkowski said. “[The Humanitarian Open Street Map Team] asked people to volunteer and contribute to this map project, to go in and look at satellite imagery and draw out buildings where they were before the hurricane.” 
Relief organizations usually rely on OpenStreetMap, a free, global collaborative and editable map project, to better assess how to provide recovery, deliver goods and locate victims of disasters.
“Unlike the U.S., a lot of other areas are not fully mapped as well, so having that data is really important,” Rutkowski said.
The event invites volunteers to bring their own laptops, and event coordinators will instruct them how to navigate the platform to add information and draw buildings. The project is largely collaborative, requiring a confirmation process between multiple volunteers before the information is sent to the American Red Cross, Rutkowski said. 
“What happens in maps in different countries is there isn’t an actual building outline,” Rutkowski said. “If I’m getting a bunch of food and I need to distribute this food, what building is actually there? That kind of data for Puerto Rico and lots of other places isn’t found, so that’s what we’re mapping.” 
Rutkowski said this data is critical during a natural disaster like Hurricane Maria. However, he also wants to partner with local organizations to work on mapathons for areas not currently affected for the future. 
Columbia University and several other East Coast universities also concentrated efforts to help, alongside thousands of independent computer users in the U.S., according to PBS. 
“This is a very coordinated effort,” Rutkowski said. “These other libraries on the East Coast — we know these folks — and we’re now joining the team and doing our best as well [on the West Coast].” 
I currently live in San Juan, PR and recently stopped by the Red Cross operations center here in San Juan to see for myself how they are employing OSM. This data is quite valuable for the relief missions these and other organizations are currently conducting, especially in rural areas where not much data on the structures exist. A very big thank you to all of those participating in this effort.
@josemoliver:disqus Thank you so much for sharing that! I am letting other Map-a-thon folks know about your experience. Thanks again Daily Trojan for sharing this story and thank you everyone who came out and gave support. We had a wonderful turn out.

Avoid foods you KNOW are bad for you. If the food seems unclean and bad for you, you’re probably right. Specifically, try to refrain from junk food, processed foods, fast food, and edibles that are high in carbs, fat, oil, or sugar. If you are hungry and looking for a quick meal, opt for healthy fruits and vegetables over tortilla chips. 
 
Drink water. Water helps to remove by-products of fat and reduce how much you eat by filling up your stomach. Often times, you may think you feel hungry when in reality you are just thirsty. Water is a natural appetite suppressant that can help to raise your metabolism and, best of all, is zero calories. 
 
Don’t drink your calories. Sugary drinks and alcohol have more calories than you think! One shot of vodka has about 100 calories, and a smoothie from Jamba Juice can have between 200 and 500 calories. Coffee and tea are good options if you drink them without add ons. 
 
Buy smaller dishware. Eating off of smaller dishware has been shown to reduce your overall food intake. People will usually fill their plate and won’t stop eating until it is clean, even if they aren’t hungry anymore. Studies by Cambridge University show that smaller plates allow you to eat ten percent less.
 
Burn your calories on the go. Opt to walk to places if they are within close proximity or to take the stairs rather than the elevator. Next time you want to go grocery shopping, choose to walk instead of getting a ride. It’s good for you and reduces your carbon footprint! Walking from place to place can help burn hundreds of calories a day, keeping you more fit and raising your metabolism. 
 
Go to the gym. USC provides us with free gym memberships for a reason! Working out improves your muscle definition, keeping you toned and raising your metabolism. Exercise improves the levels of “good” HDL cholesterol you have in your body and reduces “bad” LDL cholesterol concentration. This lowers your blood pressure and risk for heart disease while increasing your energy and overall mood. 
 
Cook meals. By cooking your meals at home, you know exactly what you are putting in your stomach and have more control of the calorie count. Next time you are deciding between cooking and going out to eat or ordering delivery, remember that you’ll likely eat a smaller, healthier amount (and save money) by cooking. 
 
Eat more earlier in the day. In a 2013 study called “Obesity”, researchers discovered that those who ate a big breakfast, medium lunch, and light dinner lost more weight than those who ate a light breakfast, medium lunch, and big dinner, even though the two groups consumed virtually the same amount of calories. Moreover, studies have shown that food consumed later at night is more likely to be stored as fat than to burn as energy. 
 
Consider crash diets. Though these may carry a negative stigma, they do work while not having to be harmful. One crash diet to consider is the grapefruit diet, which concerns a restricted food intake mainly consisting of grapefruit. Not considering a limited eating regimen, eating half of a grapefruit with every meal can still help you burn more calories than if you did not. Another healthy diet is the Atkins diet, which focuses on lowering carb intake. Of course, use crash diets in moderation as they can have short term benefits but, in the long run, deplete you of nutrients.
 
Let yourself have cheat days. A large meal every now and then is okay and can even be beneficial. Your body can hold onto extra calories because of stress, and eating one larger meal in the midst of a low-calorie diet can help your body relax and expend the excess. One cheat meal also won’t change your body as it is elastic – just wait a day and any bloating will have completely disappeared.

Welcome to Sex and the Campus, a weekly column where I discuss all things love and relationships. It should be noted that I do not claim to be any kind of expert in either area. Dating is hard, but hopefully reading this column won’t be. 
If you have any burning questions about love and relationships, or just have a good dating horror story to share feel free to send them to dailytrojanblogs@gmail.com 
This week we’re talking about sex. Since it is a sex column, I figured it was fitting. 
What is it about that word that makes people blush and cringe? We all know it happens, but for some reason no one wants to talk about it. Sex-ed in schools in a joke and if you’re not lucky enough to have parents who will talk to you about doing the horizontal mambo, you’re normally getting your information from friends, TV, or porn; none of those sources are accurate by the way. 
If you have sex, you’re a slut, and if you don’t, you’re a prude. No one can win with those odds. Here’s the truth about sex: It is a big deal, and you don’t have to religious or prudish to believe that. It’s not the only form of intimacy, but it’s pretty high up there on the list.
Sex is supposed to be romantic, awkward, and sometimes even a little humorous. It’s definitely not like the movies, but maybe it should be. In films, it’s this beautiful moment of passion between two people who have been fighting to be together. In real life, sex is just chalked up to dating apps and late night booty call texts. I think I like fantasy better than reality.
The problem with real life is that we try to convince ourselves that sex and love are mutually exclusive. When we know in our heart of hearts that they are inexplicably linked. There’s no such thing as “casual sex”. There’s truthfully nothing casual about it. No matter your sex, gender, and sexual orientation there are always emotions involved.
Now, I’m not judging anyone who’s bought into this hook up culture phenomenon; I haven’t always been so mushy about intercourse myself.  I got hurt once, and it hardened my heart. My romantic notions about waiting for my one true love were forgotten. My soul calloused over to protect myself from the pain someone had inflicted on me. If sex and being intimate with someone meant so much, then that person had taken something from me. So it couldn’t mean anything.
In that hurt, I made a stupid choice. I convinced myself that I didn’t care, that the lack of candles and rose petals didn’t matter. I felt like that’s all I was worth. Then something happened, well someone. I met this guy who somehow was able to crack my tough exterior. He made me feel safe in being vulnerable. He didn’t want anything, and gave me everything. 
We shouldn’t be afraid to talk about sex. We need to be talking about it. We need to be encouraging each other to wait. Don’t settle for the cheap thrills because what Cosmo doesn’t tell you is that not all sex is great sex. There aren’t 50 tips to having good sex, there’s only one: Wait for love. One day there will be someone who makes you feel like there have been a thousand butterflies set off in your stomach. They will make you feel safe, and respected. They won’t sneak off in the middle of the night, or ghost you the next day. You’re worth that.

The women’s volleyball team welcomed No. 6 Washington to the Galen Center on Sunday, as USC geared up for a stiff challenge from the reigning Pac-12 champions. Though the two teams battled closely throughout the match, the Women of Troy pulled off an upset in style, sweeping the Huskies in three sets with scores of 25-20, 25-21 and 28-26.
A Trojan upset didn’t seem imminent, however, when Washington found itself up 19-16 late in the first set. But USC turned the tables with a 9-1 run to shock the Huskies with an opening-set victory. Senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie, senior opposite hitter Niki Withers and sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier combined for six kills in the final 7 points to swing the momentum in their favor to begin the match.
The Women of Troy rode similar bursts to a win in the second set. Three unanswered points broke a 5-5 tie, and another 3-0 run gave USC the edge when Washington tied the set at eight apiece. The Trojans didn’t relinquish their advantage from that point, and they took the second set 25-21.
The final set was a much tighter affair, as the Huskies tied the score seven times after USC edged in front. But the Women of Troy refused to fall behind, even as the set extended past 25 points. They came up short in 3 match points, but senior middle blocker Jordan Dunn came up with a kill to set up a fourth. Finally, an ace from Withers sealed a 28-26 third-set win and sent the Huskies home. With the victory, USC rose to No. 15 in the AVCA Coaches poll while Washington slipped to No. 9.
The Women of Troy were unable to take a single set against Washington when the two teams met last season, but they returned the favor in 2017 thanks to a balanced attack. Abercrombie recorded 13 kills, Withers put down 12 kills and Lanier added 11 more. Abercrombie’s strong day, combined with her 13-kill match against Washington State on Saturday, earned her Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week honors for the second consecutive week. Overall, the Women of Troy recorded a .214 hitting percentage while holding the Huskies to .131, spurring the team on to its first straight-sets victory over Washington since 2011.
The balanced offensive effort also came with equally strong defense.  Leading the back row was junior libero Victoria Garrick, who had 13 digs alongside her eight assists.  Lanier and Meyer-Whalley also added 12 digs each. Though the Huskies out-blocked USC 11-5 on the day, the Women of Troy also had eight more digs as a team, recording 58 to Washington’s 50.
Meyer-Whalley earned her fifth consecutive double-double this match, raising her career tally to 14, while Lanier’s 11 kills and 12 digs sealed the sophomore’s 20th double-double in Cardinal and Gold.
The Trojans continue Pac-12 play on the road next weekend, facing Arizona State and Arizona. They will face the Wildcats first on Friday night before traveling to Tempe for ASU on Saturday.

Mohammad Alsubaie | Daily Trojan
The No. 7 women’s soccer team (8-1-1) managed a comeback at home this past Sunday, beating Oregon 2-1.
The game started very evenly, with the flow going back and forth as each team saw scoring opportunities. The flow suddenly ended in the 13th minute, however, when a poor clearance from redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins and subsequent defensive miscues by the Trojans backline resulted in an Oregon goal. Amid the disarray, freshman midfielder Chardonnay Curran scored into an empty net.
After the Ducks’ goal, the Women of Troy established control of the game, applying more pressure on the Oregon backline, to no avail.  After this period of Trojan pressure, the game resumed as before, with neither team managing to gain the upper hand.  USC’s best chance came in the 44th minute, when a shot from sophomore forward Taylor McMorrow stung the hands of Oregon goalkeeper Halla Hinriksdottir.  The shot bounced off Hinriksdottir’s gloves, with the ball waiting for a tap-in to equal the score, but no Trojan was able to get a foot on it.  An evenly played half ended 1-0, with Oregon mustering five shots while the Trojans only managed four.
The second half started as the first did: Oregon was the first to see goal-scoring chances, with shots in the 51st and 53rd minutes going wide and being blocked, respectively.  Then the Trojans had a pair of opportunities with a 57th-minute shot by junior defender Ally Prisock that was saved by Hinriksdottir and a 58th-minute header from senior midfielder Nicole Molen that went wide of the post.
There was a reduction in action until the 71st minute, when Hinriksdottir turned away a shot from McMorrow.  But Hinriksdottir collided with another player while blocking the subsequent rebound and had to be substituted.  Southern California native and sophomore goalkeeper Katelyn Carter was put in the Ducks’ net for the remainder of the game.
The Trojans seemed to find their rhythm with fresh blood between the posts, recording three shots in the 76th and 77th minutes. Two were saved by Carter, and the third hit the crossbar after a flurry of activity inside the Oregon penalty area.
The Trojans finally found a breakthrough in the 82nd minute: An excellent deep cross from the left side near the halfway line from junior forward Erika Okuma found the head of senior midfielder Nicole Molen, who placed it beautifully into the bottom right corner of the goal to tie the game.
It only got better for the Trojans from there. In the 84th minute — resulting from a corner kick and a weak clearance from Oregon defenders — Okuma’s long-range shot from outside the penalty box was redirected into the net by freshman forward Tara McKeown, beating Carter to her right.
The goal gave the Trojans a one-goal edge, and they survived one last onslaught from the Oregon offense to maintain the scoreline and collect another win in league play.
However, despite the victory, head coach Keidane McAlpine admitted the Trojans were second-best on the day and were fortunate to get a victory on Sunday.
“Oregon was a little bit better than us for the majority of the game,” McAlpine said. “But the competitive spirit that we have shown all season found its way into this one. We were able to get two late goals, and all the credit goes to our team for being able to get that done.”
Next for the Women of Troy is a Thursday night matchup away against Arizona as USC looks to maintain its undefeated record in the Pac-12.

After being arrested by the FBI on charges that included conspiracy to commit bribery and wire fraud, USC assistant basketball coach Tony Bland has enlisted the services of attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Lichtman also represents alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzmán, also known as “El Chapo.”
Lichtman will be tasked with defending Bland following allegations that the USC assistant coach accepted bribes from sports agent Christian Dawkins and financial advisers, in return for convincing his players to sign with Dawkins’ budding agency. The FBI said that Bland accepted a cash gift of $13,000 from Dawkins. If found guilty of the charges, the U.S. Justice Department said Bland could face a maximum sentence of 80 years in prison.
Bland was arrested last week in Tampa, Fla., and was promptly released on $100,000 bail. He was named in the FBI’s investigation alongside three other NCAA assistant coaches: Emmanuel Richardson from Arizona, Chuck Person from Auburn and Lamont Evans from Oklahoma State. Louisville head coach Rick Pitino has already been effectively fired after the  university was also named in the report.
USC athletic director Lynn Swann placed Bland on administrative leave almost immediately after the FBI report surfaced. The University also hired Louis Freeh, a former FBI director, to conduct an internal investigation into the basketball program’s practices.
In addition to “El Chapo,” Lichtman also represented John Gotti Jr., the notorious head of the Gambino crime family in New York. He was successful in that endeavor, as Gotti had three murder charges dismissed in 2005.
“This whole thing has been absolutely devastating to his family,” Lichtman said to the Los Angeles Times. “At this time, we’re focused on his defense and his family. That’s more than he can handle.”
Lichtman also added that Bland had a message for USC.
“The guy absolutely loves USC and appreciates everything they’ve done for him every step of the way in his career, even through now,” Lichtman said. “He wants the USC family to know how much he’s appreciated his time there.”
Lichtman’s comments on Monday were the first statements made from Bland or his representatives since his arrest last week.
The attorney has represented Guzmán since this August.

A Sunday afternoon at the StubHub Center in Carson, Calif., is quite the experience. Upon entering the stadium, you can confirm that a 27,000-seat venue for professional football winds up being unique as one of the most intimate spectacles in sports. The cheapest seats here give fans fantastic proximity and a clear vantage point of the action on the field.
Despite the novelty of StubHub, the Los Angeles Chargers’ current home, a stubborn issue within the confines of the stadium re-surfaced this past Sunday, when the team hosted the Philadelphia Eagles. An evil that has stared the Chargers in the face for weeks was now on full display against the Eagles.
In Los Angeles’ 26-24 loss to Philadelphia, the StubHub Center transformed from the home of the Chargers to the home of the Eagles.
Taking a quick glance over the reported 25,374 fans in attendance on Sunday, it appeared as if green-clad Eagles jerseys made up the majority of spectators on hand. Since the conclusion of the game, videos have circulated throughout social media documenting the Chargers’ lost home-field advantage. “Let’s Go, Eagles” chants and the classic Eagles’ fight song, “Fly Eagles Fly,” dominated the sound waves at the stadium on Sunday. On several of the Chargers’ offensive drives, the stadium rocked with chants of “Defense! Defense!”
The Eagles’ takeover of StubHub was so noticeable that players from both teams commented on it postgame.
“I mean, it’s almost like the Chargers got 16 away games,” Eagles veteran tackle Jason Peters told reporters. “It’s going to be tough sledding for those guys.’’
The Chargers’ house doesn’t feel much like the Chargers’ home at the moment.
The Chargers’ close loss to Philadelphia capped off a three-game home stand for the team in Carson. Los Angeles lost all three home contests, and the team still finds itself winless through four weeks of regular season play.
“Never in a million years did I think we’d be here at 0-4, but we are,” Chargers first-year head coach Anthony Lynn said following Sunday’s game.
Lynn isn’t alone in his disbelief. The Chargers’ locker room was a place of despair, frustration and confusion following a fourth consecutive defeat. Losing tightly contested games has been a cruel reality for the team in its short time back playing in Los Angeles. Three of the Chargers’ four losses this season have come by three points or less; two of the losses came by failing to convert on a late-game field goal attempt.
It’s getting harder to remember this, but the Chargers’ main slogan entering 2017 was “Battle for L.A.” It would be safe to assume that, at this point, the Los Angeles Rams have a stranglehold on their contest with the Chargers for football relevancy in Los Angeles.
The Rams are coming off an impressive 35-30 win over the reigning NFC East champion Dallas Cowboys on the road. Behind 31-year-old head coach Sean McVay, the 3-1 Rams appear to have a newfound spark that has the Angeleno contingency talking. (Let me be the first to remind you, though, that Jeff Fisher had the Rams at 3-1 last season before a monumental collapse).
Nonetheless, the Rams are currently curb-stomping their counterpart in the battle for L.A. sports supremacy. It’s hard to argue when you look at it from a distance.
A young, budding Jared Goff along with an electric Todd Gurley is much more marketable to folks than is an ageing Phillip Rivers and underused Melvin Gordon. And on the defensive side, the Rams boast arguably the most dominant defensive player in football in Aaron Donald.
The Chargers can certainly pick something up from the Rams: Winning can lift a franchise out of even the lowliest of circumstances. If the Chargers can string together several victories — or at least one — at home this season, you’d think that would better alleviate a painful scenario like the team had this past Sunday at StubHub. You can’t have a home-field advantage without giving the occupants of your home field a reason to support you.
For the Chargers, disinterest has been the illness thus far. Winning is the only true cure.

I’ve experienced more in the last two weeks than I have the entire year. With as much as I have going on right now — school, a full-time job, plus three freelance writing positions — it’s been excruciatingly difficult to find inspiration. I feel like I’m constantly moving on to the next thing before I can even start to feel settled in the present. But I also feel as if inspiration is waiting in the most unlikely of places. I just need to tap into a place where creativity can flow through my body like water. And lately, that place has been the opera house.
I recently began a new position at the LA Opera in its public relations department. Though I’ve only been employed for a little over a week, I’d say my favorite part of the job thus far has been exploring the halls and corridors of Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. True, many of these behind-the-scenes spaces are just offices and practice rooms, yet there is still something magical about them. I’m no stranger to the opera house (or opera in general), but experiencing these unknown areas has made me realize that there are still things to learn about this industry and art form. It’s in these areas where the performances begin to bloom, and it’s also where I feel the most comfortable.
Not many people realize how much work it takes to put on a full-scale production, especially through a professional company. What is seen onstage during the performance is probably about 10 percent of the total result. Most of the planning and execution happens off the stage, in said office spaces and rehearsal rooms. Rarely does anything in the opera house happen by chance — seasons are always planned years in advance.
As you read this sentence, contracts are already being drawn up for the productions set to premiere five to six years from now. It makes sense, to a degree — why would a professional company leave its planning to the last minute? It is much more beneficial to overcompensate than to leave everyone scrambling at the eleventh hour. I admire this attention to detail because it means opera companies are really investing all their efforts to make sure even the most minute details receive equal attention.
But then again, how beneficial is it to plan this far in advance? Sh-t always comes up that we can’t predict. For instance, the Metropolitan Opera opened its 2017-18 season last week with David McVicar’s new production of Bellini’s Norma, with soprano Sondra Radvanovsky in the title role. Radvanovsky is a reputable singer and also a favorite at the Met, and ended up garnering favorable reviews for her interpretation of the Druid priestess.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
However, Radvanovsky wasn’t originally cast in the role. In fact, the entire production was created around another singer, Russian soprano superstar Anna Netrebko. Plans for the new production had been set in stone for a few years, and the ink on the contracts had been dry for some time. But last year, the Met dropped a bombshell that Netrebko had pulled out of the production, as well as all further productions of Norma across the globe.
Netrebko stated the reason for her cancellation was that her voice had “evolved in a different direction,” and that she had not anticipated this growth at the time that she had agreed to the role. Though it was later revealed that Netrebko actually pulled out because she hated the role (which is a story for a different time), it is not at all uncommon for a singer’s voice to drastically change within only a few years. Speaking from a vocal pedagogical standpoint, it is absurd to think that one’s voice will be in the same place in five years. With this in mind, what’s the point of the contracts then? It’s going to be a gamble no matter what.
I can’t help but relate this principle to aspects in my own life, such as graduate school or even the job I just got. I can’t predict how I’ll change or feel in the next five years, let alone the next year in general. Why am I expected to map the rest of my life in my early 20s when I can’t even stick to a daily routine? By changing things up, even on a day-to-day basis, I feel like I’m cheating adulthood by delaying the process as long as possible. Maybe that’s why it’s taken me so damn long to finish my bachelor’s degree — I’m deliberately trying to shake things up.
Even though it’s been hard to find inspiration, I find it even harder to stay positive. With Sunday’s tragedy in Las Vegas and yesterday’s campus scare, feeling off-balance has started to become the norm. Every time I feel like things are on the mend, or they will finally get better or improve, something happens that completely unravels my optimism. My silver lining, however, is the opera house. In a world where everything and everyone is expected to adhere to an agenda, opera is my primary source of spontaneity.

More than 15,000 scantily clad attendees lined up underneath the sweeping pink balloon arch on South Olive Street on Sunday. At 11 a.m., they began to strut through Pershing Square and wave in the air their vibrant posters, targeting issues such as slut- or fat-shaming, bigotry and racism. Leading the march was socialite and activist Amber Rose, who came dressed as her superhero alter-ego “Captain Save A Hoe,” on a mission to keep the streets free from sexism and slut-shaming.
On Saturday and Sunday, the Amber Rose Weekend in downtown Los Angeles united male and female feminists alike to raise awareness about social justice issues. The weekend consisted of the inaugural OPENed: The Women’s Conference on Friday, with the third annual Amber Rose SlutWalk taking place the following day.
The OPENed conference was commissioned by the Amber Rose Foundation and USC Dornsife Center for Feminist Research to create a space where “unedited conversation meets education, compassion and a sheer desire to enact change.” Throughout the day, the conference, held in Ronald Tutor Campus Center, featured panelists, keynote speakers and various workshops that served to empower women.
The event started with a welcome address from Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro, chair of the gender studies program at USC, who has been active in various gender equity, black equity and women of color movements.
Rose then kicked off the rest of the conference, giving her own backstory and reasons behind bringing back SlutWalk and weaving an educational component into the weekend. For her, slut-shaming is more than projecting hurtful words to others — it’s ingrained in human culture.
“I am a mother now, but before, I used to call women ‘sluts’ and ‘hoes’ all the time because society taught me to think that way and talk that way,” Rose said.
Following Rose’s introduction to the conference, guests were split into workshops held at Fertitta Hall. For the rest of the morning, people attended three one-hour workshops, which covered five categories: Know Your Rights, Sex Talk and Relationships, Entrepreneurship and Financial Literacy, Activism and Policy. Each workshop was hosted by a different speaker, ranging from entertainment lawyers to social workers to songwriters.
One workshop in the activism category featured Napatia T. Gettings, an expert in the field of mental health and wellness from the University of Chicago. In her practice, Gettings has delved into advocacy, legislative policy, mental health awareness and education. According to her, fewer medical students have been specializing in psychiatry due to the stigma that comes with working with people with mental health issues.
“We need to create more conversation about mental health issues because they are not uncommon and people are still dealing with them,” Gettings said. “Psychiatry just has an awful history in the past too because some people don’t think we are trustworthy, and this only worsens the problem.”
With these new workshops adding an educational component to the Amber Rose Weekend, many attendees felt more empowered and motivated to speak up about social injustice.
Anaya Frazier, a high school sophomore from Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy in Chicago, enjoyed how each of the workshops shed light on certain topics that were overlooked or considered taboo. Back in Chicago, Frazier is a program associate for Project HealUs, which delves into reproductive justice awareness.
“Just to be here and experience people who are also involved with this kind of movement is really eye-opening, and I plan to take what I learned here and apply it to the conferences I will be organizing back at home,” Frazier said.
After the workshops, the rest of the conference took place in RTCC. During the luncheon, mistress of ceremony Audrey Bellis played several videos for the audience, including Subversal’s short film series “Free THOT,” singer Isabelle Pasqualone’s official music video for “Unlabeled” and a clip featuring Rose interviewing former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton about sexism in politics.

The conference then shifted gears to a panel discussion and fireside chat. With Alfaro and Bellis co-moderating, the panel featured Rose; Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion at USC Debra Langford; author and leading sex expert Christopher Donaghue; assemblywoman Autumn Burke; YouTuber and activist of the #GirlLove campaign Lilly Singh; and Los Angeles County Board of Education President Alex Johnson.
After the panel, Alfaro and Rose presented several “Disruptive and Proud” Awards to some of the panelists, workshop hosts and others who have been heavily involved in the leadership and activism in the movement to empower women.
At the end of the conference, Rose thanked the coordinators for its overall success and detailed the schedule for the SlutWalk the next day. She also encouraged her guests to take what they learned and to bring more awareness in their own communities to social issues.
“Just remember this: You don’t owe anybody anything,” Rose said. “You can say no at any point. And I refuse to just let one man dictate how I decide to live the rest of my life.”
The following day, thousands of people flooded Pershing Square for the third annual SlutWalk. After a kick-off party with performances by Jenzi, Margie Plus and Just Brittney, the march officially began, with crowds holding up signs and chanting “Rosebuds,” the official nickname for Rose’s fans.
The weekend proved empowering for attendees hailing from near and far. For Meghann Smith, a dancer from Portland, this was her second time marching in the SlutWalk. In her life, she said she has experienced several instances of sexism, racism and ignorance, and the Amber Rose Weekend was able to give her an outlet to express her opinions without judgment.
“I’ve been womanized, and I experienced a lot of wage gap where I worked while I tried to achieve my goals,” Smith said. “I just couldn’t accept that in my life every day. Here at the SlutWalk, I’m glad that other women here understood how I felt, and I want to be here to make my statement.”

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
On Monday at noon, reports of an active shooter on our campus ground daily university life to a jarring halt. While the Los Angeles Police Department and USC Department of Public Safety later found the reports to be false, the incident was particularly unnerving following a weekend of mass shootings across the United States.
Early Sunday morning, three people were shot and killed at a bar near the University of Kansas. And less than 24 hours later, a gunman opened fire on a crowd of thousands at a music festival from the window of a Las Vegas hotel. By Monday, at least 59 were dead and more than 500 were hospitalized in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in recent American history.
It is tempting to treat these tragedies with individualized attention and focus. But we cannot separate these events from the greater crisis that we, as Americans, are all a part of.
Every Friday, the Daily Trojan editorial board publishes a stance on an issue pertinent to the campus community. However, due to the critical nature of the events that have unfolded over the last 24 hours, it is evident that now is the time for meaningful discourse — it simply cannot wait. At USC, most undergraduates have witnessed the four deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history during their lifetimes. We have heard time and time again about the need for gun control, the need for institutional change and the need to better prepare for the next mass gun-driven casualty. But put simply, we cannot wait for the next tragedy to strike before taking action.
It is our classmates who fled from Fertitta Hall in the face of a not-so-unbelievable occurrence that has taken place on many college campuses. It is our futures that will develop in a world where our peers have become desensitized to the violence of mass shootings. It is our lives that hang in the balance — and it will continue to be our peers who perish at the hands of this political stalemate.
College students are consistently called upon to be the change we wish to see in the world. Since the culture wars of the 1960s, American college campuses have been hubs for activism, political leadership and revolution. But the daunting reality is that neither we as students nor our university administrators have the complete power to fix this greater national crisis. It is up to our state and federal lawmakers to recognize that gun control is not and has never been about scoring cheap political points or clinging to catchy rhetorical narratives about liberty. Rather, this is about our livelihoods as their constituents, and what is arguably the most powerful modern barrier to Americans’ right to safely pursue life, liberty and happiness.
That being said, students can and must take actionl. It is of paramount importance that they express their views and vocalize their demands, that they engage in peaceful protests and do all that they can to stay aware, informed and involved. Meaningful change in the national political sphere has always begun on college campuses, and it is our responsibility to continue this tradition.
In the same vein, USC must also take action as well. Last year’s overcrowded Springfest concert could too easily have been the site of a gun-related catastrophe similar to Sunday night’s shooting in Las Vegas.
Ultimately, the debate is about de-escalation, and how we can prevent tragic gun deaths of all kinds from occurring. Just two weeks before the Las Vegas shooting, Georgia Tech campus police shot and killed a suicidal, knife-wielding student, a death that could have been prevented with mental health training and the use of less deadly weapons. At the same time, DPS is currently deciding whether to provide tasers to officers who currently have only firearms as their sole tool to de-escalate violent situations. While it’s crucial that campus police be armed with the necessary tools to address potential armed attackers — like the false shooting report that took place on Monday — the Georgia Tech shooting signals that more guns are never the only answer.
Credible research has shown for years that firearms function exclusively in an offensive capacity, and often fail to adequately serve as defense mechanisms. Fifty-nine were slaughtered and hundreds injured before the Sunday evening Las Vegas gunman was stopped — and not by gun-wielding law enforcement officers than by his decision to shoot himself. In the wake of this tragedy, our dialogue cannot be one of helplessness and confusion, but of how we as a nation can move forward and enact meaningful change to ensure that this does not happen again. This is necessary not only on a national level, but also on college campuses — many of which have been sites for campus shootings and violent escalations — across the country.
Almost as tragic as these incidents themselves is the simple reality of how avoidable they would be if U.S. lawmakers listened to credible research and the agonized voices of their constituents rather than lobbyists like the National Rifle Association. It is staggering to consider the sheer number of lives that could have been saved by implementing common-sense restrictions, such as regulating on-site sales at gun shows, sales of semi-automatic weapons and keeping guns out of the hands of individuals with records of violence and criminal histories.
USC’s student body and administrators can and must do more than think and pray. Students must call their representatives, and on municipal, state and federal levels, vote for lawmakers who care about their well-being. Our nation’s future is on the line.
Daily Trojan Fall 2017 Editorial Board
We need to talk about guns, true, but let’s take a more scientific look….   studies from other countries show that use of certain prescription drugs cause homicidal and/or suicidal thoughts.   Nevada papers are reporting that Paddock was prescribed diazepam in June — about the time he started amassing guns.  We would be negligent if we didn’t look carefully at the interplay between psycho-active prescription drugs and episodes of violence in this country — whether the weapon was guns, knives, or other.
I can’t wait to challenge any legislation intended to dilute our 2nd Amendment right.  Think!  There is not a law on the books or a new piece of legislation that could prevent instances like the one that happened in Las Vegas.  However, acting against guns sounds good and feels good, so the puerile types march on.

President Donald Trump is hardly a master of rhetoric, though the one positive thing that can be said about the commander-in-chief’s tweeting habit is that he’s efficient. Really. Even without the new 280-character limit, Trump attaches adjectives to nouns like no one’s business. Very few people he tweets about escape without a description: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is “wonderful,” the news (or at least, the outlets who fairly scrutinize his actions as president) is “fake,” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz is “nasty” and those who criticize the lack of action plaguing her hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico are “politically motivated ingrates.”
By definition, an “ingrate” is an ungrateful person.” This is interesting, because both the spoken and unspoken rules surrounding who should be grateful and who shouldn’t be seem to have penetrated the public conscience of late, beginning — if one can believe it — with the campaign of Trump himself. It was a campaign centered on woe, the pain of the “forgotten” white working class. Compared to the recent targets of Trump’s ire —the Puerto Ricans who “want everything to be done for them,” the players who don’t properly respect “the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL” and those who are brave enough to call the president out — there remains evident a clear racial discrepancy in how Trump perceives the people whom he has been elected to govern.
It’s worth comparing to the backlash surrounding Vanderbilt resident physician Eugene Gu’s recent tweet about kneeling in protest, which Tanya Chen outlined in her recent BuzzFeed article titled “People Are Claiming This Asian-American Doctor Who Took a Knee Is Too Privileged To Speak Out.” Gu, a prominent medical doctor and political advocate whose stance is famously anti-Trump, posted a picture of himself on Twitter kneeling with a raised fist, allying himself with the legions of athletes and sports personnel kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality. However,  some of the  criticism that arose over Gu’s post was curiously not about his activist views but instead about his race, with people asserting that because Gu achieved success as an Asian American (a person of color), he has no right to complain about perceived social injustices toward anybody else.
This is faulty logic, on many sides, but the gravest is the idea that if something does not directly affect one’s own life, then one should have no reason to have an opinion about it. For Americans of color, this idea is further damaging because it separates minorities into splinters, alienating their causes from each other and perpetuating the dominance of the white patriarchy. When public minority figures use their platforms to promote liberal ideas that benefit people beyond themselves, it draws a kind of ire because these figures are reminding the world of the fact that they are people of color.
The idea that one need only stand for oneself, without having to account for the community or race or country one’s family came from, is a perception exclusive to those who’ve always been allowed to be seen as individuals. And that is privilege. Money, material items, professional status: these items add to privilege, but they do not define it. And in a political climate as tumultuous as this, it accomplishes absolutely nothing to rip apart marginalized peoples’ achievements when there is so much progress left to be made.
Journalist Mark Harris recently tweeted: “Nothing triggers Trump more than perceived ingratitude from successful POCs. In his mind, they don’t achieve things; they are given things.”
And this is true. The word grateful connotes a person looking up at someone else, their hands pressed together in a kind of silent deference. In the macrocosmic view of things, framed around the idea of gratitude, exists the disturbing idea that it is a white man’s world and everyone else is just living in it — that minorities can be grateful or ungrateful, but what they cannot be is independent, fierce and fearless. That what they are always doing is taking from the hand or spitting in the face, when in actuality they hold as much right as anyone else in this country to bring their thoughts into the world.

In the wake of a mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 59 and left hundreds injured on Sunday night, students across campus have expressed concern for friends and loved ones in Nevada, as well as fear for their own safety after false reports of a shooting rocked campus Monday.
Dozens of students, each carrying lighted candles, held back tears as they stood outside the Office of Religious Life for a candlelight vigil organized on Monday evening to honor the victims of Sunday’s deadly attack in Las Vegas.
Niv Shahmoon, a freshman majoring in accounting, attended the vigil with his high school friends from Las Vegas. Two of Shahmoon’s close friends and his sister’s childhood best friend were shot and injured during the attack.
“This is unifying,” Shahmoon said, referring to the vigil. “It’s showing me the home away from home, a sanctuary where we can all be together.”
Jim Burklo, the senior associate dean of religious life, began the ceremony with a statement of solidarity and comfort to the students. While we are not all directly connected to the attack in Las Vegas, he said, we all share an indirect connection through the Trojan Family.
Several students offered prayers out loud for the community. One student holding a rose connected the Vegas shooting with the campus lockdown earlier in the day. She asked the community to pray for the USC professor who “fell victim” to the horror and trauma of the Las Vegas attack.
Other students aimed to honor the victims in Las Vegas by providing whatever aid they could. Matthew Hemm, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said that he and his friends went to the Red Cross to donate blood on Monday. He said he knew several dozen people who had gone to the Route 91 Harvest festival, all of whom were accounted for without injury. However, he wished he could have been there to help, as he is a licensed paramedic.
“I’m still in awe, like it’s not real,” Hemm wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Many of my friends are traumatized … having been in the zone of gunfire, seeing people physically shot.”
Provost Michael Quick sent a community-wide memorandum Monday afternoon showing support for members of the Trojan Family who were in any way impacted by the shooting in Las Vegas.
“We are deeply saddened by the horrific events in Las Vegas,” the memo read. “The images from the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history are difficult to view, and it’s even more difficult to imagine the pain and anguish being experienced by the families and loved ones of the victims. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them.”
Quick also sent out a memo regarding the campus lockdown, advising students to contact Student Counseling Services or the Eric Cohen Student Health Center if they were affected by the day’s events.
“In the aftermath of the tragic events in Las Vegas on Sunday, we understand this a time of stress and anxiety,” Quick wrote in the memo. “We want to remind you of the counseling resources we have available.”
Burklo reiterated this message at Monday’s vigil, reassuring students that the USC staff is here to support them.
“But we are not your best resource — you are,” Burklo said. “We all need to care for each other and  look out for each other.”

The Undergraduate Student Government recently partnered with Calm, a meditation and mindfulness app intended to help users reduce stress and anxiety in their daily lives.
The partnership hopes to combat the rise in student stress levels as the semester progresses by improving the accessibility of mental health tools, placing them in students’ pockets.
With daily meditations, sleep stories and relaxing music, Calm aims to improve students’ focus and mindfulness.
USC was chosen as one of the schools whose students and faculty would receive the app for free, as opposed to paying the $60 subscription fee, when signing up with their USC email. Other schools in the partnership include Harvard University, Princeton University and University of Notre Dame.
Over the  summer, USG Senator Buck Andrews worked with the creators of Calm to bring the app to USC.
“It’s a prestigious program, we’re really excited to be a part of it,” Andrews said. “Calm is an excellent resource for people to daily take care of themselves and work on their stressors and really love themselves.”
Andrews began using Calm while studying abroad in Italy and was fascinated by the app’s features.
“[I] really found mindfulness to be something that was so important and something that I didn’t value prior to Calm,” Andrews said.
Mindfulness is a practice that can be overlooked by students in their busy lives, said Allen Weiss, the co-chair of Mindful USC. Weiss defines mindfulness as the “ability to pay attention to what is going on in the present moment.”
According to Weiss, mindfulness helps improve students’ ability to react to stressful situations in less extreme ways.
“Mindfulness helps calm down the emotions,” Weiss said. “When people actually learn the practice … it lowers their anxiety and stress in all sorts of different ways.”
Calm offers a variety of meditation options, from beginner sessions to more advanced options that focus on anxiety and personal growth. The app also includes stories to help users sleep as well as music for focusing and relaxation.
“Stress is how our body responds to demands placed in our lives,” said Yong Park, a staff psychologist at USC Student Counseling Services.
Park emphasized that not all stress is bad, and students should focus on controlling the amount of stress they feel.
“When we experience stress, the brain sends signals to the body to release stress hormones and what these hormones do is activate the flight or flight response,” Park said. “Basically, it activates the body to take some form of action and in that case how we channel that stress is more important than if we have stress.”
With short and accessible meditation sessions, Park said that apps like Calm are an easy avenue for students to decrease stress in their daily lives.
“These brief relaxation exercises really help students … to slow down and relax their bodies so they can feel more in control of themselves,” Park said. “It’s something brief, but it can make a big difference.”
The introduction of Calm is just one component of an overall push by USC to help students with their mental health. The Academic Culture Assembly’s Mental Health Month is underway, with activities and discussions planned throughout October.
Mindful USC will also be launching its own mental health app in the coming weeks, and the Counseling Center continues to offer activities and support.
