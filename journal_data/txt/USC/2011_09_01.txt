USC secondary coach Willie Mack Garza has resigned, citing personal issues, the school announced Thursday.
“I stepped down today from my coaching duties at USC,” Garza said in a statement. “I have some personal issues unrelated to USC that I need to address. I wish the Trojans the best and I am sorry I won’t be with them in what I know will be a very successful season.”
Garza was not at USC’s mid-morning practice early Thursday, while it was in the midst of final preparations for Saturday’s season opener against Minnesota.
Though the school declined to comment further, multiple reports released Thursday, including one from CBS Sports, said Garza’s resignation from his position directly stemmed from his involvement in an NCAA investigation centering on former scout Willie Lyles.
Lyles, along with his lawyers, met with NCAA investigators Tuesday, when he disclosed that he had a previous working relationship with Garza. USC officials learned of Lyles’ connection to Garza on Wednesday, according to CBS Sports.
The NCAA’s investigation of Lyles’ scouting services, which are allegedly connected to LSU and Oregon, is still ongoing.
Serving as the defensive backs coach at Tennessee during the 2009 season, Garza arrived at USC along with coach Lane Kiffin, who accepted the position in January 2010.
Garza’s relationship with Lyles, however, is said to predate his time at Tennessee.
Former USC safety Sammy Knight, who played in the NFL for 12 seasons and has been on staff as graduate assistant, is expected to replace Garza on an interim basis.

For the USC women’s soccer team, things haven’t begun the way USC coach Ali Khosroshahin envisioned.
“We haven’t been good enough yet,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s that simple. We need to be better.”
Offensive threat · Senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge has scored two goals and assisted on two others for the Women of Troy this season. - Daily Trojan file photo
Following a lackluster start to the 2011 season, the Women of Troy (1-3) will get a chance to even their record with a Midwest road trip this weekend. USC will take on No. 17 Illinois and Purdue in what the coach and his players believe will be a tough test for the team.
“They’re both very solid teams, very hard working teams,” Khosroshahin said. “We’re going to have to play well to have a chance against both of them.”
The Women of Troy will have their hands especially full with the Fighting Illini (4-0), as the contest is a rematch of last year’s NCAA first round contest in South Bend, Ind., which USC won 3-1 in the first-ever meeting between the two squads.
“We know Illinois hasn’t forgotten about that,” senior forward/defender Ashley Freyer said. “They’re going to be coming out hard to try and get a win against us.”
USC’s showdown with Purdue (1-3) is also the second-ever meeting between the two programs. The Women of Troy won the inaugural meeting last season in Fullerton, Calif., by a final count of 1-0.
“Every team wants to come out and beat ’SC,” senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge said. “We try not to worry about individual records and stuff like that because we know every one is gunning for us.”
Though the Fighting Illini and the Boilermakers will present their own problems, Khosroshahin believes the Women of Troy needs to amend their own mistakes and faulty play before the team can focus too overtly on its opponent.
“Our biggest opponent that we face every day is ourselves,” Khosroshahin said. “When this group is determined and focused, I know we can compete against anyone in the country. But you have to have that consistency for 90 minutes, not 87 minutes.”
The players echoed similar sentiments.
“We’re still trying to figure out how to fix our own things from last weekend,” Freyer said. “It’s definitely something that’s day by day. We’re trying to bring every element together. The first three games we played great soccer lost. It’s just figuring out how to win that’ll be the challenge.”
Khosroshahin, while not pleased with the team’s early season struggles, believes the less than stellar start will force USC to increase its focus on game days.
“We’ve been trying to raise our intensity and our desire to compete,” Khosroshahin said. “That goes for every single play. There can’t be any lapses.”
USC will square off against Illinois at 4 p.m. on Friday and take on Purdue at 10 p.m. on Sunday. The two-game Midwest trek is the last half of a four-game road trip for the Women of Troy before they play seven of their next eight at home at McAlister Field. The first four games of that stretch come as part of the Trojan Invitational next weekend.
“It’ll be nice to get home but we can’t look that far ahead,” Khosroshahin said. “We’ve got a job to do and I expect we’ll do it.”

No. 25 USC practiced for the last time on Thursday at Howard Jones Field before its season opener at home against Minnesota on Saturday afternoon.
With more than 30 new players looking to play their first game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday, there remained an air of excitement and buzz around the field, particularly from freshman kicker Andre Heidari, the starter following the graduation of Joe Houston.
“It’s a team effort, and everyone’s putting in work here,” Heidari said. “I know when I get in there I’m going to be all pumped up, it’s going be loud [but] I’m going to be focused. I don’t have jitters yet, but Friday — I don’t know if I’m going to be able to get some sleep.”
The Trojans open the season with questions at several positions, namely at tailback. Sophomore Dillon Baxter, freshman Amir Carlisle, junior Curtis McNeal and freshman D.J. Morgan are still vying to start, following senior Marc Tyler’s suspension.
Of the four starters, Baxter was the only one to log carries in 2010, finishing with 252 yards and one touchdown on 54 carries. Carlisle was still in high school, McNeal was academically ineligible and Morgan was recovering from ACL surgery and redshirted as a result.
Joining the four in the backfield is former tight end and newly named team captain Rhett Ellison, who has showcased his versatility as a fullback. He and freshman Soma Vainuku are expected to see the majority of playing time at the position.

Thursday remained a light practice with players suiting up in just shoulder pads and gym shorts. There didn’t appear to be a dropoff in intensity, however, especially during special teams drills. The scout team wore UCLA-colored jerseys, which grabbed everyone’s attention.
“Hopefully they’ll be motivated to get off the service team so they won’t have to wear the powder blue jerseys,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
When asked further whether there was a deeper message: “Not really,” Kiffin said. “We were bored.”
The offense ran a lot of goal line sets Thursday, showing a focus on what junior left tackle Matt Kalil termed as “finishing games,” something that was problematic for the Trojans last season.
The defense, meanwhile, stayed true to its “that’s our ball” slogan and was constantly looking to strip the ball from offensive players. After practice ended, the team grouped together and held somewhat of an emotional rally to get focused for Saturday’s game.

Senior linebacker Chris Galippo practiced Thursday and appears ready to play this weekend despite missing a few practices this week. Freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson has been receiving repetitions at middle linebacker, as Galippo has been rehabbing an injured back. Kiffin said he expects to figure the highly regarded Dawson into the rotation even if Galippo is healthy enough to play.
The offensive guard position seems to have been somewhat solidified, with sophomore John Martinez and junior Jeremy Galten getting a majority of the first team reps Thursday. The depth chart at the wide-receiver position seems clearer as well, with freshman Marquise Lee, redshirt freshman Kyle Prater and junior Brice Butler getting the majority of reps opposite sophomore Robert Woods.
Injured redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins was on the field as well, throwing passes with his left hand and getting involved with the offensive play calling.
Scroggins tore ligaments in his throwing thumb earlier in camp and his status remains unknown. With Scroggins sidelined, freshman quarterback Cody Kessler will serve as the team’s primary backup to Barkley, should the junior signal caller be sidelined.

Looking to rebound after a disappointing loss to No. 2 Penn State last weekend, the No. 3 USC women’s volleyball team heads east to face off against a collection of Florida schools in the FGCU Homewood Suites Invitational Sept. 2-3 before setting their sights on a nonconference matchup with Clemson on Sunday.
History · Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter is looking to become USC’s first three-time All-American since Bibiana Candelas in 2005. - Daily Trojan file photo
“We face challenges we didn’t count on as [Central Florida] is playing pretty well, the local team Florida Gulf Coast will be pretty competitive,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We have to be careful playing the home team at home. We wanted an easier matchup at Furman, but they beat Wisconsin and took one [set] from Duke, so we have our work cut out for us this weekend.”
On tap first, the Women of Troy (1-1) will face off against an upstart UCF team (2-1) that is led by one of Haley’s former assistants in Todd Dagenais, who coached at USC from 2005-2007. Dagenais, now in his fourth season with the Golden Knights, will need to rely on sophomore outside hitter Angelica Crump, who leads the team in kills, if they are to take down USC.
After the Women of Troy face off against UCF, they will battle Florida Gulf Coast (2-1), which is playing on its home turf and looking to even the all-time series after falling to USC when it played at the Galen Center in 2009. Haley will look to offset the hitting of the Eagles’ outside/middle hitter Jill Hopper with a steady dose of senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter and junior outside hitter/opposite Katie Fuller.
“We saw UCF coming out of the airport and they look huge,” Haley said. “Plus Furman already has a few upsets, so we have a tough weekend ahead.”
In its final draw of the two-day tournament, USC faces Furman, led by long-standing coach Michelle Young, for the first time in program history. The Women of Troy will be forced to contend with junior outside hitter Chandler Ambrester.
Rounding out the weekend, USC hopes to hand Clemson (3-0) its first loss of the season in what is also the first meeting between these schools. This will be the first real test for the Tigers as they look to capitalize on the fatigue that might set in on the Women of Troy once Sunday rolls around.
“Clemson is a good team. We always come into a game confident we can win,”  Haley said.” They’re definitely a team to watch out for though.”
Despite the early season hiccup at the hands of the then-top-ranked Nittany Lions, USC is poised for a big season as its returns three All-Americans from last year’s Final Four squad in Jupiter, as well as senior setter Kendall Bateman and senior middle blocker Lauren Williams.
“We have a lot of people playing hard right now and we want to give everyone some time,“ Haley said. “It just depends on how the weekend works itself out.”
Jupiter, in particular, has gotten off to a hot start to the season, ranking fourth in the Pac-12 in kills, as she looks to become USC’s first three-time All-American since Bibiana Candelas in 2005. The French native is also on the cusp of passing Keao Burdine to become USC’s all-time leader in points scored. She also ranks 10th in kills on the Women of Troy’s all-time list.
USC will return home from its Labor Day weekend road trip to face UCLA on Sept. 9 at Galen Center, marking the team’s first home match of the season.
 
Looking forward to seeing Trojans play against the Matadors tonight at CSUN.  I hope the Matadors pull off an upset at their season home-opene…anything can happen. Go Matadors!

The three-time defending national champion No. 1 USC men’s water polo team is approaching unprecedented territory.
California remains the only other NCAA Division I men’s water polo program to have ever won three consecutive national championships, a feat it accomplished twice.
Stopper · Senior goalie Joel Dennerley has keyed USC’s defense and helped lead the Trojans to three straight NCAA championships. - Daily Trojan file photo
No team has ever won four in a row.
With the Trojans returning every starter from their 2010 title team — a team that outscored its opponents 382-183, begs the question: Can anyone derail the Trojans’ recent string of success?
“The team is very experienced now, as we are returning our top players from last year,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “There is great competition for every position. We are three-deep, even four-deep, at almost every position”
The Trojans will test that depth this weekend, as they jump into the pool Sunday for their first contests of the regular season, facing Fresno Pacific and UC Irvine as part of the UCI Invitational.
USC does not have many question marks because, by Vavic’s count, it returns its top 13 players from this past season, including their three leading scorers in sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie, junior driver Peter Kurzeka and sophomore driver Nikola Vavic, and the reigning Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Year senior goalie Joel Dennerley.
“Our starters are back, very healthy and hungry,” Vavic said. “We also have quite a few new players and guys who have redshirted. So the competition for playing time has been fierce.”
No starting spot is guaranteed, at least according to Vavic, a e coach who has won a combined nine MPSF Coach of the Year awards between the men and women’s circuits.
Vavic said redshirt freshman goalie Ely Bonilla, who was named MVP of the first annual 21-and-under junior Olympics, has battled Dennerly for playing time thus far through training camp.
“Having Bonilla is a huge plus for us,” Vavic said. “Having another goalie is going to push [Dennerley] a little bit.”
With so much roster depth, Vavic notes the Trojans will rotate many players in and out of the lineup to keep starters fresh.
“Some of the freshmen will have a chance to play right away,” Vavic said. “[Freshman driver] Mark Vonderweidt already has shown some signs of greatness. [Freshman driver Konstantinos Genidounias], a kid from Greece, has a chance to help immediately. He was the MVP of the 18-and-under European Water Polo Championship last year, but he’s not going to join until the end of the [Junior World Championships] in September.”
Last season, as USC sets its eyes on a third consecutive title, Vavic informed his team, which featured no seniors at the time, what it would take to win another national championship, reiterating on several occasions the team could not let complacency set in.
Vavic does not anticipate such problems to settle in.
“Complacency is definitely the biggest obstacle,” Vavic said. “There are always some players that are happy they won a championship, or two, or three. You have to watch out for those, but we do have a very competitive young group of players.”
Those leaders, Dennerley and Kurzeka, as well as junior two-meter Brian Boswell, junior driver Michael Rosenthal and senior two-meter Matt Burton, have all been key contributers in USC’s run of dominance. The group, all part of the same recruiting class, has never known a finish to the season that did not involve pushing coach Vavic into a pool following an NCAA championship win.
Though most teams will recognize the Trojans as the preseason favorite, most, if not all, of the upper-echelon teams can point to minor mistakes they made against USC — situations that altered the outcomes of close games — as the reason why they are not the NCAA champions.
California, Stanford and UCLA will remain formidable, and an upstart Pacific team could also make noise before the season ends. In a league of such parity, there is no time to bask in past victories.
“We’ve been training very hard, and I’m really pleased with our physical fitness coming back from the break,” Vavic said. “This is probably the fittest team we’ve had returning from the break. A lot of that has to do with our leadership and our seniors setting the tone.”

Don’t be fooled by the sanction-imposed façade hovering over the USC football season because there is still plenty at stake in 2011.
Sure, a bowl ban can diminish BCS title hopes or attendance numbers — as was evident by some of the sparse crowds at the Los Angeles Coliseum last year — but no longer can the past be used as a scapegoat for the present.
Last season’s up-and-down 8-5 campaign served as a landmark year for Trojan apologists, who turned to every excuse in the book: A new coaching regime, a less-than-physical fall camp, a still-maturing sophomore quarterback, a difficult defensive scheme and more.
The excuses for last year’s easily forgettable season seemed semi-reasonable, however, given the calamity of circumstances that hindered future progress for the program.
But year two of the Lane Kiffin era begins tomorrow afternoon, and with it comes the abolishment of the “Get out of jail free” cards the Trojans seemed to pile up in 2010. I plead with you to hold Kiffin and his squad to a higher standard.
Expecting success is not a sign of entitlement, especially when all of the pieces are in place for a hallmark season.
While a January trip to New Orleans will not be in the cards this year — undefeated or otherwise — from the sounds of it, the Trojans’ pursuit of perfection has not wavered. Though substance-free clichés like “we plan to win the games on our schedule” and “a bowl ban doesn’t mean we can’t go undefeated” were repeated throughout fall camp, now is not the time to let those words fall on deaf ears.
Make each player accountable.
For the first time in his head coaching career, Kiffin will actually have a chance to perform his duties for a second full season. Potential NCAA violations, said to have occurred while at the University of Tennessee, are now in the rear view mirror. Twenty-one months have come and gone for him to sink his teeth into a supposed dream job, and more so than any previous roster placed before him, there is pure talent and depth at just about every position.
For junior quarterback Matt Barkley, this season is not just another stepping stone to playing on Sundays, it’s a résumé-defining year. Barkley has been afforded the rare opportunity to play in a pro-style offense since the day he stepped foot onto campus back in 2009.
His cookie jar this season is finally full of top-notch targets, in sophomore Robert Woods, junior Brandon Carswell and freshmen Marquise Lee and George Farmer. He has potential All-Americans protecting him in senior fullback Rhett Ellison and junior left tackle Matt Kalil and a cerebral center in junior Khaled Holmes to lead an otherwise inexperienced offensive line.
Under former coach Pete Carroll, the keys to the castle were initially bestowed upon him without prior merit, and now the third-year starter has a chance to pay it forward.
In doing so, while he won’t end his season raising a trophy full of oranges like Carson Palmer or Matt Leinart, something tells me Barkley won’t need much luck if he leaves for April’s NFL draft.
At 71 years old, assistant head coach and defensive guru Monte Kiffin doesn’t exactly need a fire lit under him as the season gets underway. But for a career that has spanned six decades, no season could have left a worse taste in the former Super Bowl champion’s mouth than last year’s defensive debacle — the worst statistical season since USC began keeping track in 1955.
The defensive guru has very little to prove at this stage in his career, yet for a man the Tampa-2’s second-act in Southern California needs to be better than its debut. Or we might be watching its swan song.
Individual standouts from a year ago — junior safety T.J. McDonald and sophomore Nickell Robey — return  to solidify the secondary. Though both bursted onto the scene last season, the next three months present an opportunity for the tandem to leap from one-hit wonders to elite playmakers.
Health is no longer a concern on the defensive line as senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou  and junior defensive end Nick Perry finally look to be at full-strength for the first time since 2009. Add in Devon Kennard’s transition back to defensive end, and USC’s versatility along the front seven might parallel that of the historic 2008 unit.
Even on special teams, I am happy to report that Houston, we have no more problems making comical field goals from inside the 35, thanks to the right leg of true freshman Andre Heidari, whose range is projected to be from 49 to 52 yards out.
Needless to say, you should demand more from this year’s team across the board.
For those of you who bleed cardinal and gold, it’s not time to get defensive, it’s time to turn the tables away from self-sympathy. Let’s ring in the new season by adopting a slightly tailored mantra: You can’t sanction high expectations.

Too many questions in the offseason, too few answers to know exactly what to expect.
Will the defense be better? Will the offensive line hold up? Who will start at running back?
On Saturday at 12:30 p.m., some of those lingering doubts should begin to disappear.
Expectations · The coaching staff believes junior quarterback Matt Barkley is ready to improve upon his sophomore campaign. Tabbed as one of four captains heading into the season, Barkley hopes to throw 30 touchdown passes and complete 70 percent of his passes in 2010. - Daily Trojan file photo
In its season opener, No. 25 USC hosts Minnesota, a team that compiled a 3-9 record last season and finished second to last in the Big Ten. Despite its poor finish that led to the firing of Minnesota’s then-coach Tim Brewster in mid-October, the Trojans insist they aren’t taking the Golden Gophers lightly.
“They have a whole different coaching staff and they know how to get their players fired up,” junior left tackle Matt Kalil said. “It’ll be a completely different team than last year and we can’t let this team catch us off guard.”
Taking over for Brewster on the sidelines is first-year coach Jerry Krill, who spent three seasons at Northern Illinois, leading the Huskies to a 10-win season in 2010 and an appearance in the uDrove Humanitarian Bowl.
Former wide-receiver-turned- quarterback MarQueis Gray, a dual-threat quarterback, returns, but this time he will line up under center. For a defensive unit that has historically struggled against mobile quarterbacks such as Oregon’s Darron Thomas and Washington’s Jake Locker, the coaching staff knows it will serve as a big test.
“It’s going to be a big challenge for us,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “He’s not just a mobile quarterback, but he’s a big, physical quarterback. We’re going to have our hands full. This is a very, very big challenge for our defense right away.”
Outside of Gray, Minnesota returns senior running back Duane Bennett and senior wide receiver Da’John McKnight, who led the team in receptions and touchdowns a year ago. Both have the ability to make big plays, something the Trojans are quite familiar with.
For a unit that was ranked 84th in total defense last season, giving up 400 yards per game and almost 27 points per contest, they understand they have a lot to prove.
“We need to show that we got better in the secondary against the pass and we need to show that we can tackle,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “I think we’ve gotten better overall in camp, but we just have to play our defense and pay attention to our coverages.”
Another lingering question mark has been a young offensive line, which features no senior starters. The Trojans lost right tackle Tyron Smith and center Kristofer O’Dowd to the NFL, while also dealing with injuries in fall camp. Only junior left tackle Matt Kalil will be playing a familiar position, with junior Khaled Holmes moving from right guard to center. All of this leaves some uncertainty heading into Saturday, although junior quarterback Matt Barkley expressed no concern at all.
“I’m not worried,” Barkley said. “We’ll deal with it in the game. If mistakes come, then so be it. But I think these guys are ready.”
Though a couple questions remain about who will start up front to protect Barkley, there is even more doubt as to whom will start at tailback. With senior Marc Tyler suspended, the job has been a free-for-all among junior Curtis McNeal, sophomore Dillon Baxter, redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan and freshman Amir Carlisle. Of the four, only Baxter logged carries in 2010.
The coaching staff has not indicated which player will get the starting nod yet, although all four tailbacks have earned praise during fall camp for their play.
Though Barkley might have some unfamiliar faces around him on offense, one welcoming sign will be sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who was named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in 2010 after finishing with 65 receptions for 792 yards and six touchdowns.
During last season’s contest against the Gophers, USC recovered from a sluggish start and a late 14-13 deficit to win by a score of 32-21. Sparking the comeback was Woods, who returned a punt to give the Trojans a lead they would never relinquish. As one of the Trojans’ six returning starters on offense, Woods knows the coaching staff expects a strong sophomore campaign.
“The coaching staff expects a lot from me,” Woods said. “As a leader this year, they’re expecting me to make plays and be ready to carry the load.”
While the Trojans, who haven’t played a game since their season finale against UCLA last December, might be a bit anxious, they insist the visiting Gophers have their full attention.
“We look at them like any other team on our schedule,” Robey said. “But it’s about us. We’re taking care of our issues first and keeping a level head.”

Travis Amsbaugh, a Dept. of Public Safety officer who served two tours in Afghanistan, died early Thursday morning in a single car collision in south Orange County. He was 26.

“DPS is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Officer Amsbaugh,” DPS Chief Carey Drayton said in an email. “Although he was relatively new to the department, he was quickly embraced by our officers, and he was a valued member of the Trojan Family.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said a witness at the accident reported that Amsbaugh’s car drifted off the side of the road and fell into a ditch. The cause of the accident is unknown. Amsbaugh was pronounced dead at the scene, Denise Quesada, a California Highway Patrol officer, told the Orange County Register.
A graduate of the Rio Hondo Police Academy and an avid Oakland A’s fan, Amsbaugh joined DPS in July 2011 as part of an expansion of DPS’ field training, Carlisle said. He was in his second phase of training.
Before joining DPS, Amsbaugh served in the Marine Corps for six years.
His friends remember him as a “friendly, outgoing [and] well-liked guy,” Carlisle said.
Amsbaugh is survived by his mother and father who live in Northern California. DPS said on its website that they will announce funeral arrangements when the information is available.
“Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends,” Drayton said.
DPS has lost two employees over the last month. David Beeler, a security system engineer, suffered from an untimely heart attack in early August.
With a heavy heart I send my deepest sympathy to Minda, her mother Madeline and all the family and friends.  Nancy Price, Sparks, NV
Our thoughts and prayers are with Minda and Craig, his parents and sister.Alexion. Our sons went to school together in Castro Valley California..He was just at our sons funeral 4 months ago. Very tragic,to loose 26 year olds, so much life still ahead of them….But God has the ultimate plan…With deepest sympathy Helen and Bryan Cadinha

In an effort to improve security on campus, the Dept. of Public Safety plans to unveil a new smart phone application Saturday for reporting anonymous tips about disorderly conduct or crimes.
Submit · The app sends anonymous tips directly to the Dept. of Public Safety. - Photo Illuustration by David Lowenstein
TipSubmit is specifically intended for use during football games and will be unveiled before the first football game of the year, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said. It is only available for Android phones and iPhones.
Carlisle said it will be easier to use than the current anonymous tip service, Trojans Care 4 Trojans, which allows students to call or text both a communications center that forwards messages to relevant organizations in the USC community.
The new app also serves thousands of communities, universities and law enforcement agencies around the country, including the University of California San Diego, California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Opisbo and Los Angeles City College.
The new app will allow users to contact DPS directly with information. It is formatted so users can also see if an incident has already been reported to DPS.
“We think the easier we make it, the more people will use it,” Carlisle said. “It is more likely people will use [the new system].”
Some students said taking pictures of someone might look strange.
“It may look kind of suspicious if you start taking pictures of an incident,” said Kevin Koeller, a freshman majoring in business administration. “Plus it might make things worse if someone sees you taking pictures of them.”
Several students also said they believed having this smart phone application would allow more incidents to be reported.
“Our generation is very hands-on and connected,” said Dani Haberman, a sophomore majoring in theatre. “[Having the app] at your fingertips will incline more people to report incidents.”
The app eliminates the need to use the current anonymous tip service through text messages or by telephone, which many students do not utilize.
“More people will use the app, because it seems like it will be very fast and easy,” said Monroe Ekilah, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science. “I haven’t sent in an anonymous tip because I don’t know the number [for Trojans Care 4 Trojans].”
The photo feature on the app will instantly provide DPS with photographical evidence for neutralizing incidents.
“[I believe] the ability to submit photographs will be helpful for DPS,” said Karina Garcia, a senior majoring in Spanish. “[It] will allow DPS to know about the incident beforehand and how [they should] handle it.”
TipSubmit is available for free download on application markets.
Thank you for publicizing this tool – it could save a life.
I know who likes a snitch: the victim of that person’s mean or careless actions. Thank you, DPS, for providing another mechanism for making USC a safe and friendly place.
Nobody likes a snitch

Crowds of excited students have cheered for Traveler’s jaunt around the Coliseum for 50 years.
During the years, students at the USC have watched with pride as the pure white horse galloped across the Coliseum after every touchdown. This Saturday marks the start of Traveler’s fiftieth year at USC.
Past and Present · Current handler Hector Aguilar rides Traveler VII, a pure Spanish Andalusian purebreed. The current mascot turned 20 this year. - Daily Trojan File Photo
The tradition of bringing a horse to football games began in 1927, when Louis Shield, a USC student, started riding a white horse at home football games, according to Traveler’s official website.
Whenever USC scores during a football game, Traveler and his current rider, Hector Aguilar, ride around the Coliseum while the band plays “Conquest,” USC’s regal processional march.
“Traveler embodies the Spirit of Troy,” said Jeff Brown, vice president of Trojan Knights.
Several Trojan Knights are members of the Traveler support group, which helps guarantee Traveler’s comfort, making sure the game runs smoothly and that the horse has enough space to run.
In 1954, Arthur J. Gontier III, a Trojan Knight, rented a white horse, and while wearing a traditional Trojan costume previously used by actor Jeff Chandler, rode the horse inside the stadium before the kickoff of a USC-Pittsburgh game, according to Andy Greos, Trojan Knight activity director.
Traveler I officially started galloping around the stadium with rider Richard Saukko in 1961, said Joanne Asman, Traveler VII’s owner and trainer.
In the last 50 years, there have been seven different Travelers. The original horse was a white Arabian-Tennessee Walker, but Traveler VII is of pure Spanish Andalusian breed.
Asman has owned horse Traveler VII for 16 years, but she took over the program to officially train Traveler for USC football games and school-related activities in 2003.
“[Traveler] is my soul mate,” Asman said. “This horse and I have a very special connection, from the first time I ever saw him. We totally understand each other.”
What makes Traveler such an USC iconic mascot is his character, Asman said.
“He has to like people, he has to be willing and want to please and he has to be trusting,” Asman said. “It takes a certain kind of temperament and personality to have a horse that will put up with 90,000 people.”
Traveler VII, who turned 20 years old this year, will continue riding at USC games until he decides he’s ready to retire, Asman said.
In preparation for Traveler VII’s retirement, Asman is currently training Traveler VIII. This involves activities like showing the horse different objects present at football games — including mascots that might be on the field — so Traveler VIII can become acclimated to the stadium atmosphere, according to his trainer.
The training timeline differs depending on the horse, but Traveler VIII has already started to get a feel for game days.
“Traveler VIII has snuck in there a few times and people didn’t even notice we switched horses,” Asman said.
The statue of Traveler on campus across from Tommy Trojan is modeled after Traveler VII, and Asman said she was sure the tradition of Traveler will live on.

A sea of cardinal and gold poured into the Galen Center Thursday night as hundreds of students came together to celebrate USC athletics.
Fall rallies in previous years focused only on USC football, but all sports were featured this year.

“USC is more than just a football school,” said Daniel Ramirez, director of Trojan Pride and rally organizer. “We are an athletic powerhouse.”
Naa Adei Mante, a freshman majoring in engineering, said she left the rally more excited about USC athletics than she was before.
“I’m so pumped right now,” she said.  “It was exhilarating and I can’t wait to see what USC sports have in store this fall.”
In addition to cheering on athletes from all sports, the Trojan Marching Band, Spirit Leaders, Song Girls and the Trojan Dance Force performed.
Arrogant Nation blogger Zack Jerome hosted the event and introduced the teams present.
“USC is home to some amazing athletes,” Jerome said. “This university has more Olympic gold medals than most countries.”
Senior women’s tennis player Alison Ramos said the rally was “absolutely electrifying.”
“This is the first rally I have attended and it was so amazing that I regret not going to one during my first years here,” Ramos said. “The Galen Center was the perfect location for something like this and it added so much too the overall experience.”
Women’s volleyball coach Mick Haley said he was not surprised the Galen Center was selected to house the event.
“It’s clearly the best place on campus for a rally,” Haley said. “With 10,000 seats, gorgeous views of the San Gabriel Mountains, and easy student access, it’s ideal for an event like this.”
Collaboration between several student organizations and the athletic department brought the rally to the Galen Center.
“It’s a much better suited location than Heritage Hall or somewhere outside,” said Monish Tyagi, Undergraduate Student Government president. “The acoustics, air conditioning and beautiful space added a great deal to the entertainment value of the event.”
Men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill called the rally a huge success.
“Bringing everyone together under one roof was a really smart thing,” he said. “It was also a smart idea to focus on all sports and encourage everyone to support each other.”
Junior quarterback Emon Saee said he feels more closely connected to non-football athletes after sharing classes, training rooms and participating in Thursday’s rally.
“I began feeling more connected to other student-athletes the moment I enrolled in the fall of 2010,” Saee said. “I think it’s awesome all fall sports are being recognized because all athletes work hard and deserve to be appreciated.”
When USC athletics were more intertwined in the 1960s and 1970s, an increase in sports and practice space has challenged USC athletics to remain closely unified, according to Haley.
“With so many sports operating outside Heritage Hall, it’s easy for programs to get segregated,” Haley said.  “But in order for athletes to be the best they can be, they have to network, respect, and build relationships with one another. That’s what the Trojan Family is all about.”
Conrad are you dense, Mick Haley is not a she per your line about “said she was not surprised”. Another thing the woman volleyball team was not even in town playing in Florida today. Who the heck were you interviewing anyways?
It is pure laziness not to proof read what you supposedly wrote.
More pictures would have been nice for the online edition. C’mon, man.

Renowned comic book artist Joann Sfar creates a glorified tribute to the late, infamous singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg with his new film, Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life.
Talented flirt · Sfar creates a stunning portrait of one of his favorite artists, Serge Gainsbourg, and crafts elements of the artist’s music, lovemaking, caricatures and idiosyncracies to create a well-rounded picture. - Photo courtesy of Music Box Films
The film carries itself as a combination of glamorized memoir and Sfar’s own imaginative artistry. Though the movie quickly skims over the details of Gainsbourg’s personal life, it stands as a fantastic salute to the music, fame and inner demons of the notorious musician.
The film follows young Serge Gainsbourg (Eric Elmosnino) — born Lucien Ginsburg — from his childhood as a Jewish boy in Nazi-occupied Paris to his fame later in life, deftly taking audiences through his compelling adventures in music and lovemaking. Forced as a young boy to wear a yellow star in the anti-Semitic era, the singer-songwriter sees a Nazi poster of an exaggerated Jewish caricature, complete with large ears and a foot-long “mug.” He hallucinates the caricature coming to life, and throughout his life it follows him as his alter-ego, embodying his self-consciousness, guilty pleasures and lustful attributes.
Sfar perfectly portrays Gainsbourg as a talented musician of mental instability. Through Gainsbourg’s arguments with the life-sized puppet, audiences are able to understand his deep internal struggles through an unconventional metaphor. The analogy is a powerful portrait of the musician’s suppression of his unhappiness and inhibitions. Though society in the ’60s saw him as a carefree celebrity, Sfar plunged into his deep insatiability with fame and perfection.
Sfar incorporates his subject’s music in a polished manner, avoiding spontaneous choreography and random singing typically seen in musicals. Instead, he eloquently introduces some of Gainsbourg’s most infamous songs through the musician’s writing process.
Whether Gainsbourg is pitching a song to a beautiful client or performing his latest hit to a crowded audience, Sfar incorporates the musician’s songs in an unexpectedly sophisticated manner. Sfar even renders his protagonist a musical chameleon, in which he integrates Gainsbourg’s ventures with reggae music toward the end of his career. Audiences are presented the spectrum of his music without corny or impulsive dance numbers.
With effortless piano skills and a smooth bass voice, Eric Elmosnino gives an ideal reprise to the artist’s life. He won best actor in the 2011 Cesar Awards and the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival for his ability to balance Gainsbourg’s sex appeal and song writing talent with his concealed insecurities about Gainsbourg’s appearance and self-worth.
Elmosnino impeccably elaborates on Gainsbourg’s infamy as a Casanova character, romancing such celebrities of the time as Juliette Greco, Jane Birkin and Brigitte Bardot.
Sfar’s lack of detail in Gainsbourg’s personal life, however, is undeniably frustrating. Hazy accounts of his marriages and the lack of children depicted in the movie make for a nebulous understanding of his personal life. It is unclear which women became his wives, and which children were biologically his own.
Sfar also leaves out the memorable and often controversial details of Gainsbourg’s life. He excludes Gainsbourg’s scandals, as well as some of his infamous television interviews. The director claimed, “I love Gainsbourg too much to bring him back to the realm of reality.”
Consequently, it is easy to appreciate Sfar’s admiration for Gainsbourg, especially because he deems his life “heroic” and glamorizes Gainsbourg’s adultery in the film.
The glamor present in Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life strays far from monotonous biography of mere chronology. With cartoon interludes, ’60s flair, fantastical editing and a soundtrack consisting mostly of Gainsbourg’s own work, it is indeed entertaining. If you do not mind the hazy biographical details or the constant reading of subtitles, then you can appreciate this chic tribute.
In the end, the film is a zesty celebration of the musician that led a reckless and frisky lifestyle. Audiences will grow to love the protagonist as a talented artist capable of sweeping any woman off her feet with romantic lyrics and catchy piano riffs. Sfar excels in developing the inner emotions and thoughts of his subject through a whimsical and often comedic life-sized caricature.

When Fright Night premiered a few weeks ago, Colin Farrell turned heads as a creature not seen in vampire canon for years — a genuine, unrepentant bad guy. Vampires have crept through cinema since 1913 as our flashier, crueler and sexier cousins. But in their century of celluloid glory, there has been a shift. Once, we had soulless undeads in need of stakings. Now we have vampires who sigh and cry and perform caesarian sections on their loved ones. Vampires have had an interesting cinematic life, one that has reflected shifts in our own thinking.

Vampires have their cinematic roots as supreme evil. In the 1913 silent film The Vampire, the vamp is not an undead ghoul, but a “vamp” in the slang sense of a femme fatale who sucks men dry. Max Schreck’s bat-spider lovechild figure from Germany’s 1922 Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror remains cinema’s first vision of the horror icon.
Yet vampires also give us a dark thrill. In 1933, Bela Lugosi starred in his legendary role as the charismatic but heartless Count Dracula. Though Lugosi looks different from the Brad Pitts and Ryan Goslings of today, his smoldering Dracula definitely caused a few ’30s housewives to squirm — and not out of horror. The vampire genre also explores less mainstream liaisons, such as the lesbian vampires in 1970’s The Vampire Lovers, which was based on the 19th-century novel Camilla.
Today our fanged friends are softer. They come tortured, lovelorn and achingly beautiful. A teeny-bopper example is Twilight’s Edward Cullen; an older one is True Blood’s Bill Compton. Even more brutal vampires like True Blood’s Eric Northman and Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s Spike come with an “except for my true love” clause.
We have Anne Rice to thank for some of this trend. Interview with The Vampire, the first novel of her Vampire Chronicles, was published in the late ’70s and filmed in 1994. On screen, Brad Pitt’s character spends more time bemoaning his immortality and evading the passes of Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas than biting jugulars.
Between the ’70s and the ’90s, there are other glimmers of less demonic vampires. Count Dracula is given a sympathetic nod in Francis Ford Coppola’s bombastic 1992 film; he might eat babies and let his brides gang rape house guests, but he really just misses his dead wifey.
These developments partially stem from a shift in our own views. Earlier America was more morally absolutist. There was Superman, good vs. evil and the United States vs. the commies. Over time, for many, this outlook has shifted to moral relativism — a tortured Batman, tragic backstories and a blurred line between right and wrong. Vampires garner sympathy for their harsh existences and thus have more protagonistic roles.
This ambiguity allows for interesting drama. Ferocity and compassion exist in terrifying balance in the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In, where a lonely, bullied boy finds a bloodthirsty companion and avenging angel in the vampire-girl-next-door. A more old-school example is Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, who became such a popular character that he got his own spin-off series.
One could argue we sometimes take moral relativism too far and turn our fierce and proud vampires into sparkling heartthrobs with a case of the mopies. At the same time, irredeemably bad vampires like the ones in I Am Legend or the recent Stake Land are shown as more monster than man.
Of course, the appeal of vampires has always gone beyond horror or moral quandaries. Vampires are dark and wild, and therefore sexy. They have eternal life and stamina, and let viewers indulge their dark sides without ending up in jail. As trends are cyclical, it’s no wonder we now have a film like the Fright Night remake, where Colin Farrell vamps out with his bad self. After all the sonnets and love triangles, it’s refreshing to get back to blood sucking. Vampires remain a treasured part of our pop culture, sparkles or not.

David Guetta knows how to drop a beat. Walk into a club any night and you’ll probably hear a track from this electronic mastermind. Nothing But The Beat is the fifth studio album from the Parisian DJ and producer who has made his way to the top of the charts with catchy, danceable tracks. Showcasing his skills for creating complex, movement-inducing electronic tunes, Nothing But The Beat proves Guetta’s popularity is matched by his undeniable skill.

Nothing But The Beat includes tracks with and without vocals. Surprisingly enough, the star power Guetta uses in his tracks, with vocals from artists like Taio Cruz and Timbaland, pales in comparison to the expertise he shows in his instrumental tracks.
In fact, the only huge downfall of the album is that, despite collaborations with veritable names from the pop world, the tracks with vocals are not always successful.
Certain tracks like “I Just Wanna F-” show a disparate quality between music and the lyrics. The track starts off with scintillating noises, a beat muffled in the background before coming to the foreground with the fast beat of a snare. The pairing of singer Dev and Timbaland sounds like a pop/dance match made in heaven, but the lyrics they sing are horribly cheesy. The track incorporates the theme of the alphabet with poorly written lines like, Imma L, M, N, O in your Ps and 26 letters of pleasure with me, which are close to being clever but end up sounding comical. That being said, the loud beat mixed with the daring and repetitive chorus “I Just Wanna F-” will likely make this song a party hit.
It’s disappointing that Guetta’s beats couldn’t be paired with better lyrics. Tracks like “Turn Me On” and “Little Bad Girl” only continue the trend of weak songwriting, trite situations and wasted opportunities.
But if you were looking forward to powerhouse collaborations that gave the best of the dance and the pop world, you need not be completely disappointed. A few gems, including the already chart-topping “Where Them Girls At,” manage to mesh Guetta’s adroit mixing with quality melodies and writing.
“Night of Your Life,” featuring Jennifer Hudson, is one of the most engaging tracks on the album. Though Hudson might not be the first person to come to mind when thinking of dance music, she manages to infuse the track with a sass and vocal dexterity that comes easily. Guetta pairs his high-energy sounds with Hudson’s range to create a song that is both dance-worthy and full of talent.
Similarly, “Nothing Really Matters,” featuring the Black Eyed Peas’ Will.i.am manages to show a chemistry some of the other tracks lack. Here, Will.i.am’s club-friendly voice meshes with Guetta’s artfully placed sounds, including violin notes that turn the track into an equally sentimental and groovy tune. The chorus is aggressive in the best sense, making it hard for listeners to stay still.
But Guetta’s true talent is best appreciated in the tracks where he can show off his electronic slickness alone.
“Glasgow” sounds like something that could be in an action movie. The rhythm stays pretty much the same but is transformed as Guetta alternates between making it deeper then crisper, and faster then slower. He builds up the tension expertly and presents layers of sound that creates a momentum that is irresistible.
But it’s “Toy Story” that takes Guetta’s finesse into a new level. The track begins simply before blossoming into a multi-layered tune that perfectly meshes an accessible beat with robot-like sounds that make you feel as if you’re entering some sort of dance video game.
Guetta aptly gauges where to slow down the track and build tension in order to create a satisfying dose of beautifully frenzied noise. He also pays attention to the details of the track, throwing in simple sounds to create a complex whole.
Near the end, the sounds get more dubstep-like and the beat slows as Guetta shows off his penchant for intergalactic noises. “Toy Story” is almost Daft Punk-like at moments, but Guetta’s talent for mixing a variety of tunes and making them coexist beautifully in one track is a talent all his own.
Though not every track on the album is a club hit or even a chart-topper, each track has obviously been carefully crafted and thought out by Guetta. In paying attention to even the smallest of details, Guetta has crafted something that will certainly keep electronic music lovers coming back for more.

The thriller genre tends to suffer from formula. Plots focus on an everyday man caught up in a grand conspiracy or a spy out to get a rival or those who set him up. In each respective case, the “thrills” of the genre come from the paranoia and action. Rarely does drama drive the suspense of one of these kinds of films.

Maybe its focus on its characters is part of what makes The Debt such a good film. The situation, the fear of discovery and death are all present, but the driving force of the movie is its characters. The film, a remake of the Israeli film (HaChov in Hebrew), bears a familiar setup with a more magnificent execution.
In 1966, a Mossad cell, made up of its leader Stefan (Martin Csokas), David (Sam Worthington) and new member Rachel (Jessica Chastain) entered East Germany to capture and extract a Mengele-like Nazi scientist (Jasper Christensen). But the film also runs a second plot, set in 1997 as the three Israelis (played here by Tom Wilkinson, Ciaran Hinds and Helen Mirren) have to deal with the repercussions as a book detailing their mission is approaching release.
The characters are the film’s main draw, and the actors are excellent. Rachel serves as the movie’s focal point, and Chastain and Mirren are great. Chastain plays Rachel with a nervous air, unsure of herself on her first mission, while Mirren is a jaded, bitter older woman. Csokas is interesting as the ambitious Stefan, an excellent leader who turns into a twitchy, angry person once things start going wrong.
Christensen also does well, avoiding the usual clichés of sinister Nazis. Instead, he is menacing and manipulative but never at any moment chews the scenery or invokes parody. His interactions with the cast are absolutely chilling.
One problem a film like this faces is the difference between the younger and older cast. The older actors must still be recognizable as the characters, but they can’t be carbon copies — for plot and acting reasons. The Debt’s actors give unique performances, but thanks to the revelations and events near the film’s conclusion, every difference feels justified and natural.
The film’s biggest surprise is Sam Worthington. The man is a great actor, and his films in Australia, such as 2006’s Macbeth, are excellent. Unfortunately, his American output has been nothing but action films, most of low caliber. Here, he redeems his skill. David is a tormented person, unsure of how to respond to people and driven with a desire for justice, nothing else. The moments where The Debt focuses on him are some of the best scenes in the film.
The film also challenges the characters. These are not Jason Bourne types, with little to worry about and a solid resolve. They’re driven but also susceptible to personal desires, which are put to the test. In the three leads’ interplay, The Debt ran the risk of jumping into a romantic cliché, but with each new piece of insight into who these people are, the more things become less stereotypical and much more compelling.
John Madden’s direction, working with a script co-written by Matthew Vaughn (director of this year’s X-Men: First Class), works on a slow burn. At first, it seems as if the film gives away major plot points, but again, as it goes on and each motivation is revealed, it’s clear the pacing is deliberate and smart.
Ben Davis’ cinematography (who also filmed the visually stunning Layer Cake and Stardust) gives the film a stark, but never dull feel. The ’90s scenes in Tel Aviv are bright and soft, reflecting the calm of the cast’s older age, while the scenes in East Berlin are wet and gray, sharp enough to heighten the tension.
If there is one problem with the film, it is that the music occasionally becomes overpowering, but the storytelling is too good for it to be more than a slight nuisance.
The Debt is an excellent thriller and one of the better spy films in recent memory. By focusing on the characters and putting a personal consequence to each action, the movie breaks both the mold of the genre and any possible cliché. It is definitely one of the year’s best films and should not be missed.

Unrest grew in South Africa yesterday outside the disciplinary hearing for controversial political figure Julius Malema, the man at the center of the divide in South Africa’s ruling party the African National Congress and the country itself.
Protests against the corruption charges levied against Malema, the president of the ANC’s Youth League, soon turned violent, with police needing to resort to stun grenades and water cannons to control the crowd.
This outburst captures the growing unrest amongst South Africa’s young black community. The unemployment rate in the country skyrocketed to an astounding 24.8 percent last year, two-thirds of which are under the age of 35. The high school drop out rate is at 64 percent and 1000 people die daily because of HIV-related illness.
Because of this, a large section of the black population has fallen behind Malema in claiming that they have been unfairly treated in the 17 years after apartheid. For example, Malema demands that South Africa’s white farmers hand over their profits to the black community without compensation as well as maintaining that the economically huge mining sector be nationalized and used to support the poor.
Jacob Zuma, president of both South Africa and the ANC, fears that if Malema gets his way it could cripple the economy even further. Most political experts prognosticate that he should also fear Malema himself taking control of the party and country, as the common belief is that no one can gain control of the country in its current climate without Malema’s backing. (Zuma included as he had Malema’s backing when he was elected in 2009)
The charges of corruption being levied against Malema are serious, embezzeling money for personal gain, and if he gets thrown out of the party it is impossible to know what political ripples it will send throughout the already struggling country.

In historical news, Elmhurst College in Elmhurst, Il., has become the first college in the entire nation to ask incoming students about their sexual orientation and gender identity on their college application.
The question, “Would you consider yourself to be a member of the LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] community?”, with response selections of “yes”, “no” and “prefer not to answer”, appears with other optional questions on the liberal arts school’s 2012-2013 application for enrollment.
But surprisingly enough, Elmhurst was not expecting to make headlines with their ground breaking addition; the college simply wanted to address the gap in both scholarships and services available to incoming students who identified as LGBT.
The college assures applicants’ responses to the questions will bear no weight in determining their likelihood of admission, and instead will serve as a better tool to identify prospective students as underrepresented groups. This recognition of LGBT youth as a minority group will give the institution more opportunities to distribute additional scholarships.
Incoming students and transfers who answer “yes” may be eligible for scholarships worth almost one-third of Elmhurst’s entire tuition and receive information about LGBT interest groups and organizations on campus. As the Dean of Admissions Gary Rold, stated in an interview with the Chicago Sun Times, “Increasing diversity is part of our {school’s} mission statement; this is simply closing the loop, in many ways, of another group who has a very strong identity. It may not be race and religion but it’s an important part of who they are.”
Rold reasoned being aware of students’ sexual orientation would help school officials better understand their incoming students and ready themselves to provide services and groups that might assist in easier transitions to college life.
USC could learn quite a bit from Elmhurst College. For example, The LGBT Resource Center, which sponsors academic, educational, social programs and advocacy services for the entire campus community, along with Program Board’s Queer and Ally Student Assembly, work tirelessly on campus, to ensure students are aware of both the events and programming they provide.
However, incoming students and transfers could be losing out on scholarship opportunities. The USC  Lambda LGBT Alumni Association awards scholarships to “incoming, undergraduate, and graduate USC students who show a commitment to the LGBT community, regardless of gender or sexual identity,” according to their website.
The specific scholarship information is available online, but if one was not directed towards the site initially, they could be missing out on enrollment-deciding financial aid, that could have otherwise been forwarded to them if a simple box was checked on their college application.

Fourteen of the 33 Chilean miners who survived more than three months underground after a mine collapse will receive lifetime pensions.
Presented by Chile’s first Lady Cecilia Morel on Tuesday, the ceremony took place in Copiano near the mine collapse site. She presented the first monthly pensions of 250,000 Chilean pesos ($540) to the men.
“This government is committed to be with you and help you as much as we can,” Morel said at the ceremony. The Chilean government fulfilled its goal of compensating more than 200 employees of the San Jose mine before the tragedy’s first anniversary.
The 14 recipients of the lifetime benefits however were chosen based on debilitating health, an age greater than 50 and perspective of the remaining survivors.
Several workers are still unemployed, or self-employed as fruit stand vendors and taxi drivers. According to CNN, the most successful ones have become public speakers, but the economic benefits are likely to diminish over time.
Survivor Jorge Galleguillos travelled to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC this August to open a mine collapse and rescue exhibit. Though seemingly well-off, Galleguillos reported that internationally he is respected as a hero, but in Chile he is greeted with little affection.
Many survivors are still heavily medicated and psychologically damaged, as detailed in Jonathan Franklin’s book 33 Men about the incident. After extensive interviews with the survivors, Franklin said to CNN, “I think they really needed better psychological counseling … but when they’re together they’re a band of brothers.”
Perhaps the 14 recipients of the lifetime pensions will overcome the financial and psychological misfortunes caused by their 69 day entrapment underground. The remaining 19 survivors can still be eligible for benefits in future evaluations.

When lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender issues are discussed, there’s usually a heavy emphasis on popular topics such as same-sex marriage.
There isn’t, however, enough focus on details. One of which is the challenge many transgender people face when carrying out daily tasks like using the restroom.
USC is home to a number of transgender students, yet few facilities accommodate them. Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center, said in a recent interview with the Daily Trojan that there have been 10 times more transgender students this year who have identified with the center than last year.
With this increase, USC should add more gender-neutral bathrooms to advance these students’ accommodation.
A gender-neutral restroom is a single-stall room that usually bears both the male and the female symbols on the door. To date, 12 USC buildings offer gender-neutral restrooms, yet none are located in a central dormitory location.
The new restroom in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center is a start, but widespread additions are still needed.
USC has been fortunate enough not to have any reported incidents of violence against transsexual students who enter into gender normative restrooms, but violence has been reported in other schools. Documentaries such as Toilet Training outline the discrimination transsexual students face in school settings and uses real stories of transsexuals who have been harassed, beaten or arrested for trying to use the bathroom.
According to a study by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, 500 people reported issues with going to the bathroom in San Francisco alone. This is a real issue that shows real pain and inequality.
Though nothing has happened at USC up to this point, the possibility of violence always exists and the university must take preventative action to keep violence and discrimination from occurring.
Legally speaking, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires at least one solitary restroom for patrons with disabilities in each new building.
Along these same lines, the addition of at least one gender-neutral restroom in each USC building or facility would benefit a wide array of individuals. This includes transgenders, gender non-conforming people or even those who might not feel comfortable using a restroom that classifies them according to gender.
USC has made progress, but it must never settle when there is the possibility for more change. One small step could lead to a variety of benefits; one day we have gender-neutral restrooms, the next we might have gender neutral housing options.
With USC’s inclination to innovate, gender-neutral bathrooms would seem like a small step to a larger movement of advancement.
Above all, the issue calls for empathy among the student body. It’s devastating that such a mundane task such as using the restroom could be potentially dangerous to someone’s physical and mental health.
We often do see the big issue, and in this case, it’s gay rights. But there are still smaller issues affecting groups that go unnoticed. It is time for equality. It is time to deviate from the societal tendency to label a person as male or female and to instead take into consideration that there is a significant population of people who might not identify with either of those gender constructs.
 
Mellissa Linton is a sophomore majoring in English literature. Her counterpoint runs Fridays. 
I join those 500 people reported by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission who had  “issues with going to the bathroom in San Francisco.”  I would wonder what sick, mutilated freak-of-nature was standing or squatting next to me.  These tragic figures and their profound sexual confusion now ask us to join them and confuse the entire society.
I consider myself gender-void.  I do not like to be lumped with transgender people.  Can I have my own bathroom too?
@stanley Harris , i do not agree with this part “or want to change their bodies so that they can pass as heterosexual to avoid homophobia and heterosexism” , do you really think that changing their bodies is less suffering than being gay ? , i really do not know what to say but i will refer you to an episode of “the family guy” the famous cartoon , there is a guy asking his father : father everyone say you are gay ,are you a gay , tell me the truth .
His father: no son i am not gay , you have my word
the guy: oh , thanks god
his father: but i am a woman trapped in a male body and i will go for sex reassignment surgery
the guy : come on dad , just be a gay ! .
The author advocates for more unisex bathrooms for transgender and transsexual students in a way that blurs important definitions and distinctions.
“Transgender” refers to personal gender identity somewhere on the continuum between feminine and masculine, and may or may not be visible to others.  We have all seen actors change their gender-stereotypical behaviors as needed for the characters they portray.  We often modify our behaviour and play roles that help us be successful in diverse social situations, including the use of public restrooms, without sacrificing personal integrity.
“Transsexual” refers to someone who uses attire, hormones and/or surgery to change physical appearance to become congruent with a gender identity that is the opposite of their sex at birth.  They generally want to use the bathroom designated their new sex.
The author contends that “trans” issues are “gay rights” issues. Though transgender and transsexual people’s issues are generally supported by gay, lesbian and bi people; “trans” issues may not always be “gay rights” issues.  “Trans” issues are gender issues, which may differ from sexual orientation issues.  Transgender and transsexual people may be heterosexual, or want to change their bodies so that they can pass as  heterosexual to avoid homophobia and heterosexism.  They may be opposed to gay rights.
The author notes that more students are identifying as trans, without distinquishing whether these students are transgendered or transsexual, or giving the numbers involved.  In addition, what are the sexual orientations, preferences and needs of these students?  What do they want USC to do to be more supportive of their personal and educational development? This complex issue may need more than building additional unisex restrooms.

A recent article in the Daily Trojan reported what many of us already knew: USC is especially welcoming toward members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community when compared with other universities. 
USC’s LGBT Student Resource Center has drawn significantly more students this year, and its establishment in 2005 has helped the university make its way toward the top of the list for LGBT college applicants.
All of this is undoubtedly positive and promising. But one aspect of the LGBT Student Resource Center’s plan is questionable: the push for more gender-neutral restrooms on campus.
Twelve buildings on campus currently have gender-neutral restrooms (a bathroom that bears male and female signs on the door), and many in the LGBT community would like this number to increase.
The community has voiced concern that transgender individuals might feel uncomfortable or be harassed when using single-sex restrooms.
But at a place where an LGBT student is purportedly treated as an equal to any other given student, do we really need to waste time, thought and money on a project that would likely be superfluous?
If we are such a tolerant, integrative university then why are protective measures in restrooms even necessary?
Gender-neutral bathrooms are not the next great step in advancing LGBT rights. Though they would help to make transgender students feel more comfortable, the LGBT center and QuASA should focus their efforts on larger issues affecting the LGBT community.
This isn’t to say gender-neutral bathrooms should not exist at all; rather, 12 of them are enough to serve the campus.
USC students, regardless of his or her personal opinion about LGBT rights, should have the common decency to treat every person with respect, or at the very least not attack a person in the restroom because he or she appears to be transgender.
As a university filled with intelligent people trying to attain higher knowledge and to hopefully make positive contributions to society, it is unlikely that something as basic as who one chooses to have sex with or which gender they identify with would incite such intolerance as to cause an issue with single-sex restrooms. To assume otherwise is almost insulting.
The American Disabilities Act stipulates that buildings make accessible restrooms available, these accessible restrooms often being
gender-neutral.
The new buildings soon to grace our campus are likely to add to the count of gender-neutral bathrooms as a result of the ADA. There is no problem with this. But an attempt to build more gender-neutral restrooms for the purpose of making transgender students feel more accommodated might actually be unnecessary.
Placing such an emphasis on extending congruity to somewhere like the restroom is unnecessary. It draws more attention to the differences that exist among gay, straight and transgender individuals.
Our university has consistently been deemed one of the most LGBT-friendly campuses and our students have repeatedly demonstrated integrity and respect for difference, and it is ludicrous to claim that not offering enough gender-neutral restrooms for transgender students could change or diminish these facts.
The status of our university as one of the most LGBT-friendly should be celebrated. It is more than unfortunate that institutions and individuals still make members of the LGBT community uncomfortable, or even condemn them for their sexual preferences.
We have shown, as a community, that we are not stuck in the dark ages of intolerance toward people of different sexual orientations and have set an example for other institutions for how to make LGBT students feel welcomed.
Throwing money at gender-neutral bathrooms, however, will not make any groundbreaking, positive difference.
 
Sarah Cueva is a sophomore majoring in political science. Her point runs Fridays. 
Is there no end to the whining and the requests for special privileges?  Anybody else out there getting sick of this craziness from the crazies?
I believe that Miss Cueva has painted an excellent picture of how USC SHOULD be, but unfortunately this idealistic picture can be far from the truth. It’s like if I lock my bike up on campus. It SHOULD be there when I get back, right? I mean we go to USC. So there’s no way that anyone would be disrespectful enough to steal from a fellow Trojan. Plus the lock in place should be enough to prevent anything bad from happening. We’re all intelligent to know that stealing bikes is wrong. It’s not like we live in the dark ages where you go raid villages and take what you want. Yet people’s bike still get stolen all the time. And it doesn’t matter if you went weeks, months, or even years at SC without getting your bike stolen because the moment it does happen to you or someone you know, you are going to be concerned about it happening again. So even if we go as far as to say the majority of USC students are tolerant enough to not harass transgender students, it only takes one person, one instance to make someone like Anon question their environment or feel unsafe.
Describing a gender neutral affordance for the school as superfluous due to how LGBT friendly our campus can be compared to saying we don’t need DPS funding because our campus is so safe. Or not passing an equal rights bill because we attended a pride parade. 
The writer is making huge idealistic assumptions without considering that taking steps like including these restrooms on campus are what actually brings us as a community closer to that ideal. We are FAR from having reached that point. The world doesn’t yet run on common decency and awareness, as fabulous as that would be.
Yes, and we should all bake a cake made of rainbows and everyone could share it and peace and happiness would settle across the Earth.
Check your privilege people.
Considering I was just a victim to physical and verbal assault for being transgender by a USC Student, I think the idealistic bubble of wonderful accepting equality that you have portrayed in this article is ENTIRELY invalid.

Clifford Harris Jr., known as T.I. or T.I.P. in the music world, was released from prison Wednesday, a month earlier than scheduled, and will spend the remainder of his sentence in a halfway house in his home state of Georgia.
“The storm is over & da sun back out. IT’S OUR TIME TO SHINE SHAWTY!!!!! Welcome to the beginning of our Happy Ending!!!!” T.I. tweeted shortly after he was released Wednesday morning.
The 30-year-old rapper/actor was sentenced to 11 months in federal prison last October after violating his probation on federal weapons charges.
Hours after T.I. was released, VH1 announced they had signed him to a 10-episode series that will follow his adaptation to life outside of prison and the making of a new album. The series will premiere December 5.
The artist previously did a reality series with MTV, titled “T.I.’s Road To Redemption,” which followed him in the 45 days before his original sentencing in March 2009. Each episode centered around T.I. mentoring a troubled child, as he encouraged them to avoid a life of crime.
“Viewers have always connected with T.I. and we are definitely thrilled to show the next chapter of this incredible artist’s riveting life,” said VH1 original programing chief Jeff Olde.
The Atlanta-based rapper ended up pleading guilty to two felonies — possession of three unregistered machine guns and two silencers, and possession of firearms by a convicted felon.
He finished that sentence in March 2010, but was was arrested on drug charges, along with his wife, six months later in Los Angeles.

President Barack Obama’s jobs speech to Congress will take place next Thursday around 5 p.m. PST, after a public disagreement with House Speaker John Boehner when the president initially scheduled his address Wednesday night.
Wednesday night is the first time that Congress returns to Washington after Labor Day, and is also the slated time slot for a Republican presidential nominee debate. Boehner rejected Obama’s request to address Congress on Wednesday, saying there would not be enough time that night due to logistical and parliamentary concerns.
“With the significant amount of time, typically more than three hours, that is required to allow for a security sweep of the House chamber before receiving a president, it is my recommendation that your address be held on the following evening,” Boehner wrote to the president in a public series of letters about the scheduling conflict.
Obama’s new time slot will now conflict with the NFL opening game at 5:30 p.m. PST, when the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers will go head to head. NBC has said it is working on a resolution with the White House to ensure that the game will go on as scheduled.
In his speech, the president will speak to Congress about his proposal to add jobs and fix the economy as the United States continues to lag in its recovery from the recession.
The Republican party debate is the first time that Texas Gov. Rick Perry will formally face his other presidential opponents since announcing his candidacy in August.

If you’re sick of ordering from TG Express, but still looking for a good pan-Asian restaurant, look no further than Trio House on Figueroa and 30th streets. Though the nondescript appearance of this restaurant might mean you’ve never noticed it while walking to the 901 Bar & Grill or down to Taco Bell, once you’ve found it, you won’t be disappointed.

Guests are greeted with prompt service and a massive menu, which spans six pages and includes a wall-mounted boba and milk tea service.
Every time I’ve dined here, the staff has been polite and attentive; they bring waters to the table before taking beverage orders and are always willing to explain menu items or check with the kitchen on the availability of rare dishes. Though the interior of the restaurant is a bit shabby, the food certainly makes up for it.

Every course at Trio House is a delight, with appetizers ranging from fresh spring rolls with rice noodles, shrimp and julienned vegetables to delectable Japanese gyoza, served with a traditional potsticker dipping sauce.

Because of the expansive menu, making an entrée choice is difficult; however, it’s hard to go wrong with one of the various fried rice dishes or the drunken noodle (if you’re not a fan of spice, make sure to ask for mild — this one can be a mouth burner).
In addition to rice and noodle dishes, Trio House serves up a number of soup dishes, some mainstream and some more adventurous. The vegetable udon comes in a huge steaming bowl, complete with steamed tofu and a generous serving of tempura vegetables.
To complement their plethora of entrée options, Trio House also boasts a small but delicious dessert menu: fried banana served a la mode, banana brulee, and a variety of Asian-inspired ice cream flavors such as Thai tea, green tea and coconut.

In addition to dine-in and take-out, Trio House also boasts a delivery service. The phone number is (213) 741-0101, and www.triohouse.com offers an online ordering option as well. All entrees, with the exclusion of specials, are less than $10, with beverages less than $5.

Fall will soon be poking its head around the corner and it’s practically mandatory that it arrives with new TV series in tow. For those of you curious about the upcoming Fox series, New Girl, and don’t mind the most inoffensive of spoilers, read on.
With Zooey Deschanel as the star and a tagline reading “Simply adorkable,” New Girl holds promise as a quirky show sure to entertain fans of awkward characters and situations. Deschanel plays Jess, a young woman who, after a painful breakup, decides she needs a change of life’s scenery.
The show follows her relationships with her three new male roommates, Nick (Jake M. Johnson), Schmidt (Max Greenfield) and Coach (Damon Wayans, Jr.), as well as her best friend, Cece (Hannah Simone).
Sadly, the first episode did not live up to the expectations the trailer had established. From the beginning, the scenes are confusing. Flashbacks advance too quickly for the jokes to sink in.
When we finally settle in present time, Jess’ emotional breakdown is barely believable. Her obsession with Dirty Dancing has good intentions as a method of breakup recovery, but Deschanel’s sobbing fails to elicit sympathy, even if it was intended to be comically overdone.
Adding to the disappointment, the dynamics between Jess and her new roommates and Cece feel forced and unrealistic. We can usually suspend disbelief for anything filmed for the entertainment of the general public, but opposites do not attract with Jess’ social awkwardness and Cece’s occupation as a model. Though Cece treats Jess with admirable kindness, their relationship lacks the chemistry necessary for a TV friendship to be taken seriously.
If there’s any reason to watch New Girl, it’ll be for the unfailing hilarity of the trio, Nick, Schmidt and Coach. Together, they outshine Deschanel and take the reins of the show. Nick’s reaction to a not-so-recent breakup highlights his dramatized sensitivity; Schmidt’s regular offenses of douchebaggery make us want to create our own “Douchebag Jar”; Coach gets a laugh with every emotionally-blind “Stop it!” directed at Jess.

USC secondary coach Willie Mack Garza has resigned, citing personal issues, the school announced Thursday.
“I stepped down today from my coaching duties at USC,” Garza said in a statement. “I have some personal issues unrelated to USC that I need to address. I wish the Trojans the best and I am sorry I won’t be with them in what I know will be a very successful season.”
Garza was not at USC’s mid-morning practice earlier Thursday, while it is in the midst of final preparations for Saturday’s season opener against Minnesota.
Serving as the defensive backs coach at Tennessee during the 2009 season, Garza arrived at USC along with coach Lane Kiffin, who accepted the position in January 2010.
Former USC safety Sammy Knight, who played in the NFL for 12 seasons and has been on staff as graduate assistant, is expected to replace Garza on an interim basis.
