Christie Bertch is a senior majoring in broadcast journalism and sociology with a minor in business law. She will graduate in May.
So will her father, Dr. Steven Bertch, who will graduate with an executive master of business administration from the Marshall School of Business on the same day. He also graduated as a Doctor of Dental Surgery in 1984.

But the family connection doesn’t end there.
Steven’s wife, Kathleen, also graduated from the dental program in 1983. She completed her undergraduate studies at USC, and she’s now a dental hygienist at the USC Oral Health Center.
And to top it off, their son, Michael, is headed to USC in the fall.
With two graduating, one soon to be enrolled and another working at USC, the Bertch family’s tight Trojan bond is unique.
“Even the trustees and admissions people haven’t heard of anything like this,” Steven said.
Steven and Kathleen met at USC in a parking lot during the 1984 Olympics. Within six months, they were engaged, and within another year, they were married. Three years later, their first child, Christie, was born.
“I’ve been a Trojan since I can remember,” Christie said. “Everyone jokes I was here before I was born.”
Christie and her brother have been surrounded by the Trojan lifestyle their entire lives.
Michael said his USC experience really started when he was six and came to his first USC football game against Oregon State in 1997.
“Ever since then, I’ve been to nearly every home game — win or lose, rain or shine,” Michael said. “It is now 2010, and I’m looking forward to continuing the tradition as a student.”
Christie said having her whole family at USC has turned what would be an individual experience into a more meaningful family affair.
“It’s been a dream for me to be able to share my passion for USC with my family,” Christie said.
“We’re all so passionate about USC,” Kathleen said. “There is something to be said about the Trojan Family and Trojan Family traditions. There’s nothing like the USC experience.”
Christie said it was exactly this sentiment that made her want to follow in her parents’ footsteps and attend USC.
“You just feel passionate about what USC means around the world and what it means in Los Angeles,” she said. “I felt an immediate connection, and that’s really what made me want to come here.”
Both Christie and Michael said they never really considered going anywhere else for college — neither did their father when he decided to pursue a business education to fulfill his dream of being an entrepreneur
“I want to have an effect in the industry and make a difference,” he said. “Our country needs innovation.”
Steven noted that he never expected his return to USC to include his entire family.
“Never in my wildest imagination would I ever have thought we’d all be here like this,” Steven said.
Steven said he was amazed by the odds of his and his daughter’s graduating from the same school in the same year. Christie, however, said that with her family’s tight bond, it almost made sense.
“We’ve always been a close family,” Christie said.
Her father agreed.
“Their whole lives, we’ve been away from them 10 days total,” Steven said. “It’s natural that we’re sharing the school like this.”
Still, the Bertches said that although they’re close, being busy keeps them from being together constantly.
“I work eight hours a day,” Kathleen said. “Christie comes to me when she needs something. We’re all so busy in our own little worlds of what we do day to day. When time allows, we meet up, but we all have our own lives.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Steven Bertch graduated from USC’s dental hygiene program. Bertch actually graduated USC with a Doctor of Dental Surgery.
I shared a class with Christie and she always seemed happy and so full of school spirit that I expected her to bust out some School cheers at any moment; now I know why. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that she was baptized in the Queens Court Fountain, or  has a tattoo Ol’ George Tirebitter on her lower back. She is THAT hardcore.
oh my gosh what an interesting and insightful report.

The budget the Undergraduate Student Government senators will vote on tonight is about $25,000 different from one proposed last week.
When USG officers drew up their proposed budget for next year, they operated under the assumption that they’d be receiving $86,000 from the carry-over account — money left over from the administration from two years ago.
Instead, USG was informed last week that it would only be receiving $61,000, forcing the Allocations Committee to shave $25,000 from the budget, according to USG Treasurer Brian Anderson.
As usual, a university-hired accountant was tasked with calculating how much money USG would receive from the carry-over fund. The Allocations Committee had requested the information a week before the budget was due, but they did not hear back until the morning of the day the budget was presented to the Senate. Because they did not have time to account for the changes, USG officers chose to present their original budget but explain the circumstances.
“We knew that we could present the budget, explain it to the senators and then, once changes were made, present it later on,” Anderson said. “We told the senators Tuesday morning that it would be changed.”
The budget USG had hoped to enact made many adjustments to the previous administration’s budget.
Senate allocations, money that senators use for their projects, was decreased 54 percent in USG’s proposed budget, falling from $22,620.13 last year to $10,497.70. This decrease was planned because President Chris Cheng and Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen thought the money would be better spent in other places.
Another area that was also set to decrease was the administration portion of Program Board. Because Program Board and the Executive Cabinet will be sharing an office next year, and as such can share equipment and administrative expenses, 14 percent of last year’s Program Board Administration funding would have been transferred to the Executive Cabinet Administration.
The development portion of Executive Cabinet allocations, which is used for retreats and dinners with administrators, would also have received an 8 percent decrease from the old budget. 
“Now that we have the new campus center, we’ll be able to hold Campus Partners dinners there, again, saving money,” Cheng said.
Though the proposed budget showed a 30 percent increase in funding for legal services, the costs are actually the same as they were in last year’s budget — the apparent change is the result of a reporting error by USG.
“We found that the legal services was a valuable resource to students,” Cheng said. “Last year, it was reported wrong and never corrected.”
The executive/legislative portion of the Executive Cabinet allocations would have seen an 11 percent increase under the proposed budget. Cheng and Ogbevoen had planned this raise because they wanted to give the various directors more money for advocacy projects.
Public Relations, on the other hand, was slated for a 14 percent decrease. 
“They had a lot of money left over this year,” Cheng said. “We want to focus more on manpower instead of buying a lot of gear … We decided to reallocate it where it could be better used.”
Under Funding Board allocations, the proposed budget also included a 2 percent increase for the Discretionary Funding Board, which is the body in charge of distributing money to student groups.
“This money goes directly back to students,” Cheng said. “It’s a straight avenue for student organizations to apply for and use for their own events.”
There also would have been several changes to Program Board, such as a 25 percent increase for the Performing Arts Committee and a 6 percent increase for the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Assembly.
USG had proposed these changes in hopes of making things run more efficiently and effectively. But without the extra $25,000 the officers believed they would receive, USG will be forced to strike these changes from the budget and revert to the last administration’s budget.
There is still hope, however.
USG is waiting to hear whether the Board of Trustees will approve its proposed $1 increase to the Student Programming fee. If it is approved, USG will receive $30,000 dollars, which will more than compensate for the $25,000 cut. This decision, however, will not be made until the summer.
“Right now, we’re operating on the budget with the money from the carry-over account,” Anderson said. “This will allow USG and Program Board to start planning their year and all the programming they want to do.”
Even if they are forced to use the old budget, Ogbevoen said he doesn’t think it will be a problem.
“USG and Program Board have consistently done a good job,” Ogbevoen said. “We really are excited that we have a new team, new energy, new passion, new ideas, and even with this budget, we will still be able to do all the great activities, performances and fund student organizations like we’ve always done.”

Here’s a band with respect for its musical elders, playing sincere pop rock with a steadfast dedication to freak-folk delivery and a pleasant penchant for irony.
Thus far, the band described is of a pretty standard garage band ilk these days. So what sets Avi Buffalo apart?
Strong start · Recorded with support from indie super-label Sub Pop Records, Long Beach’s Avi Buffalo’s debut release is available today. - Photo courtesy of Sub Pop Records 
For starters, its song “Summer Cum” is potentially the catchiest song ever written on the titular subject. And although the similarly infectious runner-up for that distinction “Relax” left the group Frankie Goes To Hollywood wallowing in one-hit wonderdom, this track’s rambling whine, jangly guitars and steady drums transcend the charm to expose an unexpected musical maturity.
From the superb opening lines — I’ve waited for your love / I got lost in your summer cum / Leave all your stains with me / and know that I will never be — to the warped analog tape sounds that cap the track, “Summer Cum” is an absolutely delightful pop song, and, for the most part, it revels in like company on the album.
The self-titled album, the group’s first release on indie label behemoth Sub Pop, is really its first release ever. The bandmates sold CDs at shows in their hometown of Long Beach, Calif. and during a residency at the Echo, but Sub Pop inked this foursome without seeing a release with packaging, artwork or very many songs.
Noting the obvious potential of the fledgling group’s small but potent body of work, the influential label released “What’s It In For?” as the band’s debut single in December and made certain this self-titled affair would be available for early summer mixtapes.
That single demonstrates not only an astonishing musicality and grasp of pop structure, but it’s simply a good time. And it’s not without obvious prowess — the band simultaneously comes off as professional and musically loose.
Mixing business and pleasure must come easy to the group’s lead singer, guitarist and principal songwriter Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg. The writer is genius, tossing out songs of heartbroken torment and teenage misery with the blasé fluidity of someone writing a poem about his puppy.
Rebecca Coleman’s shimmering keys and lighthearted backup vocals lay a beautiful sheen over Avi’s pained lyrics and tortured Johnny Marr-style guitar. Bassist Arin Fazio and drummer Sheridan Riley keep the whole show zigzagging forward, nicely centering the polarized styles of Avi and Rebecca.
What sets Avi Buffalo apart is the same thing that sets all great bands apart: When these four gifted musicians bring their disparate talents together, the resultant sounds are magnificent, preternatural and truthful.
“Remember Last Time” is a fully realized example of this beautiful cohesion. The track follows two sleepy folk gems and is a layered masterpiece that brings childish energy to the up-tempo Neil Young delivery. Even at more than seven minutes long, the begging, desperate love letter is a rousing track with more to discover on each listen.
The discovery and newness that carry through repeated listenings seem to answer Avi’s question to the object of his desperation: How did I really last? How soon / were you sick of me too?
Unfortunately, the cohesive perfection achieved on some songs makes those tracks that narrowly miss flawlessness all the more frustrating.
“Where’s Your Dirty Mind,” for instance, is clever and touching but exasperatingly incomplete. The first section shows potential, but its sparseness nervously inculcates a feeling that this song might not reach its emotional peak. Indeed, when the guitar solo comes in sans Rebecca’s pounding keys and with little input from Fazio or Riley, the music is — for the first time on the album — boring. It isn’t a bad song; it’s a great song that wasn’t done just right. Performed live, with all the elements of the band blended with the intelligent, droll lyrics, this song could be among the band’s best.
Without prior releases to compare, it is often easier to give magnanimous praise to a group’s debut album. The thought of subsequent Avi Buffalo albums certainly sounds exciting, and though this album will be a point of comparison, it’s not a mere stepping-stone for the group. A few albums into its future, referring to this as a “promising debut” will be gratuitous and laughable.
This debut is a great album in its own right. And barring any unforeseen setbacks, it will be one of many great albums from a group that has already fulfilled its promise and burst into the collective music consciousness as a great band.
What sets Avi Buffalo apart is that it has already established its talent, accessibility and passion for the craft. The only thing that’s left is the success that’s sure to follow.

The formation of underground music scenes is hardly a novel concept.
In the United States, music countercultures have always flourished when political tensions peak and carbon copies of a particular sonic trend flood the airwaves.
The rock subgenre of punk pierced the flower-child movement as early as 1967 with harder-edged groups like the Stooges and further retaliated against mass-produced arena rock in the mid-1970s with the Ramones, Sex Pistols and Patti Smith.
Later in the early 1980s, hardcore raged in a time during which intensely hook-driven pop music reigned. Though these countercultures came to define generations, their origins mainly rested in the simple rejection of the popular musical aesthetic.
But imagine if the act of creating, playing and producing any form of music that deviated from “non-traditional” — whether rock or rap, pop or blues — was forbidden and punishable by the national government. The underground, then, would be not just a rejection of a prevailing aesthetic or a repulsion of the mainstream but also truly underground — secretive, risky and, at times, life-threatening.
This is neither Footloose nor is it fodder for history textbooks. The place is Tehran, and the time is now.
In No One Knows About Persian Cats, award-winning Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi explores Tehran’s hidden yet electrifying sonic underground using actual musicians and figureheads from the thriving indie-rock scene.
Ghobadi co-wrote the screenplay with his girlfriend, American-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi, who was imprisoned last year by the Iranian government on espionage charges.
A loosely scripted narrative that has been falsely designated a rock documentary on Internet sites and message boards, No One Knows About Persian Cats follows real-life Iranian indie-rock power couple Ashkan Koshanejad and Negar Shaghaghi (whose dark synth-pop outfit goes by the name of Take It Easy Hospital) as they struggle to assemble a band, procure passports and visas to tour in Europe, and obtain a permit to perform a concert in their homeland as one last hurrah.
Akin to Gillo Pontecorvo’s stark realism in the visually political tour-de-force The Battle of Algiers (1966), No One Knows About Persian Cats is a slow-burning yet riveting model of cinema verite in its finest form. Shot in only 18 days on a hand-held digital camera and without a permit from the government — a requirement for all films produced in Iran — Ghobadi delves into stories lurking beneath Tehran’s crowded streets and uncovers makeshift recording studios, rehearsal spaces and concert venues where Iranian musicians line the walls with blankets and jam freely — or as freely as they can with one keen eye always on the lookout.
In present-day Iran, striking a chord on an electric guitar is considered a crime, one that has sent countless numbers of musicians, young and old, to prison. The only sound permitted in night clubs or on the radio is traditional Persian music, a legal holdover from the Islamic Revolution, the regime change that radically transformed Iran from one of the most Westernized nations in the Middle East to a state regulated by strict Islamic law. Every remnant of Iran’s Western past was tossed across nation lines — including rock ‘n’ roll.
To attain a permit to perform as a band, musicians must have their demos approved by the government. Rock groups that practice in their homes are reported to the police. Even traditional Persian music is illegal if it’s performed by a woman — women are not allowed to perform solo but only as backing vocalists for a band, so guitar and piano-wielding songstresses inspired by the Western likes of Joni Mitchell, Tori Amos and Norah Jones are swiftly blacklisted.
According to a recent article in The Washington Post, Ghobadi said that “more than 90 percent of artistic production in Iran is created underground.” What has formed from this, however, is a kind of indie rock unfamiliar to Americans, one that is not a generic definition for anything that is neither on American Idol nor on the Vans Warped Tour but an all-encompassing term for any band brave enough to play within Tehran’s walls yet outside the Islamic regime’s rules.
Despite their varying backgrounds and musical tastes, these artists — many of whom contend they’re not outwardly political — have become unintentional activists, as their music unifies a disconnected city and revives a culture beaten and bruised by oppressors.
And it is this power of music — the ability to form a collective conscience that is both artistic and socially aware — that ties the Iranian underground together.
“I just want a place to sing,” Negar begs in the film, a sentiment that is immediately reciprocated by her fellow musicians.
But what’s most intriguing about No One Knows About Persian Cats is the film’s journey thus far. After the movie premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a Special Jury Prize, and continued its rounds on the world festival circuit — it picked up an award for best foreign film at the São Paulo International Film Festival — Ghobadi almost immediately felt the weight of the consequences for creating the film. As it continues to open in theaters across the globe, Ghobadi is increasingly seen as a criminal in the eyes of the Iranian government and acknowledges that he has become an exile from his homeland.
In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Ghobadi described his current fragile situation: “Either they will throw me in jail, or, if they’re very polite to me, they will put me under house arrest and they will seize my passport because I have made this movie and I am doing this interview with you.”
And even though many of the bands featured in the film have fled to perform elsewhere — Take It Easy Hospital is currently based in London, while Joy Division-inspired outfit Yellow Dogs recently played several shows in Brooklyn — their notes from the underground continue to resound in their lively yet introspective music.
“Your lyrics are always so dark,” Ashkan says to Negar in the film after she shows him her latest scrawls of inspiration in her notebook. “Did you write them in prison?”
Although these lines are scripted, the sad thing is they are mere breaths away from the truth.

The first thing you noticed when walking into Downtown Los Angeles’ renovated Million Dollar Theater for Friday night’s performance of NEW. was exactly that — you walked right in.
Newocracy · NEW. is an experimental rock opera written by Rachel Kolar (bottom right) and stars Kolar and Lauren Brown (bottom left) as neon-clad debutantes. Musician/filmmaker Ariana Delawari also stars. - Photos courtesy of Enjoy Press 
While two friendly-looking helpers handed out programs and a private security guard smiled, attendees coming through the art deco theater’s front door were not asked to present a ticket, show I.D. or have their bags searched. Instead, the event was free and guests were under no scrutiny for their intentions or age.
In today’s trustless world of rules and regulations, such simple freedom was a liberating preparation for things to come.
NEW. is an experimental rock opera written by playwright and actress Rachel Kolar, one half of “avant hard” theater company Post Fact Productions. Along with fellow New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts graduate Lauren Brown, Kolar blurs the lines between musical and visual art by putting it into a theatrical setting. The concept brings art out of the mainstream and forces audiences to question the intersections of self expression.
Unlike traditional rock operas where songs and scenes are explored by one musician or band — such as Pink Floyd’s The Wall or Green Day’s American Idiot — NEW. was envisioned as an evolving collaboration between Los Angeles’ Eastside’s most creative minds.
The play follows two fluorescent-draped debutantes who seek power and synthetic meaning in a trash-covered post-apocalyptic stagescape. In their quest for dominance over the plebeian “zonnies,” the girls murder the in-place dictator, attempt to inject fun and neon into the masses, blow up the world and navigate the post-everything, classical-element themed nothingness.
Originally performed as a dark comedy at a Silver Lake theater in 2008, NEW. kept its plot but transformed its purpose, aesthetics and soundtrack to create an entirely different experience.
In addition to replacing songs and onstage appearances from local experimental bands Hecuba and Rainbow Arabia with a dream team of equally-as-out-there Echo Park artists, Kolar and Brown also booked a 2,500-seat theater and convinced The Standard hotel and several city-endorsed Downtown Los Angeles revitalization programs to sponsor the event so it could be free.
The resulting performances, titled “Free Art For The People,” were promoted through a corresponding online petition that explained Post Fact’s vision of providing jobs for artists while ensuring free public art and also laid out plans for conducting similar no-cost-to-the-people cultural celebrations in cities across the country.
Though Post Fact’s attempt at organizing a free collaborative play might seem like an idealistic dream on paper, Kolar and Brown succeeded in incorporating emerging local artists in every facet of the production.
The show begins with performance artist Oliwa emerging from a seat in the audience, climbing onstage, tearing off his straggly clothes and dancing to dissonant tribal sounds he composed wearing skintight gold lamé pants.
In the next scene, we are then introduced to Lauren and Rachel — played by Brown and Kolar — the neon green- and pink-adorned socialites who spend their time scowling at the trash-covered world below.
Multimedia artist and composer Anna Oxygen appears as the bleak world’s authoritarian leader, singing her original songs “This Is An Exercise” and “Dictator Jam,” both of which feature heavy breathing and a military-reminiscent bass.
Adorably uplifting freak-folk musician Amanda Jo Williams teamed up with singer-songwriter Featherbeard to perform a duet of sorts as the king and queen of the ocean. Wearing a lobster outfit made of lace and orange-red plush, Williams’ Joanna Newsom-on-helium vocals floated over her signature children’s-guitar strumming while merman-clad Featherbeard’s “Happenis Heer” drifted around like the scene’s three fish-costumed dancers.
Other onstage appearances included musician-filmmaker Ariana Delawari in a rare dance performance as the personification of air and the L.A. Ladies Choir, who in the final moments of the play glided down the aisles in vintage off-white wedding gowns while holding a single sustained note.
The multitude of talent behind NEW. is enough to carry the rock opera into the conceptual record books, but the visually stimulating result warrants even more praise.
With snarky, satirical dialogue and not-so-subtle escalating tension between the two lead characters, the constantly posturing Lauren and Rachel have an alluring dynamic reminiscent of members of the Mean Girls clique, The Plastics.
Adding to that is their elaborately textured costumes — crafted by fashion designer Miss KK — and neon beehive wigs which evoked Victorian-era nobility and created the focal point of the play’s high-contrast color dichotomy.
And though they had no speaking lines, NEW.’s three atmospheric dancers were crucial in setting up each scene. Using movement and costume add-ons, they trudged, danced and swirled around each new character, creating realistic ambience for the various land, sea and air environments.
While the city continues its various efforts to revitalize Downtown as a cultural hub, Post Fact Productions is taking an active role to ensure Los Angeles’ unique artistic voice is heard.
And by rallying the efforts of Eastside’s free-thinking underground around an accessible yet thought-provoking script, Kolar and Brown were able to garner the support to complete their cultural experiment and make the revamped NEW. cost-free to the masses.

The USC baseball team will try to continue its midweek success this season.
The Trojans are 7-1 this season during weekday games, punctuated by last Tuesday’s nine-run comeback win over the final four innings against the same UC Santa Barbara squad they’ll face today.
Sputtering · Senior catcher Keith Castillo and the Trojans have lost eight of their last 10 games and are struggling to stay alive in the Pac-10. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
However, today, the Trojans (17-22, 3-12) will have to deal with a limited skeletal squad when they travel to take on the Gauchos (17-17) at 2 p.m.
College baseball depth is often an issue, and USC has not been immune this season.
Scholarships are limited in college baseball. Injuries can quickly thin the depth chart. But with the largest playing schedule in college athletics, baseball teams are also affected by class schedules.
Class conflicts will force USC to leave an hour later than originally planned and have caused some changes in the starting lineup.
“We’ve got some guys that are ailing and guys that have to attend class,” USC coach Chad Kreuter said. “I want to make a lineup out, but we’ve got guys beat up, so I have to wait to see. It will be very interesting.”
Kreuter planned to start pitcher Chad Smith but had to scratch the right-handed sophomore because Smith does not get out of class until 1:50 p.m. Instead of Smith, the start will likely go to junior Logan Odom, depending on how Odom’s arm feels today after he pitched in two of the three games against Oregon.
“Logan deserves a shot after the way he threw this weekend,” Kreuter said.
Kreuter said he had already planned to use multiple pitchers much like he has during the last four midweek games. In those contests, USC has used an average of five pitchers per game.
USC has won all four of those games but only by a combined five runs. Kreuter attributes the close games to the team’s inability to string together hits.
“We’ve scuffled a bit at the plate,” Kreuter said. “We’re hitting. It’s just at different times. The hits aren’t necessarily coming together. We’ve needed a clutch hit here or there and haven’t been able to do it.”
With only four upperclassman position players, a lot of the pressure hitting situations have come with young freshmen and sophomores at the plate. The coaching staff has been trying to repeatedly simulate these situations every day in practice.
“If you make it routine, it becomes easier because then it becomes automatic,” Kreuter said. “It’s something that comes with experience, and right now we’re in the middle of some growing pains.”
Kreuter blamed the inconsistency and inexperience of his young lineup for the team’s struggles, as the Trojans have gone 4-10 in the month of April. But he remained optimistic the team is capable of going on a strong run over the final 21 games of the season, beginning with today’s game.
“The Pac-10 is so strong this season,” he said. “If you get in the middle of the pack, with a solid non-conference record, you are going to likely get a call from the [NCAA] regional committee.”

Split between two events this weekend, the USC track and field team still managed to capture 11 combined titles at the Tiny Lister and UC San Diego invitationals.
Leader of the pack · Junior distance runner David Branch captured one of the Trojans’ 11 titles last weekend when he ran his season-best time of 3:57.06 in the 1,500-meter event at the Tiny Lister Invitational. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
Two Trojans captured hammer throw events at both invitationals this weekend — redshirt sophomore Marissa Minderler at Tiny Lister and junior Trey Henderson at UCSD.
Minderler’s winning throw of 193 feet, one inch was good enough to move her into eighth place on the all-time hammer throw list at USC.
Henderson’s throw of 216 feet, eight inches edged out Guatemala’s Raul Rivera’s toss by more than five feet to capture the title in San Diego.
Senior Ekene Anene captured two jumping titles at Tiny Lister, clearing a career best of five feet, five inches in the high jump and a season-best 40-foot leap in the triple jump.
Showing more overall strength, senior Brandon Estrada also took the Tiny Lister title in pole vault with a height of 17 feet, 6.5 inches.
The track events were equally successful for USC, as senior Myra Hasson took first in the 400-meter sprint at 55.10 seconds and freshman Alexis Brown placing 12th with her season-best time of 59.23.
Among the winners on the men’s side of the track were senior Jason Price’s season-best 47.79 winning time in the 400-meter and junior David Branch’s season-best time of 3:57.06 in the 1,500-meter.
Junior Brendan Ames continued his strong hurdling season with another victory at Tiny Lister, running a 13.91 in the 110-meter hurdles. Freshman Reggie Wyatt won the 400-meter hurdles in 51.58, despite running more than a second slower than his 400-meter sprint last week, which was his season-best effort.
Redshirt sophomore Amechi Egbe was able to set a season best at the Tiny Lister, running the 100-meter dash in a wind-aided 10.67.
The Trojans will next take part in their all-important USC-UCLA dual meet on May 1 before Pac-10 conference events begin the following week.
Last season, the Trojans topped the Bruins in convincing fashion at their dual meet, sweeping UCLA. The sweep was the first time USC beat both UCLA’s men’s and women’s squads since the women began competing in 1984.
The victory in last year’s edition also clinched the Gauntlet Trophy — the all-sport competition between UCLA and USC — for the Trojans.

Forget about how poorly the USC baseball team (17-22, 3-12) is playing.
Forget about Pete Carroll not drafting Taylor Mays.
And forget about the men’s volleyball team dropping its quarterfinals match to Cal State Northridge.
There is something that every Trojan can rejoice about after a highly disappointing weekend of sports.
The USC men’s tennis team.
Though the team might not be getting the same attention as baseball, football or volleyball this spring, the men’s tennis players should be earning more praise than any team just mentioned above.
Why?
Well, unlike the baseball team, the tennis team actually wins matches, both in and out of conference.
Unlike football, tennis is actually an in-season spring sport.
And unlike the men’s volleyball team, USC tennis players were actually successful in postseason play.
It may have been hidden under the cloud of negativity encompassing USC sports last weekend, but senior tennis player Robert Farah swept both the Pac-10 singles championship and, along with sophomore Steve Johnson, the Pac-10 doubles championship Sunday in Ojai, Calif.
Freshman J.T. Sundling also captured the freshman Pac-10 Invitational singles title.
Farah got things started Sunday with a sweep against defending singles champion Bradley Klahn of Stanford 6-2, 7-6 (5) to earn his first Pac-10 singles championship.
But the USC veteran wasn’t done.
Fourth-seeded UCLA was waiting for the senior and Johnson in the doubles championship, but the Trojans dismantled their crosstown rival 6-3, 7-6 (4), giving Farah his second crown of the day.
Added to Sundling’s success in the freshman invitational, the tennis team captured the Anson S. Thacher Cup, awarded annually to the top team performance in the Pac-10 tennis championships.
See Trojan nation, there was something to appreciate over the weekend. You probably just didn’t see, hear or read about it.
I’ve seen this argument in so many Daily Trojan sports columns in the last four years, but teams like this should be getting more attention from the USC community.
Often, it seems as though if it’s not football, basketball or baseball, a lot of people just don’t care. This university is lucky to have so many top-notch athletes and dominating programs; it’s a shame that their efforts go under the radar.
I urge everyone out there to give these programs the attention they deserve.
Farah, Johnson, Sundling and the rest of the tennis team: I applaud you. And for all the other teams hidden beneath more dominating headlines, the same goes for you.
With less recognition, you
continue to fill USC with sports programs that the rest of the  Pac-10 fears and respects.
Now, in my last few paragraphs before officially signing off, I want to recognize the other guys that go through the weekly column grind with me.
Pedro, Kenny, Grant, Schwartz and James, I take just as much enjoyment in reading your columns as I do in writing mine. Only you guys know the process we go through on a weekly basis, and I think, as a whole, we made our own great sports team.
I also want to thank all of you readers, of course.
As Grant pointed out last week, it’s not about whether you agree or disagree with what I’m writing, it’s about whether you take the time to read it.
In my first three years at USC, whenever I’d pick up a Daily Trojan, I’d be sure to read the sports column first. It was always the most interesting part of the paper to me. 
I couldn’t be happier that I got the chance to be a part of that my senior year, and I hope many of you readers found the columns on the back page just as creative and enticing as I did.
Personally, I can’t thank you
enough for reading my input.
But all good things must come to an end.
So, this marks the last time you’ll see my name in the Daily Trojan, the last time you’ll get to stare at my goofy picture and the last time you’ll get to question my column name.
Fight on and read on everyone.

The No. 5 USC men’s tennis team built upon its regular season Pac-10 title by capturing the Pac-10 championship team title along with three individual championships last weekend in Ojai, Calif.
Champ · Senior Robert Farah won both the singles and doubles titles at the Pac-10 championships. Former Trojan Kaes Van’t Hof achieved the same feat in 2008. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
Senior Robert Farah led the way by capturing both the Pac-10 singles championship and Pac-10 doubles championship with partner sophomore Steve Johnson.
Farah followed in the footsteps of former doubles partner Kaes Van’t Hof, who won both the singles and doubles titles in 2008.
“It’s a great achievement,” Farah said. “I was working for that; it was the ultimate goal. It feels awesome to do whatever Kaes did, and now I feel ready to play in the NCAAs.”
In the doubles bracket, top-seeded Farah and Johnson triumphed over fourth-seeded Amit Inbar and Nick Meister of UCLA in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (4).
The win helped Johnson overcome a personal barrier in the tournament and extended his winning streak when paired with Farah to 12.
“Definitely enjoyable,” Johnson said. “I have lost twice in the final before. It feels good to finally get a win at Ojai.”
Earlier in the day, top-seeded Farah defeated second-seeded Stanford Bradley Klahn 6-2, 7-6 (5) to capture the singles crown — his third singles victory over Klahn this season.
As the top seed in the invitational bracket, Sundling stuck to the script and won 7-5, 7-6 over UCLA’s Alex Brigham.
Sundling became the second straight Trojan to take the invitational singles crown after sophomore Daniel Nguyen achieved the feat last year.
The top seeds were not the only Trojans to play well throughout the weekend.
Four singles players and three doubles teams participated in respective championship brackets as well as four singles and two doubles inclusions in the invitational bracket.
Apart from the champions, Nguyen and junior Peter Lucassen performed impressively in the competition’s top flight.
“Nguyen was a couple of points away from a big win,” USC coach Peter Smith said of Nguyen’s three-set loss to Klahn in the semifinals.
Lucassen dominated his two matches during the first day of play, including a win 6-1, 6-1 over sixth-seeded junior Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan of Washington.
“Peter did have a good day, and this tournament is perfect for someone like Peter where he can get a little more comfortable of the tennis court and gain some confidence,” Smith said.
In his following match, Lucassen fell short to Klahn but had the opportunity to build positive momentum following a tough stretch toward the end of the season.
In another positive development, sophomore Matt Kecki returned to the courts for the first time since March 3, but he fell short 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 to Martin Kildahl of Washington.
“Good to see Kecki back on the courts,” Smith said. “He had some flashes of great tennis but wasn’t fit enough to finish the match.”
USC players said they are using this tournament as a building block for the upcoming NCAA championships and beyond.
“I’m taking the tournament seriously this year,” Farah said. “Not that I did not take it seriously the last couple of years, but since I will be turning pro in June, these are the tournaments where I need to measure myself against the competition.”
Planning for this tournament often relies on a delicate balance between resting players and having others participate to make sure the team is in top shape when the NCAA championships commence in mid-May.
Johnson, junior Jaak Poldma, and senior Jason McNaughton took a break from singles play last weekend, but other regular contributors gained confidence in hopes of another championship run.
“A couple of players were able to build momentum for the NCAAs,” Smith said. “That’s what we’re here for.”

As college students, we have a tendency to get bored. Really bored.
But you can’t blame us — our society today suffers from a hyperactive attention span, which has become problematic to say the least.
Just take a look at the present state of popular culture.
Audiences fixate on the latest thing in entertainment one day only to drop it the next. Ironically, however, the public’s rabid A.D.D. has done nothing to motivate industry leaders and entertainers to step up and foster originality.
In the past half century, new platforms like video games and the Internet have mildly held our attention, while music, film and other conventional forms of entertainment culture have witnessed a steady decline in innovation. Sadly, the advent of technology in the past decade has done little to alleviate America’s hysterical boredom.
The entertainment industry as we know it seems to have taken a turn toward flash in the pan trends with no foreseeable cure in sight. Desperate corporations have pulled out all the stops, producing anything remotely gimmicky or flashy in their attempt to temporarily hold ratings and make a quick buck on a sub-par idea.
Case in point: MTV’s The Hills franchise — the part-reality, part-scripted account of beautiful 20-somethings living in Los Angeles — has garnered millions of viewers during five choppy seasons. Like many of the network’s shows, what it lacks in genius, it makes up in distraction factor.
The fierce explosion of reality programming has been marked by a heavy reliance on controversy, catfights and human degradation to divert our attention. If programs like the indulgent Flavor of Love and its countless spin-offs are any indication, this strategy is working.
As a consequence though, substantive talent has been replaced with a superficial shine ready to burn out in 15 minutes or less.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Surprisingly, consumers are buying into it — for now. Although nothing seems to amuse us anymore, college students can actually be a much-needed change of direction.
At USC and other college campuses across the country, there is a glimmer of hope. Singers, actors, dancers and entertainers populate the college environment, creating what could soon be a refreshing breath of talent.
Hip-hop and break dancers from competing teams like Chaotic 3 and Break Through, vocalists from a capella groups like Reverse Osmosis and SoCal Vocals, and performers from the USC’s School of Theatre and the Thornton School of Music follow eagerly in the pursuit of quality entertainment.
Collegiate organizations, which are committed to developing the arts in areas such as music, film and more, offer an organic level of training much different from the corporate practice of churning out recycled ideas.
Students perform at open mic nights at Ground Zero Café, compete in dance competitions throughout Los Angeles, create movies and upload their musical repertoires on YouTube. With USC’s thriving artistic culture, stars might very well be walking among us.
Still, entertainment culture continues to be successful as the demand still exists and our tastes have shifted accordingly. But the public’s newfound preferences coupled with a hyperactive, bottom line-obsessed industry is crushing space for true art and demands a need for resurgence.
Schools like USC can ensure this happens by continuing to provide greater opportunities and outlets for creative expression outside of traditional academic rigor.
Even at USC, which has benefitted from its connections to Los Angeles and Hollywood, there is potential for growth.  For instance, while the school features strong arts-related programs and student organizations, it has yet to adopt a dance major.
In the search for worthy entertainers, the American audience is fickle, indecisive, bored and everything in between. Ungrounded ideas, which begin with just a sliver of cultural relevance, blow up to become nothing but smoke and mirrors. If boredom and disinterest is our insidious sickness, the growing pervasiveness of popular entertainment without true substance is the epidemic.
The question is now whether or not this generation stands in the position of establishing an entertainment culture with longevity or lasting appeal. Does current pop culture stand a chance at affecting social progress?
With young fresh college students at the forefront, the answer is yes.
Christopher Agutos is a junior majoring in political science and public relations. His column” Pop Life” ran every other Tuesday.
While USC does so much to develop substantial growth, it occasionally gets distracted from its goals and feeds us notoriety over quality and perpetuates our bad consumer habits. When Program Board announced that T-Pain – the quintessential superficial hustler with the least amount of artistic talent at the entire event – would headline Springfest 2010, a part of my soul died.  Despite the plethora of amazing acts throughout the day including Antonio Pontarelli who blew me away with his epic set powered by his electric violin, the quad remained a desolate place throughout the day.  Yet, when T-Pain was on stage, a mob amassed on the lawn as he danced his way through an incredibly under-whelming set.  If I wanted to see someone dance, the street performers on Venice or Santa Monica would have put on a better show.  As for the music, well, with the vocal tracks louder than T-Pain’s mic, I might as well have just gone to a club where a DJ could have mixed together a much stronger T-Pain medley without the braggadocio.  
And this is what our tuition dollars are going towards?  I wonder what President Sample would have thought if he watched a recording of this concert…
Anyways, the point is that record companies and USC promote these artists because its what the people like.  When art becomes corporate, consumer preference dictates the market, so if we want to see quality artists being rewarded in pop culture, let’s start with the man in the mirror.

Every time I hear someone call a person “illegal,” a chill goes down my spine.
No one is illegal. A human cannot be illegal.
Calling someone illegal is like treating the individual as a product, comparable to a banned substance and dehumanizing the person.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Since when did human beings become commodities that had the potential to be banned?
Even though I find the concept of labeling people illegal baffling at its core, many Californians are beginning to direct their anger at so-called illegal immigrants as the source of the state’s misfortune as universities, schools, hospitals and other institutions face severe budget cuts by Sacramento.
Those individuals might have an example to follow with a new piece of legislation approved by Arizona’s legislature, which calls for much stricter measures in trying to deport all illegal immigrants. The bill was written by the Republican State Sen. Russell Pearce and includes measures that would allow law enforcement officials to stop any presumed immigrant in the state and demand their respective federal and state forms of identification on the spot, even if the individual is a legal immigrant.
If the person turns out to be illegal, he would be transferred to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and deported. And if a legal immigrant is caught without appropriate forms, he could face up to six months in jail and a $500 fine. Even more shocking is that citizens could be held just for not having proper identification papers on them during the time of questioning.
The bill stipulates that if a police station is enforcing the new rules “to less than the full extent permitted,” it could face thousands of dollars in fines. Perhaps the most frightening aspect of the bill is that police officers can stop any individual for “reasonable suspicion” based on any two of the following: race, nationality and color. Supporters of the bill allege the legislation will pick out illegal immigrants and have them deported, which will free up government funds to benefit legal citizens.
However, many lawmakers and activists have criticized the bill, calling it reminiscent of apartheid-era South Africa and simply deplorable. State Rep. Raul Grijalva said the bill targets and discriminates against a specific demographic of the population. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, who is also the Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Immigration Reform, made a personal remark in an interview with CNN regarding the effect of the bill on average Hispanic-Americans: “I’m Puerto Rican. I was born in Chicago, and my family has been U.S. citizens for generations. But look at my face, listen to my voice. I’d probably get picked up in Arizona and questioned. Is that what we want in America?”
The immigration debate soon made its way closer to home when Roger Mahony, the cardinal of Los Angeles, compared the law to “German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques” on his website.
However, in the same city Mahony made that statement, supporters of tougher laws on illegal immigration pointed to crumbling schools and universities that have been greatly affected by the state’s budget cuts. In 2009, state officials estimated that illegal immigrants accounted for “$4 billion and $6 billion in costs, primarily for prisons and jails, schools and emergency rooms,” according to the Los Angeles Times. This fact infuriates some individuals who feel every dollar should only be spent on legal citizens.
After hearing the monetary-based argument of individuals against using government money for illegal immigrants, I am often stunned at how money seems to drive people’s decisions and not the need to help fellow human beings.
We have to understand the plight of illegal immigrants entering our state. Most leave their families in their hometown — a decision painful enough — to risk their lives and travel across the border to provide money to their families. After paying people most of their savings to sneak them across the border, many immigrants risk sheer humiliation, injury or death if caught and deported.
Those who make it here are given little if no respect in society and are forced to work for wages well below minimum wage — wages that are mostly sent to their families in their home countries that are counting on the money for food and other basic necessities.
After understanding the dismal situations most illegal immigrants face in coming to the United States, is it right to call them “criminals” and “illegals?” Are they really doing the wrong thing in trying to provide basic necessities for their families and provide better lives for their children?
Every human in California deserves at least the most basic of services such as emergency medical care and public education.
We are not wasting money by helping fellow human beings — we are doing the right thing. I am not advocating an open border situation in which everyone can easily and openly enter this state and nation ­— rather, amnesty should be granted to the present illegal immigrants and we should leave the border and immigration laws the way they are. If anything, the government needs to provide a fast-track for most illegal immigrants to achieve citizenship.
We need to look at the issue of illegal immigration not with a financial viewpoint but through the viewpoint of helping fellow humans.
Let’s hope everyone realizes that people aren’t costs — they’re people.

Did I also forget to mention that my Korean wife and Step Daughter also speak FLUENT ENGLISH and almost only speak Korean at home. I don’t believe that anyone should lose their native language but when you are out on the street and doing Business in this country believe it or not our national language is english
What part of ILLEGAL do people not understand? These people, and I am not just talking about Mexicans, but they are the main culprits here, are all breaking federal laws that have been on the books for years. There is no need to enact new laws against illegal immigration if our moronic federal government would enforce the laws already established. I’m all for LEGAL immigration. Hell my wife is a Legal immigrant from South Korea. She waited her 4-5 years while the paperwork was processed and her uncle, who earned his citizenship fighting with us in Vietnam and her father who fought with us in Korea, sponsored her and her daughter to come to this country for a shot at a better life. That was in 2005, we met in 2006 at a Korean restaurant and married 2 years later. She went about coming to this country the correct way. She didn’t sneak across the border and drop a kid in the nearest San Diego Hospital and sponge off of everybody. We as American Citizens need to pull our nut sacks down and take a stand against what is happening in this country and that means sending “ALL” illegal’s back no matter what country they are from. I don’t want to live by the adage “I work hard because millions of ILLEGALS need OBAMA care” That is another subject left for another day. I have worked hard for this university for the past 5 years as a plumber and would hate to see that my step daughter and my new baby daughter wont get the chance to go to this university for free as part of my incentive to work here because some ILLEGAL needs their spaces in line for a quality education. I guarantee that is not too far off if we keep going the way we are now. It is time to strip away citizenship for anchor babies. Just because you sneak across this border and plop down a kid should not make that kid an instant Citizen with all my free tax money. AMERICA, wake up and smell the crap storm coming.
Hey if we get stopped driving without a License we go to jail.  If there is a warrent out for my arrest for doing something illegal I go to jail.  If they are legal and doing things above board they will have nothing to  hide or worry about!  If not C-Ya!
George, I do not know of a time when I do not have any ID, be it my DL or some other form of ID. This law does not allow people to be stopped merely because they are walking down the street as some claim  or taking a walk in the park. There has to be reasonable cause. I am also sure if I do not have any ID the police will give me reasonable opportunity of obtaining it. (although I always have my wallet with me) The only people who do not have any ID are the illegals.
AN, suppose you don’t have you are stopped by an officer and DON’T have your identification or papers on you. You do realize that you could be jailed and fined for this, don’t you? Like I said, I believe we need to tighten our borders and crack down on employers who hire illegal aliens, but this dangerous bill is not the right way to do that.
Bottom Line the Illegal Aliens want all the benefits and do not particpate any any way positive to help uot our country.  I have zero compasion for any of them.  They are the first one’s on line when they can get something for nothing and the last one on line when it is good for our country.  SEND THEM ALL BACK THEY ARE A CANCER!  They get free lunches in public schools, free medical, educations, financial aid yet for some resaon they do not pay taxes, get car insurance, or contribute on any level.  The illegals are all a buch of selfish takers who are drowning all of us!
Illegal immigrants do pay taxes (see my post higher up the page).
“We are not wasting money by helping fellow human beings — we are doing the right thing.”
Yeah except for the part that eventually you will go broke with only this philosophy and no actual plan to intelligently implement economic growth for all nations involved. The US and Los Angeles, CA in particular will not be doing anyone any favors in the long run by slowly lowering living standards and become more like Mexico. Mexico is such a failed state that its people are killing themselves to come across the border. Now we are slowly becoming more like Mexico and we can not even talk about this as a problem. Just drive through East LA – is this what we want the US to become? What should be happening is Mexico try and turn their country like the US – not the US slowly morph into Mexico.
Or Mexico can just admit they do not know how to run a country and we can turn it into the largest 51st State of the USA.
Do you know what sends a chill down my spine? when I hear of a father and son being murdered in cold blood by an illegal in SFO (a sanctuary city) or when I hear of a rancher being murdered in Az. also by an illegal. Lets not play with semantics here. Illegal means against a law or statute and these people are here against the law or illegally. The Az law is in reaction to the inaction by the government to protect its citizens. While not all illegals are violent criminals (only about 17% are) they have ALL broken a federal law. I also agree that granting amnesty will only encourage more people to cross the border – after all why not if they are given all the benefits with none of the downsides. Why wait like the rest of us did? and oh by the way I have brown skin and fully support this Az law even if it means I may be stopped by a cop there and asked for my ID. I do that at airports anyway.
The border laws need to be changed and security tightened! I agree 100% Illegal immigration has to be better controlled. And yes, businesses that hire illegals need to be prosecuted.
What really makes me sad is the enthusiasm expressed by so many for this bill, which does nothing to address border security but merely promotes racial profiling, as the above poster pointed out.
…I’m completely in favor of tightening the border and prosecuting employers who hire illegal immigrants, but this bill is only feeding the wave of animosity people have towards an entire group, and serves to do little but enable racial profiling. Let’s say I’m Hispanic but a legal US citizen. I could be arrested for simply not carrying my papers on me at all times. How many of you have families who immigrated to the US in the last few decades? Do you carry your green card at all times? 
I agree that the onslaught of illegals causes problems for the infrastructure, but I am not so livid that I want to see families broken up to placate the masses. What I support is some form of amnesty for those already here, with new rules and conditions. Yes, they are here illegally and cannot expect to be given the same access to education and healthcare as documented immigrants, but is there so much hatred in the country that people will only be happy when illegals are treated without any decency? It’s entirely possible to crack down with humane considerations and this bill is a huge step in the opposite direction.
I also disagree with the term “illegal immigrants”. They are not “immigrants”, they are temporary criminal squatters who have yet to be deported. I prefer the term “alien invaders” but that’s just me.
my mother works in Santa Ana and teaches the children of many illegals. The children are legally US residents because their parents jumped the border, and had their child here for free, making their child a  citizen, this is what we call anchor babies. 
There is a reason that they spend so much money to get here, because they know its a free ride for health care, education and its all tax free. Meanwhile we, the tax paying citizens foot the bill, a bill we can no longer afford. Our schools cant get the resources to provide a well rounded education because all the money is going to people who milk the system.  I have no problem with immigration, but go about it the right way! and yes if your here ILLEGALLY, then your ILLEGAL. If your so adamant about humanizing the process you foot their bill. You get into a car accident with one who has no insurance and be stuck paying the damages yourself when the accident was their fault. 
Its not our job to spoon-feed the weak and poor of the world when we have plenty of problems with our own legal citizens, illegals have no right to be here, LITERALLY NO RIGHT. they can earn that right if they wait in line.
You clearly at either an international student or not from a state that deals with the heavy onset of illegals. maybe you should wake up and educate yourself. cuz your standing alone
Illegal immigrants do pay taxes (see post higher up the page).
Please explain to my daughter (USC student) whose Grandfather came here legally,served his country in the U.S Army,  took a course and became a citizen and paid taxes his entire life why and how he should welcome these freeloaders  by giving them everything they want that he had to work so hard for and earn?
Send them  alll back each and everyone one of those self entitled morons.
They are arrorgant in what they feel is due to them and they do nothing but drag us down.  Crime, Jails, Hospitals, Schools, aid, not paying taxes, not having car insurance, I could.go on and on you get the picture just open your eyes!…They are bankrupting this country and fast.  I wonder what Mexico would do for you if you were there illegally.Throw your ass right in jail!
God forbid one of these indivduals you call human beings and not “illegal” totals your car in an accident!  
I wonder what the first word out  of your mouth would be when your insurance company informs you that you are out of luck becaue the individual that demolished your car and caused 200k in medical bills by someone who was here underthe radar!  
You are so full of it!
Your argument is basically that because these people already have limitations on their rights, that indirectly threaten you, their rights should be limited even further simply in order to protect your rights. I think it is an extremely selfish argument. Also you are focusing on a extreme situation resulting from a single minor matter at risk, which you blow up as much as is possible in order to justify your argument that this minopr matter should be definite in deciding the fate of an entire group of human beings. Its very poor logic.
also im pretty sure there is some covert racism at work here.
Oh yeah! Rule #1 in the liberal handbook: If you can’t win the argument, accuse your opponent of racism and run away!
No one is illegal… well, except for the part where they entered the country… um… illegally. Rocket science this ain’t. 
From what I gather (and I grant that I may be wrong, since I haven’t done a whole lot of digging), asking for documents can only be done following “lawful contact,” e.g. a traffic stop or suchlike. “That guy looks Mexican!” doesn’t count. 
“I am not advocating an open border situation in which everyone can easily and openly enter this state and nation ­— rather, amnesty should be granted to the present illegal immigrants and we should leave the border and immigration laws the way they are. If anything, the government needs to provide a fast-track for most illegal immigrants to achieve citizenship.”
We did that back in… 1986, I believe. Shockingly, granting amnesty to the current crop of illegal immigrants tells future would-be illegal immigrants that all they need to do is hang out long enough, and BAM! Citizenship! Sure does suck to be those schmucks who waited their turn in line to enter the country legally… What do you expect to see happen? And how is this proposal of yours *not* an effective open border? The border is quite porous. So if you can manage to cross it, well, welcome fellow citizen!

Authorities on cultural diplomacy, communication and international relations spoke Friday about the transnational advocacy networks and their impact on the field of public diplomacy as part of the Association of Public Diplomacy Scholars’ annual conference.
APDS aims to bring together students interested in the field to form a network promoting public diplomacy. This weekend’s event was the second annual conference.
Colin Robertson, the keynote speaker and a senior research fellow of the Canadian Defense and Foreign Affairs Institute, spoke about his experiences with public diplomacy and international relations.
“Transnational advocacy is a very timely concept in public diplomacy right now,” Robertson, director of the Canada-U.S. Project, said.
“Technologies like Facebook, Google, iChat, etc. are changing transnational communication in so many ways. Our societies are becoming increasingly global and diverse, which puts a premium on diplomacy with other countries.”
Robertson’s opening address was followed by two panels, “Hollywood, Human Rights and Transnational Advocacy” and “Social Media and Transnational Advocacy Networks.”
Alex Franklin, a professor in the School of Cinematic Arts, spoke at the first panel about the role of Hollywood in cultural diplomacy and the role the media plays in breaking down international barriers.
“What people in public diplomacy need to understand is that creating a dialogue between nations or even between separate cultures is always key,” Franklin said. “In Hollywood, for instance, if you want to make an impact as an outsider you need to speak their language, to know who to talk to and what to say.”
Franklin is currently working to develop a cultural diplomacy course at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
The conference was chaired by Nicholas J. Cull, director of the masters program in public diplomacy. Cull is a USC professor of public diplomacy and volunteered to chair after working closely with his students to select this year’s conference theme. All the members of APDS are Cull’s students.
“It’s great to see leaders in these fields come together to share their most effective practices with each other and with the next generation of advocates. I think the conference as a whole was very eye-opening to everyone there — that’s what a top grad school should be about,” Cull said.

Max Wittek, a standout quarterback from Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., has chosen to attend to USC upon graduation in 2011, joining the group of other Mater Dei quarterbacks such as Matt Leinart and Matt Barkley who decided to become Trojans.
Wittek, who was a backup for Barkley at Mater Dei before taking on the starting job as a junior, received offers from numerous schools including UCLA, Notre Dame, Florida, Florida State, Georgia and Nebraska.
The 6-foot-3, 200 pound quarterback credited USC’s legacy of great quarterbacks as well as his relationship with USC coach Lane Kiffen, recruiting coordinator Ed Oregeron and quarterbacks coach Clay Helton with helping make his decision.
“I had a checklist of things I wanted in a program and everywhere else had a few of them but every time I thought about it, it came back to USC and it ended up being the school I was always thinking about,” Wittek told ESPN.
Wittek completed 136 of 230 passes for 2,126 yards, 15 touchdowns and nine interceptions last season in his first year starting at the varsity level.
Mater Dei coach Bruce Rollinson believes Wittek’s speed sets him apart from the rest of the recruits at his position. He ran for 189 yards and two touchdowns last season.
“Max is, foot-speed wise, faster than the others,” Rollinson said. “His straight-ahead speed is worth noting. I’m not a big 40-yard dash guy but I would imagine if I was he’d run a 4.6.”
Wittek says that he has a great relationship with Barkley and feels comfortable playing under him while he adjusts to football at the college level.
“We spent so much time together at Mater Dei, watching film, at practices and games. I see him a lot when I go to USC and I work out with him every once in a while,” he said. “We call and text all the time and it’s going to be great to play together again.”
