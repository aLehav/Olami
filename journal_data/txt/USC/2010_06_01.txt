The Trojan Family Room in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center remains empty a little while longer, though the fireplace was tested last week in the first test burning. The building received temporary occupancy on May 13, and will be open to the public in a few weeks.

A USC professor has received a $200,000 Partner University Fund award to develop a new type of male contraceptive drug.
Charles McKenna, who is also the chair of chemistry at the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, hopes to create contraceptive drug for commercial use that affects sperm development. McKenna’s idea was one of 12 proposals selected from among 78.
McKenna, with expertise in chemistry, will work with researchers in France at the Institute for Structural Biology Jean-Pierre Ebel and the Institut Albert Bonniot, benefiting from each other’s knowledge.
Despite the distance between Los Angeles and France, McKenna said to USC News this space would not hinder the research.
“The fact that we’re separated by 6,000 miles is no longer a major factor,” said McKenna. “What’s so exciting about this is that we’ll be engaging in a kind of collaboration that typically would be done with the Department of Biology or the Keck School of Medicine at USC … but these biologists happen to be in Europe.”
Researchers will communicate regularly through video conferencing and visit each other’s institutions.
McKenna recently received the USC Provost’s Prize for Teaching With Technology, which awards faculty for successfully integrating technology into their courses.
McKenna is also fluent in French and has worked previously with researchers in France.
“That to me was a perfect fit for the program,” said Mireille Guyarder, the scientific attache for the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles, to USC News.
McKenna said to USC News he expects the collaboration between his department at USC and the French institutions to help build relations, potentially encouraging future graduate students at USC to train in France, or students in France to come to USC.
“At USC, the general impetus has been to globalize research,” McKenna said to USC News. “The emphasis has been mainly on the Pacific Rim. But there are also great research opportunities in Europe at this time.”
The participating biology students in France will be eligible to partake in the USC chemistry department’s Interdisciplinary Program in Drug Discovery.
The Partner University Fund hopes to support innovative and sustainable partnerships between French and U.S. institutions of research and higher education.
Sponsored by the French American Cultural Exchange Foundation in 2007, the fund receives private donations and contributions from the French government.
McKenna learned about the award last fall during an Egide Foundation-sponsored trip to France. Guyader encouraged McKenna to apply for the award.
A previous version of this article  incorrectly listed the amount of the Partner University Fund award as $2,000. The actual amount is $200,000.
Haha I am actually the only reply to this incredible article?!
i believe the correct amount is 200,000 dollars. 2000 in research money is laughable.
In any case, congratulations!

Dan Schnur, director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, has been appointed as chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, the governor’s office announced Tuesday.
Politico · Dan Schnur, who has worked on a variety of political campaigns and is currently an associate professor in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, has been the director of the Unruh Institute for two years. - Daily Trojan File Photo 
Schnur, who is also an assistant professor at USC, will take a leave of absence from his position at the university while he is chair of the FPPC, which promotes transparency and enforces fair practices in California politics and elections.
“Equality, transparency and honesty in our political process are essential to the success of this state and I look forward to continuing the reform that the people of California demanded,” Schnur said in the press release sent out by the governor’s office.
His term on the FPPC will last until January 2011, when he will be up for reappointment.
The appointment by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger comes after former FPPC chair Ross Johnson stepped down in April.
“Schnur has spent years teaching and advocating for equality and transparency in California politics and I am grateful that he will continue his service to our state in this new role,” Schwarzenegger said in the press release.
Schnur has been director of the Unruh Institute since 2008 and a professor at USC since 2004. He has been a key player in expanding the influence of the institute and the student opportunities, according to the USC College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
He has worked on presidential and gubernatorial elections, and one of his main objectives as FPPC chair will be to work to ensure fair practices during the upcoming California state elections in November.

The City of Los Angeles released an Environmental Impact Report last Thursday regarding USC’s new development plan that will increase available university-affiliated housing in North University Park and provide new retail outlets, including a movie theater, a grocery store and restaurants.
“This project was developed to provide USC with badly needed additional student housing, provide new academic space, and to create a vibrant retail space that will serve both our surrounding community and our academic community,” said USC Vice President for Government and Community Relations Tom Sayles in a press release.
The notice of completion for the report lists the boundaries for the proposed project as between 30th and Hoover streets, Jefferson Boulevard, Exposition Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.
The release of the report began a 45-day review period ending July 12. On June 16, the City Planning Department plans to hold a community forum. Currently the report is available to the public.
It this notice were to be truly usefull you should have included a web link.
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.

The lyrics to a song called “Ali in the Jungle” begins with the opening statement: It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.
For the USC men’s tennis team, that statement could not fit the script any better as the Trojans rallied from two doubles losses against the No. 2 seeded Tennessee Volunteers to win the 2010 NCAA championship.
Jubilation · Sophomore Daniel Nguyen (middle) was named the NCAA tournament’s Most Outstanding Player after a title-clinching win over Tennessee’s Tennys Sandgren. After losing the first set, Nguyen came back to dominate the second and third sets to win. - Courtesy USC Sports Information 
“We certainly showed the heart of a champion,” coach Peter Smith said.  “When it comes tournament time, we play the whole thing to peak at this moment and that’s exactly what we did.”
The Volunteers came into the night searching for their first NCAA title and also riding a 21-match winning streak.
And that momentum carried over to doubles play where they put the Trojans in a hole, winning both matches and also breaking senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson 17-game doubles match winning streak in the process.
“They were just too good for us in doubles,” Smith said.  “We were either going to be champions or not.”
But the tide would soon turn in singles match play when Johnson defeated Tennessee’s Boris Conkic, 6-3, 6-2.
Johnson’s victory gave the Trojans momentum and Farah defeated No. 1 nationally ranked Tennessee player J.P. Smith, 7-6 (3), 6-4.
Junior Peter Lucassen brought the Trojans one step closer to a national title by defeating Matteo Fago, 6-4, 6-3.
The stage was set for sophomore Daniel Nguyen but he lost the first set to Tennys Sandgren.
“I was definitely a little nervous in the beginning but I just stayed on there and fought out there,” Nguyen said. 
And fight he did as Nguyen won 12 of the next 13 sets, defeating Sandgren, 6-7 (3), 6-1, 6-0, to clinch the title for the Trojans.
“We got down in doubles but I never doubted our team that we could go out and win the four singles and we came out strong and finished strong,” Johnson said.
For Nguyen’s play during the tournament, he was named the NCAA tournament’s Most Outstanding Player.
Other Trojans earning NCAA All-Tournament Team honors were Farah and Johnson (No. 1 doubles), Nguyen and freshman JT Sundling (No. 2 doubles), Farah (No. 1 singles), Johnson (No. 2 singles), Nguyen (No. 4 singles) and Lucassen (No. 6 singles).
With the win, the Trojans captured their 18th NCAA men’s tennis championship overall and first back-to-back titles since the 1993-1994 seasons.
“It’s players that win it,” Smith said.  “Those kids are gutty and they’re talented and they’re able to finish.”

Last year, Catherine Ricafort graduated from USC with a degree in industrial engineering. Today, she’s starring in a national touring production of A Chorus Line. It opened in Los Angeles yesterday.
Surprised? So is she.
How high · Catherine Ricafort (third from right) plays Connie Wong in the touring production of A Chorus Line, now at the Pantages Theatre. - Photo courtesy of Broadway/L.A. 
“I knew that musical theater was fun,” Ricafort said, “but I never thought that I wanted to do it for a living or pursue it professionally.”
But now that she is, she says it’s a dream come true.
It isn’t as though Ricafort had never stepped foot on a stage before securing her role in A Chorus Line. Singing and dancing were the pastimes of her youth, and her mom turned her on to Broadway show tunes at an early age.
In college, Ricafort performed in a handful of dance companies and shined in the SoCal VoCals, one of USC’s most admired a cappella groups.
“I always kept it up because I knew it was something I couldn’t live without,” she said.
Ricafort knew when she picked USC that she was expected to pursue a technical education, so she chose industrial engineering. She flourished in the program, earning top marks, winning coveted research grants and scoring impressive internships. Although she picked up a minor in musical theater, singing and dancing were always firmly rooted in the extracurricular realm. Ricafort never seriously considered herself Broadway-bound.
But sometime during her senior year, she realized the least she could do was give it a shot.
“This is something you can only do while you’re young,” Ricafort said. “I figured that before I get fully into the momentum of an engineering degree, I should try for this, at least try to shoot for my dream to be on Broadway while I can.”
So while some of her classmates went backpacking through Europe after graduation, Ricafort packed her bags for New York. Anyone who wants to be in musical theater, she noted, moves to the Big Apple.
“This was sort of like my treat to myself,” she said.
She found a place to live and started immediately on the grueling audition circuit, frequently waking up at 5 or 6 a.m. to get in line with hundreds of other people all dreaming the same dream. She remembers the process being “really, really scary” for someone who had always lived close to home.
“They say the golden rule of musical theater is that you’ll land one out of every 100 auditions that you get,” Ricafort said.
But it only took Ricafort a few weeks — not 100 auditions, but a lot, she said — before she got her lucky break.
She was cast in On the Town at the well-known Paper Mill Playhouse outside of New York.
But A Chorus Line was her big break.
The audition process consisted of several rounds, each of which ended in a series of cuts. First, participants were asked to do a dance combination. If they weren’t cut, they were asked to sing. If they got through that round, they were asked to act. Then the process repeated itself.
“It was very intimidating,” Ricafort said, “because we were auditioning for some of Broadway’s greatest legends.”
Especially nerve-racking for Ricafort was the fact that she was auditioning in front of Baayork Lee, the choreographer for the show and the inspiration for the role of Connie Wong, which Lee originated on Broadway in 1975. It was the role Ricafort was hoping to get, and eventually did.
“It was hard to live up to that and impress her, but she showed a lot of confidence in me,” Ricafort said. “It’s been an honor and a privilege to work with her.”
Also on the auditioning panel was the show’s director, acclaimed Broadway veteran Bob Avian, who took home a Tony for his original choreography of the show.
Ricafort — a newcomer to the scene with nothing in her back pocket but passion and an old dream — never let herself think she had the role in the bag, afraid she would psych herself out. She treated the ordeal as though it were only a workshop.
“Don’t think about what’s at the end, just enjoy the process,” she kept telling herself.
When Ricafort eventually got the part, she was, of course, thrilled. It was exactly what she had hoped for when she moved to New York.
A Chorus Line is the simple story of 17 dancers auditioning for a limited number of spots in a show — a premise that resonated particularly with Ricafort, who was in that same place. The stage is bare and the costumes aren’t fancy; it’s only the performers and the audience. An innovative work in its time, the show won nine Tony Awards and might be said to have anticipated reality shows like American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance?, which put talented hopefuls in front of not only industry veterans but a national audience — to be scrutinized on an even larger scale.
Of course, these are actors, but the feelings aroused in the audience are essentially the same. Some live vicariously through these players; others are content merely to enjoy their formidable talents.
Ricafort said you can have no knowledge of the theater and still take something away from the show.
“The stories that the characters go through — the inspirations that drive them and the struggles that they face — can be applied to any career that you’re pursuing,” she said.
As for Ricafort’s career, she certainly hasn’t given up on engineering. Before she landed A Chorus Line, she was working on her master’s degree in engineering through the USC Viterbi Distance Education Network, but had to put it off while she was on tour. Asked about the surprise she gets when she tells people she majored in engineering and is now performing onstage, Ricafort was quick to point out that theater people aren’t airheads.
“While doing theater professionally, I’ve actually met a number of very brilliant minds in the business,” she said, noting that one of her fellow cast members is pursuing a physics degree at Columbia and is going to work for NASA after the tour.
“Theater seems like just song and dance and happy, fun playtime on the outside, but it requires a lot of discipline, strength and a lot of thinking,” Ricafort said. “You have to adapt to so many stories, people and environments. It requires a lot of brain power in addition to the performing talent.”
The Pantages Theatre in Hollywood is the final stop for the A Chorus Line tour, and it will be there for the next two weeks. Students can get rush tickets for $25 if they don’t mind waiting around for a couple hours before the show.
After the curtain falls for the final time, Ricafort plans to return to New York, where she’ll start auditioning all over again. She isn’t quite sure what the future will bring, but she doesn’t necessarily want to know.
“I think I’ll just see where it takes me, and take it one step at a time,” she said. “I’m still young, and I don’t necessarily have to decide everything right now. If opportunities present themselves, I’ll take them.”

The recent bluster surrounding Arizona’s controversial ruling on immigrant documentation has created yet another divide for opposing activists to shout across. But amid all the clamor, a problem closer to Los Angeles has been swept under the rug.
A study published last week by Californians Together, a civil rights coalition in support of English-learners, highlighted the significant gaps in public high schools across California, proving that our educational systems for English as Second Language students are severely lacking.
The study found that almost 60 percent of ESL students in California high schools have not achieved written proficiency in the language, even after six years of a U.S. education.
Though most of the polled students were bilingual citizens who preferred to speak English, the study showed that the disparity between speaking and reading comprehension was severe enough to jeopardize graduation in a majority of the cases.
This is not a minor problem. A quarter of all public school attendees in California are English-learners — at 1.6 million strong, the largest bloc of English-learners in the nation. It’s clear that the current modus operandi is not working; California schools can no longer take a cavalier attitude when it comes to catering to this demographic.
The study also found that most schools in the system don’t take the necessary steps required by state law to provide for English-learning students, which include training teachers and keeping an eye on students’ progress throughout their schooling.
This is no longer an issue that can be written off as inconsequential; a substantial portion of the students currently in California public schools are forced to drop out each year because their education system is not serving them adequately. In a city like Los Angeles, where — according to the Los Angeles Times — 55 percent of all students are children of immigrants, there needs to be a safety net written into the legislation.
A group of teachers have already taken the mantle of improving the tenuous situation; last Thursday, more than 200 educators convened in Alhambra, Calif., to address the situation.
But this is only the first step in what needs to be drastic and sweeping reform. Changes need to be made in the infrastructure of schools, including implementing more programs for ESL students and creating more effective teacher training programs to adequately prepare educators for the challenges ahead. But, most of all, these changes need to be enforced — not prescribed and then forgotten.

Another example of why the amnesty granted illegal aliens during the Reagan administration was a failure.  It seems nobody wanted to recognize that this amnesty would cause millions more people to come here in hopes they would eventually get their amnesty as well.  All the while the costs continue to mount.  Hope is a great companion but a poor planner folks.
Do the teachers/schools have a perverse incentive in keeping ESL students in the ESL program? The program should work the teachers out of a job as the students become proficient in English.

One year ago, the USC men’s golf team entered the national championship as one of the favorites to win the title, with a talented and experienced lineup featuring three All-Americans.
Fast forward to this week, where the No. 10 Trojans are fielding the second youngest squad among the competitors and are regarded as underdogs to challenge for the championship at the Honors Course in Chattanooga, Tenn.
“This year is a different dynamic compared to my first couple years,” junior Matt Giles said. “It’s a very young team with three freshmen in the starting lineup.”
The young Trojans have begun to mature in the second half of the season, finishing in the top three in five of their last six tournaments, including a second place result at last week’s NCAA West Regional in Bremerton, Wash.
USC did, however, finish 29 strokes behind No. 4 Washington last week, one of this year’s title favorites along with No. 1 Oklahoma State, defending NCAA champion No. 2 Texas A&M and No. 4 Stanford.
USC coach Chris Zambri said the Trojans didn’t take Washington’s large margin of victory as a sign that they couldn’t compete with the Huskies and other top teams.
“One thing is that we’re not going to be in Washington, we’re going to be down in Tennessee,” Zambri said. “The other is the way the tournament is formatted. [Washington] could play like that again but go up against a team in match play that is hot and we wouldn’t have to play them.”
The new NCAA championships format, used for the first time last year, calls for three rounds of stroke play from Tuesday to Thursday to determine the top eight teams out of the 30 squad field.
The eight advancing teams are then seeded for three days of single elimination match play from Friday to Sunday to determine a national champion.
“I think we have the ability to play with a team like [Washington], but we don’t necessarily have to,” Zambri said about the format.
Last season, USC finished third in the stroke play and lost to Michigan in the first round of the match play, 3-2.
Giles, a two-time All-American, and sophomore Steve Lim are the only two starters back from last year’s quarterfinalists.
For much of this season, Giles couldn’t replicate the form that made him the nation’s top-ranked player for a long stretch last year. Still, Giles posted three top-10 finishes on the season.
Lim, second on the team in scoring average, has finished in the top 15 four times this year.
Freshman T.J. Vogel led USC with a 72.16 scoring average and grabbed two second place results on the season.
Fellow freshman Martin Trainer was a fixture in the lineup for the Trojans all season and placed in the top 25 six times.
Sam Smith, the third freshman starter for USC, earned the final spot in the starting lineup.
His breakout performances this year were a tie for 20th at the Pac-10 championships and a tie for 24th at the NCAA West Regional.
“Looking back on his record for us throughout the season, whenever he’s teed it up for us, he’s contributed quite a bit by putting in scoring rounds,” Zambri said of Smith.
With the young team, the Trojans are embracing their status as underdogs.
“It doesn’t really matter what’s happened to this point in time,” Giles said. “This is where we are and we need to go out and play well.”
“We’ve all gotten so much better,” Smith added. “We want to bring a ring back to ’SC.”

It’s no secret that USC has had its fair share of legendary coaches pass through Heritage Hall.
Football coach John McKay won four national titles from 1962-1974 before leaving for the NFL. Baseball coach Rod Dedeaux captured 11 NCAA championships during his 45-year-tenure with USC.
Collected · Men’s and women’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic is known for his keen eye for talent and an undying love for the game. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
Men’s track & field coach Dean Cromwell may have even been the most successful of the bunch with 12 national championships to his name during his near 40-year-run with the program.
Nowadays, it may be wise to add current men’s and women’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic to that exclusive coaching fraternity as well.
That is because over the past year, Vavic has orchestrated two national championship runs with both the men’s and women’s water polo teams, the third time in his career that he has led both squads to the NCAA title in the same academic year.
“It’s very special for us to do it in the same year because it takes quite a bit of commitment from the players and the coaches,” Vavic said. “It’s lots of hard work. In the end, it’s very satisfying.”
Just last month, the Women of Troy, under the leadership of Vavic, exorcised their postseason demons by defeating top-seeded Stanford to earn the NCAA championship, after falling to crosstown rival UCLA in the finals two years prior. But 2010 was different for Vavic and company.
“This year the maturity level was far better than in the past,” Vavic said. “In sports, you have to fight for each other. Earlier, we were playing as individuals. But over time, we became a much better unit and really matured.”
On the men’s circuit, Vavic enjoyed similar success, leading the Trojans to their second consecutive national championship last December with a heart-thumping 7-6 win over UCLA in the title game, marking the first time in his career that one of his teams had won back-to-back championships.
“In the past, it has always been harder to win in consecutive years because the guys get complacent,” Vavic explained. “They want to get some slack. Because they won, they feel they shouldn’t be working as hard as they did in the past. They kind of feel entitled. I don’t give them that entitlement, and there is a conflict.”
But despite coming off an undefeated season in 2008, the Trojans avoided that conflict, following up their strong performance a year earlier with an equally impressive 2009 campaign.
“Fortunately this year, our leadership was strong enough with guys like [Shea] Buckner, J.W. [Krumpholz], and [Matt] Sagehorn,” Vavic added. “I think the leadership was the difference.”
With three NCAA titles coming since December of 2008, it’s no secret that the Trojans have reached the mountain top of the collegiate water polo world.  But as usual, Vavic was quick to deflect any praise in his teams’ journeys to the summit.
“The fact that I have really good assistant coaches makes a huge difference. We have consistently had a coaching staff that hasn’t changed over the last three years,” Vavic said. “That really helps and gives us stability.”
But bringing hardware to the confines of McDonald’s Swim Stadium hasn’t been an overnight journey for Vavic and his staff.
Since coming to USC as an assistant from UCLA in 1992, the Yugoslavian native has faced a plethora of challenges.
For one, Vavic oversaw the women’s water polo team’s move from a club sport in 1994 to Division II in 1995 and to Division I in 1996. Not until 1999 was the program even fully funded and able to issue scholarships to recruits. As a result, winning was rare.
“It was very frustrating those first few years,” Vavic said. “We were losing to teams like Berkeley and UCLA by 20 goals. It was really tough.”
But with an increase in funding and support from the athletic department, Vavic’s staff quickly brought the program up to par, winning a national championship in 1999.
“It’s like starting from scratch,” Vavic said. “You’re a poor guy with no money and you start working and make your first 50 bucks. Then, you go on and make a million. That’s what it feels like. I feel like a million-dollar man now because our program has developed.
“It wasn’t easy.”
Such a competitive spirit has proven vital in the success Vavic has enjoyed during his stint with the Trojans.
“You know going into USC that he has a reputation of being a hard-nosed, no-nonsense kind of guy, and he definitely lives up to that reputation,” outgoing senior goalie Tumua Anae said.
But the journey toward the top on the men’s side of things wasn’t a smooth ride either.  Joining a program that had never won a national championship since its inception in 1922, Vavic was instrumental in bringing USC its first national championship in 1998 as a men’s co-head coach along with John Williams. Since then, Vavic and the Trojans have gone on to win four more titles, bringing his career total to eight, which includes three with the women.
For those who know Vavic, however, his success is not a big surprise.
“You can see how passionate about water polo he is and how competitive he is,” Anae said. “He hates to lose and you can see that in the way he approaches every second of practice.  He’s all business on the pool deck.”
That type of attitude has continued to earn the respect of many of his former players.
“I have been very fortunate to play for a coach with an enormous amount of knowledge and experience,” Anae said. “He has a great amount of resources and I was lucky enough to enjoy those resources for four years.”
But despite the success, complacency doesn’t figure to settle in anytime soon.
“All my goals for the future are connected to continuing what we’ve been doing so far at USC,” Vavic said. “That’s really it. The only thing I’m really thinking about is winning more championships.”

On a picturesque Memorial Day afternoon in Southern California, I ventured out into the streets of Los Angeles in search of the city’s most historic landmark.
In a city often defined by glitz and glamour, I don’t think you could have blamed me for choosing the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Santa Monica Pier or even Grauman’s Chinese Theatre.
But for me — an outsider simply looking for a destination that could capture the essence of this metropolis’ vast history — the venue was a simple choice: the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, celebrating its 87th anniversary last month.
As I walked toward the stadium, it became apparent that this impromptu history lesson would be short-lived, as metal gates surrounded the now-dormant facility.
While the trip would not provide this inquisitive visitor with the up-close experience I had envisioned, one look through the aging peristyle arches was more than enough. As I glanced beyond the entrance façade and beneath the Olympic cauldron, the summer-cut lawn and endless array of seats were all I could see.
I stood there enthralled for a few moments, grinned a little to myself and soon departed for home.
On a day often celebrated with a large barbeque or a swim at the beach, it’s easy to understand why my adventure to a lifeless sports stadium would garner puzzled looks and skeptical inquiries from those of you reading these words.
But to me, an individual who still hasn’t grasped the beauty and tradition of this City of Angels, what more fitting destination on a day of remembrance than the Coliseum — a place whose hallowed grounds provide a unique connection between the past and present.
In 1921, as the nation began to recover from the losses sustained during the first World War, the city of Los Angeles, behind a lucrative (at the time, at least) $950,000 investment, determined the best way to memorialize the efforts of the war’s veterans was to commission an athletic stadium in their honor.
What ensued from this gesture no one could have foreseen.
When the gates opened in May 1923, the majestic 76,000-seat creation of John and Donald Parkinson, single-handedly transformed the role of a sporting venue from merely a host to the canvas by which many of this city’s defining masterpieces were painted on.
From the Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984 (the Coliseum is the only site in the world to host two Olympics), to the NFL’s first Super Bowl (also hosted Super Bowl VII), to the 1959 World Series (which became the first Fall Classic games to be played on the West Coast and only to ever reach over 90,000 fans in attendance per game), to the four professional and two collegiate football teams to call this place home (Dons, Chargers, Rams, Raiders, UCLA and USC), the Coliseum’s walls tell the type of story to whet any die-hard sports fan’s appetite.
While this prestigious institution holds the memories of some of history’s most memorable athletic performances, what makes the Coliseum more than just a legendary stadium is its commitment to maintaining a near-century-long legacy.
When you can boast a who’s who of visitors that at some point in their illustrious careers made your cement-clad structure their muse or individual stage (Jesse Owens, Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and Pope John Paul II, just to name a few) it’s hard to resist getting caught up in the sports industry’s current approach on how to make venues into household names.
While the importance of stadiums has essentially shifted from preserving what was once thought to be the timeless annals of our most prized games to how can we better appease a commercialism-driven society, the Coliseum has remained relatively true to its initial intention: a memorial.
No, the Coliseum does not have any of the modern-day, trendy architectural features that are often commonplace around the country these days.
It’s not ornate, easily accessible for visitors or particularly fan-friendly when it comes to amenities.
Not every seat in the house is a good seat, the wealthy won’t find any luxurious boxes to escape the grimy, crowded stands filled with loud-mouthed sports enthusiasts and, to be frank, it doesn’t reside in a part of town that is famous for its glitz.
Though it has undergone four renovations in its eight-plus decades as a city monument, each tweak and improvement never tarnished or erased the imprint of its presence.
The Coliseum that welcomed in a new era of athletic achievement and ingenuity in the field of structural design with a USC football victory over Pomona College back in October 1923 still stands as the central tapestry in a city whose fabric is woven together by entertainment and tradition.
While Angelenos remain content for now with having USC as the only tenants to call the Coliseum home — as long as we keep winning, of course — the NFL is destined to make a return to trip to Los Angeles. The question isn’t if, it’s simply when.
One day when the ink from this article fades and men with more money than they know what to do with finally devise a plan that sticks, will this city still marvel at the lasting foundation it helped create over these last 87 years?
Will high-definition scoreboards, cushy stadium seats and lavish business suites manufacture enough sentiment to overtake this living, breathing testament to the city’s storied past?
As I took one final peek over my shoulder at the renowned edifice, these questions ran through my mind until I was stopped in my tracks by a man wearing an American flag bandana, who looked as worn as the stadium he now stood beneath.
Instinctually, I reached into my pocket for some change, but he cut me off.
“Ain’t she something, a gem.”
I smiled and shook my head in agreement. He was spot on. It’s a real diamond in the rough.

With fully customizable characters, level designing, a variety of weapons and online matches that can accommodate up to 12 players, ModNation Racers takes the best elements of games like Little Big Planet and the Mario Kart series and improves upon them.
Developed by United Front Games, this Playstation 3 title should feel similar to Little Big Planet in its philosophy of “Play, Create, Share” and in its intuitiveness. As a kart racer, it does not take great leaps and bounds to innovation; instead, it focuses on polished and diverse gameplay.
With the opportunity to create unique characters, or ‘mods,’ players can feel as though they are racing in several different games at once.
The game debuted on May 25, and already there are hundreds of different mods, ranging from Maggie Simpson to Darth Vader. And thanks to the game’s uploading system, each mod can be used by anyone.
Character creation is one of the first things a player does upon beginning gameplay; from there it only gets easier to be sucked in. With over 40 different skins available and the option to use an array of colors, clothes and accessories, a player can spend quite a while deciding how best to design a unique character and even longer creating a very detailed replica of already familiar characters.
Unlike more realistic professional driving simulation games, ModNation Racers employs some of the livelier elements of kart racing and does so well. Races are three laps each with up to 12 players permitted in each heat and involve a variety of items to shift the tempo, including boost lanes to gain speed, drifting to cut corners and racetrack weaponry, such as missiles and electric bolts. In the track editor, these can all be altered.
The game utilizes the Playstation 3 console to its fullest potential and feels like a more refined version of older kart racing games. The drawback to the updated gameplay, however, is the loading times from screen to screen, which can slow down the otherwise quick pace of the game.
Bright and vivid images give the game a decidedly cartoony feel, making it all the more appealing to a wide audience. It is easy enough to pick up and play that inexperienced players needn’t worry about making fools of themselves. For those interested in competing, there are plenty of time trials and a leveling system to keep track of skills.
Other useful additions are the four-player split screen and the option of playing online with a friend. This is often a neglected feature in kart racing games, so it’s nice to see ModNation Racers making full use of its host console’s potential.
Although the game is centered around user-generated content and the multi-player experience, there is a full story mode included for newer players to practice on.
A useful centerpiece to help organize all of the game’s different features is the Online Modspot. This hub functions as a sort of interactive menu and serves as the jumping-off point from which new players begin gameplay.
Rather than clicking through a dashboard, players simply drive toward buildings of the desired function, such as the Creation Station or a building housing competitive racing.
The Online Modspot is also where players can meet each other and chat via text or headset. One of the most important features is real-time streaming of top players, top tracks, coming attractions, daily tournaments and the most popular mods, which, as of this writing, are Spider-Man, Iron Man and Super Mario.
Community is difficult to achieve in most new games, but the constantly updating live stream works to accomplish that.
With its endless creative potential and a strong online component, ModNation Racers looks to be in for a long future of community-driven gameplay.

From its aggressive advertising campaign to the conspicuous use of a colon in its title, it’s obvious that Disney hopes to create another Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster franchise like Pirates of the Caribbean with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The May 28 release combines flashy visual effects, chiseled muscles and vaguely Arabic imagery to generate an oddly satisfying, campy ride that will appease nerds hungry for blood and Playstation nostalgia.
Royal bloodshed · As adopted orphan-turned-prince Dastan, Jake Gyllenhaal dons the leather vestments of a summer blockbuster action star. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. - Photo courtesy of Disney Enterprises, Inc. 
The film even starts out like the beginning of an epic video game — fitting, since it’s based on one — complete with melodrama, slow motion shots and a quick, oversimplified setup of a ridiculous plot with actors that don’t quite fit their roles.
Most notably, expecting moviegoers to buy that Jake Gyllenhaal could possibly be from anywhere in the Middle East requires perhaps a greater suspension of disbelief than is reasonable to ask. Though the plot leaves his origins uncertain, the film gives itself an out by making Gyllenhaal’s character Dastan an orphan adopted by the king. All the same, one can’t help but gaze into Gyllenhaal’s eyes and see Donnie Darko, not an action hero.
After seeing Dastan sack the holy city of Alamut by scaling walls, leaping from ceiling to ceiling and making the city his personal jungle gym, viewers can look past his long and terribly stringy hair and forgive the actor’s forced accent.
The fact that director Mike Newell strategically employs the actor’s pretty-boy smile and leather-encased body makes up for a lot.
Regrettably, the rest of the ensemble blends in with the background of the film, which has a hyper-opulent aesthetic resembling a blend of Disneyland’s Indiana Jones attraction and the kingdom of Agrabah from Aladdin.
The only other star of the movie, the Jafar-like, jealous brother of the king, Nizam, is played by a thoroughly underused Ben Kingsley, whose stately demeanor and threatening goatee make an excellent — though cartoonish — villain with a truly creepy band of assassins: the dreaded, spike- and snake-yielding Hassansins, headed up by a Voldemort-like leader played by Gísli Örn Garðarsson.
As a foil to Gyllenhaal’s reckless masculinity, the doe-like Gemma Arterton’s Princess Tamina adds an element of sassiness, but not to the extent that Keira Knightley did in Pirates of the Caribbean.
Though Bruckheimer’s stamp of action-packed, visually arresting spectacle truly entertains, it lacks — for want of a better term — the Johnny Depp factor.
Alfred Molina as morally questionable entrepreneur Sheik Amar and Steve Toussaint playing the knife-throwing Seso add some laughs. The pair is particularly effective at providing comic relief in a phenomenal sequence involving, of all things, an ostrich race gone awry. Despite the occasional success of their scenes, they don’t have the same kind of quotable, relatable antics required in such a melodramatic action movie.
The fantastical plot that results from the far-fetched quasi-Persian setting is ridiculous, involving jealousy, intrigue and good old mystical destiny, but because of the wonderfully immersive quality of the world that the director has created, it’s also easily overlooked.
With laughably awkward lines of dialogue that sound much better in video game sequences, unnecessarily operatic romantic moments and numerous slow-motion scenes of Dastan screaming and fighting before walls of fire, Prince of Persia sticks faithfully to the spirit of the video game.
There are even sequences where the camera whooshes around just like a role playing game, changing angles as if the filmmakers were the cosmic player one pressing R2 to change the perspective in the game. It’s a blatant shout-out to nostalgic gamers, and it’s a nice gift to those who still remember when the latest thing in gaming was the vibrating controller, not fancy graphics or motion-capture technology.
All treats for gamers aside, Prince of Persia is still just a fun, fluffy film set to an epic score with enough action sequences to inspire at least three Disney park attractions. Though the film ends with a Star Trek-esque time-rift resolution that leaves the possibility of future movies open, most audiences will have probably had enough pulsing lights and constant motion.
There is such a thing as a ride that is simply too long and Prince of Persia comes close to it. Leaving the audience dizzy, giggling and with a nice jolt of adrenaline, the only thing viewers want to do is promptly get out of the building and shoot through the ride-themed merchandise store.
If there is a sequel in the future, however, it’s doubtful that moviegoers will be too eager to get in line to ride again.

A constitutional policy
Hilary Lazarus’ May 26 article titled “Arizona Law Borders on Ethnic Cleansing” was ignorant and irresponsible. Unfortunately, Lazarus continues to disseminate lies and stoke fear with respect to the Arizona law in particular and the issue of illegal immigration in general. Lazarus’ assertions are incorrect on two very fundamental levels.
First, Lazarus is part of a very vocal minority who continues to inject “race” into an issue that by definition has nothing to do with race and everything to do with rule of law. Thankfully, the majority of Americans still realize that all illegal immigrants of any race, creed or gender are in violation of the law. While there are illegal immigrants in our country from many different nations and many different races, the statistical facts from the United States Justice Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement clearly demonstrate that the majority of illegal immigrants are of Hispanic decent. This fact cannot be defined as racist; it is a geo-political reality.
This results in a “racial” but not a “racist” component to the issue of illegal immigration in the United States. In other words, it is very possible that any crackdown on illegal immigration might result in a disproportionate number of Hispanics being affected. But this is simply because they represent the majority of offenders. Since when should law-abiding Americans apologize for this fact?
The bottom line is that I am personally offended by suggestions that Americans like me who believe in enforcing our immigration policy are racists. Americans who support thorough and strict enforcement of immigration are no more racist than Americans who support traditional marriage are homophobic. It’s a false conclusion drawn on false representation of the facts intended to demonize those with whom one disagrees.
Lazarus is incorrect in a second substantial way that few people seem able to articulate: The bill that was passed in Arizona actually has nothing to do with immigration policy. The Arizona bill has to do with immigration law enforcement. Lazarus and others have built their argument against Arizona on the suggestion that only the federal government can set immigration policy. They are correct, and nothing Arizona has done changes federal immigration policy at all. Instead, the new Arizona law simply says that there will no longer be any sanctuary or safehaven for illegal immigrants in their state. In fact, Arizona is formally and officially saying that they will work with officials in handling the crime of illegal immigration.
The truth is that state and local police agencies work with the federal government in enforcing federal statutes all the time. This local cooperation is essential in genuine and thorough law enforcement at all levels. Arizona hasn’t changed immigration policy at all. Arizona has simply agreed to enforce the law and cooperate with the federal government. If anything, the U.S. Department of Justice should be investigating the constitutionality of large cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco or Miami, which have openly declared “sanctuary” for people here illegally. It’s preposterous that any city in the United States can simply opt out of law enforcement so brazenly. And if Americans truly believe that individual states have no business meddling with policy that is reserved for the federal level, then where is the outrage over states like California setting its own drug policy with respect to marijuana?
In conclusion, I would like to give Lazarus the benefit of the doubt in suggesting that she is merely focusing on the impoverished plight of the many people who come to our country. Unfortunately, she and so many others fail to acknowledge that the United States has one of the most generous and welcoming immigration policies in the world. But we must send a message to the world that we are also a country of law and order. We cannot continue to reward bad behavior or any unlawful conduct.
As Americans, we must first focus on the issues of crime, poverty, education and health care that face those of us who are here legally before we can embrace the suffering of people who begin their American dream by breaking immigration law. And in case anyone reading this opinion would like to dismiss me as a self-righteous, unappreciative American with no concern for human rights, let me mention two things: First, immigration to any country is not a human right. And second, I am actually a first generation immigrant myself, who came to this country from the United Kingdom, who stood in line after line, filling out paperwork and getting fingerprinted, sitting through interviews and paying a variety of fees. I waited my turn and paid my dues. No one should be above the law, and fair-minded Americans should agree.

Jon…Mexicans are not slaves stolen from their homeland and sold into slave labor with no human rights, they are people from another country who cross our borders illegally of their own free will to find money. If you cant make that seperation in your head, just drop out of school as your to stupid to lead anyone in the work force. I am an American of Mexican descent….please, ask me for my papers. Make me prove i am here legally. I do not want illegals flowing across our borders unchecked ruining our economy, and committing wide sprerad crimes . And no, most illegal immigrants do not pay income taxes, they are paid under the counter. California is broke because the libs like Jon just keep handing out tax payer money to those who either dont belong here, or dont contribute, becausee he feels guilty about having money and going to a great school. Get in line and come here legally, we want immigrants, we need immigrants. But the crime and free rides that come with illegal immigration we dont need. Arizona has it right. America and her citizens need to come first. We have to stop giving away the country. Its also easy to see that Hilary Lazarus’  sat in the class rooms that taught that the SW portion of the USA is “occupied territory”, and should be given back to Mexico. Yes, thats is actually being taught.
Congratulations on romanticizing a discriminatory policy! 
 “This results in a “racial” but not a “racist” component to the issue of illegal immigration in the United States.”
> So I suppose that the Jim Crow laws weren’t “racist” because they required “equal” segregation? They were merely racial laws that happened to heighten discrimination. Hmmm doesn’t seem like the relationship between “racist” and “racial” is particularly tenuous. Any law passed on the basis of race enhances discrimination, hence racism. Perhaps you can find me a counterexample? Find me a “racial” law that did not result result in discrimination or blatant antagonism.
Thanks Benjamin for articulating what the majority of Americans believe!
Thank you Benjamin Roberts for your outstanding letter and for writing the truth!
Very true, thanks for shedding truth on the subject.
Well written Benjamin J. Roberts. Rule of Law keeps a society civil. When a law is no longer enforced, it should be removed from the books to keep the law free from the personal preferences of enforcers.
Well said!
It’s so easy to believe a lie…to trust in one’s emotions….to follow a peer group….to try & do the “popular” rebellious thing…THAN TO FACE THE FACTS.
I hate to say it, but USC is becoming just another “One Party Classroom” where only ONE Politically correct position is tolerated.
Truth comes from an open & honest & respectful DEBATE of ideas (not emotions).
And seems that many professors at USC are afraid of the truth & cowardly prefer indoctrination over education.
They need to step down.
