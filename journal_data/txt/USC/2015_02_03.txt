’SC Students for Israel, TAMID, Africa SC and the Environmental Student Assembly are uniting around the common goal of raising awareness for the Innovation: Africa, a nonprofit organization that brings Israeli technology to African villages. Its goal is to provide African villages with three solar panels costing $1,500 in total. So far, Innovation: Africa has provided more than 700,000 people with light, clean water and medical care in Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, Senegal, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The nonprofit installs solar panels to power schools, orphanages, medical clinics and water-pumping systems in Africa. It also provides farmers with drip irrigation technologies.
Jeff Levine, a member of TAMID, explained that bringing Israeli technology to Africa will improve the quality of life.
“Innovation: Africa seeks to use the Israeli entrepreneurial spirit to find new and efficient ways to help people get their electricity, clean water and sanitation needs,” Levine wrote in an email. “Israeli technology is at the heart of what Innovation: Africa does.”
Maya Fried, co-president of ’SC Students for Israel, stated that she was motivated to help Innovation: Africa because she is always on the lookout for initiatives that bring the lesser-known parts of Israel to other communities.
“Israel is innovating and changing the way we use technology,” Fried wrote in an email.
The similarity of Israel’s terrain to that of Africa has allowed Israel to develop such technologies, and there are numerous populations of Ethiopians, Sudanese and Eritreans emigrating to Israel.
Fried feels compelled to provide technologies to African villages, because “it’s so close to home, both literally and figuratively.”
Africa SC joined the initiative in hopes of providing electricity to African communities.
Shae Aremu, president of Africa SC, said the conditions of many African communities are very poor.
“Often, they do not have consistent electricity or running water. Sometimes they don’t have the power or energy to run facilities,” Aremu said. “We are endeavoring to provide solar panels because these villages have little access to resources or money that would enable them to power their homes, schools or businesses.”
The Environmental Student Assembly looks forward to the installment of the solar panels because it will provide communities with a sustainable source of energy.
“There is no pollution once the solar panels are installed,” Jinny Choi, the director of university outreach for ESA, wrote in an email. “So it’s also considered a clean energy.”
This campaign is unique in that it encompasses four student organizations with different missions working for the same objective.
Members agree that it has been a rewarding experience.
“It was an incredible opportunity to help further Innovation: Africa’s mission to bring sustainable tech solutions to African communities in need,” Danielle Fallon, the vice president of TAMID, said.
Fried said that she hopes collaborations between student organizations such as this continue in the future.
“We are doing this together in emulation of how Innovation: Africa and global aid works. Hopefully these collaborations will only lead to similar events in the future, and I cannot wait for the next project to present itself,” Fried said.
In order to raise the money to buy the solar panels, the organizations will hold an event at Nature’s Brew at 7 p.m. this Wednesday. Bazar Ensemble will perform at the events and all proceeds will go to Innovation: Africa.

A competency hearing for Andrew Garcia, one of the four defendants accused in the July murder of engineering graduate student Xinran Ji, failed to reach a conclusion Tuesday morning at the Los Angeles Mental Health Courthouse.
Garcia’s attorney filed a request for a mental health evaluation after Garcia interrupted court proceedings with an outburst.
During the competency hearing on Tuesday, Garcia’s public defender requested a comprehensive mental report.
In Tuesday’s hearing, the judge ordered another competency hearing to be held on March 17.
Rose Tsai, the Ji family’s attorney, said Ji’s parents hope that the request is denied so a trial for their son’s murder can proceed.
“We are hoping that won’t happen because for the victim’s family, it just means more waiting, more frustration,” Tsai said. “So hopefully that won’t happen, but if it does happen, unfortunately it means at least for the time being, he won’t be able, according to the argument of his attorney or his own argument … to face the trial at this time. But it does not mean that he does not need to face the trial ever. He will still need to face the trial sooner or later, but it’s just a matter of delay tactics.”
The results of the mental health evaluation would only account for Garcia’s mental state at the present time and would not dictate his mental state at the time of the crime. The evaluation would impact Garcia’s ability to stand trial and could potentially prolong the length of trial proceedings.
Tsai also said that Ji’s parents hope the defendants are convicted and given tough sentences to send a message about the severity of the crime committed against their son.
“The other humble hope is that they don’t wish to have that kind of tragedy happen to anyone else’s child, so they are hoping the community can really pay attention to Xinran’s case,” Tsai said. “And hopefully through obtaining the most severe punishment [for] the defendants, it will give a message to our society and our community, which we all treasure and all want to be safe.”
Andrew Garcia was not present at the case’s preliminary hearing in January, but the three other defendants in the case, Jonathan DelCarmen, Alberto Ochoa and Alejandra Guerrero, were present and charged with Ji’s murder.
According to Tsai, the judge said there was “overwhelmingly sufficient evidence” for the prosecution to file charges against all three defendants. Their arraignment is scheduled for March 5.

USC Program Board hosted a diversity debate among the presidential candidates on Tuesday to foster student discussion and awareness of various diversity issues on campus. The debate included questions from Program Board assemblies.
The presidential tickets, Rini Sampath and Jordan Fowler, and Providence Ilisevich and Ehren Elder, participated in the debate.
Program Board assemblies,  Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly, Environmental Student Assembly, Queer and Ally Student Assembly, International Student Assembly and Academic-Culture Student Assembly, as well as individuals representing the Student Coalition of Labor Exploitation, students of low socio-economic status and Disability Services and Programs, submitted questions about diversity issues of interest to them while Co-Directors of Diversity Affairs, Levi Powell and Skylar Dunn moderated the debate.
Many of the Program Board assemblies based their questions on specific programs the candidates plan to implement. These programs focus on creating stronger inclusion of minority groups on campus.
Sampath and Fowler expressed the need for more direct dialogue between Program Board groups and the administration.
Their platform is to provide gender-neutral bathrooms for LGBT students, cultural spaces for different ethnic groups on campus and an integration program that pairs international students with a Los Angeles native for a smoother transition into the USC community.
Sampath discussed the importance of not only having a diverse campus but also creating an inclusive environment which utilizes that diversity to benefit the university.
“USC can boost the most vibrant international student assembly and we can say we have the highest number of diverse students here,” Sampath said. “We can provide all these statistics to back up those declarations but, in all honestly it’s not a diverse campus if students don’t feel included in the conversation, if they don’t feel empowered and if they don’t feel they are accepted and understood. “
Ilisevich and Elder want to meet with student leaders and their respective organizations on a personal level and provide better methods of inclusion starting as early as orientation.
“Diversity and accepting diversity is about understanding, appreciation and respect,” Ilisevich said.  “Different experiences students have give them a value on this campus and we want them to feel that value.”
This was the third annual diversity debate, providing candidates with an opportunity to specifically address programs they feel are most important in terms of diversity.
USG feels the debate is necessary as candidates are representing the entire student body and many students expressed interest in knowing what the candidates plan to do to advocate for their specific groups.
Associate Director of Elections and Recruitment Kandace London has been working with Program Board to put on a smooth event as this election is already considered to be one of the most competitive in years.
“If you’re not from a particular race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or even gender you may not be aware of certain things because those are not the daily struggles that you face,” London said. “Regardless of whoever will win or lose, people are seeing that the candidates want to be engaged in campus and they want to make a change.”
Voting begins Feb. 10 and ends Feb. 12 at 8 p.m.
Voting can be conducted online or at any of the following locations: Tommy Trojan, Parkside IRC, Leavey Library, Lyon Center, Finger Fountain, Engineering Quad and Cultural Centers.

The No. 3 ranked Women of Troy (2-0) will look to follow up their successful opening weekend at the UCLA Invitational with a good showing at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The U.S. Women’s National Team will come to Troy for a scrimmage on Wednesday evening.
Losing a bulk of their senior leadership and scoring to graduation last spring, this young Trojan squad will look to gain some experience when playing this friendly.
Led by senior captain and First Team All-American Monica Vavic, the Women of Troy have a number of weapons on the roster. Vavic leads the team with already 14 goals through just two games, while sophomores Stephania and Ioanna Haralabidis punched in eight goals each.
Even the newcomers did their part over the weekend; seven new players scored in the first two matchups, and freshman goalie Victória Chamorro racked up nine saves in her first two showings in the cage for USC.
Coach Vavic has always had high expectations for his freshmen.
“This is a very good class,” Vavic said, “I think we have some serious water polo players here — girls who are most likely going to continue playing polo after college.”
The connection has been strong between the underclassmen and the upperclassmen even before the season started.
“I think the chemistry with this team is very good,” Vavic said “We have, I think, good leadership. I think that the younger girls are very respectful and are hungry, and the youth of the team is more connected for whatever reason than it was last year. The chemistry between the freshmen and the seniors last year was good but this year, it’s great.”
Wednesday’s scrimmage will be preparation for the upcoming Triton Invitational at UC San Diego starting on Feb. 7, where USC will start off with a match-up against Cal State East Bay at 8:30 a.m. PST.

It’s not quite as important as the Super Bowl. Though the association is easy given how close they fall on the calendar, it’s not like a championship is actually won today. It probably feels like Christmas morning for college head coaches — when they find out whether they got the shiny new toy they wanted all year, or coal — walk-ons. But much like my attitude toward the consumerist nature of the holidays, I don’t like the objectification of student-athletes, so I won’t make that comparison either.
Instead, I’ll say that today is the start of a very early Welcome Week for Trojan fans. Today is National Signing Day — the day we can start to search, follow and Facebook stalk a group of our next classmates. They’ll be the life of the party every Saturday in the fall, part of a cooler fraternity with a more grueling pledge process than the most exclusive houses on The Row; we’ll secretly Snapchat the back of their heads if we are so lucky to be in class with any of them.
The Trojans already have a great list of commits before today’s deadline for high school seniors to sign. Twenty-one recruits have already signed national letters of intent with USC, and 13 of those recruits are on ESPN’s Top 300 recruiting list. The list is currently headlined by Chuma Edoga, one of the top-ranked offensive linemen, out of Powder Springs, Georgia, and Ronald Jones II, ESPN’s top-ranked running back, from McKinney, Texas.
The question for coach Steve Sarkisian is if he can close out local talent on the final day as well as he did last year. Sarkisian’s first major accomplishment as the head coach of the Trojans was getting five-star recruits and Southern California products Adoree’ Jackson, Damien Mama and JuJu Smith to all commit to USC. All three featured prominently in this past season—Mama as a starting offensive lineman, JuJu Smith as one of the team’s best receiving targets and Jackson a cornerback with some time as a receiver and special teams threat—proving the importance of strong recruiting.
The biggest potential target left undecided on the Trojan’s list is Iman Marshall, a five-star cornerback out of Long Beach Polytechnic. Though he doesn’t have the classic apostrophe in his first name like Jackson or Su’a Cravens, the star             defensiveback/linebacker hybrid who committed two years ago and is going into his junior season, Marshall certainly would fit right in with those two and make up maybe the best secondary in the country.
Speaking of the All-Name Team — which is actually a list on the Sports Illustrated website — I would be really excited if the Trojans could land commitments from either Soso Jamabo, a running back/all-around athlete from Plano, Texas, or Equanimeous St. Brown, a receiver from Servite High School in Anaheim. Not only would I get a kick out of hearing those names on the loudspeakers at the Coliseum after plays, but Jamabo is apparently leaning towards UCLA and St. Brown’s mom wants him to pick Stanford, so stealing those commitments from conference rivals would be great.
On a more serious note, National Signing Day serves as a chance to validate Sarkisian’s first calendar year as the director of the program. Contrary to some national commentators or columnists for this publication, I still have full faith in Sarkisian leading this program forward. His in-game decision-making has come into question, but I give criticism of that very little weight, and I think he should be judged much more by the general progress of the program.
The biggest complaint was that overly cautious strategy cost the team in one-possession games. Those detractors seem to forget that SC won more one-possession games — Stanford, Arizona, Cal and Nebraska — as it lost — Boston College, Arizona State and Utah. The Boston College loss had more to do with pregame preparation than late-game strategy, but not even the legendary Pete Carroll could figure that out how to keep his team mentally an edge above an opponent every single week. If you really want to blame the Hail Mary loss to ASU on the coaching staff, then you probably didn’t watch the replay enough times.
Speaking of the legendary Pete Carroll, the Super Bowl this weekend goes to show how hard certain           in-game decisions are and how easily the execution of those plays can skew the media’s judgment on the strategy of those decisions.
Nobody would argue that he isn’t fit to lead the Seahawks. He turned around a USC program into a national title winner, then he did the same thing in Seattle. In 20/20 hindsight, yes, he should have overruled his offensive coordinator’s pass call, but it was not a completely irrational decision not to run it on the goal line. The Patriots had stacked the line of scrimmage to protect against the run, the Seahawks had single coverage with a rookie cornerback and nobody would have guessed that that rookie would make a game-saving interception. In fact, there’s a great article on ESPN’s          FiveThirtyEight.com sports statistics blog saying that statistically speaking, Patriots coach Bill Belichick’s decision not to call a timeout the play before the interception was even more irrational than Carroll’s call to throw, but “winning erases all sin.”
The most common explanation for the Trojans’ struggles this year has been the lack of depth from recruiting sanctions—which honestly explains a lot of the conservative strategy used by Sarkisian. But for the first time in years, USC can finally recruit a full class and offer 25 scholarships. This really should make a huge difference for the program in the next couple of years, and we should even see the fruits of it this year, with some writers projecting that USC will finish in the Top 4 and make the playoffs next year.
With four open scholarships still on the table, signing day should be a very exciting day for the Trojans. The NCAA has tested the patience of fans for a long time, but the Trojan Family may finally be rewarded with a consistent national contender. The Trojan recruiting class is ranked No. 6 by ESPN, but I think that will climb by the end of the day.
Maybe today really is Christmas for USC fans. And we can really celebrate it this year, because finally, we’re off the NCAA’s naughty list.

With National Signing Day on Wednesday, the Trojan faithful are hopeful to seal the signatures of several top high school recruits.
The Trojans welcome   linebacker/defensive end Porter Gustin from Salem Hills High School in Utah, who brings plenty of athleticism and size to front seven. His strengths include instincts, eye discipline, tackling ability, pass rush and block shedding.  At 6-foot-5 and 245 pounds, his size enables him to be utilized as both a linebacker and defensive end, and will allow the Trojans to pressure opposing quarterbacks, lockdown short to intermediate passing routes, as well as play stout defense against the run.
His coverage skills could use some fine-tuning as he looks a bit stiff and lacks fluidity in coverage, but this could be attributed to him still growing. Gustin is a highly rated prospect with a college-ready body who could provide great depth for a Trojan defense continuing to transition into a 3-4 defensive scheme.  Gustin chose the Trojans Tuesday over Arizona State and Ohio State, who each made a late push for his talents.
Iman Marshall is one of the most college-ready cornerbacks in the 2015 class. He is a very physical athlete with great size, standing at 6-foot-2, and has the ability to lock down sides of the field.  Marshall excels at jamming receivers off the line to disrupt the timing between the quarterback and the receiver. Additionally, Marshall has great instincts, ball skills and is a    more-than-willing tackler. Furthermore he plays the position with an unquestionable swagger in which he competes and does not shy away from competition.  Some areas of improvement include keeping leverage against opposing wide outs and being too physical with opposing receivers, especially in the Pac-12 where college referees are often eager  to call penalties.  However, with solid Division I coaching, he very well could make an immediate impact for the Trojans, who lead the Wolverines of Michigan, the Seminoles of Florida State and the crosstown Bruins of UCLA for Marshall’s commitment.
Rasheem Green, a defensive line prospect out of USC feeder school Junipero Serra, is anticipated to follow former high school teammates Adoree’ Jackson and Marqise Lee to USC. Green is a mobile 300 pounder with the ability to collapse the pocket and stifle running games. Green’s strengths include his length,    first-step quickness, and ability to shed blockers. With the departure of Leonard Williams, and a showdown against perennial power Alabama looming in 2016, the commitment of a five-star prospect Green is crucial to the Trojan’s plans along the defensive line.
Also from Junipero Serra is Green’s teammate, John Houston. Another athletic linebacker prospect, Houston has the ability to cover receivers, backs and tight ends, which is a real commodity in the Pac-12, where teams tend to spread the field and air it out.  Houston’s length and speed are also impressive; he should transition well to the college game with his ability to run sideline to sideline and contain short passes and runs. If Houston hits the weight room with some vigor, he is slotted to be an effective and versatile linebacker for the Trojans.  Houston, a four-star prospect, looks to continue the strong USC pipeline from Serra.
National Signing Day is tomorrow, and these recruits will reveal which university they will attend.

Behind only the defending national champions in the national poll, the undefeated men’s volleyball team is off to its hottest start in 24 years. After closing out a two-game home stand last week without dropping a set, the team will fly to Honolulu today for two matches against Hawai’i.
The No. 2 Trojans (7-0, 6-0 MPSF), who defeated Long Beach State last Wednesday in three sets then swept Cal State Northridge Friday, can maintain a lock on first place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings if they can come back with two more victories.
No. 6 Hawai’i (6-2, 3-1) lost both matches to USC last year, taking only one set during the Rainbow Warriors’ trip out to Los Angeles. Head coach Bill Ferguson said it will be crucial for the Trojans to control the energy during the road trip because Hawai’i plays very well in front of its home crowd.
“Hawai’i at home is an almost entirely different team than on the road,” Ferguson said. “It’s the best volleyball crowd in America, bar none. They really get behind their team and give them a lift. They’re good for about three points a set.”
Despite entering slightly hostile territory on the court, it will still be a nice homecoming for senior setter Micah Christenson, freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta and redshirt junior middle blocker Tyler Cundiff       — all Honolulu natives.
The last time the Trojans were in Hawaii they dropped both matches in five sets. In both matches, the Trojans took the first two sets and dominated for most of the third, but it wasn’t enough to match Hawai’i and their support from their home crowd.
“Hawai’i fans are so loyal, so helpful to that team,” Christenson said. “They really feed off of it.”
Ferguson added that, much like the Trojans, the Rainbow Warriors serve very aggressively and a key to the game will be who can receive serves better.
“Hawai’i has some guys that can really get after it from the service line. We’ve been able to pass well and we’re going to need to against Hawai’i because they can serve the daylights out of the ball.”
Tuileta and Hawai’i’s sophomore outside hitter Kupono Fey were high school teammates, earning two state championships and two Interscholastic League of Honolulu titles together at Punahou in three years. This will be the first time that the two match up on the court for their respective universities; it will definitely be a change from the time the two were dominating the net for Punahou.
The Trojans’ offense, run by redshirt sophomore Christopher Orenic, senior middle blocker Robert Feathers and junior outside hitter Alex Slaught, continues to dominate the net so much so that other teams just can’t seem to contain them. They are averaging 12.9 kills per set with an attack percentage of .323, while holding their opponents to an average of 10.2 kills per set and .166 hitting percentage.
In accord with the season, the Trojans are averaging 1.6 aces per set. Christenson continues to dominate the serving with 14 aces on the season averaging .54 per set. The dominance from the back line proves successful for the Trojans.
Hawai’i currently sits in fourth place in MPSF standings. Hawai’i took both matches from UC Santa Barbara at home in four sets then split matches at UC Irvine, winning one in four sets but losing one in straight sets.
The Rainbow Warriors are led by junior outside hitter Sinisa Zarkovic, senior opposite Brook Sedore and redshirt senior middle blocker Taylor Averill on offense. As a team, Hawai’i averages 13.2 kills per set — more than the Trojans — but their opponents average 13.6 kills per set, which should benefit the Trojans. They also have an average attack percentage of .308, while their opponents average an attack percentage of .287.
Similar to USC, Hawai’i also has success from the service line, averaging 1.1 aces per set. Ferguson pointed out that it will be important for USC to be balanced and focus on passing the ball well, like they’ve been doing recently.
“Hawai’i has some guys that can really go after it,” Ferguson said. “They can serve the daylights out of the ball.”
The Trojans won at UC Irvine in five sets earlier this year but have not yet hit Santa Barbara. UC Irvine is tied for fourth in MPSF standings with Hawai’i, and BYU and Pepperdine are tied for second place at 5-1. Pepperdine’s only conference loss was at USC in four sets earlier this year and BYU will come to town for two matches next week.
The top eight teams in the conference will qualify for the MPSF tournament, with the order of seeding determining home-court advantage. The winner of the MPSF tournament will automatically qualify for the NCAA tournament. One automatic qualifier from each of the four Division I conferences will earn a tournament bid and two at large bids will be given.
Last year, the Trojans finished 14-10 in the conference, grabbing the last spot in the MPSF tournament. However, they were eliminated by BYU, the regular season winner of the conference, in the first round of the tournament. BYU went on to win the tournament, while Stanford, runner-up in the tournament, grabbed one of the at-large bids. Loyola-Chicago, the only team the Trojans currently trail in the national poll, went on to win the national title.
Last week, Cal State Northridge (4-5, 2-3 MPSF) came to the Galen Center unranked in the American Volleyball Coaches Association Top 15 national poll. However, the Matadors were one of three unranked teams receiving votes in the poll. In the most recent poll, the Matadors were still unranked but receiving votes. The Matadors currently sit in seventh place in the MPSF standings.
The Matadors upset the Trojans last year at home, winning in straight sets. The Trojans returned the favor when they hosted the Matadors and also won in three sets.
Ferguson compared the team’s performance to that of the Seattle Seahawks under former USC football coach Pete Carroll, saying the Trojans kept a simple game plan but executed really well on defense.
“We didn’t do anything complicated,” he said. “You listen to Coach Carroll talk about the Seahawks, they talk about doing their thing, and tonight that was us. We didn’t throw a whole lot of different stuff at them, we were just really good at reading what they were doing and getting in front of their attackers as blockers and really affecting what they were doing.”
The Trojans honored two former Players of the Year, Tom Duke (1988) and Bryan Ivie (1990, 1991), after the match by retiring their jerseys. Both were members of the 1988 national championship team and Ivie won a second national title in 1990. Duke holds the record for the highest hitting percentage in a game with .941. Ivie holds the record for most career kills with 2,380, single season kills with 770, career blocks with 661 and single season blocks with 199. Ivie also won a bronze medal with the U.S. national team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
On Saturday, the Trojans honored Bob Yoder, former player and head coach for the Trojans, at the second annual “Ernie Event” in the Founders Room of the Galen Center. Yoder won the national championship as a player in 1977 then was the head coach of the 1988 national championship winning team. Yoder’s nephews Lucas and Jack are both sophomores on the 2015 team. The Ernie Event is named after legendary former men’s volleyball coach Ernie Hix.
The first match against Hawai’i is today at 10 p.m. local time, 7 p.m. Hawaiian time. The two teams play again at the same time on Friday.

Lil Wayne has been the focus of a lot of controversy over the last few weeks. His feud with former mentor Bryan “Birdman” Williams over the delayed release of his newest album Tha Carter V could now be heading toward a lawsuit, and any good will the two formerly great friends had seems to be gone. Lil Wayne’s most recent mixtape, “Sorry 4 the Wait 2,” is meant to hold fans over until the conflict can be worked out, but through the tension has come one of the strongest showings Lil Wayne has had in years mainly because he is rapping for a reason again.
Just a Lil’ taste · “Sorry 4 The Wait 2” is a mixtape released by New Orleans rapper Lil’ Wayne while disputes with former mentor Bryan “Birdman” Williams delay the release of his next album Tha Carter V. – Photo courtesy of Young Money
Born Dwayne Carter, Lil Wayne is a veteran of the rap scene who has generated hits on a steady basis since his days in rap group Hot Boys in 1996, when he was just 15. He has stayed relevant enough to be on his fifth Tha Carter album, releasing more than just a few albums in between. He’s released an album from prison, I Am Not a Human Being, that one critic called “downright astonishing considering the circumstances.” Much of Wayne’s success can be attributed to the direction of mentor Birdman and the support of his label Cash Money records, but the feud is now jeopardizing his affiliation with Cash Money as well as a longstanding friendship.
Recently, XXL magazine posted a throwback article from when the two dropped their collaborative album, Like Father Like Son, in 2006. The article features previous issues that many members of Cash Money had with Birdman, and the fact that without Lil Wayne, the label would have gone bankrupt following a dispersal of almost all of its original members. Most of all, however, the article focuses on the close relationship between Lil Wayne and Birdman. Lil Wayne saw the latter as a father figure and openly displayed affection in very warm terms.
“[Cash Money Records] made artists. It wasn’t no such thing as coming there and you already had a style. It was you became somebody. You could be whoever you was before you came there, but you came out Cash Money,” said Wayne in the article about his label, which has since reinstated itself as a hip-hop dynasty and signed artists like Tyga, DJ Khaled and Nicki Minaj.
If someone were to show Wayne the article today, it would most likely end poorly for said individual.
“Sorry 4 the Wait 2” features Wayne rapping line after line about his anger toward Cash Money and Birdman. He references a hit squad to take out the producer multiple times and swears off previous affiliation with the label. All animosity aside, however, Lil Wayne sounds crisp on this mixtape in a way that he hasn’t sounded in years. He has purpose and drive, and it feels as though he is actually rapping to rap instead of rapping for the money.
The backing tracks come from some of the hottest tracks in the last year and a half, including O.T. Genesis’s “Coco,” Beyonce’s “Drunk in Love,” Rae Sremmurd’s “No Type” and OG Maco’s “You Guessed It,” which is a core aspect of Wayne’s mixtapes. The features are also solid, especially considering the speed with which this mixtape was produced. Used as a bridge between Wayne’s last album and his newest, “Sorry 4 the Wait 2” still has some A-list names, notably rapper Drake and the infamous 2Chainz. RiFF RAFF — famously known for his ridiculousness — also appears on the album in a rant about Drake, the feud and the mixtape itself, in classic RiFF RAFF gibberish fashion.
Common themes aside from the Wayne-Birdman beef are codeine, money and growing up in the ghetto, all reminiscent of an older Lil Wayne.
“The groaners-per-minute ratio here is lower than usual, and this is likely due to the fact Wayne’s got more than just bad sex puns on his mind,” said Pitchfork writer Renato Pagnani in reviewing the new mixtape. Without choosing sides, it is somewhat easy to make the case that this feud is exactly what Wayne needed to center himself.
For a few years now, Wayne has been on a downhill slide. He has received mixed reviews for his most recent album I Am Not A Human Being II as well as his being dropped by sponsor Pepsi among a slew of radio duds. This year though, Wayne has been part of two of the biggest radio hits, “Only” and “Truffle Butter,” both featuring Drake and Nicki Minaj.
Lil Wayne has now dropped a mixtape. He has hinted at dropping one more and is ready to release his newest album as soon as he is able to. The fight between Wayne and his mentor seems unhealthy and is on its way to reaching irreparable levels, but Birdman denying the artist his money might have been just what Wayne needed.
Lil Wayne was losing touch with his music, and for a while it did seem like he was only doing it for the money. Take that out of the equation, and you get fresh lyrics, a strong attitude and an impressive resurgence from one of the longest still-relevant rappers today. Be on the lookout for Tha Carter V, another mixtape entitled “Dedication 6,” and a lot more from the youngest veteran in the game, Lil Wayne.

Recent, terrible, acts of violence in the news have jumpstarted a serious dialogue about the role weapons play in our culture.   USC student Justin Finuliar has thrown his hat into the conversation with his recently completed art exhibit, “Weaponized,” featured on the first floor of Watt Hall.
The exhibit consisted of five different installations all looking at a different aspects of weaponry and violence. Though it just recently concluded, Finuliar is not done with the exhibit and hopes to display it at the Fisher Museum next to continue examining these themes. He wanted to look at both the positive and the negative aspects of the place weapons hold in our culture.
“What I really wanted to focus on was a snapshot of how Americans feel,” Finuliar said. “The dichotomy of how we want stronger regulation and how we want everybody to be safe in America and on the other side weapons culture is still here, and is very much embedded in American culture as well. I didn’t really want to choose a side because I feel that Americans really haven’t done so cohesively as a nation.”
The installation that first grabs the visitor’s eye upon entering the exhibit is what looks like a weapons rack against the back wall. In “3D Printed Armory” There are weapons of all different sizes and types hanging up against a metal installation. There are machine guns, grenades, nunchucks and tridents. These were all made through the process of 3D printing. Each weapon takes hours to print, but it’s worth it: the replicas, despite their fragility, are very realistic. Finuliar found the designs for the majority of these weapons online and was able to print them without designing them himself. The most engaging aspect of Finuliar’s exhibit is that it is interactive. Every weapon is made with magnetic, easily detachable components. Visitors can take parts from the nunchucks, the grenade and a battle ax and create their own unique weapons. The piece sparks thought about the components of weapons and what makes them dangerous as well as fascinating.
“I wanted the viewer to have a very interactive experience by going up to this wall where everything has been created for the same purpose and then creating their own,” Finuliar said. “Alluding to the madness and absurdity of creating more weapons when you already have so many that accomplish that purpose.”
Another interesting exhibit was “Be a Hero,” a recreation of the Arthurian sword-in-stone myth. A sword was set into a 700-pound block of concrete in the middle of the installation. Guests were invited to attempt to remove the sword as in the Arthurian legend where the one who removed the sword would be the true heir to the throne of Camelot. A live feed was set up so that others could watch the people’s attempts, all unsuccessful, to remove the sword. “It symbolizes to how a specific object, in this case a sword, was designed for a specific purpose. But over time it developed into a symbol for power, royalty, the right to rule,” Finuliar said. “With the interactive aspect, I really wanted to elicit the feeling of wanting to be the person of importance of being the hero and trying to get the sword out. And then on top of that how today’s culture tries to highlight individual achievements through social media.”
The next exhibit is “Falling Arrows,” a series of 120 ceramic arrows all set up on a wall to create the illusion of raining down on a particular spot. The exhibit creates an interesting juxtaposition between these inherently threatening pieces of weaponry and the actual fragility that they exhibit when they are made of something as brittle as ceramic and shaped into thin shapes. Finuliar says that the arrows crack just by being picked up too quickly. The fragility of the arrows, positioned in such a classic, threatening arrangement creates a powerful juxtaposition.
The next work is a three-piece series of ready-mades titled “D.I.Y. 1-3” These are weapons made out of everyday objects. They look absurd upon first glance; for example, “D.I.Y. #3” is a flame-thrower made out of a squirt gun, a lighter and tank of gas. These make a very interesting point about how certain items are illegal and stigmatized as weapons but are not, in essence, different from everyday items. This exhibit makes the argument that it is not the weapon that is the cause for violence, but rather, people who have intent to cause violence.
Finally, there is the piece “Every 20 Minutes.” This exhibit is based upon a CDC statistic that three people die from a gunshot in the United States every hour. In one corner of the exhibit hall, a machine drops a bullet onto a pile every 20 minutes. This can be directly observed or heard from a distance recreating the experience that gun violence is experienced very differently in close proximity as opposed to a removed position.  It is a meaningful piece to round out the collection.
All in all, “Weaponized” is a very unique exhibit. With only five pieces, Finuliar is able to make some very deep and well thought out observations about gun culture and weapons in general and include the visitors in the dialogue as well. The experience is quite something, especially considering global acts of violence that have happened in the past few years. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.

Campus sexual assault is obviously a national epidemic. Despite recent measures to investigate sexual assault cases at many universities, including USC, and California’s fairly recent passage of “Yes Means Yes” legislation, there appeared to be no definitive answers to the problem. Fortunately, the handling of Stanford University’s recent sexual assault case reveals a possible solution. Though the assault’s occurrence shows we are still nowhere near the end of this battle, the legal response to the situation sets a respectable standard for addressing campus rape.
The attack in question took place at Stanford in the early hours of Jan. 18. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, two graduate students who were biking stopped and called the police when they saw the assailant — freshman athlete Brock Allen Turner — on top of an unconscious woman. The students called the police and then physically restrained Turner until authorities arrived at the scene. Turner was arrested and subsequently charged with five felony counts. As if this level of adjudicating competence were not unusual enough for a campus sexual assault, Turner withdrew from the university, despite his athletic talent.
It is bizarre in itself that this case has yielded actual consequences for the assailant, but what really sets this particular incident apart is the involvement of law enforcement professionals. Instead of reporting the incident to campus authorities, the witnesses contacted local police directly. The Daily Beast points out that “while counseling services and other resources for victims of rape and assault can almost certainly always be improved, it’s a mistake to make university officials the main investigators, let alone judge and juror.” After all, university adjudication often serves to muddle the due process of the accused and fails to provide victims with sufficient support and protection. The situation is not always clear-cut, as definitive witnesses and clear visibility are rare in such cases, but dealing directly with the law prevents image-conscious universities, which includes most if not all institutions of higher education, from having their judgments influenced by fears of a tarnished reputation. We cannot eradicate campus sexual assault until perpetrators assume full responsibility — in the eyes of the law and society as a whole. Because so many cases of campus sexual assault are swept under the rug or mishandled, this one stands out for its proper adjudication. On the other hand, public reactions to this case have revealed America’s deep-seated misogyny. Chronicle writer Kurtis Alexander reports that students were utterly unsurprised that “a star athlete [had] been accused of raping an unconscious woman outside a campus party.” Alexander quotes Stanford student Hannah Abolos, who commented that she was “surprised and also not surprised,” since “[t]here’s a lot of things in the party culture that are conducive to this.”
Abolos’ sentiments reflect the common misconception that alcohol and party culture are responsible for sexual assault. A controversial October 2013 report from USA Today stated that alcohol is the most common date rape drug. As CNN’s Matthew C. Whitaker stated, “[w]arning women about heavy drinking places the burden of not being sexually assaulted squarely on the shoulders of victims, and when they are raped this twisted dynamic often leads them to blame themselves.” Indeed, women appear to be disproportionately saddled with unprecedented repercussions of their drinking; Alexander’s Chronicle article reveals a glaring double standard in the words of Stanford junior Kimberly Kreb:
“If you’re a guy, you can go out and drink all you want and the worst you end up with is a hangover. If you’re a woman, you have to assess.”
This double standard reveals the biggest stumbling block for those working to eradicate campus rape. Victim-blaming harms the offended party and absolves assailants from their full share of public disdain — even if they’ve been arrested. Whitaker likens “blaming women for their own sexual assault, no matter how much they drank”, to blaming “someone who left their keys in their car for the theft of their vehicle.” He asks readers, “Is leaving your keys in your car unwise? Yes. Is it the cause of your car being stolen? No. The person who stole your car is the responsible one. Besides, they do not need your keys to take your car.” Indeed, it is always best to be on your guard, but if someone is intent on harming another person, alcohol is not the determining factor.
Efficient legal handling is a step in the right direction, but deciding whether to report a rape to the police or university officials would not be an issue if campus assault weren’t so rampant. Rape is a matter of power — an assertion of archaic ideas of masculinity. Until society reconsiders its notions of gender and places 100 percent of the blame on the attackers, campus sexual assault will never cease. Changes to university protocol will not hurt, but campus sexual assault — and sexual assault in general — will not disappear until society stamps out misogyny for good.

Since the Jezebel article pertaining to USC Alpha Chi Omega’s Rush Email surfaced, members not affiliated with the Panhellenic community have used the information to reaffirm their opinions on the “superficial Greek system.” After reading the Daily Trojan’s recent article “Alpha Chi Omega’s standards create unhealthy images” by Sonali Seth, I felt the issue needed to be approached from a new light. 
I’ll admit, sorority recruitment is no cake walk, and some of the traditions of USC Panhellenic are rather silly, but this email is no more than a “dress for success” PSA.
Though on the surface Panhellenic recruitment looks like a week-long exercise in hair-flipping and sorority songs, at the core, it should be treated as an interview. One wouldn’t show up to a college admission or job interview in sweatpants, a ratty t-shirt, and a messy bun in her hair, and the interviewer would not do so either.
When there are 10 other houses that those potential new members, or PNMs, can choose from, active members want to reflect their house in the most positive way possible. Just because tidy hair, fresh makeup, and a chic wardrobe are a means of making that mark doesn’t mean our community is, first and foremost, one that focuses on superficial qualities. The notions of looking presentable that are apparent in the email from Alpha Chi Omega are just a fraction, a first step even, of what goes on during a values-based recruitment. Call it superficial, we call it making a good first impression.
If you do a simple Google Search of “What to wear for an interview,” you’ll come across a Forbes article titled “How to Dress for Your Next Job Interview.” In a list of necessities for a successful interview, it states: 
“Pay attention to your grooming as much as your outfit, Strong says. “Your hair should be neat, and fingernails should be clean,” Ferguson Hodges adds. You want to look nicely kempt from head to toe.”
Neat hair and clean fingernails, looking nicely kempt from head to toe…ring any bells?
The Daily Trojan article notes a study that apparently concluded that women only need 20 seconds to pass judgment on other women. Last time I checked, it takes more than twenty seconds to engage in a meaningful conversation, and we have many of them with PNMs. And while physical appearances may draw initial interest from PNMs, it’s definitely not the foundation of our sisterhoods within the Panhellenic community.
Also, we are not conformists for wearing “matching tank tops with Greek letters,” as the DT article stated, or generally being proud to represent an organization. No one condemns other clubs on campus for wearing t-shirts bearing their logo, so why do sororities face this criticism?
Making generalizations that “physical appearance appears to precede intelligence, integrity, compassion and sisterly bonding as criteria for a being sorority sister,” is in and of itself a closed-minded reflection of this process. As someone that has gone through recruitment as a PNM and active member, recruiting new members is a more holistic experience than the public stereotype, and the Daily Trojan, like to give it credit. 
As a PNM in 2013, I was most comfortable in houses where I really clicked with the girls and could steer the conversation away from the typical “where are you from?” and “wow I love your dress!” and “don’t you just love Disneyland??” Each house had something different to offer, and were excited to share details about their philanthropies, gifted members, and other aspects of their sisterhood. 
At Alpha Chi Omega in particular, I remember having an extensive conversation with a girl who was very passionate about the house’s philanthropy, which helps women dealing with domestic violence. She told me about the different events they host throughout the year and how members regularly visit a local women’s shelter to donate goods and hang out with the women. Personally, that doesn’t sound to me like an organization that ranks physical appearance over integrity and compassion.
On the other side of recruitment as a member of USC Tri Delta, we do our best to make the process more significant than awkward small talk and a zealous song and dance as PNMs exit. Although the best conversations I had weren’t necessarily ones that discussed serious and relevant topics (though those did make a good impression), the ones that mattered the most were ones I would actually have with someone I would be friends with. For example, I talked to one girl about our mutual fear of roller coasters because as kids, we were both tricked into going on the Jurassic Park ride at Universal Studios. And you know what? She’s a Tri Delt now.
During recruitment we make sure that every PNM knows that our philanthropy nationally is St. Jude. In fact, most of us can’t shut up about it because we’re so proud to be a part of an organization that has pledged the most money to St. Jude in the history of the hospital. For anyone that’s wondering, that’s $60 million dollars over the next 10 years, and based on our sorority’s track record with monetary pledges, we will hit that mark in eight. 
The Panhellenic community is very proud that the average GPA for USC Panhellenic is 3.31, .15 points higher than the overall undergraduate average of 3.16, and my house averaged a 3.52 last semester. But you’ll be hard-pressed to find a news article that mentions any of those facts about our community, when instead, writers go for the easy story about emails from recruitment two years ago.
I’m not trying to say the Greek system is perfect. I know there are aspects of this community that need to be changed. I know that recent issues that have been brought to light should be dealt with accordingly. However, we are more than just “gaggles of sorority girls making Greek hand signs.” We are women participating in organizations that value friendship, compassion, ambition, and other qualities that no misinterpreted email can strip from our sisterhoods. And as a member of the USC Panhellenic Community, I know that many of us would appreciate if the general public would stop jumping at opportunities to condemn a culture for superficiality while the many redeeming aspects of it are ignored.

Oh, jeez. Another sorority member whose chief complaint is that people judge the Greek system too much and accuse it of being superficial.
This piece glosses over a mountain of sins by pointing out that being neat and dressing proper is just standard protocol for first impressions. That’s true to a certain extent, but it’s obvious that the leaked Alpha Chi letter goes far beyond reasonable standards of “neat and clean,” whether it’s nitpicking about straight, NOT WAVY!!!!!, hair or about makeup. 
It completely ignores the very real criticisms that Greek life is exclusive and elitist in a way that discourages diversity, including of people who look and sound different from “the norm.” It ignores the complicated issue of how standardized apperances and conformity encourages men to categorize and objectivize women. It ignores how conformity asserts the importance of herd dynamics and discourages actions that will damage the group’s reputation (like, say, reporting a rape?). 
That sororities raise money for charity and often have good grades are such ridiculous red herrings in this debate.
This letter to the editor literally demonstrates the privilege of a smooth acceptance into Greek life without perceived discrimination for appearance and personal style. That it can’t reflect on that issue more, without toeing the company line of “we’re not superficial, see all the good things we do,” kind of sums up how the Greek bubble can operate.
I am in Greek life and have never had to “conform” as you like to put it. Speaking of appearances, I have naturally curly hair and not once has someone told me to straighten it for any reason. You are definitely able to be your unique self. We have women who dress in all different styles, classic, girly, hipster, bohemian, etc. 
As for the remark about rape, it is extremely hard for someone to relive that moment and report it. It is not because her sorority told her not to. It’s probably because she is not ready to go through that traumatizing experience again.
On another note, I do not see how raising money for charity and getting good grades are a bad thing. I think it is great that we are helping organizations and that we have some pretty intelligent women.
I think if you had the opportunity (and really took it with an open mind) to get to know at least 3 women in each of our 12 Panhellenic sororities on campus, you would find that we are a diverse group of people. We are involved in so many organizations like Undergraduate Student Government, Troy Camp, USC Hillel, Kicks for Kids, WYSE, and so much more. 
Most people only see the “superficial” side of Greek life because they do not take the time to really know our women. People are slamming the Greek community for judging people based on their looks, but I don’t see them getting to know us like we get to know our PNMs. People see us wearing our Greek letters and immediately judge us. There’s a bit of a double standard here, no?

I was telling my friend how to make scrambled eggs the other day and realized that I eat a lot of scrambled eggs, so I decided it would be appropriate to share my secrets for fluffy, delicious and inexpensive eggs. I’m telling you — I eat an obscene amount of scrambled eggs.
This recipe is simple and produces the best tasting egg out of any other technique I’ve tried. Your eggs won’t be watery or overcooked. Rather, they’ll be flavorful without being salty or too buttery, and they’re great for breakfasts, a quick lunch, or late night study sessions when the only thing you can think about are exams and the rumbling in your stomach.
Pro tip: Treat your scrambled eggs like you would a baby bird. Over-whisking makes the eggs tough, and when they become tough they get watery. Don’t crush your baby bird; don’t make it cry. 
What You’ll Need:
2 Large Eggs
1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
Splash of milk
Pinch of Salt
Pepper to taste
Thick Sliced Bread
Skillet or even a small pot
Directions:
*A great song to listen to while making this recipe is definitely “Every Breath You Take” by The Police.

Once relegated to the back corner of music stores and dusty storage boxes, vinyl records are making a comeback. Collector’s record shops are popping up from coast to coast. Rolling Stone reported that even in the economic downturn of 2010, vinyl sales started to climb. Most bands even release their EPs on vinyl –– Daft Punk sold 19,000 vinyl copies of Random Access Memories within the first week of the album’s debut in May. Though vinyl is a music format of the past, records hold a certain appeal and a sense of nostalgia.
For this generation of vinyl lovers, CDs and cassette tapes are both mediums within living memory — records hold a novel appeal. It’s difficult to find a dedicated CD store and nearly unthinkable for most musicians to release their latest EP on a cassette tape. Yet, cassette tapes have remained a popular format for experimental bands and industrial musicians. According to record store clerks, cassette tapes have a niche market that has never faded; most cassettes are home-produced, hand-numbered, limited run tapes.
For most music lovers, the click and reel of a cassette tape and the rainbow shine of a CD do not hold the same appeal as the ridges on an LP or 45. Records are delicate, tangible and more than a few decades old. Vinyl is not easily portable and requires a turntable. With these drawbacks, it seems paradoxical that record sales are on the way to overtaking CDs.
Even though, recording techniques have become more precise; shifting from analog to digital recording in the 1970s, record collectors feel vinyl has more depth of sound. Each technological innovation and subsequent media format distances the listener from the performer. Though experts conclude that the average listener cannot differentiate between analog and digital recordings, most consumers agree that vinyl’s pop, hiss and scratch sounds “warmer.”
In an interview with NPR, Scott Metcalfe, Director of Recording Arts and Sciences at the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University, described the nostalgia records evoke –– “We have lost the ritual, and we’ve lost the experience of sitting down and focusing on just a recording.” Spinning a record is not as simple as pressing “play,” the task of setting up a record on the turntable and dropping the needle means that listening to music is a more concentrated task.
Unlike instantly attainable music, there is a thrill to record shopping. Most collectors shop at multiple stores, frequent swap meets and peruse online resale sites. Finding that one album after digging through crates of LPs provides a sense of accomplishment that keeps audiophiles returning to record stores. In addition, most vinyl vendors deal in used records — their inventory is constantly changing — record shopping transforms from a means of acquiring music to a pastime.
What does vinyl have that other music formats lack? Records hold both visual and tactile appeal — from the larger than life album sleeves to the hypnotic way a record turns—records provide more than a purely auditory experience. Vinyl’s surging popularity is more than a brief uptick in sales — it marks a musical lifestyle revival. It’s not about the sound quality but the drop of the needle.

Coffee. We drink it in the morning. We drink it in the afternoon. We even drink it in the evening. In such a large city like Los Angeles, it can be difficult to find that perfect cup of Joe. Forget chains like Coffee Bean and Starbucks, in a city like L.A. it’s all about the independent shops.
For years, Silver Lake’s Intelligentsia and its subsequent locations have dominated the L.A. coffee scene. They work with roasters around the world to produce some of the best tasting coffee you’ll ever have. With a great ambience and such attention to detail, there’s no beating Intelligentsia – until you go to Alfred’s Coffee.
Alfred’s is the quintessential L.A. hot spot. Located on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood, you’re sure to love the décor, style and feel of Alfred’s. Relatively unknown to the public, but extremely popular to coffee-lovers, Alfred’s has the culture and philosophy that all will love. They exclusively brew Stumptown Coffee and there’s no shortage of views and scenes to snap a photo of on your phone. Alfred’s encompasses everything you want in a coffee shop. An excellent brew, plenty of seating, good vibes, and most importantly, it feels uniquely L.A.. If you’re new to the city or have never ventured out to try new spots, Alfred’s is the go to location to really grasp what L.A. is really all about. You feel like it’s too good to be true a place like Alfred’s exists.
Driving or Uber are your best bets from campus. There’s usually street parking available on Melrose Pl. or nearby La Cienega Blvd. Another location, Alfred’s in the Alley just opened up down the street on Melrose and later this month they’ll see yet another shop open in Brentwood. Alfred’s is on the rise and as they add to their expansion, it might be poised for widespread popularity, even outside LA.
As Alfred’s slogan goes, “But first, coffee.”

My philosophy class this semester has got me feeling a certain way — namely, outraged, furious and thoroughly nonplussed. Taught by a 300-year-old white professor who suspiciously resembles Aristotle himself, the class contends this week with Zeno’s paradox of motion.
Walking across a room, as Zeno describes, requires walking half the distance to the other side of the room, followed by half the remaining distance, followed by half of the rest and continuing into an infinite number of actions. Since time is finite, as Zeno reasons, it is impossible to complete that infinite number of actions to create movement. Therefore, motion is an illusion.
At first, I can’t relate much to yet another ancient Greek philosopher spouting his thoughts thousands of years ago. But while human experience has proven Zeno wrong (spoiler alert: motion is real), Zeno’s observation seems not physically but psychologically relevant to life at USC.
The first semester of my freshman year vanished in between dining hall visits, club meetings and Daily Trojan opinion articles. And I’m already starting to count down the rest of my time here. Meanwhile, the list of things to do before the end continues to grow — like Zeno’s paradox, I find myself with an increasingly infinite number of steps to take and a more evidently finite amount of time to finish them in.
I could be overstating. I could be high-strung. Or I could just be annoyingly ambitious. But I don’t think I’m alone. In the years leading up to USC, we’ve shaped so many of our experiences with the eventual collegiate goal in mind. And now that we’re here, each moment during “the best days of your lives” is precious — a cry to protect the ephemeral fun of university life and avoid the existential crises that thinking about the future will surely entail.
I’d like to revise Zeno’s paradox, as it applies to my USC experience. I’d concede that there are an increasingly infinite amount of goals to accomplish, but though I only have four years, my time is, just like Zeno’s distance, divisible into an infinite number of intervals. I choose to view my time as infinitely useful, and it’s my choice now to swallow my anxiety, turn off the time bomb and seize the literal infinity of opportunities awaiting me.

Some say that studying abroad in an English-speaking country is a cop-out. And I somewhat thought that too. But then I boarded my flight to London’s Heathrow.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, 80,000 American students study abroad each school year. When I became one of those thousands of kids hopping on a plane headed toward the heart of the British Empire, I had little hesitation. In high school, I traveled to Prague and parts of China and I remember that feeling of sometimes not being able to communicate the simplest of requests to a waiter or airport security guard because of the language barrier.
That would never be my issue in London or the rest of the United Kingdom, I thought as I sat on my flight to Europe.
Then my first ride on the Tube proved me wrong. Unlike the Metro in L.A., noise is kept to a bare minimum. Instead, everyone from businessmen to construction workers were thumbing through the London Evening Standard, the free evening newspaper, taking in the day’s biggest and most eccentric stories.
So in turn, I took advantage of the free newspapers and quietness as I rode the Tube home to my flat. I soon found that reading the paper was a linguistic exercise because the English Londoners speak is different mine.
I ran across words like: Lorries. Rough sleepers. Cheers. Lift. Quid. Every few grafs I had to look up a new word or phrase. Or sometimes just go with context clues.
Speaking the same language does not guarantee a mutual understanding. English is the third most spoken language in the world, according to the CIA. Despite millions of people sharing this language, the vastness of it also leaves room for many variations. People use language to describe the way they see the world and shape their culture. There is no doubt that the United Kingdom looks, feels and sounds different from the United States. Therefore, accents and colloquialisms in British culture are distinct from the ones with which I’m familiar.
For this reason, studying abroad in an English-speaking nation is not always a walk in the park (though it’s important to note the many spacious and beautiful parks London has to offer.) Yet, I believe I made the right decision in choosing to study abroad. By stepping out of the familiar and into a new culture, I am able to further understand myself. Because these two cultures are intertwined, each day I face and overcome the challenges of identifying the deviations and nuisances between them. This has made my appreciation of the U.S. and curiosity of the U.K. stronger.
And from my experience thus far, I don’t need to speak a different language to do so.
