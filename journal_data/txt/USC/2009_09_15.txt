USC’s chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is working to improve its pledge program and meet university behavioral standards, after university sanctions prevented them from participating in recruitment this fall.
SAE was originally placed under review in April, per a letter it received from Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards. At the beginning of the fall semester, the fraternity received another letter from SJACS, detailing the sanctions it was facing and informing the fraternity that it would be barred from recruitment, SAE President Matt Nicoletti said.
Nicoletti said he was told by the university that the sanctions were a result of an overall behavioral interpretation of the house.
“They said our behavior standards were not matching what they hoped for in a fraternity with regards to a lot of different things,” Nicoletti said.
He added that incidents during the spring semester were likely what prompted the April letter.
“Last school year was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back,” Nicoletti said.
The decision to place further regulations on SAE was a university decision, and the fraternity is not facing sanctions from the Interfraternity Council, said Gabe Worgaftik, IFC spokesman.
“It was entirely a university ruling,” Worgaftik said.
Fraternity members were surprised by the extent of the university’s actions, but have accepted the consequences and are working toward improving house policies, Nicoletti added.
“Nobody’s happy that we don’t have pledges, but overall the situation has been received well by the guys in the house,” Nicoletti said.
Beyond rush, the restrictions also place limits on the fraternity’s social calendar and Row-wide philanthropy events.
This semester, SAE is required to limit its social events to hosting one invite, one sorority-fraternity exchange and one registered party. SAE will also not be allowed to host a Row-wide philanthropy, since some of these events have been criticized for turning into “fundraiser-ragers,” Nicoletti said.
Instead, the fraternity will focus on participating in behavior and standards workshops, and will be hosting an anti-hazing education seminar.
Nicoletti and SAE Vice President Nate Carroll have also been asked by SJACS to step down from their positions by the end of the semester.
Nicoletti said he intends to comply with all the sanctions imposed by SJACS.
“We consider ourselves a top fraternity … But in the university’s eyes we weren’t up to their standards,” Nicoletti said. “We now have to educate guys about changing the fraternity’s culture.”
Nicoletti added that he does see a need for improvement in certain areas, such as mandatory attendance at university and IFC events.
“We will have to start participating more in the university and Greek community, which will be a positive thing for the house in the long run,” Nicoletti said.
Jameson Galey, a sophomore member of SAE, said he and his fellow members agree changes need to be made.
“In terms of pledging, a lot of things needed to change from the way things were and we need to revamp the whole process in general,” Galey said.
SAE will be monitored by both SJACS and the fraternity’s national organization, Nicoletti said.
In order to keep fraternity leadership accountable, the university is requiring that Nicoletti and Carroll meet with SJACS every other month until the end of their terms.
Nicoletti said SAE national officers will visit the house every month to make sure the chapter complies with the fraternity’s national standards.
SAE anticipates being able to participate in spring fraternity rush and recruitment events, Nicoletti said.
Ray Carlos, assistant director of the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, said all issues that go through SJACS are confidential and declined to comment.

Miscellaneous
incidents
On Sept. 11  at 10:51 a.m. DPS officers responded to a student who cut her leg on a lane line hook while entering a pool at the Physical Education Building.  A lifeguard administered first aid before the officers arrived and an LAFD RA unit was requested.  RA Unit #15 responded and examined the student, then transported her to California Hospital for additional medical treatment.
On Sept. 11 at 3:43 p.m. a student reported that while she was riding her bicycle near 37th  and Catalina streets. A suspect flagged her down and tricked her into allowing him to fondle her foot by claiming that he was a student working on a project.  Feeling uncomfortable, the student rode away on her bike and the suspect did not pursue her.  DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspect.
On Sept. 11 between 6:09 p.m. and 6:40 p.m. DPS officers
assisted LAPD officers in detaining three suspects who were observed loitering in on Jefferson Boulevard  and Hoover Street.  A check of the suspects’ names
revealed that one of them had two outstanding warrants and he was subsequently arrested.  The other two suspects were released at the scene.

The NFL’s opening weekend had many storylines, including the season and professional debuts of many former Trojan football players.
Most notable was Mark Sanchez, who was taken fifth overall in the 2009 NFL Draft, made an impressive first start as the Jets’ quarterback Sunday, leading his team to victory over the Texans. Sanchez completed 18 of 31 pass attempts for 272 yards and a touchdown with one interception.
Lining up against Sanchez was fellow USC 2009 draft class member linebacker Brian Cushing, who was a key part of the Texans’ defense, recording eight tackles.
Kaluka Maiava, Rey Maualuga and Clay Matthews also had professional debuts on Sunday. Maualuga recorded eight tackles, four of them solo, in the Bengals’ opener. Maiava and Matthews both recorded one tackle each in starts for the Browns and Packers, respectively.
Longer tenured former Trojans also had key contributions in season openers. Troy Polamalu, a member of the defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers, had six tackles and an interception against the Tennessee Titans, but he was sidelined with a knee injury that could keep him out for six weeks.
Former Heisman Trophy-winner Carson Palmer had a tough first game for the Bengals; he threw two picks in a loss. LenDale White (Titans) and Reggie Bush (Saints) also had little impact, each rushing for less than 30 yards in their respective games.

No matter how hard Pete Carroll tries to turn the focus forward to the upcoming game against Washington, Saturday’s classic against Ohio State might be the only thing USC fans talk about for some time.
The tilt between top-10 teams was a rarity on a number of levels.
Earlier in the fall, Carroll mused on how few last-minute thrillers he had been involved in as a college coach. Redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo noted in the locker room after the game that it may have been the first instance of a close win that USC has experienced since he joined the team.
But to the rest of the college football world, the primetime matchup was a ballad of a dying breed of intersectional regular-season games between top teams.
There’s a simple reason why ESPN and ABC hyped the last two matchups between the Trojans and Buckeyes so heavily — top-tier non-conference games are an endangered species.
Take a look at the non-conference schedules of the other top-five teams. Charleston Southern, Florida International and Louisiana-Monroe don’t exactly constitute a murderers’ row of opponents for powerhouse teams.
With strength of schedule no longer a component of the Bowl Championship Series, most teams would prefer to pay a small directional school a hefty payday in exchange for an easy win. And with the rise of giant-killers like Boise State, Utah and BYU, few teams want to even take a risk in jeopardizing their postseason hopes by scheduling a solid opponent.
San Jose State hardly made for a high-powered opener, but the Trojans still deserve credit for their courage in scheduling since Carroll’s arrival. USC is one of the few schools that has never played against a Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly known as Division-IAA) school. Moreover, the team has given its fans chances to see some of college football’s best and brightest, including then-powerhouses Kansas State, Auburn and Virginia Tech.
And that annual date with Notre Dame has made for some fun games, too.
“These difficult road games early in the year help make us,” Carroll said after Saturday’s win. “You build from there if you learn the lessons.”
It’s easy to say that the high reward of scheduling tough out-of-conference opponents outweighs the high risk after USC came away with yet another critical road win. But if the Trojans’ final drive had stalled, most fans probably would be bemoaning the strategy and wishing that Cal Poly had come to town for a guaranteed win before conference play.
And it’s not certain that the Trojans will parlay their success against Ohio State into wins in conference. The celebrations following last year’s romp against the Buckeyes were brought to a halt when Oregon State upended the Trojans the following Thursday.
But Carroll’s condition of “if you can learn the lessons” is the key to the rest of the season and whether anything will grow from the team’s experience in the Midwest. The Trojans were outplayed for long stretches of the game and have plenty to take away from the game in ways to improve.
How they respond to the flaws they showed Saturday will ultimately determine how far the Trojans can go during the rest of the season. The 2004 team took more than just a win away from its contest with Virginia Tech and only experienced a couple more close calls on their way to the national championship.
But no matter how far USC goes from this point forward, fans should be grateful to the school and team for giving them arguably the most entertaining game of the last three and a half years.
“This is the most intense college football game I’ve ever been a part of,” Galippo said.
USC doesn’t look like it will be changing its scheduling philosophy anytime soon. Tennessee Athletic Director Mike Hamilton announced last week that his school had reached a verbal agreement with USC for a home-and-home in 2021 and 2022.
To give you an idea of how far off that is, both Carroll and current Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin could be long gone by the time that series comes to fruition — if it ever does. There’s no guarantee that both programs will still be competitive come kickoff. I will be 34 when the second game is played and the future USC student who will hold my current position at the Daily Trojan is probably only eight years old right now.
But I’m sure we’ll both be watching the game.

Remember when it was all about Pig Latin?
In eighth grade, speaking the language made you opular-pay. You could eat unch-lay with the ool-cay kids, and no one would tell you to am-scray.
You may have thought you were participating in a secret club, but you were really just participating in culture. And you were doing so in one of the easiest and most opular-pay ways — by spreading a meme.
A meme is generally defined as a cultural idea that is spread by imitation and repetition. From religious philosophies to phrases like “that’s what she said,” memes have continually played a large role in society. Notably, their formation and content has been altered by the existence of the Internet: The web has spawned a whole new environment for communication, and the memes that developed online are the ones everyone talks about.
If you’ve ever cracked a Chuck Norris joke or been to ICanHasCheezburger.com, you’ve participated in an Internet meme. And while you might not be proud of the number of times you’ve watched the YouTube video “Daniel After Dentist,” your involvement with the phenomena is in fact “real life.”
The possibilities of a meme are at once endless and seemingly pointless. Most tend to have some sort of a mocking element, as “Rick-Rolling” did. The trend involved providing a link and claiming it was relevant to any topic, but instead giving the URL of Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” music video instead. The meme might appear to not serve a purpose, but laughing at someone else’s expense (be it the victim or Rick Astley himself) always serves the purpose of entertainment.
The nerdiest of memes tend to stay within their subcultural circles, but they occasionally make it to the mainstream, causing n00bs to say “FTW.” Probably the best example of a well-known meme that many people just don’t like is “All your base are belong to us.”
The phrase originated from a shoddy translation in a Chinese video game; once web users discovered it, they repeated it constantly. Pictures of the Mona Lisa and The Cat in the Hat were photoshopped and then given the expression as the caption; The Laziest Men on Mars created a techno song and used the phrase as lyrics. Someone even wrote a poem combining HTML hex codes and the meme, creating a geek’s ultimate Hallmark card: “Roses are #FF0000, Violets are #0000FF, All my base are belong to you.”
Such incarnations of “All your base” were an example of the fact that, for certain memes, manifestations and user recreations could be essentially more interesting than the meme itself. Users chose to interact with the phrase and turn it into a way bigger deal than it probably ever should have been, and, because of their involvement, the poor translation will go down in Internet history.
It is easy to look at trends like this and renounce them as stupid, beneath you or devoid of cultural significance. And true, a banana singing “Peanut Butter Jelly Time” should probably not be compared to Faulkner. However, the fact is that millions of people are out there videotaping their reactions to “2 Girls 1 Cup,” and if participation doesn’t constitute culture, then what does?
Memes may not be respectable but they are there, provoking responses and imitations. By promoting interaction, these dumb expressions, typos and slow-motion replays of people falling down define a large aspect of our culture. The web can be what we make of it, and if we want to make it about auto-tuned news and bad flash animations, so be it. The people have spoken.
Meme-theorists (yes, they exist) believe that memes evolve by natural selection, and that the life of a viral video or idiom depends on the behaviors of its host. It can be assumed, then, that we have gotten ourselves to this point, and that we control their existence (read: if you look down upon memes, then don’t watch “Keyboard Cat”).
On the other hand, if you do not see these mindless trends as in poor taste, the world (wide web) is your oyster. You can forward links to Soulja Boy video remixes, view hundreds of pictures captioned, “THIS IS SPARTA” and Rick-roll whomever you choose. Better yet, you can justify it all by saying you are simply experiencing culture.
As of now, the countless hours and myriad of people that go into making an Internet meme survive is not hurting anyone. However, if we let these memes become too prevalent, they could lose their ironic appeal and make us all just that much more foolish. And all our base would belong to them.

It feels a little indulgent for one journalist to jump to the defense of another when full disclosure gets a colleague into trouble. Not all journalists exercise good judgment when they choose to release confidential information, and, in some cases, they deserve to face the consequences.
In the past, some journalists have been known to set prudence and timing aside for the sake of gaining the fame and notoriety of breaking a big story. They did so by claiming that citizens have the right to know what their government does — both the good and the bad. Touting this important truth for the sake of personal gain is not simply wrong; it’s despicable. In these cases, when the leak of information has had harmful consequences on bigger plans which need to be protected by secrecy until fully formed, it is right for journalists to be brought to justice.
However, this was not the case for Florence Hartmann, who was charged with contempt of court earlier this week. The French journalist had worked as the spokesperson for the Hague Tribunal’s former chief prosecutor for six years before she was brought to court, and before that she covered the Bosnian war.
Her offense was the 2007 publication of a book and an article in which she discussed the existence of confidential court documents. While the exact content of these secret files is unknown, they are thought to detail Serbian government involvement in the Bosnian war during the 1990s. Specifically, they may chronicle contacts between the Serbian government and the Bosnian Serb army — the kind of details that could incriminate the Serbian government not only for war crimes, but for genocide.
There are some facts that should probably be kept secret from the world until every respective party has had time to fully prepare for the effects of exposure. Genocide is not one of them.
Hartmann felt that the legitimacy she could bring to the case because of her position and reputation would play an invaluable role in bringing justice to the victims of the war in Bosnia.
She maintained in her published works that the documents would provide a link between Belgrade and the massacre of approximately 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995. Releasing this information brought Hartmann notoriety and a 7,000-euro ($10,000) fine — but it also made her a hero.
When she went before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,  Hartmann faced up to seven years in prison and a 90,000-euro fine. The court might well have chosen to give her a less severe punishment because it knew that the international outcry against such a sentence (and, indeed, against the current ruling) would be fierce, but many believe her trial was merely held in order to set a legal precedent.
Rather than slapping the wrists of those who expose their failures, the justice system should be thanking the likes of Hartmann for bringing greater transparency to the field.
Granted, the court may have some reason to believe that, as argued, sovereign states may be less willing to offer up confidential documents for consideration after this debacle. Nevertheless, victims of the Bosnian massacres would be unable to seek reparations from the Serbian government without access to these files. The court should have found a legal way to bring these documents into the public eye — perhaps, as Hartmann argued, during another trial that was going on at the time, in which Bosnia tried to sue Serbia for genocide.
Hartmann now has a criminal record under her belt and a fine to pay. The former should be easy to overcome, given her position — hopefully she can satisfy the latter through book sales.

Since the invention of spoken language, the untruth has probably been told just as much — if not more — than the truth. The average person lies three times per 10 minutes of conversation, which means by the time you’ve reached the end of this article, statistics say I would have lied to you a whole two and a half times (though I would never do that).
Lying has become so common in the way we communicate with each other that these tiny tales of deceit have begun to perpetuate a society filled with two types of people: nonbelievers and believers — or more simply, cynics and idiots.
Though most lies aren’t actually intended to harm anyone, they’re still too often uttered. As children, our mothers told us to be good or Santa Claus wasn’t going to bring us presents. We know now that there is no Santa Claus (or Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy, for that matter), and as for the cookies we left, our parents had been eating them all along.
Today, the squeaky-clean Disney kids blab about still being virgins, which is questionable for many of them. Paris Hilton divulges her daily dose of verbal garbage to the public, claiming in interviews she has “never done drugs,” though a pixelated video on TMZ could easily prove her wrong. On other occasions, celebrities deny getting plastic surgery, being bulimic or dating their co-stars — all of which later turn out to be true.
And we lie too. On Facebook we tell each other how “gorgeous” or “hot” we think our friends look when really the atrocious outfit they’re wearing or horrendous facial expression is in no way deserving of either compliment.
But in the world of distortion and scandal, the term “lie” is just another harsh name for industry jargon, specifically “damage control.”  That is why actress Mischa Barton felt compelled to visit the The View while on her public apology tour in an effort to challenge the audience’s gullibility — only nobody’s buying it.
With her memorized script of excuses in mind, Barton, who battled allegations of hardcore drug use and heavy partying over the past year, blamed her downward spiral on a surgery from hell for the removal of her wisdom teeth. Barton said she was in extreme pain, but unable to take painkillers because of her work schedule. I guess that’s how she turned to cocaine.
Following the botched surgery, Barton was hospitalized in mid-July and placed under involuntary psychiatric hold at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
Locked up in a psych ward for bad dental surgery? Something is not adding up.
During the TV interview, Barton got tongue-tied on her words. She quickly changed subject by describing the abrasive media attention surrounding her hospitalization as a “perfect storm,” like “everything was happening at once.” These lines, as well as countless others, were clearly rehearsed, as they were doled out verbatim by Barton to other media outlets weeks before. As she robotically fed viewers her explanations, the public wondered: How dumb does she think we are?
With so many lies coming directly from persons of public status, the truth becomes more disastrously unclear. If celebrities are allowed to justify drug sprees and reckless nights on the Sunset Strip with a bad experience after getting teeth pulled, where will we draw the line for excusatory nonsense that we can accept? Every interview in Hollywood seems to be for reputation repair.
Likewise, politicians operate on a similar note: selling Senate seats, having adulterous affairs and funneling shady earmarks. They claim innocence to the death and fool the forgiving public until they’re finally caught. The public feels cheated but must learn a valuable lesson — take everything with a grain of salt, until we can hold celebrities and politicians more accountable.
Barton’s best plea is weak, and we should be cautious. As the Hollywood machine — so often a microcosm for politics — keeps churning, celebrities will continue to spew lies as long as the public remains impressionable. And sadly, that’s no lie.

Muse, The Resistance
Warner Bros.
Length: 54 min.
Now available
Anyone looking for Muse’s signature soaring vocals and epic dynamic swells will not be disappointed by its newest release, The Resistance. That being said, after the album leads with “Uprising,” a bustling call to arms against the proverbial “they,” it follows with track after track of token Muse ballads that are all too similar to previous efforts from the group. Though the usual strident vocals and colossal choruses won’t bore listeners, other than the Middle Eastern influences on “United States of Eurasia,” the first seven songs offer nothing new.
Just as “MK Ultra” and “Unnatural Selection” leave fans wondering if Muse has already depleted every tool in its arsenal, an eerie, haunting tango lurches from the piano to start “I Belong to You” and begins to save the album from monotonous obscurity. The gems that follow serve as a three-part symphony finale entitled “Exogenesis.”  Each leads with lengthy instrumental intros that could stand on their own as accompaniment to a ballet or opera. This final magnum opus leaves the listener breathless, reminded once again why Muse has become a musical heavyweight of this past decade.

Thrice, Beggars
Vagrant Records
Length: 43 min.
Now available
Irvine post-punk band Thrice has been at it for almost a decade, but its stalwart status makes no apologies for its seventh studio album, Beggars, which takes a step back from the band’s increasingly conceptual work to revisit the upbeat sounds of its past. After its first two albums — Identity Crisis and Illusion of Safety — introduced the fast, spastic guitar-driven songs that defined its initial popularity, Thrice slid into its softer side. Vheissu turned Thrice’s mosh-inducing hardcore into ambient, almost spiritual sounds by incorporating electronics, strings and a Rhodes piano. And with four separate CDs — each with an earth, wind, fire or water theme — released in two bouts of double discs, The Alchemy Index served as the climax for the band’s lofty conceptual goals.  But after four discs filled with various experimental techniques and ambiguously religious lyrics, Beggars comes in to showcase that Thrice is capable of meeting the two personalities in the middle. Singer Dustin Kensrue fluctuates between scratchy screams and soaring high notes, drummer Riley Breckenridge keeps 4-4 as often as he goes off conventional time signatures and the band as a whole presents on Beggars a more mature version of the sound that won its first fans nine years ago. After going to the extreme with an ambitious concept album, the members of Thrice have been able to hold back enough to make an album that isn’t too hot or too cold, but just right.

Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson, Break Up
Rhino Records
Length: 27 min.
Now available
Three years ago, actress Scarlett Johansson and singer/songwriter Pete Yorn recorded a string of catchy duets in 48 hours without much thought of the outcome. Inspired by the 1968 actress-musician duets of Brigitte Bardot and Serge Gainsbourg, Yorn asked Johansson if she’d like to record some songs with him and, unfazed by outside influences or expectations, the two laid down the tracks that were to become their album, Break Up. Although Johansson released a solo album of awkward Tom Waits covers last year, Break Up was recorded almost two years prior. The dreamy banjos and throaty soul vocals take listeners on a sonic journey though a mutually self-destructive relationship. Even though the story arc is depressing, the songs are upbeat. Even in moments when the lyrics threaten imminent relationship disintegration, one can’t help but bob along with the catchy guitar work. But while closer in concept to the Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward collaboration band She & Him, the Johansson-Yorn album varies in one major respect — Yorn wrote everything. Johansson lends unexpectedly sultry harmonies — like a more baritone Amy Winehouse — to Yorn’s crisp pop-rock songs, but she fails to demonstrate that she understands any of the musical technicalities gone into the album’s creation.  Great for the celebrity novelty — they even cover Big Star — but unfortunately, Break Up pushes little boundaries for either party involved.

Big Star, Keep an Eye on the Sky (Box Set)
Rhino Records
Four-disc set
Now available
Big Star is the one band that everyone knows, but no one has heard of. Although the Memphis foursome self-released two albums during their three years as a band, they played only a handful of shows, received little radio play and were virtually unknown when they disbanded in 1974. But after a 1978 release of the previously recorded — and musically darker — album Third/Sister Lovers,  Big Star’s ragged-guitar, country-tinged power-pop slowly gained a cult following and the short-lived band has since inspired an eclectic list of subsequent generations’ alternative rock musicians from The Replacements to R.E.M.  Recognizing its influence on indie bands around the world, Big Star reunited in the early ’90s, and has been actively touring, releasing live records and keeping a presence greater than in its heyday (think That 70’s Show’s theme song and Adventureland soundtrack). And to demonstrate its evolution from refined British Invasion wannabe rock-n-roll to the meticulously textured pop finesse that fuels modern alternative music, Rhino Records has compiled a four-disc box set titled Keep an Eye on the Sky. With nearly 100 tracks of rarities, remixes, live recordings and unreleased tracks packaged together with liner notes, unseen photos and essays about the band’s history, Big Star is celebrating its belated popularity by giving its now-massive fan base the definitive resource for its cultural legacy.

The latest collaborative effort between LAPD and USC’s Department of Public Safety could end up costing bikers up to $250.
LAPD and DPS are joining together to step up enforcement of bicycle laws around USC. The effort will include an LAPD task force — officers dedicated entirely to monitoring bike safety at USC — that will patrol key intersections near campus on specific days and issue citations.
Violation · Students bike through the crosswalk at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street. Biking in crosswalks is against California’s traffic laws and students who do so could be ticketed by LAPD. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
“We will have a task force because the bicycle issue is becoming a very serious issue,” said Officer Boyce of LAPD’s South Traffic Division.
There are three specific traffic laws that students often violate, Boyce said. He said LAPD has repeatedly noticed students biking against the flow of traffic, not stopping at stop signs and riding their bikes through intersections, all of which violate regulations.
Boyce said there will be one or two officers out each day, but the larger task force will monitor the area occasionally.
DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas said DPS is most concerned with the intersection of Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard and the intersection of McClintock Avenue and Jefferson.
Thomas noted that the goal of the increased is not to aggravate or punish students, but to make the intersections safer.
“You don’t want to write a citation if you don’t have to, but we have to clean up those intersections because we have seen accidents occur there,” Thomas said.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said DPS has seen many of the same types of traffic violations as LAPD.
“If bicyclists want to ride through the intersection, they should do so as a car would,” Carlisle said. “If they’re going to be in crosswalks and they have a bike they’re supposed to walk it, but they usually don’t.”
At crosswalks, Boyce said, bikes are considered vehicles, and by riding through intersections they are interfering with pedestrians.
Students who are found violating a traffic law can be ticketed by LAPD.
Currently, only LAPD officers are issuing city traffic citations, but DPS officers are being trained to be able to cite bicyclists as well.
The maximum penalty for a traffic infraction is a $250 fine. Citations can also involve appearances in traffic court.
“It will likely involve a fine,” Carlisle said. “The idea is not to punish, it’s to change behavior.”
Though DPS has asked LAPD to issue warnings before giving out citations, Boyce said it is at the discretion of the officer whether to give a warning or an actual citation, and some citations have already been issued.
Anna Phillips, a sophomore majoring in international relations and economics, was stopped by an LAPD officer on Wednesday while riding her bike through the intersection of McClintock and Jefferson.
Phillips was given a ticket, and was told the amount of the fine would be sent to her by mail.
“I would have an easier time understanding all of it if they had publicized these rules,” Phillips said. “If I had known it was illegal to bike in that manner then I wouldn’t do it.”
Other students were also irked by the decision to enforce bike rules.
“I’m not from here, so I don’t really know the bike laws and I don’t want to be punished for something I’ve never been educated about,” said Nicole Katekaru, a sophomore majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.
Some students, however, thought the citations could be a good thing for student safety.
Jessica Erskine, a senior majoring in theatre, said she thought it was students’ responsibility to learn the traffic laws.
“If you’re breaking the law, I feel like there’s not much you can do about it,” Erskine said. “I don’t think there’s any case for us to say that’s not fair. There are rules of the road and they’re there for our safety.”
To help educate students, DPS gave out fliers last week detailing the laws they and LAPD will be enforcing.
Laura Driscoll, a freshman majoring in international relations, said she didn’t think the new push for bike safety would lead to a long-term change in students’ habits.
“We’re at school and we’re in a hurry,” Driscoll said. “People may take the time to think about getting off their bike if cops are giving tickets, but if people don’t see a cop, they’re probably not going to get off.”
DPS and LAPD officers will continue to monitor bike safety at least through the end of the semester, Boyce said.
DPS officers cannot yet issue tickets, but they can cite students to USC Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards.
Though LAPD would not confirm which days the task force will be around campus, resident advisers in Troy Hall were told by the “Adopt a Hall” DPS officer in the building that the task force would be out and ticketing on Sept. 17 and Oct. 8, according to Pablo Ortiz de Urbina, an RA in Troy.
I’m assuming they’re issuing infractions for Section 85.07(a) of the LA Municipal code that details infractions of signage – since they have apparently added “walk your bike in the crosswalks” signs.
 (a)     The Department of Transportation is hereby authorized to install any traffic control devices it determines necessary to regulate roller-skating, skateboarding and bicycling on sidewalks and roadways in order to improve vehicular or pedestrian movement, reduce congestion or diminish accident potential. Such determinations shall be made only on the basis of traffic engineering principles and traffic investigations.  When such determinations have been made, the Department is authorized to install signs giving notice as to the nature of the regulation as well as signs that provide such safety warnings as it determines will assist those engaged in the regulated activities.
Of course, I question a few aspects – like whether or not a traffic investigation has been done regarding the benefit of a sign as a traffic control device, particularly given its location.
I also think the idea of pushing for “bike safety” as they’re calling it is absurd. The fact that it’s being referred to as “the bicycle issue” signifies the lack of care the bicycling is being given. As far as I’m concerned, when someone can lock their bike without worrying about it getting stripped (all those parts people don’t lock – cages, pedals, brakes, brake levers, seats, etc), LAPD can get concerned with how people are using them. Until then, they’re mishandling their resources. Education can happen – but penalizing people isn’t going to do it.
Oh, and I’m certainly not stopping at a stop sign as long as I know people who have been tackled from their bikes. Idaho has it right – for bicyclists, red lights should be stop signs and stop signs should be yield signs.
Can someone please post the text of the citation they received?  If it is…”21200. (a) Every person riding a bicycle upon a highway has all the rights and is subject to all the provisions applicable to the driver of a vehicle by this division;” fight the tickets.  The L.A.M.C. allows for bicycle riding on sidewalks which at best creates a gray area with regard to crosswalks in L.A.  Since there is no law written anywhere regarding the rights and restrictions of cyclists in crosswalks, it’s a real stretch for anyone to say you can’t do it.
If you don’t believe me, you should ride the Orange Line Bike path in the Valley.  That path, which was approved by Metro and the LADOT actually includes crosswalks that you are expected to ride through.
Incidentally, here is the L.A.M.C.:
Sidewalk Riding (LAMC 56.15) Prohibits the riding of bicycles (or other human power devices) on sidewalks (bikeways or boardwalks) with a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. Disallows the riding of bicycles on Ocean Front Walk in Venice.
[…] The Daily Trojan reports that the LAPD and USC Campus Security are teaming up to more effectively enforce the law that prohibits cyclists from crossing the street while riding. What the article misses, and what the LAPD sometimes seems to understand and sometimes gets confused is that such a ban doesn't exist. […]

The White House announced last week President Obama’s intent to nominate Erroll Southers, the associate director of USC’s Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, as the assistant secretary of the Transportation Security Administration.
After announcing his intended nominees to various posts — Southers included — President Obama said in a press release, “I am grateful that these fine individuals have agreed to serve my administration at this important time for our nation. I look forward to working with them in the months and years ahead to strengthen our economy, keep our nation safe and provide new opportunities for all our people.”

With a broad spectrum of public service under his belt, Southers will contribute his expertise and experience from serving as deputy director of homeland security for the state of California, a police officer with the Santa Monica Police Department and a special agent with the FBI.
“[We’re] sorry to see him go, actually,” said Marshall McClain, president of the Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association in a press release. “Out of the new management team, I would say he was the most well-received and most well-liked.”
In addition to his responsibilities at CREATE, he is also pursuing a doctorate in policy, planning, and development at the university.
CREATE declined to comment until the nomination is confirmed.
As a TSA administrator, Southers will supervise the efforts to protect United States highways, railroads, ports and mass transit systems. He will also be in charge of the Federal Air Marshal Service and security operations for 450 government-run airports throughout the country.
Additionally, Southers will oversee approximately 50,000 employees, 45,000 of whom work as screeners providing security at government-run airports nationwide, according to CNN.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano approved of President Obama’s intent to nominate Southers.
“Effective transportation security involves protecting our citizens from threats while facilitating travel around the country and throughout the world,” Napolitano said in a press release. “Erroll’s expertise in counterterrorism and airport security will be a great asset to the department in our efforts to ensure the safety of the nation’s transportation systems.”
Upon official nomination, the Senate Commerce Committee will commence with a background investigation of Southers that will lead to a Senate confirmation hearing.
Southers declined to comment until the nomination is official.
Southers holds a bachelor’s degree from Brown University as well as an MPA from USC.

Now that fall is underway, it’s time for the the Trojan faithful to gear up and get their sports on. But lost amid all the (justified) hoopla over the USC football team, the buzz surrounding the untested men’s basketball team and articles covering the expected and continued dominance of both the men’s and women’s water polo squads is one team of Trojans that gets results without any national press coverage: the women’s ultimate frisbee team.
Ultimate frisbee, a competitive team sport combining elements of football, basketball and soccer, is a club sport at USC. The women’s team — known as the Hellions of Troy — competes and trains on its own time, with little school funding and no athletic scholarship money. But despite being a relatively young program — the team was founded just six years ago, in the fall of 2003 — the Hellions have already proven themselves to be one of the best college ultimate frisbee teams in the nation.
New Heights · The Hellions, USC’s women’s ultimate frisbee team, earned their first-ever berth into the national championship tournament last year with a record of 27-18. - Photos courtesy of USC women’s ultimate frisbee team 
Last year, the Hellions posted a 27-18 regular-season record en route to their first-ever berth at the invitation-only national championship tournament in Columbus, Ohio. With wins over traditional athletic powerhouses such as Arizona, Illinois, Colorado and Michigan State, the Hellions made a mark for themselves around the country — but they are still forced to work hard to recruit new players for this year’s team.
“Recruitment is always an issue,” said Recruitment Chair Lauren Eng. “We’re running an intramural league right now to introduce new players to the game, and we’re going to start holding open practices next month.
“Anyone can come out — most people come to [play] frisbee never even having played before college.”
While the majority of players were former athletes in high school — soccer and track and field are the most highly represented former sports among members of both the women’s team and its male counterpart, the Ghettobirds — many players come to ultimate simply to meet new people and enjoy the social aspects of the club. Whatever their reasons for joining, most Trojans who start playing ultimate soon find themselves hooked.
“It’s really great,” said senior Lindsey Cross. “You go out there to practices and to tournaments, and the people on the team end up becoming some of your best friends.”
The team practices twice a week in the fall and spring, and travels to about 10 weekend tournaments each year. Though it’s not guaranteed, the Hellions have their sights on a return to the national championships this coming spring.
“We graduated a lot of people, but we have a lot of talent coming back as well,” Cross said. “The rookies who’ve shown up already look very solid, and we’re always looking for more players.”

Two of the biggest stars of USC’s football team did not fully participate in practice yesterday as they nursed injuries suffered in Saturday’s game against Ohio State.
Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley is recovering from a bruised right shoulder and didn’t make any throws during practice, while senior safety Taylor Mays didn’t partake in any drills after mildly spraining his right knee in the Trojans’ 18-15 win over the Buckeyes.
Big loss? · USC safety Taylor Mays was held out of practice because of the injury he sustained in the 18-15 win against Ohio State Saturday. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan 
Coach Pete Carroll said both players are day-to-day and it is unclear when they will return to practice.
“We’re going to wait until [Tuesday] to find out,” Carroll said.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Aaron Corp took snaps with the first-team offense during practice, and freshman T.J. McDonald and sophomore Drew McAllister filled in for Mays in the Trojans’ secondary.
Carroll said he is not sure at this point when Barkley would need to return to practice to start Saturday’s game at Washington. But if the true freshman doesn’t practice this week, the coach said he probably won’t play against the Huskies.
“I would think not, but we’ll find out,” Carroll said.

Junior running back Joe McKnight, who ran for a game-high 60 yards and caught two passes for 45 yards against the Buckeyes, was named Pac-10 offensive player of the week.
“It feels good,” McKnight said. “You just can’t let that get to your head. You’ve just got to come out, work hard everyday and continue playing hard.”
McKnight showed up most when it counted in Columbus, Ohio. On the Trojans’ game-winning touchdown drive in the closing minutes of the game, the running back gained 32 yards on the ground, 21 yards through the air and caught the two-point conversion pass to extend USC’s lead to three.
McKnight said he was thankful Carroll left him on the field for the majority of the game-winning drive. He wanted to take advantage of that opportunity and take over.
“I was a little surprised [to be on the field at the end of the game],” McKnight said. “But Coach Carroll always had faith in me to make plays. I guess at that time he really believed in me to get us down the field, and that’s what happened.”
McKnight admitted he made mistakes when the ball was in his hands during his first two years as a Trojan. But now, in his third year, he is focusing more on ball security than making spectacular plays, as he did at the end of the Ohio State game.
“I didn’t want to cough the ball up,” he said. “That was the only thing on my mind. I wasn’t trying to break anything or make anybody miss. I was just trying to get downfield and keep the ball in my hands.”
Overshadowed by the game-winning drive in Columbus was the play of USC’s defense down the stretch.
Carroll thought that the defense stepped up after some early miscues and played really well in the second half.
“I thought it was really cool that the guys hung together and continued to give us a chance to win the football game,” Carroll said. “And when it came down to it, we found a way.”
Redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo was one of the many defensive players who stood out to Carroll. Galippo had five tackles and an interception that he returned for 51 yards, setting up USC’s touchdown in the first quarter.
“The guy is really aware and watching what’s going on,” Carroll said.

Got you! Though White on Rice’s deceptive title suggests a stereotype-ridden culture comedy, this indie flick is an equal opportunity workplace of family, romance and slice-of-life humor. But too many angles leave no room for solid development, and despite strong acting and clever staging, White on Rice’s mishmash of comedy and an annoying lead make incompetence appear front and center.
Jimmy (Hiroshi Watanabe) fails at life. Fresh from Japan, the odd-jobs man recovers from a divorce, mooches off his sister’s family and shares a room with his 10-year-old nephew. His sister defends him because he keeps things entertaining, but Jimmy is ready to find a wife — and his brother-in-law’s fetching niece seems like the perfect solution.

The off-beat film follows Jimmy (Watanabe), a 40-year-old slacker who attempts to recover from a recent divorce by falling in love. - Photo courtesy of Variance Films
The film follows Jimmy’s incompetent quest for love as he stalks his intended, vandalizes property and forges his way through the rest of the Quirky Comedy checklist.
All the bits of a successful comedy are there. Romantic ineptitude? Check. Endearingly strange characters? Check. Amusing cultural stereotypes? Check. But none of the aspects feel developed enough to build into bigger laughs, and spark only scattered chuckles instead of solid gut-busters.
White on Rice can never decide which quirky comedy it wants to be — the putting-the-fun-in-dysfunctional family flick, the smug-but-astute racial commentary or the simple let’s-watch-an-endearing-freak-validate-his-existence piece. It tries on all three and buys them all.
Little Miss Sunshine, Harold and Kumar and Napoleon Dynamite may not have clung to subgenre guardrails, but each had a definite focus. With White on Rice’s eclectic approach, the film wanders from scene to scene and scrounges for any gag it can get. Perhaps White on Rice wanted to prove that one cannot put a genre on life. Yet life has too many comedic angles for even the most ambitious comedy. Trying to catch them all spreads the humor far too thin.
White on Rice has a second inescapable flaw: an unendingly irritating protagonist. Characters do not have to be likeable — just look at As Good as it Gets or A Christmas Carol — but the audience should care. With Jimmy, can someone just get this 40-year-old moron off the screen? He is just too pathetic, too ridiculous and too static to invoke any empathy. It’s no fun hoping for his untimely demise either; while the film throws in a few surprises, there’s no doubt that it’s a fluffernutter comedy.
Jimmy’s incompetence as a lead also grates because he takes time away from other, far more compelling characters. His brother-in-law, Tak (Mio Takada), is a cranky fogey who just wants to put some pizzazz in his marriage, while Jimmy’s wunderkind nephew, Bob (Justin Kwong), has all the deadpan charm of Charlie Brown and none of the cutesiness of many comedy kiddos. In fact, Tak’s dissevered family would make a great comedy — a scene involving a seamy lingerie shop proves it.
Somehow, Watanabe’s performance saves Jimmy — and much of the movie — from total dissatisfaction. The subtly he gives to the ridiculous character, from his indignant terror at a towering woman to his smugly world-weary advice to his nephew, are thoughtfully nuanced and fun to watch. It’s when Watanabe has to read from the erratic script or carry out the film’s ridiculous plot development that even he can’t save his character.
The other actors do not slouch, either. From Takada’s geezer rage to Kwong’s deadpan pragmatism, White on Rice features several talented actors who could carry their own comedies.
Director and co-writer Dave Boyle, a new face in comedy, clearly has much to offer. While the film might lack focus, it does not lack subtlety: Little touches, such as a samurai spoof called Ambush at Blood Trail Gate or business-savvy Bob’s portable credit card reader, add substance and laughs to a film that wanders across the comedy board. Despite a small budget, the film never feels cheap or corner-cut, at least in physical construction.
Ultimately, White on Rice suffers from what it could have been. As it is, its weaknesses do not squash all enjoyment. If it had more focus, more direction and a lead who could garner more than snickers, it would have been the little indie treat it seeks to be. As White on Rice reaffirms, even dancing bananas cannot solve all problems.
