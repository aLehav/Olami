Unsurprisingly, the No. 4 USC women’s volleyball team’s convincing four-set upset of then-No. 1 Stanford this past Thursday earned the Women of Troy (26-4, 14-4) considerable conference attention.
Climbing the ladder · Junior libero Natalie Hagglund now places third all-time on USC women’s volleyball’s career digs list. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
For the third time this season, junior All-American libero Natalie Hagglund was named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week, while freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio claimed her fifth Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honor. Bricio’s fifth weekly award paces all Pac-12 freshmen.
Hagglund, whose 596 digs in 2011 placed her third on USC’s all-time single-season record list, registered a career-high 44 digs against Stanford — also more digs than any Pac-12 player has notched in 2012. With 516 digs already this season, Hagglund appears poised to surpass last season’s mark, assuming the Women of Troy make a deep postseason run.
The Pac-12 First Team libero also added 19 digs against California to lead the Women of Troy to their fifth consecutive victory, increasing her career digs total to 1,609, which places her third all-time at USC.
Freshman sensation Bricio led all scorers against both Stanford and Cal and notched her 10th double-double of the season versus Stanford, delivering 19 kills and adding 22 digs. Against the Golden Bears, she continued to sizzle with 18 kills and two aces.
Bricio now ranks fourth in the Pac-12 in kills per set (4.12) and leads the conference in service aces per set (.34).
The Women of Troy will travel to Corvallis, Ore. on Tuesday to face Oregon State (14-16, 4-14) in an 8 p.m. match before finishing the season against No. 7 UCLA on Friday.
Both matches will air on the Pac-12 Networks.

Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee has been announced as one of three finalists for the 2012 Biletnikoff Award, joining Baylor senior Terrance Williams and West Virginia junior Stedman Bailey.
The trio will attend the trophy presentation at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Fla. on Dec. 6 to see who will be honored as the nation’s best wide receiver.
Lee is the national leader in catches with 107 and receiving yards with 1,605, the latter being a Pac-12 single-season record.
Lee needs just five more receptions to break the conference mark, which was set just last season by his teammate junior wide receiver Robert Woods.
Lee is third in the country in receiving touchdowns (14), a category led by Bailey (20). Bailey is also fourth in receiving yards (1,260) and fifth in receptions (88).
Williams is eighth in receptions (82), second in receiving yards (1,518) and tied for fourth in receiving touchdowns (11).
In the Trojans’ Oct. 27 game at Arizona, Lee caught 16 passes on his way to setting the Pac-12 record for most receiving yards (345) in a game. Among his other notable performances this season was the home opener against Hawai’i in which he scored a touchdown on the first play of the game and also returned a kickoff for a touchdown.
Lee might be perceived as a favorite for the award, considering he is the only flanker in the country currently receiving attention for the Heisman Trophy, as well.
In ESPN’s latest Heisman Poll, Lee ranks sixth, which puts him just one spot away from being named a finalist for the award.
Former Oklahoma State wide receiver Justin Blackmon won the last two Biletnikoff awards, beating out Woods and former Oklahoma receiver Ryan Broyles last season.

The USC women’s basketball team hopes to build off its 65-56 win over Pepperdine on Sunday, as the Women of Troy continue their season against Arkansas State on Wednesday at 7 p.m. and Nebraska on Friday at 2 p.m. Both games are at the Galen Center.
Arkansas State is currently unranked, while Nebraska is ranked No. 23.
The Women of Troy (1-1) were led by junior forward Cassie Harberts, who finished with 24 points and 10 rebounds against the Waves, and Ariya Crook, who scored 17 points in her first game of the season. She missed the season opener against Gonzaga because of a coach’s decision.
“I’m not settling on it,” said Crook about the team’s first win, “We have more work to do and we just have to continue on throughout the road.”
Harberts is averaging 21 points and 10 rebounds per game this year, leading USC in both categories. She’s the only player to score in double figures in both games. Crook is the only other player to score in double figures for USC. Co-captain senior forward Christina Marinacci is averaging 6.5 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.
The Women of Troy still have room to improve, however, as evidenced by 23 turnovers for the second-straight game. They also committed 23 turnovers and 18 fouls in a 63-52 loss to Gonzaga in the season opener.
USC has been strong on the boards this season, outrebounding Gonzaga 34-31 and Pepperdine 44-29. They have also come back strong after the half, outscoring their opponents 68-58 in the second half, despite being outscored 61-49 by opponents in the first half.
“I don’t think it was about the other team rattling us as much us our team trying to move a little faster than we should,” said USC coach Michael Cooper when asked about the turnovers.
Both Arkansas State (0-3) and Nebraska (3-1) will head to Los Angeles after games against Southeast Missouri (2-2) on Monday and against Sam Houston State (1-2) on Tuesday, respectively. Nebraska is undefeated at home but winless on the road.
Arkansas State is coming off  a 60-51 loss at home to Wichita State on Thursday. The team is led by Jane Morrill (13.0 points and 7.3 rebounds per game) and Carlisha Wyatt (11.3 points and 8.0 rebounds per game). The Red Wolves are coming off a 12-18 record from last season, and 6-10 in the Sun Belt conference. They finished fifth in the Sun Belt west division.
Nebraska lost 60-55 against South Dakota State, despite 21 points by Lindsey Moore and 15 points from Jordan Hooper, causing them to drop from 15th to 23rd in the NCAA rankings. Hooper is averaging 15.3 points and 9.3 rebounds per game this season, while Moore is averaging 14.0 points and 5.0 assists per game. The Cornhuskers finished 24-9 last season, 10-6 in the Big Ten, good for a sixth-place finish. They earned a the sixth seed in the NCAA tournament last season, only to be upset in the first round by 11th-seeded Kansas.
Friday’s game against Nebraska will be televised by the Pac-12 Networks.

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team has run through the gauntlet of its regular season  unscathed and is now set to begin postseason play in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championships. Tournament play opens Friday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, with what should be a pro-USC crowd on hand to watch the Trojans begin their run at an unprecedented fifth consecutive national championship.
On a roll · Junior driver Nikola Vavic leads USC with 74 goals this season — 20 more than second-ranked Kostas Genidounias. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
USC begins the tournament against UC Santa Barbara. The two teams have met twice this season already, once in the SoCal tournament championship game in Santa Barbara and once in a regular MPSF game at USC. The Trojans won each game by scores of 14-5 and 12-7, respectively.
In each contest, the Gauchos had trouble stopping striker Nikola Vavic. The star junior, who is rapidly moving up the USC record books, scored six goals in the first meeting and three in the second. Every opponent the team has faced this year has had little success in trying to slow down the Trojans’ leading goal-scorer, whose 72 goals are tops in the MPSF.
Should USC get past the first round, the team will most likely face No. 3 Stanford in the semifinals. The two meetings against the Cardinal this season were two of the toughest games of the season for the Trojans. The first meeting, which came in the NorCal tournament semifinals, was level after regulation before junior two-meter Jeremy Davie provided the deciding set in a thrilling match in Palo Alto.
The rematch was not as dramatic but equally competitive, with USC using a four-goal third quarter to create a lead that would prove enough in a 9-6 victory.
Led by senior driver Tobias Preuss’ three goals and junior goalie James Clark’s nine saves, USC swept the season series against Stanford despite each game being played in Stanford’s home pool. This time, should the matchup present itself, the Trojans will have a home-pool advantage.
The other top threat to the Trojans’ quest for a title is crosstown rival UCLA. Each match between the two schools this season was a one-goal affair, with the Trojans coming on top 7-6 in the first game and 10-9 in the second matchup. The first game was the NorCal tournament championship, in which Vavic knocked in four goals and Clark made 11 saves.
In the second game, played  last weekend, USC won in thrilling fashion thanks in large part to senior driver Michael Rosenthal’s late-game heroics in which he scored his third goal with just over two minutes remaining to give the Trojans a one-goal lead. That lead would hold up when the final buzzer sounded, cementing a perfect regular season with a record of 24-0.
The last time USC finished the regular season undefeated was in 2008. Before that, the Trojans capped off an undefeated 2006 regular season before tripping up against Cal in both the MPSF and NCAA championship games.
This year, the team is hoping to repeat the former, rather than the latter.

There are, in life, things that’ll always seem incomplete: a piece of art you can’t quite seem to add the finishing touch to or a home-cooked dish missing that spice giving it the extra kick. These circumstances puzzle us. We’re left scrambling to understand what is, in fact, missing. Why didn’t it turn out the way we hoped? Eventually, we’ll smile, shrug and hum along, and attempt to make the best of our efforts.
I imagine, in a way, this is how we’ll come to view the Matt Barkley era.
Unless the right-handed senior signal caller makes some sort of dramatic return for a December bowl game, we’ve watched him take his last snap under center in cardinal and gold. USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Sunday night that Barkley would miss the Trojans’ regular season finale against top-ranked, undefeated Notre Dame at the Coliseum because of an AC sprain suffered in last Saturday’s matchup at UCLA.
Let’s be honest, this might very well be it.
It’s odd, but for Barkley, who has started more games at quarterback than any player in school history, his career at USC feels like it’s still missing something.
That’ll forever remain the great irony of Matt Barkley. He’s thrown more completions, more yards and more touchdowns than any other USC or Pac-12 passer. But we’ll always be scrambling to provide meaning to his chapter in history.
No, 2012 — and his four-year career for that matter — didn’t unfold like we all thought it would. The portrait of Matt Barkley was to be without a blemish.
He was, as Kiffin put it last December, the “Perfect Trojan, Matty Trojan.” He was the blue-eyed, blonde-haired quarterback from Orange County who would rescue USC from its darkest hour — NCAA sanctions in June of 2010.
That was the narrative. That was what was expected, a feel-good story too good for even a Hollywood script. The Trojans’ 2012 season would be like some cinematic masterpiece with Barkley leading the program toward the top of the college football universe.
We’ve been expecting as much since he set foot on campus in January 2009 and was tapped as the starter seven months later. Noted then-coach Pete Carroll at the time: “He’s ready to be the guy for us.”
At 18, he was ready. Except — no matter how many touchdown passes he’s thrown since his first game against San Jose State on Sept. 5, 2009 — we’re still searching to uncover the context of his career.
It’s easier for others.
For Matt Leinart, it was consecutive national championships and a 34-game winning streak. For Carson Palmer, it was a Heisman Trophy and a berth in the Orange Bowl, underpinning a return to national prominence. For others such as Rodney Peete or Mark Sanchez, it was trips to the Rose Bowl, the “Granddaddy of Them All.”
But for Barkley, what does his career represent, exactly? He threw touchdown upon touchdown, but in what defining moment?
It’s of course difficult to fault him for the circumstances, but the circumstances are still there. For two of his four seasons, USC was prohibited from participating in the postseason.
Despite a 10-win season in 2011, there was no Pac-12 championship game or Rose Bowl berth. There were 12 regular season games and that was that.
We’ll always ask, “what if?” What if the conditions had been different? What if Carroll stayed? What if the NCAA penalties never arrived? What if the team survived road showdowns versus Stanford, Arizona and UCLA earlier this fall?
Much like the circumstances, his accomplishments are followed by a “but.” He threw for more than 100 touchdown passes over his career, but 23 came in games against Colorado and Syracuse. He orchestrated road wins over top-10 teams Ohio State and Oregon, but the former was followed by four losses during the season and the latter came in a year when USC wasn’t bowl eligible. Barkley and the Trojans began this season as the Associated Press’ preseason No. 1 team, but they’ve already stumbled four times.
In spite of the numbers, we’ve never quantified USC quarterbacks solely by statistics and by their records. No matter how many passes Heisman winners Leinart or Palmer launched, we remember certain moments: a pass on fourth-and-nine in the waning seconds of a win at Notre Dame, a smattering of Iowa in the Orange Bowl in January.
Barkley’s resume lacks that singularly defining play or game. It lacks that kick.
Maybe we’ll remember his unwavering commitment instead. It’s often been said Barkley said yes to USC three times: once in high school by signing a letter of intent, once in the wake of sanctions by declining to transfer and once in 2011 by opting to stay for his senior season, leaving NFL millions behind.
Maybe it’s the way he represented the university, organizing missionary trips to Africa and to earthquake-ravaged Haiti.
Maybe it’s the fact he helped keep USC above water when the program could’ve easily drowned.
Maybe it is the numbers, a sign he made the most of his play on the field during trying times.
“I played up and down,” Barkley said outside the visiting locker room following Saturday’s 38-28 loss to UCLA at the Rose Bowl. “I thought I fought as hard as I could’ve fought. I went down fighting.”
Though business will remain unfinished for Barkley, maybe his lasting legacy is that: he fought. He fought and fought tirelessly for four years. He fought when it could have been expedient not to. And that shouldn’t be undervalued.
But in five years or a decade from now, will we remember any of that?
 
“The 19th Hole” runs Tuesdays. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu.
Years from now, will we remember that he fought?
Absolutely.  As a proud Trojan alumna, I can say confidently that I will never forget Matt Barkley. I have never been more impressed with a Trojan player.  Some have more moments in the sun, yes.  But Barkley’s character, loyalty, and selflessness set him apart.
Barkley is a good football player, but he is a better person.
Our daughter started at USC at the same time Matt did, and although she subsequently transferred, we continue to be Trojans for Life. Like many in the Trojan Family we were impressed that Matt stayed at USC for his fourth year and had high hopes for he and the team this season. Unfortunately, both were relatively disappointing, but agree that Matt is  a fine young man and a credit to his parents and ultimately his university. At this point I sincerely hope that Matt becomes the greatest professional football quarterback to have ever played at USC, if that is his goal. He has certainly put in the work to prepare himself for the next level.
Matt is a great Trojan. He could have bailed to the NFL for the money, but he honored his commitment and continued his education, something rare these days by the lottery pick players. USC was lucky to have him. While I was happy to see him knocked around last Saturday by my Bruins, I will always respect his competiveness and desire to win. Good luck in the draft Mr Barkley, I expect you to do well on Sundays.
Dear Matt,
You are a great Trojan.
I’ve been to every game this season and have greatly enjoyed every moment of seeing you and the team play over the years.
While your play at USC as a football player will always be remembered.  For some reason, I have to think that your play in the game of life will greatly benefit from your time at USC.
There are very few people who can come out of four years of college where nearly 100% of the people are all thinking these positive things and feeling so appreciative of your efforts.
You have represented our university so well and you have endured so many pressures in performance, in life, and in the community.  And, you were not paid a dime for your work, which is clearly an selfless act of love for our alma mater.
Every alumnus that I have seen, know, or met this week is thinking the same thing.
Get well and thank you for being who you are.
We truly love you for everything you have given us over these years.
Fight on and get well!
And, BEAT THE IRISH!!!
Fight on!
No problem with the last sentence. It ends off what most of Matt’s career has been, a lot of fighting, but a lot of “buts”. Nobody has ever been remembered for how hard they fought.
I agree with the last sentence being entirely wrong for the article.  But I also want to thank Matt for giving of himself all of this time.  We loved watching you and thank you for giving us so much pleasure!  Fight On!
This column would be exponentially stronger without the last, utterly silly sentence.
Will Matt Barkley be remembered?  A resounding YES!!  His twitter page says it all……”I play quarterback but that doesn’t define me.”   Fight on, Matt!

Now unranked and without any prospects for a BCS bowl berth, USC finds itself playing the unfamiliar role of spoiler. In No. 1 Notre Dame and USC’s 84th all-time meeting, the Trojans will look to bust the BCS and tarnish what has been a remarkably successful year for the Fighting Irish, considering most pundits predicted 2012 would be a season of transition for the program.
New era · USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Sunday that redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek will start against Notre Dame after senior Matt Barkley sprained the AC joint in his right shoulder on a fourth-quarter sack at UCLA. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Though losers of three of their last four contests, the downtrodden Trojans can derive solace from the team’s history of ruining opponents’ undefeated seasons. USC has defeated a No. 1-ranked team seven times in its history. Two of those upsets — in 1938 and 1964 — occurred against No. 1 Notre Dame squads at the Coliseum.
USC’s 28-38 loss at UCLA left USC coach Lane Kiffin mostly speechless, as he struggled to explain another substandard outing. The Trojans outgained the Bruins in total yards 513 to 406, took six fewer penalties and sacked budding star quarterback Brett Hundley five times, while only permitting one sack of its own. But USC’s three turnovers — compared to UCLA’s one — proved insurmountable.
“Obviously a very discouraging game,” Kiffin said. “A very tough loss for our fans, for our players and for our staff.”
Adding injury to insult, senior quarterback Matt Barkley — on the one sack USC’s offensive line did relent — suffered a sprain of his right shoulder’s AC joint. Such injuries can require anywhere from two to eight weeks for recovery, so it’s conceivable that the beloved signal caller has seen his career with USC come to a premature end.
“I feel very bad for him and his family,” Kiffin said. “Obviously, this is not the way we pictured the team’s season going.”
Coincidentally, Barkley was also unable to play when Notre Dame last visited the Coliseum after he had suffered a high-ankle sprain. Former quarterback Mitch Mustain filled in for Barkley admirably, passing for 177 yards. Most fans, however, will remember the game as the one in which former wide receiver Ronald Johnson bobbled and dropped a surefire touchdown pass that would have allowed the Trojans to pull out the come-from-behind victory in the waning moments of the game. Instead, USC fell 20-16.
“It’s unfortunate for his career now that two times in a row Notre Dame has come into the Coliseum — and he’s gone to South Bend twice and won — and now he won’t be able to play them at home [ever],” Kiffin said.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek will replace Barkley in the starting lineup — a familiar role for Wittek, who succeeded Barkley in high school at Mater Dei.
“We have great confidence in Max,” Kiffin said. “He did well [Saturday] in a very difficult situation. Standing around for 3.5 hours in the rain and to go into that game is not easy to do.”
In limited duty this season against Hawaii, Colorado and UCLA, the 2010 four-star recruit has completed eight of nine passes for a touchdown. Despite Wittek’s lack of experience, Kiffin is confident that he will not have to simplify the game plan too much for the strong-armed gunslinger.
“We would be more apt to do what we normally do with Matt in there,” Kiffin said. “Matt and Max are pretty similar physically, so I think that we will pretty much stick within our system.”
Of course, facing Notre Dame’s stingy defense marks the toughest of first assignments for Wittek. The Fighting Irish rank first in the Football Bowl Subdivision in points allowed per game, surrendering an average of 10.1 per contest. Perhaps most impressively, the Fighting Irish limited Oklahoma, which averages 40.8 points per game, to just 13 points in their Oct. 27 matchup.
Senior linebacker Manti Te’o has deservedly garnered Heisman Trophy buzz, as the bruising defensive captain and former USC fan growing up has snagged six interceptions and racked up 98 tackles this season.
On offense, Notre Dame features dual-threat quarterback Everett Golson, who has completed 59 percent of his passes for 11 touchdowns and five interceptions while adding 258 yards and five touchdowns on the ground. Their two-headed monster of tailbacks Theo Riddick and Cierre Wood have combined for 1,454 yards and tight end Tyler Eifert — a big-time NFL prospect — leads the team in all major receiving categories.
Though the Trojans have faced more well-rounded and potent offenses during the Pac-12 regular season, there’s no question that Notre Dame’s defense will present USC’s offense with its stiffest challenge since the Stanford loss.
Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m. Saturday at the Coliseum. The game will be televised nationally on ABC.
SPOILER ROLE, This does not sit well with me. How did we get here? WAIT, i know, our defense sucks. It’s not like we are deficient in talent, so what is it?This is the question that all Trojan faithful should be asking themselves and don’t cringe when the answer seems upsetting. ” Above all to thine own self be true”. Don’t lie to yourself. Just like Lane and Barkley have to come to the conclusion that they’ve become predictable. There are more athletes on that team that can catch a ball other than Marquise Lee. I’ll always remember reading what Matt Lienart told JD Booty when he became the new starting quarterback. ” Distribute the ball, that’s your job” There seams to be a lack of ball distribution in this offensive plan. Perhaps another visit from Matt Lienart is in order?

University Gateway, a popular student housing option across the street from the University Park Campus at the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street, was sold in October for more than $200 million to a Wisconsin public employees pension fund.
Off the market · The apartment building, which was purchased for $200 million in October, contains 421 units with 1,656 beds. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Gateway, which charges about $1,000 a month per bed, was built by Los Angeles developer Urban Partners in 2010. The complex has 421 units with 1,656 beds and offers amenities including rooftop balconies, study rooms and a gym.
The deal was closed by the CBRE’s National Student Housing  Groups to Blue Vista Capital, which purchased the eight-story complex on behalf of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board.
The student housing was considered prime real estate, given its close proximity to campus, according to CBRE’s National Student Housing Group, which aided in closing the deal at the end of October.
“It is a high quality asset because its location is irreplaceable,” said Jacyln Fitts, the associate director of CBRE’s National Student Housing Group. “We worked as the brokerage firm that represented the Urban Partners who developed the property. We brought it to market in the spring of 2012 -… and then assisted them in selling the deal.”
Because of confidentiality, Fitts was unable to comment as to whether USC was approached about the building or whether the university put forward a bid.
Neither Gateway management nor the USC Real Estate & Asset Management were available for immediate comment.
Under the sale, Peak Campus Management, which manages more than 30,000 beds nationwide, will managed the property, according to Blue Vista Capital President JD Goering.
Though there will be a change in management, Goering assured that there is unlikely to be any major changes in management style.
“There will be no impact on students,” said Goering. “We’re going to look into some upgrades. Obviously, the property is pretty new so there’s not a lot that needs to really be done.”
Some Gateway residents believe management could improve operations. Isabel Khalili, a junior majoring in music industry, said Gateway’s new management has potential to better improve the complex’s allocation of resources.
“Gateway’s problem is that they hype it up,” said Khalili.  “It’s a brand new building, but it seems like they never really cared to finish it. The ceilings still look terrible. If I were living in an old house that were cheap, and if I had my own room I wouldn’t care as much, but I’m paying so much to live in these rooms that are basically unfinished.”
To Goering, the top priority is making the change in management as smooth as possible.
“It’s going to be a seamless transition,” Goering said. “Our goal … is really that the student doesn’t even know that anything has been disrupted. They might have to write their rent check to a different name, but hopefully the experience will be improved upon with strong customer service and maybe some amenity and upgrade changes that can be done in the future.”
At USC, student housing is a life or death matter as well as a core component of financial survival for many families of USC students.  I don’t care whether USC owns Gateway as long as the beds are full, students there are safe, and the prices don’t become even more outrageous. I do care whether USC leaders continue to shrink their duties to provide safe housing for USC students.  USC’s continued refusal to provide student housing will only lead to more dead or maimed students, more ratings drops, and more parents of brilliant students who can’t afford USC. The ultimate effect of all these negative impacts will be the replacement of USC’s leadership.
Has anyone figured out or care about the price per unit of this purchuse? It works out to about 475K per unit. At that price you could buy 421 houses in the ‘hood and still pay a commission.
The revenue must be pretty rich to justify that.
Just to make it clear from the other comments, Gateway has always been a private building.  No USC money was used in construction although USC does lease space on the ground floor for offices.
Gateway leases by the bed. Most private non-university housing providers are not able to do that (legally).
Leasing by the bed is common practice in University housing and is forbidden under Los Angeles’ rent control ordinance except for “dormitories”.
The $200M price recently paid for Gateway can only be justified by a high gross multiple achieved by a by “the bed” unit rate.
Blah blah blah….
Nice job letting this one get away USC.  Our students are assured more years of price gauging by private industry of students who are there compliments of USC.
Makes no sense to let someone else buy this.
Sorry but money is going towards new village.
How so? USC didn’t own it.; just leased it. I suppose the lease still is in effect.
What are you talking about? USC never leased Gateway…
From the Gateway web page:
“In June 2005 Urban Partners completed ground lease and sublease transactions with The Shammas Group and University of Southern California (USC) to develop a premier residential site for students of USC. Urban Partners then formed a joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate Advisors to develop 421 rental units that can provide up to 1,600 beds for USC students.”
More lies from the Cat Lady
as usual this old lady is full of it
I hate price gauging.
@ Vince,
No one forces you to live-in the “high-end” housing that has been built by private investors around the USC campus.   You certainly don’t need underground parking, pools, stainless steel kitchens with granite counter tops and in-building gym facilitates to attend college.   Don’t begrudge those who have seen the profit potential in this generation of overindulged kids and their foolish parents who seek to coddle them in comfort and accoutrements.
@ North University Park,
Meow!

USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Ernest J. Wilson III posed the hypothetical question of how W.E.B. Du Bois would respond to the impact of the “information revolution” on communities of color at an open forum Monday.
The event, titled “Exclusion and Inequality in Digital Societies: Theories, Evidence, and Strategy,” discussed the impact of the “information revolution” on the black community through the eyes of historian and American civil rights activist W.E.B Du Bois.
The discussion hypothesized that if Du Bois were alive today, he would urge society to research the relationship between information, technology and race. Wilson pointed out how we too are living in a transitional part of history, just as Du Bois lived during the transition from an agricultural to an industrial society between the mid-1800s and 1900s.
“We also live in a moment of transition,” Wilson said. “We are at the front end of a transition from an industrial society to an information society.”
One of the examples Wilson used to illustrate the relationship between the black population and technology was the 2012 presidential election. According to Wilson, President Barack Obama’s victory came in large part because of new technologies.
“[Obama] would not have won without the combination of a more diverse America married to IT,” Wilson said.
To Wilson, the only way to determine trends in racial and gender patterns is through the analysis of hard facts.
“We want a methodology which is structural, dynamic -— which recognizes qualitative changes in society,” Wilson said.
Wilson also highlighted the potentially inherent socio-economic bias prevalent in the media, specifically in regards to online advertising. According to Wilson, blacks owned only .7 percent of all commercial TV stations in 2011, a decrease from previous years.

After a volatile week of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians, students in support of Palestine (left) held a rally by Tommy Trojan on Monday. In response, students supporting Israel (right) held flags and signs across from the rally. Reactions to the gatherings ranged from confusion to support.
Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Congratulations, Israel. You have completely and utterly destroyed the lives of millions of people. Gaza is in rubble–no running water, no food, no power, no work, nowhere to live, no schools, no freedom, no dignity, NOTHING. 
As is the official Israeli Government position–You have strangled Gaza to death. 
Your God must be very pleased. These policies of Israel are a disgrace to humanity. 40% of Gaza is children under 14 years old. Of course they hate Israel–you have backed them into a corner and taken EVERYTHING from them.
Time to fess up, Israel– the enemy is you.
MURDER as cover for THEFT is *not* SELF-DEFENSE.
War historian Gwynn Dyer noted that everyone would support outlawing war as long as you get to choose the point at which you freeze the circumstances.
Although this is a non-biased review of the peaceful on-campus protests earlier this week, I think it is incredibly important to maintain an unbiased, factually supported stance. There is no such thing as Palestine. I’m neither for Israel nor for the Palestinians, but Palestine is not a country. Let’s not refer to it as such and cause confusion / spread fallacies.

In the recent election, California’s Proposition 30 to increase funding for public education and other state services passed by a narrow 54 percent majority vote. According to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday, the initiative, sponsored by Gov. Jerry Brown, passed because of overwhelming support from youth and minority voters.
The proposition increases personal income taxes for those earning more than $250,000 annually and raises sales tax by a quarter of a cent.
Fifty-eight percent of Latinos, 68 percent of blacks and nearly two-thirds of youth voters were in support of the education initiative, according to the poll.
“Give Jerry Brown credit,” Dan Schnur, director of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll and director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said in a statement. “The governor reached out aggressively to young voters and minority voters and gained their support in huge numbers.”
Many of those in favor said they voted for the proposition to avoid spending cuts to California schools. Additionally, 41 percent of voters said the proposition “temporarily raises income taxes on the highest earners in a balanced way that makes sure everyone pays their fair share.”
The passage of this proposition and others like it have led to an increase in approval ratings for Brown and more optimism among Californians, according to the poll. Though citizens previously considered the state to be “on the wrong track,” many more are now confident in Brown’s budget efforts and the direction he is leading the state in.
Lawrence Picus, a professor of education in the USC Rossier School of Education, said some younger voters likely supported the Prop. 30 out of concern for the education of future generations. Picus also said young voters, who tend to have lower incomes, might be less concerned about an income tax hike.
“The other way one might think about it is remember that income taxes are charged on very high incomes, but most young people probably don’t make that much money yet so it costs them less,” Picus said. “And because the sales tax increased, they thought it was worth making that commitment to pay a little more tax on the things they buy to ensure good schools.”
Sean Ely, a masters student studying in electrical engineering, stressed the importance of prioritizing education both in California and in the United States.
“The competitive advantage of the United States is [based on] our education system and being more technologically advanced, because we can’t really compete on manufacturing with other countries,” Ely said.
A public watchdog organization is needed to oversee the disbursement of Prop 30 funds, to ensure that all of the funds are spent on education, and does not go to Wall Street, does not go into the pockets of the Regents, and does not go into the general fund and from there to who knows where. The Governor of California cannot be trusted with Prop 30 funds, because Brown’s sister works for Goldman Sachs and because Brown is on the Board of regents for the University of California. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs appear to be the “vampire quids” in the swaps scam.

Cornbread Casserole
If you are looking for an easy and impressive side dish to take to your Thanksgiving gathering, cornbread casserole is a must. This tasty side dish puts an innovative twist on an American classic.

1 (15 oz.) can whole kernel corn, drained and 1/2 of liquid preserved
1 (14 3/4 oz.) can cream-style corn
2 eggs
1 (8 oz.) package dry cornbread mix
1 cup sour cream
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients until blended completely. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm with butter.
 
Green Stuff
For all of you home cooks that like to experiment with unique combinations of ingredients, try “Green Stuff” Marshmallow Salad.  This fun and flavorful dessert is not your typical mystery dish: The creamy pudding and soft marshmallows make this sugary treat highly enjoyable.
This recipe is not only easy to make, but also can be fun for aspiring chefs of any age. “Green Stuff” remains affordable and family-friendly, as well as an ideal dish for a party.  Making a double or triple portion of this dish creates an excellent way to accommodate a large number of guests, especially if you are cooking on a budget.

Ingredients
2 (3 1/2 oz.) boxes pistachio-flavored instant pudding
1 (20 oz.) can crushed pineapple, with juice
1 (10 1/2 oz.) bag mini marshmallows
1 1/2 (8 oz.) containers Cool Whip
1/2 cup maraschino cherries, diced
In a large mixing bowl, combine the pistachio pudding and crushed pineapple. Next, add the marshmallows to the mix. Fold in the Cool Whip and cherries until the mixture is blended completely. Chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour before serving cold.
 
Pepper Roasted Potatoes
A surprisingly simple side dish or appetizer, these potatoes are best prepared in an oven (marked with “a” in the recipe below) but can easily be prepared  in a microwave (marked with “b”) if short on time or oven space. Borrowed from a family chicken recipe, Pepper Roasted Potatoes should have a hefty dose of spice for lots of flavor. The recipe can be adjusted to taste; the potatoes have a natural flavor of their own, even with an absence of seasoning. Hosts who are accommodating guests with a low tolerance for spiciness can substitute rosemary or plain salt for flavor, or simply simmer some store-bought gravy in a saucepan to accompany the potatoes.
Ingredients
1/2 lb. potatoes, any variety
Olive oil
Multi-pepper blend or seasoning salt
Baking pan
Large sealable container
1a. Preheat oven to 450 F.
2. Cut potatoes into large, evenly sized chunks.
3. Pour a medium amount of olive oil into a large bowl. Add plenty of pepper blend or seasoning salt.
4. Add potato chunks to bowl. Toss carefully with hands until potato chunks are evenly coated, adding olive oil and pepper as necessary. (Having enough olive oil in the bowl to begin with reduces the mess at this juncture. Any cooking oil will do, but olive oil is best for flavor).
5a. Place potato chunks evenly on baking pan, lined with optional aluminum foil for easier cleanup.
5b. Or place potato chunks in a large microwaveable bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, leaving a small gap to vent steam.
6a. Bake potatoes in oven for 30 minutes or until done, turning occasionally. (Potatoes should be easily pierced by a fork in the middle.)
6b. Microwave potatoes for nine minutes or until done. A healthy coating of oil on the potatoes is recommended at this stage.
7. Put potatoes into a large sealable container and add plenty of pepper blend. Seal container tightly and shake until potato chunks are evenly coated.
8. Pour seasoned potato chunks into a serving dish if desired. Serves two.
 
Iced Peaches with Filling
These peaches are a healthy and light dessert dish to finish off any meal without adding too much richness.  The recipe is simple — take a piece of pitted fruit (peaches are used here, but plums will also work), remove the pit and replace it with some form of sweet filling. Dessert chefs who want to give this dish a personal touch are free to make their own judgments as to what kind of filling to use. Some options include ice cream, jam, sorbet or even small candies. This recipe uses basic spray whipped cream  for maximum lightness and ease of preparation. The ambitious can try to reseal the peach halves together with fondant or some other sticky spread, but for the purposes of keeping the serving size manageable and the eating process neat, this is not advised.
Ingredients
1 fresh large peach, whole, preferably firm
Spray can of whipped cream
1. Using a sharp fruit knife, cut the peach in half. Cutting axially makes pit removal easier, but cutting around the equator gives a better cavity for filling.
2. Separate the two halves by gently twisting.
3. Carefully pry out the pit with the point of a knife.
4. (Optional) Expand the cavity by cutting out some of the center of the peach, leaving more room for filling.
5. Spray whipped cream into the center cavity of each peach half.
6. Place on a tray and freeze until it’s time for dessert. Serves two.

Tito’s Tacos. La Taquiza. Pink’s.
Just saying the names of these eateries can get plenty of Angelenos’ mouths watering. For the grease, meat, tortilla and bun lovers of the city, the taco and hot dog joints dotting L.A. streets quickly become favorites known through word of mouth: There’s only one Tito’s Tacos in the city, but out-of-towners will make the commute to the famous L.A. locale to grub on the culinary treats.
Food, then, is a huge part of the city. When you see a sign for one of these famous eateries, you automatically think Los Angeles. This theme rings especially true in artist Restitution Press’ latest show, “Restitution Taco,” up now at C.A.V.E. Gallery. The artist, also known as Ryan Graeff, teamed up with website L.A. Taco to focus on the huge presence of taco trucks, restaurants and other food services in the city.
The show’s pieces include iconic signs from these locales, but also go beyond tacos to include other familiar images of the city, like Pink’s Hot Dogs. Here, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Broadway Boulevard, street lamps and more come together to create recognizable characteristics of the city.
The piece “Forever Los Angeles,” a collaboration with artist RALOS, presents a mixed media version of Los Angeles’ familiar features. The work’s colors make it feel like an evening scene, perhaps right before the moment when darkness sets in. A bridge takes over most of the composition, and the left side shows a street lamp and signs that read “Historic Downtown” and “Broadway.” Tall buildings in the background hint at the rest of the city, the skyscrapers creating the crowded atmosphere of Downtown Los Angeles. Above the urban landscape floats graffiti-esque letters spelling out “forever Los Angeles.”
The subdued colors make the piece feel like a yellowed photo from an old album, a remembrance of a city from decades ago. The phrase “forever Los Angeles” adds to the idea of looking back at a Los Angeles from another era, yet many of the images feel modern, especially in the graffiti-like parts of the piece. In other areas, bubbly letters with eyes decorate the bottom corners of the canvas and even peek out from behind the bridge. The images recall current graffiti work under fixtures such as bridges. The inclusion of graffiti lettering in the work suggests that it is an equally important signifier of the city’s personality. For street artists, a piece might disappear the very next day after going up, but Los Angeles’ walls are endless, allowing street artists to create more works of art on this bricked canvas. The city continues to inspire street artists such as Restitution Press — a fact that very much exemplifies the phrase “forever Los Angeles.”
Two colors drip across the rest of the piece, as if suggesting that all the images we see on the canvas might one day disappear — but the medium with which Restitution Press and many others create never changes. The colors in the work do not echo the realistic hues of the actual icons in their natural city environment, which makes the work very much the vision of Restitution Press. The artist transforms the cityscape into his own artistic vision, integrating familiar Los Angeles characteristics with his own color.
This also helps the work speak to artists as well as Angelenos. In the scope of art history, it’s not hard to find artists — such as Ed Ruscha — working on the iconography of the city and their own interpretation of Los Angeles as a complex metropolis. Yet every time a new vision arises, it differs from that of its predecessors. Each artist can take predictable images of the city and transform them into something that showcases his or her unique aesthetic.
“Forever Los Angeles” lends the city a feeling of timelessness. With this piece, it seems the city will live on forever, and as art continues to depict the best of the metropolis — including the best taco and hot dog joints — it most certainly will. The repetition of the arches in the bridge echoes that sentiment, as the image appears to continue outside the canvas just as the city continues outside the gallery where the piece hangs.
Now, Downtown Los Angeles serves as a hub for art both indoors and outside. Restitution Press reflects that overtaking of the city — the sense that it’s hard to walk through the streets of Downtown and not see a work of art among the expected features such as skyscrapers.
The viewers that encountered Restitution Press’ works most likely recognized a part of their city — like their favorite taco spot or even just a classic element or two of the city. If art reflects life, “Forever Los Angeles” encapsulates the idea that the city contains a unique identity that lives on through the passage of time. Though some buildings might change, the city’s potential for creativity will not. Each of the pieces in “Restitution Taco” further cements the idea that because Los Angeles presents so much for its citizens to explore, it offers a lot of inspiration for artists. With delicious tacos to munch on and a diverse cityscape to absorb, the City of Angels’ artists should find plenty to help them create.
 
“Restitution Taco” runs until Dec. 9 at C.A.V.E. Gallery, located at 1108 Abbot Kinney Blvd.

Romantic comedies are often classified in modern day cinema as laughable “chick flicks” with no true thematic meaning and very little emotional authenticity. And for the most part, this popular belief is true: Many romantic comedies are released solely for the purpose of profiting from female audience viewership and have no real artistic motive behind them. The advertising for this fall’s Silver Linings Playbook, thus far, has presented the film in a manner that might have triggered these cliche conventions in some viewers’ minds.

Yet, David O. Russell’s newest narrative can barely even be classified as a romantic comedy. A more proper categorization would be a comedy with heavy dramatic moments mixed in with romantic elements. Russell utilizes the romance of the two central characters not as the primary subject, but rather as a vehicle for allegorical representation.
Based on Matthew Quick’s novel of the same title, Silver Linings Playbook follows the story of Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), a mentally ill Philadelphian who has reached a low point in his life. Following a violent episode involving his wife and her lover, Pat is sentenced to a state institution and stripped of every happiness he previously had — a wife, a home and a job. The film begins as Pat returns to society and rebuilds relationships with his family, including his mother (Jacki Weaver) and his father (Robert De Niro).
The remaining length of the movie tracks Pat as he attempts to rebuild his life, piece together his marriage and establish a constructive philosophical outlook. Pat’s progress is greatly disrupted, however, when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), an equally distraught counterpart. The relationship of these two supposedly “ill” individuals becomes the emotional core of Silver Linings Playbook and pays off with surprisingly beneficial results for each character.
Few films succeed on multiple levels like Silver Linings Playbook. Russell’s script works as a drama and comedy, balancing both in a manner that mirrors reality. Humor can be found following even the dreariest of moments, just as one favorable instant can take a turn for the worse in the next. Russell displays this sincerity without interrupting the audience’s emotions mid-tear or mid-laugh. The dialogue remains witty and full of heart, never crossing the unfortunate boundary of mocking mental disturbances.
Often, films centered around protagonists with mental illnesses make use of fictional elements in order to  soften the realities of insanity — usually for positive reception from audiences. Such cinematic pieces portray their ill subject with enough of a noticeable defect, but not to the point in which the disease becomes laughable. Russell guides Silver Linings Playbook near the borders of acceptable maniac dramatization, however, and luckily  never crosses them. The audience does not laugh at the manifestations of Pat’s illness, but rather at the absurdity of his actions. It’s an extremely difficult line to judge; nevertheless, Russell, thanks to incredible performances from the quartet of lead actors, toes the line with precision.
The role of Pat represents an interesting departure from the norm for Cooper. But despite the new challenge, Cooper masters Russell’s dialogue with comical, unfiltered mannerisms wrapped in a grounded exaggeration of insanity. Cooper never injects Pat with so much craziness that his character comes off as overtly fictional — instead, Cooper’s performance has an understated madness that only reveals itself in heightened bursts of drama. By restraining himself to hyperactivity in climactic scenes, the duplicity of Pat’s character is displayed to its fullest extent. Cooper brings a complex realism to Pat that lends itself to both the comedic and dramatic aspects of the film.
Lawrence’s interpretation of Tiffany perfectly complements Cooper’s Pat; she remains gloomy, compulsive and seductive with a splash of bipolarity. The tragedy Tiffany experienced and the effects it had on her mental stability comes through in Lawrence’s monotone, apathetic voice. Her eyes and facial expressions also wonderfully illustrate a broken heart and a deep longing for companionship, and Lawrence’s chemistry with Cooper is palpable; their banter is often sharply humorous and counteracted by arguments that tug on every emotional thread of the audience’s collective heart. Lawrence’s work in Silver Linings Playbook marks another highlight in a young career already filled with great performances.
Though they only appear in select scenes, De Niro and Weaver truly add a powerful emotional dimension to this film. De Niro, who sadly hasn’t had a memorable role in years, delivers a tremendously honest and true portrayal as Pat Sr. He alludes to seeds of mental illness in his character, and his performance reveals the emotional conflicts of a father unable to aid his son. Weaver, who only has a handful of scripted lines, shows the real care and concern of a mother through her compassionate actions rather than her words. Both parents’ interactions with their son feel completely genuine and provide a glimpse at how disconnected  this family is.
The flaws of Silver Linings Playbook lie in the conventions of its genre. The storyline gets a bit convoluted toward the third act, which begins to draw away some sincerity from the plot. But though the conclusion is predictable, it remains emotionally powerful and is beautifully filmed.
Silver Linings Playbook eloquently demonstrates the value of cinema. The narrative remains positively uplifting in a wonderful, triumphant portrait of love, family and happiness.

Director Ang Lee knows how to tell grand, moving stories rife with poignant imagery and subtlety. He displayed it in his Oscar-winning film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which deftly wove romance and epic adventure with breathtaking scenery. Then Lee did it again in Brokeback Mountain, the tragic story of two gay star-crossed lovers that garnered him his second Academy Award, this time for directing.
Lost at sea · In Ang Lee’s Life of Pi, Pi Patel and his tiger, Richard Parker, battle the forces of nature when a freighter ship sinks in the Pacific Ocean. The film uses top-of-the-line CGI effects to create impressive visuals. – | Photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox
But Lee has reached serious new heights with Life of Pi, a thrilling adaptation of Yann Martel’s 2001 bestselling novel of the same name. It’s indicative of his talent that a director with an eye for shooting beautiful sequences has created his most gorgeous and lush film yet. But as with the novel, the most compelling aspect of Life of Pi is the layers of metaphor and narrative nuance evident in thoughtful details that also make the film one of the best of 2012.
Life of Pi tells the story of Piscine Molitor “Pi” Patel (newcomer Suraj Sharma), a boy raised in Pondicherry, India by parents who own a small zoo. As with the novel, a middle-aged Pi (played by veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan) serves as the narrator; the film sets up the story by introducing a nameless author (Rafe Spall) who is curious about Pi’s tale.
In a series of whimsical episodes, Life of Pi shows its protagonist grow from a precocious youngster to a deeply spiritual and dedicated teenager at peace with his life in Pondicherry. Unfortunately for Pi, his father decides that for financial purposes, the family must move from India to Canada and sell their zoo animals.
It’s a journey that requires loading up on a freighter ship, whose size and seafaring history are reassuring up until the point it mysteriously sinks. Pi is ostensibly the only human to make it out alive, accompanied on a lifeboat by a head-scratching assortment of zoo animals comprising a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and, most significantly, the zoo’s prized Bengal tiger.
The sinking of the freighter, for one, stands as one of the most impressive cinematic disaster sequences in recent memory, both exhilarating and tragic in its disorienting violence; it’s hard not to get chills when the camera frames the silhouette of Pi underwater as he watches the ship slowly fall into the depths of the Pacific.
In fact, it would be fair to suggest that the film would’ve been worth the ticket price just for the visual feast alone. Surreal-looking shots of Pi floating on a beautifully hued, mirrorlike ocean are likely to leave many in the audience slack-jawed; meanwhile, the incredible effects used to animate Richard Parker make it nearly impossible to believe that he’s not a real Bengal, even in extreme close-ups of his bestriped maw.
But Lee extends his vision beyond such obvious shots, weaving the film with surprising visual virtuosity even in moments of quieter backstory exposition. Though the bar was set high by James Cameron’s Avatar, a landmark film for 3-D and CGI technology, Life of Pi shines in how it utilizes both technologies in such naturalistic ways. Both digital techniques look equally at home depicting a dreamy sequence at a French resort as showing a brutal storm at sea, which is a credit to cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Tron: Legacy, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and visual effects producer Susan MacLeod.
Life of Pi is so much more than just visuals, however — thanks to Lee’s perfect cast. The supporting actors all carry their weight well; Adil Hussain, who plays Pi’s father, shows off his measured rationality and temper particularly effectively, including in a scene where he shows Pi why he mustn’t ever try to play with Richard Parker.
That brings us to the film’s MVP, Sharma. In an impressive feat of irony, Sharma originally had no plans to audition for the film and even forgot his lines in front of Lee. But it wouldn’t be quite fair to call the young actor a diamond in the rough: Sharma’s already a brilliant gem in Life of Pi, infusing the lead role with raw intensity and charisma. It’s almost shocking to realize Sharma’s lack of experience when watching him break down in desperation while cradling a CGI tiger. Yet he pulls it off time and time again, effectively channeling themes of faith and humanity in times of darkness.
Though Sharma’s pure talent obviously played a huge role in his performance, his success also serves as a testament to Lee’s ability as a director. Lee himself expressed doubt about adapting such an ambitious novel to the screen, especially because of its deep themes and mind-twisting ending. And if there is a fault to the film, it’s that it sometimes feels merely like a beautiful adventure rather than the thought-provoking treatise on existentialism some might desire.
But then again, it just might be a part of Lee’s genius that he has wrapped a deeply insightful essay on humanity in a glittering cascade of visual brilliance. Now the hard part — finding meaning in it all — is left to the viewer.

The arguments claiming that decriminalizing marijuana will end the influence of Mexican drug cartels and bring in billions of dollars in tax revenue are incessantly echoed in America — and both were strategically used this year to successfully convince voters to legalize the drug in Washington and Colorado.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Students, especially, have been quick to embrace these arguments and are at the forefront of the movement to end the prohibition of marijuana. Young adults ages 18 to 29 are twice as likely to favor legalization than adults over 60, according to a 2011 Gallup poll.
But the reasoning for both of these talking points is faulty and unsound, and ends up distracting American voters from the negative consequences of recreational marijuana use.
First and foremost, the notion that legalizing marijuana will stop drug violence in Mexico and along the U.S. border is fatuous. The Office of National Drug Control and Policy estimates that drug cartels derive 61 percent of their revenue from marijuana. The idea that drug cartels will be complacent with a dented bottom line is inconceivable.
Though this number is certainly significant for cartels’ bottom lines, it also leaves a gigantic portion of revenue from dealing other illicit drugs unaddressed. Stanford University professor Keith Humphreys determined that if marijuana was legalized across the United States, cartels would adapt and make as much profit on heroin and methamphetamine individually as they would on marijuana. The same projection shows cocaine making up more than one-third of cartels’ revenues. Thus, cartels could respond to legalized marijuana by focusing on moving harder drugs, such as heroin, meth and cocaine. Police forces both inside and outside the United States will have to continue to crack down on drug cartels, efforts which will continue to cost taxpayers.
It is also commonly argued that as America’s most valuable cash crop, marijuana will bring in a large amount of tax revenue for the U.S. government. In 2006, ABC News reported that with “a value of $35.8 billion, marijuana exceeds the combined value of corn and wheat.” But this figure was calculated — in a report published by Jon Gettman, director of the Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis — based on an estimated street value of $1,600 per pound. Once legalized, the price of marijuana could decrease by 80 percent, according to the nonpartisan RAND Drug Policy Research Center. Thus, many boasted revenue projections could be grossly exaggerated.
Nevertheless, both of these arguments — that legalizing marijuana will end the war on drugs and bring in billions of dollars in tax revenue — are constantly used to distract from the negative consequences of marijuana use. For students, these consequences are especially pertinent. Research shows that teenagers who smoke pot on a regular basis consistently do worse in school and are twice as likely to drop out of high school. A CBS article published in August said that smoking marijuana as a teenager corresponds to an average IQ drop of eight points — which lowered the substance-using student’s IQ rate in comparison to the average student’s by double-digit percentage points.
Even for older users, there are significant side effects to recreational marijuana use. A landmark study published in February by Dalhousie University in Canada found that using marijuana within three hours of driving doubles the likelihood of causing a car crash. Additionally, marijuana contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke, potentially increasing users’ chances of developing cancer. And in September, USC scientists published a study linking recreational marijuana use among males to a dangerous form of testicular cancer.
Whether any of these side effects justify criminalizing marijuana is certainly open to question, but it is imperative that students are wise enough to question common talking points and focus on the true consequences of legalization. There is no doubt that current college students’ reasoning will play an instrumental role in the future of America’s drug policies. The way our generation handles this first hurdle will have long-reaching implications for decades to come.
 
Ryan Townsend is a sophomore majoring in business administration. His column “The Blame Game” runs Tuesdays.
I find it interesting that the name of this article is “Marijuana debate clouds reality” You’d think that someone going to a private school would know better. FOLLOW THE MONEY! The real reason for it’s villainous status was caused by the Pacific northwest logging industries quest to monopolize the paper mills in America. Yah that’s right. It’s about money once more. The industry lobbied to get marijuana or “hemp” outlawed. Not for it’s pshyco-active properties, but for it’s ability to make paper so readily. You could grow plants every season and have a new crop every season. Interestingly enough, The medical industry was convinced to vote in the direction of the loggers then realized their mistake to late. They (medical industry) were using it for its medical qualities. Imagine telling the American people that I have maybe the second best way to make paper so vote for me. Yah, you see, that bird won’t fly. The only way to convince the American people to outlaw this plant was to call it the devil’s weed. One toke and you became this minion of evil. Reality? I guess it’s subjective. The prohibition on marijuana has been a disaster at best. Millions of people use it and the war on it has cost BILLIONS since it’s outlawing. So why should a financially strapped state fit the bill for a lie.
It’s a shame Ryan Townsend wants us to support the gangs and cartels that sell marijuana to children and perpetrate violence. Why do you support the black market instead of regulated outlets? Since the main result of this is that gangs and cartels keep their lucrative market selling to children with no competition from legal suppliers who don’t, one wonders why Ryan Townsend wants children to have greater access to marijuana? Or does he  just prefer gangs and cartels to legal regulated supplies?
As for the health effects on seniors, let’s cut to the chase. 
The largest study of the health effects of marijuana ever done was by Kaiser Permanente. They surveyed the health records of 65,000 patients over a period of years. They found no significant differences in the health records of pot smokers versus non-pot-smokers. 
Their conclusions fundamentally agree with every major government commission report on the subject — marijuana may have various dangers, but none of them amounts to a serious danger to most individuals, or to the public health. Furthermore, those dangers are nothing by comparison to other common legal items, such as alcohol, tobacco, and cheeseburgers. 
In short, the health issues of cannabis just don’t amount to a rational argument for prohibiting it. Think it over while cheeseburger juice drips down your chin.
That is not to mention that this idea confuses “drugs are bad” with “prohibition is good.” The two are not the same. See alcohol for the best example.
“Research shows that teenagers who smoke pot on a regular basis consistently do worse in school and are twice as likely to drop out of high school. A CBS article published in August said that smoking marijuana as a teenager corresponds to an average IQ drop of eight points — which lowered the substance-using student’s IQ rate in comparison to the average student’s by double-digit percentage points.”
First, this never had anything to do with the marijuana laws. These kinds of ideas were made up only when people stopped believing that mj will turn you into a bat. 
As for the study:
1) The relevant group consisted of ten people — as opposed to much larger studies which have shown no such thing.
2) The difference in IQ is about half the standard deviation of most IQ tests. In other words, it is less than the normal variation you would expect if the same person took the test multiple times.
3) There is no real indication of causality or control for other variables.
4) We have had tens of millions of teenagers smoking pot for decades now. If there was a real problem, we wouldn’t be guessing based on the results from ten people at this late date.
And so forth.
That is not to mention that the idea wouldn’t make a good justification for prohibiting it for adults, even if it was true. That is not to mention that there is no evidence that prohibition would help any of the supposed problems with kids, either. Historically speaking, the biggest single cause of drug epidemics among US children is anti-drug campaigns. You can read about a number of examples at http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cumenu.htm
“Once legalized, the price of marijuana could decrease by 80 percent, according to the nonpartisan RAND Drug Policy Research Center. Thus, many boasted revenue projections could be grossly exaggerated.”
What is the difference between a 25-cent cigar and a 25-dollar cigar? What is the difference between a 2 dollar bottle of wine and a 200-dollar bottle of wine? 
If you care to spend some time in marijuana dispensaries you will see something interesting. A finely grown, shaped, and trimmed bud may sell for fifty dollars per eighth. If you take the same bud and simply crumble it between your fingers, the maximum sale price is cut in half. It is the exact same product — except for how it looks — and the price is instantly halved. Ponder that in your marketing classes.
Marijuana growers will tell you that it takes quite a bit of labor and expense to produce mj that the buyers really want. The buyers will tell you that they aren’t as price-sensitive as one might think. They are willing to pay good prices for good flavor.
“The idea that drug cartels will be complacent with a dented bottom line is inconceivable.”
I have always found this line of reasoning to be highly amusing. In other words, we have to keep marijuana illegal so the profit margins will be high so the drug gangs (look up “cartel” for the proper use) will make a lot of money and won’t be tempted to do something worse.
In other words, marijuana prohibition is really a full-employment campaign for criminals. We have to make sure that they make a lot of money, so they won’t bother us with something else. 
You are a business major, so let me give it to you in the simplest business terms. Mj legalization will likely cut more than half of their total revenue. That’s a good thing, any way you slice it.
But let’s frame it as a simple business question. The estimates vary, but all the estimates agree that the marijuana business is worth tens of billions per year. There are only three choices for who will run the business, make all the rules for production and sales, and collect all the billions that come from it. The choices are:
1) Government, with proper regulations and taxes to address social problems.
2) Private business, with proper regulations and taxes to address social problems.
3) Organized crime, with no regulations or taxes to address social problems.
Please explain why you think organized crime is the best choice and will give us the best control over all the related social problems.
“the negative consequences of recreational marijuana use.”
You have made a common logical error. You have confused the idea of “drugs are bad” with the idea “prohibition is good.” The first does not prove the second. 
The best example is alcohol. Alcohol is clearly bad for society. That doesn’t mean that alcohol prohibition was a good idea. In fact, alcohol prohibition only made all the problems worse. See http://druglibrary.org/prohibitionresults.htm for some good info on that. 
As some of the major studies have noted the reasoning you used is exactly backwards. The more dangerous you assume a drug to be, the more important it becomes to treat it in a non-punitive manner. The reason is that making it a crime just drives the problem underground, where it is harder to deal with the problems. Alcohol prohibition was one good example of that.
Here are your reading assignments so you can get a better understanding of the issues.
Start with Licit and Illicit Drugs at http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cumenu.htm  This is the best overall review of the drug problem ever written. It has been used as basic college textbook for decades. It will explain how we got into this mess.
Then read the Drug Hang-Up at http://druglibrary.org/special/king/dhu/dhumenu.htm  This is another excellent history, written by a former president of the American Bar Association. He once formed a committee with the American Medical Association to study US drug policy. He found out that was a big mistake. The US Government does not like objective analysis of its drug policy. He tells the story in this book.
Then you should read “Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding” the report of the US National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse at http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm  This is the largest study of the marijuana laws ever done, commissioned and staffed by President Nixon, who started the modern drug war. 
Then look around the site and you can find such things as numerous other histories, such as the history of the start of the DEA, the full transcripts of the congressional hearings for the Marihuana Tax Act, and the full text of every major government commission report on the drug laws from around the world over the last 100 years. 
The references above will give you a good summary of what you would learn if you read all the rest.
If you will care to look around at other places on the internet where this subject is debated, you will discover that no prohibitionist has survived in this debate in more than twenty years. The major prohibitionist groups admitted several years ago that they have completely lost this debate on the internet, so they don’t even try anymore. Lately, some of the major prohibitionist groups have even offered their own plans for legalization – simply because they now see legalization as inevitable.
How can you deny the enjoyment of nature’s gift to humanity?
The prohibition of Earth’s most widely beneficial plant species is  a crime against humanity.  It shall NOT stand.
all of these arguments are void due to the fact that ALCOHOL is legal.
While it’s true that cannabis smoke contains carcinogens, current research is showing that it is actually less likely to produce cancer than tobacco smoke:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277837/
The author of the study goes on to say, “It should be noted that with the development of vaporizers, that use the respiratory route for the delivery of carcinogen-free cannabis vapors, the carcinogenic potential of smoked cannabis has been largely eliminated.”
Carcinogens in cannabis are produced when the material is pyrolyzed (burned), and can be avoided by using other routes of administration. As the price of cannabis goes down you’ll find more people eating it rather than smoking it, thus avoiding exposure to carcinogens present only in smoked cannabis.
Can the same be said of tobacco?
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120822100811.htm (First Identification of a Strong Oral Carcinogen in Smokeless Tobacco)
Also, Ryan Townsend’s contention that, “the notion that legalizing marijuana will stop drug violence in Mexico and along the U.S. border is fatuous, ” is reasonable. Cartels would not be stopped if cannabis were to be legalized tomorrow. However, most proponents of cannabis legalization aren’t claiming the cartels will be stopped, only that a significant proportion of their revenues will be cut. But this is a necessary step to take, especially considering the fact that prohibition simply isn’t reducing drug use anywhere.
The main reason for changing current policy is that it is none of the federal gov’s business what who grows and/or smokes. We are sovereign people not subjects or property.
If you are seeking an opportunity to get into this industry be warned, you cannot unless you already have two years residency in Colorado. BUT, there is an exciting way for you to make some money by lending to the industry. As they said in the report there are no banks who will lend to dispensaries, no matter how much profit they generate. That’s where you come in… if you can lend $25,000 to $250,000 for a short time and you want to earn an interest rate from 10% to 30% then please contact me today at: mmjviceroy at g mail.com
Then you can tell all your friends you are “in” the medical marijuana industry and more importantly you can help sick patients get access to the same high potency cannabis they purchase now for less money than they pay today.
And since you mentioned the “negative consequences of marijuana use”, why don’t we take a look at how the prohibition protects us from them.  Well, as the prohibition *doesn’t* prevent millions of Americans from using marijuana it’s pretty apparent that it doesn’t protect us from them at all! 
In fact, because our stores aren’t allowed to legally sell marijuana to adults they therefore aren’t able to undercut the drug dealers’ prices so we have drug dealers on our streets selling marijuana to CHILDREN. So your beloved prohibition actually puts our children at MORE risk of the “negative consequences of marijuana use”. Thanks Ryan.
If there’s one thing that seventy years of prohibition has taught us it’s that we CAN’T stop people smoking marijuana. So, given the facts of the last seven decades, what do you think is more harmful – legally-grown marijuana sold to adults in licensed establishments or illegal weed sold to kids on the street? Remember, drug dealers don’t card, supermarkets do.
Ryan, your logic is extremely flawed. What business do you know of could survive with 60% of its income gone? It costs the cartels a *lot* to pay bribes, buy weapons and pay their hitmen. Without the marijuana money they simply aren’t going to have enough cash flow to stay in business.
And no, they won’t be able to just sell more meth, coke and heroin to make up the lost income. They may *want* to sell more but if they increase supply without demand also increasing then they’re just going to drive down prices and erode their profit margins. And think about what the impact of legal weed is going to have on the demand for other drugs – since all drugs (including alcohol) are “substitute goods” for each other, legalizing marijuana is going to REDUCE the demand for the very drugs that the cartels are going to need to sell more of. So no, the cartels are NOT going to be able to replace 60% of their incomes through increased sales of harder drugs.
Think about this – how many bootleggers have you heard of lately? Legalizing adult alcohol sales drove alcohol prices down to the point where illegal suppliers couldn’t compete anymore – that’s the sole reason we legalized alcohol. And the exact same thing is going to happen to the drug dealers and cartels when we legalize adult marijuana sales.
If you don’t support Legalization you support the status quo of prohibition and that is something that I can not understand. Prohibition has been a TOTAL failure; costing us tax payers trillions of dollars over decades of failure and nothing to show for it but more use and abuse across the board. If you don’t support legalizing Marijuana then what do you suggest? It’s easy to say, na that’s not going to work because you are all pot heads so then what’s the solution then? Because prohibition has obviously failed, what the alternative to prohibition?? Funny how none of these articles saying legalization won’t work show any other alternatives.
Some people will continue to try to keep in place the stupidest law in history.  Maybe this story can fly on Fox News but it isn’t going to work on the internet.
Its a great thing that liars such has this author are becoming less and less influential…..
What this author fails to mention are the lives and famlies destroyed over a plant that has never killed anyone…..
He also fails to mention that 80% of marijuana users are white and 75% of drug prisoners for marijuana are black…..
Hey moron students werent tricked into voting for it…….your way is FAR FAR FAR more of a destructive policy than legalization would ever be……
Love these idiots who’ve never smoked it are experts

It might seem like the Republican Party got a little less extreme last week when Massachusetts Republicans voted to amend their rigid anti-abortion platform and endorse one that allows abortion in certain cases, such as rape and incest. But instead of taking a step forward, this stance further complicates the issue of abortion in ways that degrade and oppress American women.
The problem with the Massachusetts GOP’s new platform is that if a woman’s right to have an abortion depends on whether or not she was raped, someone has to decide whether or not she was raped. This decision, however, certainly will not be made by the woman herself. To qualify for the exemption, the victim would be required to prove to law enforcement agencies or to health care providers that she was raped. This could lead to potentially inaccurate, bureaucratic assessments of the private and traumatic details of a sexual assault.
Whether or not a woman qualifies for an abortion stands as a subjective matter. The decision could easily fall into the hands of the wrong policy makers, such as those who question whether an incident of sexual assault was “legitimate rape,” in the words of former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin, or whether the victim was “asking for it” by consuming alcohol and wearing “inappropriate” clothing. A 2010 “Wake Up To Rape” survey conducted by the Havens, a collection of London-based sexual assault clinics, found that one in 10 people thought a victim’s provocative dancing, flirting or clothing was to blame for a rape.
The arbiters might also unfairly take into account a woman’s past sexual history when deciding if a rape is “legitimate.” In 2006, Bill Napoli, then a Republican state senator in South Dakota, said that though most women got abortions for “convenience,” only a brutally raped young virgin who “planned on saving her virginity until she was married” actually deserved an abortion. In reality, whether or not a woman was a virgin or sexually active has nothing to do with a single incidence of rape.
With all this room for subjectivity, the Massachusetts GOP’s plan to limit abortion access to certain women is nothing but degrading and unfair. The U.S. policy on federal funding for abortions is already discriminatory enough: The Hyde Amendment of 1976 prohibits the use of federal money to terminate a pregnancy unless it resulted from rape or incest or if it threatens the mother’s life. California allows state funds to cover all abortions for low-income women, but many states still require rape victims to be able to prove they were raped to be eligible for an abortion covered by federal funds.
According to The Washington Post, 21 states require the woman to submit a doctor’s note verifying the rape. And 11 states require an official police report, although most rape cases go unreported, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. As a result, only 37 percent of low-income rape victims actually receive a federally funded abortion, and as many as 25 percent end up carrying the pregnancy to full term because they can’t afford the procedure, according to a 2009 review of 38 studies on the impact of Medicaid restrictions on abortion.
The Hyde Amendment is bad enough, but it only puts limits on federal funding for abortions and thus most directly affects only low-income women. But if the Massachusetts Republicans had their way, all American women would have to prove their rapes “legitimate” to even qualify for an abortion under the law.
A woman’s right to choose shouldn’t come down to whether or not she qualifies for a “rape exemption,” a decision that could be repressive and inconsistent if people such as Akin and Napoli are the judges. The Massachusetts GOP might appear to be picking up progressive stances by allowing abortion on some conditions, but the abortion debate should not be framed conditionally. Pro-choice isn’t about securing abortion access for certain women; it’s about believing in and supporting a woman’s autonomy over her own body. If a woman wants to terminate her pregnancy, that choice should be hers.
 
Adrienne Visani is a freshman majoring in neuroscience.
Until every single unwanted child at DHS is adopted, all the hypocrits need to get their big hypocritical noses out of the women’s reproductive issues. St. Paul’s Cathedral is full of baby bones from the priests raping and having relationships with the nuns that were smothered to death when born. So the Catholic church who is promoting all this harrassment of women and their reproductive choices are nothing but a bunch if perverted hypocrits.
Permitting abortions in the case of rape or incest knocks the legs from under the argument that an unborn fetus is an “innocent human life”.
That’s a problem for prolife groups. The majority of those in the pro life movement also agree that rape and incest should be exceptions to the rule.  That fundamentally conflicts with their main argument: That a fetus is an innocent human being and aborting the fetus is murder.
Isn’t it ironic that the same people who support the view that aborting the fetus is murder also support capital punishment?
Evidently they don’t see the contradiction.
I don’t have strong feelings about either abortion or capital punishment since my political views are not determined by emotion, however I have to disagree with your claim that pro-life views contradict pro-capital punishment views.
Pro-life is about protecting innocent human life.  Capital punishment is about ending guilty human life with the hope that it deters future crime, thereby protecting innocent human life.
In short, it’s the view that innocent humans deserve to live, and guilty ones deserve to die.  There is no contradiction there.
It would be a contradiction if someone claimed to be pro-life on the basis of protecting any human life, yet also supported capital punishment.  But you’ll notice that pro-lifers always qualify their argument by saying they wish to protect “innocent human life.”  Innocence is key.
OK. By that logic Texas, China and Saudi Arabia are the most moralistic governments on the planet. Statistics are not available for North Korea.
I suppose you’re free to draw whatever ridiculous conclusions you wish from my straightforward disproval of your emotion-driven thesis.
I am pro-life and I am against exceptions for rape and incest. I am also opposed to capital punishment. This is one of the things that I love about my Catholic faith- we have a consistent ethic of life. I totally get what Brad and North University Park are saying. As a philosophy major, I understand that when you have inconsistencies in your argument the whole thing falls apart. It especially frustrates me when my fellow pro-lifers have exceptions for rape and incest. I think most of the time it is a political move, for fear of appearing too radical (especially for politicians).  
Science, not my faith, tells me that the unborn are human. It is chilling when individuals and governments start deciding which humans are “persons” with rights and which are not. Historically, it has resulted in slavery and the Holocaust. I pray that we will see the end of abortion and capital punishment in our lifetimes.
I am a born again Christian and I believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is wrong.  Having said that, we can not legislate morality.  Abortion needs to be legal so that women are not harmed if they make this choice.  The problem is not whether it is legal or not.  The problem is that people do not think that these are babies.  I know that most Christians to not agree with me, but we can only begin to have a discussion when the other side is not backed into a corner, fighting for something that they want.  Give women and unrestricted right to choose and then let’s talk about what really happens after there is no threat.

USC senior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee were named to the Walter Camp Foundation’s 15-player “Watch List” for the Walter Camp Award, which is given to college football’s Player of the Year.
Barkley and Lee are two of four Pac-12 players on the list, the most for any conference, along with Oregon running back Kenjon Barner and UCLA running back Johnathan Franklin. Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel is the only freshman on the list. Georgia’s Jarvis Jones and Notre Dame’s Manti Te’o are the only defenders.
USC players have received the most Walter Camp Awards of all-time with six wins. O.J. Simpson won twice in 1967 and 1968, Charles White won in 1979, Marcus Allen in 1981, Matt Leinart in 2004 and Reggie Bush in 2005. The most recent winner was Stanford’s Andrew Luck.
The list will be cut to five finalists on November 28.
Barkley has thrown for 2,972 yards and 33 touchdowns, which make him second in touchdowns in the  NCAA. Lee has 98 receptions for 1,447 yards and 13 touchdowns, leading the NCAA in receptions and yards and is third in touchdowns. Recently, Lee has established himself as a Heisman candidate with Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein, Oregon’s Barner, Texas A&M’s Manziel and Notre Dame’s Te’o. All of the previously listed players are also eligible for the Walter Camp Award.

The USC women’s basketball team bounced back from a slow start against Gonzaga last week, beating Pepperdine 65-56 at the Galen Center on Sunday.
The Women of Troy (1-1) were led by Cassie Harberts (24 points, 10-13 FT, 10 rebounds, 2 blocks) and Ariya Crook (17 points, 3 assists). Harberts earned her second double-double in as many games.
“It was a well played game,” said USC coach Michael Cooper, “I liked our energy. That was the big key for us. We did an excellent job in shutting this team down in their three-point attempts.”
Robbie Mayberry led the Waves (1-2) with 12 points, 5 rebounds and 3 steals, while Shey Cooney-Williams finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds.
USC led 27-24 at the half while working around some mistakes. The Women of Troy shot 10-24 (41.7 percent) from the field, but committed 15 turnovers and 10 fouls, while Pepperdine committed 10 turnovers and 11 fouls. The Women of Troy would finish with 24 turnovers and 19 fouls, while out-rebounding Pepperdine 44-29.
“They did much better. They got their first game out of the way as a freshman,” said Harberts about the USC newcomers. “They played a great team. They came out and did a lot better job tonight. They still got 24 turnovers but that was myself included so you can’t put it all on the young players.”
The Women of Troy will face Arkansas State on Wednesday at 7 p.m. PT and Nebraska on Friday at 2 p.m., with both games at the Galen Center. Friday’s game will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.
