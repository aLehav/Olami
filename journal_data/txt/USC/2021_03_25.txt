What does the music industry look like when imbued with the Trojan spirit? According to The FAM founder Aaron Raus, it is a non-hierarchical field where compassion and collaboration triumph. The FAM is working toward making that a reality. What started as a project in a USC entrepreneurial class has become a non-profit — largely led by USC alumni.
Disturbed by the competition plaguing the music industry, Raus, then a sophomore at USC majoring in business administration, designed the club as a subscription-based organization. His goal of creating a more collaborative environment was largely inspired by the Trojan Family. 
“In the Trojan Family, we may have no connection; we could be 25 years apart, studied completely different things,” Raus said. “But because you’re a part of the Trojan Family, I want to see you be successful.”
After its launch during Raus’ sophomore year, The FAM, which is short for FAMily, became a USC campus organization, shedding its entrepreneurial elements. Their membership is now at a couple hundred students on campus, according to Karyn Ben-Gal, a senior majoring in music industry and The FAM’s director of membership.
Despite The FAM’s diverse offerings — ranging from workshops to social events — the organization’s leadership under Raus and USC Chapter President Kyu Hun Han, said its panel series is the most valuable program they offer to the USC community. For Han, a senior majoring in music industry, The FAM’s panel series gave him the confidence to take risks as he prepares to begin his career in the industry.
 “We brought on a hip hop artist named Call Me Ace,” Han said. “He talked about his unique experience in the industry, and how he’s balancing his corporate life with his creative work. As someone that wants to personally take that route, it was super cool to see how he was balancing everything.”
The FAM’s name was not just a stylistic choice. Maintaining a family-oriented nature, even amongst strangers, is central to the club’s mission according to Raus. Ben-Gal, who transferred as a junior, credits The FAM for making her transition much easier. She said that the organization provided her with an avenue to make friends when she was initially placed in classes largely dominated by freshmen.
“Everyone already had their friend groups. I was looking at other ways to get involved and meet people within my major,” Ben-Gal said. “I heard of The FAM, and I was like, ‘This is a great way for me to get involved and meet people who have the same goals and aspirations as me.’”
Like many clubs on campus, The FAM maintains club activities remotely. The organization, heavily dedicated to promoting networking and facilitating connections, naturally faces difficulty as they’re forced onto Zoom according to Han.
“I feel like the industry does thrive, and music in itself thrives on the one-on-one conversations you can have in-person, and that face-to-face is super important to me,” Han said.
There is a bright side to the remote conversations forced by the coronavirus pandemic, however. After moving events onto Zoom, Raus noticed an uptick in the number of attendees who lived outside the country.
“We’ve had people from Australia and people from Mexico come to our events,” Raus said. “That tells me that we should be continuing to host virtual events — maybe not nearly as often — but providing opportunities for people that don’t have the luxury of a music community wherever they are.”
After reaching outside the country, The FAM is setting its sights on even more difficult to reach territory — UCLA. Not only does it seem intuitive to expand their potential network by reaching out to a long-known rival, UCLA’s location and overlap is perfect, according to Raus, as The FAM eases into creating a new chapter there.
“Our goal is to start our second chapter this fall,” Raus said. “Our network is in Los Angeles, and they have a great music program.”
As an outsider to other universities, Raus recognized he had to acquire some sort of credibility to garner support for The FAM on other campuses. His solution was to morph The FAM into a non-profit, something radically different from the project he created as a sophomore at the Marshall School of Business. After a nine-month-long process, the organization acquired 501(c)(3) status — what is known as a charitable organization.
“We’re able to have that credibility and take that to NYU, or Belmont or Miami,” Raus said. “I think just being a club doesn’t give you that same credibility.”
Raus shared that there was also a financial motivator for his eagerness to acquire 501(c)(3) status. As a non-profit, The FAM has a wider array of sources to fund donations. Now, they work toward receiving funding from patrons who are not exclusive to the USC community.
“We have tax-deductible donations, which means we can now connect with anyone who’s interested in supporting the arts,” Raus said. 
The FAM’s efforts provide another safety net for USC students in warranted crises as they struggle with pre-professional aspirations. Its transition from a Marshall entrepreneurship class assignment to a club that caters to hundreds on campus reflects The FAM’s growth as it attempts to maintain community-centered values according to Raus. These values would be The FAM’s differentiator from any other networking club on campus.
As the organization enters a new era as a non-profit, students across the country are being exposed to something that Raus believes the Trojan Family figured out a long time ago — a commitment to fostering community over competition that makes the pre-professional arena easier on everyone involved. Still, in Ben-Gal’s experience, The FAM’s greatest value lies in its family-oriented quality that ensures that, even while networking, one can still find a friend.
“[The FAM] has taught me the importance of being kind of a family and a bigger sister to others,” Ben-Gal said. “Being someone that others can lean on and use as a resource, rather than being like ‘this is my spot and you can’t take any of it.’”

When Ashley Fulton was just seven years old, she developed a strong musical foundation that would serve her for years to come. Fulton started her music journey learning classical piano, but by age 11, she picked up music production after discovering GarageBand. By age 13, she was using Logic Pro, a digital audio software she continues to use to this day.
Since then, her love for music has only grown stronger. And now she is on her way to pursuing her childhood dream of being a professional musician as a sophomore at USC Thorton School of Music majoring in music production.
Her parents were very supportive of her musical ambitions throughout her childhood, and Fulton attributes a lot of her success to this support. She also got involved in theatre early in life, allowing her to develop her voice. 
During high school, Fulton had mentors in songwriting, piano and voice, performed in venues in multiple states and went to many programs and workshops related to songwriting and voice. 
She spent high school as involved in music as possible, and knew that it was something she wanted to pursue in college. She only applied to two schools, both far from her hometown of Cleveland: The University of Southern California and Berklee College of Music in Boston. 
Now, the 19-year-old has already won many awards and scholarships, including a gold medal for the national NAACP Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics, the Delta Sigma Theta Jabberwock Scholarship talent competition, the Great American Songwriting Contest, the Shining Star CLE singing competition and many more. 
At one such competition in 2018, the 5-week summer music performance program at Berklee College of Music, she met Paige Thibault, a musician who would also go on to attend USC. The two were roommates their freshman year, and in early 2020, Fulton opened for Thibault at a concert at Genghis Cohen on Fairfax Ave. Thibault, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, enjoyed working with Fulton. 
“[It] was really special to see her get up on the stage and command the space in the room. And her set was like, so cool, my jaw was dropped to the floor the whole time,” Thibault said. 
Fulton is skilled in many genres such as rock, pop, trap, hip hop, jazz and something she describes as “sci-fi, ethereal, like gamer music.” 
“Stylistically, I’m kind of all over the place, but I definitely don’t see that as a bad thing … just because there’s so much, across the world and across the boundaries of time, to appreciate and to get inspired from,” Fulton said. 
But Fulton has always particularly looked up to 15-time Grammy Award winning singer-songwriter Alicia Keys. Fondly remembering listening to “Songs In A Minor” in the car when she was a kid, she said that she engages the idiom similarly to Keys in her own writing. Fulton has both perfect pitch and synesthesia, which has allowed her to get more into microtonality recently. 
She describes microtonality as “expanding the range of notes that you’re able to fit into an octave”, and personally, because of her synesthesia, “[expanding] the amount of colors, I mean that quite literally, like colors on your palate, that you’re able to use.” 
As a woman in music production, she deeply values the perspective she brings to the space, saying “I feel like my lived experience as a woman in this space does actually tend to color the way in which I approach music and the music that I do end up creating.” 
She wants to encourage that diversity in any way she can, using the opportunities she has gotten at USC.
“[I want to] use all the resources that I’ve been given to open the space and to encourage more women, more girls, more non-binary folks to really, really get into the industry and into music production specifically,” Fulton said. “Because I think with this specific craft, there’s just so much artistic integrity and creative freedom that comes with it.”
Over her last three semesters at USC, a lot of Fulton’s time has been spent writing for other musicians, but she hopes to step into the artist role in the next few years. She likes working with other creators though, saying that working with other people is the most interesting part about making music. 
One of her favorite recent collaborations was with another Thorton student, Hannah Abrahim. Abrahim, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance with an emphasis in voice, was working on a group project with Fulton, which, according to Fulton, initially started out small, and eventually became a fully produced pop song. Abrahim credits their good chemistry. 
“Ashley is just a beast. Like, she brings so much to the table. She’s so knowledgeable,” Abrahim said. “She’s so talented … she literally does it all. She plays every instrument, she’s incredible at the keys, she produces really well.” 
Fulton and Abrahim’s collaboration had to be completely virtual during the pandemic, which is common for young musicians right now. According to Fulton, it’s doable, but there are a lot more things that can disrupt the creative process. Some artists like it, others can’t stand it. 
Fulton’s process hasn’t changed too much. She said that “[the pandemic] is coinciding at a time when DIY music is also really, really starting to become the norm within the industry.” 
Fulton looks forward to having free time this summer to work on music more, saying “it’s just a chance to reground myself creatively and to just step into a new space.” She is currently in the process of finishing her next album.

USC will pay $852 million to more than 700 patients of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall after reaching a settlement Thursday, making it the largest sexual abuse settlement in history against any university. The development follows a $215 million class action lawsuit approved in February 2020 that allowed the University to provide payouts ranging from $2,500 to $250,000 to former patients who chose to come forward.
“Our abuse has been recognized at a higher level,” said Daniella Mohazab, a patient of Tyndall’s from 2016, who spoke at a press conference hosted by attorney Gloria Allred Thursday. “We are seen. We’ve been heard. Now, we can continue to heal, focus on ourselves.”
The majority of the 710 women will receive an average of $1.2 million from the settlement, attorney John Manly, who represents 234 of the individuals, said at a press conference he hosted Thursday. A retired judge, who specializes in redistribution, will allocate the funds.
“I’m sure when you arrived at USC … and you go to orientation, they talk about how you’re a member of the Trojan family,” Manly told the Daily Trojan. “If these women that I represent … are part of the Trojan family, they’re our daughters, our sisters and our moms, right? We don’t treat family that way.”
Former patients of Tyndall largely began stepping forward in May 2018, following a Los Angeles Times investigation that exposed Tyndall’s history of sexual misconduct over his nearly 30-year tenure that was kept under wraps by a quiet firing in 2016 following an internal investigation. 
“While I don’t feel there’s a way to really put monetary value on the pain and suffering endured from being physically abused, and then silently and even subconsciously living out the consequences of the abuse for over 20 years, this day is a starting place for me,” Kathryn, a former patient of Tyndall’s victims whose last name was omitted, said at the press conference hosted by Allred Thursday. 
Despite the developments within the settlements, Tyndall’s attorney Leonard Levine said Tyndall remains adamant of his innocence. 
“Dr. Tyndall continues to maintain that he is innocent of all criminal charges in this case and he looks forward to a jury trial when the charges will be tested for the first time in a court of law,” Levine said.
The Board of Trustees hired law firm O’Melveny & Myers to conduct an independent investigation into Tyndall’s misconduct in May 2018, following Rick Caruso’s election as chairman that same month. Caruso initially said he would release the results of the investigation following litigation; however, at a student briefing Thursday Caruso said there are no plans to release the report now that the settlement has been finalized, saying that it would only cause more pain to former patients of Tyndall. 
“There’s no upside to any release,” Caruso said during a student media briefing Thursday. “There was not a formal report that was created. There was a presentation that special counsel gave to the executive committee and the board. At this point, given where this case is at, we feel strongly that having anything released, is only going to cause more pain and suffering to the victim. And it’s in the best interest of the victims to just let this get settled and move forward.”
Manly called out Caruso’s decision to withhold the results of the investigation during his press conference, requesting that USC be transparent for the benefit of the public.
Since the investigation, USC has expanded safety protocols to include a rewritten sensitive exam policy in accordance with the American College Health Association’s best practices, employing more women board-certified physicians, increased accessibility to reporting potential misconduct and patient feedback and the expansion of the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention program. 
The University has also established a Division of Human Resources, Equity, and Compliance, a centralized Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX, a Universitywide Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation policy for students, staff and faculty as well as extended support for mandatory training and 24/7 victim advocacy services. 
“As we work to restore trust and rebuild our community, our guiding principle must always be to
foster an environment where all students, faculty, and staff feel welcome and safe,” Caruso wrote in a letter to the University community. “While we have much work to do, I am proud of the progress we have made since the difficult summer of 2018 and have great optimism for the future of our university.”
USC will fund the settlement over the next two fiscal years by drawing from litigation reserves and insurance proceeds, deferring capital spending and managing non-essential expenses and assets, according to a letter from President Carol Folt to the University community. None of the funds will come from philanthropic gifts, endowment funds or tuition, she wrote. The University will also put together an advisory committee comprising faculty, staff and students, which will aid school deans and the Academic Senate on Finance and Enrollment in providing input on the budget.
“The amount is significant, and we will face some difficult financial choices in the near term.
However, we have a strong balance sheet and resources to support our academic priorities,” Folt wrote.
Manly said although there’s work to be done to “restore the University,” he said he’s hopeful that the culture at USC will change under Folt’s leadership.
“I’m very hopeful that President Folt is going to change the culture, and the culture needs to change,” Manly said. “But if it doesn’t, you’re going to have hundreds of women who are going to watch and wait and see what happens … They’re going to hold her accountable.”
Ana Mata and Kacie Yamamoto contributed to this report. 
This article was updated at 7:30 p.m. to include quotes from press conferences held by law firms and survivors after the announcement of the settlement.

Fandoms scare me… even though I’m part of a few. Most people find themselves part of one whether it be Disney or Star Wars, though what these fan bases have in common is what makes me really uneasy. It isn’t their die-hard supporters, it’s how the casting of Black actors in roles originally written as white (or some fans imagined as white) causes uproar amongst fans. 
For some reason, just about every time I’ve seen a Black actor in a traditionally white role, the internet goes crazy — and not in a good way, at all. 
Back in 2019, singer and actress, Halle Bailey, was cast as Princess Ariel from the classic Disney film, “The Little Mermaid.” While many fans were excited that a Black woman would be diversifying the role — as well as bringing a killer singing voice — other fans weren’t too happy with the decision. Some fans even went as far as using the hashtag #NotMyAriel, to explain that the character should be white and ginger, not Black. 
After the backlash circulated all over the internet, Bailey responded to it, in an interview with Variety, explaining that getting the role is worth more than paying attention to the hate.
“I’m just grateful,” Bailey said. “I don’t pay attention to the negativity. I just feel like this role is something bigger than me.”
Freeform, a cable channel owned by Disney, ended up releasing a statement reminding “Poor, Unfortunate Souls” that Ariel was in fact Danish, Danish people — and mer-folk alike — can be Black, and that the Little Mermaid is fictional. 
This isn’t the only case where fans were outraged by the casting of a Black person in a well-loved franchise. This was also true for Finn (John Boyega) in the recent Star Wars films, who before “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” didn’t exist, so there was no racial basis for the character. When the teaser trailer for the film first released in 2014, one of the first glimpses is Boyega as the first Black stormtrooper. 
Much like Bailey though, some fans were excited, and others became Twitter trolls who called for the film to be boycotted because of Boyega’s inclusion. In an interview with GQ, five years after the film was released, Boyega described the adverse responses he received and how different they were from his white counterparts.
“Nobody else in the cast had people saying they were going to boycott the movie because [they were in it],” Boyega said. “Nobody else had the uproar and death threats sent to their Instagram DMs and social media, saying, ‘Black this and Black that and you shouldn’t be a Stormtrooper.’”
These two specific instances are among an entirely too long list of negative, and frankly racist, responses to casting choices. This has happened when Zazie Beetz was cast as Domino in “Deadpool 2,” when Anna Diop became Starfire in “Titans,” when Zendaya was M.J. in “Spiderman: Homecoming,” when Amandla Stenberg was Rue in “The Hunger Games” and when Idris Elba was Heimdall in “Thor,” I could go on forever.
The toxicity of fandoms isn’t that surprising though, because these tend to be characters and franchises that white audiences looked up to. But what some don’t realize is that because Black people usually didn’t appear in these spaces, apart from the occasional one character like Princess Tiana or Lando Calrissian, much of the Black community looked up to the white characters too. 
It’s said best in this study, conducted by Mel Stanfill, on whiteness and fan studies that, “The whiteness of fandom leads to fans refusing to address race as well as actively foregrounding whiteness,” showing that at times diversity is overlooked by white fans until casting decisions spark unnecessary controversy. 
Fandoms are meant to be a community for people who share the same love for these franchises, not a space for anti-Blackness. Rather than being harshly criticized and bullied over social media, Black actors should be celebrated when cast as a character in a fandom that has usually left them out. So to the previously outraged fans out there (who still have the originals to enjoy, by the way), appreciate the newly-found variety in casting and, please, think before you tweet.

Lakers fans held their breath Saturday as superstar LeBron James laid on the hardwood clutching his lower leg. As James headed for the locker room, those watching had flashbacks to Christmas 2018 when the four-time MVP suffered a groin injury that derailed the Lakers’ ambitious playoff hopes. 
Seeing James go down with a high right ankle sprain at this point in the Lakers’ season feels eerily similar to the injury that sparked the team’s disappointing collapse just three years ago. The veteran is out indefinitely, but can he return in time to save the Lakers’ season? 
James has been one of history’s most durable star athletes throughout his 18 years in the league. His 2018 injury was the first to cost James significant playing time in his long career, spanning over 1,300 regular season games, plus 260 in the postseason. 
James’ first season in Los Angeles looked promising before his injury, after which the Lakers quickly started sliding in their leader’s absence. Other injuries and a lack of chemistry following James’ return kept them out of the 2019 playoffs. 
While I don’t expect the Lakers to miss the playoffs again, it looks like a long road to a potential repeat as NBA champions and similar issues might hinder them going forward. James’ co-star Anthony Davis has played just 23 games and there is no clear timetable for his return from a calf injury. 
Other Lakers have missed games for various reasons, including center Marc Gasol who has not played since the All-Star break due to coronavirus safety protocols. Given these setbacks, the Lakers just do not look as dominant as they did last season, when they held onto the best record in the West for much of the season. 
At full strength, the Lakers are certainly title contenders and should be the favorites to come out of the West after breezing through the conference to the 2020 championship. 
The question is whether they will be able to return to form in time for the playoffs, and how much damage will already be done by the time James and Davis return. 
The Lakers are currently third in the West, but you can expect them to drop several spots in the coming weeks. They’ve lost their last three games, including Saturday’s against the Hawks where James went down. 
The Lakers rebuilt their supporting cast in the offseason, but the reality is they do not have the depth to string together wins in the Western Conference without their two stars. 
Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schrӧder and Montrezl Harrell are their best players, at least on the offensive end of the floor, and none of them were starters on an NBA team last year. They excel within their roles, but three overqualified sixth men and a strange assortment of players designed to fit with James’ unique offensive game are not going to keep the Lakers in third place for long. 
Furthermore, Davis and James bear quite a burden on the defensive end as well, and the Lakers’ league-best defensive rating of 106.7 is sure to decline as well without them.
We don’t know when the two superstars will be returning, but the longer they remain sidelined, the more difficult a championship run becomes for the Lakers. The end of the regular season is less than eight weeks away, and it’s possible James could be out for that amount of time. 
Best-case scenario, the Lakers still have a playoff spot when James and Davis return. But even if that happens with several weeks left, they will be fighting for a higher seed and home court advantage to close out the season. 
I wouldn’t expect them to be playing in championship form during the last couple of weeks of the season either. Last year, the Los Angeles Clippers were a great example of a talented team that collapsed due to a lack of chemistry. They simply didn’t play enough games with all of their pieces together. 
While it is critical the Lakers play as many games with James and Davis as possible, it is also paramount they do not rush their two stars back onto the court. James’ history makes him seem indestructible, and I wouldn’t be too surprised to see him back at full strength in just a few short weeks. However, he is 36 years old, and there are a lot of miles on that right ankle. 
Davis’ calf strain feels quite similar to the calf injury Kevin Durant rushed back from in the 2019 playoffs that resulted in him rupturing his Achilles tendon and remaining sidelined for 18 months. Hopefully, the Lakers will give their star sufficient time to recover; his long-term health and availability in May and June are more important than the last weeks of the regular season. 
Regardless of when the Lakers return to full strength, they have their work cut out for them. The defending champions are decimated and look like anything but contenders without their stars. They’ll have to pick up the pieces quickly come playoff time and lean heavily on the leadership of James and Davis in order to make a deep run. It’s not looking good right now.

After the No. 11 USC men’s tennis team’s  5-2 win in San Diego against the Toreros, the Trojans returned home to sweep the Stanford Cardinal 7-0 Tuesday. 
USC is picking up the pace during the start of their Pac-12 conference campaign. The currently undefeated pair of sophomore Stefan Dostanic and junior Bradley Frye quickly beat junior Alexandre Rotsaert and freshman Arthur Fery in a 6-1 win. Then, the No. 1 doubles team in the nation, USC senior Daniel Cukierman and redshirt senior Riley Smith pulled out an impressive 6-2 win against freshman Tristan Boyer and senior Axel Geller. 
The win secured the doubles point for the Trojans as the match was suspended between the pair of junior Jake Sands and freshman Lodewijk Weststrate against Stanford’s sophomore Neel Rajesh and senior Timothy Sah.
Head coach Brett Masi attributes his team’s doubles success primarily to Dostanic and Frye’s authority on the courts as a pair.
“Bradley Frye and Stefan Dostanic, they are kind of leading the charge right now with how well they are playing for one [another] and just their energy and their level,” Masi said. “From the word go, they are just being very solid, they are doing the right things.” 
During the singles matchups the Trojans once again swept the Cardinal. 
Last week’s Pac-12 men’s tennis player of the week Bradley Frye was able to beat No. 119 Boyer easily in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. However, that was the only dominant win of USC’s singles matches, with most of the other matches going down to the wire. One of the most clutch performances of the afternoon was No. 19 Smith upsetting No. 3 Rotsaert in a crucial tiebreaker after tightly losing the second set, 6-3, 6-7(5), 1-0 (12-10). 
Coach Masi emphasized Smith’s perseverance and resilience in his win against one of the top singles players in the country.
“Luckily, Riley [Smith] was able to finish that match out,” Masi said. “I know just for himself, he really wanted that win. That guy [Rotsaert] has been a top 10 player in college tennis, so for[Smith] that’s awesome.”
Similarly No. 104 Dostanic pulled off his own upset when he beat No. 94 Fery in a closely-contested second set, 6-1, 7-5. No. 1 singles player in the nation Cuckierman was also in a tough matchup against No. 20 Geller where he barely won the first set 7-5, but Geller retired in the second set while Cuckierman was up 2-0. In the fifth position, Weststrate was able to get away with the win despite the fierce challenge of Sah in the second set, 6-2, 1-6, 6-1. Finally, the visit from the Cardinal ended at court six, where Sands had a close match against fifth-year William Genesen. Sands prevailed in two back-to-back hard-fought sets, 7-5, 7-5. 
Despite the close matchups in singles, coach Masi applauded the entire team’s mentality while facing the Cardinal.
“I think the biggest thing was to keep our mental focus to finish[Stanford] off and win the match 7-0,” said Masi about the team’s mindset during Tuesday’s matchup. “[It] makes a statement that we are ready to get going and play the right tennis.”As they continue through Pac-12 conference play, the Trojans are planning on finishing the finals months of the season on a high note. USC now heads down to the state of Arizona this weekend to face conference rivals No. 15 Arizona in Tucson on Friday, March 26, and then No. 19 Arizona State in Tempe on Sunday, March 28.

USC Baseball lost to San Diego 6-5 at Dedeaux Field Tuesday night. 
The loss ended the Trojans’ six-game winning streak. Prior to snapping the streak, USC had swept their previous two series 3-0 against Nevada and Washington. 
“We just played a really good team and it was a really good game. Obviously they just kind of had the edge today,” said redshirt junior infielder Jamal O’Guinn. 
USC was in the midst of gaining some much needed momentum after a slow start to this season.
“I think early on in the season we just weren’t playing very good baseball,” O’Guinn said. “We definitely weren’t playing as good as we should, but where we are now, we’re playing really good baseball obviously coming off six wins in a row.” 
The Trojans now stand with a 9-7 season record. The Toreros’ record improved to 12-4. The last time the two teams met was in 2017 when San Diego defeated USC 8-3. 
In Tuesday’s game, the Trojans took an early lead with an RBI single from redshirt senior infielder John Thomas in the first inning. The second and third innings were slow with no runs scored from either team. Redshirt senior infielder Tyler Pritchard scored an RBI single in the fourth inning to bring USC to a 2-0 lead. 
The Trojans’ offense struggled later, leaving multiple runners on base and missing opportunities to score. 
“There’s always stuff to work on,” O’Guinn said. “But tonight we had a few mistakes in certain situations like runners in scoring position, just little things, so we will definitely learn from that.”
Redshirt pitcher Brian Gursky led the Trojans defense allowing no runs in the fourth inning and only one in the fifth from San Diego graduate student midfielder Paul Kunst. 
The Trojans responded with a RBI single from redshirt junior infielder Ben Ramirez and an RBI double from freshman catcher Garret Guillemette to increase USC’s lead to 5-1. 
San Diego started to cut their deficit in the sixth with an RBI double from graduate student infielder Thomas Luevano. USC’s defense struggled, allowing the Toreros to add another run in the seventh. 
With no advances by either team in the eighth, USC was still leading 5-4 going into the ninth with freshman pitcher Charlie Hurley on the mound. San Diego junior catcher Shane McGuire hit a low ball down the line past Thomas for a go ahead run, tying up the game. 
With McGuire on third, San Diego secured the win with an RBI from utility freshman Jack Costello. The ball was hit at freshman infielder Nate Clow and jumped up to his neck causing him to drop the ball. 
Despite the loss, the Trojans are still confident in the progress they have made and the momentum they have been creating over the past few weeks. 
“During the course of those six games, we realized how good we could be,” O’Guinn said. “I definitely think that this loss won’t affect us, and I think we will come out pretty good and strong against UCLA on Friday.”
USC is undefeated in the Pac-12 after sweeping Washington last week 3-0. The Trojans continue conference play this weekend with a home series against No. 10 UCLA. First pitch is 7 p.m. Friday at Dedeaux Field.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and abuse.
When a woman is in a violent situation, especially one in which she fears for her life, she should be able to defend herself without criminalization. 
Unfortunately, this wasn’t the case for Cyntoia Brown, Keiana Aldrich and Chrystul Kizer, who were convicted for defending themselves while being sex trafficked; and Nan Hui-Jo, Bresha Meadows, Charisse Shumate and Marissa Alexander, who were incarcerated for defending themselves against domestic violence. These are some names among the many more other women who were convicted over the years for trying to survive a violent set of circumstances.
According to the American Civil Liberties Union, women are the fastest growing incarcerated population in the United States, and this population has been increasing at twice the rate of male incarceration over the last three decades. Additionally, the ACLU reported that 92% of all women in California prisons have been abused in their lifetimes.
The World Health Organization announced that one in three women globally experience physical or sexual violence during their lifetime. Severe and life-threatening violence against women is increasingly prevalent in our society, and when  40-80% of women convicted of murder acted in self-defense against their abusers, society should start to reflect on the way that victims of abuse or violence are being criminalized for surviving.
Survivors of sex trafficking and domestic abuse may face unstable and dangerous living situations after being coerced or groomed into criminal activity or facing violence, and many face the challenges of having to protect their children’s lives and defend themselves against life-threatening situations. 
Marissa Alexander endured three years of incarceration and two years in house arrest for firing a warning shot to defend her life from her abusive husband, who had threatened to kill her in 2012, nine days after giving birth to her premature daughter. Although Alexander’s husband had been arrested twice for domestic violence, hospitalized her and admitted his role as an aggressor, Alexander was sentenced to twenty years in prison. Even though she did not have a previous criminal record and had not harmed anybody, Alexander was not given protection under the “Stand Your Ground” self-defense law. Alexander was freed in 2017 after launching a campaign to educate communities on the intersections of domestic violence and criminalization and has since become an activist against the criminalization of women.
It was a similar grassroots organizing effort which freed Alexander that also attracted enough attention to pay Chrystul Kizer’s $400,000 bail after she spent two years in jail awaiting trial for defending herself against a man twice her age who had sexually abused her. Kizer, who was 17 years old when she was arrested, says that Randall Volar had pinned her on the floor after she rejected sex from him, and she shot him in self defense. Before Kizer had acted in defense of herself, Volar had been under investigation for child pornography and sex trafficking. 
An important factor in winning Alexander and Kizer’s freedom was community awareness and engagement, which is the most effective aspect in reforming any system. The Free Marissa Now Mobilization Campaign was an activist-run platform that engaged in community outreach, organized resources, published educational materials and produced opportunities for action. They worked in collaboration with Alexander and her mother until she was freed five years later. Additionally, the Chrystul Kizer Defense Committee played a large role in spreading awareness and promoting community advocacy in order to raise the funds needed to bail Kizer out of jail; they are still encouraging fundraising efforts in order to help Chrystul pay living and transportation costs. 
When criminal justice and court officials choose to criminalize a woman defending herself, a miscarriage of justice occurs. Women who have survived violence deserve to be met with resources, not handcuffs.
For some women, being sent to prison for surviving can end up being a death sentence in itself. The California Coalition for Women Prisoners, a grassroots social justice organization, was founded in 1995 to join the fight for better prison healthcare after Clarisse Shumate and other incarcerated women filed Shumate v. Wilson, a case against the medical neglect  of incarcerated women. Shumate had been given a life sentence for defending herself against her abusive boyfriend, yet she only served 16 years after her body slowly deteriorated from sickle cell anemia, cancer and hepatitis C, and was not given proper medical treatment or attention. After she died in 2001, CCWP continues to advocate for social justice and the abolition of the prison industrial complex.
The criminalization of the survival of women who have experienced violence comes at a very high and human cost. It is very immoral and unethical to cast victims of violence out of society and add to their trauma. Many women wrongfully spend years of their life incarcerated after being convicted by the same officials who were supposed to protect them and give them justice. There is a need for reckoning to increase transparency and accountability in the criminal justice system. 
As a community, we do not need a uniform or badge to make a difference — we can conduct grassroots campaigns to promote fundraisers, awareness, protests and collective action, just as volunteer groups have done to help Alexander, Kizer and many others win their freedom. Groups such as CCWP are informative and accessible ways to stay engaged in advocating for social justice and incarcerated women. At USC, the Human Trafficking Awareness Club’s mission is to promote community awareness of human trafficking and related issues in Los Angeles and the surrounding area. By engaging ourselves and others, we can all do our part to protect the rights of women and end criminalization of survival in violent situations.

The United States Senate is “the only legislative body in the world which requires a supermajority for ordinary business.” But it was never meant to be. The framers of the U.S. Constitution intended for supermajorities to be used for only four types of votes: convicting impeached officials, overriding presidential vetoes, ratifying treaties and enacting constitutional amendments. The framers’ reasoning was that these four types of votes were highly consequential and therefore could not be left to the whims of a simple majority. Although they could have chosen to extend the supermajority case to other votes, they chose not to do so.
In the U.S. Senate, the smallest simple majority can be obtained with the votes of 50 senators, plus the tie-breaking vote of the vice president. Such is the case for Democrats in the current Senate, which is split 50/50 and is presided over by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. In any other democracy in the world, a simple majority would suffice for most if not all of a presidential platform to be passed into law. But not in the U.S.
This is because in 1806, the Senate eliminated a procedural rule that automatically cut off floor debate. This resulted from a recommendation Aaron Burr (who is perhaps most remembered for killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel) gave the Senate in 1805. Burr believed this procedural rule was redundant. In practice, however, dropping this rule made it so that any debate on any issue could be extended indefinitely.
A filibuster occurs when a senator or group of senators “prolong” debate on a bill, resolution, amendment or another debatable issue. It is used by minority actors to delay or prevent said measure from coming to a vote. Before 1917, the Senate rules did not provide any means to curtail a filibuster. However, in that year, the Senate adopted “cloture,” a rule that forced an issue to come to a vote if two-thirds of the senators (67) voted for it to do so. In 1975, the number of votes required for cloture was reduced to three-fifths of the senators (60).
Although utilizing a filibuster for routine legislation is an oddity of American democracy, the conventional view of American political orthodoxy is that it is ultimately a good thing. The orthodox view is that the filibuster provides “a brake on hasty lawmaking that encourages bipartisanship,” and that its removal would lead to a “see-saw” of policymaking that would allow both parties to pass considerable legislation to further their agenda and undo the other side’s every two to four years. 
However, this orthodox view overlooks some key insights. 
In providing a “brake” that restricts the Senate’s ability to pass new laws, the filibuster effectively restricts the power of the legislative branch. The framers of the Constitution intended to create a system of checks and balances between three “co-equal” branches. If the legislative branch does not agree with the judicial interpretation of existing laws or the executive enforcement and execution of said laws, they could simply create new ones. This ability is largely curtailed if legislators have a limited ability to create new laws. 
Additionally, the idea that a filibuster “encourages” bipartisanship might be a fallacy in today’s highly politicized environment. While moderate Republicans and Democrats might be persuaded to vote for a bill from the other side, there are not enough of said moderate senators to reach the 60 vote threshold. Bills are more often centered around the core base of both parties, not their moderate legs. The supermajority required for bills to pass in the Senate therefore silences moderate voices more often than it gives them power. Only one bill in the past decade has passed with a bipartisan, filibuster proof majority in the Senate — an emergency coronavirus bill passed under the Trump administration. 
Not only might the removal of the filibuster give more power to senators who are willing to reach across the aisle, but it could also alter the composition of the Senate into a more moderate one and reduce the bi-polarity of the Washington political environment. The filibuster’s existence allows senators to campaign on highly polemic and divisive issues with full knowledge they will never be held accountable for voting on such matters given that the filibuster will never allow any such legislation to pass. 
Other democracies “tolerate” the “see-saw” effect of removing the filibuster. This includes many democracies ranked healthier than the U.S.’s democracy. The U.S.’ founding fathers did not intend for a filibuster to restrict the creation of new legislation. In the words of Hamilton, on giving power to the minority, “its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the… artifices of an insignificant…junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. … The public business must, in some way or another, go forward.”
American democracy finds itself at a stand still. In recent years, the filibuster has been wielded to prevent gun reform agreed upon by 54 senators. Its use is also currently threatening to prevent the passage of a measure that would impose federal voting standards, end partisan gerrymandering and ask presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns.
Scrapping the filibuster offers a potential way forward to not only make the U.S. a democracy that is more closely aligned with the visions of the founding fathers but also a healthier one.
