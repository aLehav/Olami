USC women’s volleyball head coach Mick Haley constantly emphasizes the importance of traveling well. It is no secret in the world of sport that success is hardest to achieve away from the friendly confines of home. The Women of Troy will be tested in that respect early and often this season, and if the team’s performance in last weekend’s season-opening tournament is any indication, those wins might not be so difficult to earn after all.

The opening tournament went swimmingly for the Women of Troy, who received stellar contributions from all parts of their lineup in a 3-0 sweep last weekend. After a 3-1 defeat of Purdue in the season’s first match, the club recorded back-to-back sweeps of Western Kentucky and Alabama A&M to win their first pre-conference tournament of the 2013 campaign.
USC will now hit the road for the second of three consecutive weekends, traveling to the Midwest to participate in the Marquette Challenge. The squad will open with a Friday doubleheader against TCU and Marquette, followed by a Saturday trip to DeKalb, Ill. to face off against Northern Illinois.
“I think we can be pretty good. We did some things that we’ve been practicing, which is encouraging because [that means] we’re doing a good job teaching,” Haley said. “I got to play a lot of players, and we had two very good matches against Western Kentucky and Purdue, both ranked teams.”
Fittingly, a highly touted member of USC’s latest youth movement paved the way in the opening match. Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu recorded a team-high 15 kills and eight blocks in a stellar debut performance.
“Since this was my first tournament, I really wanted to come out and make a statement,” Nwanebu said. “Everyone on the team has been supportive, so that has helped a lot with my confidence.”
Nwanebu teamed up with sophomore standout Samantha Bricio in the next match, as the two combined for 22 kills to pace USC’s attack. Haley’s decision to play his freshmen paid off, as outsider hitter Elise Ruddins notched eight kills on 14 swings and setter Alice Pizzasegola had 19 assists to complement junior Hayley Crone’s 20.
“I think Ebony performed very well, as did all of our freshmen, for their first tournament,” Haley said. “Ebony had a lot of responsibility and started playing well in the heat of the competition. She showed that she likes to compete and she brought some heat. I’d like to see her blocking and defense get better, but she’s good enough to be a six-rotation player, and that’s our goal for her.”
The Women of Troy concluded the tournament with a dominant performance against Alabama A&M, as Bricio received her third career tournament MVP nod and joined Nwanebu and senior libero and captain Natalie Hagglund on the all-tournament team. Haley rotated all three of his freshman liberos, as newcomers Anne Marie Schmidt and Kelly Wimmer saw their first taste of collegiate action.
“We still have some questions as to where we need to really spend our work,” Haley said. “We got some good blocking, but I don’t think we passed as well as we’re capable of, and we certainly made way too many service errors. We’re working on some things with the serving and trying to get the new kids comfortable.”
Junior outside hitter Emily Young, who saw action in the first and third matches, praised the team’s performance but also noted the importance of redirecting focus to the upcoming tournament.
“It was an excellent opening tournament for our team, and I think it was a great opportunity for us to test what we’ve been working on,” Young said. “But [Haley] is always looking toward the next game, so we can celebrate our win in the moment but we know we have worthy opponents to play.”

Welcome to Year One. Not the cheesy 2009 Jack Black caveman flick, but the first season of USC basketball with new head coach Andy Enfield at the helm.
Moving forward · After starting in the backcourt for two years, junior Byron Wesley will be relied upon as a leader this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Eight players do return from last season’s 14-18 squad, as well as a couple transfers, but gone are the squad’s senior point guard, most reliable scorer and best post defender. Jio Fontan and Eric Wise graduated, while Dewayne Dedmon declared for the NBA draft and went unselected before signing with the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.
Senior forwards Aaron Fuller, Renaldo Woolridge and 7-foot-1 center James Blasczyk are also gone, their eligibility used up.
This year, a new set of leaders has to step up for the program. The obvious choice would seem to be junior guard Byron Wesley, who has started all of his 64 games in two seasons at USC. Wesley has been consistent throughout two tumultuous years, and being the only scholarship player on the roster with two years of experience at USC, he’ll be relied upon to lead whether he likes it or not.
“I hope so,” Enfield said concerning Wesley becoming a leader. “When you’re a junior or senior, you need to step up and realize that your college career is going to end pretty soon, so what are you going to do about it?”
A duo of seniors in center Omar Oraby and guard J.T. Terrell also return after both transfers from former head coach Kevin O’Neill’s tenure had up-and-down seasons in their first year at Troy.
Enfield has recruited two transfers himself this offseason in junior guard Pe’Shon Howard (University of Maryland) and senior 7-foot center D.J. Haley (Virginia Commonwealth), who will be eligible to play immediately and are in contention to start. Even though both recorded underwhelming scoring numbers last year at their previous schools — Howard averaged 3.3 points in 22.8 minutes per game while Haley averaged 1.9 points in 8.0 minutes per game — both are athletic for their position and seem like good fits for Enfield’s fast-paced system.
Sophomore point guard Chass Bryan, a walk-on who played significant minutes last season, is also in the running to start.
Sophomore guard Brendyn Taylor and forward Strahinja Gavrilovic also return, but what they can do on the court in a true game situation is still up in the air. The same goes for the four incoming freshmen, guards Julian Jacobs and Kahlil Dukes and forwards Roschon Prince and Nikola Jovanovic.
“They need a lot of development, but they’re talented enough to help us and we expect them to be contributors,” Enfield said.
As last year’s campaign showed, change can be a good thing. After going a program-worst 6-26 in a 2011-12 campaign littered with devastating injuries and an overall dearth of talent, O’Neill was on thin ice heading into last season. That ice cracked after the Trojans started 7-10, and in came longtime assistant Bob Cantu as the interim head coach.
The move was largely successful. After averaging 63.7 points per game in the 17 games of O’Neill, the squad averaged near 80 in Cantu’s first three games.
Even though the team fizzled out down the stretch, losing its last three games to finish 14-18 overall and out of the postseason again, the change was palpable. Players seemed more emotionally invested on the court, big wins over UCLA and Arizona resulted in a small upswing of excitement at the Galen Center and memories of the 2006-07 squad that ran to the Sweet 16 were fleeting, if not actualized.
O’Neill’s defense-based system never seemed to be fully embraced by his players or the fan base, but with Enfield, the book on change is still valid.
“We want to average in mid-70s,” Enfield said.
Cantu’s run-and-gun system was popular during his 7-8 run at the helm to close last year, but besides increased scoring, don’t expect Enfield to keep around much furniture from the previous regime.
“No,” Special Assistant to the Head Coach Dieter Horton simply said when asked if Enfield’s new system is at all similar to Cantu’s. “Other than giving players some freedom with responsibility.”
The mantra of change is also applicable to the coaching staff. Outside of Horton, who was an assistant coach on O’Neill’s staff, Enfield brought a slew of new assistants with him to USC.
Hired from San Diego State, Tony Bland is the new head recruiter and noted for his prowess on the recruiting trail.
“I’ve been in college basketball for over 20 years, and Tony has a real knack for his ability to relate to kids and sift through the process to find out who’s the decision-maker and who’s important in the recruiting process,” Horton said.
Local legend Jason Hart played 10 years in the NBA before being hired from Pepperdine, while Kevin Norris was an assistant under Enfield at Florida Gulf Coast University last year.
On the court, Enfield wants listeners to know that while dunking and “Lob City” are certainly part of his game plan, they’re a by-product rather than a strategy.
“The misconception is that we don’t just roll the balls out and start running,” he said. “We have a very structured system. We have a lot of screening action, and our defense caused a lot of our offense.”
Horton estimates that 95 percent of Enfield’s first four months at USC were focused on recruiting, and after spending 15 of 19 straight days on the road in July, Enfield didn’t disagree.
There’s already been a fair amount of roster fluctuation in the last month with the additions of Haley and Howard and the loss of senior forward Ari Stewart due to academic ineligibility, so a lot could change between now and the start of practice on Sept. 27.
The expectations during this transition year shouldn’t be sky-high, but for now, the optimism is.

After three stellar performances to start the 2013 campaign, the USC women’s soccer team is ready to embark on its longest road trip of the season. The Women of Troy (3-0) will play twice in this weekend’s Minnesota Gold Classic in Minneapolis, beginning with a matchup against undefeated Mississippi on Friday at 2:30 p.m. On Sunday, the squad will take on LSU at 9 a.m.

No. 17 USC is coming off a resounding 4-1 victory over Cal State Northridge last weekend in its home opener. The contest was a solid demonstration of the balance and unselfishness USC has shown on both sides of the ball throughout the young season. These qualities, which the team hopes to continue to develop in Minnesota, have paid dividends for the Women of Troy. The team is now ranked for the second consecutive week, after failing to crack the national rankings all of last season.
Though the Women of Troy have been impressive in their early season games, they have yet to leave Southern California, only traveling as far as San Diego.
But sophomore Jamie Fink, who already has two goals under her belt this year, thinks her team is prepared to face the challenge of long-distance travel.
“The team has prepared really well,” Fink said. “We are constantly working hard and giving 100 percent effort in all practices.”
Fink also believes this type of road trip can prepare her team for the constant road battles they will have to fight during the Pac-12 season.
“Every team we play will prepare us for the Pac-12 season,” Fink said. “Both Ole Miss and LSU are very good, physical teams. They both have good records and we know this will be one of our toughest weekends so far.”
Freshman forward Kayla Mills echoed her teammate’s sentiments.
“We’ve worked really hard,” Mills said. “It’s really important that we hold ourselves to a standard and meet that standard every game.”
The squad’s first matchup of the weekend has the makings of an offensive shootout. USC’s explosive attack, led by reigning Pac-12 Player of the Week Elizabeth Eddy, has put up four goals in each of its first three games. The senior forward has a team-high four goals on the season, including one last week against Cal State Northridge. Not far behind are freshman phenoms Tanya Samarzich and Mills, who, combined, made five goals in their first three collegiate matches.
The Ole Miss (4-0) offense has been formidable as well, recording at least five goals in two separate games while racking up 16 goals in its four matches. The Rebels’ Mandy McCalla has put away five goals so far in the young season.
The Rebels’ defense has played excellently so far, as goalkeeper Kelly McCormick has only let up two goals while recording five saves and three shutouts.
The USC defense, led by junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley, has been up to the task in allowing four goals, but has yet to record a shutout and will have to work hard to keep the Rebels in check.
In LSU, the Women of Troy face an opponent that cannot be overlooked. The Tigers (2-1-1) have faced a rough early schedule, tying TCU 0-0 and losing valiantly to No. 6 BYU 4-2.
They’ve outscored their other opponents 7-0, with the offense typically getting off to a quick start  — eight of LSU’s nine goals this season have been scored in the first half.
Goalkeeper Megan Kinneman has allowed only four goals in four appearances this season, with BYU being the only team to find the back of the net against the Tigers. It will take continued offensive firepower from the Women of Troy’s dynamic frontline to break through the Tigers’ defense.
“The main focus is just to play our game and to never be satisfied with what we’ve done, because we can always improve,” Fink said. “The team is looking forward to this weekend and we are ready to battle and play hard.”

Usually the first game of the season answers questions about a team — it gives the team a chance to forge a sense of identity  and define structural parameters for expectations. When I covered spring practice almost six months ago, few games on the USC schedule mattered as much to me as USC-Hawai’i.
The reason was that the Trojans, coming off the most disappointing season for a preseason No. 1 team (numerically) in NCAA history, had yet to establish a sense of identity. The first game would presumably answer all questions — it would be the climax and denouement of a team’s preseason quest to find its soul.
In short, USC-Hawai’i was not that climax. What CBS Sports broadcasted to many of the Trojan faithful was essentially the same team I had seen in spring practices: The freakish athleticism of freshman tailback Justin Davis. The immediate game-changing abilities of freshman safety Su’a Cravens. A bloodthirsty front seven on defense. A risky man-coverage scheme that, if somehow cracked and exploited, could mean hemorrhaging points to Pac-12 offenses. And, of course, the game saw a rotation at quarterback between sophomores Cody Kessler and Max Wittek.
The last point was the most well-worn because it is, in fact, the most intriguing. USC head coach Lane Kiffin only added to the fire when he revealed he would name the starting quarterback in Saturday’s game against Washington State.
Ever since this past spring, anyone who knew about my access to the practices was asking me the same question: Kessler or Wittek? For fans of USC football, the anticipation was comparable to, say, the finale of the first season of American Idol. Justin or Kelly? Kessler or Wittek? Pick a side. Defend it.
I vacillated my allegiances as often as the two quarterbacks rotated with first team reps.
On the one side, there is Max Wittek. The quarterback’s steely, wolf-like features translate to his demeanor on the football field. In the huddle, Wittek is all business. Name the play, any routes or assignments, break. Line up. Audible if necessary. Cadence. Snap.
In the three-second whirlwind of blockers, jerseys, tight ends and defensive backs circling like vultures, Max Wittek simply stands still. His composure borders on stubborn defiance, and his 6-foot-4, 235-pound frame may justify it.
The one word that perhaps best describes Wittek’s on-field actions is “trust.” For one, he trusts his blockers to fashion him an adequate pocket. And, perhaps to their peril, he trusts his receivers to make the play. It’s been said that Wittek has a cannon of an arm, and, in Wittek’s case, it’s a sort of back-handed compliment. He fires in his receivers’ general direction and trusts them to come down with the ball. And why the hell wouldn’t he? His receivers are named Marqise Lee and Nelson Agholor.
But it’s that same attribute that, in turn, becomes his biggest flaw. In last year’s game against Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl, the wind rendered his giant passes virtually uncatchable. The Trojans’ once-vaunted offense became one-dimensional as it sputtered to an embarrassing 21-7 loss. He struggled in situational positions (something he’s worked on throughout the offseason) and worked on his shorter routes. But if Hawai’i showed us anything, it’s that Max Wittek might throw line drives but he still wants to hit the home run.
As fate would have it, Cody Kessler is Wittek’s foil. Lacking the natural physical gifts of his teammate, Kessler compensates by taking a more cerebral approach to the game. Kessler trusts his teammates. But unlike Wittek, he vocalizes that trust. He’s animated in the huddle, acknowledging good plays from his teammates and pointing out missed assignments.
Even after the snap, Kessler looks more animated — surveying the field while always half-poised to run should his protection break down. His shiftiness is by necessity — his 6-foot-1, 215-pound frame isn’t very conducive to punishment. Yet his toughness is every bit as real as Wittek’s. While the ball doesn’t whistle out of his hand, he has a respectable throwing arm. Where Kessler compensates in this regard is his ability to read what the defense gives him. Hawai’i may not have been such a great example, but Kessler would rather squeeze out a 3rd and 3 than take two shots downfield and be stuck with a 3rd and 10 situation.
Kessler’s easier smile is also a relief for the media, who hang onto his detailed breakdowns and seem drawn to his affable demeanor. By contrast, Wittek is a compendium of one-sentence answers and sports clichés. There couldn’t be two more different pro-style quarterbacks in college football and yet they’re vying for the same job.
At some point, head coach Lane Kiffin is going to have to end the speculation and pick a definitive starter (beware the dual-quarterback system), but you get an idea of why the decision is so hard. He’s picking between schools of thought, between methods of leadership and between personalities. Ultimately one will prevail and become the heart of this offense, and it’s all in Lane Kiffin’s hands.
For a campus that boasts perhaps the finest film school in the country, it’s a little funny that USC’s football coach is crafting its most compelling storyline.
With a markedly renewed running game, great defensive line and incredibly talented receivers, USC simply needs someone who can get the ball downfield, especially a long ball. Witteck seems to be the guy to do it.There are plenty of “personalities” on the team. A “cerebral” approach from Kiffen is not making it happen with a bunch of talented, huge play makers for USC. A cerebral approach at QB would seem to stifle the magic that can happen for USC football.
It is just too disorienting for this team to juggle between such different QB styes and seems to be preventing USC from establishing an identity and rhythm this year.
 Just one fan’s opinion

After an uneven performance in its season-opening victory against Hawai’i, and with fresh memories of an upset-filled week one of college football, the USC football team enters its home and Pac-12 opener against Washington State knowing two things: There is definite room for improvement, and a win is never guaranteed.
Thrust into the spotlight · With senior tailback Silas Redd injured, freshman Justin Davis (22) paired up with redshirt sophomore Tre Madden against Hawai’i to give the Trojans a fearsome 1-2 punch in the backfield. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
“We want to improve from week one to week two, like everybody does,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “We want to be more consistent in our passing game, which will help with our third down production. We want to finish drives inside the five, and pitch a shutout on turnovers [on offense].”
True, the Trojan offense left much to be desired in the passing game. Neither of the team’s redshirt sophomore quarterbacks, Cody Kessler and Max Wittek, played lights-out against the Warriors, though key drops by their receivers and some leaky pass protection from the offensive line exacerbated things considerably.
But lost in the mystery surrounding which player will start at quarterback has been the Trojans’ solid rushing attack, led by two inexperienced but talented running backs in redshirt sophomore Tre Madden and freshman Justin Davis. The duo combined for 183 rushing yards on 32 carries in their collegiate debuts at the position, giving the offense a much-needed spark.
Though the emergence of a clear-cut starting quarterback would be a heralded outcome from Saturday’s game, look for the offense to again lean on its ground game against the Cougars’ run defense. Last week against Auburn, Washington State allowed 295 yards on 46 rush attempts, good for an average of 6.4 yards per rush in a 31-24 loss. With the possibility of senior tailback Silas Redd returning to action, USC could have an even more potent rushing attack.
“I don’t know that [the running game] will change much [with Redd back],” Kiffin said. “We ran more times [against Hawai’i] than we have in three years here, and that was a product of the way the game was going. That’s a great thing to have, so hopefully we’ll have that again Saturday night.”
On defense, USC will face a Cougar attack molded by head coach Mike Leach that focuses primarily on throwing the ball. Starting quarterback Connor Halliday had 65 pass attempts against Auburn last week, falling just one shy of the school record. He completed 35 of them, good for 53.8 percent, and had one touchdown and three interceptions, including one fourth-quarter pick in the end zone as the Cougars were on the verge of tying the game.
“He played a really great game [against Auburn],” Kiffin said. “He played really well, was really accurate. He was very poised in the pocket, didn’t let the rush get to him and kept his eyes downfield. He played really well, and he had some great games last year, too.”
Despite Halliday’s high volume of throws, the Cougars showed a formidable run game against Auburn that had been absent in Leach’s first year at the helm. After accumulating just 349 rushing yards last season, Washington State ran 23 times for 120 yards against the Tigers, good for 5.2 yards per rush.
“We know they’re pass-heavy, but we think they’re gonna try and run the ball too,” senior defensive end Devon Kennard said. “They did a better job running the ball [against Auburn] than they have in the past, and I think they’re gonna try and do that on us too.”
With Washington State’s newfound success on the ground, stopping the team’s aerial attack will be a more difficult task. Leach is well known for his prolific passing offenses, and his reputation is not lost on members of the Trojan secondary.
“You have to keep your eyes open, and you can’t take any plays off,” redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw said. “You have to treat every down like it’s third down. Last week they passed the ball [a lot] versus Auburn, and if you go back to last year they were passing even more than that.”
In the USC secondary, questions linger as to who will start. Redshirt junior Anthony Brown and sophomore Kevon Seymour started at cornerback against Hawai’i, though both left the game early because of injuries. Senior Torin Harris and redshirt freshman Devian Shelton played in their absence, and both were shaky at times covering receivers down the field. Shelton was burned on a last-minute Hail Mary that gave Hawai’i its only touchdown.
The entire secondary will have the luxury of leaning on the defense’s stout front seven, which is coming off of a dominant effort against the Warriors. It recorded seven sacks and three quarterback hurries even without the presence of senior defensive end Morgan Breslin, who earned an All-American honorable mention last season but didn’t step on the field against Hawai’i because of an injury.
That relentless pressure played a large role in the four interceptions that Hawai’i quarterback Taylor Graham threw, and could continue to help take pressure off of a largely unproven secondary.
“[Pressuring the quarterback] is always important, but especially in this game because of the amount of passing,” Kiffin said. “We’re gonna have to play really well with our front because we’re gonna have to leave a lot of guys deep to be able to cover them.”
USC and Washington State have not played since 2010, when USC won 50-16 in Pullman, Wash. The Cougars have not beaten the Trojans since 2002, and have not won at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 2000. Their last win against a ranked opponent was a 34-23 win over No. 16 Oregon in 2006.
Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m., and the game will be broadcast on FOX  Sports 1.

Students flocked to McCarthy Quad Thursday afternoon to sample a variety of food and drink at the biannual Taste of Downtown Los Angeles event. The gathering, organized by the Special Events Committee of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board, featured complimentary tasting samples so that students could try new and different cuisine.
Denise Rockstroh, assistant director of Program Board, and Taylor Wong, publicity chair of Program Board, spearheaded the event, which has been in the works since April. This year, it drew nearly 2,500 students and 11 eateries, including two food trucks.
“We have a good mix of old favorites and new vendors this year,” Wong said.
Some local favorites included Viztango, an Italian restaurant on Figueroa, and Spitz, a European style take on Turkish street food, with a nearby location in Little Tokyo. Chichen Itza, located in the Mercado La Paloma, featured crowd pleasing Mexican food from the Yucatan peninsula.
“Many students don’t have cars, especially freshmen, so going off campus and finding these restaurants might not be a possibility for them,” Rockstroh said. “Bringing all these restaurants and vendors to USC and making them available is a great opportunity for everyone to try new foods. It’s definitely gained more popularity since we started it.”
Though most restaurants brought around 400 food items, some brought more to cater to an impressive demand.
“Vendors who have been here before know how many students come, so they are well prepared,” Wong said.
Eateries at the event included Fickle L.A., a new restaurant in Little Tokyo and Bird Pick Tea & Herb from Pasadena. Dina Levashova, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, especially enjoyed Bird Pick’s hibiscus tea, a specialty of the teahouse.
“I’ve never been to eat off campus,” Levashova said. “Maybe I’ll try it more often, because I did like Viztango.”
Many students agreed with Levashova that the event encouraged them to try off-campus food.
“I have a meal plan, so that makes it harder to go out. But I’ll definitely try out more places,” Linda Xu, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said.
Though many of the restaurants were local and individually-owned, some larger restaurateurs were giving out their samples. Built, a local restaurant owned by The Counter burgers, was one of the larger companies present at the event, serving hormone-free beef and turkey burgers. The Lobos truck, also new this year, brought its “comfort food with a conscience” to the quad. Vendors that frequent the USC campus, such as the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, as well as Popchips, Hubert’s Lemonade and Jarrito’s took to McCarthy, as well.
Despite the heat, the event was so popular that many restaurants ran out of offerings. In fact, every company present except for Viztango Cafe, the Lobos Truck and the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf ran out of food before 2 p.m.
Tito Rivera, owner of Viztango Cafe, noted that the event was about food, as well as an opportunity to come together with the USC community. Tito also works with student organizations to help them raise money. All nonprofit organizations who sign in with Viztango receive 20 percent of their transactions back.
“We try to get closer to the students, to the community and organizations. We come to Taste of Downtown L.A. every time to connect with the new students so they can know what our restaurant is about,” Rivera said.
Students waited in long lines for many of the restaurants, especially Viztango and Chichen Itza, in order to try foods that they otherwise might not have had the opportunity to come across.
“I don’t eat out that often, but I like when all the restaurants come to me,” Ashley Holman, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, said.
The event, and the draw of complimentary food, also reflected the amount of cultural diversity in the area around USC.
“L.A.’s one of the most diverse places: you have Mexican food, Asian food, Italian food,” Wong said. “It’s great that students have an experience where they can go to one place and taste all these different foods.”

Thanks to the work of a team of USC students led by Professor Chongwu Zhou of the Viterbi School of Engineering, it’s  possible to create a system that consistently produces carbon nanotubes in a predictable and specific manner.
More than three years of research in engineering labs, carbon nanotubes now have the potential to be far smaller, faster and consume less power than silicon transistors. Until recently, researchers were unable to create carbon nanotubes with specific, predictable properties making the material less applicable to products such as cell phones, computers and other technologies.
“Our method can revolutionize the scientific field and significantly push forward the real applications of nanotubes in many fields,” Zhou told USC News.
Before USC’s discovery of this process, referred to as “nanotube cloning,” a key reason carbon nanotubes were not used in computers and cell phones was because they are difficult to manufacture to the correct size, chirality, a property of asymmetry and type. This lack of control resulted in scientists’ inability to control nanotubes’ electrical and mechanical properties.
“Controlling the chirality of carbon nanotubes has been a dream for many researchers. Now the dream has come true,” Zhou said.
Zhou and his team of USC students planted pieces of carbon nanotubes that had been separated and pre-selected based on chirality, using a special nanotube separation technique developed by co-author Ming Zheng and his co-workers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Using these pieces as seeds, the team used chemical vapor deposition to enlarge the seeds to get longer nanotubes. The team has already patented their revolutionary innovation and their research was published in the journal Nature. Communications.
“Carbon nanotubes, I know, are more convenient than using silicon just because they make up stronger materials in building equipment. And they can minimize space because they are smaller,” Maariyah Patel, a freshman majoring neuroscience, said.
Soon, instead of having to use rare and expensive earth elements such as gallium, indium and arsenic for cell phones, the common and cheap element carbon can be utilized in the mass production of frequently used technology, especially cell phones.
“I think it’s a find that will prove itself to be hugely economical in a number of sectors, even outside of medicine,” said Deepika Bodapati, a freshman majoring in computer Biomedical Engineering (Mechanical Engineering). “If carbon nanotubes can be successfully used as a semiconductors we have a huge opportunity for positive growth in the future, especially in the tech market.”

The four inaugural students of the USC International Artist Fellowship program began their academic endeavors at the university on Aug. 26.
The IAF, which was announced at USC’s 2011 Global conference in Hong Kong, highlights the university’s six arts schools and their place in Los Angeles. Provost Elizabeth Garrett has been an active member in initiating and overseeing the fellowship.
The program welcomes fellows who are pursuing graduate degrees in the arts to USC for two or three years. Tuition, travel and living expenses are provided so the students can focus on their work.
Though all four fellows are pursuing degrees in the arts, none are in the same program, or even school, at USC.
Fei Kayser, a resident of Beijing, is currently studying dramatic writing.
“I want to write things that are funny and accessible, and not in a didactic style,” she told USC News.
Kayser will be working with USC professors Velina Hasu Houston and Olivia Mayer, while studying for her M.F.A. in dramatic writing at the USC School of Dramatic Arts and anticipates writing two plays per year during her stay.
Vladimir Gorbach, a Russian guitarist who won the Guitar Foundation of America’s International Concert Artist Competition, which prized him a 50-city concert tour, began his classical guitar studies at USC Thornton with professor William Kanengiser.
Jacinto Astiazaran, who spent the last three years in Mexico, has had his multidisciplinary work exhibited on platforms including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He told USC News that he wants to “make videos that focus on the social issues between the United States and Mexico.” Astiazaran is studying for his M.F.A. in fine arts at the USC Roski School of Fine Arts.
The final inaugural fellow, Brazilian Frederico Fernandez, hopes to continue his street art and make as many animated films as possible in the next three years while also working toward his M.F.A. in animation and digital arts from USC School of Cinematic Arts.
“In the future, perhaps I’ll be making independent live action films as a director,” he told USC News.
The fellowship is expected to grow to the point of including about 15 people, who will have the opportunity to work in Los Angeles’ leading arts industries, including Hollywood and the Downtown arts corridor.

On Thursday, officials from USC, the California Science Center Board of Directors, the Coliseum Commission and various other officials from the city of Los Angeles, the county of Los Angeles and the state of California met to sign a new lease regarding the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The signing occurred the day after the California Science Center board of directors gave the final approval in a unanimous vote.
Money well-spent · USC plans to spend $100 million in renovations, including $70 million in the first 10 years. The university has also committed to pay the state $1 million in annual rent for naming rights. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Coliseum has been the home of Trojan football since its opening in 1923, and has remained a landmark in Los Angeles since then. It is the only stadium to have hosted two Olympic games, as well as two Super Bowls and a World Series, and will host the 2015 Special Olympics. With a capacity of  more than 93,000 people, it is also one of the largest stadiums in Los Angeles.
“[The Coliseum] represents Trojan pride in our football team, how much we care for it and how it represents USC,” Joyce Zhan, a freshman majoring in biology, said.
The deal was finally approved after nearly two years of negotiation, and marks the transfer of the master lease from the Coliseum Commission to USC. The deal guarantees a restoration of the stadium as well. USC has committed to about $100 million in renovations, including $70 million in the first 10 years.
As the sole continuous tenant of the Coliseum since its opening, USC has been in position to gain control of the master lease since the Coliseum Commission made clear two years ago that it would be unable to make the $50 million in renovations promised to the unviersity.
“This agreement assures that Expo Park will remain a community asset that provides recreation to thousands of kids and their families,” Fabian Wesson, the chair of the California Science Center Board of Directors, said.
USC President C. L. Max Nikias spoke at the signing, where the Trojan marching band also made an appearance.
“Throughout USC’s enduring connection to the Coliseum, we have been committed to making it a source of pride not only for the present moment, but also for generations far into the future,” Nikias said.
The deal also gives control of the Sports Arena to USC. USC will pay $1 million in annual rent to the state, and must also pay the state 5 percent of the receipts for naming rights. This marks the transfer of the Coliseum from a publicly owned structure to a privately owned and operated structure.
“This is a great day not just for USC but for the neighborhood and the whole city of L.A. We’re planning to do a restoration, and this will continue to be the home of Trojan football for another 99 years,” Nikias said in a short message to the USC student body.
Overall, the officials who spoke at the signing all expressed their satisfaction with the deal and their thanks to everyone who had helped them in the long two year negotiations, which were originally supposed to last 90 days or less.
Don Knabe, president of the Coliseum Commission and supervisor for the fourth district of L.A. County, applauded the deal as a great example of “public [and]private partnership” and said that he “look[s] forward to the preservation and improvement of this iconic building for generations of Southern Californians to enjoy.”
“I think the renovations that USC has done in the surrounding area, as well as on its own campus, are a testament to how well the school maintains and improves its property,” Chasen Washington, an undecided freshman, said. “I hope that the lease will make up for the years the Coliseum has been forgotten by the city and restore the beauty of its architecture and its legacy.”
Many of the speakers also mentioned their wish for the Coliseum to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.
“We look forward to having the Opening Ceremonies of the 2015 Special Olympics World Games in the Coliseum two summers from now, and we hope that this renaissance of the Coliseum under USC leadership will also bolster the pending proposal of Los Angeles to the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as the U.S. candidate to host the 2024 Summer Olympics,” Knabe said.
USC officials also expressed a desire to make the Coliseum a landmark for future generations to come.
“We look forward to restoring and upgrading the coliseum to its former glory … We also welcome educational partnerships that will attract more students and families to Exposition Park, and we will ensure that the coliseum will stand proudly in the heart of Los Angeles in the 21st century,” Nikias said.

Etchea on Figueroa has only been open for four weeks, but the owners of the bakery are already opening a second location on Hope Street in Downtown Los Angeles. Etchea — which means “home” in French — is expanding with good reason: People have been flocking to the cafe, where croissants, muffins and croque monsieurs are selling out daily.
Bread winners · Etchea’s French-style sandwiches emphasize the taste of their breads by keeping the contents simple and understated. – Alegra Hueso | Daily Trojan
What sets Etchea apart from the neighborhood corner bakery or Panera is that the menu includes home-away-from-home pastries such as their Gateau Basque, an almond-infused dessert with a cheesecake-like consistency — a treat from the Basque regions of France.
The bakery’s in-house pastry chef bakes delicacies fresh daily and entices would-be customers by displaying them in the front window. The bakery also serves breakfast, soups, salads, sandwiches, main courses and organic coffee and tea.
Etchea’s uniqueness is also reinforced by its atmosphere: It brings a cozy neighborhood feel to a busy metropolis. Its patrons range from nearby office workers looking for a lean lunch to students who appreciate Etchea’s reasonable prices.
If a customer wants some homemade granola for breakfast, he or she can order a delicious blend of nuts, dried fruits and oats paired with yogurt and fresh berries. For purists and snackers, the granola is good enough to be eaten alone and comes in two forms: as part of a meal, or bagged as a healthy snack to eat on the go.
Lunch offerings include the Atlantic smoked salmon sandwich and the Basque Serrano chile and a chile aioli. The cold sandwiches are packaged for immediate take-out but don’t skimp on the flavor. Etchea also offers an assortment of imported drinks including a crisp French limonade (a sparkling lemonade), ginger ale and sweet root beer.
Etchea’s grilled chicken breast sandwich comes highly recommended; it’s loaded chock full of avocado along with some red onion and Anaheim chilies served on fresh sourdough bread. One thing of note is that Etchea’s European-style sandwiches differ from the fat, layered Dagwood variety Americans might be accustomed to. They have very few ingredients in between the bread, and mostly consist of meat and cheese with a thin layer of spread. The idea is that the bread should be a point of emphasis — not just a tasteless vessel that keeps the ingredients together.
That idea is taken to an extreme with the croque monsieur — hands down one of the best brunch items on the menu. Dubbed by an employee to be “ham and cheese on steroids,” diners might call it “to die for.” It’s a warm and classy take on a grilled ham and cheese sandwich wrapped in special bread — delivered from its partner bakery — that offers a delightful crunch as you bite into it.
Etchea doesn’t stop there — they offer a slew of vegetarian and vegan options. Vegans will certainly appreciate the zucchini, mushroom and basil soup, delicious whether served cold or warm. The soup is a delightful blend of all three ingredients, but the basil makes the soup, serving as a canvas for the flavors of zucchini and mushroom. It’s an ideal choice for summer, one that feels light as a feather. Of course, the soup also comes partnered with one of Etchea’s artisan rolls.
Vegans and vegetarian will also take comfort in a seasonal salad. The current one comes with avocado, grapefruit, red onion and citrus dressing, another light and healthy option that has a sweet taste with a bite of citrus from the grapefruit. Rounding out the vegetarian options is the Pizza Style Basquaise, which can be served without any meat and piles peppers, tomatoes, cheese and kalamata olives atop warm, crispy ciabatta bread, perfect for a light lunch date or a large late-afternoon snack.
There’s something comforting about the concept of a homey French restaurant in the middle of bustling Downtown Los Angeles; the restaurant gives off the vibe that it’s a little oasis where people can relax during food breaks throughout the day.
 
Etchea Cafe Bakery and Market, 254 S. Hope St. and 2280 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, Calif., 7 a.m. – 7 p.m. daily. Ample parking is available on location.

Have a conversation about the state of movies today, and you’ll soon hit the topic of sequels — right after the words “remakes” and “vampire movies.” The proliferation of sequels is often cited as one of the signs of the decay of the movie industry. It’s an example of the money-obsessed nature of movie studios, since sequels of already-successful movies are, after all, usually safer than new, original and untested projects.
Sequels are all over the place. The third installment of the Chronicles of Riddick series comes out this weekend, Insidious 2 follows next weekend and, this summer, we got Fast & Furious 6, The Hangover 3 and Iron Man 3. They are everywhere, and people are right, a primary driving force for this trend is their better chance at a good return in box office sales.
The decay in the integrity of moviemaking has pushed viewers largely toward television, a medium in the middle of a so-called “golden age.” Proponents of television will cite its ability, through the much longer run-time of a television season versus a two-hour movie, to develop characters further and experiment more inventively with variations on themes.
Television is really great in these regards: A writer and actor will always be able to develop characters and plotlines in more inventive and complex ways in a canvas of 13 47-minute episodes than in one two-hour space. These areas of strength that TV converts flaunt, however, are the same ones that adding sequels to a successful movie can augment. Sequels, building on source material that generally was popular or well-regarded — Grown-Ups 2 or Smurfs 2 notwithstanding — can further develop characters and explore themes that a single movie couldn’t.
Take Iron Man 3. The film was able to explore themes and character traits that would be hard to establish in a single film. Iron Man was a great movie, but it required an extended period of character establishment (just like the first few episodes of a TV show season) that was no longer required in the sequels. The time that was used in Iron Man to show us the creation of Iron Man, was used in 2 and 3 (and The Avengers) to show Tony Stark evolve as a person while simultaneously exploring old (Tony’s dangerous arrogance) and new (revenge, resurrection, and more.) themes in more depth.
Another flick that came out this year, Before Midnight, took the opportunities offered by this extra screen time to the next level, building from the beautiful Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, to provide a third window into the relationship and lives of its two main characters that could not have been done without the already-established storylines from the two previous films. It allows the movie to dive directly into the action, just as the tenth episode of a show allows itself to do so by virtue of being so far into the narrative at its onset. We know the characters and we know what’s happened to them — we are ready to see what happens next.
Of course, there are unnecessary sequels, prolonging a series of movies too far. There is only so long a story can be extended and remain engaging. This is perceived to happen, however, much more often than it actually does. A television show has the advantage of coming out with a new episode weekly; that short amount of time between episodes being released allows a viewer to remain engaged in a storyline and world (naturally, this effect is greatly augmented when binge-watching a show on Netflix).
The time between the releases of installments in a film series is in the scale of years. A movie universe that comes out in 2008 has been around for three years by the time the sequel comes out in 2011, despite only offering two hours of actual time inside of it. In the same period of time, a television show could offer more than 30 hours of story and developments and characters.
In this case, absence does not make the heart grow fonder. The longer waiting time for the next movie hurts its perception on two seemingly opposite fronts: First, by being gone a long time, a movie series cannot hold on to its audience’s attention as firmly as a show that comes out weekly, and then lets you wait less than a year for the new season. Second, the absence — despite taking the universe out of sight — does not take it out of mind (especially with the onslaught of merchandise). You feel the three years of age that the world has accrued, making it feel more familiar and, thus, less original than episodes in the equivalent place of a TV series. It is an uphill battle.
Sure, there are bad sequels. Just like there are plenty of bad original movies. Just like there are plenty of bad television episodes. The fact that a movie is a sequel should not evoke the sort of prejudice that it does. Bad movies come out all the time. Good movies are hard to make, and being a sequel should not totally discount a movie’s quality for its own sake.

The historic Hollywood Bowl is home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic and has played host to the likes of Kristin Chenoweth and Yo-Yo Ma. The SoCal VoCals will be performing on the same stage this Sunday. This comes as no surprise, as hundreds of students packed Bovard Auditorium Monday night for the annual All Hail A Capella festival, which featured seven major a capella groups on campus. For the rest of the week, aca-hopefuls packed the hallways of the Raubenheimer Music Building, practicing scales to try and earn their place on stage. Interest was so high that many groups extended their auditions an extra day, carrying over until late Thursday night.
Ah, compelling · SoCal VoCals member Myles Nuzzi (front) and the rest of the SoCal VoCals a capella group will be performing at ABBA Fest at the Hollywood Bowl in a sing-off against a capella groups Soundcheck and Scattertones from Chapman University and UCLA, respectively. – Courtesy of SoCal VoCals
The SoCal VoCals, who hosted Monday’s concert, had a particularly busy week. In addition to All Hail and auditions, the group is slated to perform this weekend at ABBA Fest, the annual tribute to the iconic Swedish pop group that will take place at the Hollywood Bowl this Sunday, Sept. 8. The VoCals will be going head to head in a sing-off with “The Scattertones” and “SoundCheck,” a cappella groups from UCLA and Chapman University, respectively.
“We really had to hit the ground running,” said Richard Mattox, a junior narrative studies major and president of the SoCal VoCals. “We only had two weeks since the start of school to really put this together.”
Founded in 1996, the SoCal VoCals are USC’s oldest a cappella group. They give regular concerts at USC and perform at gigs and competitions in Los Angeles and around the country. The VoCals currently have 13 singers — five female and eight male — after three members graduated last year. Those spaces will soon be filled after the conclusion of auditions this week. Myles Nuzzi, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies and a member of the VoCals said filling the vacancies is no simple task.
“When we do auditions, we don’t say, ‘Oh, we just need three people’,” Nuzzi said. “[But] if you’re talented, we’ll take you.”
For ABBA Fest, the VoCals will be performing their own arrangements of ABBA hits “Does Your Mother Know” and “Voulez-Vous.” The process of song selection is democratic: The group meets to pitch song ideas and vote on selections. Every member helps out with arranging the music, but more experienced members typically take on a greater share of the work. The arrangements for both of the songs for ABBA Fest were done by Nathan Fertig, a junior majoring in popular music and a member of the VoCals.
“Since the audience is going to be full of huge ABBA fans, we felt like we could take a little more liberty in choosing slightly lesser known songs, compared to ‘Dancing Queen’ or ‘Mamma Mia,’” Mattox said. “The arrangements we have are truly amazing.”
The a capella sing-off, which is a new addition to ABBA Fest, will take place during the first half of the show, after which a tribute band from Sweden will play a selection of ABBA’s greatest hits.
Requests for gigs such as this are not new to the VoCals, who performed in places such as Miami and Las Vegas last year.
“A lot of times, people will fly us out and put us up places for gigs, even if they don’t pay us,” Nuzzi said. “Last year we went to Vegas for 24 hours, and we got put up at the Bellagio, you know, little spur-of-the-moment things like that.”
Still, an invitation to perform at the Hollywood Bowl doesn’t come every day.
“The invitation was just an out-of-the-blue email request,” said Mattox. “When we saw it we were like, ‘Wow, of course we want to do this.’”
Understandably, with the long hours of rehearsing together, the VoCals are a very tight-knit group.
“We’re like a family, we like to have fun,” Nuzzi said.
The VoCals will be working hard for the next few days to prepare for their big performance but are excited for this huge opportunity.
“It’s easy for us to take things for granted sometimes,” said Mattox. “But we’re probably never going to be able to perform at the Hollywood Bowl again, and it’s something not a lot of people get to do, so we’re still trying to take it all in.”
 
Tickets for the show are available online at hollywoodbowl.com.

By sending forces to Syria, the country could prevent the slaughter of civilians. 
Nancy Chiu | Daily Trojan
Now, once again, the world stands at a crossroads — this time with Syria. Should military force be used for human rights? According to CNN, President — some would say dictator — Bashar al-Assad has shown blatant disregard for human life in his continued use of conventional and now chemical weapons against the civilian population.
The U.S. is currently divided on the issue of intervention, but it must realize that the country has a moral obligation to act and an ability to actually make a real difference in the conflict.
The U.N. estimates that there have been more than 100,000 killed in the conflict so far, with nearly two million refugees fleeing from the violence.
The death toll will only rise as the Assad regime continues to target civilians in the hopes that the people of Syria will become weary of the violence and end their support of rebel forces. As the civil war continues, so will the flight of civilians from their homes in Syria to neighboring countries. Pressure from refugees in the form of required land, food, water and shelter to care for these displaced people puts a strain on neighboring countries and strains diplomatic ties in the region. As bad as the situation in Syria is, refugee camps in neighboring Turkey or Jordan are only marginally better with similarly low quality of life for these refugees. According to the Los Angeles Times, the number of Syrian refugees has passed two million.
This massive loss of life and human migration threatens the stability of the Middle East, an already unstable region. And though intervention should have taken place months ago, it is even more crucial now because of Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Such an intervention can, proverbially speaking, kill two birds with one stone: It will help end the violence as well as send a message worldwide that the U.S. will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons.
Assad is waging a Cold War-style assault against the population, using troops, tanks and planes. These military assets, unlike jihadi fighters, are readily identifiable and easily targetable, according to the Foreign Affairs Journal. And though there are some risks involved, the U.S. has a moral obligation to help the defenseless citizens of Syria.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking before the Senate on Tuesday, called critics of American intervention “armchair isolationists” and out of touch with the reality of the threats to human life on the ground, according to The Guardian. When describing the hundreds of children gassed by their own despotic leader, Kerry clearly laid out the obligation that the U.S. has as citizens of the world.
It’s time for the United States to step up and stop the killing in Syria. The human tragedy in the region has gone on long enough, and the United States has the military capability to end civilian killings.

Intervention in Syria will not fix its most pertinent issues and is a waste of U.S. resources.
According to Global Issues, American military intervention in Afghanistan’s Soviet War caused the formation of Al-Qaeda. In fact, America provided vital arms and training to Afghan rebel fighters, who much like Syrian rebel fighters, were fighting against what was then perceived as an authoritarian regime. Nearly 30 years later, these misguided actions resulted in hundreds of thousands of lost lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well wasted resources and a 10-plus year war — the longest in U.S. history.
Al-Qaeda is not the only example of failed U.S. policies in action. According to recently released documents provided by NPR, in 1953 the American CIA coordinated with British spy agency MI6 to overthrow the democratically-elected prime minister of Iran in order to control oil exports. According to the BBC, after years of oppression by the U.S.-backed Iranian king, the Iranian people revolted in 1979, creating what is today known as the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to Reuters, this is the same government that is the Syrian regime’s No. 1 ally and the same government that constantly threatens use of nuclear power and weapons against Israel and other U.S.-allied countries.
More recent examples of Arab-spring type uprisings show the futility of outside intervention for ‘moral purposes’. In 2011, the UN Security Council approved a “no-fly zone” over Libya, an action which eventually resulted in the death of Libya’s dictatorial leader, Muammar Gaddafi.
Though this military intervention was hailed as a success, recent goings-on in Libya have shown otherwise. As an article from the United Kingdom’s Independent Magazine stated: “As world attention focused on the coup in Egypt and the poison gas attack in Syria over the past two months, Libya has plunged unnoticed into its worst political and economic crisis since the defeat of Gaddafi two years ago.”
Current violent uncertainty in Egypt is an additional warning against not only American intervention, but also intervention from the world. On Thursday, the latest violence in Egypt included an assassination attempt against the interior minister, leaving one dead and at least twenty people seriously wounded. As Obama stated in his meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday, “This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan.” And yet, the Syrian conflict could certainly be Libya, Egypt, or even 1979-era Iran.
It is not enough justification that the U.S., in its intervention, would stop Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from further massacring his people using chemical weapons. As history has shown time and again, matters in the Middle East are never as simple as sending in the military to stop some crazed dictator. The situation afterwards is often exacerbated, leading to longterm violence and instability.
After Saddam Hussein’s ousting in 2003, sectarian violence took over and life for Iraqi people today is not substantially better than what it was before, according to The New York Times.
Though it is commendable that foreign governments claim humanitarianism as reasoning to invade Syria, there must be a solution for the long-term consequences. Obama, however, in the same conference with lawmakers, pledged that a strike on Syria would be “limited” — but this is clearly a self-defeating prophecy.
Any strike in the Middle East requires at least a decades-long commitment to ensure stability, but so far this involvement has not solved the remaining problems in Iraq, Afghanistan, or any other Middle Eastern nations that the U.S. has had the misfortune of being involved in. Additionally, the U.S. and world powers do not have the desire nor support to begin another decades-long war.
Therefore, any strike in Syria — a region entwined in socio-political and religious issues — by a foreign power that does not understand such history, will be more deadly not only for the Syrian people, but for any foreign power involved.

usa motivation is not humanitarian.
Suadi’s top spy, prince Bandar who supplies the money to rebels and some say supplied the Chemicals to them is worse than Asad.
It is  politics of fighting a proxy war on Israel’s behalf and push their agenda in the region, otherwise it would also bomb or punish Israel for use of white phosphorous by Israelis.
They burned children in the schools by bomb drops. 
Brian,
Do you see vampires at night too?
It’s my opinion that Muslims “frustration” with America has little to do with our policies vis-a-vis Israel and has more to do with Islam.  Islam and its supremacist, hate-filled ideology.  How else can one explain Islam’s violently aggressive roles in the following regions where the Israeli situation is non-existent.  The common denominator IS Islam.
* The unrelenting ethnic cleansing of all Hindus from their ancient homelands in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
* Genocide of black Africans and Animists in Sudan., Mali and elsewhere.
* Ethnic cleansing of Christians from Nigeria, Pakistan, Iraq, Egypt.
* Slaughter of 5,000 Buddhists in Thailand in recent years.
* Violence against Russians and the same against Chinese in recent years.
* Sunni and Shi’ite murder of Kurds.
* Endless violence between Sunnis and Shi’ites with one million (!) killed in the Iraq/Iran war alone.
* Wholesale murder of all gays in Iran and across the Muslim world.
* Ethnic cleansing of Bahia in Iran.
* Endless war crimes in Syria.
* Ethnic cleansing of Berbers in North Africa.
* Random and consistent terrorist attacks against all Western embassies and citizens across the globe.
The only common denominator is Islam. If Israel were eliminated by Ahmadinejad this would not change our dynamics with the Middle East.  It is only when we give up our freedom of speech, freedom of individual rights and become more like the UN, i.e., a subsidiary of the OIC that they will begin to put up with us.
When the Buddhists in Thailand give up their land then, and only then, will Muslim aggression against these peace-loving people end; and the same is true for Israel.

yes the civilize world should not stand by and let the horror of chemical weapon use go unpunished. but bombing will only mean destroying inanimate materials and not the cruel minds that used these horrible weapons. why don’t the u s and its allies establish a neutral section within syria where all these refugees can go and be protected by their military might. in this safe haven the assad regine will be obligated to feed, clothe and shelter the people he caused to be displaced. let this monster share the responsibilities of mending the casualies he caused. in other words, show that you care for humanity by dealing with the problem in a humane way. with your might behind this humane effort, don;t you think the world will smile at your benevolent gesture and those evil doers will be put to shame?
Zionist Israel has murdered more than 10,000 innocent Palestinians and made more homeless and penniless. More than 1,000,000 Palestinians are in refugee camps in lands foreign to them. Humanitarian reasons? Are Palestinians not humans? Is it not Zionist Israel that fomented the Syrian crisis and surreptitiously shipped weapons to the criminal terrorist rebels?
Abram,
Given that you support the Palestinians who openly advocate Jewish genocide (see their duly elected leaders clear-cut party covenants), you correspondingly do as well. It’s hard to believe in this day and age that anyone would openly advocate the liquidation of Jews, but you clearly do and it doesn’t seem to bother you a whit.
Moreover, it would be hard to believe that anyone would support second class status for women, the honor murder of teenage girls, the brutalization of gays and the suppression of dissenters. But you, as supporters of the Palestinians who regularly practice all of the above, are therefore complicit in these sexist, racist and fascist beliefs as well.
Why are you so bigoted, misogynist, anti-gay and such hater of Jews? Please tell us pray tell.
And if to be opposed to such garbage practiced by so many Muslims world-wide makes one an Islamophobe, count me and all who believe in freedom and hate sexism and bigotry vs Jews as a proud Islamophobe.
The situation in the US is of it’s own making – arming and supporting insurgents, most of whom aren’t even Syrian, thus dragging on a bitter war in which atrocities are being committed by both sides.  
This whole notion of ‘sending a message’ to Assad would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious. Is this really the best that the so called ‘civilized’ nations of the world can come up with?  If humanitarian reasons really are the reason, then offer humanitarian aid not bombs – but it is clear to most that military intervention is a pretext for further expansion into the Middle East – this was the case with Iraq.  They promise ‘no boots on the ground’ – but Syria will not take a strike lying down, and things will escalate swiftly –  Iran has pledged that they will attack Israel if the US attacks Syria – what sort of ‘punishment’ will Obama be drawing up for that? 
Then there’s the matter of the military action being a direct violation of International law.  The U.N was created to prevent future wars – what gives the US the right to walk roughshod over it?  And finally there is the very real chance that Russia, and even China are dragged into this – essentially bringing about World War 3 … millions could die,  and all because of US intervention in a country where it has no right to be involved. There isn’t even concrete evidence to support the allegations that the chemical attacks were carried out by Assad – and to anybody with any background knowledge on the subject, it wouldn’t even make sense for him to do so. 
Should the US involve itself in the Syrian Confict?  Seemingly even most US citizens are against it – maybe Obama could try listening to his own people before deciding to unleash hell upon this earth.
“Humanterian reasons” !,. you must be kidding.
What it actually means is taking side with rebels in a civil war.
If there is any Humanterian reason, us should puch for a peace, for co-existence and pressure its allies Qatar, Suadi Arabia, Jordan, Egyption military coup leaders, …. to stop intervention in Syria.
It is the money that Qatar and Suadi’s provide for bucnch of thugs. No real Syrian citizen would agree to this kias…..
Real Syrian opposition leaders activity has been pushed aside.
Jihadists from 37 different countries are active in Syria. The only subjects they are united in is taking the endless money from Jordanian government which is being supplied by other Arab countries. It won’t be long before people of this region will become aware of what this foreign merceneries are doing to their countries and unite against whoever supported them…..and that won’t be a pleasant day for America.
Furthermore, I can not understand what the UN sampling of blood, urine and ground test is going to accomplish. Dose it mean that they want to compare it to what they have recently provided through the international arm dealer prince Bandar of Suadi Arabia versus what the Asad regime has had?
ooops, doesn’t this testing by itself show the new chemical arms shipments to the region by US allies?
The Syrian military bases have been attacked by rebels many times, is a fact nobody denies.
Even if this testing proves the traces are coming from Syrian army, there should be some concrete evidence that it is not from the rebels who have been attacking and taking over the Syrian army depots.
The way Obama is handling this situation and is pointing the finger without any doubt at the Syrian government, I take it that the decision has been made before any proof is found. We are fighting a proxy war on behalf of Israel.
UN has a long history of double talk, or being silence when it is needed to speak up and stand for truth.
The UN report will be out soon and our interpretation and outcome will be in favor of getting involved where we should not be involved at all.
We deserve all of what we have. Our tax dollar is being spent on warfare and sophisticated weapon systems to create death and destruction and suffering for others, because there is not enough of us to speak up against this injustice and this intervention.
War is not free. Look at the federal budget > income ~ $2 trillion, expenditures ~$4 trillion. We need to cut at least ~$2 trillion before starting a new war. 
What is our president proposing to pay for his wars? Anything? How many families will lose food stamps to fund this war? How many social security checks will be stopped? How many health care bills will go unpaid? How many federal employees will lose their jobs or pensions?
I’m continually impressed by the range and depth of the USC students’ opinions and by the clarity of their writing.  You are a credit to your university, your country, and your families.
I’m on the other side from Dan on this one.  Yes, it’s a horrible situation, but this does not automatically mean the US alone is responsible for reacting.  
Who can draw a circle around the result if we intervene?  Once Americans start getting captured or killed, will the war spiral out of control, and draw us in deeper?  No one can honestly answer either of these questions accurately.
Once we start bombing and killing, we are in.  The satisfaction of payback will fade when we discover that both sides of this conflict blame us for their problems.
That said, I do support the US being part of a true multi-national response via the UN, NATO, and the Arab League.  Begin war crime proceedings at the Hague.
Ida,
Was it America’s fault when Muslim hordes invaded the Buddhist enclaves of Afghanistan many centuries ago and wiped out and forcibly converted every single Buddhist in that region?
Was it America’s fault when Muslim hordes invaded northwest China many centuries ago resulting in centuries of an ebbing-and-flowing conflict in that region?
Was it America’s fault when Muslims invaded Sudan, killing millions, gang-raping with abandon and creating the worst refugee crisis witnessed since WWII?
Was It America’s fault when your prophet, Mohammed, invaded the unarmed village of Qurayza and beheaded all the men and enslaved all the women and children?  Hint:  This was 1,200 years before America existed.
………….
Ida, 
When will you quit blaming America (or anyone else) for Islam’s self-inflicted problems and start acknowledging that Islam needs more than a giant reformation before it can enter, let’s just say, the 8th century.
Ida,
You’re putting the cart before the camel.  If you want to understand the Middle East then study Islam and Mohammed – and not from a sugar-coated Islamic perspective – but from the perspective of people like Robert Spencer, Raymond Ibrahim, Ibn Warraq, and others.
Islam is a retrograde force.  It destroys people’s initiative to do better.  It quenches the potential for growth.  Even in Muslim nations blessed with vast wealth one can see this.  In Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and elsewhere one sees oppression, high unemployment, women treated as chattel, free thinkers thrown in jail.
The only way to fix the Libyas, Syrias, Afghanistans, Somalias, Sudans, Egypts of the world is to educate people about Islam.  To shout out loud about what a backwards-looking, individual-destroying, dictatorial and sadistic religion it is.
Until we do this then Syria will simply be the latest Islamic hell hole to be followed by one after another after another.  It’s not America’s fault.  It is Islam’s fault.
Your blind hatred of Islam is causing you to miss the point. America must not be involved in Syria regardless. Even if it is Islam that is the root of the problems, America can only make it worse if Obama sends our troops there.
Not to mention that your “extreme” prejudice against Islam is exactly contrary to whatever point you’re trying to prove. Hatred of Islam to show how Islam is a religion of hatred is not logical. But I digress.
Arafat;
How is it that you think you know, other’s or Ida doesn’t know as much?
You signs of extreme arrogance in your writing.
Why Islam is blamed if Moslems don’t do as good to you?
Going from detail to making general rules?
If you go back only 500-600 years, you’d see Christian Europe was deep into civil war, inquisition, with no production of science,…before renaissance,…and the Moslems were at forefront of science and technology of the time, all your theories will be proven to be false.
Islam has only one book. Quran.
This book is common in all Moslems who do not read it. This book does not allow killing except in Capital punishment and in war that is limited to self defense, not any attacks.
Moslems respect it a lot, but they don’t read it, like its critics who mostly do not read it with an open mind. They go through the lists and repeat what their ideological forefathers who didn’t read it either.
Islam is very general term, submitting to God, only one God that exist for all. All prophets, even the one’s before Mohammad were Moslems too, in Quran. Abraham, Moses, Jesus,…all were praising and following the orders of the same God in Quran.
Differences come from different interpretations in history, the part that the human being has changed.
I hope this short explanation could alleviate some of the pains and hatred that you feel about Islam.
Bombing Syrian military targets is taking side in a civil war.
We are not policemen in the world.
War mongers and profiteers of the wars promote their ideas through hateful people, like you.
Last thing we need is to make this unnecessary political war, into a religious war.
Bob,
You know so little of what you speak.
………..
The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule.  Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding.  Muslims who do not join the fight are called ‘hypocrites’ and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.
Unlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, the verses of violence in the Quran are mostly open-ended, meaning that they are not restrained by the historical context of the surrounding text.  They are part of the eternal, unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subjective as anything else in the Quran.  
The context of violent passages is more ambiguous than might be expected of a perfect book from a loving God, however this can work both ways.  Most of today’s Muslims exercise a personal choice to interpret their holy book’s call to arms according to their own moral preconceptions about justifiable violence.  Apologists cater to their preferences with tenuous arguments that gloss over historical fact and generally do not stand up to scrutiny.  Still, it is important to note that the problem is not bad people, but bad ideology.
Unfortunately, there are very few verses of tolerance and peace to abrogate or even balance out the many that call for nonbelievers to be fought and subdued until they either accept humiliation, convert to Islam, or are killed.  Muhammad’s own martial legacy – and that of his companions – along with the remarkable stress on violence found in the Quran have produced a trail of blood and tears across world history.
