The Undergraduate Student Government discussed a new commuter hub project and advocacy efforts, including making business attire more accessible to students and reviving the Trojan Food Pantry, during the senate meeting Tuesday.
In his presentation, senator Tommy Nguyen introduced his plans to create a hub for commuter students on campus that will provide them with a private space to rest and stay overnight, as well as a storage space. 
“There’s a large portion of USC students that are commuter students, and the pandemic has really redefined what it means to attend college,” Nguyen said. “A lot of students have decided to take the route of being a commuter student, and they should have the same access and rights of students who live on campus in terms of … having a space for themselves to decompress, relax and find community.” 
Nguyen met with Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs Emily Sandoval last week to discuss the project, which is modeled after UCLA’s Bruin Hub — a program created for “students with long and extreme commutes and students experiencing housing insecurity,” according to the Bruinhub website.
Nguyen said their “main priority” is to create an overnight pod space for students next semester.
Nguyen also discussed the “consulting, supportive role” USG has taken in assisting the Middle-Eastern North African Student Association in pursuing recognition as a student assembly. 
“There’s a lot of benefits to being an assembly. Funding is a big one, and also recognition on behalf of the University,” Nguyen said. “They’re absolutely an important community that we want to feel supported and acknowledged, so that’s the plan for next semester, for them to go through the recognition process and be approved.” 
Senator Hunter Hinson also provided updates on his advocacy projects, including a push to provide business attire to students in need during the fall semester. Hinson said that, although the Career Center and JC Penney offer a reduced price sale on business attire in the spring, there is no equivalent during the fall semester. 
“For students in the fall, when they’re really coming into campus and they have interviews and recruiting or other things, [the spring sale] may not necessarily be super beneficial for them,” Hinson said. “We’re trying to set up a lot of different avenues where we can address this gap in accessible and cheap business attire.” 
Hinson also mentioned the Trojan Food Pantry, which has faced “some difficulty getting up and running” following a lack of staffing and physical space. The former Trojan Food Pantry’s physical space was renovated during the pandemic, and will not be finished until 2022, Hinson said. To remedy this, Hinson is looking to implement other solutions, including reaching out to USC Hospitality to provide a long-term option for food insecure students. 
“Right now, Student Basic Needs is providing emergency meal swipes to students,” Hinson said. “I don’t think it would be a huge burden on [USC] Hospitality for them to add a few students who are food insecure and really need food assistance.” 
Hinson then discussed his actions in response to reports of sexual assault and drugging at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house and other fraternities, including attending student-led protests, holding conversations with friends and other members of USG and conducting research on sexual assault at USC and at other colleges. The Department of Public Safety reported seven incidents of sexual assault and drugging – six at Sigma Nu and one at an undisclosed location – on Oct. 20. Since then, multiple additional reports of sexual assault and drugging have been reported at other locations on and off the Row. 
Hinson encouraged meeting attendees to go to an upcoming protest led by Concerned Faculty and the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence. The protest, scheduled for 3 p.m. Thursday, will take place in front of Bovard. 
Nguyen also mentioned his desire to work on an initiative towards dismantling toxic masculinity following the reports. 
“I believe that [toxic masculinity] is very intersecting with sexual assault and sexual violence that is happening not only at USC but in college campuses and everywhere around the world,” Nguyen said. “It’s an important conversation and something that hasn’t really been discussed, and something that I really hope we can implement.” 
Chief diversity officer Kavita Rai also provided updates on her projects, including incorporating diversity, equity and inclusion questions on end of semester course evaluations and creating a centralized reporting system for the University.
“I’ve been able to meet with [Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer Christopher] Manning and have been having some really cool meetings about what centralized reporting could look like, collaborations with [Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services], so I’m really excited to get involved with that,” Rai said. 
After the presentations, the senate approved the hiring of Alexis Gosselin Escamilla, a junior majoring in communication, and Jesse Zhang, a senior majoring in biochemistry and philosophy, to the Elections Commission. 
The commission also provided updates to the Elections Code for the 2022 cycle, which begins with intent to run applications opening Nov. 19. 
At the end of the meeting, chief financial officer Adenike Makinde announced the nomination of Juliana Badra, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering and technology commercialization, for assistant director of the performing in visual arts, cultural fund and startup fund. The senate will vote on Badra’s nomination at the next meeting.

In compliance with the Los Angeles County mandate requiring proof of vaccination for indoor spaces, students will need to present their Trojan checks – which indicate a person’s vaccination status – at more USC locations. 
The mandate, in effect since Monday, requires proof of full coronavirus vaccination to enter indoor spaces including restaurants, shopping centers, movie theaters and coffee shops. Those unvaccinated because of a religious or medical exemption must show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours to enter.
Trojan Check currently indicates students who are fully vaccinated or who have tested in the last 72 hours to access indoor dining, gyms and indoor events. For people using guest status Trojan Checks, the USC Care Crew will ask for proof of vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test as well as photo identification. 
“If [the USC Care Crew] find out they are a student, they’re actually going to be turned away with that [guest pass],” said Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a student media briefing Tuesday.
Van Orman also recommends students carry a digital copy of their vaccine card when going to restaurants and other venues because of the mandate’s enforcement.
USC’s rates for flu vaccinations are steadily increasing with about 70% of faculty and 65% of students who are currently vaccinated, showing similar trends to campus vaccinations for the coronavirus.
“Similar to the COVID vaccine, there was an initial deadline and then it takes a couple of weeks to get everybody to comply with it,” Van Orman said.
The influenza shot takes about two weeks to be effective and the flu season’s start varies but usually begins around early to mid-December, Van Orman said. To combat the upcoming flu season, USC set Nov. 1 as an early vaccination deadline in hopes that students would be fully vaccinated by the time the flu hit.
According to Van Orman, the USC community is also seeing an increase in positive coronavirus cases, with numbers doubling in the last two weeks. Rates were low through early October with an average of 20 cases a week. However, the University saw a rise of 63 cases with a positivity rate close to 0.2% this week. This is similar to the rates in L.A., which has seen positive cases double and an increase in hospitalizations, Van Orman said.
Increasing rates are likely “multifactorial,” with people being together more, a change in the weather bringing people indoors and the rise and fall of coronavirus rates, which “appears to go in these two month waves,” Van Orman said.
Van Orman continues to encourage students to get coronavirus booster shots. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are encouraged to get a booster two months after their initial dose. For those who got Moderna or Pfizer, the CDC recommends a booster six months after their initial vaccination if they have underlying health conditions, work in an area that puts them at risk or live in crowded housing.
Since the start of the fall semester, fully vaccinated faculty and staff are not required to test because they are less likely to spread coronavirus than students due to their living conditions, Van Orman said. 
“It really reflects the lower incidents that we see within faculty and staff,” Van Orman said. “They aren’t really living in this community and they aren’t spreading [coronavirus] in the same ways that we know that students were because of the way in which student populations mix and are in close quarters.”
Although the Pac-12 postponed the USC football game against the University of California, Berkeley was postponed, Van Orman said she expects students to travel but hopes to get case rates down before Thanksgiving break to protect the community and students’ families. 
“I advise people who travel to … get tested 48 hours before you depart and also be alert to symptoms,” Van Orman said. “People naturally [think] ‘I don’t think it’s COVID, it’s OK,’ and then they test positive two days later, and they’ve been exposing people so just be vigilant for symptoms.”

Students gathered several rows in front of a podium Tuesday at Ronald Tutor Campus Center to listen to Representative and Los Angeles mayoral candidate Karen Bass speak about homelessness in L.A., social issues she advocated for in Congress and her aspirations as mayor of L.A.
Hosted by Trojan Democrats, the event, titled “Banter with Bass,” included more than two dozen people in attendance. 
Sydney Brown, president of Trojan Democrats, opened the event by introducing Bass as a USC alumna. During her time as a student in the School of Social Work and Keck School of Medicine, Bass worked as a frontline worker, a physician assistant and focused on combating the impact of the L.A. drug epidemic. 
Brown continued her introduction by describing Bass’ turn towards politics and how many of the issues Bass advocated for as a student are still important to her as a Congressmember.
“She was the first African American woman to be the speaker of the [California] state assembly,” Brown said. “Bass was elected to chair the Congressional Black Caucus and has since been advocating for civil rights, voting rights, women’s rights, criminal justice reform, police reform and environmental justice.”
Following the introduction by Brown, Bass began the conversation by explaining that one of the main reasons she came to speak with USC students is her belief in promoting youth activism and advocating for reforms she has spent her life working on. 
“One of my core responsibilities in life is passing the baton to the next generation. And so I feel very invested in you,” Bass said. ”I’m hoping that you’ll pick them up, and then you’ll make a similar commitment that won’t just be about your own personal advancement or wealth, but it will actually be about the commitment to try and make this place a better place.”
During the question and answer section of the event, Bass was asked what she believed was the most pressing issue in L.A., and she said it is profound income inequality. Bass stressed that the homelessness crisis in L.A. was the main reason she chose to run for mayor of the city.
“[Homelessness] is actually one of the big reasons that compelled me to say I’m not gonna run for Congress, but I want to come home [to L.A.] … because people are very angry,” Bass said. “[People] don’t understand homelessness. They’re mad at those people out there, and they feel that they’re out there because they choose to be out there and so we just need to clean it up. And cleaning it up to me means they’re going to start mass arrests.”
Bass stressed that the city should focus on long-term solutions that involve helping people who are homeless find a way to improve their situation as opposed to punishing them for their housing situation.
“There are people in this city who are working every day, helping the homeless population, getting them off the streets, getting them into housing and getting the services that they need,” Bass said. ”I want to give and raise the money for people who are doing the work every day that nobody sees, so that they can actually take the work they’re doing now to scale.”
When an audience member asked Bass whether she would defund the Los Angeles Police Department if she became mayor, Bass said no. She went on to emphasize the need to fund community programs as a more viable solution.
“30 years ago we funded communities, but then we shredded the safety net and we imposed all kinds of restrictions and laws that essentially cut what we had before,” Bass said. “When problems happen, we go to the police, and we have no problems funding and building jails … It makes a lot of sense to increase the resources to communities.”
Marco Ramirez, a freshman majoring in journalism, has followed Bass and her policies of reform since high school and attended the event in hopes of hearing her plans for reforming social issues such as justice and police reform.
“When I really started following her, she got some attention as a potential vice president for Joe Biden … and recently she just announced her run for Los Angeles Mayor,” Ramirez said. “So, I wanted to come to this to hear what she had to say about that and her main plan of tackling the homelessness issue.”
Devin Martin, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, came to the event to hear about her platform as a mayoral candidate.
“I wanted to look at the mayoral candidates and see what their plans are for the future of L.A. Homelessness was a huge issue that needs to be tackled,” Martin said. “I got to hear her stance and what her plans are; It was so great seeing her and meeting her today.”

For the first time since Mar. 7, 2020, men’s basketball played in front of a home crowd Tuesday at Galen Center. USC defeated California State University, Northridge in its season opener by a score of 89-49.
“It was just great to see people in the stands,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in a postgame press conference.
Instead cardboard cutouts and simulated crowd noise real, live Trojan fans gathered at the arena. The building shook with anticipation before the game as the team unveiled ceremonial rings and a banner from its Elite Eight run last year. 
“I think that’s a special moment,” Enfield said. “They’ll have those rings for a long time, the rest of their lives. There will be a connection between that Elite Eight team.”
USC won the opening tip against CSUN and junior forward Isaiah Mobley immediately scored USC’s first points of the season with a three from the top of the key. The building exploded as the Trojans began on a 13-4 run. 
USC’s first quarter set the tone for the rout Tuesday night. 
“It was extremely fun just to be back in Galen,” Mobley said. “It was a fun game, beginning to end. I thought we played really well. But having the Trojan family back was just extremely exciting.” 
Everything clicked for USC in the first half. The Trojans showed fans the stifling defense they displayed last year as well as a revamped, explosive offense which had everyone involved. The Trojans led 52-19 at halftime and had three players score in the double figures. 
Mobley finished with 15 points and 9 rebounds; senior forward Drew Peterson had 14 points and junior transfer guard Boogie Ellis had 20 points on 9 for 11 shooting in his USC debut. The Trojans also had 27 total bench points.
“It is nice to have that bench support because we can play big, we can play small. And if guys off the bench are productive, it certainly helps the team,” Enfield said.
Because of the lockdown defense, CSUN had nothing going offensively the entire game. The Matadors shot only 32.8%, and none of their players scored more than 10 points. USC forced 14 turnovers, leading to 8 fast break points. 
The Trojans continued last season’s dominance on the glass, out-rebounding the Matadors 40 to 25. A physical starting frontcourt with Mobley and senior forward Chevez Goodwin redshirt led to 14 total second chance points. USC beat CSUN in every single stat category, including rebounds, assists and turnovers. 
“We take every team seriously. We don’t know we’re going to blow a team out,” Enfield said. “We just played really well in the first half. I was very proud of our players [for] how they came out with intensity, shared the ball and played outstanding defense.” 
A transfer from Memphis, Ellis had an emphatic first game with USC. He started out hot with a deep three and a steal and slam which got the crowd on its feet. 
Ellis, who is from San Diego, highlighted his emotions making his debut as a Trojan.
“It was a great experience [playing at Galen]. I’m just happy to be home,” Ellis said. “It’s a real exciting team and I love playing with them … and playing here.”
Ellis also finished with 2 steals and assists, playing the scoring guard role in the backcourt with junior guard Ethan Anderson. 
All 13 scholarship players saw minutes in the victory, including freshman forwards Harrison Hornery and Kobe Johnson.   
USC will now go on the road to face Temple Saturday and build upon its dominant performance against CSUN. 
“We have really good depth this year,” Enfield said. “This is the deepest team we’ve had … We’ll play every possession like it means something, no matter how many points we’re up or down.”

No. 11 women’s soccer will begin its 2021-2022 NCAA tournament in a first round bout against Grand Canyon University Friday. The Trojans are the No. 3 seed in the tournament, and enter the match-up having finished their Pac-12 season Friday in a 3-1 loss against conference champions No. 3 UCLA. 
USC played at UCLA’s Wallis Annenberg Stadium in a match that determined the Pac-12 champion. Two goals from sophomore forward Reilyn Turner and graduate midfielder Olivia Athens within the first 23 minutes propelled the Bruins to an early advantage entering the second half. 
A strike from the penalty spot by USC’s all-time leading goalscorer senior forward Penelope Hocking, who returned as a substitute after a period on the sidelines due to an injury made it 2-1, UCLA’s graduate midfielder Marley Canales scored the third and final goal to cement thevictory and the Pac-12 title for the Bruins. 
USC’s loss in the final Pac-12 fixture ended its unbeaten run that lasted 15 matches. The Trojans began the streak after the first two losses against BYU and Pepperdine University at the start of the season. USC won all five home games during conference play. 
“[I’m] super proud of the way we bounced back after those first early losses, we had a lot of growing up to do and we had a lot to really learn,” said Head Coach Keidane McAlpine in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think we learned a lot along the way and this group showed resilience in finding ways to win games and getting better week-to-week [and] getting better throughout the year.” 
USC’s first round NCAA tournament opponent, Grand Canyon University, finished first in the Western Athletic Conference as the Western Division champions. Grand Canyon finished the conference with 23 points, three points ahead of second-place Utah Valley, while honing a 7-1-2 record. 
Grand Canyon’s sole loss of the season came against New Mexico State University in a laborious 2-1 double overtime against the Aggies. 
“Grand Canyon is good — they’re tough, we have played against their forward [Marleen Schimmer]… she transferred out of Arizona State [University],” McAlpine said. “Lot of respect for what they have done … they’re a champion, they won the regular season.” 
The Trojans remained the Pac-12 leaders for multiple fixtures before losing their last regular season matchup against the Bruins. Despite failing to clinch the title, McAlpine remains positive and looks forward to the postseason. 
“Refocus, reset, start over,” he said. “Get back to the basics of competition, learning from the championship game that we just got the chance to play. Switching our mentality and bringing that mentality into practice so we can carry that forward into the game.” 
USC bounced out of the last NCAA postseason in a penalty shootout against the University of Mississippi after drawing 2-2 in regulation time. 
The Trojans will begin their next bid Saturday against Grand Canyon University at home in the Soni McAlister Field. Kick-off is at 1 p.m.

Can you believe this semester is almost over?
Everything flew by in such a flash. From returning to in-person instruction to the seemingly endless midterms, all of it feels like it happened just yesterday. 
Of course, this doesn’t mean we are out of the woods just yet. After all, the end of classes just means that finals are coming at record speed. Unlike midterms, however, finals are usually accompanied by a period of relative calmness, where professors intentionally assign less work and allow students to study. This semester specifically, I was lucky enough to have this period span all the way until the beginning of November, giving me ample time to review the material.
Or, marathon a Netflix series.
OK, look, I understand that I might not be using this time too effectively, but cut me some slack. I’m sure everyone is also extremely tired and could use some mindless watching of a random series or two. 
If I were a psychology major, I would certainly start talking about how taking a rest every now and then is actually beneficial to your overall performance. Still, it doesn’t take a scientist to tell that procrastination is an intrinsic part of college life, whether we like it or not.
So imagine my surprise when I, mid-procrastination, found a series that actually had to do with my job? Of course, I’m talking about “Arcane.”
Now, for those of you who aren’t aware, “Arcane” is the newest endeavor by famous video game studio Riot Games, who you all might know as the people behind “League of Legends.” “Arcane” is an animated series that addresses some of the lore behind a few of the characters in their game. Currently, only its first act is out, with the rest to be released later this month. 
And it’s been a massive success. 
Sitting on top of the most-watched list in 38 countries and with a rampant social media presence, the show has already proved to be a worthwhile investment for Riot, even though it is far from its conclusion.
But, how exactly does this relate to esports?
Well, it should come as no surprise, but most esports games are not necessarily the most beginner-friendly pieces of media out there. This is especially true for a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game like League of Legends which, even though practically synonymous with the term esports, still has intricacies that are hard to follow even for gamers themselves. 
All this complexity makes it difficult for the average person to properly recognize esports as a genuine sport, let alone actively consume it. A lot of companies look at this scenario and decide to double down on serving their niche audience, usually yielding a dedicated, yet small, following.
Riot has done the opposite. For a long time, the company has tried to increase the overall perceived accessibility of its games through championships that mimic traditional sports in their grandioseness or projects that focus more on the young, Twitter-savvy audience (who could forget their K-pop inspired music group K/DA?). While they did experience massive success, a lot of those projects still shied away from approaching the general public. 
That is until Riot released “Arcane.” 
Of course, I’m not foolish enough to believe that simply watching that series is going to make people want to play “League of Legends.” In fact, I don’t think even Riot itself planned for that to be the case. What “{Arcane’s]” success does provide, however, is a higher cultural relevance and acceptance of “League of Legends.” As such, it normalizes the game, making it more likely for an average person to hold positive feelings towards it.
In other words, it makes “League of Legends” seem like something that not only nerds would enjoy. 
I know it sounds like I’m making fun of League of Legends players, but that genuinely isn’t the case. A lot of us esports fans surely have had to explain to someone how what we were watching was worthy of being called a sport. 
Riot recognizes that there is still a huge misconception of the esports scene, and projects like these are its way of diminishing them. While “Arcane” might not be the deciding factor that makes the general audience suddenly see “League of Legends” as a professional sport, it will help in making it a household name distinct from more casual, childish titles. 
Once “League of Legends” has achieved that status, it’ll be a lot easier to convince people that perhaps the original game should be taken seriously and, at the same time, can be easily enjoyed in its own way. And once you’re interested in the “League of Legends” professional scene, it is extremely easy to become a fan of esports as a whole.  
This is definitely still far off in the future. As things currently stand, the obstacles to mainstream consumption are still extremely high. But keeping in mind Riot’s track history, this change is definitely achievable. After all, Riot knows more than anyone that the darker the night, the brighter the stars.

When President Carol Folt, who holds a doctorate in ecology, assumed her position as the University’s President in 2019, it came as no surprise when the former researcher began setting ambitious goals for sustainability at USC. One of these goals transparently outlined the formation and implementation of the Sustainability 2028 Plan. 
For instance, Folt’s Instagram account features a story titled “Sustainability,” which compiles previous stories of USC’s recent eco-friendly initiatives. These measures include installing solar panels atop Galen Center, implementing multi-stream recycling bins across campus and even earning a silver star on its first national sustainability report card. 
Even though such endeavors have been impressive — even commendable — the overall sustainability efforts do not do enough, especially considering the University’s prestige. USC remains selective with the sustainability practices it wishes to highlight, keeps other issues on the backburner and barely encourages the student body to become more involved in its sustainability efforts. 
The University may have received a silver star on the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, but other universities with significantly less resources and prestige received equal or better ratings. 
The University of California system serves as a prime example: Seven out of nine UC universities received gold ratings and the other two received platinum ratings, despite having a significantly smaller budget and endowment compared to USC. For a University with an endowment of $5.9 billion — compared to the UC’s general endowment of $2.1 billion per school — USC’s efforts do not match up to its ample budget. 
Additionally, the STARS report reveals areas where the University can improve, such as waste management. The report not only indicates room for improvement but also demonstrates USC’s lack of transparency toward other environmental issues. 
More importantly, USC has done little to encourage its student body to partake in sustainable practices, which becomes apparent when considering the heavy amounts of litter scattered across the campus after game day tailgates. Just because the University hires employees to clean the campus does not take away from the discouraging fact that many Trojans display apathetic behavior toward environmental issues. 
A school supposedly filled with some of the brightest and talented students across the globe should demonstrate a higher degree of awareness for pressing issues such as climate change. The student body’s apathetic and passive response, as well as detachment from the problem is not only disappointing but an embarrassing reflection of the school. 
Once again, much of the issue boils down to USC’s degree of transparency on sustainability — being more explicit about both current endeavors, as well as gaps in execution, may be a good place for the University to start. 
These criticisms should not squash USC’s current efforts but rather push its standards as a prestigious and affluent institution, especially at the current pace of the earth’s degradation. Folt’s prioritization of sustainability is only commendable to a certain extent, and the University must raise the bar on how it deals with issues of implementing eco-friendly measures. 
With reddish-orange night skies and air quality indexes reaching levels above 100, Los Angeles gradually degrades under the looming threat of climate change; it is no longer the romanticized city of angels, but a city in desperate need of saving. Trojans must step up to fulfill this gaping but crucial role, starting with a more fervent and aggressive commitment to saving our planet. 
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that the University does not disclose trash and recycling protocols. The information has since been removed. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors

Before I came to USC, I had no desire to participate in LinkedIn because it was this mysteriously bland platform for “adults.” It was the last resort for stalking someone online when they had no other social media presence. LinkedIn was an abstraction but, before I knew it, became an obligation.
It wouldn’t take long before Marshall bros would instill in me an existential fear of “falling behind the pack,” whatever that means. Like many, I felt required to create a profile on a platform that I hardly understood. I spent days stressing over whether people could tell if my headshot was, in fact, a photo of my printed senior picture and deciding between which adjectives made my two years of experience in the restaurant industry sound like I was a CEO. 
Most of us probably don’t have anything relevant to add to a resume, and that’s perfectly fine. LinkedIn, however, weaponizes toxic business culture to make us feel like failures. 
While highly curated Instagram feeds and Snapchat stories make us compare our lives to those of our peers and compound social media’s negative impact on our mental health, LinkedIn elevates this impact to a terrifying level and somehow evades the umbrella of toxic social media scrutiny. 
In a capitalist society that emphasizes productivity above all else, success is the greatest measure of our value — LinkedIn is designed to make us feel unsuccessful. 
It would be extremely inappropriate to brag about your accomplishments to strangers or post about them on social media. On LinkedIn, however, bragging is the norm. The platform allows users to find anyone’s resume online and makes it easy to search someone’s various career positions, which may invoke envy. 
LinkedIn is so insidious because we feel guilty about our envy. As we scroll through our timelines, we see peers and strangers celebrate how they got our dream job. Consequently, we question our work ethic. 
The worst part is that we can’t even be upset about another person’s accomplishments. Unlike other platforms where we can literally and figuratively see the filters on each image, LinkedIn remains entirely objective and unfiltered, making us feel even worse about our perceived failures. 
Our culture, however, delegitimizes LinkedIn’s negative impacts while remaining critical of other social media platforms. In an interview with the Huffington Post, business coach Simone Milasas said, “Toxic productivity can make us feel like a failure if we’re not constantly ‘doing’ … you judge yourself every day for what you haven’t done, rather than looking at what you have accomplished.” 
Unfortunately, our culture of toxic productivity urges us to transform this envy into diligence so that we work harder in the future. While we should have aspirations, LinkedIn makes the road to achieving our aspirations appear impossible, especially when you are a college student whose main priority is to earn a degree. 
We applaud and encourage people to take a break from social media, but most of us can’t fathom stepping away from LinkedIn because doing so would threaten the most important part of our lives: our careers. Without them, we would have no purpose — at least, that’s what capitalism’s “rise and grind” mantra ingrains into us. In the same way that we start social media cleanses, perhaps it is time we take a LinkedIn cleanse. 
When looking at our peers’ myriad of internships, jobs, clubs and classes, it’s easy to feel like we are not doing enough. LinkedIn facilitates the visibility of these accomplishments and creates a bubble of hustlers who, through their perceived success, make us want to be among them. However, as students, we should prioritize our health and well being over pursuing an abstract concept of success. Because, regardless of what you do, someone will always be better than you on LinkedIn.

Amid sweltering bodies, the black-clad audience roared. After a long intermission of a trancelike, thumping beat, the audience at the Fonda Theatre in Hollywood was hungry — tantalized. As they waited, a sharp shrill of a guitar emitted behind the curtain. The curtain rose, and a tall, lanky body sauntered out. 
Sold-out main act, Yves Tumor, clad in a button down shirt that revealed broad shoulders stepped onto the stage. The black skirt and boots oozed of Yves’ experimental gender-defying presence. Yet, the most shocking feature was their face. It was smothered in white powder, with black lipstick smeared on their lips and eyes. Their bright green-yellow contacts, reminiscent of snake eyes, pierced the crowd like prey.
As Yves Tumor curled their hands on the mic, the discordant and bombastic song “Gospel for a New Century” boomed, shaking their heads and arms to the pleading deep vocals. The live instrumentation translated spectacularly, chaotic and apocalyptic, as the green-haired bassist played an intoxicating bass line amid Yves Tumor’s brash begging for affection.
“This ain’t by design, girl / Take it softer / You know I’m out of my mind, girl / Don’t make this harder / Come and light my fire, baby,” sang Yves Tumor. 
The energy of the audience was ignited by Yves Tumor’s pleading. The crowd was voracious, pulling and pushing itself towards the stage, sweaty bodies hurtling to the messaic figure.
Yves Tumor’s most recent album, “Heaven to a Tortured Mind,” was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of 2020. They played most of the songs on the LP, along with their latest single “Jackie” and some hits from their earlier discography.
During one of their most popular songs “Kerosene!” Yves Tumor relied on the crowd to replace Diana Gordon’s lilting crooning featured in the song with the combined shrieks and harmonies of the audience. 
“Kerosene!” a sultry and smoky song about a love so fiery it becomes flammable, enthralled the audience. They slithered and shook to the soulful bass and snare — only to combust at the orgasmic climax of the song with a sharp, swirling guitar riff. Bodies collided, merged and clashed — rubbing against each other like matches striking a matchbox.
The song then slowed down to its crystalline end. Like a priest summoning his communion, Yves Tumor raised their arm up, gesturing their right hand for the crowd to give it their all for the song’s final lyrics. Another artist would have to shout to rile up their own audience. But Yves Tumor’s commanding presence spoke for itself as the crowd obeyed.
The air was thick as they lingered on the last aching note.
“Ooh, I can be what you need / I can, oh, I can, oh, I can, oh, I can, oh, I.”
At this moment, it was unsure who the crowd crooned to for this longing. Was it for Yves Tumor? For their accompanied partners? For a heavenly crush that lingered in their minds, with whom they replaced Yves Tumor’s statuesque body?
One of the most pivotal moments of the night was “Noid.” It is one of Yves Tumor’s most politically charged songs and references police brutality alongside the discordant shrill of a violin and a hip-hop charged drum beat. 
“Sister, mother, brother, father / Have you, have you looked outside? / I’m scared for my life / They don’t trust us / I’m not part of the killing spree /A symptom, born loser, statistic.”
At the end, as the crowd chanted “911” along with Yves, police lights shined in and out on stage. This simple but dramatic touch cloaked Yves Tumor in a brief moment of vulnerability — a  reminder that even a mesmerizing figure like Yves Tumor is still susceptible to the harms of police violence.  
Despite these heavy moments, Yves never broke character. They remained an elusive and unreachable figure —except for when they entered the audience. Yves regularly came down from their luminescent pulpit to the concert floor, as if coming back down to earth. 
Yves Tumor had visited the Fonda Theatre twice before, but it was intriguing how chimerical the venue could become without changing shape. They transformed this place of regality — with gilded columns and fresco-like paintings of saints and commoners — into an arena of animalistic and passionate fury.
Screw the cordiality and tradition — the crowd seemed ignited by Yves’ experimental non-conformity. It was in this crowd where you observed immense fury and anger and adrenaline. 
I saw the intense — and, at times, disturbing — ferocity of moshes as bodies throttled and collided, some even falling.
However, in those moments of anarchy, there were still glimpses of beauty and community. Even when a mosh went so crazy that an individual fell, everyone who surrounded them quickly rushed to pick them up. Other quiet beauties emerged. Piercings shined in the lavender shimmer of the stage, lovers tightly embraced each other amid the tornado of whirling bodies.
It’s these extreme dichotomies that define Yves’ music, cacophonous, yet simplistic. Ethereal, but repulsive. Bass and harsh guitar command your attention, but place you in a transcendent trance. 
It’s these shifting facets that keep you wanting more, and also what keeps you guessing. Who truly is Yves Tumor? What lies beyond the sweeping hips and commanding, snake-eyed stare?
It’s a question that Yves Tumor left unanswered at the end of the concert. Yet, it’s this mystery that leaves you satisfied nonetheless.

Skeletosphere, an alias for junior communication major Karla Torres, is all about making her sound the perfect marriage of Y2K punk noise and the hyperpop microgenre of the future. Her new EP, “Lovetaker,” explores the confidence it takes to embrace one’s emotions and desires as a woman. 
“It’s four songs that take you through this journey of different aspects of love and revenge,” Skeletosphere said. “It’s kind of about coming to terms with … being like, ‘You know what, I’m going to take everything … I’m going to be greedy and I don’t care what I look like to you.’” 
According to Jonathan D’Aguilar, a close friend of Skeletosphere, “Lovetaker’’ can be an avenue for listeners to channel their emotions while at the same time supporting a lesser recognized division of the genre. 
“What makes her unique is what she’s doing now is a queer version of [the pop punk genre], which I feel like we don’t really get from any other artists these days authentically,” D’Aguilar said. “An incentive to  listen to it is to reverberate with those emotions that she puts out.” 
Tracks like “Boy” and “Try My Blood” demonstrate Skeletosphere’s ‘90s era grunge influence, with heavy guitar backing and angsty, sensual vocals. The final song, “Lovetaker,” highlights Skeletosphere’s voice with the addition of a guitar riff that’s reminiscent of Nirvana. 
The contributing sound mixer to the EP, senior and fellow music industry minor, January Billington, also known as Girl Online, admires Skeletosphere’s sense of originality and indifference toward what kind of music gets the most streams and her choice to instead focus on the grunge rock sound Skeletosphere aligns herself with the most. 
“I really wanted to make sure that D.I.Y, grunge-y vibe was coming through,” Girl Online said. “[Skeletosphere] really wanted it to sound kind of raw and that goes along with the lyrical quality; a lot of it is very confessional and off the cuff and the engineering of the EP is very [telling] of that.” 
As a music artist on campus, Skeletosphere said the majority of the “scene” is very pop or indie pop and reflects what is given the most attention in the media. However, she notices a reemergence of the “DIY scene.” Skeletosphere said she hopes this will help to shoot the genre into the limelight, as her inspiration draws significantly from ‘90s and early 2000s grunge bands such as Hole and Bikini Kill. 
“I especially [like] the female pop punks bands, because the whole subculture of pop punk with all the Zines and the style was really female driven,” Skeletosphere said. 
As a high school student in Northern Nevada, Skeletosphere didn’t immediately come to terms with her pop punk persona that she is most comfortable with today. Instead, the infamous SoundCloud era of the late 2010s drew interest, and as guy friends started making rap tracks on the app, the artist was inspired to pursue her own music. 
“When I was in high school, the songs that I started making were hip hop and pop because that was the most accessible kind of beats to get online,” Skeletosphere said. “From there, [I went into] dark pop, knowing all along that I really like pop punk music, but it’s kind of awkward coming out of the gate making that kind of music when it’s not really popular.” 
Despite mainly keeping her music a secret in high school and dealing with the nerves that came with her peers discovering her sound, Skeletosphere attributes Soundcloud as a big driver in her pursuit of music. 
“Soundcloud was really monumental to me getting into music because in and of itself; it’s a really DIY platform, and it’s a really big community of creative people,” Skeletosphere said. “The reason I got into [rap] artists like Wifisfuneral was because they would sample all of those pop punk bands in their songs … and I thought that was so cool because they were inspired by that music too.” 
Skeletosphere devised her unique pseudonym in middle school. She began to write poetry which then evolved to song lyrics drawing inspiration from lyric-driven artists like Lana Del Rey as she made “random things” on her iPad. “I was dramatic and young, and I wrote a short story about a world called Skeletosphere where everyone was skeletons,” Skeletosphere said. “It does sound really Soundcloud-[like] which is just like a homage in a way. I like the name, it’s very ‘in the making’.” 
Prior to her new EP, Skeletosphere released a track and adjoining music video for her song, “Bad Like Avril,” interlacing the nostalgia of the late ‘90s/early 2000s pop punk scene with the newly emerging Hyperpop scene. Reminiscent of Hole and, of course, Avril Lavigne, the music video is shot through a fish lens as Skeletosphere sings to the camera in a bedroom with poster-covered walls featuring bands like Afterhours and The Doors. 
“What’s he holding you back for, is he even worth it?” sings a mesh-clad Skeletosphere alongside kaleidoscopic visuals. 
For Skeletosphere, it’s crucial to bring light to women in pop punk and alternative genres, because, despite the resurgence of the sound, women are not viewed on the same level as men in the industry. 
“It’s still been historically divided and, hopefully, within our work that we all do with each other and the communities that are growing already, [it] all helps push this genre into more of the mainstream,” Skeletosphere said.
