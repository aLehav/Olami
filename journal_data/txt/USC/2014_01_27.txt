On Monday, Jan. 27 USC Program Board Speakers Committee and Tech L.A. Internships hosted “From an Idea to Millions: Fireside Chat with the Tinder Team.”

Six members of the Tinder staff shared their experiences in the technology and business industries. They also fielded questions from audience members in the discussion.
In just 17 months, Tinder, which was originally launched at USC, according to the Huffington Post, is now growing at a rate of 20,000 new users per day with a total of 100 million users. The company has also expanded around the world to countries such as Australia, England, Brazil and Turkey.
“We drain a lot of batteries,” said co-founder Jonathan Badeen, who is also responsible for user experience at Tinder.
CMO Justin Mateen said the average Tinder user opens the application 11 times per day, for an average of seven minutes — that’s 77 minutes per day.
As USC alumni, Mateen and co-founder Sean Rad were able to tailor their information to the student audience and their ability to relate to the student experience was appreciated by those in attendance.
“Their honesty was very refreshing and they didn’t mince their words. They actually gave realistic advice about startups,” said Andrew Seah, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism.
Rad encouraged students to take advantage of the college experience, specifically the experience granted at USC. He credits some of his USC professors as his inspiration.
“School gives you a great excuse to take all the risks in the world. The greatest asset of USC was that it gave me a platform to think freely and I didn’t have my parents or society breathing down my neck to influence me,” Rad said.
For the business majors and hopeful entrepreneurs in attendance, the Tinder staff shared some of their strongest user growth strategies.
“You need to identify social influencers in small areas, see who the influencers are, and target them,” said Whitney Wolfe, vice president of marketing. “That’s how we spread throughout college campuses and other social scenes.”
Students were very receptive to the Tinder staff’s advice. As a student with experience in business and media, Kevin Macario, a sophomore majoring in economics, said the event appealed to his academic and personal interests.
“It was great to hear how they’ve developed app, and what they plan to do with it,” Macario said. “I came to the event a little bit because of my major, but mostly because of my experience with apps. Obviously these guys are doing something right.”
Additionally, the Tinder team shared the direction they hope the company will head toward as well as their ideas for features that could be implemented in the near future.
Mateen spoke about a new function that will improve the recommendation function and increase the number of matches users receive. The team also alluded to a “revolutionary change” that will be released in two months, which will optimize the application.
“The talk was really awesome it was the best business talk I’ve been to at USC,” said April Luo, a junior majoring in computer science. “I liked how it was a smaller, more intimate environment and they were really honest and straightforward.”
In the meantime, one of Tinder’s biggest challenges is beating the stigma and stereotype that Tinder is just a “hook-up app.”
“There are people who are hesitant to join Tinder because they don’t understand what it is, but we want to associate ourselves ourselves with bigger brands and high-profile celebrities because it’s not about number of users but breaking the stigma,” Mateen said.
When asked if he would ever sell the company to Facebook, Rad gave a strong: “No.”
“We have a big vision for Tinder and we’ve only accomplished a small percent of that. We have so much room to grow,” he said.

USC Hospitality has partnered with the Mushroom Council to host the first day of the Mushroomapalooza Tour at Café 84 on Monday.

The Mushroom Council promotes and encourages consumption of fresh mushrooms. It works with many universities across the country to put on different events to appeal to students.
“We want to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits of mushrooms through Mushroomapalooza, and introduce students to how flavorful and diverse mushrooms can be,” said Mushroom Council administrator Brittany Stager.  “It’s important to include mushrooms in your daily diet because it’s a good source of very important minerals, vitamins and antioxidants.”
Café 84 was busy during the hours of Mushroomapalooza. It offered seven different mushroom dishes, from chili portabellini mushroom street tacos with shredded cabbage and soy sauza crema to mushroom risotto with crispy onions.
“Students are very excited; you can tell from the lines — they haven’t stopped since four o’clock,” Kitchen Manager Rajeendra Wanniarachchige said. “When kids see this kind of event they text their friends to let them know.”
Many students found out about the event through word of mouth.
“My friend who came here earlier texted the whole swim team in our group chat saying whoever likes mushrooms, check out Café 84 tonight,” said Dimitri Colupaev, a senior majoring in economics. “I am enjoying the menu options; the cream of mushroom soup is great.”
USC has seven other restaurants that are participating in the Mushroomapalooza Tour this week such as Seeds, Moreton Fig and Lemonade.
“We definitely want to have more events like the Mushroomapalooza,” Wanniarachchige said. “We are still in the process of investigating, but we hope to bring more farm-to-table foods that promote locally grown organic produce.”
 
I love mushrooms.

Military historian and author Victor Davis Hanson spoke at Town and Gown on Monday, charting the trend of the “savior general” throughout centuries of war, focusing on the case studies of Themistocles, Belisarius, William Tecumseh Sherman, Matthew Ridgway and David Petraeus. The lecture was followed by a Q&A session with philosophy professor Scott Soames.
Heroes · Victor Davis Hanson spoke at Town and Gown Monday evening on the miltary generals who greatly affected war and history. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
Hanson is the Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow in Residence in Classics and Military History at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He has written 18 books, including his most recent, The Savior Generals: How Five Great Commanders Saved Wars That Were Lost — From Ancient Greece to Iraq.
He outlined the careers and similarities between the generals who, through brilliant military strategy, rescued wars that would drastically change the Western world.
“What if the war is lost?” Hanson said.
He went on to reveal that the factors that traditionally won wars no longer matter. Hanson argued that manpower, technology, supply and morale become irrelevant when it is assumed that victory is out of reach. These men turned the tide of war through force of personality, intense study and a shared commonality with their troops, he said.
“Nothing is lost, no war is lost until we say it’s lost,” Hanson said.
Themistocles overcame the power of the vast Persian army at the Battle of Salamis, Belasarius re-established Byzantium under Justinian, Sherman rescued the Union and saved Lincoln’s presidency, Ridgway turned the tide of the Korean War and Gen. Petraeus outlined a new strategy for a failing conflict in Iraq that no one believed in.
All the generals worked to remind the troops of their purpose, though each ended his life underappreciated and often vindicated by his country. Hanson suggested that these brilliant leaders are needed but do not work in peacetime.
Hanson said he believes in the Thucydidean way of thought that says that human nature has remained the same through the ages so the study of the past is still relevant. He also introduced the modernist theory that through technology, humans have altered our brain chemistry so that history holds no value to study.
President C. L. Max Nikias opened the lecture, and lauded Hanson for “shedding a spotlight on the vast expanse of human history.”
“As a farmer and a classical scholar, Hanson studies how agriculture is connected to human conflict,” Nikias said.
During the Question and Answer session, Hanson criticized the hypocrisy of the government in the Iraq war and also questioned U.S. morale.
“It’s so hard to galvanize those absolute principles today,” he said. “We don’t believe in the American presence.”
Katie Kelson, a senior majoring in economics, attended the lecture because she heard a podcast featuring Hanson.
“There’s definitely a conservative bend to what he had to say,” Kelson said. “I definitely appreciate it even if I don’t agree completely.”
Marisa Tsai, a senior majoring in international relations, left the lecture highly impressed.
“I found a lot of what he had to say about these leaders really             thought-provoking,” she said.
Oh and in a case of biting the hand that feeds you, this VDH delicacy is from one of his articles LAST WEEK:
“Apart from the sciences and medicine, most of the university coarsens rather than enlightens American life.”
I didn’t attend the lecture because Victor Davis Hanson (really, you have to use three names?) is incorrect on just about every topic that comes out of his mouth. It’s ridiculous that we feted such a sloppy excuse for a historian. I only wish someone would have stood up and properly embarrassed him. If you want to see how badly he has misjudged the world of warfare, read the War Nerd’s takedown of this idiot:

Claude Pelon, a 6-foot-5, 285-lb. defensive lineman, has enrolled at USC, becoming the last of five early enrollees for the 2014-15 football season.
Pelon is transferring from Mesa Community College in Mesa, Ariz., where he recorded 52 tackles last year in addition to two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. Pelon committed to the Trojans in December and was set to enroll at USC at the beginning of this semester, but had to handle his academic affairs before transferring.
Pelon received offers from reigning national champion Florida State, Nebraska, California, Baylor, Arizona, Arizona State, Washington and a number of other schools before choosing USC. The Orlando, Fla. native said he was close to committing to Washington, where USC’s new football coach, Steve Sarkisian, used to serve as head coach. USC’s hire of Sarkisian convinced Pelon to commit to the Trojans.
Pelon will add to USC’s impressive crop of talent out of Florida. Many of the Trojans’ top players were recruited from the Sunshine State, including junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor and redshirt junior tailback Javorius Allen, who each had standout seasons last year.
Pelon’s relationship with All-American junior defensive end Leonard Williams, a Daytona, Fla. native, also reportedly influenced his decision.
Pelon will join four other early enrollees in spring practice. These include offensive lineman Jordan Austin from Claremont, Calif., quarterback Jalen Greene from Gardena, Calif., outside linebacker/defensive end Don Hill from Boise, Idaho and offensive lineman Toa Lobendahn from La Habra, Calif.
USC’s spring enrollees have typically fared well in their first seasons.
Freshman safety Su’a Cravens, who entered spring practice early last year, netted four interceptions, 53 tackles and two forced fumbles in his first season with the Trojans, earning him Freshman All-American honors.
Justin Davis’ early enrollment last year prepared him for a breakout freshman season. Before sustaining a season-ending ankle injury, the Stockton, Calif. native rushed for 361 yards and seven touchdowns, averaging 51.6 yards per game.
Of course, not all spring enrollees see the field in their freshman season. Last year’s most high-profile early enrollee was quarterback Max Browne, the Gatorade National Player of the Year out of Sammamish, Wash. Despite his accolades, Browne was left out of the quarterback race last season, but is expected to battle for the starting spot next year.
With the departure of redshirt junior defensive end George Uko and senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin, Pelon has a chance to be part of an intimidating tandem at defensive end with Williams. Hill, who has alternated between defensive end and outside linebacker, also has a shot at strengthening USC’s vaunted front seven. Meanwhile, offensive tackle  Kevin Graf’s graduation leaves a spot open for Austin or Lobendahn. Greene faces steep odds, competing with Browne and redshirt juniors Cody Kessler and Max Wittek for the starting position at quarterback.
USC begins spring practice on March 11.

As the calendar approaches February, and with conference play well underway, the USC men’s basketball team reached a milestone this past week when it notched its first Pac-12 win of the Andy Enfield regime.
The celebration was short-lived, though, as the Trojans were back to their losing ways in a loss to Stanford on Sunday, but I have to wonder if there was any real celebration in the first place.
It’s not a good thing the team had to wait until its sixth attempt at a Pac-12 victory, especially given that USC lost its first five conference games by an average of 22.4 points, including a 107-73 bludgeoning at the hands of UCLA that was particularly hard to watch.
After a solid non-conference showing that saw the team rack up nine wins against some respectable opponents, the Trojans appear to be outmatched in the Pac-12, which currently sits at No. 3 in the conference RPI rankings.
Barring a dramatic turnaround, Enfield’s first season appears destined to end without a postseason berth, which would be the third consecutive season in which the Trojans failed to appear in the NCAA Tournament. No one really expected USC to qualify for the tournament at the season’s onset, so we show some patience and give Enfield time to turn the program around.
The future looks somewhat bright for the Trojans, as Enfield has already had four commitments to the 2014 recruiting class, including the top-ranked point guard in California, Jordan McLaughlin, who chose USC over UCLA, Indiana and Kansas, among others. Joining McLaughlin next season will be three-star recruits in forwards Malik Price-Martin and Malik Marquetti, and center Jabari Craig.
The Trojans’ class currently ranks No. 30 among all schools, according to ESPN.com, and USC will also have the services of sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt and sophomore forward Darion Clark, who both transferred to USC and will be available next year after sitting out this season.
Reinhardt averaged 10.1 points per game and 29.2 minutes per game as a freshman at UNLV while shooting 35.1 percent from the 3-point line.
Clark averaged 6.2 points and 4.6 rebounds per game as a freshman at Charlotte and will, at the very least, provide depth to a thin USC frontcourt.
Though patience is being preached for the men’s team in its first year under a new coach, the same cannot be said for the USC women’s team. Under head Coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, the Women of Troy have shot up the Pac-12 standings and appear headed for their first NCAA Tournament since 2006.
After an up-and-down start to the non-conference season, the Women of Troy have found their stride in Pac-12 play. Despite its 86-59 loss at Stanford on Monday, the team currently sits in second place in the Pac-12 and has already beaten two ranked conference foes in Cal and Colorado, and nearly beat a third in Arizona State.
The Women of Troy have yet to drop a conference home game and have shown great poise in close games so far, especially in their 56-54 win over UCLA in the Pauley Pavilion.
This success has the team sitting just outside the AP Top 25 Poll, which is an accomplishment in itself, considering how mightily the team struggled last season.
The gap between the successes of the men’s and women’s team is staggering, and it’s tempting to criticize the men’s team when seeing how quickly success has come for the women.
But I believe that the Women of Troy’s early triumphs are the exception rather than the rule — we should try not to grow impatient with how the men’s team has struggled in the early going.
Both Enfield and Cooper-Dyke like to run fast-tempo offenses, and the players that Cooper-Dyke inherited might be a better fit for that system than Enfield’s. Junior guard Ariya Crook is a lightning bolt of energy and paces the Women of Troy’s attack.
Crook currently leads the team in scoring with 16.1 points per game. Enfield’s starting point guard, senior Pe’Shon Howard, on the other hand, is not as explosive athletically compared to his competition and is only in his first year with the program after transferring from Maryland, where he averaged just 3.3 points per game last season and shot 29.1 percent from the field.
Having a quick, experienced point guard is crucial to playing fast, and that is a luxury that Cooper-Dyke has that Enfield does not. Howard has been effective this season, especially considering the rushed manner in which he was forced to adapt to a new program, but might not be the type of floor general that Enfield needs for his system to work.
Next season, with McLaughlin in the fold, perhaps Enfield can take a page out of Cooper-Dyke’s book and take USC toward the top half of the Pac-12 standings.
Until then, it would be in Trojan fans’ best interest to remain invested in the men’s program, because as the women have shown this year, success can come quickly — and when you least expect it.

The USC men’s golf team is off to a strong start this spring after yesterday’s action at the Arizona Intercollegiate. The No. 24 Trojans stand in first place after the tournament’s opening 36 holes at 4-under, two strokes ahead of No. 3 Cal and well ahead of No. 16 New Mexico, which sits in third place. Brigham Young and host Arizona tied to round out the top five.

The Trojans and the Golden Bears were knotted up at 3-under going into the final 18 holes, and it appeared that Cal would pull ahead as the day came to a close. A strong finish from freshman Rico Hoey, however, and a few slip-ups from the Bears allowed the Trojans to pull ahead of their Pac-12 rival in the final few holes.
Leading the way for the Trojans was junior Anthony Paolucci, who outlasted Cal’s top-seeded player Brandon Hagy for a two-round low of 7-under.
Hoey, who claimed the team’s top seed after an impressive fall season, and senior Jeffrey Kang each added 1-over marks for the Trojans.
Paolucci got off to a blistering start, leading the pack after 18 holes with a 6-under 71. Hagy kept pace with a 2-under 69 and the pair remained well ahead of the crowd for the rest of the day.
After a disappointing 2-over 73 in the opening round, Hoey returned to form with an 1-under performance over the second 18 holes. The freshman was coming off of an impressive victory in the Gifford Collegiate last fall, a tournament in which he and Paolucci claimed the top two spots on the leaderboard.
USC and Cal figure to be battling all season in a deep Pac-12 conference. Also ranked in the top 25 are Stanford at No. 9, Washington at No. 14 and UCLA at No. 15, while Arizona State recently fell out of the rankings.
The Golden Bears, who finished last season as the top-ranked team in the country, despite losing in the NCAA semifinals, lost top player Michael Kim to the pro tour over the winter break.
Action resumes early this morning at the Sewalio Golf Club in Tucson, Ariz. Results can be followed live at golfstat.com.

In a battle of the conference’s top two teams, the Women of Troy could not overcome an ice-cold shooting game on the road against No. 4 Stanford and dropped their second game in Pac-12 play by double digits, 86-59.
Blown out · Senior forward Cassie Harberts’ 17 points weren’t nearly enough for the Women of Troy to overcome fourth-ranked Stanford. The Cardinal’s Chiney Ogwumike scored 30 points in the 27-point win. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The loss breaks the team’s four-game wining streak and ties them for second in the conference with No. 15 Arizona and No. 21 Cal.
USC (14-7, 7-2 Pac-12) struggled to put the ball in the basket throughout the game, shooting just a little over 37 percent from the field and 13 percent from behind the three-point line.
The Women of Troy played the Cardinal close until about 10 minutes into the first half, where they went scoreless for about seven minutes. USC missed 11 straight shots in that stretch, and Stanford went on a 14-0 run to open up a 37-20 lead with 4:40 remaining. This would build to a 46-28 Stanford lead at the half.
“We didn’t make our shots when we needed to, but we got outplayed by them on both ends of the floor,” USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said.
Junior guard Ariya Crook led all Women of Troy scorers with 18 points on five of 13 shooting.
Senior forward Cassie Harberts would achieve yet another milestone in her already impressive career, as she became USC’s No. 8 all-time leading scorer. She finished the game with 17 points and 6 rebounds.
USC’s struggles from the outside allowed Stanford forward and National Player of the Year candidate Chiney Ogwumike to take control of the paint and limit the Women of Troy’s ability to drive to the basket.
Ogwumike posed a problem all night for the Women of Troy, not only on defense, but also on offense, racking up a double-double with 30 points and 12 rebounds.
“She’s an excellent player,” Cooper-Dyke said. “She played a great game on both sides of the ball and made it very difficult for us on offense when she would clog the paint and double Cassie.”
The Cardinal’s (19-1, 8-0) hot shooting countered USC’s lackluster offense, as they shot nearly 51 percent for the game. The team also made seven of their 20 attempted three-pointers.
Four of Stanford’s starting five scored in double figures, in scoring in addition to one player off the bench. Lili Thompson and Amber Orrange added 12 points apiece for the Cardinal, while Mikaela Ruef dropped in 11.
“Stanford is one of the best teams in the nation and they played like it,” Cooper-Dyke said. “When you play a top team like Stanford, you gotta bring your A-game with the right level of intensity and confidence.”
Last night’s loss marks the 13th consecutive time that USC has fallen to Stanford.
The team shouldn’t hang its head too low following this tough loss, as they leave the Bay Area with a split of two conference games against ranked opponents.
USC took down Cal, ranked No. 16 at the time, 77-70, last Friday, a win that was heavily due to a career-high 34 points by Crook — the most points scored by a Trojan since 2002.
USC will return home to the Galen Center this weekend to challenge the Washington schools. The Women of Troy will take on Washington State on Friday night before facing off against Washington in a Sunday matinee.
The WOT will not be a top tier team unless they bring in players like the ones that go to the dominant
schools now. You can’t let a special player from Mater Dei go to UConn or even ucla if you want to build
a solid program that competes yearly with the best. An assistant coach from the likes of Duke, Tenn.,
Notre Dame, Stanford, Baylor, and of course UConn knows what works for these schools to be successful
season after season. They could be very helpful in recruiting, too. Hopefully Cynthia Cooper can bring in
one dominant woman who will lift this program up for other future recruits to be interested in coming to
USC to perpetuate a winning atmosphere.
Go Cardinal!
It’s great being a STANFORD CARDINAL!

Hospitality, led by front woman Amber Papini, made its debut in 2012 with a self-titled album, a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the band’s indie-darling sound that was described by many critics, including Rachael Maddux at Pitchfork, as “cardigan-rock.” The band sounds like the kid sister of the more established Belle and Sebastian, but Hospitality’s balanced execution gives the band a glimmer of promise.
‘Rockets and Jets’ · Hospitality branches out and takes on an edgier sound, while still remaining true to their indie-pop roots. The trio follows this year’s trend by adding static instrumentation to their pop tracks. – Photo courtesy of Merge Records
Trouble, Hospitality’s second album, kicks off with a determined agenda, as though the band has something to prove to its audience. At first, the sound introduces a wailing electric guitar paired with Papini’s reverb-affected howl. It quickly sinks into simplicity with unobtrusive and hardly-present instrumentation that leaves Papini’s voice floating, suspended in half-silence. The music pulses up and down like an electrocardiograph.
This style is certainly a departure from cardigan-rock and the delicate vocals featured on their first album, which were as soft, demure and inoffensive as cotton. The rock was cleaner, more likely to be played at the beach than in a dark nightclub. It was sweet and poppy, with a safe edge. This time, however, Hospitality, which has always had the tools and skillset to paint it black, gets a shade darker. With synthesizers and thumping bass to supplement its original sound, the band delves into their own unexplored territory. The trio displays a tremendous versatility; from dance to rock to lo-fi, the music strives to be — and shows that it can be — anything.
On “Rockets and Jets” and “I Miss Your Bones,” Papini’s voice is full of twang and a Chrissie Hynde-like attitude. Layering on double vocals in an electro-fog, Hospitality goes the way many musicians have this year: into a pop that’s made fuzzy by static instruments.
It all halts with the hypnotizing “Sullivan,” the album’s interlude and the song that distinguishes the album’s distinct parts. In the tune (and those that follow), the instrumentation is stripped down, sometimes tinkling in tune with Papini’s voice but hardly registering above a hum. The music heightens fleetingly when her whisper tapers off but dims just as quickly when she resumes her crooning.
The kind of trouble represented on the latter half of the album volleys between innocent coquetry and gleaming mystery. On “It’s Not Serious,” Papini channels the sweet naivety of Zooey Deschanel and delivers the same message the doe-eyed vixen gives Joseph Gordon-Levitt in (500) Days of Summer. “I don’t think I want this,” she sings about a boy who’s walked her home from a party, “So it’s not serious.” She shows her heartbreaking recklessness by still reminding him: “Tell all your girlfriends / Tell them you’ll be out all night.”
After a swelling synth track that evokes the style of the band Phantogram, Papini slinks into something more comfortable and churns out a pair of ballads that tie the album up. In each track, her voice opens against the plucking strings of a softer guitar and a timid drumbeat that picks up the pace. Both accentuate the breathiness of her voice, which sounds as though it’s caught in a cave, perpetually mid-echo.
But the album is equally about being in trouble as it is about causing it. The culprits this time are the usual suspects: love, loss and loneliness. On “I Miss Your Bones,” the melancholy mood is made almost cheery with an upbeat kick drum, but Papini sings of a lost lover: “All the stars will twinkle in the mist of the sea / The black on me will ever seem lost like abyss.”
When Hospitality bares its vulnerability, Papini’s voice cuts through the silence in the same way that admitting the truth cuts through. On the final track “Call Me After,” she sings with a sad whisper, “Will you want me after / will you want to walk me home in the dark / Or is it just the weather that just keeps me.” The way her voice echoes in the pauses, bridging the lapse in the noise, is difficult to pull off, but Papini does it with grace.
Papini carries Hospitality with a bravado of acts, the likes of Zola Jesus, MS MR and London Grammar — sultry, but sweet with a tamed power that oozes confidence. It’s a quality that always solicits a second listen.
The band makes brave efforts to be everything it isn’t while being true to what it is, but seems too afraid to fully commit. There are shining moments on Trouble, and Hospitality has certainly made new strides, however.
Did it all work? Is it convincing? The result is hard to pinpoint, but Trouble is definitely compelling.
 
Hospitality is performing at The Echo on Feb. 13, at 8:30 p.m. Tickets can be purchased on The Echo’s website. 
 
Awesome review; encouraged me to buy it and give it a spin!

Every city has its quirks, those things that make it unique. HelLA (pronounced: Hell-Lay), a new series by Los Angeles native and filmmaker Rory Uphold, captures those awkward, yet charming, “only in L.A.” moments with self-deprecating humor and charm.
“I was born and raised in L.A. and I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else, but at the same time I realize it’s completely ridiculous,” Uphold said. “It’s the best/worst place in the world and this is my love/hate letter to the city.”
The brief, two-minute episodes depict Uphold’s character (Uphold plays a fictionalized version of herself) navigating life in the city as she finds herself in hilariously awkward situations, like shopping next to a supermodel and trying to offer food to a homeless man who is a gluten-free vegan. Uphold’s show captures situations that other Angelenos might find themselves in, in a fresh and relatable way.
“I want to show little snapshots of those funny ‘f— my life’ moments that people could relate to,” Uphold said. “I really like self-deprecating humor because most people can relate and have been in similar situations before, so I was going for something like that.”
Since the first episode “Shopping in LA …” premiered this month, the series has received an enthusiastic web response. The inaugural episode became a viral hit on reddit, a social network platform focused on entertainment and news, reaching over 100,000 views in one day and prompting a lively debate on body image. After the second episode, “Dinner in West Hollywood …” garnered half a million page views, famed comedy video website Funny or Die called Uphold and asked to set up a channel for the program.
Uphold previously wrote, directed, produced and starred in Safety, a dark comedy about a one-night stand starring Ben York Jones, the co-writer of the award-winning Sundance darling Like Crazy. Safety was well-received on the festival circuit and went on to win several awards, including the prize for best screenplay at the Blue Whiskey Independent Film Festival. The success of her short film gave Uphold the confidence to create HelLA.
“I grew up in Los Angeles so I didn’t know anything different,” Uphold said. “I had these crazy experiences and I started writing them down.”
Sifting through pages of notes to construct the episodes, Uphold later narrowed down the stories based on which anecdotes were the funniest and the availability of the cast and locations. All of the episodes were shot in one week and edited in the following week. So far, Uphold has created 10 episodes and plans to release between 12 and 14 episodes.
Uphold enjoys creating web-based content because of the cheap production cost and potential to reach a wide audience.
“I think it’s easier to ask people to watch a short video than a long one and it’s a nice way to get my specific brand of humor out,” Uphold said. “I think if you can get someone to laugh in 30 seconds, they’ll stick around.”
Uphold draws inspiration from a variety of comedians. Some of her favorites include Larry David, Louis C.K., Aziz Ansari and Mindy Kaling.
“I really love Louis [C.K.]. Mindy Kaling is hilarious, I really like The Mindy Project,” Uphold said. “She’s a new voice in comedy and having diversity is pretty awesome.”
Uphold grew up in Lake Tahoe, Calif. and Hermosa Beach, Calif.,  splitting time between the beach and dance classes. She credits her upbringing in Los Angeles with allowing her many opportunities for creativity and providing her with many stories to tell, some of which appear in HelLA.
Prior to creating her web series, Uphold also acted and had a music career, even releasing an EP, Catch Me if You Can. She took her music on the road for a while, and opened for notable acts such as E-40 and Colby O’Donis. Her songs have been featured in films such as The Anniversary at Shallow Creek  and The Victim. Uphold also spent time in 2008 touring the west coast, promoting the importance of education.
Despite her budding career as a singer, Uphold decided she no longer wanted to make pop music and began to pursue filmmaking and focus on creating her own content, which eventually led to HelLA.
“Songwriting and filmmaking are similar to me because they are storytelling using different mediums,” Uphold said. “I like to focus on telling the best story. You can market something and push it out, but at the end of the day it has to be compelling.”
As far as the future goes, Uphold will be busy. She recently filmed a pilot and is setting up a Kickstarter account to finance HelLA’s second season, in addition to acting in other projects, including a science-fiction movie called The Circle.

During the third period of the National Hockey League Stadium Series last weekend, the Anaheim Ducks fans started a particularly obnoxious “Beat L.A.!” chant. True, they were ahead 2-0 in what was turning into a frustrating shutout of my beloved Los Angeles Kings, so Ducks fans had every right to go ahead and gloat. Or quack. Or whatever it is they do.
But that chant drives me crazy. You never hear people shouting “Beat O.C.!” or “Beat S.F.!” But “Beat L.A.!” has become a universal slogan for just about any sports fan rooting against a Los Angeles team. It doesn’t matter if its hockey or baseball — people love to hate Los Angeles.
I used to be one of those people. I grew up in the suburbs around Los Angeles, and when it came time to apply to college, I thought I wanted to go as far away as I could. I was burned out on the lifestyle. I would complain bitterly to my mom, an ex-New Yorker, in large blanket statements: “Everything takes an hour to get to,” “my lunch cost me more than I make babysitting,” “I can’t have a real conversation with anyone.”
Don’t get me wrong; there was a lot I loved about my life. I remember long summer days at Zuma Beach, swimming in the ocean for hours with the taste of salt water on my tongue. There were the glorious trips to In-N-Out with friends — driving down the 101 North with the windows down, radio turned up to 106.7 FM. And, of course, the ever-present sunshine that always felt like the unquestioned backdrop to my life. In fewer words, The O.C. theme song could sum it all up nicely.
But I’d also seen Gilmore Girls. I dreamed of a place that was less shallow, more welcoming. I wanted neighbors who would wave back. I wanted public transportation. I wanted snow, damn it. Yet, it wasn’t to be. To quote John Steinbeck, another disillusioned Californian, “the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” I ended up “right back where I started from,” if you will, studying print and digital journalism at USC.
Living in the heart of Los Angeles has given me a new perspective on the city, though. I can’t explain it. I still don’t understand it, completely. But somehow, the city has grown on me. Suddenly, I’m the one getting protective about it when I hear someone else make a snarky comment.
Yes, Los Angeles can feel superficial, self-absorbed and downright insufferable, at times. A lot of the clichés are real. People do take their tiny dogs with them to get nonfat lattes, every other person does work in “the industry” and some people do juice every meal before attending a yoga-Pilates-CrossFit fusion. But there is a lot more to Los Angeles than what Saturday Night Live’s “The Californians” would have you believe. There is an incredible history and tradition here to pursue what you want to pursue, love whom you want to love and be who you want to be.
We’re the second-largest city in the United States. We’re arguably the most diverse city in the country and we’re definitely a place like no other — the Stadium Series game was a perfect example of that. It marked Southern California’s first official outdoor hockey game. It was a complete spectacle, in all the best ways. On the way there, the I-5 Freeway was jammed with cars, because who takes the bus? People paid $20 to park in stadium parking. Celebrities walked the red carpet in the Dodger Dugout Club. KISS was pulled out of obscurity to perform a show that was more about pyrotechnics than vocals. People chowed down on Dodger Dogs in January as they craned their necks to see anything from their blocked vantage points in a stadium not designed for a hockey game.
Then of course, the Trojan Marching Band took the field to welcome fans to their seats. Wayne Gretzky, the great one, arrived in a smart black suit, hands in his pockets, to represent the history of hockey in Los Angeles. And who else but Vin Scully was there to say, “And now, it’s time for … NHL Hockey.”
As my dad, a native Angelino, put it as he squeezed my hand: This was science fantasy. But it wasn’t science fantasy — it was Los Angeles. Where else could all of this come together? And on a night when I wore short sleeves, no less. I can’t think of anywhere else in the world where that would be possible.
Breaking with an infamous Los Angeles tradition, most of the fans stayed the whole game. Even though an L.A. Kings win wasn’t in the cards to put the cherry on top of the night, the experience will stay with me for some time.
Haters are going to hate when it comes to Los Angeles. But I’m so glad that I live in this preposterous city.
This column is a love letter to Los Angeles and an attempt to understand it better. Because the longer I live here, the less I understand it — and the more it grows on me.

When lead singer Jason Shine placed an ad in his local paper for a bass player after moving to Los Angeles, he had no idea that the person who would respond would be Julio Montero, longtime friend and co-founder of the band they had created in Brooklyn back in 2005. Family Cave was soon born — or, rather, reborn — through what Shine calls “sheer coincidence.”

They reunited in 2011,   after Montero had started his own side project, Cuñao. The duo met up with drummer Mitch Lestner and pianist and vocalist Kristina Thoergesen, and rediscovered qualities that had once inspired Shine and Montero’s band name — a home and a feeling of belonging.
The reunion of original members coupled with the familial connection between the four gives the band a comfortable feel.
The quartet claims to put a new twist on indie rock in the context of the current music landscape, placing more of an emphasis on the power of the melody and on the story within the lyrics as they hope to demonstrate on their upcoming album.
“A lot of the music that’s out there today, as opposed to the music of the past, is less melody-driven,” Shine said. “It’s more based on simply a mood or a feeling, and a lot of the time, kind of lacks a story — that’s something that I never latched onto. For me, I’m always much more interested in a story. Not necessarily storytelling as a ballad, but having an idea of something I’m trying to say and having a beginning, middle and end.”
Shine’s focus on storytelling is an evident and important aspect of Family Cave’s originality. Their process gives each song its own unique, quirky personality. The time and energy that Family Cave puts into incorporating stories into their lyrics is evidenced by the quality of music they produce.
Shine, who teaches music theory and songwriting at Brighton Hall Prep School in Burbank, Calif.,  often attempts to tell two stories at the same time in each song — their meanings are sometimes obvious, but at times more complex.
“There’s this song — I was really kind of obsessed with Battlestar Galactica,” Shine said. “The idea is that these people create these robots of the future, that they’re trying to live forever — you wouldn’t necessarily know what it’s about, but there’s a story lying behind it that inspires the meaning of the lyrics.”
As the songwriter of the group, Shine contributes most of the lyrics and cites David Bowie as a major inspiration when writing. The instrumental scores, however, involve every member of the band.
“I teach a lot of songwriting and [Bowie] is great to teach from because the songs are so well formed,” Shine said. “As for the instrumental part, that’s the part where it’s pretty important for each person to contribute and put themselves into it. You might speed it up, you might slow it down — allow each person to develop on their own.”
The soft release of their new single, “No Sleep Tonight,” is now available to download for free on the band’s website. Shine said that what he appreciates most about the track is the fact that it is one of their most collaborative pieces.
“Of all the songs we have, it’s the most evenly split,” Shine said. “We were just kind of sitting around and each person came up with something — I came up with the riff, and someone came off of that, and someone took it home. The song is about running away from your problems. When you have a problem, the impulse is to run  away and start something fresh, and so the idea is about not doing that anymore.”
Fans are hoping that “No Sleep Tonight” foreshadows what is to come on the rest of their album. The highly anticipated album, already months past its original release date, has endless possibilities. Audiences can expect an abundance of story-telling, along with Family Cave’s traditionally demure background tracks. Hopefully, however, the band will branch into more variety as well.
In their first college campus performance, the indie rock group is set to play at Tommy’s Place tonight as part of Underground LA. Because they mostly perform for an adult audience, Shine said the band is looking forward to reaching a new demographic.
“As far as the adult nightclub crowd in Los Angeles, with a lot of band venues, it’s really sort of hit-or-miss, depending on the nights you play, the venue you play and who they put you with,” Shine said. “I’ve been to Tommy’s Place, and it’s a pretty live venue, so we’re excited to be playing for a younger audience … We’re excited to be playing at USC, which is the age of students looking for up-and-coming bands that are kind of a different sound.”
 
Family Cave will play at Tommy’s Place at 8 p.m., tonight.

Never mind college basketball — the new year marks awards show season.
During past awards seasons, I’d fill out my brackets for best actor, actress, songstress and television show hopefuls. It would be a year long study of the material and Metacritic statistics filled with disappointments and career resurges affecting my predictions. The best strategy? Pick Meryl Streep for everything. She’s first-draft.
Uniforms of these arenas are the most aesthetically pleasing — instead of jerseys and shorts, there are gowns and suits. Most importantly, the award recipients receive a shiny gold Academy Award over an NCAA plaque.
Needless to say, I heavily immerse myself in awards show culture every year. This year, however, my excitement for finding out these superlative outcomes began to diminish. Well into hosts Amy Poehler and Tina Fey’s Golden Globes monologue and the occasional shots of Leonardo DiCaprio , I realized how much I depend on award shows to guide me through material of merit. Often times, I watch movies or listen to songs simply because they win “Best Picture” or “Best Album.” Because of this, I’ve lost, or never gained, the ability to self-discern.
Because my media experiences are heavily determined by what is considered “Best” by a certain group of people, I’d watched a lot of movies that were deemed culturally significant, but I ultimately did not enjoy. Some of the most notable television shows did not have stand-out plotlines for me as I went through a Netflix binge. One particular song nominated for a Grammy Award, the most prestigious accolade in the music industry, stirred the nation, even though it was one that I considered to be downright offensive. Yet because of the weight society puts on these works of art, people are pressured to treasure them as well. It is as though society has deemed what is worthy of one’s time as solely black and white.
What many people don’t realize, however, is the subjective factor of each category. Even though winners are seemingly afforded a universal stamp of approval, the fact of the matter is that there are upsets every year. Last year, Empire released its 22 Top Oscar injustices, listing works that truly “deserved” a particular Oscar win. And when Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were omitted from the Oscar ballot this year for their honorable works in Captain Phillips and Saving Mr. Banks, The Hollywood Reporter noticed. Without concrete numbers like number of baskets made in a basketball game, the best can’t really be determined.
It is as if award shows capitalize on the celebrity of the artists rather than the art itself. Instead of focusing on an incognito performance a particular actor or actress gave, the spotlight is on the star factor of the performer themselves. Acceptance speeches become the mascot for the performance rather than letting the work reach out and speak to the audience itself. Last year, for example, Jennifer Lawrence criticized society for their prejudiced conceptions of mental illness through her performance in Silver Linings Playbook. Instead of furthering her character’s message, people buzzed about her stumble up the stairs to receive her Oscar the next day. Social media boasted that she was so down-to-earth, while countless GIFs were made of the clumsy moment. Lawrence’s character, Tiffany, got lost in Lawrence herself.
By limiting the ultimate goal to snagging the coveted golden statue, these ceremonies could spur quality creations. They could also, however, lead the ignorant to new discoveries. But for now, I’ll use award shows as a source of entertainment. I think I’ll be happier that way.
So, never mind the brackets — awards show season should not determine the best in pop culture.

Public education is an extension of the government — it should be unbiased, freely accessible and secular. Yet, public schools in South Carolina are deliberately smudging the line between education and religion by attempting to impose a daily moment of silence during which teachers can lead prayer, according to Slate.  This attempt to couple public education and religion is detrimental to students and adds unneeded pressure to teachers.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
Though the Constitution’s First Amendment allows students to pray in public spaces, schools should not allow teachers to conduct prayer. Students look to teachers as authority figures, and allowing educators to conduct a prayer service is an abuse of their authority. Teacher-led prayer will apply unnecessary pressure to non-religious students, while also compelling teachers to lead prayers that they do not necessarily believe in.
“The essential part of the bill, the important part, is putting prayer back in school,” Rep. Wendell Gilliard (D-South Carolina) told the Huffington Post. Clearly, this bill is biased in favor of religious students. Public schools are an extension of the secular state and, therefore, should not impose religious ideas on students.
The mixing of school and religion also risks associations between education and a particular religion. In addition to school-enforced prayer time, some religious organizations are taking advantage of public school schedules by using school buildings for services. Religious organizations fall under a special branch of 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And not only are these organizations tax-exempt, but they also do not have to report income to the IRS. Clearly, religious organizations are already afforded many benefits by the state and should not reap further gains by using public school buildings to conduct religious services.
In 2011’s decision for Bronx Household of Faith v. New York City Board of Education case, the United States District Court ruled that these IRS exemptions create “an unintended bias in favor of Christian religions.” Despite this decisive ruling, individual school districts are free to rent their buildings as they please. Just as there are laws guaranteeing the division between church and state, there must be national guidelines to separate education and religion.
Public schools should offer a broad perspective on education and promote religious tolerance. Almost all charter schools receive public funding and should respect the distinction between education and religion. Yet, since there are no concrete laws to enforce this separation, some public and charter schools incorporate religion in the classroom.
A common point of contention between religion and education is over Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. Creationists reject the idea of evolution and hold that the Biblical story in the Book of Genesis explains the origins of life. Even though science is constantly changing and re-evaluating itself, Darwin’s theory of evolution should not be excluded from science curriculums.
Certain schools, however, still present the origins of life in limited terms. The Responsive Education Solutions charter system in Texas uses self-published workbooks to describe biased views of evolution. These biology “Knowledge Units” cast unreasonable doubt on the validity of the fossil record and espouse Creationism, according to Slate. Though students are free to believe whichever theory fits best with their personal beliefs, schools must present the facts in an unbiased manner. By only presenting one view, schools are cheating students of information and creating a gap in their education.
Public education should provide students with critical reasoning and decision-making tools so that they can make informed choices. The goal of education is to foster a sense of natural curiosity and a love of learning, not to memorize facts or recite dogma. Learning should go beyond the textbooks, expanding students’ perspectives and introducing them to different modes of thinking and living.
As an extension of the state, public schools must focus on presenting multiple unbiased views and allow students to draw their own conclusions.

Taxpayers should be left out of public schools. Bringing taxes into public schools guarantees a political fight over education. Education is too important to allow what is being taught to be restricted by politicians and the political process. The only way to free schools from political winds is to make the users pay a fee for service. We have more resources and options for learning today than ever before. Should we keep schools chained to politics, always subject to budget battles, strikes, sick outs, and “for  the children” arguments?

It looks like most of America took cover from the polar vortex instead of trekking it to the movie theater last weekend. With only one new wide release, most films had a light to moderate drop from the robust MLK weekend.
While the weekend following any holiday weekend tends to drop off, the snowstorm and generally awful weather throughout the East Coast likely kept potential moviegoers indoors — not to mention those who stayed in to watch the Grammys on Sunday night.
The Top 5 films remained unchanged, with Ride Along repeating at number one, with a solid $21.296M for a total of $75.5M. With a lack of competition next week, expect the cop comedy to be the first 2014 release to gross over $100M. It’s surprising that a sequel hasn’t been announced (is the name Another Ride Along too on the nose?).
Lone Survivor also repeated in second place, with $12.9M and should reach over $100M by next weekend. So far, this is proving to be a great year for Universal, having accomplished the rare feat of having both the No. 1 and No. 2 films two weeks running. It makes up for 47 Ronin costing the company an estimated $175M.
Frozen actually hopped back into fourth place over Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit with $9.12M for the weekend and a fantastic $347.9M total domestically. It is now the highest grossing original animated feature ever, eclipsing Finding Nemo’s $339.71M. With a sing-along re-release due next week and a possible Oscar win in March, the Disney musical has captured widespread critical and commercial attention.
The big loser of the weekend though was the lone new release: I, Frankenstein was dead on arrival with a paltry $8.61M, which is less than half of what Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters ($19.69M) did a year ago and even less than The Legend of Hercules ($8.87M), which had a modest marketing campaign that generated less awareness.
From the producers of the Underworld franchise, the film, based on a graphic novel by Kevin Grevioux, reinterprets Mary Shelley’s classic novel as a deathly serious action thriller about a war between demons and gargoyles. Rather than telling the story of a creator and his creation, Aaron Eckhart stars as Frankenstein’s monster, reimagined as a demon-hunter.
From the first trailer, the film was unable to present anything coherent or compelling in this reinterpretation. Say what you will about the Underworld franchise, but at least there was never any confusion about what, exactly, was the core conflict. Taking the character of Frankenstein’s monster and forcing him into a battle that involves angels, demons, gargoyles and reanimated corpses makes everything more muddled.
It also didn’t help that the film seemed to take itself so seriously. Hansel & Gretel was able to get away with interpreting a fairy tale as a swashbuckling R-rated action film because it never took itself too seriously, which is why the film, despite poor reviews, has built a bit of a fanbase. Instead, I, Frankenstein took the serious tone of Underworld to near-parodic levels (Did every character need to have a graveling voice in this film?) and also fell prey to the obnoxious “sexy monster” trend that the Twilight series popularized (I’m hideous, just don’t look at my immaculate six-pack.).
Interestingly, Fox is planning their own Frankenstein for next year, with James McAvoy as Dr. Frankenstein and Daniel Radcliffe as Igor. Fortunately, it seems that film is more based in the source material, although it greatly expands the role of Igor, who was not in the book. Considering how resoundingly the public rejected this “dark and gritty” version, perhaps moviegoers will appreciate something more true to the original novel.
