Second home • A view of spring on the Bosphorus from the South Campus of Boğaziçi University. – Ida Abhari | Daily Trojan
I was asked recently to sum up my experiences studying abroad in Istanbul — a question that really has no good answer because there really is no way to sum up living in a country that is totally different from your own, and especially a place as diverse, exciting and crazy as Istanbul.
I think that for a lot of people who ask this question, they expect the answer to involve something about how exotic Istanbul is, or how it really bridges the gap between East and West or something of that nature. It’s not that these things aren’t true — it’s that there is so much more to explain. And, as my study abroad experience here was my second visit to Istanbul, I already knew a lot of what to expect.
I knew I could expect beautiful views of the Bosphorus Straits, copious amounts of tea and the feeling of being jostled and lost among the crowds in this megacity of 16 to 20 million people, depending on who you ask.
Something that has both frustrated and excited me throughout my time here is that apart from my university, many Turkish people do not speak English, or at least well enough to converse. It’s something I wanted in my study abroad experience — I wanted to be made uncomfortable. But it only really hit me during spring break, traveling through Europe with a friend studying abroad in London.
“It’s going to be really weird going back to the States and understanding everything people say around you,” I remarked, which of course, to her, was not an altogether novel experience.
It really put in perspective my small victories — finally being able to find a lint roller at a convenience store in Italy after searching in vain for one in Istanbul, for example — and realizing that sometimes, life is confusing, complicated and hard, but that’s why it’s also fun. And, if we’re going to characterize how easy countries are to navigate based on how easy it is to find a lint roller, then I’d probably rank every country I visited over spring break (Italy, the Czech Republic and Hungary) over Turkey.
And of course, there are other unexpected occurrences — such as the uncertain security situation — that I found myself attempting to reconcile with my need to regularly access “soft targets,” like the metro. It’s hard to package this aspect of my experience into a convenient graf about what I’ve learned about the world and myself by learning to deal with the sometimes twice-weekly security alerts from the U.S. Embassy, but it has certainly taught me valuable lessons about the power of fear, and why terrorism is called what it is.
This will be my final blog post, and I leave Istanbul in a little over two weeks. I can’t say I’ve always felt this way, especially during the difficult times after attacks and security warnings and email check-ins from friends and family, but I don’t want to leave, at all. Istanbul, I’ll be back — Görüşmek üzere!

I don’t know about you, but food will always be the way to my heart. Yes, I admit it. I am a foodie. My thoughts constantly revolve around everything food-related. What am I eating for dinner tonight? Wow that burrito looks really good, I wonder where it’s from. Where should I go for brunch this weekend? Sound familiar? Here are nine situations that only hard-core foodies will understand.
If you didn’t ‘gram it, did you really go to brunch?

Hungry? Yup, your whole class probably knows it too by the sound of your stomach growling during lecture. Oops!

If you don’t follow @new_fork_city, @infatuation and @foodintheair are you even a foodie?

Worth it? Absolutely.

A true foodie would never sign up for a Friday morning class because it cuts into crucial brunch time.

I’ve been talking about these tacos for twenty minutes, my bad.

We’ve all been there. Sorry, but cinnamon buns are a lot more appealing than econ.

When you’re eating breakfast, and you’re already thinking about what you’re going to eat for lunch, dinner and weekend brunch.

Food comas are arguably worse than hangovers.

If you identify with at least two of these, then you can consider yourself a foodie. If people judge, it’s probably because they wish they ate as well as you do. Take pride and embrace your inner foodie!

Over the past eight months, I have traveled far and wide to explore 11 of the most well-known donut places in Los Angeles. I often joke that this column might as well be called “How I Gained my Freshman 15,” but that makes it sound like I belong on some TLC show, and I’m not quite there yet. People have begun to associate me with my donut column, however, and often turn to me for recommendations. Without further ado, here is the final review of all of my donut adventures!
Whenever I get asked to recommend a donut place, I immediately blurt out “Bluestar Donuts!” As you can probably tell, I’m pretty passionate about this place. It’s in the heart of the trendy Abbot Kinney Boulevard, so they are a bit expensive, but it’s a price I’m willing to pay!
This place is a little bit closer to my hometown in Orange County than it is to USC, so it’s a little bit harder to access during the school year, but I guess that just means I’ll be visiting it frequently this summer! I was initially attracted to this place because of the slogan in their shop: “Donut Worry, Be Happy.” Seeing this as an “Insta-worthy” opportunity, I got a little carried away with the donut photoshoot — especially since they were decorated with everything from mini flans and cinnamon buns to Oreo crumbles.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Donut Friend is definitely a great place to have a donut in hand and a friend by your side! Cheesiness aside, this is a perfect for spicing up your donut plate because they are always changing their menu and you can even build your own donut online. I have yet to try making my own, but this is, without a doubt, one of the top places I would most like to revisit.
Located in the heart of Little Tokyo, Cafe Dulce has a relaxing ambience that will make you want to indulge in everything from ramen to boba to mini donuts! You might not usually go to Little Tokyo with the intention of getting a donut, but now, you have a reason to. 
I had a fantastic experience at Fantastic Donuts — mostly because the donuts are so adorably decorated. I usually expect donuts that focus on presentation to lack in points in the taste department, but I was happy to find that the flavors were just as tasteful as the aesthetics.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Ever since I wrote my article for this store, I’ve been referring to it as “The Donut Man AKA The Only Man I Need.” I get a kick out of saying that every time, but I’m even more satisfied when I get to eat their signature flavor — the glazed donut stuffed with strawberries.
California Donuts is perhaps the most well-known donut place in Los Angeles, and people always ask for my opinion on it. I would have to say that it is a little overrated, but you should still go at least once for the experience — and the Instagram photo, of course.
Colorado Donuts was a pretty basic donut place for the most part, but they do make the donut that I considered to be the cutest out of all the ones I tried this past year, which is the cookie monster donut — complete with a Famous Amos cookie, eyes and everything.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
If you’ve been at USC long enough, you’re familiar with Spudnuts. Because it’s open 24 hours and within walking distance of campus by the Row, most students like to come here for their late-night munchies. Interestingly enough, it seems almost taboo to go during the day since going past midnight is part of what makes it fun!
Primo’s Donuts is one of the older places I visited, and it definitely feels like a classic. Unfortunately, there wasn’t anything too special about the flavors. Because its style is so traditional, Primo’s seems to be falling behind compared to the up-and-coming trendy donut shops that have opened in recent years, so I probably wouldn’t come here again.
The quality of the donuts at Randy’s is by far my least favorite. It’s such an old establishment that their menu is not up to date with new recipes. The only reasons I would recommend going here would be 1) if you’re on your way to LAX and need a quick snack via drive-through, or 2) if you’re exploring landmarks around Los Angeles and want to see the giant donut towering over the small shop.

While my friends in the States are gearing up for finals, I’ve just returned from my mid-semester break. I keep calling it spring break, but it’s autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and most students don’t really travel to any beachy or boozy destinations during their two weeks off. My friends and I, however, used this lengthy holiday to “hop across the ditch” and visit Australia.
Australia and New Zealand are huge rivals, on the rugby field and beyond. (For the record, the New Zealand national rugby team has defeated the Australian national team in their annual tournament for the past 13 years and counting). New Zealanders actually hate that Australians sometimes try to claim famous Kiwis come from the Land Down Under. Yeah, I had no clue that Russell Crowe was actually born in New Zealand either.
It all comes down to size, though. Australia has 28 times the amount of land as New Zealand and about five times the population. That means there are five times as many people who can frequent the businesses. That means there are enough cars to warrant having more than two-lane roads. That means the cities and the economy and their world influence is bigger.
Because of that, Australia felt like America again. Auckland may be the big city in New Zealand, but it doesn’t have the noise, the crowds and the all-day, all-night, all-week bustle that larger cities in Australia and the U.S. have. I spent two weeks visiting Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, and they were familiar in that they reminded me so much of American cities. I enjoyed exploring the massive Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne, which had stalls overflowing with fresh bread, produce, meats, touristy souvenirs and UGG boot knock-offs. I liked Sydney’s sheer variety in cuisines and retail, knowing that whatever I wanted I could probably find within the city limits.
At the same time, those Australian cities were unfamiliar, too. After two months of living in Auckland, it was kind of weird to be back in a big city again. I love that wherever you are in Auckland, you’re never very far from a park or from the water. I like running into people I know whenever I’m out in town. I love that it only takes 20 minutes to get outside the city, venture 45 minutes and you’ll be in a charming beach town with no grocery store.
Some of my friends think they would have liked studying abroad in Australia more. But for me, New Zealand is exactly what I was looking for. I didn’t want some Southern Hemisphere version of the U.S. When I chose to study abroad, I wanted to go somewhere different, someplace I might never have the chance to live ever again. I wanted to see green after three years of the dusty, dry brown of Los Angeles.
Well, I got the green alright. And I got breathtaking beaches and mountains. I got to know the friendly New Zealanders and learned about the Maori culture. I hiked, camped, surfed, jumped, canyoned, swam, ran and tanned. I’m still trying to work up the courage to bungee jump.
There are six weeks left in my semester to do it. I don’t even want to think about leaving, watching Auckland’s famous Sky Tower grow smaller and smaller as the plane whisks me back to reality. It’s going to be strange when I return to the U.S. My Australian mid-semester break was an indication that when I return, I’ll probably feel a little foreign in my own country. But that means I’ve done my job as a study abroad student right.

Last weekend, I signed up to stay with a family for two nights in a delightful neighborhood nestled like a hat on top of the city’s center. Bo Kaap is a Muslim community of about 10,000 people. Each little house is painted a bright color from hot pink to mustard yellow, making it the convention center for any tourist with an Instagram.
Alya Omar | Daily Trojan
When I first decided to study abroad, I knew that homestay wasn’t going to be for me. Something about living with a mother that would fold my delicates, cook me meals and give me a kiss on the cheek as I left for school felt weird, and I decided to get my cultural fix by living in a dorm with South African roommates.
I lived in a house with my mother (who I really just called “Mom” all weekend), her lovely son and his wife and son. From the get go, I was presented with the house rules: 
My brother came into my room to chat the night I got there and we ended up talking for a long while. He was telling me about what an angel his (our?) mother was when she came in with a plate of cakes and mini pizzas, minutes after we had just arrived home from dinner. “Just in case you get hungry,” she said with a smile, and I realized that the Mom Code, the instinct that feeds this belief that your kids are always not eating enough, is a universal force. As I was falling asleep, I heard someone hollering, “Alyaaaaaa! Alyaaaaa!” from the window. I was wondering just how I became an overnight sensation in this new suburb when Mom popped her head in and informed me there was another girl, Aaliyah, with the same name down the road. Again, I took it as a sign from the universe that I was home. 
The following morning, I met with a group of girls to brainstorm programs for the young girls in the Bo Kaap community. The issue, Mishka said, was that in the shadows of this colorful Muslim community, there were daunting issues of alcoholism and substance abuse. Young girls in the neighborhood, lacking positive role models or parental guidance, were in need of programs to build self esteem and mentorship relationships. We chatted in the playground for the afternoon before going home to our respective mamas for some Cape Malay lunch. Afterwards, we got the chance to spend a day with the girls. As I sat on the merry go round as a young girl of about 10 years and 80 pounds spun it round and round, I remember thinking, “God, I’m really close to falling off of this thing.” But I eyed all of the other preteens clinging on with no problem, and resolved to Fight On through it all.

To no avail, I’m pretty sure that girl spinning the merry-go-round was literally Hulk. I flung from the merry-go-round to the ground, tumbling, barrel-roll style, four times before sticking a landing on my butt. There’s no graceful way to stand up among a group of children, pick leaves out of your hair and maintain a modicum of street cred. Nevertheless, the girls brushed me off and taught us all how to play netball, a hilarious and exciting mix between lacrosse, basketball and just running around aimlessly.
I went home to a full table of my family, their kids, their sisters and their parents. We ate and laughed until a tear almost fell into my roti. After we cleared the table, my mother said she was going to teach me how to sew. She ended up stitching me a gorgeous white dress with lace lining the bust, to wear on my birthday the following week. It was definitely the kindest gift I had ever received. 
Through this adventure, and through my semester here as a whole, I have collected family members and friends in different provinces, cities and countries. Sometimes when I’m on the bus to class, getting candy from Pick N Pay or WhatsApping a crew to get some Nando’s on Main Road, I get this rush of my future hindsight, knowing that in a few months, doing these things will not be part of my routine, but just a memory of the greatest semester of my life. I am not a South African native. No matter how much braai I eat or families I call my own, I can’t say that I’m South African. But I watched a TED Talk last week that said that a person is defined by their localities, not nationalities. No one feels a sense of kinship with the country on the passport, or the government and laws under which they live. People identify with the neighborhoods they live in, the store clerks they know and the meals they learn how to make with the people with which they surround themselves. In that sense, I am a local of Bo Kaap, of Forest Hill, of the sunny Jammie Steps at University of Cape Town. I’m home by the back bookshelf at That Place Cafe and certainly no stranger to My Sugar Confectionary, home of the most redonkulous cookie butter milkshakes in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a consequence of gaining these places as centers of my universe, there will always be a place that I miss and a place I was once lucky to know.

After 14 weeks of blogging about the end of my undergraduate career, it’s now actually the final week of my undergraduate career — a little bit of a drawn-out farewell, I know, but bear with me for one more blog post. 
I thought writing my last post would be easy. In fact, even as this past weekend came to a close I thought for sure that in the next few days I’d have some revelation about my entire college experience. I thought that I’d be able to sum it all up succinctly and make some profound, or at least somewhat entertaining, point about the last four years. 
Well on Tuesday night, I realized it would be much harder than that. After writing, erasing and completely starting over, I came to the conclusion that there’s no right or wrong way to write this post  just like there’s no right or wrong way to have spent the last four years. 
Before I left for college I remember people telling me that it would be the best four years of my life. I thought there had to be some concrete, specific way, to achieve that “best experience” that everyone was talking about. I wanted to meet my best friends, have the best time, travel to the best places, just like everyone told me I would. 
Now, with 15 days left before graduation, I know that it wasn’t about doing it the best way, or even the right way. I’m lucky enough that there have been plenty great times throughout the last four years. It’s true that I have met some of my best friends, had the best times with them and traveled to some amazing places, but I think I’d be selling my college experience short if I billed it as just “the best of the best.” 
In theory, four years of only the best would have been great, but I’ve realized that’s not what college is all about. It’s also about the mistakes, the regrets, the worsts and the low points that you eventually get yourself through. It’s those moments that have helped me learn a little bit about how to approach the next chapter of my life — a chapter that comes with even more uncertainty than leaving home for the first time to go to college. 
If the last four years were simply “the best” it would imply that you did everything right, that you have no regrets, that everything was perfect, exactly how you imagined, that you were never disappointed. In reality, for most people, it’s anything but that. Even for my friends that wanted to go to USC all their lives and are clinging to their last days as an undergraduate student, I know there are things that even they would change about the last four years. 
College is one crazy roller coaster of ups, downs and turns that you never expected, but I think that’s kind of the point. It’s like wandering around for four years without a map or directions, but when you finally do get to the finish line, you just wish you could do it all over again.

Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Sophomore Nicole Toto curls one foot under herself as she sits in the chair in her living room in Century Apartments. She tugs at the hem of her favorite shirt — a black tee with cut-off sleeves and white print reading “Queer Army” blazoned across the top. Below are three other lines of text, centered under the white logo of a soldier holding a gun.
Down with heteros.
Down with this world.
We recruit.
“I don’t really like the ‘down with heteros’ part,” Toto says, rubbing a thumb across the phrase. “Obviously being straight doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. But I like that it really shows what I’m about.”
In this room, in this shirt, Toto is comfortable.
Outside, that’s not always the case. As a bisexual young woman who doesn’t attempt to hide her identity or her opinions about LGBT issues, Toto is an active member of a marginalized community that makes up less than 5 percent of the American population. And on a campus like USC, that isn’t a recipe for feeling comfortable.
Toto describes two separate worlds at USC. One is predominantly straight and white, involved in sports and the Greek community — the “rah-rah-fight-on” type of USC students that Toto said are the most widely known as the stereotype for a Trojan.
Then there’s her world. It’s made up of everyone else — people of color, the LGBT community, the ones who might not fit the stereotypical Trojan mold. Even in that world, the LGBT community is a small percentage, and even in that world Toto’s identity isn’t always accepted. Outside, on a campus where these two worlds are forced to collide, Toto and other LGBT students often feel pushed to the side.
Which is why she lives here. Welcome to the Rainbow Floor, a half-wing of the second floor of Century Apartments that doubles as a sanctuary for 26 LGBT students each year.
The phrase “safe space” is one that is often tossed around in the multitude of discussions regarding race, gender, sexuality and marginalization, and it’s one that often causes controversy. But what it means to the members of the USC LGBT community runs much deeper than simply avoiding getting their feelings hurt.
“Everywhere else that I go in the world, people assume that I am something I’m not,” said sophomore Funkster Scerbak, one of the two RAs on the floor. “The basics of my identity — my name, my gender — are constantly under question. It’s exhausting.”
That is why Scerbak loves the Rainbow Floor. Scerbak identifies as agender, and for many people, that concept is foreign enough to warrant a barrage of questions. It’s not that they mind informing people or spreading the word. But having to explain that they don’t conform to “male” or “female” on a daily basis is a burden that is simply too much for a college student just trying to live.
It’s the same way for Toto. It’s not that USC is a particularly hostile environment, she says. She loves this school, loves her friends and professors in the music department. As a female-presenting, straight-passing woman, she honestly feels that she doesn’t stick out that much. And even if she did stand out from the norm, Toto doesn’t believe that USC would ever qualify as an “unsafe” space.
But that doesn’t mean it’s accepting.
For Scerbak and Toto, the main issue is ignorance. It’s a culmination of awkward stares, uncomfortable comments, a lack of understanding of which pronouns to use. For those who don’t understand, who don’t deal with issues of identity every day, these seem like innocent mistakes. But for people like Scerbak and Toto, every incident is a reminder that sometimes, others see them as “different” at best.
Back at the Rainbow Floor, that isn’t a question. Everyone knows each other’s pronouns and identities. They give advice about first dates, make fun of embarrassing Saturday night adventures and feel free to knock on each other’s doors at any time to request a movie night.
Sound like a typical residence hall environment? It is. But what Scerbak points out is that for those who are marginalized, that “typical environment” doesn’t really exist. For LGBT students, the feeling of “otherness” often keeps them from experiencing a full level of comfort where being not only accepted but also understood is a non-issue.
“When you feel that a whole part of you isn’t understood, that you have to correct people on your name or your gender or your pronouns, it’s this alienating feeling,” Scerbak said. “You feel like you’re not accepted, and honestly that feeling is too much. Here, everyone knows that people get them and so they can move on from it. They can stop being their label and start being people.”
For Scerbak and Toto, there’s just one problem with the Rainbow Floor — there’s just not enough space.
The Rainbow Floor is based on applications, and every year students are turned away. And those are only the upperclassmen — for freshmen, gender-neutral and LGBT-friendly options are practically nonexistent.
All new students, when applying for housing, are asked to mark their gender as male or female in order to be placed in an appropriate room. For students who don’t check either box, this is the first of many experiences of being forced into a gender that simply isn’t right. And there isn’t a way out, because freshman students are not offered gender-neutral housing.
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the transgender population makes up only 0.3 percent of the overall national population. But if that statistic is applied to USC, this would mean that somewhere around 130 of the 43,000 undergraduate and graduate students on campus could identify as transgender.
It’s not much as a percentage. But for those 130 students, finding a community where their gender identity is accepted is the most basic and vital necessity. And while the Rainbow Floor can certainly accommodate these students to a certain extent, there’s not enough room for everyone who might need it.
In the long run, these are issues that Scerbak hopes to see addressed at an administrative level regarding housing. But in the short term, their main concern is more simple — figuring out how to make the end of the semester as supportive as possible for the residents of the floor. Because for both Scerbak and Toto, this community has created something more than just a place to feel safe. It has created a community, a family.
“We all connect because of our backgrounds, but we really do become great friends,” Toto said. “That’s where the comfort and the community comes from. We’re all friends, and we’re great friends because we understand each other and respect each other at such a basic level. It’s a great community to be in.”
You are .03% of the US population.  The University has made some accommodations. 
Get the data and see what % of USC actually identify themselves in this classification and see how big of a problem you have and work on it. Without data, why waste time and resources.

Los Angeles Community Impact, a pro bono student consulting organization, held its Spring 2016 Showcase on Wednesday in the Radisson Hotel.
Two members of the LACI team gave presentations of their work done over the past 10 weeks. Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs of LA’s BEST, a nonprofit organization for students ages 5-12, Belma Johnson also gave an address during the event.
The current LACI President, Ling Zeng, a junior majoring in business administration, opened the showcase by congratulating the nine student teams working with nine different non-profit organizations over the past semester.
“LACI has had the chance to work alongside homeless centers, arts advocacy platforms, educational programs and many more organizations,” Zeng said. “We’re hoping to make a difference, one project, one semester at a time.”
Johnson then delivered the keynote speech about the importance of leading a balanced life during the late twenties, advice that he said is particularly important for LACI volunteers. He mentioned the issue of “crossing the 27 bridge,” a reference to helping people navigate the crucial time between 24 and 29, and the defining effect that these few years can have on a person’s life.
“Alexander the Great ruled the world at age 27. JD Rockefeller began building his Standard Oil empire at age 27,” Johnson said. “Kurt Cobain shot himself in the head at age 27. Aristotle began writing his great trilogy at age 27.”
Johnson also used the metaphor of the Greek gods Dionysus and Apollo to represent the choice between hedonism and pragmatism that young adults will encounter. Johnson said that LACI members embodied the best of both realms.
“The people who are going to follow me on stage … are the Apollonian-Dionysian dream team.” Johnson said. “Everyone in LACI is smart and focused and well-connected [and] talented. But they’re also generous and caring [and] socially ambitious, [like] Apollo and Dionysus.”
Two of the nine LACI student teams presented for about 15 minutes each on their projects for the semester. The first team showcased their work with LA’s BEST, the after-school program that Johnson runs, which was created to address “an alarming rise in the lack of adequate adult supervision of children during the critical hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.,” according to the program’s website.
The consulting team working alongside LA’s BEST consisted of sophomore public policy and development and economics/mathematics major Aditi Ramesh, sophomore business administration major Chase Hainsworth, freshman business administration major Kali De Cambra and freshman global health and applied mathematics major Lauren Phillips. As part of their consultations with the program, the LACI team suggested that LA’s BEST incorporate mental health treatment for K-12 students in the LAUSD area.
“LA’s BEST was created to address the alarming rise in lack of after-school supervision,” Ramesh said. “It had three main facets: communication, activities and nutrition. While they’ve never attempted a mental health project before, we wanted to add this component to their current curriculum.”
The second team worked alongside Getting Out by Going In, a group dedicated to providing materials and arranging programs within California prisons to create a more positive prison culture. Kim Nguyen, Ryan Ochoa, Yash Kamath and Raquel Buscaino formed the student consulting team that worked to set appropriate prices for GOGI products and figure out efficient methods of delivering the product.
“We looked at a couple of different avenues of research [to help GOGI],” Ochoa said. “We actually went out to prisons and surveyed about a hundred prisoners.”
As Zeng finished her term as president of LACI, she thanked LACI members for their dedication and spoke about her personal achievements during her time in the organization.
“It’s been incredible,” Zeng said. “I joined two-and-a-half years ago, and the amount of growth I’ve seen from myself and my ability to connect with the community has been phenomenal. I think above everything, LACI has provided that real-world tangible experience that my classes haven’t had the chance to do yet.”

Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the Keck hospital workers were striking Wednesday. They held a boycott. The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
Keck Hospital of USC cafeteria workers organized a boycott at the Keck School of Medicine of USC campus on Wednesday, advocating for a wage increase for food service employees.
This is not the first time that workers have voiced their issues with their treatment. In February, 900 USC Keck health care workers went on strike protesting low wages and inadequate benefits after several USC students and National Union of Healthcare Workers representatives delivered a letter to President C. L. Max Nikias notifying him about the strike and requesting his help in ending contract negotiations.
In April, contractual changes for improved wages and benefits were made for 800 of the workers, but did not extend to the 100 or so cafeteria workers employed by Sodexo, a food services contracting company based in France. Sodexo is a large multinational corporation that functions in 80 different countries worldwide, and over 420,000 employees in total.
“We do not employ the workers. An outside company, Sodexo, does,” the University responded when asked for comment about the Wednesday boycott.
Yet, some of the workers do not believe that outsourcing management to Sodexo is a viable excuse for subpar contractual conditions.
Sandra Maldonado, a USC dietary worker, echoed the sentiment in the January NUHW press release.
“USC tries to hide behind the Sodexo contract to insulate itself from the consequences of Sodexo’s poverty wages,” Maldonado said. “But the University has a duty to make sure that its contractors are behaving honorably and treating the workers with respect. Sodexo fails on both counts.”
In the same press release, President of the NUHW Sal Rosselli recalled instances of USC workers relying on government assistance. Rosselli criticized the University for the lack of action.
“It’s unconscionable that one of the richest universities in the state forces some of its most dedicated employees to rely on public assistance,” Rosselli said in the press release. “It’s disrespectful to the workers and it’s unfair to taxpayers.”
