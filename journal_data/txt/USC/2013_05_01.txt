The Norman Lear Center’s Media Impact Project received $3.25 million in grants Monday to fund a cutting-edge research study aimed at measuring the influence of social media and understanding the audience draw.
“People are analyzing their work by looking at counting page views, likes on Facebook, followers on twitter, retweets, etc. [and] trying to figure out if their film or their television show or their opinion piece or any kind of journalism actually made an impact,” said Adam Rogers, the Norman Lear Center’s project specialist. “Those measurements show how many people saw something or looked at something, but that’s not the same as the outcome or the impact. [What] we are doing is going to take this to the next level to actually look at the engagement and the impact statistics as well.”
The funds for this research, which come from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, will be distributed over the next two and a half years as specialists from different disciplines come together to contribute to the investigation.
These specialists include Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering Carl Kesselman, Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism lecturer Dana Chinn and Norman Lear Center Managing Director and Director of Research Johanna Blakley.
“When we get these people together from across disciplines to really look at the issue of the media in a way that nobody has looked at it in the same way before,” Rogers said. “Hopefully we can get lots of students involved from across different disciplines of the entire university.”
Rogers said the Media Impact Project distinguishes Annenberg as an institution at the forefront of research on an international level.
“This particular project we are kind of setting up as the global hub for this type of metric analysis, and its really doing something that nobody else is doing well,” Rogers said.
Max Schwartz, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said this project will not only have a huge impact on the school as a whole, but the professional careers of its students.
“It sets [our school] apart because it allows us to go deeper than just content,” Schwartz said. “It allows us to see what the content leads to and the impact of the content, which is something that will make us. I think that, ultimately, that will be part of the future of our profession.”
Though the project is still in its early stages, Rogers said this only adds to the excitement for the possible opportunities for the students and the school.
“The first step will be identifying interested student workers who can come in and work on our social media and our engagement in helping indentify the types of projects that are out there to work with,” Rogers said. “Any students who have experience and want to gain experience in the type of statistical analysis that we are doing that is cutting edge that nobody else is doing. This will be an incredible opportunity for them to gain that experience.”
If you can taunt your opponents, play against your friends on the other side of the country and
play in a poker league then you can see why online poker is popular.
Although many prefer pit games like Black Jack and Roulette,
I have always preferred opportunities that offer a reasonable rate of
return. This is due to the reason, that letting you win will make you come back for more than just cheating you for once and losing the
business.

Though finals loom as obstacles between now and summer, Ground Zero Performance Café has the perfect solution for both cooling down and serving your study needs with its creative shakes and zero-distraction study environment during finals.
Shakin’ it up · Sarah Smith, a junior majoring in human biology, serves a couple of Ground Zero milkshakes to a customer. These milkshakes, which are given creative names such as “Hunk of Burning Love” and “Go To Sleep, Grandma,” are just one of the reasons that people return to the coffeehouse.– Tanaya Ghosh | Daily Trojan
Tucked away behind Marks Residential Hall on the Exposition Boulevard side of campus, Ground Zero can be hard to find for first-timers. However, the performance cafe is truly a hidden gem that’s worth the trouble of seeking out because chances are that once you do, you’ll want to keep coming back — whether it be for a frosty blended treat or some quiet time to ramp up your productivity.
The entirely student-run coffeehouse has an artistic, laid-back vibe and quite a history. Originally, Ground Zero used to be a dining hall. Students protested shutting the space down as the university expanded, and some finally took it over, turning it into a small cafe run by themselves. Even though the space has gone through a series of changes and upgrades since then, the creative ambition amongst the  Ground Zero staff can be felt to this day.
Many big names, such as Destiny’s Child, have graced the Ground Zero stage before they became famous. The cafe’s wall of autographed band T-shirts signals a history of past performers like the Plain White T’s, The 88, Quietdrive and Minus the Bear.
Today, the chalk menu board art and quirky shake names such as The Dirty Diaper grab your attention as soon as you walk in. New names are decided when students drop change into competing tip jars.
It helps that the milkshakes are delicious too. And want to know a little-known secret? You can order any seasonal shake, even if Christmas was five months ago. So, without further ado, here are the top-five off-the-menu milkshakes at GZ, in no particular order:
 
1. Bomb.com — An indulgent mix of chocolate, Oreos and coffee
2. Absent Father — A distinct and delicious blend of desert pear, Oreos and chocolate powder
3. Apple Pie — A comforting blend of sparkling apple cider, cinnamon, cookies and caramel
4. Choreo — A unique pairing of chai and Oreos
5. The Draco — A refreshing combination of Oreos, green mint and white chocolate
 
If that wasn’t enough reason to check out this creative cafe right on campus, Ground Zero is doing its part to be green, too, with biodegradable cups.
Before you know it, you’ll be addicted to its shakes and the atmosphere. The cafe even has a calendar of events you can check out on its website and Twitter. In addition, if you want to take a little Ground Zero home with you, you can stream its music anywhere by searching “Ground Zero Barista’s Playlist” on Spotify.
There you have it, more than enough reasons to go out of your way to seek out this hidden gem right on campus — during finals when they create a no-distraction haven, or any other time of year when it’s jam-packed with programming. If you’re a regular, you might want to try one of the secret shakes next time you go. New or old, the GZ staff will make you feel right at home.

Before Disney’s Peter, Wendy, John and Michael flew over “poor Nana” toward Big Ben and continued to the second star to the right and straight on ’till morning, J.M. Barrie told the story of a young girl grappling with having to grow up much earlier than most. The Blank Theater in Hollywood is currently showing Peter Pan: The Boy Who Hated Mothers, adapted by Michael Lluberes and directed by Michael Matthews, a play that stays much more true to Barrie’s original telling of Peter and Wendy.
Re-imagination · Michael Llubete’s adaptation brings out a new side of Peter Pan by giving it a more realistic, even lustful makeover. – Courtesy of Mary Ann Williams
Darker themes rest under the surface of this play, unlike in the simplistic Disney rendition, giving a quality of reality to a play filled with imagination, flying boys, ticking crocodiles and bloodthirsty pirates. As is made obvious by the title, mothers are a pivotal theme; however, saying Peter hates mothers is ironic, for his feelings are much more complex and tormented.
To Wendy’s astonishment, Peter definitively says he has no mother. We later learn that Peter’s mother actually forgets about him after he goes to Neverland. He returns home to find his window locked and another boy in his bed. Speaking of the lost boys, Peter says they are children whose mothers do not want them or miss them upon their departures. When Wendy lands in Neverland, she immediately becomes the “mother” of the lost boys and Peter.
Liza Burns embodies the complex role of Wendy with finesse and ease. While remaining child-like in her intonation, movements and wardrobe (a cotton nightdress and her hair in a ponytail and bow), Burns lets Wendy’s intelligence show through in her explaining to Peter facts about life, her motherly instincts when stitching Peter’s shadow back on and her empathy for her own mother. Skillfully, Burns, with the help of Lluberes and Matthews, embodies this dichotomy of child and adult — while always remaining true to the fact that her character is simply a young girl.
Captain Hook, one of literature’s most infamous villains, is perhaps the most fascinating and complex of the characters in this play because of Trisha LaFache, the portrayer of Hook. While the actor is female, her gender neither takes away from Hook’s depraved manner nor from the character’s lust for the death of Peter Pan. Watching LaFache perform makes it almost impossible to believe that Hook’s words were once merely a script, for she brings vitality and insanity to the character through her tonal fluctuations, hand gestures and facial expressions. Hook’s transitions from crazed rants to immediate silence and long pauses followed by slower, more methodical speech, illustrates the torment and turmoil within Hook’s psychosis. Knowing that his end is always around the corner (thanks to the ticking clock inside the crocodile), Hook manifests a fear of death that is present in us all and one that ties directly back to the theme of infinite childhood and the ultimate implications of growing up.
Though the theater cannot accommodate more than about 30 audience members, the actors’ talents and presence can captivate an audience five times this size. With a stage no bigger than a bedroom, the cast size is limited to about 10. The production company efficiently and ingeniously solves this dilemma: Tinkerbell is merely a glowing ball on a string, and the three lost boys are also Captain Hook’s crew and sundry other. Though this proves confusing at first, the audience quickly catches on to the switch thanks to the actors’ abilities to transition while remaining true to the individual characters they are portraying.
Similar to LaFache, Amy Lawhorn never lets her gender become a source of distraction or confusion. Though she plays Nibs, a traditionally male role, she fully embodies the part.
By not casting according to the characters’ gender, the play in itself becomes more universal, more relatable to the audience.  Assuming that only a man would want Peter Pan dead creates a confined and typified image of a villain; however, with a female in this role, the thought that Hook could be anyone, that evil resides in everyone, as does the fear of death, creates a profound impact.
Mary Hamrick, the set designer for Peter Pan, superbly incorporates props into the permanent set; hanging on the walls of the stage are numerous shelves and cupboards that housed various knickknacks, such as the orb of Tinkerbelle or string on which other props would hang. There is a gas lamp hanging on the wall that is used in the London nursery, hung back upon the wall, and then is taken down and used in Neverland. This setup allows transitions to be made seamlessly, costumes to be changed in moments, and yet never confuses audience members or draw their attention away from the action at hand. Small details such as these exemplify the talent and experience of the crew, which mimics that of the cast.
Eventually, Wendy, John and the lost boys return to London and the play takes audiences years ahead, showing them as content, average adults. Peter, on the other hand, is left in Neverland, with no Captain Hook for a nemesis, no lost boys and no Wendy; him forgetting Wendy proves heart-wrenching. Pity at first is sent to Wendy, but as she gets older and forges her own life, the pity finds its rightful home in Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up, the boy who never faced the world, the boy who remained alone for the rest of his days.
For while being a child is magical, it also is ephemeral. All children must grow up. The world awaits them.

The title of Georgia-based indie outfit Deerhunter’s sixth full length LP, Monomania, was borne as a reflection of frontman Bradford Cox’s obsessive traits, specifically in regards to music: in a 2011 interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Cox stated “I guess my time as a musician has gone by so fast that I realized that I have no personal life. The other guys in Deerhunter, they all found things. And I just have monomania. I always will. I’m obsessive about one thing, that there’s one thing that’s going to make me happy and it’s making music, or there’s one thing that’s going to make me happy and it’s this person”. Certainly Cox’s self-prescribed case of monomania has helped cement his projects–Deerhunter and solo-project, Atlas Sound–into what many may argue are the most entertaining, vividly imaginative and wildly successful indie rock groups of the past ten years.
Deerhunter has surely traveled a long and windy road since the 2005 release of Turn It Up, Faggot and Monomania sees a bit of a shift in sonic aesthetic. A departure from the dream pop-y shoegaze sound of 2010’s fantastically lavish Halcyon Digest, this album shows the group exploring a grittier, noisier side. Despite it being decidedly absent of Digest’s pop sensibilities, Monomania is indeed progression: steeped in a well-rounded yet rough garage rock style, Cox’s distorted vocals are mixed very high above the instrumentation allow him to flex his deft abilities as a highly sensitive and intellectually introspective lyricist. Many tracks on the album are successful, catchy anthemic indie rock pieces–however, when juxtaposed with Halcyon Digest, Monomania at times appears decidedly lackluster and at its worst, leaves a listener longing for Digest’s sweeter taste.
The opening track, ‘Neon Junkyard’, has a catchy vocal track that is accompanied by the constant presence of Cox’s strange and oddly-psychedelic and distorted throat growling. The aforementioned track, along with the following song, ‘Leather Jacket II’, are aggressive installations to the Deerhunter catalogue whose thumping bass and fuzzy guitars appear as odes to their earlier releases. A return to form is found in the toned down ‘The Missing’, a great track in that it feels like a natural progression from Digest contrasted immediately by the fourth track ‘Pensacola’, which reads more as a 60’s roadtrip blues anthem. ‘Dream Captain’ sonically bleeds its 70’s influence , the vocals even going as far to borrow from Queen’s magnum opus, Bohemian Rhapsody for a chorus of: “I’m a poor boy from a poor family”. ‘Blue Agent’is  far more toned down than the album’s opening tracks, seeped with attitude as the former sees Cox singing over a funky guitar riff “If you ever need to talk/I won’t be around/If you ever need to fight for life/I’ll make no sound” and “I’m a blue light, I’m a crippled coward/Shining out in the night”. ‘THM’ is a mellow track with wonderfully poppy sensibilities and a great melodic hook, only hindered slightly by the ear assault that is Cox’s sporadic vocal track. ‘Sleepwalking’ is a fittingly atmospheric track; a reverb-soaked guitar line makes this a thoroughly modern indie track. ‘Back to the Middle’ is a blissfully self-loathing super fun dance track–enough said. ‘Monomania’ is mobilized as the apotheosis of the album’s distorted punk-y aesthetic, with the latter portion of the song culminating in an almost 2 minute sequence of Cox’s distorted chanting of “mono, monomania”.
Monomania is, to say the least, a schizophrenic album: part loudly, distorted noise rock, part mellow indie pop, with the toned down moments clashing at times with the bolder and louder ones. Despite a few moments which could be misunderstood as lackluster, Deerhunter’s latest cacophonous release ultimately comes across as bold and impressive. Influences from glam artists like Bowie meld successfully with the fuzzy noise produced by the late 70s and 80s. Their self-ascribed ‘ambient punk’ is seemingly less applicable with Deerhunter’s latest release. The album’s minor misgivings are eclipsed wholly by its outstanding moments. Make no mistake, Deerhunter still has it and I, for one, certainly hope that Bradford’s monomania continues.
Monomania is officially released on May 7, but can be streamed online  on the Exclaim! and NPR websites.

With summer approaching, many sun-loving Angelenos will flock to the beach or frolic in the park. But once the heat gets to be too much, art museums and galleries prove to be a viable alternative to escape the rising temperature and also stay entertained — sometimes for free.
Over the new few months of summer vacation, consider ducking into your nearest art locale for some seriously interesting shows and as an alternative way to take a break from all that tanning.
James Turrell — LACMA
For starters, how about a museum show that’s anything but just a museum show? You know, the kind that makes you ask those deep, dark questions in life? Even if it doesn’t get that introspective, your experience with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s James Turrell: A Retrospective will still likely top your list of best museum shows. The exhibition recognizes Turrell, a native Angeleno known mostly for his work with light.
Expect drawings and even some pieces with holograms — all topped off by Light Reignfall, which requires one person at a time to lay down on a sliding surface that eases them into a spherical enclosure. For 15 minutes, light surrounds the viewer, creating a unique visual experience.
If that sounds awesome beyond your wildest dreams, make sure to reserve tickets online early. The retrospective opens May 26 and runs until April 6, 2014. LACMA is located on 5905 Wilshire Blvd.
Terry O’Neill — Mouche Gallery
For its exhibition on photographer Roger Ballen and his work with oddball hip-hop group Die Antwoord (their freaky good “I FINK U FREEKY” video, as a matter of fact), Mouche Gallery transformed its entire space and served tequila and champagne in a room filled with Ballen’s work — including black rats, pigeons and doves to set the tone.
Judging by that dedication to a theme, the gallery’s next show will also prove memorable; this time, the locale will focus on photographer Terry O’Neill, known for taking snapshots of anyone famous ranging from Winston Churchill to Audrey Hepburn. Not to mention, every James Bond.
The public reception takes place June 20 and is worth the visit, as the gallery also resides dangerously close to Rodeo Drive (shopaholics, unite). The show runs until July 5, so there’s plenty of time to check out fantastic work made up of plenty of familiar faces. Mouche Gallery is located on 340 N. Beverly Drive.
John Park and Skount — C.A.V.E. Gallery
If you yearn for something different, maybe something a little trippy, Los Angeles provides plenty such shows no matter the season. Explore the exciting styles of artists John Park and Skount, both of whom know how to craft large-scale visually stunning pieces with distinct looks.
Park’s people, animals and places burst with color and sometimes feel as if they’re ripped out of the pages of a strange children’s book. Expect dreamy cityscapes, girls with extra eyes and a feeling that you’ve been to this made-up land in the past, somehow.
Skount gets equally whimsical with detailed works that transform even the dullest of concrete walls into a dynamic setting for a fairy tale-esque vignette. The artist excels at creating movement on a surface with his unique, oddly dressed characters. Head to the opening reception of their show in the trendy Abbot Kinney area at C.A.V.E. Gallery on June 29, where you can sip free drinks in an outdoor area while discussing the true meaning of art. C.A.V.E. Gallery is located on 1108 Abbot Kinney Blvd., in Venice, Calif.
Never Built — Architecture and Design Museum (A+D)
Though Los Angeles has plenty of impressive architectural sights, it’s worth a visit to A+D to check out Never Built: Los Angeles, a reflection on buildings that were — you guessed it — never built in Los Angeles. Geek out on architecture drawings — actual hand drawings, not software concoctions — blueprints and models of buildings that might’ve been part of the city today but, for one reason or another, just did not make the cut. It’s the type of show that asks what we can do differently today for those budding architects with plenty of innovative ideas.
The show’s reception is on Saturday, July 27, but it requires tickets (that are soon to go on sale at an unannounced date), so you can always swing by from July 28 to September 29. A + D Architecture and Design Museum is located on 6032 Wilshire Blvd.
Keep an eye out for the openings, as they sprout up sporadically when a gallery gets a good idea or when an artist creates something new. Like L.A.’s gallery Facebook pages to stay updated with new shows and pick up advertising postcards at the galleries you visit.
And a tip to the wise: If you find openings near each other in the Downtown or Culver City areas, you can save stress on finding parking, indulge in plenty of free beer or wine and discover tons of great new artists in one swoop.

We’ve finally reached that point. Now that classes are winding down, USC students are scheduling study sessions and negotiating internships and research plans, all in the hopes of acing their finals and relaxing into an enjoyable but productive summer.
But the nagging question remains: What happens after senior year?
Though it’s easy to imagine landing a dream job or gaining admittance to a top graduate program, scary thoughts of failure and post-collegiate disappointment linger on the peripheries of our minds, particularly in the wake of recent economic recessions and statistics touting the diminishing worth of the bachelor’s degree.
Suddenly, Dr. Seuss’ claim, “Oh, the places you’ll go!” seems inapplicable to our lives.
Still, literature provides one of the best avenues for exploring life after college. Whether characters in their 20s are experiencing the nuances of early marriage in Erich Segal’s Love Story or developing their self-images in Meg Cabot’s Size 12 Is Not Fat, they are inevitably handling the deep-rooted issues fueled by undergraduate life. And despite the varying genres and styles of these novels, they give readers a taste of “the real world” — on printed pages, at least.
What’s interesting about this, however, is how much that view of “the real world” has changed. Even within the last 50 years, our marital and career expectations have shifted significantly, which ultimately affects the way we want to spend our 20s. Now, it’s less common to rush down the aisle with our college sweethearts or give up on our dream careers in favor of starting a family. And with new options afforded by delays in getting married and greater career opportunities, the years we spend in our 20s are left in a state of limbo.
Just take a look at how much literature has changed since Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813. In one of the most popular pieces of classic literature, Austen weaves a tale of romance and societal expectations,, ultimately building an emotionally-driven narrative. When the headstrong Elizabeth Bennet denies Mr. Darcy’s marriage proposal because of her less-than-admiring first impression of him, she must confront her own desires about class and romance before she can arrive at what’s best for her own future. Despite the tension-ridden love story between Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam Darcy, the reader never questions whether or not they’ll get married by the novel’s end. Though Elizabeth certainly demonstrates her wit and intelligence throughout the novel, her path, though perhaps not straight and narrow, is more clearly laid out for her than for characters in later works.
Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar, which was published in 1963, serves as another marker. Unlike Pride and Prejudice, in which Elizabeth’s expectations of romance are laid bare, protagonist Esther Greenwood struggles with her disappointing prospects as a writer and her conflicted attitudes toward gender roles and marriage. Though the society around her expects her to remain a virgin until marriage, Esther would much rather use her 20s as a time of sexual liberation and uninhibited self-exploration. Her inability to do so fully, however, leads to the melancholia and depression that has stylistically defined the novel. Here, Esther’s life goals are not as clearly laid out as Elizabeth’s.
Now, readers have the likes of Jeffrey Eugenides’ 2011 novel The Marriage Plot, which directly handles changing attitudes toward marriage, careers and 20-something goals in contemporary society. Additionally, it also handles the way these changed attitudes have impacted literature.
“In Saunders’s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance,” writes Eugenides. “In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage. Sexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.”
The Marriage Plot, true to the concerns it expresses, has almost no plot at all. Instead, it handles the emotional development of its characters and forges a new narrative out of the contemporary ambiguities of 20-something life. The novel follows Eugenides’ three protagonists — Madeleine (the graduate school hopeful), Leonard (the scientific career man) and Mitch (the self-explorer) — in the difficult year following their graduation. And, needless to say, almost nothing goes according to their undergraduate plans.
But it’s important to remember, cliched as it might sound, that there is so much possibility after college. Our 20-something years will inevitably be full of heartbreak, self-discovery and, yes, even the memories we’ll later share with our kids, and Eugenides’ The Marriage Plot illustrates this. Even though the novel tries to reconcile old expectations with newer ones, it ultimately harbors hope for its characters:
“Though at this moment she felt abused, abandoned, and ashamed of herself, Madeleine knew that she was still young, that she had her whole life ahead of her — a life in which, if she persevered, she might do something special — and that part of persevering meant getting past moments just like this one, when people made you feel small, unlovable, and took away your confidence.”
Though Madeleine’s expectations for her own life change and are undefined, she’s excited for what’s coming her way. As we think about what our 20s hold for us and the places we’ll go, we should be similarly optimistic.
Sure, we might find that our romantic relationships haven’t gone the way we wanted or that our career plans have gone awry. But the beauty in being young is the ability to make mistakes on the way to finding ourselves.
So as you prepare to head off to commencement, or just keep refining your post-collegiate plans, remember that it’s OK not to know what’s coming next. What is most important, as Eugenides says, is that “education [has] finally led [us] out into life.”

One by one, the bodies fall.
Standing up · Jennifer Campbell, playing the role of community organizer Chris Mack, addresses a small crowd at a rehearsal of the Los Angeles Poverty Department’s new project The Biggest Recovery Community Anywhere. The LAPD will perform at the Skid Row edition of film fest Reel Recovery. – Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
Some of them settle slowly to the carpet, inch by inch, evoking the collapse of a tired beast. Others drop more suddenly, their limbs casting jagged shadows on the walls as they tumble in spurts, lurching back and forth and side to side. One even gargles a lonely moan as he shields his eyes from the light.
A woman gently enters and examines the scene, tiptoeing over bodies, and addresses the small audience in front of her.
“This is the elephant graveyard. The place where elephants go and just lie down and die,” she says, eyes scanning the limp figures around her. “The elephant graveyard — Skid Row. Where people go to lay down and die. That’s hopelessness.”
A few voices in the crowd murmur sounds of understanding. Others nod in agreement.
Right outside, on the intersection of 6th and San Pedro streets, dozens of Skid Row denizens rustle about, yelling trash talk across the road, sharing food, throwing dice, cracking jokes. But in the Church of the Nazarene, the 13 members of the Los Angeles Poverty Department dutifully run scene after scene of their project, The Biggest Recovery Community Anywhere, in preparation for their upcoming weekend performances.
The Los Angeles Poverty Department (the other LAPD), founded in 1985 by director John Malpede, was the first theater and arts program made for and by homeless people from the Skid Row community. The group garnered attention for its innovative and emotional performances and projects.
Now, they’re collaborating with Writers In Treatment, a nonprofit that produces works from writers in recovery from addiction. The partnership has led to a Skid Row edition of REEL Recovery, a national film festival produced by Writers In Treatment that presents works that delve into drug and alcohol abuse, as well as recovery, in honest and complex ways.
The festival is slated for May 3-5 in Inner City Arts, located in Skid Row, and highlights films such as the Oscar-nominated drama Flight as well as lesser-known features and shorts.
But it’s the LAPD’s performance that truly grounds the event, offering compelling plotlines, a deep sense of environment and stellar performances from the cast. The Biggest Recovery Community Anywhere is told through short vignettes that highlight both unique personalities and problems, ranging from the trauma of leaving a dope-sick friend to die in the hospital to the vicious battle of competing desires — to get high, to stay clean — that plays out in an addict’s head.
The show is experimental without being overtly abstract, but more importantly, it feels breathtakingly heartfelt, offering viewers moments of hair-raising drama. Rightfully so, considering that much of the script was culled from the real-world narratives of the cast members and their experiences in the community.
And in his almost three decades of heading the group, Malpede has seen LAPD grow and change with the shifting environment and population of Skid Row. Yet, the most important constant has been the need to give the community a voice beyond just headlines of tuberculosis, crime and filth.
No one denies that Skid Row suffers from both a cracked reputation and the realities of rampant drug abuse and homelessness. But Malpede’s greatest weapon has always been the ability to show both Skid Row residents and outsiders alike the silver lining that surrounds the city’s most maligned neighborhood.
“This show really looks at recovery and how positive that process is, and just how so many people with different stories are realizing how to be better,” Malpede said. “People come here for free programs to heal, and we have the most affordable housing in L.A. — even though you just hear about smoking crack and people dying on Skid Row, it’s an actual, thriving community.”
Fittingly, LAPD’s members come from various walks of life, yet share the common thread of living and working in Skid Row.
Like many other group members, Jennifer Campbell, who delivers the elephant graveyard speech in the role of legendary community organizer Chris Mack, struggled with an addiction to drugs and alcohol since arriving from Chicago 13 years ago. She found LAPD through word of mouth and began working in the group consistently since 2009.
“We work like a family,” Campbell said of the group. “The LAPD has a saying: the only way to get kicked out of the LAPD is by kicking yourself out.”
This feeling of family is something numerous cast members acknowledge and treasure. Anthony Taylor, who was adopted, admits he grew up in a loving home with attentive parents but still was drawn to a self-destructive drug habit. First, it was cannabis and alcohol; then, harder drugs.
In 1991, Taylor waved goodbye to his home in Norfolk, Va. and trekked to Los Angeles to meet his biological parents. He found his father but continued to suffer from his habit, also falling in and out of jail because of petty theft charges.
Four years ago, Taylor joined LAPD. Now, he happily declares that he has been clean for two years.
“I’m living proof,” said Taylor, who recently joined Los Angeles City College’s audition-only Theatre Academy. “Some people get tired — they just don’t know what to do anymore. And we can bring them in the fold and at least help give them direction, a support system.”
Part of that support system comes from the communal way in which Malpede and associate director Henriëtte Brouwers develops LAPD’s projects. With The Biggest Recovery, each of the cast members wrote about both their past and present to help mold the show’s characters and stories.
“There was lots of exploring through improv, though playing games, to see how to make each moment ring true,” Malpede noted.
But naturally, performing material so close to real-world experience can be straining. Though the show’s genuine tone is one of its biggest strengths, it doesn’t come without challenges.
“In a sense, it is difficult — I find myself getting in and out of character, sometimes wondering who I’m speaking as,” said Linda Harris, a consistent LAPD contributor since 2009 who appeared in The Soloist.  “And it doesn’t always feel good to revisit some bad parts of your past. But there’s a message, an important one.”
For Brouwers, the message serves as a multifaceted tool, eliciting different emotions and reactions depending on a viewer’s background.
“We always try to mix our audiences up, and I think everyone gets something different from it. Someone in recovery sees they’re not alone. Others can understand what it’s like to deal with these issues,” she said. “Skid Row is a community, and exposing these stories to others helps people realize that this area isn’t just about what’s often depicted by media.”
Near the end of the show, Campbell addresses the audience with a telling line. “In Skid Row, you see people come back from everything,” she says. “Things you call tragedies.”
The Biggest Recovery shows those tragedies in stark light, leaving blood on the stage with a brutal look at how bad things can get. But the LAPD also knows firsthand the existence of a silver lining.
Prolific community activist and 10-year LAPD member Kevin Michael Key works every day to show others the upside when none seems to exist. The biggest thrill for him is knowing that LAPD’s work could give someone a reason to get up, both literally and figuratively.
“There’s a lot of exhilaration and empowerment to know that these are my words, my thoughts I’m sharing with people to hopefully give them something positive,” Key said. “And it’s not how you perform, it’s about how you better yourself. We have a saying: We love you until you learn to love yourself.”
 
The Biggest Recovery Community Anywhere will be performed as a part of REEL Recovery on May 3-5 in Inner City Arts, located downtown.

As the USC baseball team enters the final month of its baseball season 11 games under .500, it can at least feel good that it isn’t having the year Texas Christian is.
Upswing · USC freshman outfielder Timmy Robinson (center) has had plenty to cheer about after his recently snapped 12-game hitting streak. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
TCU actually has a better record than USC this year. But while the youthful Trojans (16-27, 8-13) were expected to struggle, the Horned Frogs certainly were not. They started the season ranked No. 14 by Baseball America, fresh off a 2012 campaign that saw them come within two games of making the College World Series. But TCU comes to Dedeaux Field tonight  just 21-23 on the season and just 8-10 in the less-than-stellar Big 12 conference.
The reason for the Horned Frogs’ woes is the team’s struggles at the plate. As a team, TCU is hitting just .242 this season and has 355 hits in 44 games. The main victim of poor run support has been No. 2 starting pitcher Brandon Finnegan, who has a 2.12 ERA this year but a stunning 0-6 record.
“Their pitching numbers are just stupid,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “[Finnegan] touches 95 [miles per hour] and he’s their second-best pitcher.”
On the mound in game one for TCU will be Morrison Preston and his 1.31 ERA. USC will counter with junior ace Bob Wheatley, who has a 1.84 ERA — impressive in its own right.
With the dominant pitching of TCU, runs will be at a premium all weekend. As such, added pressure will be put on USC’s pitching staff to limit the opportunities for the Horned Frogs. That might not sound too difficult against a team struggling at the plate the way TCU is, but that doesn’t mean Hubbs isn’t worried about it.
“We cannot give up free bases,” Hubbs said. “We can’t afford to give them any extra opportunity.”
Though TCU might struggle to create runs, USC has been prone to “gift” runs to its opponents, as Hubbs put it. The Trojans have given up at least 283 so-called “free bases” this year — 190 walks, 50 hit batsman and 43 errors. For comparison, USC’s opponents have given the Trojans 190 “free bases.”
In the seventh inning alone of Tuesday’s 9-5 loss to Pepperdine, USC surrendered six runs (six unearned) as a result of three walks, two errors (including a passed ball), a hit batsman and a wild pitch.
“It was disappointing,” Hubbs said of USC’s defense. “That’s a game that we should win.”
All season, the Trojans have found themselves out of games that they should be in, including a memorable six-error afternoon against Oregon.
“It’s tough to say what’s been going on,” USC junior infielder Kevin Swick said. “At a certain point, it becomes a lack of confidence, but I really don’t know what’s causing the problems. We’ve just got to be better and mentally stronger and figure it out.”
With games this weekend expected to be close, low-scoring affairs, the Trojans cannot afford unforced errors. With only a handful of upperclassman pitching regularly for USC, the youthful pitching staff has been prone to bouts of major inconsistency and control issues — especially the bullpen.
“Wheatley doesn’t walk a lot of guys,” Hubbs said. “And [Friday starter sophomore] Wyatt [Strahan] has had his issues but he’s been much better lately. So that will be good for us. The key will be the bullpen. We’re going to need to find some guys who can be consistent and reliable.”
The same has been said all season, and not just about the bullpen. There is a lot of talent on this Trojan team, but not an awful lot of experience. And it takes both to win at this level.
But a number players have made tremendous strides. Freshman outfielder Timmy Robinson, for example, has been the embodiment of this freshman class. Robinson started his year off 2-for-25 and batting .080. Before last weekend, he had a 12-game hitting streak and had raised his average to .248. The hitting streak ended at the hands of No. 5 Oregon State this past weekend, but the improvement hasn’t been lost.
“If you look at Timmy at the beginning of the season, he just couldn’t figure it out,” Swick said. “But now he’s really catching on, which is great to see. There’s been improvement all around.”
With the season more or less a lost cause for USC, the team’s focus has shifted to finishing this year on a strong note and building momentum for next year.
“Coach Hubbs always says, ‘Get better a little bit every day,’” Swick said. “If we do that, it’s going to give us some momentum for next season.”
As the 12-time national championship program closes in on its ninth non-winning season in the last 10 years, Hubbs reflected on the state of his program.
“We’ve been talking as a team about the higher level of performance we need to have,” Hubbs said. “There’s a higher level of performance we have to maintain, or rather attain, to get the program back where it needs to be.”
First pitch for tonight’s game at Dedeaux Field is scheduled for 6 p.m.
The team obviously needs better players, and better coaching. Take a look at the roster. Who deserves the 11.7 scholarships which is good for twelve big time players in actuality. Next season could be worse if James Roberts, Kevin Swick and Bob Wheatley leave early while Adam Landecker and Greg Zebrack are seniors.

For the No. 4 USC women’s sand volleyball team, its entire season has led up to this tournament.
The team will finally be put to the ultimate test in the second-annual American Volleyball Coaches Association collegiate sand volleyball national championship in Gulf Shores, Ala., beginning Friday.
This will be the Women of Troy’s second consecutive appearance in the tournament, making them two for two in their two years of eligibility as a varsity sport.
“We are looking forward to going down to Alabama and playing our style of beach volleyball,” USC head coach Anna Collier said. “It should be challenging but we have prepared ourselves enough to do well through competing a lot this season.”
USC will begin team play on Friday against No. 5-seeded North Florida at 7 a.m. The winner of that match will face undefeated and top-ranked Pepperdine, a team that has not lost a single match in its two-year-old program and is 18-0 this season.
Pepperdine also defeated the Women of Troy twice earlier in the season and owns the title of defending national champion. That match would take place at 10 a.m.
USC (14-6) will first have to take care of North Florida (16-3), who earned an automatic bid to the championship by winning the Atlantic Sun Conference championship.
The Ospreys went a 8-0 in conference play this year, and the team’s only losses came out of conference to Georgia State, University of Alabama at Birmingham and Louisiana Monroe. Monroe is the No. 6 seed in the tournament. All of these losses came in five sets.
USC will be joining a six-team field that includes many top teams in the nation. Defending national champion Pepperdine is set to participate, as is No. 2 seed Long Beach State and No. 3 seed Florida State.
The two teams in the tournament that the Women of Troy have not faced this season are North Florida and No. 6-seeded Louisiana Monroe.
In addition to the team tournament, there will also be a single-elimination, 16-team pairs championship featuring the top duos in the nation.
Both the No. 1 pair, composed of junior Kirby Burnham and graduate student Stevi Robinson, and the No. 2-ranked pair, senior Katie Fuller and freshman Cinnamon Sary, will be representing USC.
Burnham and Robinson are coming off an exhibition tournament win against the USA Junior National Team, which should prove beneficial to the pair’s momentum going into the championship.
“Right now, we are trying to focus on our first match against North Florida,” Robinson said. “But we will worry about the two-on-two matches when the time comes.”
The Women of Troy’s two pairs teams will begin play in the pairs championship on Sunday at  6 a.m. Portions of both the team and pairs competitions will also be available on the CBS Sports Network.
USC’s exhibition against the USA Junior National Team was additionally beneficial in that it gave the Women of Troy a look at the same style employed by its future AVCA competition.
“These games really gave us a look at the scrappy, beach-style games of teams like North Florida or Louisiana Monroe,” Collier said. “That should help us a lot for the AVCA [championships].”
Whatever the results of the tournament are, USC has made an immediate impact in just two years of competition to become one of the top-ranked programs in the nation. Though the team has fared well at brand-new Merle Norman Stadium, it has yet to knock off a top-three-ranked team in the nation.
This weekend’s tournament will provide USC with the opportunity it needs to join the nation’s upper echelon of elite programs.

When it comes to dominating the competition in the pool, nobody does it better than the Vavic family. Following a season in which head coach Jovan Vavic and his son Nikola guided USC to its fifth straight men’s water polo NCAA title, Jovan Vavic and daughter Monica have won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation coach of the year and MPSF player of the year honors, respectively, after leading the Women of Troy to a win in the MPSF title game and earning the No. 1 seed in the upcoming NCAA tournament.
Lead the way · USC head coach Jovan Vavic has now won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation coach of the year award a total of 10 times. He’s also been named the national coach of the year 11 times. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
For Jovan Vavic, the honor is his fourth coach of the year award for the women’s team and 10th overall. After leading the team to a 24-1 season, including two big upsets against reigning national champion and preseason No. 1 Stanford, his selection is largely undisputed. His coaching abilities were highlighted by the emergence and integration of the USC system of many first-year USC stars, including freshmen Anni Espar and Jayde Appel and junior Hannah Buckling, who transferred to USC from Sydney University.
Not to be outdone by her brother Nikola, who also won MPSF player of the year honors in the fall, sophomore Monica Vavic holds her own in the family. In addition to her player of the year honor, Monica Vavic leads the conference with 71 goals this season, making her fourth on the list of single-season goals scored by a USC player. A force on both offense and defense all season long, her nine goals this past weekend in the MPSF tournament earned Vavic a spot on the all-tournament team and also earned her first-team all-MPSF honors for the season. Vavic’s selection as MPSF player of the year is the ninth time in history that a USC player has won the award. Her career 110 goals lead the current roster.
Along with Monica, teammates Espar and junior goalie Flora Bolonyai were selected as first team all-MPSF players. Espar, a reigning silver medalist at the 2012 London Olympics with the Spanish national team, blasted 25 goals this season, six of which came this past weekend in the MPSF tournament. Bolonyai has anchored the Trojan defense all season, hauling in an average of just fewer than eight saves per game, including nine big ones against Stanford in the MPSF title game.
Junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist, who serves as co-captain of the team, was named to the all-MPSF second team. Buckling, also named MVP of the MPSF tournament, received an honorable mention distinction.
The Women of Troy will begin their last leg of their run to the title game May 10 in Cambridge, Mass. Their first round match pits them against No. 8-seed Pomona-Pitzer (18-16) at  2:15 p.m.

As the 2012-13 school year comes to a close, it is only natural for students to reflect on their time at USC. For seniors about to embark on the next phase of their lives, the most common thought is most likely along the lines of “where did the time go?” For underclassmen, time might not seem to be moving quite as quickly.
In any case, the school year has just about reached its end, and though there are still some USC athletic teams playing out the ends of their seasons, the year in sports has mostly reached its end, too.
And the results of the past year have been mixed, to put it mildly.
We all remember the year’s promising start. With each stride of Marqise Lee’s 75-yard season-opening touchdown catch-and-run, we were all sure this football season was going to be one to remember. I won’t devote too much time on this subject, but let’s just say the outcome was a tad underwhelming.
But though the Trojan football team stole most of the headlines, other USC teams were quietly thriving.
What the USC men’s water polo team has accomplished during the past five years is nothing short of amazing. It was the antithesis of the school’s football team. Entering the season as four-time national champions, the bar could not have been set higher. Yet head coach Jovan Vavic led his team to a perfect 29-0 record and unprecedented fifth consecutive national title.
This success in the pool has become the norm at USC, and Vavic is currently in the pursuit of another national championship — this time with the school’s women’s water polo squad, which is ranked No. 1 in the country.
But Vavic’s team wasn’t the only one taking care of business in the fall. The women’s volleyball team went 30-6 in 2012, advancing all the way to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament before falling to Texas, a school that went on to win the national championship. Both the men’s and women’s tennis teams had successful fall seasons, and they are each ranked No. 5 in the current Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings.
That success has carried into the spring, a time when many other USC teams are also prospering. The women’s sand volleyball team, in just its second year of varsity competition, is ranked No. 4 in the nation and is still in the midst of postseason play. Keeping with the spirit of new beginnings, the Women of Troy lacrosse team exceeded all expectations this season with a fourth-place finish in its conference and a postseason berth in its very first year of varsity play. These are just some of the many success stories that USC has enjoyed.
The year was not without more disappointment, though. The once-proud baseball program began the year with an abrupt coaching change and continues to struggle, currently toiling in ninth place in the Pac-12, continuing the year’s up-and-down theme.
But perhaps no USC athletic team embodied the 2012-13 year like the men’s basketball team. Coming off of a historically unsuccessful 2011-12 season, the team showed signs of life during this past season. Victories over UCLA and Arizona provided fans with excitement and promise that the team would turn the corner.
But a disastrous end to the season, in which two players were suspended from the team, ultimately killed any momentum the team had. USC’s final record was 14-18 after a first-round exit in the Pac-12 tournament.
In the aftermath of the underwhelming season, however, the program received a shot in the arm in the form of a new coaching hire. In tabbing Andy Enfield as head coach, Athletic Director Pat Haden provides fans with hope — hope that the future is bright, and that past struggles will ultimately pay dividends.
And hope is what the rest of the Trojan teams will hang their hats on as well. The USC athletic program is a proud one, and the 2012-13 school year is one that, ultimately, deserves to be celebrated. The high-profile teams might have fallen short of expectations, but collectively, the year has been one that the whole Trojan family should be proud of.
And for those few teams unhappy with how they performed this past year, they have reason to smile, too.
Because there’s always next year.

The USC women’s lacrosse team was projected at the start of its inaugural season to finish seventh in the nine-team Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. Not only did the team exceed expectations in its first season, but it’s still playing after the regular season has already come to a close.
New beginning · Freshman midfield Paige Bonomi, fourth on the team in points with 42, hopes to lead the Women of Troy to an upset over Denver. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy will play the first postseason game in program history against Denver on Thursday, May 2, at 4:30 p.m. in Eugene, Ore.
USC (8-9, 5-3 MPSF) won its final two games of the regular season, including a 12-11 win over San Diego State (8-8, 3-5 MPSF) in a winner-take-all game for the No. 4 seed.
Freshman attack Caroline Cordrey and freshman midfield Amanda Johansen each picked up four goals and an assist to lead the USC offensive attack. Freshman defender Kelsey Dreyer finished with four draw controls, four caused turnovers and three ground balls, while freshman goalie Liz Shaeffer picked up six saves.
“Going into the preseason rankings, people didn’t know what to expect from us, so I think that has a lot to do with our lower ranking,” Cordrey said. “We have really been working hard all season long, progressing every single game, getting better and better. We beat teams that were ranked above us and we’re really peaking at the right time, so right now we’re feeling good heading into the MPSF [tournament].”
The USC offense is led by freshman attack Caroline de Lyra, who ranks second in the MPSF with 50 goals, 41 assists and a total of 91 points. Johansen leads the conference with 5.59 draw controls per game and is second on the team with 39 goals and 15 assists. Cordrey has 38 goals on the season, while freshman attack Paige Bonomi has 36. Freshman defense Courtney Tarleton ranks second in the conference with 1.71 caused turnovers per game.
Denver (16-1, 8-0 MPSF) is led by attack Kara Secora, who leads the MPSF in goals with 51, and attack Jill Remenapp, who is third in the conference in assists per game (1.87) and eighth in points per game (3.33). Attack Kate Henrich leads the conference with 3.53 caused turnovers per game and 3.24 ground balls per game.
The Women of Troy hope to bounce back from their previous match against the No. 1 seed in the tournament and No. 11-ranked team in the nation. The Pioneers are currently riding a 14-game winning streak, including a 16-11 win against USC at McAlister Field on March 31.
“It’s a nice thing to play someone you’ve played before,” USC head coach Lindsey Munday said. “You understand them a little better, you know what they’re capable of, but Denver is a great team. They’ve had a phenomenal year, so we’re going to have to play really well in order to compete.”
A victory against Denver would put USC in the MPSF championship game against either No. 2-seeded Stanford (11-5, 6-2 MPSF) or  No. 3-seeded California (9-6, 6-2 MPSF) on Saturday at 1 p.m. A win in the final would give the Women of Troy an automatic berth in the NCAA championship, with the first round taking place on Friday, May 10. USC’s only three conference losses this season have come against the other three teams in the tournament, but Munday feels that familiarity could work in her team’s benefit.
“It’s exciting to be able to play a team that’s beaten you before and see if you can come out on the other end,” Munday said. “I think it’s just going to take a total team effort to do it, but on any given day, any team can beat anyone. We have to go in confident and we have to go in hungry for the win, and not just happy that we made the tournament.”

In his final Pac-12 competition of his career, senior Sam Smith earned a top-20 finish, but his  No. 11 Trojans faltered their way to seventh place at the conference championships at the Los Angeles Country Club.

Smith found his stride during Tuesday’s third round, turning in a solid 1-over 71 after struggling in Monday’s opening 36-hole marathon.
The senior fired another 71 during Wednesday’s fourth and final round, moving him up to 17th place. Smith finished four strokes ahead of sophomore Anthony Paolucci, who tied for 27th.
Just one stroke behind Paolucci was senior Stewart Hagestad, who, in perhaps the best story of the event, came from the sixth position to battle for the team lead.
Paolucci came out on fire during Monday’s first 18 holes, shooting a blistering 3-under 67. The sophomore then turned in a disappointing 7-over 77 to finish the day, tying him with Hagestad to lead the team.
It was Smith, however, who overtook the pair over the final two days with the consistency he displayed all season. Freshman Yi Keun Chang and junior Jeffrey Kang rounded out the top five for the Trojans.
As expected, the No. 1 California Golden Bears took the team championship, stretching its lead over No. 5 UCLA from two strokes to 12 by the end of the day. No. 7 Stanford and No. 6 Washington finished third and fourth, respectively, with unranked Arizona State rounding out the top five. The individual leaderboard was a bit more surprising, with Cal’s No. 5-seeded senior Max Homa winning the title. The Bears’ Michael Weaver took home second place, and UCLA’s Anton Arboleda and Washington’s Chris Williams tied for third. USC head coach Chris Zambri, who expected his team to make a run at a conference title, was upset with the ultimate result.
“This week was definitely disappointing,” Zambri said. “But the fact is we still have tons to play for in the coming weeks, and we have to keep our focus there.”
The Trojans, now riding a streak of three consecutive team finishes without a top-five finish, must look to regroup for the upcoming NCAA tournament. Though the team is certainly not peaking at the right time, Zambri remains confident the squad will improve in time.
“We’re looking forward to regionals,” Zambri said. “We have two weeks to get some things figured out. We need to improve fast.”
The squad has an advantage going into the postseason, having consistently played some of the toughest teams in the country all season. Being No. 11 in the nation and finishing seventh in a conference tournament, though disappointing, does not appear so bad when the conference has four top-10 teams.
Last year, a similar Trojan squad traveled to Ann Arbor, Mich., and won an NCAA regional behind an excellent performance from Jeffrey Kang, Martin Trainer and Steve Lim. It will take that type of effort from Kang and his teammates to return USC to the NCAA championship round. If the squad can return to its excellent early-season form, in which it tied for first in the Prestige tournament and won the North Ranch Intercollegiate, it should contend for a national championship.
The NCAA tournament begins May 16 and can be followed at the NCAA’s official website and on the Golf Channel.
That is what you get when a former ‘ruin Zambri is the head coach for men. The team disappointed last year in
the ncaa played at home basically at Riviera C.C. Time for Kurt Schuette to take over this team instead of being
the director of both golf programs. Too many chiefs for a minor sport.

A report sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation reveals that the nation’s higher education system is facing a dropout crisis. Produced in part by college presidents, the report titled “The American Dream 2.0” reveals that U.S. universities graduate, on average, an astoundingly low 54 percent of their students within six years. The group says facts such as these are “eroding the American Dream and weakening our nation’s ability to compete.”
Not at USC. Here, the administration does everything in its power to keep students enrolled and to ensure they graduate. And they should.
For the past two years, USC has graduated 90 percent of students within six years, almost 40 points higher than the average and within the range of the country’s top private universities.
As Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Jackson told the Daily Trojan, 25 years ago “[the] six-year graduation rate was in the mid-60s . . .”
This year, for the first time, that number is climbing to 91 percent. Percentages such as this one inspire confidence and trust in the university and ensures students don’t feel like they’re being left out on their own.
Students also say these statistics mean USC is committed to academic excellence.
“We are at a time when having a college degree is necessary to have a job that is part of a successful career path. Having such a high retention rate means that USC is not only doing a fantastic job of accepting committed students, but making sure they graduate,” Jesus-Eduardo Dillon, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering, explained.
The importance of a college degree cannot be overstated. With countless studies demonstrating the increased pay of college graduates versus non-graduates, USC’s intensive commitment to student retention demonstrates its desire to give students the best opportunity to succeed. Students say a host of factors help explain USC’s exceptional job at retaining students.
To officially drop out of USC, students are asked to fill out a leave of absence, allowing them to return to the university if they choose.
The reasons for leaving are diverse. They range from academic troubles to religious missions to military service in a foreign country. Students who are forced to leave the university because of factors beyond their control should not be forgotten. Everyone deserves the chance to graduate, and the importance of letting students know they are always welcome back cannot be overstated.
The university tracks every student who fails to register on time and, after accounting for most students, Gene Bickers, vice provost for Undergraduate Programs, deals with the unaccountables.
“When the last day of the registration period has passed, we run a report of all students that we don’t expect to graduate in the impending semester who are not re-enrolled,” Bickers said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “If we still have not accounted for a student and we haven’t been able to track what they are doing, they get a follow-up email from me. We ask if we can help.”
Bickers said the university has even contacted students over Facebook to reach out and let them know they have options if they are thinking about dropping out.
“We ask if they are running into financial problems, collections problems and if there is there anything we can do.”
Other universities might consider modeling USC’s strategy for retaining students. Though USC undoubtedly holds advantages over similar schools in campus appearance, location and social life.
Bickers and his staff are outstanding examples of using the new opportunities technology provides us to make a difference in the dropout rate. Keeping tabs on students who leave the university and using social media to get in touch with struggling students sets us apart from other universities, but these aspects can also be used to help other universities.
The 1-3 percent of students who take more than five years to complete their undergraduate degree also receive attention and resources from Bickers and the undergraduate programs department. If a student is planning on taking more than five years to graduate, they receive a letter the summer before their sixth year that emphasizes the university’s intent to graduate them the following summer and offers additional advisement options. If students are having difficulty transferring credits from another college, the university assists them with that process.
In the face of a dropout crisis, USC continues to show commitment to its students. Bickers and the staff he works with have ensured that the American dream is alive and well at USC.

The prison must be closed as it stands for hypocrisy and infringes upon international human rights.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
It is unfortunate that the prisoners needed to stop eating to bring the issue back to national prominence because Guantánamo Bay should have closed years ago.
First and foremost, as Obama said during the news conference, the most offensive and shocking problem with Guantánamo Bay is the infinite detention in which the accused terrorists are held without trial or easy access to lawyers.
Not only is this a violation of constitutional rights, this is also a violation of international human rights. The isolated location of the Guantánamo Bay prison means that lawyers cannot contact their clients in prison without flying to the naval base in Cuba. The flight is arduous, costly and takes so much time that many of the lawyers cannot spend enough time with their clients to mount strong legal defenses. In a nation where every person is constitutionally guaranteed the right to a fair trial, these abuses cannot stand; the U.S. must either try the accused with due haste or release them as innocent men.
Furthermore, the prison’s isolated location has led to less oversight for prison officials. The New York Times reported that guards recently placed prisoners who lived communally into individual, isolated cells. Prisoners also report the use of excessive force and brutality from the guards. These kinds of problems are less common in a prison in the United States because there will be more opportunity for oversight from lawyers, government officials and human-rights monitors.
Of course, there has been some resistance to housing these alleged terrorists on American soil. A spokesman for Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said “there is wide, bipartisan opposition in Congress to the president’s goal of moving those terrorists to American cities and towns,” because the alleged terrorists are perhaps seen as dangerous prisoners who were trying to kill Americans.
McConnell’s argument is flawed, however, because no other American prisoners are kept in offshore facilities because they killed Americans. James Holmes, who was charged with killing 12 and injuring 60 when he opened fire at a Batman screening in Aurora, Colo. is currently being held in jail in Centennial, Colo. He allegedly killed more Americans than most of the Guantánamo detainees. If the American penal system is considered suitable to keep the public safe from people such as Holmes, then the public will still be safe if the prisoners are moved from Guantánamo Bay to facilities in the U.S.
This systematic repression of suspected terrorists and the denial of their civil and human rights degrades the United States’ image around the world. By continuing to maintain the Guantánamo Bay prison, the U.S. loses legitimacy when calling for just criminal procedures and fair prison conditions in other nations, such as Iran and North Korea, from which the U.S. sought release of American citizens in recent years. This two-faced attitude creates the perception that the U.S. views itself as superior to the rest of the world.
As a result, other nations, both friend and foe, are less likely to cooperate with America. Worse, terrorist networks, such as al-Qaida, use these incidents to legitimately say that the U.S. is acting poorly as a superpower, thus increasing support for terrorist groups committed to fighting the U.S. and killing Americans. If the U.S. continues to maintain Guantánamo Bay, the terrorists win.

The prison is a way to protect U.S. citizens from the most dangerous criminals and enemies of the country.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Because of this, action must be taken to protect everything that we hold dear. Those who are jealous of Americans’ rights or want to take the country down through shameless murder will be held accountable for their actions. Those who want to hurt us and ruin the very freedoms that we constantly brag about must be stopped.
Currently, there are 100 inmates on a hunger strike at Guantánamo Bay prison, commonly known as Gitmo. According to The New York Times, prisoners are protesting their living situation, as if they checked into a hotel and found it to their disliking.
There is no need to discuss what they might think is excessive force or brutality. Unfortunately for them, there is a reason why these prisoners are in prison to begin with. Unfortunately for them, they did something or said something that alerted officials to their danger. Unfortunately for them, they decided to be enemies of the United States.
On Tuesday, President Barack Obama conducted a press conference in which he recommitted to closing down Gitmo,  something he promised during his first election campaign in 2008.
“The notion that we’re going to keep 100 individuals in no man’s land in perpetuity … All of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this? Why are we doing this?” he said.
Why? Perhaps because they pose some danger to the safety of millions of Americans — or else they wouldn’t be in the prison to begin with. While we must be skeptical of our governmental institutions, we must also trust the government to protect us.
When Obama previously tried to close Gitmo, the move was shot down in Congress, mostly because of the fact that these dangerous detainees would be moved to a maximum security prison in Illinois, according to the Boston Globe.
A spokesman for Sen. Mitch McConnell stated that “there is wide, bipartisan opposition in Congress to the president’s goal of moving those terrorists to American cities and towns.”
Since when does the President of the United States put the well-being of political prisoners before the well-being of his own citizens? The administration should be aiming to protect us — not them.
We cannot pretend to know what goes on behind those bars on that isolated island in Cuba. We do not know if there is torture, if there is excessive force. All we do know is that the prisoners are in prison because of their actions. It is up to the U.S. government to take care of the situation by any means necessary. If one accused terrorist offers important information in a torture session in Guantánamo, then the existence of the prison is worth it.
It sounds depressing — it almost sounds evil. But in order to save ourselves from the hurt and the madness that these prisoners have or have tried to inflict upon us, it is a necessary evil.

With drone killings happening so indiscriminately, is there any law or lawful people left in the USA? 
Why does President Obama need prisons? Are these fellow human beings so valuable to the security of the USA that they need to be force fed?
Now that we have left the battle field of Iraq and Afghanistan, can we safely let the POWs go?
Perhaps a USC law student or attorney can answer:  Although these captives are “irregulars,” without uniform or identity as a soldier of some nation, should they not be considered prisoners of war (POWs)? If their only action was combat against US forces, is that a justiceable crime? Simply being an enemy soldier fighting against the US wasn’t a crime during our past wars. Of course, you can answer that Congress did not formally declare war this time, but declared wars are likely a thing of the past for the US. The US Congress will likely never formally declare war again.
Yes, this war is not a war against any nation, so the enemy are not regular soldiers, but they are still enemy combatants. So treat them like POWs. This means that they should not be charged as criminals, should not be accorded lawyers and should not be charged or tried. They should instead remain POWs in detention for the duration of the war. Yes, it could be a long war. Too bad. They should have thought of that before volunteering to become mujahadeen (holy warriors of Islam) and waging jihad (holy war) against the US.  
So how about Guantanamo, then? The geography of their POW camp is irrelevant. The Arizona desert would be OK, too. One way or another, the mujahadeen taken captive while in combat against US forces should be kept in a POW camp, whether at Guantanamo or elsewhere, until the holy war is over or they are far too old to be a threat.
Wow. As a Trojan and a DT alumnus, I’m embarrassed that someone so full of delusional xenophobic and fascist vitriol as Sheridan Watson could serve as an editorial director.
Despite this comment being rather harsh, I can’t help but agree. The way you very ignorantly throw around patriotism in the form of wanting to continue locking away so-called American hating ‘evildoers’ because they might be plotting to hurt Americans makes your response to Dan’s argument elementary and frankly, humorous.
Especially after a recent terrorist attack.
Gitmo is one of the cleanest,most comfortable places these war criminals will spend part or all of their lifetime in. Remember, these folks are out to kill anyome who disagrees with their way of life. They are bound to kill the infidel, at any cost, in order for them to achieve their place in their society. Gitmo is the safest place for them to be incarcerated.
When you’re at war, POWs are held in prison until the wa is over. Obama and Holder’s desire to bring these criminals into our country, to give them rights as Americans to due process of law, is unconstitutional and treasonous. 
The author of this article is misgided by the communist run left wing of the lkberal political movement, and will only serve to take away our rights as American citizens and give rights to non-citizens, using the humanitarian concept. This is a smokescreen folksand if you allow it to continue, you and your offspring will be living in a country that you will not recognize. Be careeful what you ask for. Obama’s ineffective leadership and presidential administratiois proving my point, on a dail basis. Amateurs and neophytes = failed presidency.
agreed….any marathon runner readers think they should release the gitmo prisoners?

With finals bearing down upon us, most students are looking forward to study days as a break from the madness, as a welcome lull before the impending storm hits. But what about all the students who dread those long, empty days? What about the students who drive themselves crazy trying to break the monotony of study days with meaningful and fulfilling activities? For those who are looking for a break during these stressful days, here is a suggested list of activities to get you through the doldrums (as for the sane rest of us, we’ll be napping to our hearts content and numbing our minds with online TV marathons).
 
May 3:  Attend a movie screening at the School of Cinematic Arts
Finally, something more terrifying to think about than your finals! For all you horror movie fans out there, the School of Cinematic Arts will be screening “Purge” from 7 p.m to 10 p.m at the Ray Stark Family Theatre, SCA 108. Make sure to buy tickets fast before they run out.
Get tickets here.

 
May 5: Take a tour of every coffee shop on campus
Whether you’re trying to avoid the line at TroGro, had one too many iced drinks from Coffee Bean or just need a change of scenery, scoping out all the coffee options on campus is a good way to waste a solid chunk of time. Here is the list of all the places whose coffee you can sample: Trojan Grounds, LiteraTea, Coffee Bean (Campus Center), Coffee Bean (School of Cinematic Arts) Ground Zero, the Law School Café, Popovich Café, Shop Café (in the Architecture building), Seeds, Tutor Café (in Viterbi), or URBNMARKET (we’ve never heard of it either). If all else fails, you can just revert to the delectable options at EVK (adventurous, but risky).
 
May 7: Experience the Los Angeles Tea Lovers Festival
When you’ve become adequately sick of coffee, switch gears and opt for a tea overload at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena. Open from May 3 until May 28, the Festival includes a seminar on how to read tea leaves, focused labs on how teaware affects tea taste, and a “Tea and Chocolate Workshop”, among other random but interesting events. The festival even has a Mother-Daughter Indian Tea Party planned for Mother’s Day.
Learn more at www.TeaLoversFestival.com.
 
May 9: Sleep.
 
May 11: Check out the new drive-in movie theater Downtown
Most people these days have never been to a drive-in movie theater, so why not start now? It’s a great way to experience something new in L.A relatively close to school. During study days (on May 11) this unconventional theater will be playing Alien— grab a date, friend, or fly solo and settle in for a relaxing night of alien gore and loud explosions.
You can find tickets here.
 
May 13: Visit all the museums in the area
Step off campus (but not very far off campus) for the day and enjoy a trip to the multiple museums surrounding USC. If informative IMAX movies or checking out the Endeavor space shuttle is your thing, try the California Science Center (it’s free admission for their permanent exhibit galleries). Or, you could head over to the Natural History Museum for the new Dinosaur Hall exhibit, along with the chance to meet a live animal (a real live animal, wow!!!) from 3-3:30 p.m.
 
May 15: Go to the Los Angeles Career Fair
The most exciting thing way to celebrate the completion of finals week is clearly to visit a Job Fair— and from 11 a.m until 2 p.m on May 15 you can do just that. Head on over to the Holiday Inn at LAX, whip out those resumes and business cards and get ready for banal small talk en masse! 18+ only.

The Gayle Garner Roski School of Fine Arts announced Wednesday that Professor Erica Muhl will serve as the new dean of the school. Muhl will begin work as dean immediately.
Muhl has served as the interim dean of the school since September 2012, yet has been working as an advisor for the school since January 2012.
Muhl has worked to structurally change the curriculum and programs of the school, according to a press release. For example, Muhl has introduced several new international partnerships for educational exchanges. In addition, she has stressed outreach between the school and alumni constituencies for fundraising activities.
Before serving as interim director, Muhl was a professor composition and associate dean for faculty affairs at the Thornton School of Music. In addition, she chairs the University Committee on Academic review. Muhl also holds a doctorate in musical arts from USC.
Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett said that Muhl’s timely appointment will benefit the school and its progress.
“The appointment of Dr. Muhl comes at an auspicious time for the Roski School,” Garrett said in a statement. “Situated in one of the cultural capitals of the Pacific Rim and nurtured by the university’s vibrant and growing artistic and scholarly community, the school is poised to ascend to the highest levels of creative work and recognition under the leadership of Dr. Muhl.”
In 2012, Roski rose in ranking as a fine arts school in the U.S. News & World Report from No. 37 to No. 36.
Muhl’s work also expands outside of the university. She served as the assistant conductor for the Los Angeles Opera Theater, Seattle Opera and the Pacific Northwest Wagner Festival’s Der Ring des Nibelungen. Furthermore she has received several grants and awards from organizations such as the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Endowment for the Arts.
Garrett’s said Muhl’s diverse background in the arts will enhance the program for students and faculty alike.
“In addition to a successful career as a performing and creative artist, she also brings to the position extensive experience across the arts and humanities in the areas of tenure, faculty development and mentoring, transformative faculty hires, strategic vision and academic excellence,” Garrett said in a statement.
