Before embarking on a nationwide tour this Friday, front man Andrew McMahon had a spur of the moment idea to work out the bands’ kinks — play a warm-up show at the Viper Room Tuesday evening and bring along up-and-coming local band Lady Danville.

The plan was finalized Tuesday morning and word spread like wildfire about this impromptu show.
“Welcome to band practice,” McMahon said as they took the stage that night. “We’re doing this to work some things out before the tour starts, so it may be a little rough, but that’s why we invited our friends.”
Hailing from Orange County, Jack’s Mannequin has deep roots to the Southern California area, so it is no surprise that McMahon and the rest of the band consider Angelinos to be friends and that there was no better way to catch up with those friends than to hang out for a night playing some of their old music.
Beginning their set with “Into the Airwaves” set the energetic tone of the evening, and each “friend” (all seemingly clad in dark-rimmed glasses, multi-colored plaid T-shirts and a variety of keds) in the audience sang every word.
The evening continued to feel like a jam session at McMahon’s apartment rather than an actual concert, and, just as he had warned the audience before the show started, there were several hiccups that caused the show to not go quite as planned.
With a couple amplifier and guitar problems afflicting their guitarist, Bobby Anderson, right at the beginning, McMahon resorted to whipping out some solo songs he was not planning on playing, which continued the raw feeling of the evening. Not long after Anderson got his complications under control, bassist Jonathan Sullivan’s bass slipped and landed out of tune, which caused another hold up for the band.
“We’re just a calamity up here,” McMahon joked as he stalled by playing “Turn the Beat Around,” by Gloria Estefan. “We’re playing my friend’s wedding soon, so we’re working on some music like ‘Turn the Beat Around.’ Yes, that’s right. Jack’s Mannequin is available for weddings.”
All joking aside, once the instruments were situated, the band began to “get into a groove” and played a majority of the songs from their album Everything in Transit, and a select few from The Glass Passenger.
McMahon, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in June 2005, slowed down a bit and played a song that was the most emotional part of the evening; a song called “The Skyscraper,” which he said was written about the first nurse he had when he was going through treatment — a woman named Diane.
He sung of exhaustion, his insecurity with the illness and how Diane would “plug his machines back in” when he was feeling weak, a song that tugged at the heartstrings of every “friend” in the crowd.
As they finished up their set, they thanked everyone and sang the popular “La La Lie,” about yet another heartbreak and being “ready to move on.”
The evening moved on right along with them, and acoustic rock band Lady Danville came out to close off the evening in a soft, sensitive and harmonious way.
The band that began as a duet based out of a UCLA a cappella group, accompanied with a keyboard, acoustic guitar and a cajon drum, along with the powerful harmonies of the three band mates’ voices, took the audience on a visual journey through each of their songs.
Lady Danville’s keyboard player Michael Garner, guitarist Daniel Chang and percussionist Matthew Frankel led the audience in a sing along to their song David, causing the crowd to erupt in a melodious swirl of “da-da-da’s” and “ba-ba-ba’s”.
Finishing off the night, the guys stepped out from behind the microphones with only a harmonica, ukulele, maracas and their voices to play a song about a woman doing merciless and terrible things to them, and them “wanting her back” regardless, which left the crowd laughing.
Jack’s Mannequin begins their U.S. tour on Friday beginning in Seattle and finishing off March 5 in Norfolk, Va., and Lady Danville is set to play the Green Schools Benefit in Venice, Calif. on February 11.

That loud scream you heard Tuesday evening was the sound of Lost fans nationwide welcoming the return of their favorite show. The complex and compelling series kicked off its sixth and final season with the fallout of last season’s ending, new characters and new questions regarding time travel.
Fans of the series began the season premiere “LA X” with a very familiar scene — Oceanic flight 815, flying from Sydney to Los Angeles. Dr. Jack Shepherd enjoys a drink while the plane experiences turbulence. Wait, isn’t that how the first episode began? Did the network put in the wrong episode?
Apparently not. Picking up where the last episode left off, an electromagnetic pocket of energy mixed with a nuclear explosion —people who are new to the show, don’t ask, it would take way too long to explain — failed to reset the time line, but instead sent the survivors on the island into the present (2008 for the show). Yet, at the same time, there is another time line at work, set in 2004, where Oceanic 815 does not crash.
In many ways, as the series begins its end, it brings things back full circle. However, unlike the previous time line, there are subtle differences that raise a ton of questions. Locke is still paralyzed, and Kate is still under arrest, but Hurley is now lucky instead of cursed and Desmond of all people ended up on the plane. Umm…what?
The new time line is not without its own mysteries. Jack seems to remember certain things that he shouldn’t, like meeting Desmond, while Charlie seems to recall being fated to die. Are these just jokes from the writers, or hints that this new time line isn’t as independent from things as expected? Knowing Lost, it’s probably the latter, with two dozen twists thrown in. Not that that’s a bad thing.
Despite the new time line, the season premiere is deeply rooted in the past events, and the episode succeeds because of it. The first half of the two-part episode is essentially the fallout of season five’s “The Incident.” In the past, Juliet and Sayid are on the verge of death, while in the present, Locke was revealed to be dead, while a spirit impersonated him, forcing Ben to kill the seemingly immortal Jacob, all while the Others’ leader Richard Alpert realizes with horror what’s going on.
The cast members, as they have been in the past five seasons, are at the top of their game. From capturing their disappointment at being unable to fix things in one time line, to reverting back to their season one personalities in the other time line, every actor is excellent. Terry O’Quinn’s turn as Jacob’s enemy gives the already versatile actor a chance for a darker approach, and his affable, relaxed manner makes him all the more menacing. Meanwhile Josh Holloway’s Sawyer’s slow burn in the wake of his lover’s death is both entertaining and foreboding. Is another showdown between Sawyer and Jack looming?
Meanwhile, a lot of old cast members returned, helping the show recreate the feel of the first season. Ian Somerhalder briefly appears as Boone, while fan-favorite couple Rose and Bernard get what looks to be a final appearance. Even Dominic Monaghan is back as the drug-addled Charlie, and it looks like the plane landing in Los Angeles was actually a bad thing for him. Whether or not these characters will return in this time line remains to be seen, but their presence definitely added to the new time line.
The new additions to the cast are equally interesting. Mark Pellegrino returns briefly as Jacob, while Hiroyuki Sanada takes on the role of a mysterious Other. Sanada is probably the best addition, blending authority with aggression and mystery. His performance is so interesting it almost distracts from the new questions raised by his character. Almost.
To say the season premiere raised some questions is an understatement. What is the purpose of the Temple? What’s the deal with the alternate time line, and what’s changed for each character? Seriously, why does Richard Alpert not age? One would think that the show would start answering questions instead of raising new ones.
It is hard to really judge the show. After five seasons, viewers have almost grown spoiled by Lost’s strong production value, talented cast, and complex and intelligent story. Still, “LA X” presented Lost with a new direction, more tantalizing questions, and the possibility for more than a few answers as the series begins its road to the end. If the next few episodes can elaborate on some of the conundrums of the premiere, then this season should shape up to be just as good, if not better than the last few, which is just what the fans of Lost have come to expect.
True, they did, but that was back in 2001. We don’t know what exactly is different with the new timeline. For all we know Desmond never had to enter the sailboat race, so he never trained. I mean, after all, he was on the plane instead of on the Island.
Desmond and jack met before they were on the island on the steps of a stadium. I think in australia, they had a quick conversation before desmond gave Jack some simpe advice.

In sports, teams are not always afforded a second chance to win a championship. But for the 2010 USC women’s water polo players, a second chance is in the works.
Team leader · Senior two-meter Kami Craig is part of a returning group of players who hope to improve upon last season’s NCAA final loss. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
That is because the Women of Troy, although they finished with a near perfect 26-2 record and a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) title in 2009, fell to crosstown rival UCLA 5-4 in the finals of the NCAA Tournament one year ago. After two consecutive seasons losing in the NCAA finals, the Women of Troy are out to capture that elusive championship in 2010. But despite the fact that the losses have left bitter tastes in their mouths, they remain optimistic.
“You learn from every season,” redshirt senior two-meter Kami Craig said. “You’ve been in finals, and you just learn from those experiences. It definitely gives you some extra motivation throughout the season. We’re just excited to come back stronger this year.”
And looking at the preseason outlook, the Women of Troy have a good shot at coming back stronger and earning that elusive national championship. According to the latest national poll, the Women of Troy are ranked second overall, just behind Stanford, who they finished 3-0 against last season.
What inspires so much confidence in these Women of Troy is a solid returning core of players in addition to a young, talented group of freshmen.
Craig, the 2009 recipient of the MPSF player of the year award, leads a offensive unit that accounted for most of the team’s scoring output last year. The Women of Troy return five out of their six top goal scorers, including Craig and junior driver Joelle Bekhazi.
“We have a lot of great players coming back, including Kami,” returning All-American senior goalie Tumua Anae said. “She is obviously a big offensive threat. And we have our two defenders coming back. I think we have good balance this year. Everyone is just hungry and ready to go.”
Anae, along with Craig, leads a group of four returning All-Americans, who will look to rely on their past experience together to help them reach their ever-elusive goal — an NCAA title.
“Experience should help,” Craig further noted. “The longer you can get girls playing and everyone caught up to speed helps. Our freshmen are coming in competing with us, competing with the older girls. You know it’s just experience and practicing like you’re competing in a game. That really brings out the overall experience.”
Anae is a good player in her own right, as the 2009 All-American finished with 123 saves and 4.9 goals against per game last year — some of the best totals in the nation.
Anae’s mental fortitude and leadership should be even more crucial for the Women of Troy this season.
“Last year we learned how to win,” Anae said. “A lot of people in my grade had never won the tournament or the MPSF. I think the experience of winning and knowing how to do well in those big games will serve us well. We just need to execute.”
USC will get its first test today as it takes a quick trip south to face Long Beach State in the season opener.
A strong start will go a long way toward helping the Women of Troy reach their goal of an NCAA championship.
“We all want it more than ever,” Craig said. “It’s our last opportunity to win a ring and we’re just going for it this season. We want to dominate.”

As the second half of Pac-10 conference play begins, the USC men’s basketball team will look to get off on the right foot after dropping two road games in Oregon last weekend.
The Trojans’ (12-9, 4-5) first opportunity to turn things around will come Thursday night, as they host the first place California Golden Bears (14-7, 6-3) to start a new round of Pac-10 opponents. USC sits two games back from Cal in the conference standings in a five-way tie for fifth place, while the Bears are tied for first with Arizona.
“I’d like to see a little more consistent defensive effort, especially on the road,” USC  coach Kevin O’Neill said. When you have four or five minute defensive letdowns, it’s hard for us to win. It’s going to be important for us that we just keep playing hard, and we’ll get our share of wins if we do that.”
Unfortunately for the Trojans, these four or five minute defensive letdowns have been common lately, as they have given up three second-half leads of seven or more points in their last six games, including a 15-point advantage in a loss to Washington State.
Redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity said it seems to be more of an issue of consistency rather than talent that has recently plagued the Trojans’ defense, which currently ranks second in the nation in points per game allowed.
“[Our defensive success in practice] has got to carry over into games,” Gerrity said. “When we had our winning streak, we were playing close to 40 minutes of great defense a game. We’ve got to get back to that level.”
USC’s defense looks to be tested against Cal’s guard duo of Jerome Randle and Patrick Christopher, who average 18.9 and 16.4 points per game, respectively. The two seniors put up 46 combined points in a recent win against Arizona State and then another 30 three days later in a loss to Arizona.
“[Randle’s] a great player,” O’Neill said. “He’s had a wonderful career [at Cal], and he’s the reason why they’re tied for first right now.”
USC has lost five of its last seven games, but, despite the recent disappointments, O’Neill maintains that the team will continue to look forward to its remaining games, rather than dwell on the past.
“We need to win as many as we can and see what else happens around the league and go from there,” O’Neill said. “It’s one game at a time for us. I’ve never been one of those make or break guys.”

The USC women’s tennis team is holding tight to its No. 9 ranking as it rolls undefeated into its fifth home dual match of the year. The Women of Troy (4-0) are set to host the No. 40 Pepperdine Waves (1-2) at 1:30 p.m. today at Marks Stadium.
Unbeaten · All four Women of Troy singles players, including junior Maria Sanchez, above, hold a perfect 4-0 record early in the season. - Amaresh Sunduran Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan 
So far, USC has had an easy time with its competition. The Women of Troy won their last two dual matches last weekend in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association qualifying Kick-Off tournament, first versus No. 60 San Diego and then versus No. 35 Auburn in the final round.
In addition, USC’s nationally ranked singles players have yet to lose a singles match this year. No. 8 Maria Sanchez, No. 18 Danielle Lao, No. 37 Valeria Pulido and No. 39 Alison Ramos are all 4-0 in singles play.
“We’re feeling real confident now, but we’re still super eager to compete so we’re looking to go in hungry and fired up, taking nothing for granted, so that we can stay undefeated,” Lao said. “If we can do that, we’ll continue to play the good tennis we’ve been playing and hopefully be able to build and get better as the season goes on and gets tougher.”
Although Pepperdine is a non-conference opponent, the Women of Troy look to build upon its winning start.
The lineup for the match includes six singles matches and three doubles matches. The lineup is not yet official, but the Women of Troy’s singles lineup is expeted to include Sanchez, Ramos, Lao, Pulido and juniors Leyla Entekhabi and Cristala Andrews.
For doubles play, Sanchez is expected to be paired with junior Lyndsay Kinstler, with Ramos and Lao and Pulido and Andrews rounding out the doubles pairs.
Each win for a singles match earns the team one team point, while the team that wins two out of three doubles matches gets a doubles point. The best of seven points wins the overall match.
USC coach Richard Gallien’s alma mater Pepperdine is coming off its first victory of the season against No. 41 University of Nevada Las Vegas last weekend. USC has won the past 12 meetings with the Waves. Pepperdine last won in 2001 with a 4-3 decision.
“I am excited for this match mainly because I feel like we are on a good roll,” Gallien said. “I have a lot of respect for the Pepperdine team, and I expect a tough fight. It’s our last chance to compete before next week, so our girls are pumped.”

After a disappointing loss to Oregon, the USC women’s basketball team looks to bounce back this week against two of the top teams in the Pac-10.
USC (13-7, 7-2) kicked off the second half of its conference schedule with road games against California and No. 2 Stanford. The Women of Troy beat Cal (11-9, 5-4) earlier this season on a last-second 3-pointer by sophomore guard Ashley Corral.
“We had a tough game against Cal here at home and they’re probably coming out to avenge that loss,” senior guard Hailey Dunham said. “We have to go in with a new focus and correct the things we didn’t do as well the first time we played them.”
One thing USC needs to figure out is a way to slow down the Golden Bears’ inside-out combination of freshman forward/center DeNesha Stallworth and redshirt senior guard Alexis Gray-Lawson. In the first game between the two teams this season, the duo combined for 50 points.
“After that we switched up our post defense,” USC assistant coach Mary Wooley said. “We’re really challenging our [bigs] to play better defense because they let a freshman get 30 points on them.”
USC must also be ready for Cal’s pressure defense. The Women of Troy turned the ball over 18 times against Oregon and spent practice discussing how to overcome it.
“A lot of it comes down to recognizing where we need to be on the basketball floor,” Wooley said. “We try and tell them one thing that counteracts pressure is calmness. If you stop and slow down, the pressure can’t be as effective.”
The road does not get any easier for the Women of Troy after that. USC battles No.2 Stanford (19-1, 9-0) on Sunday in a game that will be televised locally. Stanford won handily at the Galen Center last month and has yet to be challenged this season in the Pac-10.
“Every game that we play we want to measure ourselves against Stanford,” Wooley said. “If we can come out and compete with them I think we can surprise some people.”
This weekend could feature the debut of redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos. The former McDonald’s All-American has been cleared for action after sitting out the last three seasons with knee injuries.
Other members of the team are dealing with injury concerns as well. Corral, who leads the team in scoring, sat out of practice on Monday with a sore heel.
“Everybody’s got bumps and bruises, but I don’t think we’re beat down at all,” Dunham said. “We’re coming out fired up about the Oregon loss.”
The Women of Troy play Cal at 7 p.m. tonight. They take on the Cardinal at 1 p.m. Sunday.

The USC men’s volleyball team did not only have to prove they were the best team on the court last night — they had to prove they were the best team in the country.
In a back and forth thriller with the intensity of national championship game, the No. 2 Trojans fell just short of No. 1 Cal State Northridge in five sets, their second consecutive loss on the road to a top-10 opponent.
Not enough · Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy had 19 kills. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
“The atmosphere was pretty crazy,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said.  “It was real loud, a little bit hostile — we got booed a lot.  But we were our own worst enemy.”
Before stumbling at No. 10 Pepperdine last week, the Trojans (6-3, 4-2) were ranked first in the country and were off to their best overall and league start since 2000. Now USC will have to regroup before Friday’s visit to UC Santa Barbara and next week’s rematch with Pepperdine.
From the first set, the Trojans and Matadors (9-1, 6-1) looked as evenly matched as their rankings predicted. Both teams earned 15 kills apiece and tallied a nearly identical hitting percentage.
But after seven lead changes, an untimely service error from Trojan junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy gave CSUN possession and a 26-25 lead. Two kills and a block from CSUN’s Mike Gaudino pushed the lead to 29-26, and a final service error from junior outside hitter Tri Bourne closed out a losing set for the Trojans.
CSUN followed momentum into the second set, sprinting out to a 13-8 lead with the help of four Trojan service errors. Junior middle blocker Austin Zahn’s five kills helped rally the Trojans to an even match at 18, but the Matadors never relinquished the lead, riding sophomore Matt Stork’s 18 assists to claim the set 30-28.
Down two sets, the Trojans answered emphatically, burying the Matadors 30-9 in the third set. Troy — who finished the night with a team high 19 kills and 13 digs — combined with Bourne, senior middle blocker Hunter Current and freshman outside hitter Riley McKibbin for 12 kills and 11 assists, and never let CSUN within six points.
USC clawed to a 30-26 lead in the fourth to force a tiebreaker, but the Trojans impassioned comeback lost steam in the fifth and final set. With a decisive run, the Matadors raced to a 14-10 lead and won the set, match and nation’s top ranking on an ace from junior Tanner Nua.
“They made a couple of great plays, and at that point I knew we were in a little bit of trouble,” Ferguson said.
Great article! Lots of “color” and details. Felt like I was there.
Sounds like USC worked hard!
Great coverage!
Good writing!!! Great article!!

Lane Kiffin entered the Varsity Lounge of Heritage Hall on Wednesday bleary-eyed and with a blank expression.
Clearly, this was a man who was running on little sleep.
But after a tiring homestretch to national signing day, Kiffin can take solace in the famous line from Glengarry Glen Ross — “coffee is for closers.”
The class of incoming freshmen that signed with USC on Wednesday affirmed Kiffin’s position as a relentless force on the recruiting trail. Moreover, it helped legitimize a coach who has been under fire since taking over his new post. 
“We didn’t want to reach and lower our standards,” Kiffin said. “Very often, you’ll see coaches reach in their first year just to make an impression and sign a certain number of kids.”
The exact rankings are unimportant — it’s a fool’s errand to attempt to quantify how good high school seniors will be before they play at the collegiate level. But by keeping together what had been Pete Carroll’s class and adding his own touch, Kiffin quelled talk of a USC downfall.
Under Carroll, top-ranked recruiting classes became a foregone conclusion. But several top prospects eschewed the Trojans last year, prompting discussions of whether USC had slipped from its perch atop the conference.
With the Pac-10 competition entering an arms race, Kiffin needed palpable results as payoff for all those long nights spent working the phones. The day looked dicey when UCLA went on an early afternoon stretch in which several highly touted prospects chose the Bruins on national television, including two who were considering USC.
“It was pretty easy [to watch] because I kept thinking about that left tackle that might be coming here later in the day,” Kiffin said.
That left tackle is Seantrel Henderson, ranked by some services as the best player in the nation. The 6-foot-8, 335-pound Minnesota native’s verbal commitment adds value and much-needed depth to the Trojans’ roster, but he also shows that USC won’t be beat easily for top players as long as Kiffin is around.
In addition to having geography and timing working against the new USC coaching staff, the members had to convince Henderson that all is well in Troy. While other coaches had in-depth relationships with Henderson, Kiffin had to cobble together what he could in three weeks.
Yet, there Henderson stood on national television, wearing a comically mismatched white No. 10 USC jersey.
When USC hired Kiffin, there were minimal concerns about recruiting. But what the 34-year-old was able to accomplish in less than a month was nothing short of astonishing.
“You have to put him up there among the top five — maybe top three — head coaches in terms of recruiting,” ESPN analyst Todd McShay said Wednesday on ESPNU.
Kiffin’s first class wasn’t without fault, however. There were more than a couple of sought-after players that turned down the Trojans for another school. And with only a handful of linemen and linebackers, the assortment of players looks more like a flag football team than a group you’d put in pads.
But Kiffin admitted the shortcoming and chalked it up to the coaching transition.
“The offensive and defensive linemen have more of a bond with their position coach or the school that they’re going to, so it’s hard to come in late and turn those guys,” Kiffin said.
Despite whatever shortcomings it may have had, Kiffin’s inaugural recruiting effort will be remembered for how he restored faith in the program to recruits who might have looked elsewhere.
“[The recruits] had a sense that things were the same on a lot of fronts here,” Kiffin said. “It’s why I think you saw this class really stay together.”
The next task for Kiffin is showing that he can progress all of the four- and five-star players he hoarded. Carroll came under fire for player development, but Kiffin could make his mark early if he thrives in this area.
But for now, he deserves praise for the job he did in securing his first class.
And maybe he should get that coffee percolating because those class of 2011 players won’t recruit themselves.

Pete Carroll might have started USC’s football recruitment for the 2010 season, but Lane Kiffin was the man who closed national signing day with one of the best classes in the country.
Late risers · Final day signings from top-ranked recruits helped coach Lane Kiffin move up the national recruiting rankings on Wednesday. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
The new USC football coach officially signed 18 players Wednesday, including five five-star recruits, and produced the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation, according to Rivals.com.
USC jumped ahead of Florida, Texas, Auburn, Alabama and other powerhouse programs, helped by the verbal commitment of No. 1 offensive lineman Seantrel Henderson on Wednesday afternoon. ESPN ranks USC’s recruiting class at No. 7, with Florida, Texas and Alabama as the top three.
Henderson joined four other five-star offensive recruits going to USC, including No. 1 running back Dillon Baxter, No. 1 wide receiver Kyle Prater, No. 1 athlete Robert Woods and No. 3 wide receiver Markeith Ambles, to complete a strong offensive class for the Trojans.
“To see a skilled class like this come together is very exciting,” Kiffin said at Wednesday’s press conference. “I’m sure one that Matt Barkley is extremely excited to have around him. These guys will make any quarterback good. So we’re excited.”
The five five-star recruits are more than any other program received. USC’s average recruited player ranking of 4.22 stars was also the highest in the nation.
Although Baxter, Prater and Woods were expected to sign with USC, the statuses of Ambles and Henderson were uncertain heading into national signing day. Fortunately for Kiffin and USC, both players decided to don the Cardinal and Gold, though Henderson has not fully signed with the university yet. Still, it  helped ease the pain of seeing some potential recruits, such as No. 9 linebacker Josh Shirley and No. 9 safety Dietrich Riley, join UCLA’s eighth-ranked class.
“We’re very impressed with this class,” Kiffin said. “There will be more that we add here. I think it’s a dynamic class.”
Joining Kiffin’s top recruits are a number of talented offensive players. USC signed three top-six tight ends, including No. 1 Xavier Grimble, No. 4 Christian Thomas and No. 6 Randall Telfer. Kiffin said he expects them all to compete for jobs at the tight end position to help replace Anthony McCoy next season, but the recruits might also play elsewhere.
USC also locked up No. 5 quarterback Jesse Scroggins and No. 3 running back D.J. Morgan.
While many of the Trojans’ most notable recruits are on the offensive end, Kiffin signed some top defensive talent as well. No. 3 defensive tackle George Uko committed to USC, and No. 9 defensive back Nickell Robey chose the Trojans on Wednesday morning to join Dion Bailey, Demetrius Wright and Anthony Brown in a strong defensive backfield class.
Kiffin’s staff did, however, miss out on some key linebacker recruits. Instead of luring some of the top athletes, USC signed Glen Stanley out of Eastern Arizona Junior College to help create depth and competition at the position.
“All that [ranking] means is we got some very talented players. We’ve got a lot of work to do to coach them, to develop them,” he said.
Kiffin said it spoke volumes for USC’s football program that, even without signing a large number of players, still has one of the best classes in the nation. He also expects some of the new players to make an immediate impact next season, similar to the way he saw wide receiver Mike Williams star on the field as a freshman in 2002, when he caught 81 passes and scored 14 touchdowns.
With recruiting now behind him for the time being, Kiffin said his next step will be piecing together an offensive coaching unit and finalizing his staff for the 2010 season. He said he will begin interviewing potential coaches Thursday morning.

You know you have downloaded music from the Internet at some point or another. It’s so easy to get the latest Matisyahu album or the newest single from Lady Gaga with just a click of the button. It’s quick, easy and gives us new music now. Downloading music is something everyone has done and most people still do.
So, congratulations — you’ve helped kill the music industry but also helped revolutionize it. 
The music industry is one most affected by the rise of the Internet. File sharing, YouTube and piracy struck a blow to the CD-selling business model of the major record labels. Why pay $15 for a hardcopy album when you can get that same thing for free from the comfort of your couch?
And after this year’s Grammy telecast, it’s clear the music industry is never going to be the same. The Internet basically crippled its original way of profit, and it is in the process of adjusting to accommodate that. For every song that a record label takes down on YouTube, two more are going to be uploaded.
The Internet, however, might be the salvation for music. The Internet is great for releasing home-created music. Programs like GarageBand and other music mixers let musically challenged users express themselves in ways they might not be able to. They can remix songs, put together beats and use resources they might not have been able to use previously.
There is a great online music scene, especially in the electronic genre. Musicians like D.J. Steve Porter put their recordings online for the purpose of having others remix and recreate songs. The result is a thriving, interactive community that gives the masses free music. The Internet changed things forever; there’s no going back, no matter how much record labels might want to.
Many bands realize the changing rules in the music scene and actually embrace them.
Radiohead put its album In Rainbows up for free, with a “pay what you think it is worth” system, while Trent Reznor put the latest Nine Inch Nails album online entirely for free, with no pay system at all.
Reznor’s method was successful, and The Slip became an insanely popular album despite little advertising. The method proved so successful that Smashing Pumpkins has adopted a similar one for its new album.
Yet, Trent Reznor, for all of his anti-RIAA statements, is rich. He’s the creative force behind a long-running, successful band and can afford to put out a free album. The local acts struggling to make it, however, need to sell their albums. How many bands could pull off this business model?
Not many, and that is why musicians have taken on a new approach, one that adopts social networking with investment and online promotion with real life effects. And now the Internet is producing online musicians. Websites like Kickstarter.com offer complete funding for a variety of artistic ventures, including music. Musicians put up their projects and an expected budget, and investors donate money to the cause.
Kickstarter is basically the ultimate use of the Internet for real life. Social networking funds real world, tangible copies. Instead of simply releasing a song online for it to become one of many, the website allows for creators to use the best aspects of Internet communication to funds and artistic niches to make unique albums for people to use.
This is an entirely new model for the music industry, and one that it should adopt. It may not be entirely profitable in the traditional sense, but it allows for a wider range of talent to produce their own material and increases the variety of albums out there.
Yes the Internet is a great place for free music, and, yes, we all have at least a few songs we got online. The Internet, however, is good for more than just free samples — it’s a place where musicians can come together to share their music and get the help they need to make their hard-copy album dreams come true. The music industry might not be able to go back to its old model, but for musicians this is a pretty good plan.
So let us take a moment to applaud us, the Internet users. We screwed up the music industry, but we also helped foster the creativity for hundreds, if not thousands of singers, songwriters, D.J.s and musicians. Not bad for people who just wanted to get a few free songs.

The Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center held a massive bone-marrow drive Tuesday to help find a match for a 6-year-old cancer patient badly in need of a transplant, but was still unable to find a donor.
About 700 people showed up to the bone-marrow drive for young Eduardo Morales-Pena, who has battled acute lymphoblastic leukemia since he was a 2-year-old.
“He actually looks really good when you look at him right now. He’s very active, he looks terrific, but his disease is still there,” Dr. Jeff Johnson of LAC-USC Medical Center told KABC7.
Doctors said Eduardo needed a bone-marrow transplant after taking a turn for the worst when his chemotherapy treatments stopped working. according to KCAL2.
Currently, there are no matches in the national donor registry for Eduardo.
“Eduardo is in the fight of his life,” Supervisor Gloria Molina said in a statement. “He desperately needs a bone marrow transplant.”
Bone-marrow matches are more likely to be found from someone of the same race. Doctors said the search for Morales-Pena’s match is harder because there are very few Hispanic donors in the registry.
Officials said they hoped the drive would attract Latinos to come test to see if they were a match.
“All it takes is a simple mouth swab — no needle — to determine whether someone is a match or not,” Molina said.
None of Eduardo’s family members are a match, so his only chance of survival is finding an outside donor.
The hospital hopes to find a donor soon for Eduardo, who loves music and dancing. He is a big fan of Michael Jackson, and his favorite song is “Thriller.”
“I hope that God doesn’t take him from me,”  Ausencia Peña, Eduardo’s mother, told the Whittier Daily News.

What would be the worst way to die? Many have competed with friends to see who can conjure up the most horrific causes of death at one time or another, but the uncomfortable question has wormed its way into everyone’s brain at some point. The thought of these cringe-inducing situations might send shivers down one’s spine, but they have also become a twisted form of entertainment that mega-film franchises such as Saw and Hostel have thrived off of for several years. Writer-director Adam Green has recently entered the ongoing cinematic competition to create the most gruesome death scenario with his new film, the 2010 Sundance Film Festival selection, Frozen.
Help · Writer-director Adam Green employs Hitchcock-like suspense in his latest horror thriller, Frozen. The film follows three snowboarders after they get stuck on a ski list after the slopes close for the evening. - Photo courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment 
The film finds three college students on a weekend skiing trip stranded on a chair lift before their last run of the night. Green, a Massachusetts native, credits his experiences as a young adult skiing at inexpensive resorts complete with shady chair lifts as a major source of inspiration for the story. Enlisting the help of up-and-coming actors, including X-Men’s Shawn Ashmore, the director ambitiously set his sights on achieving a Hitchcockian level of suspense and terror in Frozen.
The concept is undeniably  intriguing. The movie poster’s depiction of a skier dangling off the edge of an ice-crusted chair lift is a brilliant visual representation of the concept’s simplicity and appeal.
Unfortunately, the idea’s novelty factor wears thin fairly early in the picture, and it becomes obvious that the feature film format is simply not the correct medium to execute this story. The filmmakers have stretched out what could have been a genius short film idea or a shamelessly exciting half hour of television into a lumbering 90 minutes of mostly cheap thrills, bone-splitting gore and narcolepsy-inducing dialogue relieved by a few genuinely intense sequences of terror.
Such a high concept idea will inevitably leave many viewers sidetracked by questions pertaining to the feasibility of each event. In the present age of constant communication, for instance, how probable is it that not one of the college students decided to bring along their cell phones on a late-night ski run?
On the other hand, to overanalyze this horror-suspense thriller created for the sole purpose of entertaining audiences is to commit movie sin number one. An audience that nitpicks every inconsequential detail instead of enjoying the movie as a whole would dishearten any director who has labored for months or years crafting his work.
In that spirit, viewers should judge Frozen first and foremost by its ability to create suspense in its audience. This was no easy task for the filmmakers. Similar to the spaceship Nostromo in Ridley Scott’s terrifying and claustrophobic masterpiece Alien, the chair lift in Frozen provides Green with the daunting mission of building tension through the use of camera angles and movement in an equally confined space. Frozen regrettably forgets that a successful suspense thriller fills the confined space it occupies with the presence of strong, complex characters such as Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley character in Alien.
In the fashion of today’s gore fests like the Saw series, audiences are treated to a variety of blood-spattered sequences that will leave them squirming in their seats. The camera does not budge as we see a close-up of the palm of a hand frozen to the lift’s restraining bar tear off as easily as an orange peel. Nor does it avert its focus from the shattered bones sticking out of a severely broken leg. However, like the suspense thrillers of yore with their comparatively primitive makeup effects, it is when the audience does not see the gore that it become most frightened. After one skier jumps off the lift and becomes paralyzed on the ground, the camera focuses on the grimacing faces of his best friend and girlfriend as we hear the blood-curdling screams and desperate pleas of the victim as he gets ripped apart by a pack of ravenous wolves.
The sequence is more disturbing than any visual display of extreme gore shown in the current trend of “torture porn” horror films.
In a script laden with references to classic Spielberg films, the conversation between the two best friends about whether seeing the shark fin come slicing through the water at you is worse than an unknowing surfer being attacked from below perfectly sums up the problem with Frozen.
We watch as the shark fin advances closer to us, but the film’s emphasis on gore and lack of strong characters leaves the cinematic thrill seeker with the same disappointment as discovering that the fin is being steered by two teenage pranksters instead of a real, ruthless man-eating machine.

It is slowly becoming time for serious schoolwork in this new semester — books to be read, papers to be written, equations to be pondered — which can only mean one thing — more coffee.
But coffee consumption isn’t just a college-campus phenomena — over 50 percent of Americans drink the stuff every single day; and the majority of those that drink coffee daily average around three to four cups of it. While coffee is a pervasive part of our workaholic culture, however, its usage is bound to bring up a curious question: Is coffee even good for us?
Although this particular question might not be at the forefront of the average citizen’s mind as they sip on their morning (or mid-day, or nighttime) brew it is something that needs to be considered. The scientific community hotly contests the effects of coffee, but the truth is hard to decipher through the many disagreements, making it difficult for the public to understand what they’re drinking.
Taste and energy seems to be common reasons people drink this bittersweet beverage, but it turns out there are a few more specific facts to be known about coffee.
The most significant ingredient in coffee is obviously caffeine, which is ever-present in our day-to-day beverage consumption.
A common myth that many of us grew up with, however, is that caffeine stunts growth. Recent studies have disproved that quite easily. What caffeine does do, however, is obvious to most people — it stimulates them.
Caffeine is, in fact, categorized as a psychoactive stimulant drug, which sounds about right considering the changes in brain function it causes (and the mental and physical effects of those changes).
However, the negatives of consuming too much caffeine consistently are far too clear to those who have experienced them: insomnia, anxiety, jitters and headaches. Even worse, a tolerance to the drug can build up, creating a bodily dependency on the chemical, withdrawal from which can also lead to the symptoms mentioned previously.
Independent of the caffeine issue, however, coffee has also been shown to lead to gastrointestinal damage and elevated cholesterol levels. Seemingly, all this provides a strong case against coffee consumption — at least until you look at the positive findings.
Coffee drinkers can breathe (and sip) easy, since, despite the many studies showing the drink’s negative effects, the case for coffee seems to be stronger than a Johnnie Cochran defense.
For all the negatives of caffeine and coffee, the benefits of moderate coffee consumption are difficult to deny. Studies conducted in Canada and Europe clearly indicate that those who drink moderate amounts of coffee are “significantly less likely” to develop Alzheimer’s disease and dementia later in life. A Harvard study found consumption to reduce risk of gallstone disease.
Another study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a correlation between coffee and a decrease in the risk of Parkinson’s.
More pertinent to our everyday college lives, coffee was shown to have a clear positive impact on cognitive ability, specifically in terms of short-term memory recall and I.Q. Although it’s good to take such proclamations with a grain of salt, these findings are accepted in much of the mainstream scientific community.
So with coffee drinking in the clear, where on campus does the best brew lie?
* * *
Regular ol’ drip-brew coffee is easy to find and difficult to differentiate. Since brewed coffee campus-wide is nothing remarkable, Starbucks Coffee at the University Village is probably a safe bet, especially considering their standard brew, Pike Place Roast, is freshly made every 30 minutes.
Some coffee consumed by students, however, is based on an entirely different, much more complicated foundation: espresso.
Good espresso is a wonderful thing. Dense, complex and flavorful, it is what many connoisseurs consider to be the truest form of coffee. And they could be right. Develop a taste for well-made espresso and everything else pales in comparison.
It’s unfortunate, then, that good espresso is so hard to come by in the mainstream. A shot of espresso is the result of a unique process. The beans are ground so fine they become a fragrant mahogany dust and then the pure caffiene is extracted by applying hot water at extreme pressure.
At nine times the regular atmospheric pressure on Earth, the oils found in ground coffee emulsify with the water passing through, leaving a rich, syrupy, concentrated drink that is categorized into three layers: the crema, which provides aroma and the first layer of flavor; the body, which gives primary flavor and texture; and the heart, which gives the espresso depth.
Although it’s not hard to make great espresso, it does take training and expensive equipment. The problem is most places that serve espresso drinks have neither.
Even with its new manual-operation espresso machine, Ground Zero — as good as its milkshakes are — simply doesn’t put out a consistently good espresso. The shots tend to be watery, with a weak crema that disappears quickly, which can drag down the quality of the espresso drink, whether it’s a plain latte or mocha or anything else. One thing that is neat, however, is their vast selection of syrups and interesting drink combinations, as well as the fact that they free-pour their steamed milk — more on that later.
If Ground Zero’s espresso shots are mediocre, then Trojan Grounds’ are pitiful. The fully automatic Schaerer espresso machines — used commonly in Starbucks and those “proudly brewing” Starbucks — puts potential shots at a disadvantage. Because espresso shots require such specific, individual attention, a barista would ideally use a manual grinder and extractor to craft each pull.
But the Schaerer machines’ disadvantage lies in their inability to automatically adjust the grind of the beans according to changes in humidity and temperature.
In addition to its sub-par espresso techniques, TroGro is usually busy, and its employees are not competition-ready baristas, meaning the drinks come out inconsistently. Huge blunder, too, is the heavy application of all things syrupy, especially the insane amount of caramel sauce in the caramel macchiato, all of which sinks to the bottom of the cup to form a viscous yellow mass.
The milk at TroGro is also abused. Supposedly “steamed to perfection” by the auto-machines, it is instead tortured past 160 degrees Fahrenheit, which leaves it tasting watery and scalded instead of creamy and rich with a light sweetness. And instead of a thick, tight foam that’s incorporated with the coffee to provide a gently flavored textural garnish, the foam at TroGro looks like unhappy soap suds, scooped on top of insipid coffee.
In stark, beautiful contrast to this mess lies the best coffee on or anywhere near campus — Shop Café, which sits off a courtyard at the USC School of Architecture. There, behind the counter, sits a gleaming — and expensive — fully manual La Marzocco espresso machine. Next to it are adjustable grinders with local, fresh Kéan Coffee beans. And, most importantly, the cafe is staffed by baristas who know what they are doing. All of these factors add up to great espresso drinks.
Shop Cafe’s latte doesn’t need any frills. The coffee and milk strike a brilliant harmony that is deep and delicate at the same time. The steamed milk is expertly free poured straight from the pitcher, which combines the milk and foam together with the coffee instead of leaving a scooped pillow of milky air lonely on top. And if you would like flavors, they’ve got them, including a good selection of premium Monin syrups as well as Ghirardelli chocolate and caramel sauces. And their prices are perfectly competitive with any other store.
Sure, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf has a unique menu and great blended drinks, and Tutor Hall Café and The Lot have acceptable espresso drinks as well, but Shop Café is the shining example of what kind of coffee three bucks should be able to get you. And whether you’re drinking it for taste or for energy, shouldn’t you be getting your money’s worth?
Great article!  I can’t wait to go to Shop Cafe.  Well done and cheers.

For doctors who travel abroad to help save lives, it certainly should not be considered in bad taste for them to smile. But some doctors who looked a little too happy in the pictures they posted on Facebook have turned a humanitarian mission aimed to aid Haitian earthquake victims into a major embarrassment and political nightmare.
These medical staffers probably should have thought twice about saying cheese, especially considering the compromising nature of the moments these photos captured — doctors swigging alcohol, mugging for cameras and brandishing firearms — all the while surrounded by the devastated country.
Despite the tragedy that has consumed the country during the earthquake and its aftermath, there are still small triumphs that give Haitians and international volunteers cause for joy.
When Elizabeth Josaint, a three-week-old infant who was trapped and buried for a week in the rubble of the quake, was found alive in the collapsed remnants of her home, her mother and the child’s rescuers found reason to smile. Elizabeth’s mother, Michelin Josaint, said all she could do was give thanks to God, who she credits with protecting her baby.
Others can be found grinning despite the tears streaming down their faces; despite losing a roof over their heads or a place to sleep, these people can take solace in the fact that they’ve been given a new lease on life.
But in the context of the doctors who waved guns and flashed toothy grins, the smiling and seemingly celebratory mood is unwarranted and inappropriate.
These doctors are not jovial because of the knowledge that they will save lives. Rather, these medical staffers acted carelessly and without sensitivity to the suffering that was happening right around them.
Oftentimes the suffering was even on display within the photographs — as witnessed by the small, nearly naked boy cowering behind a doctor in scrubs who is raising up two bottles of brew in an ignorant toast.
Now, it shouldn’t be mandatory for volunteers to submit to the gloom and sulk that surrounds them during relief projects. All the scenario calls for is a level of sensitivity — while volunteers are encouraged to remain optimistic while providing aid, they must draw a line in order to pay respect to the lives taken by the tragedy.
The mere fact that these doctors were flown overseas for the purpose of saving lives should indicated to them that the needs of the victims should have been their first priority. Their noble efforts to help in the relief efforts should not place them on a pedestal above criticism.
It was not wrong for these doctors to crack a smile; the tragedy is that these photos now serve as a concrete example of how the doctors actively chose to waste valuable time. They could have used the time spent guzzling scotch to save a boy who was bleeding to death from a head injury sustained during the earthquake or to assist a would-be mother struggling through childbirth despite her own life-threatening ailments.
Another troubling question of causation arises by observing the military in the photographs — why would soldiers give their guns to untrained civilians? Those involved on the medical staff as well as the military need to be disciplined because it is this disrespect and lack of judgment that detracts from the honorable efforts of many to provide real hope through medical care in Haiti.
Beyond tarnishing their own credibility and that of the mission, some of these same doctors compromised the privacy of patients by taking photos of victims in hospital beds. The doctors disrespected the victim’s vulnerable state and snapped a photo of the patient who was naked from the waist down except for a thin strip of cloth covering the genitals.
Because this particular mission was coordinated by Puerto Rico’s Senate, the embarrassment for the government is even more sensitive. Some of these doctors have already been fired and the repercussions of these careless acts are sure to follow them throughout their medical careers.
Though it is disappointing that such an event transpired, we can’t put all of this blame on the doctors, as human nature dictates that those in the most stressful of situations probably deserve some sort of down time.
The only way we will be able to provide Haitians with constant support is through a groundswell of participation from many individuals who make a personal commitment to contribute to the relief effort.
Whether this personal commitment is to assemble a first aid kit in a zip-close bag or to travel to Haiti and provide firsthand care, it is through bold efforts such as these that a worldwide network of volunteers will be able to help Haiti rise from the rubble.
Despite incidents such as these, the crisis in Haiti has proven that, even in the midst of tragedy, there is still cause for joy. The people of Haiti are giving thanks for the small series of miracles that unexpectedly saved a few homes, churches and orphanages.
These buildings that stand confidently above the rubble serve as a sign of hope, as a sign of the faith Haitians harbor that the aid of both time and caring volunteers will guide Haiti as it starts down the long road to repair.

Agree with your comments. 
These further details have been reported locally in PR regarding these doctors: (1) apparently only the pictures with earthquake vistims were taken in Haiti, the rest appear to have been taken in the Dominican Republic, when these fellows were on their way back to their homes; (2) their apologies ran almost immediatly on the most prominent pages of the local newspapers in Puerto Rico; (3) folks in PR were distrubed and disgusted by the lack of civility by taking such pictures with the victims.

With His season over and about to go under the knife for knee surgery, Mark Sanchez is still making an impact on the national scene, this time in support of a charitable contest for the NFL.
The NFL’s Pepsi Refresh Project pits the ex-Trojan against Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Cowboys defensive lineman DeMarcus Ware as they all compete for a $100,000 grant from Pepsi to support the charity of their choosing.
Sanchez has chosen the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which sponsers and funds research into type 1 or early-onset diabetes, usually diagnosed in children under the age of 18.
Sanchez’s goal for his donation would be to fund early detection programs for the incurable disease and allow for prompt treatment.
You can vote for any of the three contestants at the NFL website (link), or by text message, by texting “MARK” “DEMARCUS” or “DREW” to 73774. The text message is free of charge.
Brees is competing for the American Cancer Society and Ware is attempting to raise the grant for Jonathon’s Place, a charity that benefits Dallas-area child-abuse victims.
The contest ends Feb. 5 at midnight.

Bernanke’s reconfirmation a mistake
In these times of economic hardship and uncertainty, many people have become increasingly aware of an inconspicuous institution known as the Federal Reserve. Despite the recent attention the Fed has been receiving, most people still have little or no understanding of what the Fed does or how it affects our daily lives. This is an enormous cause for concern due to the controversy surrounding the re-nomination of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
Today the media touts Bernanke as a modern day hero who, in the face of adversity, took drastic measures to stave off the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. This belief, however, is not only unfounded but is also lacking comprehension of fundamental economics.
In the wake of the crisis that unfolded in late 2008, Bernanke cut interest rates to near zero and flooded the market with trillions of dollars in easy money all in the name of helping out struggling companies and debtors. These actions, much to our dismay, are the exact measures enacted by former Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan during the stock market crash in the early 2000s. The only difference is that Bernanke committed these fallacies on a much larger scale; at least Greenspan kept interest rates near 1 percent.
The result of Greenspan’s actions, as we all know, was the housing crisis that led to many of America’s top financial institutions either going bankrupt or being declared financially distressed. This is supported by the fact that all of the risky and predatory lending taking place during the build up of the housing bubble was made possible by the historically low interest rates. There never would have been adjustable rate mortgages, or option ARMs, if rates had remained higher. What made these mortgages attractive was that they offered low, teaser rates that made it appear as if low-income borrowers could afford the payments but did not consider the effects of what would happen when they rise. Once rates did start rising the house of cards came tumbling down, and borrowers began defaulting.
Now we find ourselves in an unprecedented situation with rates lower than ever and the economy in even worse condition. The government now owns a number of Fortune 500 companies, and there are many more deemed “too big to fail.”
Bernanke pulled out all the stops to prevent this last downturn from being too severe, while never addressing the fundamental problems that created the crisis in the first place. The dilemma now is that if another downturn is to occur the Federal Reserve will basically be left with no more tools to fight it off; after all, rates can’t be lowered below zero — or can they? The only thing the Fed can do at that point would be to print money, which would inevitably lead to an equally grave and debilitating currency crisis.
I’m not saying that if the Fed had raised rates and let large companies go bankrupt, we would all be fine and dandy. We would, however, already be on the path to recovery since entrepreneurs would have been able to buy the assets of those companies for pennies on the dollar and make them profitable, ultimately sparking job creation.
Chairman Bernanke has done nothing more than make sure all of the factors that allowed this crisis to occur persist into the future, with the taxpayer flipping the bill. So is Ben Bernanke’s re-nomination something to be lauded by all? Not by those of us who have an idea of the road ahead

Monogamy is human nature
The question raised at the end of Jean Guerrero’s article (“Human
nature to blame for scandals” Jan. 31, 2010)  is: “Is one [either a monogamy or polyamorist lifestyle] really more noble, natural, or reasonable than the other?” The question was raised and it invites a response.  Here goes…
Let’s first address whether one is more natural than the other.  As Ms. Guererro presented it, it seems that one lifestyle is natural while the other isn’t natural at all.  Why?  It seems that the polyamorists have confused an unnatural inclination for a natural one, and have completely disregarded the true natural inclination.  I do not think that it is a natural inclination for humans to have more than one partner, but it is a natural inclination for them to have a sexual instinct.  There is a difference.  What the polyamorists have done is arbitrarily equated a sexual desire and a desire to have more than one partner.
Moreover, it is precisely our natural inclination to be jealous (in such matters as these) that protects and safe guards our natural inclination to desire sex.  Our jealousy is the “no” which points us to a greater “yes” namely, one sexual partner.  In reality, the natural inclination to have more than one partner does not exist.
Next, let’s consider if one is more reasonable than the other.  Guerrero states that “evolutionary theory” supports the idea that in early human history, babies needed two guardians (man and woman) so that they could survive (i.e., not be eaten by wolves).  She then goes on to say that because we no longer need to protect our children from dangers such as wolves, humans have evolved in such a way that we desire more than one partner (i.e., more than one other guardian).  However, this whole evolutionary process seems backward to me.
Doesn’t it make more sense that we would have evolved in a way that resulted in more partners (and therefore guardians) during a time in which the threat (wolves) was greater?  And doesn’t it make more sense that the evolutionary process would lead to a monogamy lifestyle as the threat became less (today)?  However, the polyamorists argue the exact opposite of what makes logical sense leading me think that it is unreasonable.  I argue that the polyamorists have made up the fact that evolution has anything to do with the issue.  I mean, what evolutionary theory argues the facts that they propose and where can it be found?
Simply, a monogamous lifestyle existed then, because it is the natural inclination.

Amid all the news about the State of the Union address and the faltering health care bill, a lot of foreign policy news has slipped under the radar, including one event that could dramatically affect U.S.-China relations for the next decade. It is serious, dangerous to international relations and somewhat illogical.
Recently, the United States authorized a $6.4 billion weapon sale to Taiwan. In response, China has threatened to impose sanctions and to withdraw from any military exchanges with the United States. Even the state-run media has taken the initiative, criticizing the United States. The China Daily claimed that the arms sale “inevitably cast a long shadow on Sino-U.S. relations.”
This sudden anger over arms sales is new for China. Although the United States officially recognized the People’s Republic in the 1970s, it has continued to supply weapons to Taiwan ever since. Arms sales to Taiwan are not new. So why would China be so angry?
China has been claiming Taiwan as part of its territory for years and reunification, be it diplomatic or militaristic, has long been part of its policy. Arms sales to Taiwan present a problem for China, even if China’s military vastly outnumbers its island neighbor’s.
It’s not the why, but the how of China’s reaction that is most vexing. Sanctions on the United States? Why would a rapidly developing nation try to hurt the economy of one of its biggest trading partners? China and the United States are inextricably linked; China is major buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds, while the United States is a major client of Chinese economy. Halting free trade between the two is detrimental to both sides, and China should know that.
It is not as if U.S.-China relations are strong right now. The recent mess over Google brought China’s Internet censorship to light and angered the United States. Add in the ever-present human rights issues with China, and the two nations are not exactly super friendly.
Ultimately, it seems that China is just flexing its muscles. The global recession is over, and recovery is beginning, and China feels like the time is right to assert its power. While it took a blow in the recession, China still had a positive growth. It is an economic powerhouse, possesses one of the strongest militaries in the world and, unlike its competitors, came out of last year’s mess relatively ahead.
Since China is in a relatively good position in the world, it would seem as if it would be trying to court international powers. This move, however, only threatens international security and trade. More than likely, this is just going to earn China the ire of the other members of the United Nations and possibly some counter threats of sanctions on China.
Still, for all of China’s claims and threats, it is most likely that the deal will ultimately go through. China is a major power in the 21st century, and knows it, and that means knowing when to not spoil a good deal. The U.S.-Sino ties, both economic and political, are too important for either country to do something so stupid.
China forced its hand and came out looking impulsive. The arms sale might or might not be right, but China’s reaction to it clearly displays a naïveté and arrogance in its place within the international community. While it might not like Taiwan increasing its arms, a few more Taiwanese ships are less threatening to China than trade barriers and more enemies. So in this case, China should just let trade go through and reap the benefits of free commerce in the global community.
China’s arrogance might stem from its strength in the world, but if it keeps up this blustering foreign policy, it may do more harm in the long run. Being a rich nation doesn’t take much wisdom, but being a powerful nation does.

The chinese know that we are screwed economically, they just want to give that extra little push to start the snowball effect.
We owe alot of money to them, in fact…. the national debt now is so bad that it is impossible to pay back, perhaps what people dont understand its not a matter of “IF” but rather a matter of “WHEN” the US will declare bankrupcy.
By impossible to repay i mean…. if we were to confiscate every penny of US currency from every single bank, business and citizen and use it to repay debt, we would still be highly in debt, not to mention destroy the economy.

“Even though he is a poor writer, but he has great potential as a freshman majoring in print journalism.”
Huh? 
So who is the poor writer? What is that sentence supposed to mean?
We got an expert on Sino-US relation, arm sales, cross-strait situation, world trade, and UN community. Even though he is a poor writer, but he has great potential as a freshman majoring in print journalism.

Last weekend I broke down a wall, crossed the line, got a life and came out.
And from these activities I learned to break the habit of stereotyping, cross over my comfort zone, live in the “real world” and be supportive of someone who is coming out to their family and friends. I acquired all these priceless lessons at a retreat with my The Process of Paraprofessional Counseling for Young Adults (EDCO 030x) course, the class students who want to be R.A.s are required to take. 
The class and retreat provide valuable knowledge and insight into different cultures, religions and races; however, unlike a typical class, students teach each other about their backgrounds and beliefs with the guidance and encouragement of the instructors. And in this open and free environment, I learned about Chinese symbols, black history, Jewish customs and Czech surnames.
This experience was unlike any general education class that focuses solely on one background or culture, as I got to learn a little bit about several. That’s not to say the instructors’ role in the class should be undermined, because they teach us theories and methods that help steer and facilitate our opportunity for personal growth.
As part of the curriculum, the teachers present ideas developed by theorists that directly address students’ transition into college life. In fact, some of the theories are so dead on, they could have predicted my initial experiences and struggles within the college setting before I arrived at USC, which could have prevented a whole lot of emotional stress, or at least given me a heads up.
The theories themselves do not signify the relevance of the class though; rather they engage students’ ability to consider these ideas and use them as tools to personally develop and successfully continue their journey through college.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Now that the retreat is over and I have returned to USC with a greater desire to learn with respect for those around me, the class has taken a turn and we are moving on — from focusing on our personal identities to helping others cope with and maintain their own. Counseling is a major part of the course, and, although it is generally intended for helping residents, it is useful information that students can utilize to help their friends work through issues or troubles. The class also informs students about go-to organizations on campus that can also provide assistance, such as the counseling services at the University Park Health Center.
Based on my personal experience, I believe the course should be a general requirement course for all USC students. I’ve dived into one class from each general education category and none offer the necessary applications to daily life that this class does.
Because of EDCO, I am a more tolerant human being and work toward understanding the differences and similarities of people from diverse backgrounds.
Another engaging aspect of the class is that it is taken for credit rather than an actual letter grade. That way, students can learn without being tested on their knowledge because each person takes away something different from the course. Nevertheless, the class does not fill any major or GE requirements, so it’s only worth elective units, which might be a turn off to students.
Although I didn’t believe it after hearing it, EDCO students end up becoming very close with their classmates. We have learned so much about each other that it’s hard not to bond and find comfort in our peers’ stories and experiences. Thus, this class is also a good option for students, especially freshmen who are shy and find difficulty meeting new friends.
Neither my astronomy nor my philosophy class could provide me with the applicable and relevant information this class provides. In addition, despite the choice of about 116 GE courses offered each semester, I usually take the classes that fit my overall schedule, which removes all the intrigue of picking out courses of interest.
Most classes are usually full before I register, and others are offered at hours that conflict with my other courses. So those who argue that students have the ability to choose their GEs are wrong. Of the six categories I have signed up for, I was only able to pick one of them. My social issues GE did somewhat acknowledge and support diversity, but my EDCO class truly hits the points home.
Each GE class is designed to keep students well versed in a variety of subject areas and to help guide those without a solid feel for future career paths. I could have told you from the get-go, however, that I would not become a philosophy or science major. Regardless of one’s vocational interests, the value of EDCO shines through and has the ability to change our campus culture positively.
Danielle Nisimov is a sophomore majoring in public relations.  Her column “On the SCene “ runs Thursdays.
I still have fond memories of when I took the EDCO class my second semester at USC.  I served as an RA the following year, but the skills learned from the EDCO class and my year as an RA have served me very well in my career.

The crosstown UCLA-USC rivalry always packs any stadium where the Bruins and Trojans meet.
Whether it is football, basketball or even water polo, the schools know how to bring their fans to their sporting events.
This year, however, the two schools will have a new venue to try and fill up, even if its only for one day.
On February 28, Dodger Stadium will hold a one-day event called the “Dodgertown Classic,” which will feature the USC and UCLA baseball teams squaring off at the historic MLB stadium.
The Dodgers Dream Foundation, which provides “educational, athletic and recreational opportunities for the youth of the Greater Los Angeles community,” created the event as a fundraiser for the baseball team’s affiliate charity.
Oklahoma State and Vanderbilt will also  send teams from out of state to participate in the event, and the two schools will play before the marquee matchup between UCLA and USC.
All the games will count towards the four teams’ regular season records.
Tickets can be purchased online, at either school’s campus box offices for $5, or at Dodger Stadium the day of the event for $10.
Fans will also be presented with the option of buying reduced-price tickets for the Dodgers’ UCLA- or USC-themed nights, where the first 20,000 fans in attendance will receive Dodger hats with either the UCLA or USC colors.
USC night is April 29, while UCLA night is April 30.

Beach cruisers are already a common sight around campus, but a new initiative proposed by a member of the city council could make bikes a common sight all around the city.
For rent · The city’s proposed bike sharing program could allow students to rent bikes to use around campus and around Los Angeles. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
The Los Angeles City Council and the Metropolitan Transit Authority are working on developing a bike-sharing program that would focus on USC and several other locations. The program’s aim is to provide L.A. residents with another option for transportation beyond driving.
“We’re looking at the ‘first mile-last mile’ dilemma in L.A.,” said Cris Liban, the Environmental Compliance and Services Department manager at MTA. “[That] first mile to get on a bus stop and last mile where people need to go from the bus — it’s causing problems.”
The program was first proposed by the MTA in 2008 but was put on the back burner because of a lack of funding. Now, City Councilwoman Jan Perry has brought the issue back into the spotlight, and the city’s Transportation Committee is looking into bike-sharing opportunities.
“I’m looking at the model from Paris, and some other models,” Perry said. “To me, the model that may work best is very similar to the ZipCar [at USC]; something without a lot of infrastructure and downtime.”
So far, Liban said, the idea has been a hard sell among potential advertisers.
“From some of the discussions we’ve had with advertisers, they’re not really warm and fuzzy about having it [in L.A.],” Liban said.
Perry said she has discussed the possibility of running the program on a smaller scale as a more attractive option to investors.
“Maybe just [implement the program] in the 9th District to start, and we’ll show the rest of the city what we can do,” Perry said. “For some people the bicycle is a primary mode of transportation, so it gives us an opportunity here.”
A similar program is already in place at the UC Irvine. There, a bike-sharing program called ZotWheels allows students to rent bikes for up to three hours. The program charges a $40 annual fee for unlimited use.
“We set out to create another alternative mode of transportation for students, faculty and staff,” said Lynn Harris, a planning and project manager at UCI Parking and Transportation. “All of our campuses are trying to reduce emissions and traffic.”
Harris cited exercise and time-saving opportunities as other benefits of bike sharing, in addition to sustainability.
MTA plans to talk with the city’s Transportation Committee about possible stations in urban areas such as USC, Downtown, Koreatown and Hollywood.
“Will this work in L.A.?” Liban said. “We don’t know.”
Though plans for the program are still very tentative, some students said they would welcome a bike-sharing initiative near campus.
“I think the program is a great idea, it’s been done in a couple [of] other cities, and I know it’s been successful,” said Emily Smith, a senior majoring in business administration-cinema television. “L.A. has major transportation problems, so it could help out.”
This is a good idea, but before it can be effective, LA needs some decent, well marked bike lanes throughout the city. I myself own a bike, but I would not dare ride it amid traffic in most places. People are not going to use a bike share program if they do not feel safe biking in the first place.
When I went to Paris, the bike sharing system they had all around the city was awesome. It was fun, easy, cheap, and significantly time efficient. I think because bikes are already so widely used around USC and southern california, LA is a perfect place for a bike sharing program to flourish.

The first swarm of newly admitted students will soon descend upon campus, hoping to make just as strong of an impression as the school hopes to have on them.
Later this month, the applicants selected as finalists for Trustee and Presidential scholarships will visit USC to interview for the awards. About 20,000 students applied for Trustee and Presidential scholarships this year and, of those, about 5.5 percent of the pool — 1,100 people — were selected as finalists, according to Tim Brunold, associate dean and director of undergraduate admission,
“The hardest part of the process is being named a finalist,” Brunold said. “Once that’s happened, they can relax and be themselves.”
The Trustee scholarship pays a student’s full tuition, and the Presidential scholarship pays half. The required interviews for both are conducted at Explore USC sessions held in late February and early March.
Scholarship applicants who make the cut are selected as finalists for either the Trustee or the Presidential scholarship. The awards are not guaranteed, however, and much hinges on the interview. Trustee finalists could instead be given the Presidential scholarship and Presidential finalists could earn the Trustee.
The percentage of scholarship interviewees who don’t receive a scholarship varies from year to year, Brunold said, but the number is typically low.
Brunold said the interviews are critical in distinguishing among equally qualified applications.
“Based on average test scores or GPA or class rank, you would see very little difference on paper,” Brunold said. “It’s about the things that aren’t easily tallied or counted up. We look at the entire person.”
The admissions office selects candidates for scholarship consideration from the pool of scholarship applicants, Brunold said, and then the individual schools pick the scholarship finalists who are brought to campus for interviews.
A panel consisting of one staff member, one faculty member and one student from the applicant’s prospective school typically conducts the interview. Karen Rowan-Badger, assistant dean of USC College admissions, said the interviews generally last around 20 minutes.
The number of accepted students varies among the different schools and is based on the school’s size and enrollment. The Roski School of Fine Arts, for example, only gives out about 10 or 12 Trustee and Presidential scholarships each year because the school is so small relative to USC’s other schools, Roski Dean Ruth Weisberg said.
To be selected as a Trustee scholar at Roski, Weisberg said, students need a great academic record and an outstanding portfolio. But, she noted, there are more to the scholarships than pure academics.
“The panel looks to see how passionate [students] are about their chosen path,” Weisberg said. “We look for maturity and poise. On top of talent and academic qualifications, the interview adds another ingredient.”
Rowan-Badger added that the interview process was a big part in giving the school an idea about students that applications can’t.
“[We’re looking] just for students to be themselves,” Rowan-Badger said. “We’ve met them ‘on paper’ through the application, but it’s a time for the student to really shine.”
Ultimately, USC hopes to enroll about 140 Trustee scholars and somewhere between 300 and 350 Presidential scholars in the incoming freshman class. One hundred and fifty Presidential scholarships will be given out through the interview process and the rest would be awarded to National Merit finalists who have picked USC as their first choice school.
Many other applicants will be selected for other scholarships, including the Dean’s scholarship, a quarter-tuition award, and the Associates scholarship.
These numbers are slightly higher than last year’s, Brunold noted, but not significantly.
“We’re currently not cutting into scholarships, and that’s important to us,” Brunold said. “We’re always trying to award more.”
The funding for these scholarships, he said, comes from the university’s financial aid budget.
Though the number of scholarships has remained relatively stable, Brunold said the process of choosing the individuals who receive scholarships has become more and more difficult, as the number of applicants has increased.
Students who apply for a Presidential or Trustee scholarship but are not selected as finalists are placed back in the applicant pool for regular admission.
Brunold said the matriculation rate is likely to be similar to previous years — about 45 percent of Trustee candidates and about 28 percent of Presidential candidates ended up attending USC.
Brunold said requiring the scholarship finalists to visit the school helps secure their attendance.
“The Explore programs are well-attended,” Brunold said. “We know that when we can get them to campus and show them the great things we have to offer, it makes the decision process a lot easier.”
