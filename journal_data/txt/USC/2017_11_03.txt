After a full week of dealing with the fallout from Notre Dame, head coach Clay Helton was happy to hand out plenty of praise following USC’s bounce-back victory at Arizona State last week.
“Maybe our best team effort all away across the board,” Helton said after the Trojans’ 48-17 blowout over the Sun Devils, in which they torched ASU for 607 yards on offense.
As usual, USC relied heavily on the run, but the team opened up a big lead early thanks to a handful of big passing plays. The Trojans saw on film how aggressively the Sun Devil cornerbacks were pressing, and they employed a simple game plan through the air: Go deep.
“The plan was to try to throw it over their heads and back them off,” Helton said. “Whether we hit them or not, we thought it was going to be important.”
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold executed the strategy to perfection, and redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns hauled in close to half of Darnold’s 266 passing yards and caught two of his three touchdown passes. It was a career night in every way for the wideout: Vaughns’ six catches tied a career high for the third straight week, and his 126 yards, two scores and 42-yard touchdown reception were all personal bests.
The big night was a long time coming. After beginning the season sharing a spot on the depth chart with redshirt freshman Josh Imatorbhebhe and freshman Randall Grimes, Vaughns shot up the ranks as he quickly developed a rapport with Darnold. Vaughns has emerged as one of his quarterback’s favorite targets.
“Tyler has been a big part to the passing game for a while now,” Darnold said. “I think the way he works and the fact that every single play [he assumes] the ball is coming to him is huge. That’s a really great mentality to have as a receiver.”
Vaughns frankly had no reason to assume a throw was coming his way on his second touchdown reception. Reminiscent of Darnold’s snipe through triple coverage in last season’s Rose Bowl, Vaughns caught a laser beam late in the second half while sandwiched between three defenders and taking an illegal hit to the head to stretch USC’s lead to 25 points.
Offensive coordinator Tee Martin described his disbelief in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.
“It’s a pick, it’s a pick, it’s a pick,” he remembered muttering aloud during the play. “No, it’s a touchdown!”
Vaughns had only found the end zone once in his college career before his two-score effort in Tempe, when he hauled in a 37-yard pass against Oregon State. But last Saturday also marked the fifth straight game he had recorded at least five receptions and 65 yards, and his career night quietly pushed him ahead of redshirt senior wideout Steven Mitchell Jr. as USC’s second-leading receiver with 478 yards on the season.
Now, as the Trojans pursue their first Pac-12 championship in nearly a decade, Vaughns will be one of Darnold’s central weapons alongside Burnett and the running back duo of junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr. Vaughns’ breakout — if he can sustain it — might just lift a receiving corps that never seemed to recover from the departure of wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster.
When reporters questioned his options on opening day, Darnold insisted he just needed time to develop trust with his young wideouts. He steadfastly maintained his stance as the season went on, through every miscommunication and every interception. Perhaps Vaughns’ second-quarter score last weekend was the tipping point Darnold had long been waiting for.
“That was the moment that I felt [Darnold] trusted [Vaughns] to that next level,” Martin said, “like the Deontay throw in the Rose Bowl.”

The No. 6 women’s soccer team (14-2-1) looks to close its Pac-12 season on a high when it travels to take on No. 5 UCLA (14-2-2) on Friday night.
The Bruins last played Sunday afternoon against No. 22 Cal, downing the Golden Bears 1-0 at home. The game was an even affair throughout a majority of the match until a goal in the 57th minute by freshman forward Ashley Sanchez — her fifth of the season — gave the Bruins the lead. The Bruins dominated the Golden Bears in shots and shots on target 18-9 (7-2) and forced the Cal goalkeeper to make eight saves. 
The Bruins are led in offense by Sanchez — who also has eight assists — and junior forward Hailie Mace, who has 13 goals and three assists this season. Although they are the main offense threats for the Bruins this season, UCLA also boasts five other players who have at least five combined goals and assists. 
The Bruins have been an offensive machine this season, scoring 42 goals while only conceding 13 in 18 games.  In comparison, the Trojans have scored 31 goals while giving  up 12. The Trojans’ defense will have to be aware throughout the game, since the Bruins have been free-scoring all season, scoring 3 or more goals in seven games this year. 
The Trojans continue to be led in scoring by redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony, who has 7 goals and two assists this season. She is assisted by freshman phenom midfielder Savannah DeMelo, who has 4 goals and five assists. However, the player to watch for the Trojans is sophomore midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre, who has been on fire recently, scoring 2 goals in the past three games, including a wonder-strike against Cal. The Trojans will have to continue their scoring form against UCLA and shake off a tough loss to No.1 Stanford in order to finish the season strong.
These past two games and the upcoming matchup against UCLA will provide a lot of information about the current situation of the Trojans and how they compare to other top national powerhouses as the postseason draws closer. 
This sentiment was echoed by head coach Keidane McAlpine. 
“The UCLA game, as we move in the postseason are great barometers for who we are and where we are,” McAlpine said. 
This upcoming matchup should be a very even affair, as both USC and the Bruins recently played a common opponent in the Golden Bears at their respective home fields, with the teams winning 1-0 in both instances. The Trojans and Bruins both put up similar offensive numbers against Cal, outshooting the Golden Bears in both games. 
Although the Pac-12 crown is already out of reach for the Trojans due to their loss to Stanford, the runner-up position is still up for grabs, with the Trojans currently holding a 3-point advantage over the Bruins. The winner of Friday’s game will take home city bragging rights for the next year. 
With a win, the Trojans will solidify their second-place finish in the Pac-12 and present a strong case to regain entry into the top five of the national rankings. With the postseason fast approaching, a win against an equally talented UCLA team will give the Trojans the boost needed to start a defense of their national championship title.

The No. 17 USC women’s volleyball team (16-7, 8-4 Pac-12) is back home after four straight away matches. On Friday, the Trojans host Arizona State, and on Sunday, they host Arizona.
“This weekend we’re looking to have great games versus both Arizonas,” junior libero Victoria Garrick said. 
Last time the Women of Troy faced off against these two teams, they split their games. Out in Tucson, USC was stunned in a straight-sweep against the Wildcats (25-23, 25-17, 26-24). The team bounced back and picked up a four-set win in Tempe against the Sun Devils (19-25, 25-19, 25-20, 25-22). 
“We’re very excited for the Arizona game because they swept us,” Garrick said. “We were completely caught off guard. I don’t think we expected to lose the game, let alone get swept.”
This time around, the Women of Troy will have home court advantage. As the Pac-12 is arguably the toughest conference for women’s volleyball, wins on the home court are vital. USC has fared well at the Galen Center: it has a home record of 6-1. The Trojans’ only loss at home was against then-No. 3 Stanford. Now the Cardinal has jumped up to No. 2 in the rankings. 
In its last four matches, USC has gone 2-2. Its offense has been missing a key component in sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who has been sidelined. 
In the team’s matches in Washington, freshman outside hitter Brooke Botkin continued to impress. Botkin had 30 kills on the weekend, a team high. She put up two aces and 18 digs. 
Rounding out the other side of USC’s attack are senior opposites Brittany Abercrombie and Niki Withers. The two combined for 52 kills in the team’s last two outings. 
“I know that [the Wildcats] should be a little frightened,” Garrick said. “We’re ready to get up for that match and really put the hammer on them.”
To pick up two wins against the Arizona schools, the Women of Troy will need to rely on Botkin, Abercrombie and Withers. They’ll also need a resurgence of offensive strength from junior outside hitter Alyse Ford. While Ford did not play against the Huskies, she led the team with 14 kills two days later in their sweep of the Cougars. 
The Sun Devils are led by senior middle blocker Oluoma Okaro. Okaro has 385 kills on the season, averaging 4.48 kills per set. Arizona State’s offense is rounded out by freshman outside hitter Griere Hughes and sophomore outside hitter Ivana Jeremic. Hughes has 226 kills on the season, averaging by 2.94 kills per set. Jeremic has 221 kills on the season, averaging 2.76 kills per set. 
The Wildcats are led by a bevy of young talent. Freshman outside hitter Paige Whipple leads the team with 165 kills on the season, averaging 2.36 kills per set. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Elizabeth Shelton is second on the team with 132 kills on the season, averaging 2.10 kills per set. 
Freshman middle blocker Candice Denny is third on the list. Denny is seventh in the conference with a .356 hitting percentage overall and third in the conference with a .372 hitting percentage in league play. She’s on track to be the first freshman in program history to hit at least .350. 
The Women of Troy will have to limit powerful attacks from the Arizona schools to pick up two more wins at home.

Halfway through their rookie seasons in the NFL, USC’s newest additions to the league are experiencing differing levels of success. Some former Trojans are making a splash in the league, while others are struggling to find the field. 
Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has been experiencing incredible success to date, fitting in seamlessly with the Pittsburgh Steelers in one of the most explosive offenses in the league. Smith-Schuster was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week in his team’s 20-15 win over Detroit for his 193 yards that came on seven catches, including a 97-yard touchdown, which marked the longest passing play in Steelers history. The wide receiver has also been making waves off the field after he posted an Instagram story about his bike being stolen, forcing him to walk to practice. The internet picked up the story and soon #TeamFindJujusBike was trending on Twitter. Building off of his newfound fame, Smith-Schuster celebrated his touchdown on Sunday by running over to his sideline, grabbing a bike lock and locking the bike next to the trainer’s table. 
The bike incident was not the only moment to highlight Smith-Schuster fame, however, as his creative touchdown celebrations including playing hide-and-seek with teammates have earned him notice around the league. He has 424 yards and four touchdowns through eight games, and has recorded at least 30 yards in six of those eight games so far. Smith-Schuster is now the first NFL player to reach three touchdowns before his 21st birthday.
Cornerback Adoree’ Jackson is also finding early success at the next level. He has started all seven games for the Titans as well as commanding punt and kick return duties. He notched three returns of over 40 yards on the season, and flashed his speed and quickness with punt returns of 63 and 80 yards for touchdowns ­— though both were called back for penalties. Jackson has been solid but not spectacular in coverage, and has one forced fumble on the season, coming on a well-timed hit on former Dolphins running back Jay Ajayi. 
One player unable to find instant success is former USC safety, Rose Bowl hero and sixth-round pick Leon McQuay III. McQuay was placed on the Kansas City Chiefs practice squad shortly before the regular season began, and despite an injury to one of the Chiefs’ starting safeties, McQuay has yet to be promoted to the active roster. McQuay does see a familiar face on the practice squad, however, as former USC offensive guard Damien Mama was also signed to Kansas City’s practice squad after he went undrafted in May. Receiver Isaac Whitney is also  on a practice squad, as he was signed by the Oakland Raiders at the beginning of the season. 
Offensive lineman Zach Banner is faring slightly better, landing a spot on the Cleveland Browns after being drafted in the fourth round then waived by the Colts. The offensive tackle is on the active roster but has not played significant minutes. Similarly to Banner, offensive tackle Chad Wheeler has made a roster but is struggling to find the field. He has appeared in four games for the Giants, but remains the backup to starter Ereck Flowers. Another Trojan struggling to find the field is running back Justin Davis of the Los Angeles Rams. His first and only carry of the season came in Week 1, as Todd Gurley’s resurgence has made him dispensable. 
Wide receiver Darreus Rogers was on the move recently, as he was signed on Oct. 6 to the Chicago Bears as a failsafe for their receiving corps. He has not yet been promoted to the active roster, though there is speculation that he will be as Chicago’s receivers have not been performing well.
 Taylor McNamara was waived by the Browns before the regular season began.

Last week, a sexual harassment lawsuit against USC and professor Erick Guerrero went public, and University administrators once again found themselves struggling to offer a response to a media firestorm. 
Karissa Fenwick, a doctoral student at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, filed a lawsuit alleging Guerrero harassed her in his New Orleans hotel room in January. Just this past week, Guerrero’s attorney released a letter saying USC’s Title IX office mishandled the investigation, and Fenwick publicly criticized the University for not sufficiently punishing Guerrero. 
Then, Dworak-Peck jumped into the fray. Sixty-eight of the school’s faculty members sent a letter Saturday expressing their disapproval of the University’s actions in the aftermath of Fenwick’s harassment complaint, and approximately 60 social work students formed a coalition to speak out against the school’s lack of transparency in handling sexual harassment complaints. 
Dworak-Peck was added to the laundry list of USC departments mired in controversy over the last semester — and yet the school’s dean, Marilyn Flynn, offered a refreshing, proactive response that senior administration should aspire to model moving forward. In a letter penned by Flynn last week, the dean urged Dworak-Peck faculty to devote spaces and class time for students to ask questions and express their concerns about Guerrero. 
Her letter addressed a key criticism from students and faculty in her school regarding the Guerrero incident: poor transparency from the senior administration. Flynn demonstrated a willingness to engage with students and faculty members that has yet to be seen from other members of the administration.
Flynn has been instrumental in facilitating much-needed dialogue between students and staff not only through her letter, but also through partaking in a meeting  on Monday with 35 Dworak-Peck doctoral students, along with Martin Levine, the school’s vice provost. Students in attendance said in a letter sent to the Daily Trojan that in the meeting, the dean agreed to publicly acknowledge Fenwick’s harassment claims and also form a committee to review policies within the school that deal with sexual misconduct.
“We are pleased that Dean Flynn has agreed to partner with us in achieving our goal of confronting the unspoken grand challenge of ending sexual misconduct and abuse of power at our University and providing an example of institutional leadership on this issue,” they said in the letter.
Instead of promising ambiguous task forces and holding impersonal town halls — as seen at the Keck School of Medicine of USC following the resignations of the past two deans, and in the Bovard Administration Building after the resignation of a senior administrator — Flynn made honest, tangible suggestions for improvement and met with a small group of students to discuss moving forward. Furthermore, she didn’t just show up to the meeting — she left having made tangible commitments to the students of the school. 
The University’s administration must follow the lead of Flynn and senior faculty at Dworak-Peck, and open up forums to USC students. In a Sunday memorandum to the student body, Provost Michael Quick admitted that he does not have the answers to an issue this nuanced and it is “something we will need to grapple with as a community.” 
Quick has acknowledged that students must be involved in the solution to this greater community issue, but did not detail any plan to include and engage the student body. The next step to acknowledging the need for the administration to reach across the aisle must be to take concrete action. This means senior administrators must host and be present at forums and events, and partner and communicate with student organizations, residence halls and cultural assemblies. Administrators must clearly communicate what resources are available to students who fall victim to harassment, and vocalize their support for all students who are on the receiving end of these abuses of power — as Flynn has done this past week. In the same vein, students must be given opportunities to voice their concerns and ideas for solutions. 
Above all, these forums, meetings and open interactions between students and senior administrators could serve to hold the University accountable to the people it serves, and pressure USC to be more transparent about how it is handling issues of this scope.
USC must make a greater effort to be public and facilitate clear communication about how it investigates these cases, and the rights of both parties when allegations are made. And in order to do this, administrators need leaders like Flynn to be willing to come out and address the problem head-on. Only when students feel safe and respected will they be empowered to come forward and speak truth to power, and only then will there be real change on campus.
Daily Trojan Fall 2017 Editorial Board
Although the dean is now making an effort to facilitate communication about this issue, her initial response was hardly refreshing nor proactive. Refer to her first letter to the SSW dated 10/26 in which she states the case was “handled as an internal, confidential personnel matter. That it how it should be.” She went on to shut down all discussion of the topic on the department listserv that night. Dean Flynn may yet redeem herself going forward. But this one-sided portrayal of her actions to date undermines your credibility as objective journalists. Surely you all can do better.

It’s a turbulent world. Sexual assault allegations are shaking down megastars in the wake of a storm of Harvey Weinstein allegations. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly is now speaking as a Confederate-sympathizing Civil War historian (who knew?). Saturday Night Live thought it could disappear for two weeks and placate me with David S. Pumpkins. 
Be that as it may, I’m still frolicking across campus like Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music at the thought of the most recent Washingtonian developments. That’s right — the Hill is alive with the sound of natural consequences. Mueller and his associates have finally indicted three key members of President Donald Trump’s corrupt, colluding administration — one already having pleaded guilty — and he’s coming for more. So, as the Republicans would prefer it to be said, Merry Christmas. 
In all honesty, though, the only relieving part about the indictments is the intimation that our democratic foundations might actually be preserved by the rule of law. Otherwise, we are only still waiting, and watching. In brief: Mueller brought charges against Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort (how shocking), his business partner Rick Gates and foreign policy adviser to the campaign, George Papadopoulos. 
Papadopoulos has already pleaded guilty to lying about attempts to broker meetings between campaign personnel and Russian officials. He wasn’t indicted in the same sense as Mueller and Gates. Rather, he confessed under seal in accordance with an agreement with prosecutors. His charges related very directly to his multiple Russian contacts, and his information most likely has the potential to incriminate bigger fish. 
The charges against Manafort are probably pursuant to the same goal. To be clear, Mueller’s charges don’t pertain to alleged crimes committed during Manafort’s Trump administration tenure, but just before: Acting as an agent of Ukrainian government and officials, earning tens of millions of dollars doing so, laundering that money through corporate bodies, and lying to the FBI about it. 
It’s not uncommon for these sorts of investigations to bring up unrelated charges to persuade potential witnesses to cooperate. Whether Mueller or Gates will do so certainly falls into the “waiting and watching” category, but one thing’s for sure: These indictments demonstrate to potential witnesses that Mueller is willing to play the long game, and they will lead to more. We can only hope that they will implicate the man standing at the helm, and pay that his island of Misfit Nativists have not, in their efforts to erode the fabric of our democracy, actually been able to orchestrate plausible deniability for him. 
We are getting closer and closer to a day when we won’t have to suffer hordes of blind reactionary groaning at the statement we all know to be true — it looks like Trump colluded with a foreign government to win an election. Call it a witch hunt if you want. Donald Trump Jr. released emails proving he sought to meet with Russian operatives himself, on his own Twitter feed. Numerous independent security firms have published reports calling for reevaluations of electronic voting machines in Wisconsin and Michigan, machines whose owners — private companies like Diebold, with financial ties to the Republican National Committee — refuse to cooperate with investigation.
Manafort, a key Trump adviser, had numerous ties to Russian state operatives, and wasn’t the only one. Campaign personnel Carter Paige and Roger Stone have been implicated; Gen. Michael Flynn resigned to distract from his dealings with Kislyak, who also met with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions then lied about it under oath. Guccifer 2.0, who captivated news cycles for a constant barrage of hacks against the DNC, claimed to be a Romanian independent operative — and yet couldn’t speak colloquial Romanian to an independent Romanian-American tech reporter. He operated on Russian language-based servers almost exclusively during Moscow time. Cry “conspiracy,” these are the facts. Come to your own conclusions. 
I don’t bring all this up only to engage in an early “gotcha.” After all, Mueller’s work is really only beginning. These are his team’s first actions but it is almost certain he does not intend them to be the last. It is to remind voters on this campus that each day, we live under one of the worst American presidents in history who does not lead with the popular mandate and may not even be leading with a legitimate electoral one. 
Republican, Democrat, Green Party, whatever — independent elections are the foundation of this democracy. Without them, the country our founding fathers dreamed of so long ago ceases to exist. We are not a collection of people who only care when the news is on, and forget the next moment. Pay attention to Mueller, and don’t forget what’s going on. Perhaps one day, young people will be asking us later, when the scandal and arrests and convictions and pardons and chaos are all over, what it was like. 
Maybe some of us will be shelving those gauche MAGA hats like a Nixon/Agnew button. In the meantime, I watch Trump spiral out on Twitter, GOP veterans evade the question and traditional conservatives shake their heads at them both. Winter descends on USC, and I sip my hot tea. 
Tread on them, Mueller.

Julianne Torres spent a Saturday in Redmond, Wash., dressed in business formal attire for an interview with Microsoft Corporation, one of the largest technology companies in the world.
Torres, a senior studying computer science who is the president of the Society for Women Engineers, is no stranger to big industry names. She previously interned at Google and Intel.
Torres attributes her success not only to her education, but also to inclusion networks and resource groups like the one she leads, which helped get her foot in the industry door. But, as she prepares to start her post-graduate career, Torres is braced to face the challenges of being a woman in STEM — namely an industry culture that can, to some, be alienating and exclusive.
The Educational Pipeline
Torres said she did not consider pursuing engineering until her senior year of high school.
“When I was growing up, I didn’t have that many STEM programs available,” Torres said. 
Yet, the academic opportunities for women in STEM, specifically engineers, is improving, according to statistics by the American Society for Engineering Education. 
The Viterbi School of Engineering’s 2017 freshman class profile indicated a record-breaking 44 percent of admitted students were female. But in 2016, only 20.8 percent of undergraduate engineering degrees in the United States went to women, while 79.2 went to men.
While the national average of female engineering students stands at 19 percent, there have been increases in those numbers nationwide since the last recorded data in 2007, according to the ASEE.
“In order to make an impact, we have to change everything in all categories,” Viterbi Dean Yannis Yortsos said. “You have to start from K through 12 schools — high school — then undergraduate schools, graduate schools.”
Yortsos called this process the “pipeline process” — an increased focus on educational development for women and underrepresented minorities in the science, technology, engineering and math fields from a young age. He sees this as the solution for the STEM gender gap at USC, for both students and faculty.
The institutional push to bring more women and minorities into STEM fields requires collaboration with educators to implement programs at a young age, Yortsos said. Some female engineering students like Torres, however, do not recall that focus in their high school classrooms.
“My friends and I have said a lot at our SWE events, our outreach events, [that] we would have loved having this when we were younger,” Torres said. “The fact that they exist right now, I think, is a really good step in the right direction.”
As president of SWE, Torres works to advocate for female empowerment in the engineering field by providing outreach activities to encourage the study of STEM among middle and high school students in the South Los Angeles community.
Trina Gregory, a senior lecturer in information technology at Viterbi, received her bachelor’s degree in 1993 and recalled a drastically different workplace and University environment as a woman in tech.
“I didn’t [have any support systems when I started],” Gregory said. “[I] went straight into being a software engineer in a very much male-dominated field … It definitely was that environment back then that the women were generally staff positions, like secretaries, those kind of administrative roles. And the engineers were usually male.”
A Cultural Shift
Data from the National Science Foundation suggests academic retention in STEM is promising, with an 8.2 percent increase in women receiving both master’s and doctorate degrees in engineering from 2004 to 2014.
With the growth of organizations like Women in Computing, Girls in Tech and SWE, Gregory believes these resource groups provide increased support for students, leading to lower drop-off rates from the major.
“When I first came here in 2007, there were still a lot of problems … with [female] retainment,” Gregory said of the computer science program.
Yortsos also emphasized Viterbi’s mentorship integration for female and minority students. Several classes have involved a diverse representation of upperclassmen as teaching assistants for lower-level classes to foster academic growth and inclusion.
In light of the controversy over a Google engineer’s memo about women in tech, as well as sexual harassment claims against Uber and Silicon Valley tech giants, Gregory believes the pipeline strategy is not enough to retain post-graduate women in the field without a change in company culture and in the perception of female engineers.

“A big thing is trying to change the culture that exists,” Gregory said. “You can do all the diversity and inclusiveness [initiatives], but if your environment is the same as it’s always been, then the women aren’t going to stay.”
Workplace retention numbers offer an image of the industry starkly different from increased academic inclusion.
Thirty-nine percent of female engineers leave their jobs at the mid-level point, 10 to 20 years into their career, according to data from a report by The Center for Talent Innovation. Female engineers are also paid 82 percent of their male counterparts’ salaries, statistics from the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey revealed.
The United States Department of Labor estimates there will be over 1.4 million total new computing-related job openings by 2018, when factoring in the industry’s growth and replacement needs.
Torres will be one of many class of 2018 graduates seeking employment next spring; however, company culture and opportunities for growth in the ongoing STEM pipeline will play a role in determining her final decision, she said.
“I do think culture is important and factors into the support you get and the resources at your disposal,” Torres said. “Even outside of having a diverse workplace, culture is something you really can’t change at your job.”
Meanwhile, women outnumber men in college, %58 to %42. Can we start implementing affirmative action for men already? Thank you, bye.

The Gould School of Law has partnered with the Veterans Legal Institute to manage a Los Angeles-based legal clinic that serves veterans.
The VLI is the only legal aid in the country that exclusively helps low-income veterans and members of the military, while operating as a nonprofit organization funded primarily by donations and grants. The institute receives applications from low-income veterans and works to meet their needs. 
“We get approximately 10 applications on a daily basis, over 70 per week,” said Dwight Stirling, the institute’s CEO. “The number of applications we’ve been receiving are on an upward trajectory. We assist every veteran that applies to us.” 
Stirling is a Gould alumnus and said he believes that the collaboration with the law school benefits the surrounding community, as well as USC students. The VLI decided to branch out to Los Angeles due to the larger population of veterans within the city, along with working with USC.
“The partnership between the VLI and the campus is a big deal,” Stirling said. “It allows law students to obtain an educational foundation while helping those that served our country.”
Stirling explained that working with veterans fosters an unparalleled experience for employees and student associates.
“What makes us unique is the fact that we primarily help veterans, and over time, we learn to speak their language,” Stirling said. “When folks come here, they are talking to people that understand them. When they talk to people that understand where they come from, they tend to open up.”
Michael Su, a graduate law student, who worked at the institute over the summer, felt his perspective on the veteran community expanded through his work. 
“The whole point of this partnership is to bring people in so that they can see and engage in a community that they are otherwise disconnected from,” Su said. “There is a real need among the veteran community. It was incumbent on me to use what I know to help a community that I have a very personal connection with.”
Su notes this opportunity exists even for students who aren’t pursuing a formal law school education.
The VLI addresses a wide variety of client interests and works to resolve issues that involve multiple facets of the law. The institute primarily serves young military veterans who are in the process of assimilating to the civilian world. 
“We provide assistance with many complications you would see in the life of a normal young person,” Stirling said. “This includes family law, child support, disputes with employers and issues regarding debt or eviction. These are the low-level civil disputes that young people tend to have, and if they can’t find legal aid, these disputes can develop into larger problems.” 
Despite institutions and practices in place to assist veterans, Stirling believes that the problems manifested today are rooted in systemic failures to seek and preemptively address issues that affect U.S. servicemembers.
“We as a nation are recruiting our young people to serve in the military, and it tends to be people that don’t necessarily have other opportunities,” Stirling said. “They go to the military to gain experience and eventually make use of educational opportunities provided by the GI bill.” 
However, Stirling explained that a number of these servicemembers come from a lower socioeconomic background. Many come back from service faced with residual trauma, he said. 
“They are the tip of the spear on the war on terror, and a lot of our veterans, experience trauma — trauma that you sustain doesn’t go away,” Stirling said. 
PTSD is a common byproduct of exposure to severe trauma without treatment, according to Stirling. Far too often, self-help methods including drugs and alcohol are used in an attempt to alleviate psychological pain. When these methods are employed, many servicemembers fail drug tests, preventing them from receiving an honorable discharge.
The VLI works closely with veterans to petition for a discharge upgrade; such an upgrade is described by Stirling as restorative and redemptive.
Technical matters aside, the VLI provides solace within the veteran community. 
“The most important part of this work is being able to simply listen,” Stirling said. “The veterans that ask for our help often have a very pressing need and are looking for people to hear them out. This is the law at its most basic and fundamental level. Somebody has a problem, and we get to fix it.”
 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that servicemembers that fail drug tests are prevented from receiving an other-than-honorable discharge. Actually, they are prevented from receiving an honorable discharge. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Public speaking can be an important skill for college students, yet there are few classes offered to help develop it. Trojan Speech is an organization dedicated to helping students improve their public speaking skills at USC, and is the only Toastmaster Organization club. Toastmaster is a nonprofit designed to help improve leadership and communication among students. 
“The club is really beneficial in overcoming a public speaking fear … and [becoming] more confident,” said Gozde Barim, president of Trojan Speech. “Mentors and manuals help us be better communicators and better leaders, which is very important to job applications and any career.”
The club meets every Wednesday, with the Toastmaster, the leader of the meeting, introducing speakers and guests. Then, table topics are announced, and people are picked randomly to give impromptu two-minute speeches based on the topic and questions. Afterwards, volunteers give speeches, and the club provides critiques for their improvement.
“We have a new team this year; every last day of the month we have a business team meeting,” Barim said. “In that meeting, table topics are most common interview questions since most of the senior members are about to find jobs or doing interviews with companies. It’s very useful for them to practice the questions over and over again.”      
The club strives to improve its members’ speaking abilities with board members, mentorship programs and area directors available for help. Positions like the Grammarian takes note of the language and word choice in speeches and points out mistakes. Another person keeps track of time to make sure the speech is concise and thorough.
Trojan Speech is part of the worldwide organization Toastmasters International. To join Trojan Speech, students must have a membership with Toastmasters, which can be done online or in-person at Trojan Speech meetings. After joining, students get two manuals — one for leadership and one for communication. Each has instructions for tasks to complete in order to achieve mastery in that subject.
For instance, in the competent communicator manual, the first task, called the Icebreaker, is to prepare a four to six minute-long speech to introduce members to the group. There are a total of 10 speeches a member must complete before reaching the advanced level.
“The other speeches have some objectives you need to fulfill in order to be done with that task,” Barim said. “Some speeches require voice variety, changing your voice tone, some are related to organization, the structure of your speech [and] some have objectives related to [the] content of the speech, whether it is persuasive, informative or humorous.”
Originally, only graduate students could join Trojan Speech, but the organization was opened to all students two years ago. The meetings are open to guests and prospective students, but only members can give speeches or participate in the exercises.
However, Trojan Speech plans to have an open house next semester for anyone interested in the organization. It will hold a sample meeting that will allow non-members to speak and receive feedback.
Barim also plans to hold a speech contest on Nov. 29, Trojan Speech’s last meeting of the semester, which will be open to all USC students. Contestants will give speeches, and the club will evaluate the speech to vote on a winner.

The National Institute of Health’s BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) gave $19 million to the Keck School of Medicine’s Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute to help create a brain cell classification system, according to USC News. 
Their research will aid in understanding the human brain at a cellular level and gain insight into how brain cells and their interactions with each other aid brain function. 
“Once we know how these neurons interrelate, it will facilitate our understanding of what goes wrong in various diseases,” assistant research neurology professor Houri Hintiryan told USC News. 
Specifically, the neuroimaging institute’s research focuses on the anatomy of mouse brains, cataloging different types of mice brain cells based on how they connect with other cells in the brain, and what structures they form with each other, according to USC News. 
The BRAIN Initiative is a broader project launched by former President Barack Obama, which brings together federal agencies with private research institutions, like USC, to help revolutionize the study of the human brain, according to the BRAIN Initiative website.
The USC team is joining the initiative’s Cell Census Network Consortium, a five-year collaboration with a specific focus on identifying and classifying brain cells, USC News said. Although the USC team is focusing on anatomy and structure, other teams in the consortium are tackling the classification through other angles, such as cell function and molecular properties.

Craig Carlson, who graduated from USC in 1992, opened ‘Breakfast in America’ in 2003. Photo by Dominic Davis | Daily Trojan
In Paris, hidden between the outdoor cafes and artisan boulangeries lies a tiny diner called Breakfast in America. It’s a small diner, with retro 1960s booths, movie and television posters plastered all over the walls, toasters on every table and a jukebox in the corner playing Bob Dylan at all hours of the day. You’ve probably seen a diner like this before — in movies, in television shows and even scattered throughout Southern California. But this diner is owned by USC School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Craig Carlson, who moved to Paris first in the late 1990s while he was working on a television show, then permanently in the early 2000s with the idea of creating a “Great American Diner” in Paris. 
Breakfast in America opened in 2003, during one of the heaviest snowfalls Paris had experienced in years. Just a year prior, Carlson was standing in line at the Pantry in downtown Los Angeles, when the idea of opening the diner came to him. 
“When I came back [to Paris], I just wanted breakfast so badly,” Carlson said. “I wanted a big ham steak, and eggs and home fries. I realized it was the one thing I missed. I missed breakfast in America. [Then], I turned to my friends and told them, ‘That’s what I was going to call the diner.’”
But owning a diner was not always Carlson’s dream. He first dreamed of making it big in Hollywood and graduated from the School of Cinematic Arts in 1992 with a master’s degree in the film and television program. After graduating, Carlson worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood but was never given his big break.
 “I worked with Warner Brothers International Television [on a show] called The New Adventures of Robin Hood, and it was a kids’ show,” Carlson said. “I did it for three seasons as post-production supervisor. I wrote an episode that did not get made. It was during this time I realized I wanted to live in Paris. I was tired of the film business, the ups and the downs, and I wanted something different.”
But the path to opening a diner was a long and hard one — which he credits USC for helping him overcome. Early on, Carlson created a preliminary business plan and realized he needed to raise $100,000 on top of the $60,000 he owed in student debt.
 “I started looking for investors and ultimately the USC alumni saved me,” Carlson said. “Out of 30 investors, 20 of them were from the film school. If I didn’t have that, this wouldn’t be here.”

Then, after finding the location for Breakfast in America in the heart of the historic Latin Quarter, the next challenge was recreating the actual aesthetics of an American diner.
“I wanted something that looked like a neighborhood place that had been here for a long time,” Carlson said.
 He found a tiny café within the 5th arrondissement which had been renovated in the ’60s. He stuffed his suitcase with his grandmother’s old belongings, including a transistor radio, and began to decorate the diner, later calling in an interior architect to come recreate the booths and feels of a classic American diner. He also found a way to incorporate his love of film by hanging movie and television posters all over the diner. He uses these posters as a reference for French people to visualize what an American diner is like.
The last big adjustment was the portion sizes. America is notorious for having large portion sizes, just as Paris is for having the opposite. This put Carlson in an awkward situation, as he wanted to make sure his American customers could get the most out of their food without drowning Parisians with syrup and home fries. 
“We had to find a medium,”  Carlson said. “[Parisians] are stunned by the portion sizes. And in the beginning, I would ask if they would like to take it home in a doggie bag, and they would say ‘no’ because it was very gauche to take things home in a doggie bag.” 
Now, all day and all night, the diner serves omelets, bottomless cups of coffee or “joes” with large portions of home fries, along with various types of milkshakes — including one known as the Obama Shake. The diner’s most famous dish of  thick sugary syrup and pancakes is now known by the Parisians as les crêpes américaines.
“The whole first couple of years I had to explain to French people what exactly our breakfast was and how it worked,” Carlson said. “For example, pancakes — the closest thing is a crêpe. Some of my first customers, when I would give them syrup to put on it, they would say, ‘I don’t want sugar on it.’”
But things have slowly begun to change within the City of Lights, as more American influences begin to seep into their culture. Doggie bags are no longer gauche, and hamburgers are beginning to appear all over the menu of even traditional-style Parisian restaurants.
“It used to be your traditional tartare, and now, it starts with an entire burger list and then four or five traditional dishes,” Carlson said. “I had to get over the stereotype.” 
And 15 years later, Carlson is beginning to see how his pact on Parisian culture is slowly taking effect. 
“French customers are now ordering breakfast at all hours,” he said. “They used to do that on Sundays during brunch and occasionally during the week. But after lunch and dinner, never. But just last night I was in here and a customer ordered French toast, omelets, home fries and a bottle of California wine. I thought that was great.”
Now, after the release of his New York Times-bestselling book Pancakes in Paris: Living the American Dream in France (link), along with the book tour that followed, Carlson is optimistic about the future. He toyed with the idea of expanding all throughout Europe, but never quite found the time, as Paris captured most of his attention. 
“I envisioned having diners all over Europe, and the first years after we became popular we got calls from all over Europe,” he said. “But, logically doing business in France took up so much time I couldn’t just run to Madrid and open up a new one.” 
But now, Carlson is open to the idea of expansion in order to share America’s dining culture with the world. He encourages current USC students to take full advantage of the worldwide alumni association available to them and to study abroad for at least one semester. 
“[Studying abroad] opens your mind to the world and is a great way of building perspective,” Carlson said. “It stays with you for the rest of your life.”
And of course, if you’re ever in Paris, stop by if you want a taste of America.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the diner opened in 2003, not 2002. It also incorrectly stated that Carlson found a diner, not a cafe, in the 5th arrondissement. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The celebrations began on Oct. 28 and will continue through Nov. 5. Photo by Natalie Ng | Daily Trojan
This Halloween was about more than just candy at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles. Multiple sections of the park were filled with colorful artworks to honor the dead in the Día de los Muertos Altars + Art celebration. Spanning four city blocks, the exhibit aims to integrate and convey stories and traditions of Angeleno life.
The more than 50 pieces of art in this celebration were curated by a partnership between Self Help Graphics and Lore Productions with a theme focusing on the four elements. Each section of Grand Park exhibits a different display: the space between Grand Avenue and Hill Street features altars by Self Help Graphics as well as local organizations like Mujeres de Maiz and Ni Santas Collective. In the park’s Arthur J. Will Memorial Fountain, there is a large piece depicting the Lady of the Dead rowing a boat surrounded by flowers and fish skeletons jumping out of the water. 
On the Event Lawn between North Broadway and Spring Street, there is a community altar where people can write the names of deceased family members and pets as well as offer items to the dead. A hallmark practice of the festival is leaving offerings to the dead, often in the form of food to keep them nourished in the afterlife. The traditional offering is the calavera, a skull made of white or dyed sugar and decorated with other candy and colorful icing. Bread, apples and water were other popular choices for devotees to leave for their loved ones, but some people took creative license and left SunChips, mustard and packages of beef-flavored ramen. 
All elements are present in the offerings placed on the altar, fire from lit candles representing the loving souls of the deceased, water to quench the thirst of the deceased in the afterlife, earth from the food harvested from crops and placed on the altar, and lastly, wind represented by moving objects — often papier-mâché.
While Día de los Muertos is often conflated with Halloween, the two are completely separate holidays. This Mexican holiday directly translates to the “Day of the Dead” and is based in the Aztec belief that life is a temporary transition before death, where people become truly awakened. Many believe that on Oct. 31, the gates of heaven open and the deceased reunite with their loved ones for one day. Typically, Nov. 1 is devoted to the souls of deceased children, angelitos, and Nov. 2 is devoted to remembering the souls of adults. 
Orange paper marigolds are a centerpiece in many of the altars at the festival. Also known as cempasuchitls, marigolds are the flowers of the dead, and in Mexico they bloom bright orange and yellow during the months of October and November to help guide spirits back home. 
Some of the displays were covered with opaque plastic wrap, to protect them from the uncharacteristic Los Angeles rain earlier in the evening, but the large displays of painted skulls and flowers were unwrapped and illuminated by bright lights to show off their impressive detail and creativity.
Many Angelenos present at the celebration recognize this experience as very important to Mexican, and subsequently, Los Angeles culture. 
“It was cool to see Los Angeles participate in an important cultural event, especially one that is such a creative expression of paying respect to the dead,” event-goer Cody Woods said. 
The celebration of life and death began on Oct. 28 and will continue through Nov. 5 from 7 to 10 p.m. every evening.

Nayanika Kapoor | Daily Trojan
Movies and TV love to portray high school — and often in the same way: Bright-eyed, varsity letter-clad boys, hallways lined with spray-painted lockers and glass cases of sports trophies, Friday night football games with bleachers full of spirited students. My high school experience was nowhere close to this: Substitute varsity jackets with our sky blue pleated skirts and navy blue polos. Replace the hallways of lockers with an AstroTurf circle that everyone lounged on during sunny afternoons. Instead of watching football games, the school gathered to watch our robotics team navigate its creation through a maze.
For seven years, I went to Castilleja School, a tiny, all-girls institution in the heart of Silicon Valley. When people ask me what it was like to go to an all-girls school, I don’t have an answer. How do you quantify or describe something so central to your identity and development? Finding your voice as an adolescent girl is an entirely different experience at an all-girls school. When you grow up with 60 girls who have seen you through some of the most developmentally challenging years of your life, you find your identity and place in the community faster than the idealized tropes depicted on screen. For me, there was no fear of being lost in the crowd when everyone had been a part of my life since I was 11 years old.
In small, seminar-style classes, I learned the value of questioning entrenched beliefs. Understanding the danger of complacency and apathy. My school, specifically, was very community and social change oriented. Our teachers and mentors tried as much as possible to push us out of the bubble of the Silicon Valley — whether that be through inviting speakers like Condoleezza Rice or Nicholas Kristof speaking to the school, or taking each junior to a foreign country, paid for by the school. 
It was also secular, which was different from several other all-girls schools. This meant a comparatively progressive mindset, especially when it came to the topics of sexual education and women’s health. Discussion about resources, body positivity and sexual health were all at the forefront. While my school prided itself in being traditional and we had our fair share of parents who preferred that their children be shielded from these topics, conversation was often the first priority. Every year, an OB-GYN would talk to the senior class about contraception, tell us about resources in their new home states and initiate open conversations about party culture in college.

More than anything, my school was intent on fostering pride in being a strong woman. The values we celebrated were intelligence, curiosity and conviction. Because we grew up in an environment that granted us the latitude to challenge and argue, we had confidence in our beliefs and abilities when leaving Castilleja. We didn’t have to face the inherent differences in the way we were treated compared to our male counterparts. Some may call that naivete, but in reality, we were able to build our self-worth within the confines of a nurturing, yet challenging environment. Most Castilleja girls say that when attending college, they find themselves as some of the most opinionated and vocal students in the conversation. We weren’t taught how to “be a girl”— we were taught how to shatter the molds that had been made. Tradition and progress can be balanced — and they were. 
Castilleja was far from perfect. Attending an incredibly competitive school located in the Bay Area was not easy in the slightest. And there are things to be said about the kind of person that can succeed at Castilleja, where certain characteristics, personality traits and even career choices are favored. But when you have a student body that has been taught to question, rebuild and improve the world around them, you immediately build a community that is dedicated to bettering itself. A community that wants to maintain its essence, while still adapting to the times and learning from its students. 
As single-gender schools begin to adapt to different definitions of gender identity, I have thought a lot about what made Castilleja the place it was. Accepting people across genders will not fundamentally change the lessons and environment that made me who I am, and single-gender schools must explore what being “all-girls” means in the 21st century. Intellectual development, confidence and celebration of strength are not lost when we become more inclusive. I have faith that my school and other schools like it will be able to adapt and maintain their strengths as they continue to listen to their students and learn from the changing world.

Junior linebacker Cam Smith on Saturday celebrates after the Trojans sack the Arizona State quarterback. Photo by Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
When USC faced Arizona last year, the Wildcats were 2-4 and without their starting quarterback, Brandon Dawkins, due to injury. In his absence, they played a 17-year-old true freshman named Khalil Tate. He finished his first career start with 58 yards passing on a 39 percent completion percentage, and two turnovers as the Trojans won convincingly, 48-14. 
When No. 17 USC goes head to head with No. 22 Arizona in this season’s homecoming game at the Coliseum, the Wildcats will once again start Tate instead of Dawkins, but this time the Trojans will be anticipating a much more prolific outing from the Los Angeles native. Since taking over as the team’s starting quarterback against Colorado a month ago, Tate has taken the college football world by storm, rushing for 840 yards and completing 68.7 percent of his passes. But more importantly, he’s led the Wildcats to four straight wins and a shared spot atop the Pac-12 South with none other than USC. 
“We played Khalil last year, and just being a quarterback coach by trade, the progress that I have seen has been in his deep ball accuracy,” head coach Clay Helton said. “That’s what’s making him so hard right now to defend in this offense.”
In what Helton referred to earlier in the week as a “Pac-12 playoff game,” the Trojans will be forced to defend Tate with a battered defensive unit. Sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector is out with a broken hand, and junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin is sidelined once again with a toe injury that has plagued him since Week 2. While junior nose tackle Josh Fatu has cleared concussion protocol (he was involved in a car accident two weeks ago) and is likely to play more snaps than he did last week, junior cornerback Iman Marshall is still questionable with a knee sprain. 
Without Gustin and Rector to shore up the edge opposite junior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast will likely have to rely on sophomore Connor Murphy to help contain Arizona head coach Rich Rodriguez’s potent read option attack. In addition to Tate, running backs J.J. Taylor (518 yards) and Nick Wilson (353 yards) make up a ground attack responsible for the fifth most rushing yards per game in the country (338.6). 
The last time USC faced off against a team ranking in the top ten for rushing yards, Notre Dame rolled the Trojans for 377 yards behind quarterback Brandon Wimbush and running back Josh Adams. They bounced back nicely against Arizona State last week, holding the Sun Devils to 79 yards on the ground, but the team recognizes the heightened challenge it has on its hands as it encounters a hot Arizona team. 
“What we’ve stressed to our defense is just not taking the eye candy of chasing the quarterback,” Helton said. “Because what ends up happening to you, [like what you saw against Notre Dame] is a linebacker gets out of a gap … and then the back goes [for a big gain]. This is going to be a really disciplined football game by our defense. They’re going to have to play disciplined … They have tremendous, skilled kids in J.J., Nick and Khalil, who are running a very powerful offense.”
On the offensive side of the ball, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold is coming off of one of his most efficient performances of the year against Arizona State. He threw for 266 yards and three touchdowns, while avoiding any damaging turnovers for the first time all season. Darnold found redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns for several big gains, and the receiver finished with a career-high 126 yards and two touchdowns. 
USC’s big offensive day was not limited to the air, however, as junior running back Ronald Jones II rampaged for a season-high 216 yards. The Trojans are hoping to carry over a balanced, yet explosive offensive attack into this Saturday’s game. Arizona currently ranks second-to-last in Pac-12 total defense, giving up 447.9 total yards per game. 
Aiding the offense will be the return of freshman running back Stephen Carr, who has been injured since the Washington State loss in late September. He ran for 309 yards and three touchdowns, surfacing as a potential Pac-12 Freshman of the Year candidate, before going down with the foot injury. 
“I don’t know if he’s ready to go out there and get 40- 50 snaps, but he does look like he’s ready to contribute,” Helton said of Carr’s status on Thursday. 
As the regular season winds down, this weekend’s game against Arizona will go a long way in shaping the Pac-12 title picture. 
“It’s a group that wants to win a championship,” Helton said. “They know what’s at stake. I think they’ve prepared extremely well this week.”

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
Certain individual performances in sports stick with you forever. It hasn’t been too long since Sam Darnold, as a redshirt freshman quarterback, spearheaded a heroic comeback against Penn State last January, but I know the furious final minutes of that miracle will stick in my mind for decades to come. I’ll also always remember last Thanksgiving, when Adoree’ Jackson single-handedly cut Notre Dame to ribbons as a defender, runner, receiver and returner as the crowd braving rain at the Coliseum began to smell roses.
But great games can go against your team, too, and those memories remain just as vividly. I will never forget Stanford’s Christian McCaffrey during the 2015 Pac-12 Championship: Head coach Clay Helton had shed his interim label after guiding USC to the conference championship game just months after the Steve Sarkisian circus, and the Trojans were riding high off a statement victory over UCLA in a de facto Pac-12 South title bout.
Then McCaffrey lit USC up with 461 all-purpose yards, scoring three touchdowns on a rush, reception and — to twist the knife — a trick-play pass. The Cardinal dominated the Trojans 41-22 to take the conference crown and resign a deflated USC team to the Holiday Bowl.
It takes a perfect storm of sorts to set the stage for games like these: the right teams at the right time with the right stakes — and with one transcendent talent. Saturday’s game between USC and Arizona has those elements. The Pac-12 South is essentially on the line as the regular season winds to a close, and the Wildcats bring a four-game win streak into Los Angeles. Though USC bulldozed them 48-14 in Tucson last year, every other meeting between the two programs in the last decade has ended as a one-possession game. Many expect a closely fought battle, but it wouldn’t be the least bit surprising to see one special player step up and take over the game a la McCaffrey or Jackson.
Or Darnold? Unfortunately for Trojan fans, the man who looks most likely to dominate Saturday’s contest isn’t USC’s Rose Bowl hero and former Heisman contender — it’s his counterpart on the Wildcats’ sideline. Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate has owned the headlines in this week’s lead-up — and for good reason. The sophomore only seized the first-string job in early October, but he has already replaced Darnold in the Heisman race by averaging an absurd 210 rushing yards per game across his four starts, including a 327-yard effort at Colorado. Tate already has close to 1,000 yards — more than Trojan junior running back Ronald Jones II — and eight scores on the ground this season, in addition to his 784 yards and six touchdowns through the air. With Tate under center, Arizona has scored at least 45 points in every game, and it gashed Washington State for 58 points last week.
Unsurprisingly, the Trojans’ focus in practice all week has been containing the Wildcats’ unique threat. USC faced Tate briefly as a freshman, when he came in for garbage time in last season’s blowout, but he has since evolved into a track star, breaking off runs of at least 70 yards in four consecutive games. It will be a tall order to stop Tate, especially considering how Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush torched the Trojans on the ground for 106 yards and two touchdowns last month.
In truth, it feels like another embarrassing USC loss could be brewing on Saturday: Tate is the hottest player in college football right now, and the momentum and skillset he brings into the Coliseum feel eerily similar to the Fighting Irish’s rhythm two weeks ago. Not to mention the Inglewood native will be home, looking to impress in front of friends and family.
But occasionally, teams step up to be the immovable object to an unstoppable force. Leonard Fournette was the runaway Heisman favorite on a 7-0 LSU team in 2015 — until Alabama held the superstar to 1.6 yards per carry and sent the Tigers into a three-game tailspin. Perhaps USC can do the same this weekend, whether the defense chases Tate down or Darnold simply outguns his adversary. Despite the colossal disappointment of missing the College Football Playoff, the Trojans are still arguably the favorite to take home the conference championship, and five straight wins to end the season, culminating in a Pac-12 title in Santa Clara, would be as strong a silver lining as you could wish for.
In order earn that silver lining, however, USC will have to execute on Saturday. Arizona is arguably the biggest hurdle remaining in the program’s pursuit of its first Pac-12 crown since 2008 — which marked the last of seven consecutive championships. It’s tempting to dub the Wildcats this season’s Trojans while watching the team’s midseason surge under a new quarterback. But this weekend is Homecoming: It’s about repeating tradition, not passing the torch.

Freshman driver Marko Vavic pauses and looks for a space to make a pass to a teammate at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center Photo by Austin Paik | Daily Trojan.
The men’s water polo team has redemption in mind as it looks to take on No. 2 Cal on Saturday. 
This is the first time the two have met since the Bears took the championship title away from the Trojans at the end of last season. Not only does USC want to create a different ending from last year, but it also wants to beat Cal in its home pool, which hasn’t been done in recent years. To say the least, the team has been looking forward to this match for a long time.
“There definitely is a lot of pressure to help avenge ourselves in losing in the final, and avenging ourselves for not winning a championship last year,” sophomore driver Thomas Dunstan said. “But it also is kind of a new beginning for us to prove that we are the best.”
The Trojans sit one spot ahead in the rankings, but everyone knows it is going to be a fight until the end. With 13 seniors on the team, all of whom want to leave with that championship title, they have been practicing for this game for what feels like the whole season. The team may have changed slightly from previous seasons, but it is still as ready as ever for the challenge.
“I just think our team unity and togetherness is really good this year,” redshirt sophomore 2-meter Sam Slobodien said. “Everybody loves each other and we are ready to win a championship.”
One of the biggest differences for the team this year is the addition of freshman driver Marko Vavic. Recently clinching his third MPSF Newcomer of the Week Award, Vavic’s skill in the pool has not been overlooked. He now leads USC in scoring after netting six goals in the last two wins. His contribution is certainly something the team knows is an asset for heading to Cal.
“Having Vavic is a huge benefit for us,” Dunstan said. “It definitely takes some pressure off the rest of the players and puts it onto him, but he’s definitely one of the best players on the team that helps us score goals.”
While Vavic will help lead the charge offensively, the team must also be prepared defensively. Cal is led by senior Luca Cupido, the MPSF’s top scorer with 50 goals. Shutting him down will be a huge focus of the Trojan defense, but the players feel prepared.
“I would say their biggest strength is probably that they can just go off for 5 goals at a time, like, really quickly if they play on a motion a lot of the time,” Slobodien said. “That is probably their biggest strength that if they get hot they’re good. But, their biggest weakness is the same thing. If we can slow them down, they will crack under pressure.”
This will be put to the test this weekend, when the Trojans won’t have the backing of the homefield crowd there to support them. However, they are ready to finally take a win at their home and prove that last season’s ending was a fluke.
“I love it,” Slobodien said. “I love the challenge. I think we’re ready for them. I can’t wait to play them and get revenge for our loss last year.”
The Trojans want to win for their seniors, for the program and for themselves. But they also want to win for their coach, Jovan Vavic. In his 23rd year as head coach for the men’s team, he has seen many Trojan teams go by. Nine of those teams have won championships. This team’s goal is no different. The Trojans are ready to prove why USC will continue to have a long history of winning.
“I think I am most excited to finally show Jovan that we are the best team,” Dunstan said. “And have him have no doubts about it.”
