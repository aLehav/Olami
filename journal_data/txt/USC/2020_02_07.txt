Former investment firm CEO Douglas Hodge received the longest sentence in the admissions scandal to date in Boston federal court Friday.
His penalty included nine months in prison with two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and a $750,000 fine for paying to have four of his children falsely designated as athletic recruits on their applications to elite colleges, including two to USC and two to Georgetown University.
In a memorandum filed Monday, prosecutors recommended a two-year sentence for Hodge, calling him “among the most culpable parents charged.” They said his repeated involvement in the scam and the fact that he wrote off part of the admissions payments as tax deductions rendered his infractions more serious.
Nathaniel Gorton, the federal judge presiding over the sentencing, denied Hodge’s request to serve part of his sentence at his home, Law360 reported. During the hearing, Gorton told Hodge his actions showed “chutzpah” and said that his actions and those of the other parents in the scandal led to a devaluation of American education as a whole, according to court reporter Chris Villani.
“There was certainly a loss to the overall educational system in this country when Mr. Hodge and others repeatedly used their massive fortunes to illegally circumvent the college admissions process,” Gorton said.
The defense argued that Hodge deserved leniency for his lapse in judgment, citing charitable donations totaling $30 million and his establishment of a Cambodian orphanage as evidence of his philanthropic nature and stated that, unlike other parents for whom the government recommended penalties exceeding sentencing guidelines, Hodge did not involve his children in the scheme.
Hodge pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering for paying Operation Varsity Blues organizer William “Rick” Singer $850,000 over the course of seven years to arrange for four of his children’s college admissions. 
Hodge’s oldest child, who Singer marked as a tennis recruit on her Georgetown application in 2008, was the first incidence of Singer’s “side door” method documented in the college admissions case. Hodge attempted to fraudulently secure his fifth child’s admission to Loyola Marymount University in 2018, but Singer had already begun cooperating with federal investigators.
Prior to Friday’s sentencing, the longest sentence in the admissions case was that of USC alumnus Toby Macfarlane, who will serve six months in prison and pay a $150,000 fine for paying to get his two children admitted to the University as athletic recruits.

Though Randi Burley graduated from UCLA in 2011 with a fine arts degree, her first and lasting love has always been engineering. It crushed her while in school when her 20-hour work week prevented her from pursuing the rigorous major. However, she was happy with the possibilities fine arts opened for her to explore her role in society.
But after she graduated, she realized engineering was still important to her. 
That’s why, when the opportunity arose eight years later, Burley chose to pursue a second bachelor’s degree, finding herself in the electrical engineering program at USC beginning Spring 2019.
“It [had] always kind of been in the back of my mind,” Burley said. “I was not happy with not being able to do [engineering] in the first place. I have an incredible amount of pride, and I’m very stubborn. It’s not easy for me to lose, and it felt like I lost.”
Burley said she looked into her options and discovered that the Viterbi School of Engineering allowed students with bachelor’s degrees to enter the University as transfer students. She decided to enroll at Santa Barbara Community College so she could take prerequisite courses such as calculus and physics to meet Viterbi’s admission requirements. 
Holding a bachelor’s degree renders students ineligible for most University aid, so Burley works multiple jobs to pay tuition and relies on loans to cover the rest. Although quitting her full-time job as a small business owner to pursue electrical engineering was a financial risk, she was motivated by a desire to prove that she could combine two different areas she was interested in, she said.
“I had a lot of friends and some family members who were assuming that I’d drop out,” Burley said. “At the time, I’m thinking, ‘I’m going to do this and prove [them] wrong.’” 
Although Burley has faced obstacles in pursuing her engineering degree while at USC, including an age gap with most undergraduate students, she said she found a welcoming community at the University. Burley said she formed strong connections with people through the Viterbi Center for Engineering Diversity, who have helped her balance school and work, find scholarship and job opportunities on campus and supported her emotionally through her transfer journey. 
“From the first day I got there, the Center for Engineering Diversity has been sort of a home base for me,” Burley said. “I transferred in spring semester, so I was very lost and very new in [the engineering] field.”
Burley is active on campus as a member of several clubs, including Women in Engineering, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers.
For Burley, combining her passions for fine arts and engineering was important. At the NSBE Fall Regional Conference in San Francisco, she won first place in the competition which involved promoting an “elevator pitch.” The pitch was a collaborative interface that allowed partygoers to add their favorite songs in order of popularity based on thermal sensors, which would then measure the energy and temperature of the crowd, choosing the best music selection and thus eliminating the need for a DJ.
After more than a year at USC, Burley said her biggest challenge has been taking the first step toward pursuing a career path in an area different from her UCLA bachelor’s degree. 
“A mentor of mine once told me, ‘You have to get out of your own way,’” Burley said. “It’s easier said than done. I went through internal battles, deciding, ‘Can I even do this? I’m an artist, what do I look like even going into this field?’ And I think the biggest obstacle was myself.”
Rajuan Nelson, a senior majoring in environmental engineering, said he met Burley at an NSBE conference. It was there he learned about Burley’s journey into engineering.  
“I remember her telling [me about] her journey from art to engineering and it kind of made me realize the intersection [between the two],” Nelson said. “It’s the way that she articulates her work is so enthusiastic and makes you want to have the same passions as she does.”
CED Director Traci Thomas-Navarro said she knew Burley as a prospective student and had helped her navigate her career path. Thomas-Navarro said Burley was passionate about engineering and took courses for the sake of learning them.
“The courses that she takes really focus on the learning that happens in the classroom,” Thomas-Navarro said. “She’s doing well in the program, but I don’t think the drive comes from ‘OK, I want to get this grade.’ [It comes from] ‘I really want to take in this material and I really want to get to know the faculty member.’” 
Thomas-Navarro said Burley’s story is inspirational to other Viterbi students because most students worry about career prospects rather than genuinely caring about their craft. She said she believes Burley serves as an example of someone fellow students can look up to. 
“I think that she’s a great role model, and she doesn’t even realize how many people she has mentored,” Thomas-Navarro said. “It’s exciting that she comes from a different educational path.” 
Burley said she wants to use engineering to diversify her skill sets in the future and create work that “touches people’s lives in a way that is positive and meaningful.”
She said students should take the opportunity to explore multidisciplinary interests because it allows people to expand their knowledge. 
“This school, and the different departments in this school, are so excited to try something new, to try something innovative,” Burley said. “I think that as a student, you should never be afraid to go after something different or scary, because that’s where real accomplishments lie.”

Admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer forfeited $3.4 million along with funds of undisclosed value from his fraudulent organizations, the nonprofit Key Worldwide Foundation and for-profit The Key, in Boston federal court Thursday. The organizations acted as liaisons between the parents and the school and university administrators involved in the scheme, receiving payments from parents and paying out bribes. In several instances, parents wrote checks to the Key Worldwide Foundation and claimed the purported donations as tax deductions.
Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges of racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of justice for engineering the Operation Varsity Blues scheme, helping parents rig their children’s standardized test scores and bribe college officials to admit their students as false athletic recruits to universities such as USC. 
Singer facilitated more than 700 admissions to elite colleges for underqualified students, according to phone calls recorded and released by the FBI as part of the Varsity Blues investigation. USC launched a review of 33 students’ admissions following the release of the federal admissions scandal investigation in March and said in a statement that it has resolved most of the cases.
As part of the plea, Singer agreed to forfeit all property associated with the scheme, including bank accounts he used to cash checks parents sent him as payment for his “side door” strategy, in which he formed relationships with university officials and bribed them to lie about the applicants’ qualifications and recommend them for admission. At USC, senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, accepted $1.3 million in bribes for facilitating more than two dozen acceptances, and water polo coach Jovan Vavic received $250,000 in exchange for designating two unqualified applicants as water polo recruits.
In addition to the money, Singer surrendered control of checking accounts and assets associated with the college admissions scheme — including investments in private equities, a restaurant chain and a European soccer club — to the federal government. 
Singer founded the Edge College and Career Network, known as The Key, in December 2007 and conducted his first documented incidence of cheating two months later, when he bribed a Georgetown University tennis coach to designate the daughter of investment firm CEO Douglas Hodge as a tennis recruit, fabricating several national athletic awards on her recruitment profile. He continued to work with Hodge on his children’s admissions, arranging four of Hodge’s children’s college acceptances — including two to USC — until Singer agreed to cooperate with the government investigation in 2018.
A date has not yet been set for Singer’s sentencing. His next court appearance, a telephone conference, is scheduled for Feb. 20.

Eighteen candidates discussed diversity efforts, administrative transparency and subsidized transportation at Thursday’s Undergraduate Student Government Senatorial Forum, which took place at the Tutor Campus Center. USG Director of Accessibility Affairs Gwen Howard and Black Student Assembly member Jaya Hinton moderated the debate. 
Twelve of the candidates are running as six slates, or multi-party groups that focus on the same campaign platform and share election resources, as students prepared for the voting period to open next week. The debate alternated between general questions and targeted points for each candidate or slate. 
Candidates began by discussing their respective positions regarding how to make USG more accessible to students and addressing how they plan to expand the USG Listens initiative, an online form through which members of the USC community can submit comments about USG services and campus concerns.
Several candidates, including Julian Lin and Vadim Trubetskoy, emphasized the importance of conducting meetings with students outside of the USG office and reaching out more frequently to campus organizations.  
Senate aide and senatorial candidate Kevin Gutierrez said he plans to expand USG-sponsored town halls to a weekly event series that would allow students to interact one-on-one with USG representatives. 
“These town halls shouldn’t only be where an important issue arises but an ongoing area where students know they can come in and talk with their representatives,” Gutierrez said. 
Candidates also addressed the need for transparency between administrators and students. Similar to Wednesday’s presidential debate, several participants touched on the importance of student representation on the Board of Trustees to ensure student concerns are reflected in administrative policy.
“Everyone should be allowed to know what’s going on,” said Joshua Wigler, a senatorial candidate. “The student body needs to be involved in the system and I think … the Board of Trustees needs to release the millions of dollars of funding we utilize as a University and be transparent in what we’re spending and what we’re doing.” 
Shreya Chanda, a freshman majoring in biochemistry and global health, said they want students to be included in more administrative decisions, including hiring new professors and determining tenure. 
“A lot of the science department has student forums to decide whether professors should get to be on the tenure track or not,” Chanda said. “This is the kind of thing we need in the entire campus and in all levels of administration.”
Gabriel Savage, a junior studying philosophy, politics and law and narrative studies, said that events like the Environmental Student Assembly’s Divest SC Rally are important to draw the administration’s attention to student concerns on sustainability. Shortly after the Jan. 28 rally, USC disclosed that 5%, or $277 million, of USC’s endowment is invested in fossil fuels. President Carol Folt also met with ESA and Environmental Core the following week to begin facilitating discussions regarding actions the University can take to address its involvement in the industry.
“I think that making our voices heard as a student population is a really important step [to transparency],” Savage said. “Events like the [Divest SC rally] are important to force the hand of the administration and make it known that students care about what knowledge is out there.” 
Savage and his running mate Ruben Romeo also said they would develop a peer counseling service in response to the growing need for mental health resources. Uncle Joe’s Peer Counseling and Resource Center, which is currently in place at Washington University in St. Louis, would train pre-health students as counselors. 
“It’s a 24/7 call service where they can call and talk to students … that are their same age, that are not intimidating because they’re not professionals,” Romeo said. “But these are also facilitators that will get you connected to resources, and that’s something we need the most.”
Senatorial candidate Trinity Moore emphasized the need to address the barriers that arise with transportation to unpaid internships, as students are expected to spend their own money to fund the trips to and from companies. Through the Career Center, they plan on establishing a stipend for students with unpaid internships and creating a free Lyft program for students that would relieve the financial burden of transportation.
“I think we should definitely have a system that pays for USC’s transportation for their students to and from their internships,” Moore said. “It’s hard enough if you’re working for free, but if you’re also having to pay out of pocket for your Lyft services there and back, that’s just unfair.” 
The moderators also asked candidates to reflect on their personal blindspots regarding diversity. Candidates individually recognized their inherent privileges and emphasized the need to empathize with students from varying backgrounds. 
Jonathan Kamanta spoke on differentiating between minority experiences. 
“I think one of my main blindspots as a Black [man] is having this idea that there is a Black monolith … that just because we are minorities we go through the exact same experiences, but that’s not always the case,” Kamanta said. 
During the audience questions, a student asked candidates how they would support Greek life on campus. Multiple candidates touched on the potential addition of a student liaison.
“I think one of the most important things is adding a student liaison and a student representative between IFC, Panhellenic and USG as a whole so that we have someone that represents all of the ideas of all three branches,” sophomore senatorial candidate Nate Manor said.

For college students, it can be a regular occurence: the kind of work-numbing weekend that ends with headache-inducing stress and physical discomfort. Working long hours is sometimes unavoidable, but research has shown that overworking carries adverse effects on our mental and physical health. 
One solution is to get up, move around, exercise and break a sweat. USC students have two outstanding gyms at their convenience, class passes available for purchase, club sports and even recreational two-unit courses in  sports like basketball and soccer. But what if you’re not really a gym person, don’t want to spend the extra money on a class pass or haven’t had any luck with competitive club sports? 
Fortunately, there is one particular class that provides the perfect combination of exercise, social connection and fun. Taught by legendary professor, choreographer and dancer Jesus “Jay” Fuentes, “International Style Ballroom Dance” is a popular two-unit favorite open to students from all majors and skill levels. Housed in the Kaufman School of Dance, the class offers beginning and more advanced options for students a few times a week. 
Ballroom dance relies on trust, communication and simply letting go. At the end of a long day, there’s nothing better than going to class, learning a routine and letting the music take you blissfully away. Additionally, there’s plenty of time for personal growth; by the end of a semester, you can revel in the fact that you have learned half a dozen new styles of dance, such as Latin, swing, waltz and foxtrot. Unlike the focused intensity of the gym or the competition of other sports, “International Style Ballroom Dance” invites social interaction and provides a welcoming and easygoing atmosphere. 
Like any form of exercise, dance releases endorphins, boosting one’s mood. Going to a dance class may seem less demanding than visiting the gym, but dancing for 30 minutes can actually burn 300 calories.  While other forms of exercise such as running or swimming, rely on forward momentum dancing involves constantly changing momentum. Continually shifting directions, accelerating or decelerating is more inefficient for the body, but it means that you are working just as hard as other forms of exercise. Spending a few hours a week dancing is definitely a reasonable workout, one that guarantees improved flexibility, balance, strength and agility. 
Movement and dance have equally powerful effects on the brain. Not only does dance provide a great physical workout, it requires mental concentration, focus and effort in learning new skills and memory for choreography. Research has also shown that dancing with others can help reduce social anxiety, boost self-confidence and decrease stress levels. The more self-assured and relaxed you feel about yourself and your movement in class, the more this translates outside it. 
Besides its role as a stress reliever, dance is a wonderfully expressive outlet where students are encouraged to improvise and take creative risks that would be impossible to replicate in a gym. And unlike working out at the gym, ballroom dance recognizes cooperation; partner dances require individuals to work together to succeed, and dancing with many different people encourages collaboration, camaraderie and even empathy. 
The next time you are deciding on an alternative to a traditional gym workout, consider taking a dance class. Kaufman offers a wide range to choose from for all levels of experience, with diverse styles like jazz, tap, hip-hop, ballet and Bollywood. In addition to classes, there are several dance clubs, teams and events for students who just want to dance for fun. Break On 2’s monthly salsa night is a favorite for many students here at USC. So why not give dance a try? You might find your perfect stress-reliever.

Yesterday I was talking with a friend who told me about her recent trip to the Philippines, where her family is originally from. Although she had never been there before, it struck a chord deep within her to be face to face with and experience the land of her ancestors. She was taken aback and felt as if she had found a piece of herself there that she had never even known had been missing.  
I related the impressionable story she recounted to sentiments I had experienced during certain trips back home to Mexico. You get there, and somehow the real place shines with a luster impossible for the mind to visualize while you’re away. It surprises you dearly to find something you were not expecting to find; the resurging nature of a reality you had forgotten.
Of course, this sentiment I am referring to is nothing new or unique or foreign. Quite the opposite, it is widely expressed across nations and time periods, the ultimate familiarity of a homecoming. There’s nothing quite like coming back home to lay your roots once more from where you came, from where they belong. Yes, it is well-known and universally expressed that there is no place like home. And yet, this very notion attains even more meaning the further away we venture, away from the lands and sets of beliefs, values and ideals that befitted our homegrown culture into new and diverse and previously incomprehensible existences.
Suddenly we’re in a place where people act funnily and behave funnily, and it is easy to judge them until we realize they are doing the same to us. The longer we spend in such spaces, and the more we interact and are socialized into them, the less foreign they become and the more we learn to buy into them, comprehend them and become fluent in them. The more we succeed at absorbing and understanding them, the more we begin to understand the big picture, ceasing to be lost in translation. We allow our biological brains to do what evolution has hammered so far into its deepest recesses that it comes out as instinct: adapt. We learn to code-switch — or so we think, for we are not good at realizing just how much we’ve changed until we come back to the most familiar and find it, perhaps, just the tiniest bit foreign.
And so we learn the wisdom that J.R. Tolkien once revealed: that as we depart a place and grow without it throughout our journeys, we also find that the place has grown without us upon our return. 
This is the real cost of movement and change: the ground in between. The further we march into new and unventured territories, the further away we are from what was once known to us. And it’s a sad piece of wisdom to comprehend that what was so intimately well known to us will only remain so in our memories. Oh, if we could just freeze time so that upon our return a place, person or thing remained exactly as we left it — but in reality, it is not only us but also them that have left us behind.
And so we long to return, even when there is nothing to return to, except the new change we have learned to embrace. We must embrace change for it will take us to our next learning adventure, our next place from which we will look back at all those piling others from whence we came.
Unbeknownst to us, as my friend recently discovered in her first journey to a strange land that nonetheless would always in some timeless capacity be her home, a place never leaves us. Although it might die as we depart, living only in our memories and changed upon our return — it clings to us. And, like a phantom limb, it urges us to scratch it or massage it to relieve the pain or itchiness, even if it appears to be gone. And we return each time with new eyes, for we have grown, to see a new place, for it has changed.
Such is this ever transient experience that is life; we hold our breaths and plunge in after that which we must constantly find and find again.

Greta Gerwig (Best Director)
Catherine Orihuela,  a&e editor 
Nominated for Best Director at the 2018 Oscars for “Lady Bird,” many believed the indie darling would be recognized for her masterful 2019 adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women.” But alas, Gerwig was one of several female directors overlooked by the Academy, marking the second year in a row of an all-male directing category. In a post-#MeToo era, one would hope that institutions like the Academy would make a concerted effort to bring about greater gender parity in the film industry; but that doesn’t appear to be the case. Gerwig could have made Oscars history as the first woman to be nominated for Best Director twice. 
“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” (Best Foreign Language Film) 
Lauren Mattice, digital managing editor
Despite winning Best Screenplay and the Queer Palm prize at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Céline Sciamma’s feature was passed over for Ladj Ly’s “Les Misérables” as France’s nominee for the category. An 18th century romance between, Héloïse, a woman to be wed and the woman to painting her portrait for her suitor, Marianne, Sciamma describes the project as leveling the playing field, where “there is no muse, no fetishised, silent woman in the room.” Her efforts to make the project a statement of equality shine through in anecdotes by the cast and raises further questions as to why the highly-acclaimed film was set to the side.
Lupita Nyong’o (Best Actress for “Us”)
Natalie Oganesyan, associate managing editor 
The Academy is undoubtedly a relic, as evidenced by the lack of diversity of its nominations: no female Best Director nomination and, most prominently, Lupita Nyong’o’s snub for Best Actress. Nyong’o played not one, but two, difficult, captivating roles in “Us.” The only Black woman nominated in the Best Actress category, in true Oscars fashion, plays a slave — a sign of the Academy’s problematic fascination with trauma porn and misrepresentation of Black actors’ abilities. 
“Us” (Best Picture)
Stuart Carson, sports editor
It appears that the stigma that has dogged the horror genre since the Oscars’ inception is not lost on this awards season. “Us,” despite all of its merits, did not make the cut for Best Picture nominee this year. Considering it would’ve been only the seventh horror film nominated for the award, it is not difficult to guess why. It’s not a perfect film, but neither are “The Irishman,” “Ford v Ferrari” or “Joker.” Unlike those films, “Us” delves into one of the most strikingly underexplored subjects in film — class conflict — and delivers with an infinitely rewatchable and thought-provoking film. that improves with every watch.

You can’t talk about mainstream American popular culture without discussing the appropriation of Black popular culture into the hegemony. It is well-known that the former wouldn’t exist if not for the blueprint of the latter.
Cannabis and its use, like most cultural phenomena, became popularized in America by immigrants of color in enclaves, predominantly people from the Caribbean who settled in New Orleans and people fleeing from the Mexican Revolution. 
Weed’s history is inextricably linked to a complex, multi-faceted relationship with race, slavery, colonization and criminalization. While the plant is believed to have originated in Central Asia in 500 B.C., it was later spread to the Middle East and the Americas through trade and imperialism. Cannabis was used to placate slaves and was also the basis for hemp plantations in the American colonies. 
First imposed on Black communities in the Caribbean, namely Jamaica, cannabis was soon adopted recreationally, becoming a cultural and religious staple. Then, with the arrival of Jamaican immigrants in the early 20th century and the creation of distinct cultural districts like Storyville in New Orleans, jazz was born.
Cannabis helped the Jazz Age flourish, serving as a conduit for creativity, music production and performance. The 1920-30s saw the beginnings of cannabis slang and cultural development, specifically in Black communities. Joints were sold outside tea pads or cannabis bars. Musicians would light up on tea, reefer, grass — codes for cannabis, since the drug was vilified nationally and on the cusp of criminalization — singing tributes to the substance. 
Jazz musician Cab Calloway, who regularly frequented New York City’s famous Cotton Club, sang many odes to cannabis, including “Reefer Man,” which includes lines like “If he trades you dimes for nickels / And calls watermelons pickles / Then you know you’re talking to the reefer man.” Blues singer Trixie Smith recorded the iconic cannabis tribute “Jack, I’m Mellow,” which is featured as the intro song on the since-canceled Netflix show “Disjointed.”
Louis Armstrong, arguably the most famous jazz musician of all time, was a well-known viper, the name given to jazz musicians who smoked cannabis (after the hissing sound produced while inhaling smoke). Armstrong first tried cannabis — which he called “the gage” as was commonplace slang at the time — in the 1920s and used the substance throughout his career, before performances and recordings. 
While his cannabis use was debated and rumored for the majority of his career, Armstrong eventually opened up about his love affair with weed to biographer Max Jones near the end of his life, explaining that he had to give it up as the Prohibition Era dawned. 
Armstrong was an ardent supporter of cannabis’s medicinal and recreational benefits and was once jailed for nine days in Downtown Los Angeles City Jail after detectives caught him smoking at a parking garage (times haven’t changed much, huh?). There’s even a legend that then-Vice President Richard Nixon accidentally smuggled cannabis into the U.S. for Armstrong after saying he didn’t have to go through customs (look it up, it’s hilarious).
Known for its time-slowing effects, cannabis changed jazz musicians’ perception of their own performances, lowering their inhibitions and allowing them to experiment creatively — playing with beats, sounds and rhythm. Jazz, then, quickly became the hallmark of infectious, dance-inducing and joy-filling music.
Music psychologist Daniel Levitin wrote in his book “The World in Six Songs” that tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, disrupts short-term memory and enables musicians to be fully in the moment, allowing them to connect with their music and zero in on each note they play.
Breaking barriers during the Jim Crow Era, Armstrong heavily influenced popular culture for decades to come. While politicians demonized cannabis and jazz, which they called “Satanic” — and by association its musicians — Armstrong’s music dominated common American household radios.
Black activists have historically been at the forefront of cannabis culture and the pot revolution, as evidenced by Armstrong and other jazz vipers. Now, the mantle has been passed to influential cannabis industry figures like Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and Whoopi Goldberg, who work to empower their communities through weed entrepreneurship. 
Newcomers like Hope Wiseman, the youngest Black dispensary owner at 25, continue this trend, as do Dasheeda “The WeedHead” Dawson and Mary Pryor, two prominent Black female cannabis entrepreneurs and advocates. Pryor, who created the education firm Cannaclusive with two other women of color, hopes to address the lack of diversity within the burgeoning industry.
So as you enjoy cannabis today and for many days to come, recognize that cannabis has been wielded as a weapon against Black and brown communities — first as a tool for enslavement, later as a method of criminalization and now as a means of disenfranchisement, gentrification and cultural appropriation. 
Cannabis is inherently intertwined with Black history, and it is imperative to reopen up spaces within the industry, our mainstream culture and society for Black creatives and entrepreneurs to grow and reclaim what was denied and stolen from them.

The USC women’s basketball team will head to Northern California to take on the Cal Golden Bears and No. 6 Stanford Cardinal Friday and Sunday. The games will be the Trojans’ first meeting with each team this season and will provide an opportunity for the team to improve on its 3-7 Pac-12 record.
Last weekend’s road trip to Arizona resulted in a triple-overtime loss to No. 19 Arizona State and a 73-57 loss to No. 12 Arizona. While the two losses added to the blemishes on USC’s record, the battle with the Sun Devils proved that USC has the tenacity to stay competitive against elite competition. 
“I’m very proud of my kids and how they fought on the road,” USC head coach Mark Trakh said. “If the ball bounced a certain way, we would have won the game against Arizona State.” 
Despite the losses, freshman forward Alissa Pili garnered some positive attention for the team Monday when the Pac-12 recognized her as the conference’s Freshman of the Week. It was Pili’s second time receiving the honor. Her teammate, guard Endyia Rogers, also received the same award last week, making it the first year in program history the Trojans have had multiple Freshman of the Week honorees. 
Both Pili and Rogers have led USC’s offense all season. Pili nearly matched her season high in points by dropping 21 against Arizona. She leads the team with 14.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. 
“Them coming in as freshmen and having the impact that they are [having] is very rare, and to have two on the team is mind-blowing,” sophomore guard Desiree Caldwell said of Pili and Rogers. “I’m just excited to see how much better they’re going to get when they get older.”
USC will look to the two freshmen to continue their recent success against Cal Friday. The Golden Bears enter the game anxious to improve their conference record after securing their first Pac-12 win of the season Sunday.
Cal has already faced the conference’s toughest opponents in Stanford and No. 9 Oregon State and fared as poorly as one would expect. In light of these losses, USC will still have to keep Cal senior guard Jaelyn Brown and senior center CJ West in check. Brown leads Cal in scoring with 14.1 points per game while West has proven dominant on the glass, averaging 7.1 rebounds per game. 
Against Stanford, USC will face a team with a 20-2 record whose only losses are to Texas and No. 3 Oregon. Stanford’s roster is experienced, with six upperclassmen typically taking the court.
Expect Cardinal senior forward Nadia Fingall, who averages 5.4 rebounds, to be a big roadblock for the Trojans. Sophomore guard Lexie Hull also projects to give USC fits, as she carries an average of 13.5 points per game.
The Trojans will need to rebuild their momentum this weekend, as their schedule only gets tougher after the Bay Area road trip. After Stanford, USC will immediately face two more ranked opponents in Oregon State and Oregon.
If USC can play with the same tenacity seen against ASU and its earlier overtime thriller against No. 10 UCLA, the Trojans could be in for another competitive game, as they’ve proven their ability to take it to elite teams. What remains to be seen is if the Trojans can turn this competitiveness into their first road conference win of the season.
The Trojans will tip off against Cal Friday at 7 p.m. and against Stanford Sunday at noon.

A couple days ago, I had already written the Dodgers off. 
I thought their window had closed. I thought they’d choked away (and, to be fair, been cheated out of) the last of their championship opportunities. I thought they’d cemented their status as the second biggest joke of an organization in the Major Leagues. Honestly I thought they might have been Southern California’s second best team.
Then they traded for Mookie Betts and returned the Los Angeles baseball scene back to normalcy — for now. 
(Side note: I wrote this column before the rumors came out that the trade isn’t a done deal yet, but let’s assume all parties involved figure it out.)
In this city, each professional sport has an A-team and a B-team. There’s the Lakers, then there’s the Clippers. There’s the Kings, then there’s the Ducks. There’s the Rams, then — wait, who’s the other team again? 
Of course, the same is true with baseball. It’s the Dodgers, then the Angels. Recently, that disparity has consistently been reflected in the standings, but this offseason made things a lot more interesting. The Angels got Anthony Rendon. The Dodgers got older. The Angels got Julio Teheran and Dylan Bundy. The Dodgers sat on their ass. No longer a lock to win the division or even to be better than the “crosstown” rival — and having come off an insanely pathetic choke job against the Washington Nationals in the NLDS — the Dodgers were in trouble. 
Then, Mookie. Red Sox general manager Chaim Bloom decided to celebrate the barely-over-100-year anniversary of the Babe Ruth trade with a move eerily similar to the one that cursed Boston for the next 85 years, and Dodgers general manager Andrew Friedman realized his team wasn’t good enough to avoid another playoff disaster.
Ah! That’s it! L.A. is still Dodger town, and it always will be! Hallelujah!
Not so fast. 
The Dodgers, by trading for Betts, undoubtedly made their team better. But they also turned the 2020 season into a ticking time bomb. The pressure is on. And they can’t afford to screw it up again.
Let me know if you’ve seen this movie before: The Dodgers are arguably the best regular season team in baseball, fall short in the playoffs, make a big offseason move. “This year is our year! This puts us over the top!” Repeat. 
How much longer can they stick to this tired cycle and still claim the unofficial title of “L.A.’s team?” With that other team — the one that’s not really L.A. but calls itself L.A. — already having the best player of all time and now pairing him with one of the best hitters in the game in Rendon along with the improved pitching staff, my guess is not much longer.
Take a quick glance across the city and you’ll notice a similar situation that has dominated NBA headlines for the past year. The Lakers, L.A.’s historical powerhouse and supposed A-team, were fresh off an unspeakably disappointing season with LeBron at the helm, and the up-and-coming Clippers were poised to challenge and overthrow them as the city’s best. 
The Lakers, scared out of their minds of both missing the playoffs and being demoted to Runt of L.A., traded for Anthony Davis and the pressure was immediately turned up from 10/10 to 800/10. What happened? Both teams are championship contenders, but the Lakers are the No. 1 seed in the West. Not only is their throne atop the standings safe, but the city is still firmly theirs — at least until they inevitably meet up in May.
The Dodgers have completed those first two steps: disappoint, change. Now, they can’t afford to fail on the third, by far the most important: win. 
But that’s the part that eludes them every time it seems to be their year; every time it should be their year. They win 100+ games in the regular season, get to the World Series and lose or fail to make it in the first place because of some combination of Clayton Kershaw and Dave Roberts — not exactly the baseball equivalents of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick in terms of coming through in the clutch. 
That kind of collapse is what they absolutely cannot do this year. 
Don’t get me wrong, the Betts trade was a no-brainer for the Dodgers — especially because it only cost them Alex Verdugo and Kenta Maeda as of now and especially because David Price is a nice throw-in, even if he’s not the ace he was once supposed to be.
But it’s also undeniable that if before there wasn’t any pressure on the Dodgers to win — and win it all — this year, well, it’s title or bust for them now. 
And if it turns out to be the latter? 
That problem in L.A. will only become more glaring. And if Trout, Rendon and Co. have anything to say about it, this city might not belong to the Dodgers for much longer.

The USC men’s basketball team fell to No. 23 Arizona 85-80 in Tucson Thursday night. The loss dropped the Trojans’ road record to 4-3 and the team’s overall record to 17-6. It also continues a 13-year winless streak at McKale Center for USC.
In the first half, Arizona lived up to its title as one of college basketball’s elite scoring offenses. The Wildcats had the Trojans scrambling by shooting over 50% from the field and draining four 3-pointers in the first 10 minutes of the game. Even after an 8-0 run by USC, Arizona led at the half 33-23.
The deficit expanded in the second half with Arizona gaining a 15-point lead by forcing four turnovers in the first three minutes out of the break. 
By the end of the game, the Wildcats had converted 18 points off turnovers while only allowing six turnovers themselves.
“We had trouble stopping them,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “They physically and athletically hurt us in the first half on the boards, got some easy baskets and we had some really dumb turnovers. We had live ball turnovers that turned into transition baskets, so that hurt us and gave them the opportunity to get out in front.”
Even after multiple timeouts to stop the Wildcats’ momentum, the Trojans still could not produce an effective offensive strategy for much of the second half. This, coupled with a lack of offensive rebounds, gave USC a tough hole to dig itself out of, trailing by as much as 20 in the second half.
Still, with 10 minutes left, the Trojans found a way to keep themselves in the game. Senior forward Nick Rakocevic helped cut Arizona’s lead to single digits through the combination of a 14-point explosion in the second half and a defensive effort that prevented Arizona from scoring a field goal for the game’s final eight minutes.
With less than a minute to go, USC cut Arizona’s lead to 5 with key threes from senior guards Daniel Utomi and Jonah Mathews. Unfortunately for the Trojans, the effort was not enough to complete the comeback attempt.
Arizona freshman guard Josh Green was explosive offensively for Arizona, logging 18 points and shooting 50% from the field. USC freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu acted as USC’s crutch for the majority of the game and led the team in scoring, rebounds, and blocks.  
All eyes were on Okongwu’s matchup with one of  the NCAA’s other top centers, Arizona freshman Zeke Nnaji. Both came into the game averaging more than 16 points and eight rebounds per game and are first-round prospects in the upcoming NBA Draft. In the end, Okongwu edged out Nnaji on the stat sheet, scoring 23 points on 64% shooting to Nnaji’s 18 and 46%, though Nnaji’s 11 rebounds won him the rebounding battle.
As for USC’s other top freshmen, guard Ethan Anderson and forward Isaiah Mobley took a step back Thursday, logging only single-digit scoring performances that left Arizona’s defense unfazed.  
“Our league is very good this year top to bottom,” Enfield said in an interview with 790 KABC. “The home court means so much in this league so we battled tonight and we’re going to go battle Saturday and play a little more efficiently.” 
USC will head to Desert Financial Arena to face off against Arizona State Saturday in Tempe. Tip-off is at 7 p.m.
