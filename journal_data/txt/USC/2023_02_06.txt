The Los Angeles City Council officially approved a proposed 168-room Marriott hotel in South Central Friday, after hearing several rejections arguing that its construction would limit housing opportunities for the local community.
The seven-story hotel will be built on a 34,000-square-foot, city-owned site near USC and is expected to bring in $1.6 million of annual revenue to the city. The hotel will also provide up to 60 permanent jobs and 1,000 construction jobs, according to the city’s economic and workforce department. 
On Jan. 27, the City Council voted 10-1 in favor of the project, despite the local planning commission previously denying a permit due to concerns that the lot should be used for affordable housing. 
The property, situated at 3685 S. Vermont Ave., was formerly the site of Bethune Library. Real estate developer Orion Capital filed an application for the redevelopment of the site in Oct. 2021, but was denied clearance on the project last March after the city zoning administrator pointed out the limited options for affordable housing. 
Talks about the property go back as far as a Feb. 2017 Los Angeles Times Editorial Board piece that warned of the dangers of what is now called Measure S, which would impose short-term but significant limits on construction — including housing initiatives in L.A.
The council’s decision has been met with opposition by community members, religious leaders and social activist groups like Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, a tenants advocacy group which called the council’s decision “a failure around land use and decision making in the city.”
“We spent over 10 years advocating to ensure this public land is used for the public good,” the organization said on Twitter. “Simply put, this corporate hotel development does not meet the needs and desires of the community.”
However, Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who represents the area, said during the Jan. 23 City Council meeting that he believes the hotel project would bring economic benefits to the district. Harris-Dawson called the project one of “much controversy” but said the Eighth District “needs to be able to participate in the economy of Los Angeles.”
“When the World Cup comes to L.A., were we to go along with the folks opposed to this project, what the district would get out of that economic activity is increased traffic, people parking all through their neighborhoods, trash and everything else — and not get one dollar of benefit from that economic activity,” Harris-Dawson said.

Enough is enough.
We’ve all heard it by now: An alleged Chinese spy balloon was shot down Saturday on the President’s orders after the Pentagon said they had found it a few days earlier — just floating around Montana. You know, just chilling. And possibly checking out a nuclear missile silo nearby.
The news media, predominantly American, took to obsessing and pontificating over every detail. Left-leaning publications seized on the peculiarity of the whole ordeal, but insisted President Joe Biden was doing the right thing by not shooting it down immediately. An article for the Atlantic, in particular, showed a random moment of self-awareness: 
“Montana residents probably wouldn’t appreciate stuff spilling from the sky,” the article read. “Falling debris could maim or even kill Americans on the ground. Personal and property damage would occur. Kinetic action in a situation like this has a cost borne not by another country or its citizens, but by ours.”
Speaking of which, anyone remember Afghanistan? Syria? Iraq? No? OK, moving on.
Meanwhile, Republicans did what they always do: blame Biden. “President Trump would have never tolerated this,” “Why doesn’t someone just tell Joe Biden the Chinese spy balloon is unvaxed [sic],” et cetera, et cetera. Whatever. 
I can’t make myself care about all of this bullshit. And it’s not just because I’m writing this at three in the morning. Goading the public into being hyped for a war with China is just boring. 
There’s nothing quite like war, or even the prospect of it, to distract from domestic ills; it’s a tried-and-true tactic all over the world. (Isn’t it curious, for example, how dissent and allegations of corruption against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy all but disappeared after the Russian invasion last year?) And as you may have noticed, the United States could use a bit of a distraction right now. The brutal murder of Tyre Nichols dramatized by the very police department that killed him, fervent movements against teaching proper Black history — American history — and financial woes are few among many ills weighing down on this country. 
It’s also worth mentioning that we aren’t even sure if the balloon was actually conducting reconnaissance. The more cautious outlets called it a “suspected spy balloon,” but let’s be honest — just how much is that single word really doing? Fox News, of course, blared a breaking news alert simply headlined, “CHINA FLOATS SPY BALLOON OVER U.S.” China has so far claimed the balloon, but said it was a “civilian airship.” I won’t tell you who to trust. I can assume you, the American reader, would be predisposed to disbelieving China, and that’s perfectly reasonable. But also consider whether the Pentagon, an agency that went so far as to lie about the scope of a war (that it lost anyway) is a reliable source on the matter, especially when it’s the only source we have. 
And “who to trust” shouldn’t be the point, anyway. Picking sides in a petty war of rivaling economies only helps said economies and never the people running them. Besides, consider why the U.S. would benefit from making all this fuss in the first place. The last shred of American exceptionalism we have left is our sheer economic and military dominance over the rest of the world. 
The American dream is dead and our people are suffering, but at least our gross domestic product per capita is the highest in the world. But by 2035, a Statista analysis estimates, that last thread of relevance will, too, be dead as China overtakes the U.S. by a large margin. Perhaps, then, this great regime, solely reliant throughout history on iron-grip control of all that stood in its way, will fade away in Ozymandian fashion.
Until then, fall not for the dizzying propaganda of the U.S. media machine. Read through the lines, find the issues closer to you — the ones that truly matter. And then we’ll be fine — even if our country may not be.Jonathan Park is a sophomore writing about current events beyond the U.S. sphere.

People don’t know how to have an opinion. Correction: I don’t think people know how to have an opinion. Pretty presumptuous and bold of me to say considering I’m the opinion editor. However, I can say this because of my experiences on the job.
For the past three semesters, it has felt as though I have had to constantly remind others what an opinion is. For reference, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, an opinion is a “belief stronger than impression and less strong than positive knowledge,” something that “implies a conclusion thought out yet open to dispute.”
But when I hop on social media these days, nothing feels thought out and comments sharing different perspectives spark conflict rather than conversation. Things that should be up for dispute are not, and things that are backed with empirical evidence seem to face scrutiny. I’m sorry but the world is not flat. If Aristotle knew this back in 350 B.C., we should probably move on. 
As a columnist, I was prepared for discourse and conversation regarding my articles. I knew others wouldn’t always agree with my opinions, but that wasn’t a problem I had to resolve. It was an opportunity for me to share my thoughts and hear others’. But it becomes exponentially difficult to do so when all you hear are screams saying, “You’re wrong.” As an editor, I hear the public telling my writers that they are wrong, harassing them to a point where they are discouraged to write despite their will, vigor and thoughtfulness.
I do my best to learn from my mistakes, admit them and do my best to resolve them – a positive side effect of my anxiety. If someone disagrees with an assertion I’ve made, however, that doesn’t mean my point was a mistake.
Throughout all the pieces in the opinion section and of my own work, including this one, the author is neither right nor wrong because, for the most part, I write not to prove a point and win an argument, but to sort out the pandemonium that is my mind and to find solace in my work. While I can’t change how others think, I can listen and share my own thoughts.
I’m now at a point in my life where I’ve realized that it’s not my mind that is in pandemonium, it’s the entire world. We’ve altered definitions and meanings of words to degrade the idea of one being entitled to an opinion to mean one has the right to say and believe whatever they want and impose it onto others.
It feels as though we can no longer have meaningful conversations without them devolving into chaos. When I shared with my ex that I didn’t like tomatoes, instead of taking it for face value, he would force me to eat them in an attempt to desensitize me to the taste. Maybe that’s why we aren’t dating anymore. I think I hate tomatoes more now.
We have become so polarized in our way of thinking that any difference in thought is seen as a personal attack. We aren’t making any progress politically or socially by screaming at each other and calling each other delusional. I can’t seem to scroll through TikTok without finding out there’s a new sociopolitical issue tearing down yet another influencer for not being “woke” enough. But at the end of the day, hate and cancel culture change absolutely nothing.
Back in 2020, at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, a crowd of protesters confronted a woman seated outside a restaurant on 18th Street NW in Adams Morgan for not raising her fist in solidarity with the movement. When she refused, the protestors surrounded her and it was almost like a scene out of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” accomplishing nothing more than showing an example of white privilege.
Bullying someone into submission and reacting in fear and anger only pushes others away further, making them afraid to share their own opinions. I mean, would you listen to someone if they were screaming and attacking you?
With the world fitting on the screen in our hands, we think we see everything there is. But it’s important to remember that our screens are catered to our own beliefs, reinforcing our own biases and only showing us what we want to see unless we actively seek out other perspectives. So, no, you’re not “right,” people are simply agreeing with you, which means others are allowed to disagree with you.
In his Farewell Address on Jan. 10, 2017, discussing democracy and the ties that bring us together, Obama said, “We weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren’t even willing to enter into public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are seen not just as misguided but as malevolent.” 
It’s easier to say that someone is wrong than to put yourself in a position that allows your beliefs to be challenged. It’s safe to stay within the confines of our curated “for you” page and feed, but, in allowing our thoughts to go unchallenged, we find ourselves selectively choosing facts that become self-destructive.
Obama went on to say that “Politics is a battle of ideas. That’s how our democracy was designed … But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter … we’ll make common ground and compromise impossible.”
What is the worst thing that can happen if you just listen to what another person has to say? What is the worst thing that will happen if you just let yourself learn something new and step into someone else’s shoes? Not everything has to be a fight, it can just be a conversation if we allow it to be.

Black History Month is not only a month for the remembrance of the generations of Black individuals and communities who fought for liberties throughout history, but also a month celebrating Black culture as a whole. This year, Black History Month follows the theme of “Black Resistance,” and the exercising of forms of resistance against persistent oppression. 
One important form of such resistance is through the creation of spaces for Black artists to share their artwork and their culture, on their own terms. On Feb. 2, two USC Roski students, Jayna Dias and Angel Itua, held the opening to their art exhibit “The Black Experience” in the Roski Fine Arts Gallery, which featured their artwork as a visual representation of their found experiences, struggles and the intersectionality between their identity and culture.
To display their artwork, Dias and Itua chose to configure their work into sections that encapsulate their experiences: “The Features,” “The Hair” and “The Struggle.” Within these sections, Dias and Itua beautifully crafted works featuring a multitude of art mediums, such as photography and paintings, as a way of bringing multiple perspectives and interpretations of Black representation to light.
“We chose the most integral or most important parts of what makes up a culture. For example, our hair is so important in Black culture,” said Itua, a junior majoring in art. “The features that we have [are] so important to Blackness. The struggle that we have is what created Blackness in the first place. The history of it and the excellence, there is excellence wherever you see Blackness. So we just wanted to highlight that.”
Sydney White, a freshman majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, visited the art exhibit Thursday in interest of exploring their art and in supporting Black artists. White expressed a particular connection to the exhibition as a Black student and said the impact of Dias’ and Itua’s exhibition goes far beyond the surface.
“For me, this exhibition, it means a lot because it’s made by us, so it’s not only someone trying to interpret our experience, but they’ve actually experienced it,” White said. “It means more that it’s coming from someone who’s actually gone through these things. They’re not just taking us and making it some sort of exhibition. This is truly their experience and I think it’s really cool.”
Dias said the exhibition as a symbol of representation. The importance of such representation is found within all levels of this exhibit, cycling from viewer interaction to even participants involved in the artwork themselves.
Kyla Carter, a model in one of the untitled photographs within the exhibit, was unaware of what the exhibit was beforehand, but said the experience was “organic,” with Itua telling Carter“to just go for it.” 
“We knew it was ‘The Black Experience,’ but we didn’t know all the artists that were gonna be a part of it. We didn’t know what photos they were gonna choose, how it would be presented,” Carter said. “It’s stunning. It’s great to see people of color shining and represented in this way.”
“The Black Experience” serves as a powerful demonstration of art as a crucial instrument of agency and showcases the talent and vision of Dias and Itua.
“We were looking around USC and there wasn’t really a lot of space for Black artists,” Itua said. “So we wanted to create something for the Black experience and the culture that we have. We wanted to celebrate it because it needs to be celebrated and USC really needs a space like that. So we decided to take the step for ourselves and create something for us, for all the students.”
The exhibition is available for viewing from Feb. 3 to 15 at the Roski Fine Arts Gallery.

Kaufman School of Dance Dean Julia Ritter has always been moving. Nursery school teachers told her mom she was rhythmic and loved partnering movement with music, a talent and drive that led her to pursue an undergraduate degree in dance and a nearly three decades-long career in higher education.
A dance artist, researcher, scholar, pedagogue and former chair and artistic director of the dance department of Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University — a position she held from 2010 to 2021 —, Ritter succeeded founding Dean Robert Cutietta. Cutietta, who also served as the dean of the Thornton School of Music and created the Kaufman School in 2014, stepped down from both deanships in May 2022.
“The former leaders set up an incredible school,” Ritter said. “I mean, to build a school in such a short amount of time, that’s had an incredible reputation, takes a lot of insight, takes a lot of hard work.”
Ritter, who came to Los Angeles after many years of living and working in New York City, said she was excited by the opportunity to live in “one of the most vibrant economic [and] creative capitals of the world.” Taking over the reins of leading Kaufman interested her, too, because of the school’s position as a new, young community dedicated to dance.
“Having the opportunity to be at the center of dance in L.A. is really one of the key things that brought me to Kaufman,” Ritter said. “There’s so much to learn about the community across L.A., but then also the dance community at USC, which I’ve learned over the past few months is vibrant in and of itself.”
Holding degrees from Texas Woman’s University, Temple University and Rutgers University, Ritter said she values the introduction higher education gave her to improvisation and choreography, which have been a source of “pure joy” throughout her life. 
“I truly believe improvisation and choreography are collaborative processes, and I’m a big proponent of being in collaborative and devised spaces,” Ritter said. “Creating the conditions where there can be lots of input from many different people are some of the most exciting realms of being for me.”
Ritter’s vision for Kaufman — which, she said, is informed by the interests of the school’s constituency of students, staff, faculty, the Board of Councilors and partners in the greater L.A. community — includes thinking more broadly about performance.
“We have proscenium performances in theaters, both here on campus and out in the community of L.A.,” Ritter said. “But we also want to think about site-specific performances and performances that might happen in places across the campus that might be surprising.”
Audiences can have a manifestation in almost any discipline … A lot of it is thinking about how we serve others and serve our communities. I like to often talk about that in terms of wondering, “Who are we serving, how are we serving and how better can we serve them?”
Ritter is also looking to expand the scope of identities dancers can hold: Kaufman, she said, was founded to create exceptional dance performers who could walk into any sort of performance environment and be literate, so the curriculum is built around training dancers to many kinds of literacies. 
“Another part of building and maturing the Kaufman school would be thinking about multi-hyphenate artists, and that dancers can take on many, many different kinds of pathways toward building their own careers,” Ritter said.
Many students, Ritter said, want to build technical strength, but are also intellectually curious and eager to “really craft a life for themselves that speaks to their values and speaks to their interests.” The school is thinking through a curriculum that would allow dance students to take on other majors and explore interdisciplinary interests, she said, by opening up schedules to make time for speakers and collaboration time. 
Ritter described USC as a “school of schools,” a structure that varies greatly from Rutgers, she said. The fact that USC houses six art schools — the School of Architecture, the Roski School of Art and Design, the School of Dramatic Arts, the School of Cinematic Arts, Thornton and Kaufman — is “just incredible,” she said, and invites potential for inter-school collaboration to help students move across discipline lines. 
“The two institutions [USC and Rutgers] are very different in terms of structure, and I find that really exciting to come together with the other arts deans, and also the deans from other disciplines, to talk about our shared missions,” Ritter said.
Haven Lin-Kirk, dean of the Roski School of Art and Design, wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan that she believes Ritter brings “deep knowledge and a profound understanding of the art of movement and dance.”
“I’ve already found [Ritter] warm and open to collaboration with Roski and the other art schools,” Lin-Kirk wrote. “I look forward to working further with Kaufman through future programs.” 
Ritter said her service at Rutgers instilled in her an interest in audiences as a concept with different meanings. Audiences, she said, are traditionally seen as relegated to performance, but they exist in other contexts, too. 
“Audiences can have a manifestation in almost any discipline … A lot of it is thinking about how we serve others and serve our communities,” Ritter said. “I like to often talk about that in terms of wondering, ‘Who are we serving, how are we serving and how better can we serve them?’”
The dance scene, both in performance and education, was heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Ritter said, and performers and academics are now trying to imagine what dance should become.
“All of us are still recovering from the trauma of the pandemic and figuring out what does dance mean now and what can dance be now,” Ritter said. “Many dance organizations really struggled through the pandemic.”
New Kaufman graduates, Ritter said, are entering an industry still recovering, so the school is working to ensure students can thrive in hybrid and online environments as well as live environments. Teaching and learning dance over Zoom was difficult, she said, but Kaufman took the challenge as insight into the role of technology in dance and the importance of understanding dance media.
Ritter never stopped creating choreography, despite her foray into administrative roles, which she said she took on because she became interested in what it means to be a leader in dance. 
“[I became] really interested in … how we can take a field that can sometimes be challenged … A lot of resources are needed for dance, you need a lot of people to dance, you need big spaces to do dance, you need costumes, you need lighting — how do we advocate for those kinds of resources?” Ritter said. “That became a really interesting challenge to me.”
A recipient of three Fulbright Scholar awards, Ritter has traveled across the world — from Germany to Taiwan to Turkey — to share her scholarship and glean new perspectives on dance.
“I pursued those opportunities … because it would allow me to be in new spaces,” Ritter said. “In some ways, that’s a bit of a theme for me — to come out to L.A. as a new space, too. I’m always really interested in, ‘What does it mean to dislocate ourselves from our comfortable surroundings?’”
Patrick Leder-Morrow, assistant dean and chief development officer of Kaufman, said Cutietta’s departure from the role elicited some worries among faculty members about the school’s future, as he was “such an integral part” of Kaufman’s success. Ritter’s arrival quelled any concerns, Leder-Morrow said.
“She’s … really done a lot to really pull the school together at a time when it could start to fray because Rob was no longer with us,” Leder-Morrow said. “The moment she stepped foot in the building, she tightened that up and made us all feel like, ‘Oh, this is gonna be good; She’s gonna be good.’”
Leder-Morrow manages fundraising for the school and said Cutietta was involved hands-on in managing relationships with donors and supporters, but his time was split between Kaufman and Thornton.
“[Cutietta] was in the trenches,” Leder-Morrow said. “The problem was, he was in two trenches.”
Leder-Morrow and his colleagues couldn’t really picture what it would be like to have a full-time, Kaufman-only dean, but now that Ritter has served in the role for more than seven months, he said they “didn’t know what [they] were missing.” From the time she assumed the position, Leder-Morrow said Ritter has allowed him to guide her through forming relationships with the school’s key constituents, including its 20 major donors. 
“I really respected her for that and I greatly appreciated the competence that she was showing in me and, I think, her interest in doing what was best not for her, but for the school,” Leder-Morrow said.
Cutietta’s step down came at a “turning point” for Kaufman, Leder-Morrow said, as the school has been riding high on its newness for nearly a decade. The time has come, he said, to reflect on sustaining the success the school has had and maintaining an upward trajectory of innovation and growth.
“I feel like this leadership transition, although it’s challenging, it couldn’t have come at a better time because, naturally, the school has gotten to a place where it’s time to make a shift,” Leder-Morrow said. “Having Julia come in with this fresh perspective and with her background and expertise and experiences is really going to be great for the school in terms of ‘What is Kaufman 2.0?’”

Warning: This review contains spoilers.
Picture breaking into and entering a home — it’s likely that the hypothetical intruder would only need to break one window to get in. So why spend effort on breaking all the windows, the door and every part of the house you can possibly find?
That arduous (and needless) process feels much like M. Night Shyamalan’s latest film “Knock at the Cabin,” adapted from the 2018 novel “The Cabin at the End of the World” by Paul Tremblay, which features a group of four intruders that break into a family’s cabin. These four intruders are Leonard (Dave Bautista), Adriane (Abby Quinn), Sabrina (Nikki Amuka-Bird) and Redmond (Rupert Grint). Yet, each of them are quick to convey that they aren’t just intruders; They’re instead the chosen ones, tasked with delivering a critical message by virtue of the visions they’ve received from an otherworldly force.
Once they’ve broken inside the cabin, the four demand that either Andrew (Ben Aldridge), Eric (Jonathan Groff) or their daughter, Wen (Kristen Cui), sacrifice themselves to stop the apocalypse. Every time the family doesn’t make a decision, one member of the intruder group will be killed by the other members.
It’s a clever premise that ends up becoming rather formulaic, as each member of the group dies in succession throughout the film through a series of bloody battles and escape attempts. “Knock at the Cabin” should instead be called “Multiple Deaths at the Cabin” as the story is basically that. Moreover, Eric decides to sacrifice himself at the end, giving off the impression that the four deaths before were all in vain. If only Eric would have decided that earlier, then all of the backstories would have felt more integral.
Even as the film structures itself around these repetitive deaths, the story seems fixated on humanizing all of the characters involved. Humanization is always a compelling idea, but here it feels strained and shoveled in, much like the mantra that the group members repeat every time one of them dies. 
Everyone involved carries out an impressive performance, with the real standout being Bautista. Bautista looms as the leading presence, while still receiving enough screen time to show that he’s only doing this to the family because he cares. 
Despite that, the film seems to think that there can’t be a villain in this story. As a result of that, it tries to include every character’s context, verbalized through each member of the group. 
While the goal was likely to make each character’s death more impactful, the additions feel exhausting when the characters die shortly afterwards before the audience gets fully invested. Shyamalan inserts various flashbacks of Andrew and Eric throughout their imprisonment in the cabin. These flashbacks usually depict Eric and Andrew being happy parents to do … what? Make audiences sympathize with them? Show the stakes involved? These flashbacks, while touching, don’t exactly move the story forward other than explain the backstory of the relationship, which drags the urgency of the present life-and-death situation. 
There’s something in there about Redmond being the man who attacked Andrew in a bar out of homophobia, but the implications of that aren’t clear when it comes to moving the plot forward. In effect, that point ends up confusing audiences. 
The issue here is with the stakes. The group members aren’t allowed to kill members of the family, so as heartless and cruel it is to think about it, the family could merely sit back, be patient and let each stranger die on their own before going free. An escape doesn’t feel necessary, so it’s questionable why the family wastes so much time and energy trying for one.
Perhaps the filmmakers checked off “high stakes” in the process of making this film. After all, nothing could be more at stake than the fate of humanity, a consequence that shatters all the windows, conveniently forgetting that someone only needs to break open one door to enter.
“Knock at the Cabin” literally knocks down multiple entrances of the cabin for each member of the group when it could have focused on just one core element. The film needlessly presents each character’s backstory, includes the unnecessary hint of homophobia and doesn’t answer the question of why the sacrifice and violence is necessary. All these arcs proceed in a suffocating fashion, just like the cabin suffocates the family. Upon further thought, it’s no wonder they wanted to leave.

The Black Student Assembly at USC hosted the SC Black Flea Market for the whole USC community on Feb 3. The market took place from noon to 3 p.m. at Founders Park, with dozens of tables and booths circling around the central lawn. Music played and sunlight shone as students had a good time chatting and buying specialty items from various vendors. 
According to the event organizers and BSA special events chairs, Miles Mogush, a senior majoring in business administration and music industry, and Elande Abate, a junior majoring in communication, there were around eighteen vendors present, selling handmade jewelry, crochet hats, artistic paintings, creative posters and other fashion items. 
“As for our special event ideas for Black History Month, we wanted to have themed weeks. So each week celebrates a different aspect of what makes Blackness amazing,” Mogush said. “This week is Black excellence. We wanted to promote all of our excellent Black-owned student businesses. And I feel like it’s a good starter event to introduce everyone to our vendors.”
Among them was Lensa Hamda, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, who is an ambassador for BSA, and one of the vendors at her jewelry and charms booth. 
“During one of the e-board meetings, I shared about how I made a lot of phone charms, and I got really into jewelry-making over winter break,” Hamda said. “One of the other e-board members who is planning the whole Black History Month event asked me if I wanted to be a vendor. And I was kind of scared … But she said it was for any student to showcase all their talents and to spotlight all of the many talents that students have outside of education.”
Events like these highlight the ingenuity and creativity of students, rather than solely focusing on academic achievement. SC Black Flea offered an opportunity to foster community both among members of BSA and USC at large, and also highlighted the creative diversity of USC students. 
SC Black Flea was an opportunity for students new to owning a business to get experience selling their items and services. The atmosphere was laid-back and everyone seemed genuinely excited to be there, connecting with others and seeing all the cool things available for purchase.
“I’m trying to juggle between doing my classwork and then I’m making a bracelet and making the phone charms while I’m not in class and then trying to go to work as well,” Hamda said. “I’ve never had that experience of running a business. So this is all very new to me, but I’m still very optimistic.”
This event followed the first ever Black Career Fair, where BSA offered free headshots, resume reviews and mentorship from industry professionals. As co-special events chairs, Mogush and Abate are holding events every Monday, Wednesday and Friday during February. 
“I’m excited to see all this Black excellence and be able to have this space for students to show all their talents, especially during Black History Month,” Hamda said.

Apart from their on-the-court threads, such as the 21 generations of Lebron shoes, soccer jerseys, football helmets and tennis skirts, what do athletes rock off the field?
The world of sports has been running parallel to the world of fashion for decades. What used to be just ubiquitous stadium entrances are, literally, turning into concrete runways. Athletes nowadays are no longer perceived only as athletic figures, but also sensational forces in encouraging the vocalization of perspectives. One prominent way of doing that is through fashion.
Out of all the athletes that left a significant influence on bridging sports and fashion, Kyle Kuzma comes to mind amid his recent accomplishments and conversations involving the Washington Wizard small forward. However, before jumping into Kuzma’s personal brand and contribution to the NBA tunnel walk-of-fame, it’s necessary to first recognize his passion for fashion.
Having had enough of Ralph Lauren polos and khaki cargo pants, Kuzma started his fashion transformation at the University of Utah in 2014. Being drafted and moving to Los Angeles gave him the funds he needed to materialize his visions. Besides finding his role on the basketball court, Kuzma was equally determined to pinpoint his identity off the court, which he commented on in a 2022 interview with The Washington Post. 
“The fashion scene in LA just spoke to me. I was like, ‘Yeah, this is what I like. I enjoy putting on clothes. I enjoy looking at fabrics, touching different fabrics, knowing the difference between them,’” Kuzma said.
While posting best career stats in Washington, the former 27th overall pick of the 2017 NBA draft also launched his own personal fashion brand, “Childhood Dreams,” with PUMA in 2020. Much like its name, the brand takes inspiration from Kuzma’s youth basketball aspirations and emphasizes sustainability by using recycled and plastic-free fabrics in its clothing line.
The underlining of sustainability is further established through the apparel’s designs. The three arched arrows of recycling encircle the PUMA Cat logo with the inscription “A/W 2022 rooted in excellence sustained in hope” sitting just above, making this logo unique from all other PUMA products. The brand’s hoodie has tattoo-like lettering of “Dreams” screening over silhouettes of children who, according to Kuzma’s brand, are the future of a sustainable world. Twelve different products are currently retailing on PUMA’s website, ranging in price from $40 to $250.
By now, Kuzma’s contribution to the NBA’s walk-of-fame has gained quite a reputation. From his #Leatherman Rick Owens full-black jacket to his flurry Mr. Saturday full-body fit, Kuzma left some of the most memorable outfits on the league’s pregame “red carpet.”
But the pink sweater was just different.
In November 2021, soon after Kuzma arrived at Capital One Arena in front of flashing cameras and rolling tapes, social media did what it does. Twitter user @nba_paint photoshopped Kuzma’s oversized Raf Simons sweater to be even more oversized for every 25 likes received. Not long after, the piece was staring into D.C.’s skyline like a kaiju from Japanese sci-fi. Some media users even compared Kuzma to the inflatable tube people dancing outside gas stations.
The oversized Raf Simons reverse sweater was made from mohair, one of the most esteemed fibers. The silky texture extracted from the coats of Angora goats is involved in manufacturing carpets, upholstery and high-end garments. The piece itself is designed as a drop-shoulder crewneck with sleeves long enough to cover Kuzma’s mid-calves. Raf Simons’ label patch is located right above the chest instead of in the typical interior neck seam to give a little extra spunk.
Since entering the industry in 1995, Raf Simons has embraced the vision of being youth-centric in polishing the mixture between art, pop culture and fashion. Simons’ pieces are loved and worn by many other athletes, including NFL linebacker Isiah Simmons, NBA point guard Tyler Herro and retired NBA forward Dennis Rodman. In my opinion, though, Kuzma is the one that really kindled the piece’s iconicity.
“I’m never wearing that again. It’s not really a thing you’re going to wear out,” Kuzma said in a September 2022 interview with Complex. “It’s an art piece.”
The good news is that the pink sweater is here to stay! Just about a month ago, the Washington Wizards gave away 10,000 Kyle Kuzma pink sweater bobbleheads at a game against the New York Knicks. Working with the merchandise agency BDA, Kuzma injected his personality into the creative process. Not only do the bobbleheads have swingable arms to mimic the exaggerated sleeves, but the figures also carry Kuzma’s lower left cheek mole and textures of the sweater and beanie.
If you want one of the 10,000 Kyle Kuzma bobbleheads, your best bet will be to scour eBay.
All that being said, Kuzma is not one to back down from styles he appreciates because of controversy. Former NBA teammate LeBron James refused to like his Instagram post calling the outfit “outrageous,” while NBA guards Isaiah Thomas and J.R. Smith also articulated their opinions by commenting, “that one ain’t it” and “Man hellll nawwwwwww.” The Raf Simons sweater, Rick Owens trousers, and Amiri sneakers were a collaborative blueprint designed by Kuzma and his stylist Toreno Winn Jr. 
Despite waves of mixed opinions about his fashion sense, Winn said in an interview with The Washington Post that “it was satirical, but we opened up the minds of people. There doesn’t have to be this cookie-cutter way of dressing. The first rule of fashion is there are no rules,” — to which Kuzma replied, “Good job, this is what we do.”
Undoubtedly, Kuzma greatly influences younger generations and is representative of self-confidence in both sports and fashion. Personally, I grew to recognize Kuzma’s fashion images more and more as he continues to be unafraid of approaching style risks when not wearing #33.

The No. 10 USC men’s volleyball team had a tough trip to Pennsylvania, losing both of the matches they played in the Pac-12/Big Ten Challenge. The Trojans lost 3-1 to No. 4 Penn State Friday and 3-1 to No. 13 Ohio State Saturday. The Trojans fall to 6-4 on the season and are now 1-4 against ranked opponents. 
In the match against Penn State, the Trojans lost a hard-fought first set 30-28 after coming within one point of winning multiple times. They couldn’t recover in the second set, losing to go down 2-0. The Trojans did win the third set, but it proved to be too little, too late as the Nittany Lions won the fourth and final set and the Trojans lost 3-1. 
In their match against Ohio State, the Trojans built a big lead in the first set before losing it late to go down 1-0. They won the second set to even up the match at 1-1, but Ohio State made adjustments and the Buckeyes won the third and fourth sets giving them a 3-1 victory. 
Despite not getting the results they wanted, the Trojans did a lot of things that signal that this season could have a bright future. Head Coach Jeff Nygaard was especially enthused about how his team played defense all weekend. 
“From the standpoint of block and defense, I thought we were actually doing our job with that phase of the game at a level that gave us opportunities to have success,” Nygaard said. 
The weekend also tested the Trojans’ depth, as Nygaard made several adjustments to the usual rotation throughout the weekend. Fortunately, the Trojans’ depth turned out to be a strength. On Friday, redshirt sophomore outside hitter Jack Deuchar came in off the bench and took advantage of his opportunity for extended playing time by setting a career-high with 9 kills. 
On Saturday, it was Jackson Reed who came off of the pine to be a hero. The redshirt sophomore outside hitter, who is normally a serving specialist for the Trojans, proved he is equally as skilled in the front row with new career highs of 5 kills and 4 blocks. However, Reed’s most crucial skill turned out to be his passing, which Nygaard was impressed with throughout the game. 
“Jackson is a really good passer, so we went with him and he steadied out quite a bit of the passing line,” Nygaard said. 
In addition, freshman setter Ryan Sprague came off the bench on Friday and played well enough that he earned a spot in the starting lineup on Saturday. In his first start, Sprague racked up 37 assists, a high mark in his young career. Sprague emphasized that his time on the court has directly led to an increase in his confidence. 
“Now I kind of feel like, OK, this is NCAA men’s volleyball, this is how I need to win a game,” Sprague said. “Figuring that out, it’s just giving me more and more confidence.” 
Perhaps the biggest revelation of the weekend, though, was the play of an established superstar. Following an All-American season in 2022, redshirt junior opposite hitter Simon Gallas hadn’t quite matched his superstar level of play in 2023. But on Saturday, Gallas reminded everyone who he was in a big way, putting up the best all-around performance of his college career. Gallas led the team with 14 kills, but he also had 11 digs (which also led the team) for the first double-double in his career. 
Similarly to Sprague, Gallas credited his performance to his increasing confidence. 
“I trusted myself more to just take a rip at it,” Gallas said. 
If Gallas can sustain success, the Trojans will be extremely dangerous from the front row. So, despite an 0-2 weekend, there were many bright spots for the Trojans. With a week off ahead before conference play begins, the key will be building on those moments of success and turning them into entire matches of success. 
“You’re seeing some things in real time where guys are growing into their roles and their jobs, which is a positive,” Nygaard said. “But, we didn’t get the result that we came out here for so … we’ve got a week off from competition so we actually get to work on all of the things we know we have to improve at.” 
Fortunately, the Trojans feel confident that they will be able to get back to their winnig ways.
“We have a long way to go with this team and I think the potential is off the charts,” Sprague said. 
The road to glory always starts with success in conference, and the road to conference glory begins Wednesday, Feb. 15 when the Trojans will open MPSF play against Grand Canyon.
