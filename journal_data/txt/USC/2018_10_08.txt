Fifty years from now, when movie fans and critics look back on which films best captured some of today’s most prominent social issues, “The Hate U Give” will undoubtedly top the list. Adapted from the young adult novel of the same name, the film is a poignant examination of race relations and police brutality through the eyes of 16-year-old Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg), who witnesses her unarmed best friend’s murder at the hands of a police officer. 
The film starts with a young Starr (Kai Ture), along with her half brother Seven (Lamar Johnson) and younger brother Sekani (TJ Wright), receiving “the talk” from her father. “The talk” is not about sex but about how to survive as a black person in America and what to do when pulled over by the police: hands on the dashboard, no sudden movements.
While at party in in the neighborhood, a teenaged Starr runs into her old childhood friend, Kahlil (Algee Smith) who, after gunshots break up the party, offers her a safe ride home. From here, everything goes downhill. On the way home, the two are pulled over by police and when Kahlil questions why he’s being pulled over, the situation quickly escalates.
The police officer tells Kahlil to step out of the car. Starr relays her father’s advice to him — put your hands on the dashboard, do what the officers say, try to stay alive. Kahlil steps out of the car and, while the officer runs his license, Kahlil decides to reach back into the car to pull out a hairbrush.The officer mistakes this motion for Kahlil drawing a weapon, panics and shoots him three times in the chest — all while Starr watches from the passenger seat with horror. The shooting traumatizes Starr, and she becomes conflicted on whether or not to testify against the officer as the only key witness to her friend’s murder.
As activist April Ofrah (Issa Rae) states, a grand jury almost always indicts the person who is being tried, unless that person is a cop. In this sense, the audience knows that the officer who killed Khalil will never see a trial. In fact, the film never outright reveals the grand jury’s decision; the verdict is only implied near the end, when Starr looks down at her phone with an expression of utter disbelief. Similar foreshadowing is employed when the media portrays Khalil as a drug dealer and the audience knows this fact will be used to justify his murder. 
Instead of spelled-out plot points, this film offers something deeper. It’s a period piece, one that accurately reflects the pain and heartache of African American communities when it comes to police brutality and systemic cycles of oppression — including prison and drugs, which trap multiple characters. The film’s depiction of Black Lives Matter protestors clashing with police emulates the Ferguson riots, where the media, protesters and police were all caught in an unforgettable historical moment. The film couldn’t possibly capture the drama and plight of those weeks, but it doesn’t need to. Rather, it ends on a hopeful note, and poses possibilities for change: How can the toxic cycle be broken? How can people learn to love each other? How can people empathize with how black Americans live, and understand that their lives matter?
The only mishap of this film was its casting, which garnered controversy surrounding colorism from the book’s illustrator, Debra Cartwright. Starr, in the book, was described as a dark-skinned black girl, but filmmakers decided to cast Stenberg, a lighter-skinned, biracial actress, for the role. Stenberg was captivating as Starr, and her ability to evoke emotion in painful situations was not only believable, but sometimes terrifyingly real. However, the discrepancy in her appearance lingered throughout the film, because her interactions and experiences would have been different if her skin was darker. Yet, this relatively minor detail does not overshadow the important cultural commentary the film offers.
The title “The Hate U Give” is an acronym for “THUG,” which references “T.H.U.G Life,” a tattoo on activist and rapper Tupac Shakur’s stomach. The idea is that the hate shown to young children can harm them and those around them for life. This notion is evident in the film when Starr’s younger brother Sekani aimed a gun at a gang member who was threatening Starr and her family. As the police arrive, they turn their guns on Sekani. This moment captured the cycle of abuse that was referenced throughout the film, and, by stepping in front of her brother’s gun, Starr boldy demanded that it’s time for the cycle to be broken. Hopefully one day, it will be.

Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro tallied a total of 73 sets in the Trojans’ matches against Oregon and Oregon State. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
After sweeping Oregon State (25-20, 25-18, 25-21) on Thursday, the women’s volleyball team found itself on the other end on Sunday, suffering its first home loss at the hands of No. 20 Oregon (26-24, 25-22, 25-20) at Galen Center. 
The Trojans fall to 4-2 in conference play. 
Head coach Brent Crouch said after Sunday’s game that the players’ execution needed improvement.
“There weren’t a lot of bright points between [Sunday] and Thursday’s games,” Crouch said. “Our hitting numbers were spectacular against [Oregon State]. [Sunday] was a different story. We did not execute well — we doubled their hitting errors, doubled their serving errors. That’s the game, that’s the match.” 
Before this weekend, Crouch was looking to improve their serving, but it was not smooth sailing in either game. The Trojans were still able to shut out the Beavers on Thursday night, but they struggled with serving consistently throughout the three sets as they finished with 10 service errors and five aces. Oregon State also struggled with serving, finishing with seven service errors and one ace. 
Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro was a bright spot on Thursday, finishing with 35 assists and clinching her eighth double-double of the season with 10 digs. In conference play, Lázaro is averaging 11.11 assists per set and has helped anchor USC’s offense throughout the season. 
“In terms of setting, she’s been incredibly consistent,” Crouch said. “It’s really pulled us out of some tight spots in the past.” 
On Sunday, Lázaro provided the same consistency, but even with her skill and the intense hollering from fans, the team was unsuccessful in rattling Oregon’s offense. Despite keeping the score close throughout the match, the Trojans had recurring difficulties with their service game, also recording 10 service errors. They had trouble blocking the Ducks’ outside hitters, who seemed to punish USC’s weak passing at every opportunity. These mishaps forced two early USC timeouts in the first quarter. With two illegal back row hits also hindering the Trojans, the Ducks used their momentum to end the matchup in three sets. 
Crouch was uncharacteristically brief after Sunday’s match, offering a terse comment. 
“Not sure why we didn’t execute today, but we didn’t,” he said. 
Despite enduring their first loss at Galen Center this season, the Women of Troy were still able stay relatively sharp individually. Senior libero Reni Meyer-Whalley led the Trojans in digs during both the first and second frames, garnering a total of 11 for the match. Senior libero Victoria Garrick was also a major defensive asset, leading all players with 19 kills in the match-deciding set. 
With two more home games next weekend after a road-heavy schedule so far, the team will rest before returning to Galen Center Friday against Arizona State.
“Hopefully, this [loss] lights a fire under us,” Crouch said. “I thought we could have beaten Oregon in three if we just didn’t have all those errors. This will definitely help create the focus we want in practice this week … It’s only going to get tougher as the Pac-12 goes on.”

Senior defender Ally Prisock netted the first goal of her career against Arizona on Thursday. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
The Trojans bounced back from a loss to No. 1 Stanford last week with wins over Arizona on Thursday and Arizona State on Sunday at McAlister Field.
Against Arizona State, the Women of Troy had a great offensive start in the first half in a 3-1 win, making aggressive plays and creating dangerous opportunities. The Sun Devils’ defense shut down many Trojan attempts in the first part of the half, with the Trojans only able to put five of their 17 shots on frame.
The USC offense stayed strong throughout the latter part of the half by controlling the possession and pace. The offensive prowess paid off with a goal from redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo off a corner kick in the 36th minute. The Trojans took a 1-0 lead into halftime.
Freshman attacker Penelope Hocking brought some excitement to the second half with a goal in the 62nd minute off a cross from junior defender Julia Bingham, making the score 2-0. 
The Sun Devils responded, as senior forward Casey Martinez took advantage of an opening in the Trojan defense and fired a shot late in the half to bring the score to 2-1. Arizona State fought for another goal to tie the game; however, redshirt sophomore forward Samantha Bruder scored her first goal as a Trojan in the 83rd minute, securing a 3-1 victory.
“In the first half, we started with a great tempo, moving the ball, putting them under pressure, creating opportunities. I thought we did a really, really good job in the first half,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “[In the] second half, we got a little sloppy in our defending, but all in all we continued to move the ball well, still created some chances, and ultimately got the 2 goals that we needed to finish it.”
On Thursday, the team secured its 10th win of the season after beating Arizona 2-0. The win marked the Trojans’ ninth shutout win of the season.
The Wildcats only had two shots on goal, highlighting the Trojans’ intense defensive pressure, and redshirt sophomore goalie Kaylie Collins was solid throughout.
USC’s offense took no breaks this game, charting 10 shots on goal compared to the Wildcats’ two. The offense pushed hard and controlled possession for the majority of the game, tiring out the Wildcats and forcing them to defend for longer periods of time. Senior defender Ally Prisock nailed a penalty kick in the 32nd minute to secure the Trojans’ first goal of the game and her first career goal. 
 The Trojans added a goal in the 49th minute. Redshirt junior forward/defender Natalie Jacobs received a pass into the box from sophomore midfielder Arlie Jones and hammered the shot into the net to bring the score to 2-0.
“It’s always good to bounce back in a game like this, especially in the fashion that we did,” McAlpine said after the Arizona game. “I thought we did a really great job in our possession and forcing them to have to defend for longer periods of time, which we struggled with a bit last week.” 
With all parts of the Trojan offense, defense and midfield working together, USC was able to anticipate and shut down the Wildcats’ attempts for the remainder of the game. The Wildcats snuck in one shot on goal in the second half, which was saved by Collins, keeping the final score of the game at 2-0.   
The two wins marked the Trojans’ 10th and 11th victories of the season and their fifth consecutive double-digit win season with McAlpine at the helm.
The Trojans look to keep the momentum against Washington State in Pullman, Wash. Saturday at 7 p.m.

Even in Hollywood, Cinderella sports stories don’t necessarily end in bliss. My favorite sports movie, “Moneyball,”chronicles how the 2002 Oakland A’s, a small-market team with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, managed to compete with the likes of New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox not by outspending them, but by using advanced analytics — unheard of at the time — to put together a winning roster with cheap players.
My favorite line is when General Manager Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, is flustered by his scouting department’s unwillingness to be innovative and yells: “There are rich teams and there are poor teams. Then, there’s 50 feet of crap. And then there’s us.”
That year, the A’s, with an approximately $41 million payroll, a roster full of nobodies and a dilapidated and outdated stadium, won 103 games, tying the Yankees — who spent $125 million — for the most in baseball. They set a then-American League record by winning 20 consecutive games. They revolutionized baseball, changing the way teams evaluate players. They were the subject of the book, “Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game” by acclaimed author Michael Lewis, which was made into an Academy Award-nominated film starring Pitt. 
But there’s one thing about the 2002 A’s: They didn’t make it past the first round of the playoffs. The “Moneyball” A’s, despite a blistering 103-59 regular season record, fell in five games in the division series. “Moneyball” worked, up until it really mattered.
I wrote this column five days removed from the 2018 A’s suffering a similar fate. Beane is still the GM and they still play in the same dilapidated stadium. Yet, the A’s were the first team in 30 years to enter the season with baseball’s lowest payroll ($66 million) to make the playoffs. They were a roster of misfits, castoffs and journeymen that somehow won 97 games — 22 more than they did last season, the fourth most in baseball and more than any National League team.
In plain English, the 2018 A’s did an amazing thing.
This summer, I had a front row seat to the magic. I covered the A’s for my internship from May to August, and I’ll be honest: I didn’t expect to witness high-intensity games during my time in Oakland. The A’s were picked by many to finish last or second-to-last in their division. They were young and unproven, a few more years away from contending. In my first couple of weeks, they didn’t do much to prove otherwise.
Then, June rolled around, and they couldn’t stop losing. I went from ignoring the playoff standings to chronicling the A’s surge up the ladder. They won 13 of 18 series and had an MLB-best 63-29 record after June 15. On that date, they trailed the Seattle Mariners by 10 games for the final playoff spot. They not only made up that gap, but they also clinched the spot by a clear seven games. That is remarkable.
As a journalist, I don’t root for a team to win, but rather for the best story. With every win, the A’s were becoming a headline sports story. And man, they became fun to cover. 
What made it better was that the players didn’t care for the attention. The clubhouse was always loose, blasting music pregame and after wins. They joked around, played basketball on a mini-hoop and seemed like a group that genuinely enjoyed being with each other — an occurence in sports that is rarer than one might think. 
I bet the casual baseball fan could not name three players on the roster. Despite them having Khris Davis, who led all of MLB with 48 home runs. Or closer Blake Treinen, whose 0.78 ERA was the lowest in baseball history for any pitcher with at least 80 innings thrown. Or third baseman Matt Chapman, who posted the seventh highest WAR (Wins Above Replacement) in the league. 
Those aren’t household names. None of them make what the best players on the Los Angeles Dodgers or Chicago Cubs do, yet the A’s finished with a better record than both teams. 
But here comes the “however”: the 2018 A’s also didn’t make it past the first round of the playoffs, if you can even call it that. They were overmatched by the Yankees, 7-2, in the American League Wild Card Game on Wednesday. (The Yankees’ Opening Day payroll? $167 million.) The A’s, who put together another storybook regular season, were eliminated on day one by a big-market team with a much higher payroll and much bigger names.
Watching the game last week, I could not help but root for the best story: the A’s Cinderella season continuing. I watched this team work too hard to get to this point, shatter too many expectations and shut up too many critics to make a one-day cameo in the postseason — especially at the hands of the Yankees, the antithesis of the A’s in every which way.
Yet, that was the way it ended. Billy Beane, 16 years after changing baseball, is still looking for the ultimate reward for his efforts: a championship. If the small-market A’s ever get it done in Brad Pitt’s lifetime, it would make for a damn good “Moneyball” sequel.

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
Since its humble beginnings in the 1970s, hip-hop has been identified by many as a man’s genre — and particularly for a “man’s man,” if you will. For much of its history, these conventional definitions of masculinity have been reflected in the genre’s most popular and influential artists.
First, I must admit: I love a great deal of this music. Artists like Big Daddy Kane, N.W.A., 50 Cent and countless others have contributed to some of the genre’s most essential, and unapologetically masculine, records over the years. Find me someone who can’t get down to 50 Cent’s “In Da Club,” and I’ll show you someone who’s allergic to infectious production and a timeless chorus. Even so, the sheer amount of misogyny, violence and excessiveness in their music is painfully obvious to the average listener, and these flaws have been consistently derided by the public.
Recently, this notion of masculinity in hip-hop has been turned on its head because of artists like Young Thug, Brockhampton and Tyler, The Creator among many others. The quintessential image of the street-hardened, sexually promiscuous man weilding a duffle bag and pistol is no longer an accurate depiction of the genre. In fact, hip-hop has transformed into a genre that transcends race, gender, sexual orientation and economic class — something that represents far more of humanity than its past iterations.
For many, Tyler, The Creator represented a kind of toxic, callow masculinity. Lyrics containing mindless violence, homophobic slurs and off-putting vulgarity fueled Tyler and the Odd Future collective’s initial breakout in the late 2000s. Their demographic more or less reflected this content, with sold-out shows comprised mostly angry, misfit teenage boys following their viral success. 
Yet, in the decade since Odd Future first made waves in online chatrooms and music forums, Tyler has grown up before our eyes. His most recent project, “Flower Boy,” wasn’t so much a departure from the rebelliousness and angst-ridden masculinity that created him, as it was a moment of growth and self-acceptance. The media frenzy over Tyler’s alleged homophobia swiftly transformed into a media blitz on his sexuality. All the while, Tyler has laughed his way to the bank and the Billboard charts.
Unsurprisingly, Young Thug has been one of the hip-hop’s skirt-sporting torchbearers, eschewing traditional definitions of masculinity for women’s clothing and painted fingernails. Young Thug has built an incredibly successful career in a male-dominated field like trap music by defying both gender roles and conventional sounds. The rapper is comfortable with his outlier status in a brand of hip-hop defined by homogeneity and expectations, and continues to defy them in his career.
In addition, Young Thug’s genderbending philosophy extends far beyond aesthetic value. In an advertisement for Calvin Klein in 2016, he proudly proclaimed that he doesn’t believe in gender, saying that one can be a “gangsta with a dress” just as easily as one can be a “gangsta with baggy pants.” 
Most recently, the all-American boy band Brockhampton has paved the way for a new generation of hip-hop fans by penning verses about current social issues such as mental health, queer issues and rape culture. The group of young men from San Marcos, Texas, has built an enormous cult following through its particular focus on vulnerability and unity, a stark departure from the ego-driven masculinity of last decade’s hip-hop topics.
While Kanye West makes bigger headlines for his M.A.G.A. hats and erratic behavior, he deserves plenty of credit for contributing to this sea change in the mainstream. At the height of hip-hop’s bling era in the early 2000s, West famously burst onto the scene rocking a pink polo and a backpack with “The College Dropout.” The album’s unapologetic nod to “backpack rap,” conscious hip-hop and suburban audiences was almost unprecedented in the genre’s history, sharing stories about university life and apologies to his mother.
In fact, in September 2007, West engaged in a friendly sales-off with 50 Cent for the respective releases of “Graduation” and “Curtis.” Many in the media saw this as a showdown between 50’s bling-era masculinity and West’s personal, introspective lyrics in the court of public opinion. When the dust settled, “Graduation” heavily outsold “Curtis,” and critics accepted the former as the new cultural zeitgeist.
Yet, this change is not to say that toxic masculinity in hip-hop is dead — far from it. That attitude continues to sell records and fill seats to this day, but things are changing. Hip-hop culture has effectively become the mainstream culture and, in turn, new artists, sounds and attitudes spanning every sect of the population arise every day. Toxic masculinity may be the hurdle for hip-hop, but it will be far from the last.

Eighty years have passed since Janet Gaynor starred in the first iteration of “A Star is Born” (1937). Since then, the film — arguably Hollywood’s favorite story — has been remade three times, in 1954, 1976 and now 2018. With Bradley Cooper’s latest version, an ambitious choice for his directorial debut, the actor-director fashioned this age-old tale to fit snugly in the modern-day music scene. Under his keen eye, the film successfully immerses viewers into a romance supported by two mighty leading performances from Cooper and Lady Gaga.
The plot, immortalized in the Hollywood consciousness, is almost as old as film itself. Despite undergoing four variations, the skeleton of the story remains the same: A male celebrity falls in love with a young woman with great talent. After performing together, her career takes off while he struggles with personal demons that threaten to undermine his own fame. Previous versions of the film revolved around characters in the film industry; the narrative only came to center on the music industry after Barbra Streisand starred in the 1976 version, paving the way for Gaga. 
Gaga dazzles in her role as the up-and-coming singer Ally, but because of more than just her vocal prowess. Like the fictional Ally, the film is Gaga’s maiden voyage onto the silver screen. Gaga’s comfort in front of the camera makes it easy to forget that it is her first time starring in a major motion picture. Her prior experience commanding the stage shines through — in every performance scene, she dominates as her voice blasts through the speakers and her visceral expressions demand the audience’s undivided attention as they contort with the shifting emotions of each song. 
Cooper’s country star, Jackson Maine, is a persistent alcoholic with heavy emotional baggage; his dialogue is minimal, but his morose aura is present every time he is on-screen. Even so, Cooper is wise (and humble) enough to dial back so Gaga can shine brightest when she needs to. This is epitomized in their first goosebump-inducing performance of “Shallow,” in which Cooper physically moves to the fuzzy background as he gladly yields center stage to his leading lady. 
Gaga and Cooper have a tangible chemistry, a testament to all the preparation that went into building their relationship. While they both have domineering stage presences, the two were able to balance each other out perfectly, each taking turns giving the other the spotlight.
Aside from his performance, Cooper’s directorial touch shines through in this remarkable debut; there is an intimate feel to the entire film underlined by Cooper’s wise decision to employ mostly close-up shots. The purposeful cinematography keeps the audience close to the players even after the plot widens. Dozens of concerts, and eventually the Grammys, play important roles in the plot, but their grandeur never detracts from the close relationships the audience has built with Ally and Jack. 
Cooper’s direction stumbles during the second third of the film as he fails to condense a period where there is little to no action. He uses musical montages to fill the empty space but rarely sees them through to their full potential. In one instance, a bass drum beat ushers in a song perfect for a road-trip montage as Ally and Jack are set to go on tour; however, the sequence is cut short before the song can peak and the film returns prematurely to a concert setting. Nevertheless, letting such minor flaws undermine the entire experience is truly making a mountain out of a molehill. 
Commanding performances and intelligent filmmaking — topped off by a powerful original soundtrack — yield an engrossing audio-visual experience, but primarily, “A Star is Born” is a captivating emotional journey. 
Both characters are presented to viewers up close (literally) and personal, flaws and all. Through all of Ally and Jack’s ups and downs, the audience is led to feel everything with the couple: love, hate, excitement, anger, fear and despair — sometimes all at once. As Gaga belts the moving finale solo “I’ll Never Love Again,” at one point breaking the fourth wall by gazing directly at the camera, the film’s crux surfaces. Faced with tragedy, Gaga’s character Ally continues on — now confident in her voice and image, but most importantly, still grasping onto a sliver of hope.

Following a year-long public silence, Twenty One Pilots released its fifth album “Trench” on Oct. 5. (Photo courtesy of Fueled by Ramen LLC)

Experimental pop, rap, emo and the-whole-kitchen-sink duo Twenty One Pilots has returned from a year-long musical hiatus to deliver its fifth studio album. After selling out tours and accepting a Grammy in their  underwear, Ohio natives Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have released a record that reflects on their rise to stardom and the tumultuous social
 culture of 2018. The resulting effort is “Trench,” the duo’s most surreal work to date, taking the reader on a journey through 14 tracks dealing with love and the collateral damages of fame. 
Mutemath frontman Paul Meany is a frequent collaborator, and his influence shows up in spades. The production on “Trench” is more spacious, ripped straight from some retro otherworld. The alien nature of the sliding keys and twinkling synths create an uneasy feeling. “Trench” also leans into the cinematic with beat shifts to give audio cues for changes in emotion across a track, as seen on “Chlorine,” which features a mood-changing outro. Listeners directly engage with Joseph’s isolation, making these moments the most potent on the album.  
Pitch-shifted vocals return with a vengeance, shaping melodies in the background throughout the record. These voices exist under the main vocal track, lurking as a electronic foil to Joseph. Their inhuman tones feed into the sci-fi production, surrounding Joseph until he is the only human voice in a sea of manufactured sound.
The other big change from the band’s previous work is its usage of bass lines. This musical undertone has been used in the band’s other hits “Ride” and “Lane Boy,” but is much more versatile on “Trench.” Creatinga slick groove on “My Blood” or crunching against the drums on “Jumpsuit,” the bass sets the tone for the genre each track flirts with. 
Joseph and Dun’s genre-bending musicality still dominate as they interpolate reggae, rap, rock and pop throughout the album. This time around, the songs feel more connected than in previous installments; each track on the duo’s previous LP “Blurryface” is self-contained with its own sound and identity. 
“Trench” is a cohesive album in which each track is layered on like an ascending spiral staircase. Each offering works on its own, but it builds upon the previous track to elevate the listener onto the next song. The beats flutter and warble in the background to sew each track together into a larger symphonic tapestry. 
Historically, fans connected with the band for its vulnerable lyrics and mental health messages. However, the band has faced backlash for allegedly romanticizing suicidal thoughts and depression. The duo directly combats this notion on the visceral “Neon Gravestones,” which deals with the treatment of early celebrity death — Joseph contemplates whether he should end it all but instead calls out the culture that stigmatizes and ignores struggling entertainers only to shower them with posthumous laurels after they die too young.  
“I’m not disrespecting what was left behind / Just pleading that it does not get glorified,” Joseph recites.
Piano and drum instrumentals frame the track, building until a choir erupts. With the final verse, the production cuts out almost completely, leaving Joseph to plead with his audience. The fragility in his voice that carries across the track makes it the most vulnerable song and the greatest standout on the album.
Other songs on the album prove to be equally entertaining and potent. “Smithereens” is speculated to be about Joseph’s wife, hitting with the mushy charm of a low-budget romantic comedy that works in spite of itself. “Chlorine” starts off simple but breaks into a desperate cry for connection in a barren world. “Bandito” is militant, hammering its catchy hook into listeners’ brains while accompanied by up tempo drums. 
Ultimately, these widely disparate songs are woven together thematically by Joseph’s insecurities. Joseph doesn’t “Leave The City” on the final song — a space symbolizing depression — but finds the support to help him with his journey. “Trench” proves to be a rewarding listen for longtime fans and casual listeners alike. Twenty One Pilots continues to showcase why it is one of the most idiosyncratic mainstream musical groups out there by pushing boundaries with every project. With its hard lyrical reflection of isolation and suicide, “Trench” may be one of Twenty One Pilots’ best albums to date.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
On July 8, 1943, a gray haze crept through Los Angeles and sent the city into a frenzy. There were car accidents all over town. Children were sent to school in gas masks. Even Peaches, a donkey at the Griffith Park Zoo, was outfitted with some stylish goggles to prevent his eyes from watering. The Los Angeles Times referred to it as a “daylight dim out;” no one knew the reason for this change in air quality and politicians were worried. Some thought it was a gas attack from Japan, as the United States was entering its second year of heavy warfare in World War II. When it became clear that the Japanese weren’t the culprits, the situation was blamed on butadiene, then sulfur, but neither were correct. All of these dramatic effects were the result of a particularly bad bout of good old fashioned California smog. Though the city has not been shocked by smog in several decades, it is in danger of being taken by surprise yet again — because even though the state has made big strides in fighting air pollution, smog is on the rise yet again. 
Smog — the hazy air pollution that clings to downtown skyscrapers most mornings, reduces visibility in the surrounding mountains and gives L.A. sunsets their vibrance — is a weirdly normalized part of city life. Its prevalence has diminished significantly since that day in 1943, and in fact, Los Angeles’ air is far cleaner today, largely thanks to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. But the city still consistently holds the title of worst smog in the country, according to the American Lung Association. In addition, smog prevalence is slowly creeping upward, meaning that we, as a region, must crack down on smog again.
Though the word is a portmanteau of “smoke” and “fog,” smog actually refers to ozone, a chemical that is produced when industrial emissions are chemically altered by heat and sunlight. Breathing ozone triggers an inflammation in the body, which is linked to a whole host of health effects. Short-term exposure can lead to difficulty breathing and chest pain, respiratory infections and increased risk of asthma;  long-term exposure has been shown to increase risk of cognitive decline, heart disease and cancer. It’s a clear negative contributor to human health, not to mention the health of plants and animals, which is why it poses a threat. 
After that strange day in 1943, regulators figured out some of the major contributors to air pollution in greater L.A.: factories, backyard trash fires, farming operations and oil refineries. But the main contributor to air pollution in Southern California is the millions of cars and trucks that drive through it every day. In 1952, Caltech professor Arie Haagen-Smit wrote about the clear car-smog connection, but was vilified for his findings until people slowly began to accept that the big-bodied vehicles that defined the city were actively hurting it. It turned out that when a dense, car-loving population is combined with a dozen major freeways, pollution-trapping mountain ranges and hot, stagnant weather, the result is a stubborn, constant layer of smog. Though it is possible in any urbanized area, the geography and conditions surrounding L.A. seem to make it particularly susceptible. 
Over the next 30 years, statewide tailpipe emissions standards, industrial regulations and mandatory vehicle smog checks drove down air pollution, setting an example of eco-conscious legislation that the entire country followed. It was a major leap in the fight against pollution. But today, some of that progress seems to have been undone. 
Without a doubt, the air is far cleaner today than it was in the last century. In 2017, Los Angeles had 145 days of unhealthy air, according to the AQMD. Compare that to over 200 days of unhealthy air in the late 1980s, and it is clear that progress has been made. Peak smog levels have lowered as well, meaning that even when the air gets polluted, it’s not as polluted as it used to be. But it seems that the numbers are going up again. There were only 132 ozone violation days in 2016 and 113 in 2015, and though the year isn’t over yet, 2018 has already broken records for having the longest consecutive streak of days with ozone violations after 87 days, nearly three months, went by without a day of clean enough air.
What is so strange about the upswing in air pollution over the last few years is that it is concurrent with a massive slashing in greenhouse gas emissions. In July, the California Air Resources Board proudly announced that the state’s emissions had dropped 13 percent since their peak in 2004, back to the levels that they were in 1990. So while smog-causing emissions are going down, the incidence of smog itself is going up. 
Strange, until global warming is brought into the picture. You see, even as emissions have slowed, the area has been subject to more heat waves and higher average temperatures. Because heat aids in the formation of ozone, lower emissions can still create more pollution, all because of climate change. 
The fight against smog in Southern California has been long, but generally successful. Now that the area’s progress seems to have faltered, it is time to revise the playbook. Stricter regulations must be applied to industrial emissions, especially from the oil and transportation industries, and citizens and business owners alike should be given incentives to switch from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric and hybrid. Additionally, the state must continue to do all it can to stop climate change, before it negates all of the hard work that has already been put into the battle against air pollution.

According to the Center of Disease Control, cigarettes are responsible for about 480,000 deaths each year in America, and account for about 20 percent of the yearly death toll in the United States, as of 2014. The CDC estimates that over five million children in America today are expected to die prematurely from a smoking-related illness if the rate of tobacco use remains the same. 
If only there were a solution — some sort of nifty alternative that delivers nicotine in the same manner as a cigarette without harmful chemicals. 
Fortunately, the epidemic of tobacco-related illness and death does have a perfectly viable, and already existing, solution: the Juul. California shouldn’t be taxing Juuls to the point where they’re no longer accessible to people who need them most. 
The device, manufactured by Juul Labs, is a compact e-cigarette that resembles a flash drive. It consists of a small battery, into which juice pods can be inserted, and subsequently consumed via inhalation. The pods contain approximately 0.7 milliliters of e-liquid with 5 percent nicotine by weight and come in a variety of flavors, including mint, mango and fruit medley. The United Kingdom’s Department of Health reports that the Juul and products like it are at least 95 percent safer than cigarettes.
The Juul is much safer than cigarettes because it delivers nicotine to the body without combustion, a process found in smoking that produces tar and releases disease-causing chemicals like hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. With the Juul, however, the user receives a dose of nicotine, which in and of itself is nowhere near as harmful to one’s health, without ingesting the tar and harmful chemicals. As South African psychiatrist Mike Russell put it, “[People] smoke for [the] nicotine, but they die from the tar.”
The popularity of e-cigarettes like the Juul is on the rise, while cigarette use is declining. California, where about 11 percent of the population smokes cigarettes, should be thrilled. However, this is not the case.
The California government, in fact, treats the Juul as an equivalent to deadly cigarettes. Under Proposition 56, which was passed in 2016, each individual cigarette is subject to a $0.10 tax increase. This tax increase was then sloppily applied to Juul pods (and similar devices), bumping up the price up about $2 per pod. 
Proposition 56 resulted in an $8 increase for each pack of Juul pods, bringing the total up to nearly $30. The average price of a pack of Marlboro Reds in California is around $8. This is a stark contrast from prices in other states, like New York, where a pack of pods is about $17, and the average cigarette pack is around $15. 
It makes little sense for California — a state where according to tobaccofreekids.org, more than 40,000 individuals die each year from tobacco use — to slap such a heavy tax on the potentially life-saving Juul. It makes even less sense that they would do this while allowing cigarette prices to remain so low. 
Part of the revenue collected from the Proposition 56 tax goes toward tobacco use prevention. Essentially, the government is taking money from the users of a popular, tobacco-free market substitute for cigarettes, in order to put it back into preventing people from using tobacco. However, this practice is incredibly counterproductive.
Not only is this strategy ineffective in preventing tobacco use, but it also drives potential tobacco users back into tobacco use. The choice for nicotine addicts is this: Spend $25 on three packs of cigarettes, or $30 on one pack of Juul pods. The choice is relatively clear for any economic-minded consumer.
The state government ought to incentivize the purchase of Juul and similar devices instead of cigarettes in order to curb the tens of thousands of deaths each year that result from tobacco use. At the very least, the state shouldn’t tax a market substitute for cigarettes, which is estimated to be about 95 percent safer than cigarettes, at the same level it taxes cigarettes. If it’s a matter of revenue, split the difference; bump up the tax on actual tobacco cigarettes and decrease Juul pod prices so that they’re at least on par with one another.  
For the sake of public health, for the sake of the lives of millions of smokers across the state, state legislators must exclude Juul pods from the Proposition 56 tax. Juul is not part of the problem, but part of the solution.

Freshmen Estephanie Garcia and Talie Cloud are recipients of a $20,000 scholarship from Coca-Cola. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
In May, two incoming USC students were named among the 150 winners of the 2018 Coca-Cola scholarship program, an annual competition that selects students across the nation to receive a $20,000 college scholarship. 
As recipients of the scholarship, freshmen Talie Cloud and Estephanie Garcia attend various events and make media appearances to inform the community of the Dear Future Community Challenge in Los Angeles, which encourages young adults to submit ideas that increase the number of women in public service careers.
As part of the campaign, Cloud and Garcia attended a Los Angeles City Hall meeting last week and shadowed two female councilmembers, Nury Martinez and Monica Rodriguez, to promote the challenge. Cloud, a neuroscience major, said she learned about the challenges female councilmembers face in a male-dominated field.
“Hearing their experiences of things they were able to accomplish as women, and as women of color specifically, was really enlightening and [understanding] the power dynamics even within their personal relationships and how that’s shifted as a result of their service,” Cloud said.
Until Oct. 15, any person between 18 to 24 years old in Los Angeles can submit ideas for the challenge online, according to Carlos Illingworth, director of public affairs and communications for Coca-Cola North America. There are several other Dear Future Challenges held in different cities, as well as a national competition.
After reviewing the submissions, Coca-Cola will choose 17 winners and give $30,000 to local nonprofits that will work with the winners to make their ideas realities, Illingworth said.
Illingworth also spoke about why Coca-Cola created the Dear Future Community Challenge. 
“We’re very inspired by young adults and their energy and optimism and potential to give back and improve their communities,” Illingworth said. “So the goal of this challenge is to do just that -— to improve the local communities across the country and inspire young people to come up with solutions to address pressing issues, like getting women more involved in public service.”
Garcia, an environmental studies major, said the Dear Future Community Challenge in Los Angeles will bring more attention to gender gaps and disparities in fields like public service. 
“As we’ve been seeing politically, women have always been underrepresented,” Garcia said. “I think it’s important to have that perspective and have that voice … in the system so that [women] can bring in their experiences to change what they’ve seen that other men haven’t.”
Cloud said she also sees the importance of having more women in public service careers to represent female perspectives on issues like abortion and the wage gap. These women can also inspire the next generation of girls to enter male-dominated fields like the public service sector, Cloud explained.
“Ideally in society or in public power you want to see equal advantages for everyone to have access to the public sector and public leadership,” Cloud said. “It’s very important for girls growing up to have access to these role models and to see that it is a possibility for women.”

The Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Sciences canceled its Distinguished Lecture event, which was scheduled for Sunday, after the speaker dropped out of the Kansas City, Mo., mayoral race.
Jason Kander, who was set to run as a Democrat in Kansas City and speak at the event, announced that he would be dropping out of the race to treat his chronic PTSD and depression. 
Kander served as an Army Intelligence Officer in Afghanistan 11 years ago. Since then, Kander said that he has dealt with suicidal thoughts and other symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression but avoided seeking treatment.
“I’m done hiding this from myself and from the world,” Kander wrote in a statement published on his website. “When I wrote in my book that I was lucky to not have PTSD, I was just trying to convince myself. And I wasn’t sharing the full picture. I still have nightmares. I am depressed.”
After seeing the statement, Ali Bissonnette, chief of staff at USC Dornsife’s Center for the Political Future, said her team assumed the event would be canceled but contacted the event donors and Kander’s team to confirm. 
Robert Shrum, director of the Center for the Political Future, sent an email to students who  RSVP’d following Kander’s announcement. Shrum previously said that Kander had been selected to speak because of his service in the army and his political involvement. Before becoming a frontrunner in the Kansas City mayoral race, Kander was a former Secretary of State in Missouri and the Democratic nominee in the 2016 Missouri senate election. 
“He’s an outstanding person,” Shrum said. “[He’s] exactly the kind of person we should have for the lecture.”
Since the cancelation notices were sent out, Bissonnette said students have shown sympathy and understanding for Kander’ decision to focus on his mental health. 
“Most of the people I’ve spoken with have spoken words of support about [Kander’s] bravery in coming forward with his challenges and putting his own health and mental well-being first,” Bissonnette said. 
In his statement, Kander said that he plans to come back to politics after he goes through treatment. The politician wrote that he decided to be public about his struggles with PTSD and depression to help others who are facing similar struggles and encourage them to also seek treatment. 
“I hope it helps veterans and everyone else across the country working through mental health issues realize that you don’t have to try to solve it on your own,” Kander wrote. “Most people probably didn’t see me as someone that could be depressed and have had PTSD symptoms for over a decade, but I am and I have. If you’re struggling with something similar, it’s OK. That doesn’t make you less of a person.” 
Shrum said that he commends Kander for stepping away from politics to take time for himself. Shrum hopes Kander’s withdrawal and public statement will help more people understand PTSD and other mental health issues.
“A lot of politicians, a lot of people in public life would’ve just said, ‘I’m going to push ahead with my political career,’ and he has decided that he’s going to deal first with these problems and then come back to the political world,” Shrum said. “Whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, I think you have to admire him.”

The Arthur Bartner Band Pavilion officially held its open house Sunday for Spirit of Troy members to celebrate.
Located on the second floor of the Lyon Recreation Center, the Pavilion — which includes locker rooms, a tuba and drum room, a lounge area and an audiovisual system — is the most notable upgrade for the band since 1995. It opened at the start of the fall semester.
The lack of an adequate indoor practice space necessitated the development of the new facility, which is named after the band’s director.
“It’s nice to have a rehearsal space we can call our own because before we didn’t have a rehearsal space that wasn’t outdoors,” Spirit of Troy Director of Public Relations Brett Padelford said. “We basically had to go wherever we could.” 
The band had been previously situated in the basement of Stonier Hall. However, that space lacked  locker rooms and space.
“In our old spot at Stonier Hall downstairs in the basement, there was really no place for the band members to change or store their uniforms,” Padelford said. “We had people everywhere, trying to get ready [and] get into uniform.”
Bartner said he had been trying to get the band a new space since he started working with Spirit of Troy in 1970, but was impeded by a lack of funds.
“We outgrew [Stonier Hall] in the second year,” Bartner said. “I’d been … working through the bureaucracy [of the University] and couldn’t get the space, couldn’t get the funding, couldn’t get the donor.”
However, this changed when two students attended a discussion with then-President C. L. Max Nikias in 2016 to address the problems with the Stonier Hall location. 
Bartner explained that Nikias agreed to open up a new space for the band after visiting the cramped basement. Plans for the Bartner Pavilion began immediately in January 2017. 
“The students who put in all this time, 10 to 15 hours a week, deserve a home,”  Bartner said. “They deserve a rehearsal hall.”
According to Assistant Director of the Spirit of Troy Jacob Vogel, another feature of the Pavilion includes a surround-sound audiovisual system with a drop-down screen for the band to gather and critique past performances.
“[The Pavilion] shows that the University cares about [the band],” Padelford said. “Before, there was a sense that we were kind of stuck in the basement, that the students didn’t matter as much. Now that we have our own space, [it] really shows how much that the band is important on campus.”
Bartner said after working with the band for nearly 50 years,   he considers the opening of the Pavilion a personal triumph. 
“This is a dream come true for me, “Bartner said. “Every time I go over there, I’m in awe. It’s wonderful.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of the story incorrectly stated that the Arthur Bartner Pavilion opened on Sunday. The pavilion held an open house on Sunday, and has opened at the start of the fall semester.
