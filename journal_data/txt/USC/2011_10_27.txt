The USC Spirit Leaders will debut a 40-foot banner to roll over student section Saturday at the student section to raise student spirit.
A few minutes before kickoff against Stanford, spirit leaders in cooperation with Trojan Knights and Helenes will walk to the top of section 23 and direct students to hold their hands up for the banner to roll over them.
The idea came from banners typically rolled over crowds at other sporting events, said Shana Schwartz, associate head coach of the Spirit Leaders.
“In the past we’ve done card stunts and other things that haven’t been successful,” Schwartz said. “We had seen the banner at some professional soccer games and really began to look into this as one of our new ideas to raise school spirit along with the large trojan head flag we run out during games.”
The spirit leaders hope for the banner to appear at every home game.
“Hopefully students will want to come earlier to be a part of this new tradition,” Spirit Leader Captain Emily Gee said. “I hope for this to be a symbol that our student section is there and supportive no matter what.”
Josh DeMilta, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism, said the banner could help students show support for USC during the game.
“A banner would help the student section be more spirited and I’m all for the idea,” DeMilta said. “We need something like this to become more cohesive as a group and really show our presence at the games.”
Schwartz said she has been satisfied with the school spirit of the student section so far and believes this will only make it better.
“Oh fun! Cheering against a school that a good number of your students were rejected from.
Thanks, but no thanks.”
Oh ho ho, smugness coming from a school infamous for its envy of a certain crimson institution. Couldn’t the alumni of that school mock you in the exact same manner, Cardinal?  
It’s easy to be smug until you realize there’s always someone better than you.
Congratulations. You’ve graduated from geek to insufferable in record time. How did you live with yourself during the all too many years as football doormat?
Another good use for the new banner:  USC can hide in shame under it after Stanford whoops their a**!!!
Your exceptionalism keeps you small and lonely. Enjoy the solitude. USC and Stanford among many many institutes foster inclusion. You are welcome back to society when you rehabilitate that mean streak of yours.
Oh fun!
Cheering against a school that a good number of your students were rejected from.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Unless you have worked in the admissions office of both USC and Stanford, your comment is merely mindless arrogance. As the offspring of a Louisiana Trojan, I find such ungraciousness startling.

Women’s involvement in the science, technology, engineering and mathematical subjects is higher than ever, as a greater proportion of women have received master’s degrees in those fields than before.
There was a 5.4 percent increase in master’s degrees awarded to female students in biological and agricultural sciences and an 11.1 percent increase in the number of master’s degrees awarded to female students in health science, according to the Council of Graduate Studies.
Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
This marks a trend in higher education, where women are excelling in fields that were traditionally dominated by men.
Melora Sundt, associate dean for academic programs, said the increase in involvement of women in these fields is expected to change some long-standing biases. She said having more women in these fields of study can help them serve as role models, and become the rule rather than the exception in these fields.
She said, however, that though more women are entering the STEM fields in a greater number, they have not had an impact in all of them.
“You’ll find different proportions by type of major. Physics probably hasn’t reached parity yet,” Sundt said. “So, while the overall proportion may have shifted, it could be due to gains in particular areas, while others have remained the same or even decreased.”
Alex White, an undeclared sophomore who plans to attend medical school, said she often feels the presence of the biases against women in her math and science classes.
“[Men] look at me like I am not competent and like I don’t know what I am doing,” White said. “It’s unfair but you cannot let people’s biases deter you from achieving your goals. You have to hold your own and not let that discourage you.”
Sonia Hua, a junior majoring in gerontology on the pre-health track, said she was aware of the historical lack of women in the health sciences field, but they never prevented her from pursuing her goals. Instead, she said they made her more determined.
“This bias hasn’t directly affected me in any way, I mean, no one approached me and told me I couldn’t be a doctor because I’m a female,” Hua said. “It shows both men and women that females can accomplish whatever they set out to achieve and that gender is not a factor. This is good news for me because there are positive statistics to support my decision to enter this field.”
Michelle Leclair, a junior majoring in chemical engineering with an emphasis in petroleum engineering, said the bias against women has always existed but, as more women enter the science fields, that gender bias has disappeared.
“There is a certain drive in myself and other engineers to compete with the men or out-compete in order to stand equally and earn that respect,” Leclair said. “A lot of times, especially in the student program, there is more of a sense of community, whereas, in the past, we have been more competitive. But I feel that has changed with the newer generation. The more women that we have interested in science, the stronger candidates we have and no longer will there be that admission generosity for women. That can help eliminate the gender bias.”
Dana Levin, a senior majoring in the biological sciences, said she disagrees. Levin said she has never felt the effect of the bias in her studies and the majority of the people in her area of study are women.
“As more women enter the scientific field, we have to open our eyes and see that the gender bias still persists, even though more women are graduating with science degrees than men,” Levin said. “We need to see that women are indeed interested in science, but somehow this is getting lost after these women graduate. I am very happy that we have become more accepting of women in the scientific field, but there is still a long way to go before there is no longer a gender bias.”
I think using the term “awarded” in your title was the wrong verb to use as it gives a connotations that they are given these degrees rather than really earning them.
Editor!!!!  Please!!!
Look at the headline.  Does the subject agree with the verb?
“Science degrees awarded to women increases”
Subject = science degrees awarded to women
Verb = increases; should’ve been “increase”
Nonetheless, STEM academic paths are much more rigorous and competitve than your typical BA, humanities, or whatever futile major you’re pursuing.

Community reaction to The Village at USC, a residential and recreational plaza planned to replace USC-owned property north of Jefferson Boulevard, was mixed at an open house at the Galen Center Thursday.
Cardinal Gardens, Century Apartments, the current University Village and other surrounding buildings will be torn down to construct a center that aims to modernize the area. The Village will include student housing, shops, restaurants and green space, according to its website.
Community members attended an open house at the Galen Center Thursday for The Village at USC. - Engie Salama | Daily Trojan
“The primary goal is to really enhance and improve the quality of life while we are living and going to school at USC,” said David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations for The Village. “We really want to create the best college culture for current and incoming students and we feel The Village can assist in that.”
The plans for the center designate 300,000 square feet for classroom, artistic and presentation space, which Galaviz said is intended to improve the academic atmosphere. Additional housing in The Village for students, faculty and staff is intended to encourage students to informally meet with their professors in new locations.
USC plans to furnish the reinvented Jefferson Boulevard with more lighting and possibly build a Dept. of Public Safety substation within the center. The Village will also be closed off from cars, allowing protected transportation on the walkways or bike lanes.
Residents shared different attitudes toward USC’s expected redevelopment of Jefferson Boulevard.
Silvio Aguilar, who has lived west of campus for 28 years, said he wants to still be able to shop at The Village, as he currently buys groceries at Superior Grocers.
“I don’t know if it will be good for the community or just for students,” Aguilar said. “I am still not sure [after the presentation] if the businesses are going to be at the right price level for community members. We’ll just have to see.”
Some students also expressed concern regarding the type of stores that will be in the plaza.
“The most useful things for students would be clothing stores, restaurants and a better movie theater,” said Sydney Laux, a senior majoring in theatre. “But if they only cater to high-end students, they will lose community support and involvement because it will be too expensive.”
Jean Smith, who has lived in the area for more than 40 years, said she was excited for the potential new stores.
The university launched a website this month detailing plans for The Village at USC, a residential and shopping plaza. - Photo courtesy of USC
“They said they’re building a bookstore. Now, I have to drive all the way to Del Amo [Fashion Center],” Smith said. “It’ll be great if I don’t have to go all the way to Torrance if I just want to buy a book for my daughter.”
She also said she is happy with the proposed plan overall.
“The traffic on Hoover Street can be dangerous [for pedestrians] and shutting down the street will make it a lot safer,” Smith said. “[The Village] is a good thing because it will bring jobs to the community and keep kids on campus.”
The Village intends to accommodate the community’s financial interests by providing an estimated 8,000 jobs in construction and 4,000 permanent positions.
Its completion will take at least eight years. Construction will tentatively begin in mid-2012, according to The Village website.
The progress of the project can be followed on The Village at USC’s twitter and website.
“The Village will only be successful if we have a mix of students and those from the surrounding community involved,” Galaviz said.
I’m excited about new opportunities around here, especially if there really will be a variety of price ranges catered to. I’m putting myself through school, so I really need to economize.  I’m unlikely to be frequenting designer clothing stores (for example), though I have no objection to them being in the mix.  I wonder if our area’s zoning would allow a Target or something similar?
This is a no brainer…. the current site is a dump without any cultural value.  Having updated, cleaner, safer shopping is good for all.  And surely it will provide retail at various price points. We support this 100%
Who cares about the current population? They’ve had 50 years to do something with the area and blew it. Maybe if USC builds up the area and gives some of them jobs then they’ll stop stabbing, shooting, and stealing from our students all the time
You are idiot. No one is “stabbing” or “shooting” USC students “all the time.” Bikes do sometimes get stolen.  Nevertheless, there are many wonderful people in the area around USC. I certainly hope you get expelled from USC during your senior year so that no one will ever think of you as a Trojan.
well well well, if it isn’t the Grand Old University of Southern California at work with trying to gentrif- I mean “revitilize” the area so that it could serve the interests of the elit- I mean the well rounded diverse population of USC and the ever stabalized and benefiting community of South L.A.

Someone ought to look into revitalizing their spelling. And using the same “cutoff adjectiv– I mean [euphemism]” trope twice in the same sentence? Really? No wonder UCLA continues to slide in the rankings.

It’s an unexpected thought: The USC women’s soccer team has a chance to emerge from this weekend with a .500 record in Pac-12 play.
Homecoming · Senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge, a native of Golden, Colo., leads the Women of Troy with seven assists this year. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
To think USC (6-11, 3-5) is now fighting to finish in the middle of the conference says a lot about its season. But even more so, it’s surprising because just two weeks ago the Women of Troy had lost eight straight games and found themselves winless in conference play.
Since then, they have won three straight. And if they can knock off Utah on Friday and Colorado on Sunday, they will be 5-5 in the conference going into their final game of the season next weekend at UCLA.
“I don’t really think about that,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “Our record is not indicative of the talent on this team.”
Two weeks ago USC was dead last in the Pac-12. Heading into this weekend the Women of Troy stand in eighth place with a chance to move up to sixth  with a pair of wins and a little help. Despite this, the team still feels it has a lot to play for.
“Our energy, our confidence, those have come a long way,” Khosroshahin said. “Our practice is still like we’re preparing for the tournament. Because that’s what you got to do to be competitive.”
Khosroshahin expects the depth of the Pac-12 conference to be on display this weekend. Utah (8-8-1, 4-4-0) has held its own in its first season in the Pac-12, including knocking off then-No. 19 Oregon State as well as Oregon in Eugene — two teams that defeated USC earlier in the season. USC, however, is 3-0 all-time against Utah.
The Utes are led by forward Erin Dalley’s five goals and two assists, and goalkeeper Hannah Turpen, who has recorded 54 saves and allowed just 22 goals in 16 contests.
Colorado (4-10-2, 1-6-1) notched its first Pac-12 win of the season last weekend by topping California — another squad that bested USC earlier this year.
The Buffaloes, meanwhile, are paced by forwards Anne Stuller and Kate Russell, who both have four goals apiece on the year. The Women of Troy are also undefeated against Colorado boasting a 2-0 record.
Despite USC’s past success against the two squads, the coaching staff understands the importance of taking these games seriously.
“We’re going into it like any other conference weekend,” Khosroshahin said. “Two tough matches on the road.”
But as always, Khosroshahin’s focus is steadfast on his own squad.
“We’re on a roll here now,” he said. “We’re more cohesive now than we were in the middle part of the year.  And I think winning definitely has something to do with it.”
USC squares off against Utah at 6 p.m. on Friday and faces Colorado on Sunday at noon.
Best Wishes to Coach Ali & Women of Troy. Fight ON!
We got your back…..win the last 3 and Tournament may still be possible

This weekend the USC cross-country team will travel to Arizona to compete in the Pac-12 championships.
The 6-kilometer race will be held at the Wigwam Golf Resort in Litchfield, Ariz.
USC will send seven runners to the championships: junior Shelby Buckley, sophomore Jaclyn Walles, redshirt freshman Katie DeYoung and freshmen Erica Capellino, Erin Robinson, Kira Soderstrom and Shannon Byrne. Of those seven, Buckley is the only USC participant who holds conference meet experience, but USC coach Tom Walsh is confident USC is well prepared.
“We’ve been resting this past week and getting the girls’ legs fresh and ready for the competition on Saturday,” Walsh said. “Everyone is excited. It’s going to be the best conference meet in the country.”
Five of the top 11 teams in the country will  race this weekend. Washington is ranked No. 2 in the country, though No. 8 Stanford has won the cross-country conference title in 13 of the past 15 seasons. USC will also race against No. 5 Arizona, No. 10 California, No. 11 Oregon and No. 16 Colorado. The Pac-12 is arguably one of the most competitive divisions in the country when it comes to cross-country.
“I’m not going to make any predictions about our placement because the only thing I can control is how our girls do,” Walsh said.  “There’s no defense in the sport of cross-country. We can only worry about ourselves and do what we can do.”
Walsh notes DeYoung is one runner to watch during the race. Though DeYoung has not been a major contributor in the season so far, she has performed consistently and will be an asset to the team in Litchfield.
“She’s been behind the radar and quietly doing everything I’ve asked her to do,” Walsh said. “She’s really picked up the pace in practice and has made great progress.”
After the Pac-12 championships, USC will head to the NCAA regional championships in Palo Alto, Calif., on Nov. 12. Runners will be able to qualify for the NCAA national championships at the meet.
“We’ll evaluate to see where we are after [Arizona],” Walsh said. “Sometimes we send a team [to regionals] if we think that team is good enough to qualify for nationals, and sometimes we send individuals. This meet will be a deciding factor.”

The Women of Troy’s 12-match winning streak will be put to perhaps its toughest test this weekend, as the No. 4 USC women’s volleyball teams travels to Northern California to play No. 2 California and No. 5 Stanford.
Stat stuffer · Sophomore outside hitter Katie Fuller notched a combined 24 kills and 16 digs against Stanford and California last month at home. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
There’s a clutter at the top of both the Pac-12 and the national volleyball rankings, and this weekend’s conference matches could do a lot to create some separation between the teams — or muddle the picture even more.
USC (17-3, 12-1) and No. 6 UCLA (18-3, 11-2) are playing California (21-2, 11-2) and Stanford (16-3, 10-3) on the road this weekend in a two-day stretch that will almost certainly have a hand in determining the Pac-12 conference race.
“It’s an opportunity for us to separate, and it’s an opportunity for Stanford and Cal to get into the top rung,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “It helps us if UCLA plays well up there. But we need to win our games, too.”
USC swept both teams in three sets earlier this season at Galen Center, but both squads boast undefeated home records.
Junior outside hitter Katie Fuller says the team has to play even better than they have been to get two wins this weekend.
“Both teams going into the second round have improved a lot,” Fuller said. “Hopefully we can use what we learned in the first round to beat them again.”
The Women of Troy begin the weekend by playing the Cardinal, who have gone on an eight-match winning streak of its own since losing to USC on Sept. 24.
Stanford leads the conference in digs (17.33 digs per set) and ranks second with 3.20 blocks per set.
“Last time we didn’t play very well against Stanford, and they did a lot of very good things against us and we still won all three games,” Haley said. “We have to play a lot better [this time] if we’re going to be successful.”
Sophomore Rachel Williams leads the Cardinal in kills (4.39 kills per set), which ranks fourth in the Pac-12.
“I look for this to be a titanic battle,” Haley said. “[With them] being at home, I expect them to dig more balls, and for there to be more rallies [than last time].”
On Saturday night, the Women of Troy will play the Golden Bears with each team possibly having a chance to claim the No. 1 spot in the country.
Despite being ranked fourth, USC has the second-most No. 1 votes in the country, behind No. 1 Nebraska (17-1), who jumped to the top spot this week from No. 4 after upsetting previously top-ranked Illinois, which is No. 3 in the polls.
But before thinking about rankings, the Women of Troy will have to get past Cal’s vaunted defense, which ranks first in the Pac-12 in opponents’ hitting percentage (.121), second in digs (16.93 digs per set) and third in blocks (2.99 blocks per set).
USC hasn’t had to face top-notch opponents in a few weeks now, but Haley doesn’t think his squad will be caught off-guard.
“I don’t think we’ll have trouble getting focus back,” Haley said. “Nobody wants to go out of there with an L, and we know on the road that we really have to be good.”
The players seem to have high expectations for the trip.
“Going into their house and beating both of them 3-0, 3-0 would be ideal,” Fuller said. “Obviously that’s a challenge, [but] that would put us ahead of them in the running for the Pac-12 championship.”
Haley knows this weekend will have implications on the conference race, but he’s downplaying the importance of any single weekend in the long run.
“Every week in the next five weeks is an opportunity,” Haley said. “It’ll be great competition. The more we can take advantage of winning on the road, the better.”
USC’s matches against Stanford and California will take place on Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m.

The last time the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team faced Stanford — the semifinals of the SoCal tournament — the Cardinal handed the Trojans their first loss in 11 months, snapping a 22-game winning streak.
Revenge · Freshman driver Kostas Genidounias, who ranks 18th in the MPSF in scoring, looks to get USC off to a strong start against Stanford. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
USC (13-2, 4-0) has responded with four wins in the last five contests since the loss, and as the No. 3 Cardinal (14-3, 3-1) visit McDonald’s Swim Stadium for a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation bout, revenge is on the minds of many Trojans.
“They took it to us in a couple of different areas in the SoCal tournament, which they obviously learned when we played them in the NorCal tournament,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said.
The Trojans did also manage Stanford earlier in mid-September — a 12-5 rout in the semifinals of the NorCal tournament. But when the two square off for the third Saturday, it will count toward the MPSF standings.
“We are 1-1 with Stanford so we look forward to this matchup to rank us in the MPSF and gauge us from where we were when we played them last,” Dennerley said.
Last weekend USC topped No. 5 UC Santa Barbara with the help of a hat trick from sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie and eight saves from Dennerley. Now riding a four-game win streak, the Trojans head into their game against Stanford knowing from past experience it won’t be an easy challenge.
“They know us, we know them and it will really be a battle of different tactics and intensity,” Davie said. “It is good to be at home and have that home advantage.”
Offense has proven to be key in the Trojans’ success this season, notching an average of 12.07 goals per game — fourth best in the MPSF, with No. 4 California leading the standings with 12.83 goals per contest.
“Our offense’s greatest strength is our [passing],” Davie said. “When our passes are good, we have good assists and no goalie can stop us.”
In addition to the up-and-coming Davie, senior driver Peter Kurzeka has been essential to the Trojans’ goal-scoring this season. Ranked 13th in the conference in goals, he averages 1.73 goals a game. Freshman driver Kostas Genidounias, ranked 18th in goals, has also proven a force to be reckoned with in his first season with the program.
Defensively, the team has relied on Dennerley’s command of the net to provide leadership. The career saves record holder at USC, he expressed excitement on being able to face Stanford once again.
“It’s exciting to play such a tough team in front of a home crowd,” Dennerley said. “We hopefully can address the areas we went wrong in the SoCal tournament and play a much better game [tomorrow].”
Following its game against Stanford at 2 p.m., USC hosts Pomona-Pitzer at 4 p.m. The Trojans are 5-0 all-time against the Sagehens, with their last win coming in 2009.
“[Pomona-Pitzer] has some young guys and an up-and-coming program,” Dennerley said. “They are going to be looking forward to the challenge of playing us and who knows what to expect from that.”

I remember USC throttling opponents, stepping on their throats relentlessly. The offense was unstoppable. The defense was stifling.
Last weekend I thought I was dreaming, really. It was almost like yesteryear.
The USC offense stormed out of the gates on offense against Notre Dame, moving the ball almost seamlessly, having its way against its opponent and scoring almost at will. The defense held the Fighting Irish to two straight three-and-outs — gasp — shutting down a running game ranked 17th in the country and one of the top wide receivers in the nation in Michael Floyd.
Yes, the type of USC football we are all accustomed to is back.
The first two offensive drives were picture perfect: Senior tailback Marc Tyler bruising Notre Dame defenders and junior tailback Curtis McNeal providing the perfect complement of speed and shiftiness out of the backfield á la “Smash and Dash,” LenDale White and Reggie Bush.
And that running game set up the passing game.
On the Trojans’ second drive of the game, junior quarterback Matt Barkley hit freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, then sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods and freshman tight end Xavier Grimble in succession. Sounds familiar, right? It brought back images of Matt Leinart connecting with guys like Dwyane Jarrett, Steve Smith and Mike Williams.
The running game clicked and opened up the passing game. The offense ran like a well-oiled machine and the Trojans couldn’t be stopped en route to a two-touchdown win.
Two drives, two scores, an early 14-0 lead. USC silenced the crowd. It took the energy out of Notre Dame Stadium. At that point in the contest, the Trojans were primed to hang almost 60 points on the Irish and force a shutout.
Shocking? Yes. Unbelievable? Not quite.
Many of us, myself included, probably envisioned a team like this. With a squad loaded with five- and four-star recruits, there shouldn’t be any reason why this team can’t perform as it has been.
In its last two games against California and Notre Dame, USC has won by a combined score of 61-26.
Through seven games, the offense has finally found its mojo.
We know Barkley and Woods are great. But Lee is turning heads, too. The other Serra High standout? Converted tailback George Farmer is making contributions to a running game that has finally found itself: Tyler and McNeal are keeping defenses honest and they’re providing the perfect balance for an offense thought to be one-dimensional earlier in the year.
Now the defense is starting to play like the unit USC coach Lane Kiffin envisioned when he first took over the reins of the football program. In their last two games, the Trojans have won the turnover battle by a margin of 8-1. They limited a Notre Dame rushing attack just 41 yards on the ground. They’re in the right spots at the right times and coming up with loose balls at opportune times. And they’ve done it on the road, not once but twice.
More importantly, they’re confident. USC has that swagger, that confidence, almost that aura about them now. This team knows it can win. A big rivalry win against Notre Dame can do a lot. A modest winning streak during a sanctioned season can do wonders.
For all the criticism the defense has had to endure, for all the finger-pointing the coaching staff has had to take and for all the unanswered questions fans kept asking and wondering, that time is no more.
The fans sense it, the students sense it. Fewer than 1,000 tickets remain for Saturday’s contest against No. 4 Stanford. Sure, the matchup might warrant it, but the Trojans are rolling. They are playing exceptionally well. They deserve the attention.
ESPN College GameDay is drinking the Kool Aid, too. For the second straight year, it will be setting up shop outside the peristyle entrance to the Coliseum. For the first time in what almost seems like an eternity, USC football is once again the talk of the town. The Trojans are right back in the national discussion as it has always been and always should be.
Enjoy the ride. USC football has returned to South Central.

Reggie and Lendale were “Thunder and Lightning” not “Smash and Dash.”
But that was Notre DSame, so it does not mean that much. But if the Trojans are able to do it to Stanford. And then go into Eugene repeat this. Yes we would be on our way back.
Notre Lame
Chicago Tree that’s the point in spite of the best efforts of your team Notre Dame AD, Paul Dee, and the NCAA. With the lynching of the Trojans on false evidence leading to unjust penalty’s. The Trojans are about to be your worst nightmare. If Matt Barkley returns they could end up in Miami next year, delivering a south central beat down the SEC’s best on a national stage. And to be honest it would be fitting after how they were done.
“Golden days”.. newsflash, you guys are on PROBATION!

Thursday marked USC’s last tune-up before its much anticipated matchup against Stanford on Saturday. Much of the talk in this contest has been about quarterback Andrew Luck, the All-American candidate and likely first overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft.
Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey, who is coming off a dominant performance against Notre Dame where he held the Irish’s star receiver Michael Floyd to just four catches for 28 yards, knows that Luck is a great passer, but he is aware there is much more to the Cardinal offense than just the star signal caller.
“I mean, they’re a great offense. They’ve been playing great lately,” Robey said. “Andrew Luck is an awesome player.”
Robey said the key to stopping Luck is to force him to make mistakes, which is difficult considering he has thrown only two interceptions on the year.
“[We need to] capitalize off Luck’s mistakes,” Robey said. “He’s not perfect, but he’s still a great player. He’s a veteran quarterback and we’re going be mixing it up on him in all types of different ways.”
—
The team is looking forward to coming home after tough road tests in California and Notre Dame. The Trojans are expecting an electric atmosphere, one that will make it tough for Stanford to play its game.
“It’s great to be back home, especially knowing that you got the home crowd with you,” Robey said. “That’s a big plus.”
 
Quick hits
– Neither redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris, who is suffering from a shoulder injury, nor freshman tailback George Farmer, who is suffering from a sprained ankle, practiced Thursday. Their status for Saturday is unknown.
– Freshman kicker Andre Heidari was limited Thursday and will be a “game-time decision,” according to USC coach Lane Kiffin. Heidari injured his ankle during a kickoff return against Notre Dame.

Lane Kiffin knows it won’t be easy. Not on Saturday. Not against a team that has won each of its last 10 games by at least 25 points.
USC’s second-year coach understands his team, winners of its last two games at California and Notre Dame by a combined 35-point margin, faces a challenge and beating No. 4 Stanford (7-0, 5-0) remains another issue.
“Somehow they have found a way to be playing even better than they were last year,” Kiffin said.
Last year Stanford finished 12-1 overall and No. 4 in the Associated Press top-25 poll.
Riding a modest three-game winning streak, No. 20 USC (6-1, 3-1) hosts the Cardinal on Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in a nationally televised primetime showdown.
“Stanford’s one of the best teams in the country,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “This is one of the few games that has a lot of hype, but I think it deserves every bit of it.”
At least one reason for the added attention might be the pair of quarterbacks scheduled to be on display Saturday night. Stanford boasts the Heisman Trophy frontrunner in Andrew Luck, who has completed more than 70 percent of his passes for 1,888 yards, 20 touchdowns and just three interceptions through seven games this season.
“I don’t know how you could find a more efficient quarterback that’s ever played college football,” Kiffin said of the third-year starter. “For two straight years, he has been phenomenal on third down and you look at this year, they’re 100 percent in the red zone. That’s hard to do.”
Similarly, USC’s junior signal caller, Matt Barkley, has amassed a rather impressive statline of his own with 2,006 passing yards, 19 touchdowns and four interceptions.
Barkley has been aided by the play of his wide receivers: sophomore Robert Woods and freshman Marqise Lee, who have hauled in eight and four touchdowns, respectively, this season. Woods, who has been battling a sprained ankle all week, and Lee, who is dealing with a sprained shoulder, have been hampered by injuries in recent weeks but are expected to play against Stanford.
Though much of the talk surrounding Saturday’s matchup has centered on Luck and Barkley, the running game could prove a determining point.
In its last game against then-No. 25 Washington, the Cardinal finished with a school-record 446 rushing yards in a 65-21 rout  of the Huskies. And currently, only 16 teams average more yards on the ground per game than Stanford, which averages 219 per contest.
Despite that “run-first” mentality, only Houston (345) has scored more points than Stanford (340) this season.
“That’s so unusual — to find a team that is so run-heavy,” Kiffin said of the Cardinal’s prolific offense. “Usually because the clock keeps running and because of the time of possession, you can’t score as many points.”
Three weeks ago, it would have seemed as if USC’s chances of stopping Stanford, which has given up just two sacks all season, would be near-impossible. In an Oct. 1 game against Arizona, which had just one win at the time, the defense allowed 41 points, marking the first time in program history it had given up more than 40 points in consecutive games — it gave up 43 at Arizona State the week before.
But in its last two contests —against Cal and Notre Dame — USC has allowed two offensive touchdowns and has forced eight turnovers. Additionally, after giving up 41 rushing yards against the Fighting Irish, USC’s defense ranks 11th nationally in rushing yards per game.
USC’s own rushing attack has come on strong as of late. Against Notre Dame, with junior tailback Curtis McNeal serving as the team’s starter, the Trojans finished with 219 rushing yards — the most they have had in any game this season. Against the Irish, McNeal had arguably his best game as a Trojan, rushing for 188 yards on 24 carries.
“I think just finally — midway through the season, having a consistent offensive line really helped,” junior left tackle Matt Kalil said. “We have to have the same focus we had against Notre Dame.”
Last year’s game, however, was all about offense, as both teams combined for 72 points and 976 total yards in the Cardinal’s two-point victory. The game ended on a 30-yard field goal from kicker Nate Whitaker as time expired.
As Barkley knows well, whoever ends up with the ball last might leave with a victory.
“It really comes down to who controls the ball better — who manages the game, who doesn’t turn the ball over and who can drive it down the field and hold the ball for long periods of time,” Barkley said.
Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m. and will be televised by ABC.

If you’re a parent on the USC campus this weekend, junior quarterback Matt Barkley is the kind of guy you’d love your daughter to date or your son to be close friends with.
Unquestioned leader · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley remains one of the top signal callers in the nation this season with 19 touchdown passes and four interceptions. On Saturday, he will lead USC into battle looking to upend No. 4 Stanford, led by quarterback Andrew Luck. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
He’s genial, mature beyond his years, has a million-dollar right arm and a Hallmark smile to go along with it. More importantly, Barkley possesses a rare blend of heart and character that gets lost in the negativity that envelops today’s world of college athletics.
“This position is as good as it gets in college football,” Barkley said. “Playing at a high school where two former Heisman Trophy winners [John Huarte and Matt Leinart] had gone previously, I was used to this kind of attention. But I knew that the spotlight would only get magnified playing the position at USC. But who wouldn’t want this? It’s a dream.”
Ordinarily, you’d expect the face of a university’s athletic program to be overwhelmed the week before the biggest game of his season. Not Barkley.
Instead, the blond, blue-eyed quarterback from Orange County has been roaming throughout Heritage Hall this week looking for anyone he can find to serenade with his acoustic versions of the Doobie Brothers and Jason Mraz.
For most college students, a life filled with more interviews and film sessions than midterms would be a burden, but for Barkley, it’s a blessing.
“I’m a third-year starter who has been in almost every situation you could ask for,” Barkley said. “So, there is nothing that gets me jittery. I have always been a calm person off the field, and that certainly translates between the white lines.”
Tomorrow’s opponent, No. 4 Stanford, might be the most dynamic team on both sides of the football — 48.6 points per game to 12.6 points allowed per game — the junior has faced, but during his time at USC, Barkley doesn’t bat an eye.
“I’ve been forced to handle more circumstances than the average college quarterback because of the media in Los Angeles, the sanctions and the limelight that comes with lining up under center at this university,” Barkley said. “Every game for us is a bowl game, and this is just one opportunity of 12. It’s going to be a big atmosphere, with all of the hype, but it’s also a chance for us to go in as underdogs, with no pressure at all, and shock the world.”
With this week’s matchup pitting Barkley against the Cardinal’s consensus NFL No. 1 overall pick, quarterback Andrew Luck, the natural inclination is to drudge up old questions of whether Barkley will join the NFL draft class of 2012.
But for a guy who would rather spend his winter break working with underprivileged kids and prisoners in Nigeria — as Barkley did last year — than on the sun-soaked, 70-degree beaches of Southern California, the future can wait. He’s living in the moment and loving every minute of it.
“This experience has been everything and more,” Barkley said. “Regardless of what’s happened in the past, this has all been a dream come true for me. Being able to wear cardinal and gold, to play for this university, it’s something that’s hard to describe. I couldn’t have asked for a better college experience. I’ve loved every second of it.”
Though the charismatic 21-year-old has done virtually everything the program could ask of him as its unofficial poster child, the lasting question regarding Barkley’s tenure at USC will come down to what he does on the grass of the Coliseum. It’s a question that through seven games (6-1 record with 2,006 yards passing, 19 touchdowns and four interceptions) Barkley has certainly worked toward answering.
“This year I feel completely comfortable with the offense and taking control of the game,” said Barkley, who broke a single-game school record against Arizona with 468 passing yards. “I’m not really looking for video game numbers, as long as we are winning in clean fashion. That means dedicating myself to the game when no one else is watching, constantly looking for deficiencies in my game, whether it’s how I’m holding the football, footwork or my grasp of the overall offensive scheme.”
Regardless of the season statistics, bowl victories and revenue dollars he generates, when all is said and done — whether that’s in two months or in 14 — Barkley’s name and impact will resonate at the university long after he leaves.
He might be closer to becoming a Davey O’Brien Award finalist than a Heisman Trophy winner. He might take part in more Emerald Bowl celebrations than Rose Parades. He might stay three years instead of four.
But none of that will matter.
Because, during one of the darkest hours in the athletic program’s history, it was Barkley, as much with his poise as his performance, who let the USC faithful realize that this time would only be temporary.
In the big picture, that will be worth much more than a game-winning touchdown pass or a mouth full of roses.
“At the end of the day, I hope people just remember my character, those attributes of a Trojan that have made me who I am today,” Barkley said. “That I love this school, love playing football, love walking through campus, love the people here. This is a truly special place and I’m definitely ready for what lies ahead because of it.”
Matt Barkley is a young man any university would be glad to have as its public face.
Cheaters never prosper!
Trolls have miserable and pathetic lives!
Allez-vous en,salope!

As children, we embraced Halloween as a night of spooky thrills. We bravely tramped through the neighborhood, demanding candy and creeping past scary skeleton displays, only to shriek our heads off when the display turned out to be the neighbor’s evil teenage son.
Today’s costumes tend to be more risque, and booze tends to replace candy.
Regardless of age, we all find a way to honor Halloween. Films are a great way to get in the All Hallow’s Eve mood. Whether one prefers comedies, horror or a little of both, some films have come to encapsulate the Halloween spirit.
Trick ’r Treat
Few films embody the spirit of Halloween as well as Trick ‘r Treat does. Four stories loosely intertwine on All Hallow’s Eve, from a group of children checking out the site of a tragic school bus accident, to an innocent Anna Paquin, whose sister wants her to embrace her sexy side. The stories are all connected by a creepy masked trick-or-treater. Trick ‘r Treat is funny, sardonic and creepy enough for a few jumps.
The Company of Wolves
The Brothers Grimm are notorious for their dark fairytales. In reality, they often softened the original stories and nixed the sexier elements. The Company of Wolves takes Little Red Riding Hood and restores the connection between dark wolves and dark men.
Presented, by a wise grandmother, as a dreamy series of stories, the film focuses on the message that the worst wolves are hairy on the inside. The film’s Red Riding Hood can’t help but be taken in when she meets a charming hunter. Though the film features one of the creepiest werewolf transformations ever, it’s more moody than scary. It’s beautiful and unique, and one of Neil Jordan’s lesser-known works.
The Nightmare Before Christmas
The opening song “This is Halloween” perfectly describes why we love a brush with the creepy once a year. Disney’s dark darling follows a charismatic skeleton in a mid-life crisis that wants to recreate Christmas for morbid Halloween Town. It’s a die-hard cult classic, while also incredibly charming for those who haven’t seen it before.
Sleepy Hollow
Before Sweeney Todd, Burton got his gory kicks with Sleepy Hollow, his live-action take on the Washington Irving short story. Johnny Depp plays a neurotic constable in 1799 sent to a remote Dutch village to battle a headless horseman, played by a needle-toothed Christopher Walken. The film is morbid, bloody, funny and a perfect film for Halloween.
Bram Stoker’s Dracula
The festivities of Halloween can be heady, especially when you find out the punch bowl is more than just Kool-Aid. Francis Ford Coppola’s take on Dracula is sumptuous and baroque and never cops out on its melodramatic delivery. Coppola creates a dream world set across London and Transylvania, and Gary Oldman’s portrayal is a sexy nightmare.
American Psycho
Fright extends far beyond ghosts and goblins. American Psycho is scary, half because of its sociopath protagonist and half because you actually end up cheering him on. Christian Bale is a sleek and classy yuppie businessman who’s also a murderous psychopath.
Forget Dexter Morgan — comedy doesn’t get any darker than this.
Hocus Pocus
Who doesn’t remember this childhood Disney gem? The story follows a moody teenager who accidentally resurrects three evil witch sisters who want to suck the lives out of the children of Salem.
The witches’ awkward integration into the present offers plenty of laughs, and there’s no girl who didn’t want to take home Binx, the hot (at least to our young eyes) Puritan teenager-turned-talking-cat. Nostalgia is a powerful thing, especially when it reminds us of candy and Halloween parties.
Ginger Snaps
Everyone remembers awkward teenage years. Fortunately for most of us, they did not involve disemboweling the school janitor. Early amorous encounters also weren’t likely to spread lycanthropy.
In Ginger Snaps, werewolves are thematically connected with puberty. After Ginger is savaged by a hulking beast, her sister Brigitte begins to notice some rapid changes. Suddenly, her sister is sexier and fiercer — and Brigitte can’t decide if her sister growing a tail is more terrifying than her sister losing her virginity.
Part humorous, part creepy and suitably metaphoric, Ginger Snaps spins a fascinating twist on the werewolf genre.
A Nightmare on Elm Street
Halloween might have the more appropriately holiday-themed title, but A Nightmare on Elm Street’s Freddy Krueger is still the ultimate Halloween villain. Part ghost, part serial killer and part witty conversationalist, Freddie makes killing teenagers fun. At the same time, it’s still very much a horror movie, with scenes that run from darkly funny to just gross-out disturbing. And like all great slasher films, the ending doesn’t just let the children off the hook.
This might seem unfair on any other day, but on Halloween it’s funny sadism.

Remember the hired magicians who once delighted you with their card tricks at birthday parties?
You might think you’re too old for magic tricks, but Hollywood Magic Bar, the newest party in Hollywood, is determined to enthrall you with magic again — with a grown-up twist.
If there’s ever a way to make magic tricks cool again, it’s to stage them in a happening Hollywood nightclub. Popping up at Level 3 nightclub in the Hollywood & Highland Center, Hollywood Magic Bar made its grand opening Sunday with plenty of pizzazz.
Whimsical bar · Taking over Level 3 nightclub in the Hollywood & Highland Center, the Hollywood Magic Bar stuns patrons with guest magicians and a dazzling bar that features impressive mixologists. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
Hollywood Magic Bar has all the basic elements of a posh nightclub: tons of room-shaking music courtesy of DJ Prophet, a decent dance floor, a sensuous light system and a full bar.
The main attraction is the magic, which dazzles you the moment you walk in.
At Hollywood Magic Bar, the entire nightclub is a stage. The mixology team is from Magixology, a bona fide group of bartenders who happens to have a few tricks up their sleeves. They won’t poof cocktails out of nowhere, but they will pour your drink with a bit more grace than ordinary bartenders. You can stick to your favorite drink, but expect them to somehow convince you to try their special potion of the night. On the debut night, it was a purplish-auburn concoction of vodka, black-cherry liqueur and pineapple juice on the rocks — sparkly-sweet and intoxicatingly exotic.
A shimmering lounge decked with white couches and ivory satin cushions doubles as paranormal stomping grounds for fortune-teller Shannon Leischner, who, for a tip, will read your mind and your fortune. Mirrors, mystically reflecting the violet-peach glow emanating from above, surround the room.
Even if you don’t go for the psychic, there will be no room for you to hide from the theatrics. While you lounge around and sip your cocktail, several magicians prowl, chatting you up while showing off signature skills up-close.
These performers are relentless and confident; they will charm you with their jokes and lure your interest with their mystery. No two performances are the same, but all are spectacular.
Introducing himself as a mentalist, Robert E.C. Valdemar, for example, weaves psychology and magic. He reads thoughts and explains your thought process as he guesses the card or picture you have in your mind.
Phil Van Tee, on the other hand, is as gregarious as Valdemar — soft-spoken and intense. Trained by the Ringling Brothers Circus, Phil is a stand-up comedian whose magic is creative and witty.
These magicians aren’t your 8-year-old’s birthday party entertainers who pull quarters out of your ear and flap out a few card tricks. Most of the performers on the main stage Sunday night were world-class, award-winning magicians whose phantasmagoric acts left the audience whooping and rubbing their eyes in wonder.
You can also watch Sisuephan Philia, the host and lead magician, levitate objects (and even herself) and strut out one slinky outfit after another with a zap and a poof.
Spectators will laugh out loud at Tony Clark’s raunchy, sarcastic jokes just before he pulls out storms of illusions using ropes, wands and cards.
Andrew Goldenhersh is another comedic magician, in this case one with hilarious Jewish-themed punch lines. His magic, though, is serious and elegant: A butterfly tattoo on his forearm unfolds into a real butterfly, and a Tai-chi dance-escape out of a straitjacket finishes with two giant, fluttering birds.
World-traveling magician Steve Owens, meanwhile, prefers to let his graceful, sinewy hands tell the tale as they trick a wand to twirl around the air, shimmy out a parade of cards and glitter or snap forth spontaneous, flickering flames.
Though the atmosphere is fun and wondrous, Hollywood Magic Bar lacks the most important magic of all: the “it” factor. Perhaps because it was the opening event and a Sunday night, the trickles of attendees were small and lethargic. The nightclub was entertaining and relaxing — not crazy and merry. It’s not a place to crash, get inebriated and dance away to techno music; it’s more like a wonderland into which you ride mesmerized, although instead of a mad tea party, you get razzle-dazzle performers and hard liquor.
It’s an entirely different world at Hollywood Magic Bar. The hosts claim no responsibilities for missing body parts or death by a magical tiger. They will, however, take charge of making sure you have the most magical time of your life.
The Hollywood Magic Bar is no longer taking place at Level 3 Nightclub.  This was a one time event and is not a weekly event and Level 3.  Please remove this posting.
Thanks.

It’s nearing the end of October, and for many people that means one thing: Halloween.
For others, it can mean something equally exciting: Día de los Muertos.
Día de los Muertos, “All-Souls Day” in the United States, is a Mexican holiday celebrated Nov. 2 that honors those who have passed away.
It sounds grim, but it’s actually a festive day to celebrate — rather than mourn — those who are no longer with us. Art, bread- and candy-making, costumes and elaborate make-up mark the festivities as Los Angeles gets ready to party it up in a major way.
Here are a number of activities you can take part in to celebrate Día de los Muertos.
El Velorio 
If art is your thing, then you shouldn’t miss El Velorio in Downtown Los Angeles’ KGB Gallery, an event that features food, music, drinks, face-painting and, of course, lots of art. More than 100 local artists will be crafting art, with proceeds going to fund the Buen Pastor Mural Project, which uses art to help women and children affected by domestic violence.
El Velorio will take place Friday, from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m., at the KGB Gallery on 1640 North Spring St.
Carnaval de los Muertos 
For something more ghoulish, try the Carnaval de los Muertos, or “Carnival of the Dead,” where zombies and monsters join forces to take over South Gate Park. The event will include Halloween-themed mazes, a battle of the bands, gourmet food trucks, a best-dressed zombie award, various booths, Día de los Muertos altars and more.
Carnaval de los Muertos will take place Friday, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., at South Gate Park on 4855 Tweedy Blvd.
Olvera Street
You can’t celebrate a Mexican holiday without spending some time on Los Angeles’ historic Olvera Street, the oldest street in the city and one ripe with Mexican culture. With a gallery opening at the Instituto Cultural Mexicano on Friday, a Novenario (a Catholic prayer tradition) ceremony taking place Saturday and Sunday, and community Día de los Muertos altars being displayed through Wednesday, Olvera Street will be worth a visit anytime you’re free.
Check out the festivities on Olvera Street running today through Wednesday.
Mercado La Paloma 
For something closer to home, try celebrating Día de los Muertos at Mercado La Paloma, a 10-minute walk from campus. Stop by on Sunday to see how this mega-market is transformed into a fantastic Día de los Muertos celebration with live music, art exhibitions, cultural and culinary performances and a giant altar in their outdoor gazebo. There will also be live workshops demonstrating indigenous leatherwork, traditional weaving and ceramics.
Mercado La Paloma’s celebration will take place Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., on 3655 South Grand Ave.
“La Muerte Vive” 
For something a little different, try going to the first annual “La Muerte Vive” (or “Death Lives”) cabaret show. The rock-opera cabaret will feature performances by El Gavachillo (Wil-Dog Abers of the popular Latin band Ozomatli), The Wiseguys (a British electronica/hip-hop band), the 18-piece Big Band Machine and other special guests.
Los Angeles-based artist Santos de Los Angeles scored the play’s music and plans to delve into the history of Día de los Muertos’ holiday traditions through traditional theater, spoken-word performances, music and storytelling.
“La Muerte Vive” will take place Wednesday and Saturday, from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. both days, at Million Dollar Theatre on 307 South Broadway.

The Los Angeles community’s voice has been heard. After a four-year community-led campaign, Los Angeles is removing a punitive anti-truancy policy that targets inner-city students.
The policy essentially meant any child caught violating daytime curfew laws could be fined up to $250 by the Los Angeles Police Department.
With the repeal of this law, attendance will surely be affected positively in schools. It is a victory for families and students in Los Angeles, as well as USC’s own community programs such as the Good Neighbor Campaign that reach out to surrounding middle and high schools. The Good Neighbor Campaign is a partnership between USC and local schools that raises money to support USC neighborhood outreach.
Government believes the truancy law that was previously in place would positively affect student attendance because fining students should scare them into going to school.
For various reasons, however, it seems as if the measures taken to enforce the anti-truancy policy are what scares children.
Many inner city students use public transportation, or have to accompany their siblings on the bus to different school districts.
Because of one simple variable, such as a late bus, a child might think, “I’d rather just stay home than get caught violating daytime curfew laws.” And it makes sense; $250 is a profound burden on low-income families.
Moreover, because of the old anti-truancy policy, LAPD was usually directed to handcuff and search students caught outside of school during school hours. This measure is far too aggressive for a child.
If a child knows she or he is at risk of being handcuffed while en route to school, she or he could very well be scared into staying at home to forfeit the prospect of being searched and fined.
Another victory in the repeal for the Los Angeles community is that minority students will no longer be disproportionally affected.
Eighty-eight percent of the 47,000 tickets issued between 2004 and 2009 were given to black and Latino/a students, even though they make up only 74 percent of the district’s enrollment according to Colorlines.com.
In my experience as a tutor for seven- to 14-year-old children in South Central Los Angeles, students would constantly tell me stories of the tickets they’d received while heading to school.
Subtle factors like late bus arrival take a toll on students, and the anti-truancy law was unsympathetic to these factors.
As a USC student, I can see how unfair the law is because I constantly see police cars around schools in the area. It says something that certain areas in Los Angeles are monitored more than others, especially when those focused areas have prominent black and Latino/a populations.

Police fines might seem to be a ploy by local governments to make easy money from citizens, but when it is employed with the intent to curb school truancy, it is a good strategy.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
The Los Angeles School Police Department recently announced it will follow LAPD’s lead and not ticket students enrolled in Los Angeles Unified School District schools within a designated area in the first 90 minutes of the school day. To stop ticketing as a deterrent for skipping class is a bad idea as it is a useful way to prevent truancy.
Youth advocates and opponents of the original ticketing policy argued the threat of a ticket increases truancy because it discourages students from being on time or from going to school at all. Critics, however, fail to consider the usefulness of ticketing as financial incentive to deter negative behavior and encourage good behavior. When combined with community-level initiatives, such as USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign, truancy could be eradicated.
People are less likely to do things that will cost them money. Common sense should tell children that, if their families could be charged money based on their poor behavior, they should avoid those behaviors.
Using money and threatening to take away something important to many families, ticketing gets the family involved and encourages parents to make sure their children get to school on time, if for no other reason than for avoiding a $250 charge.
That is not to say the original ticketing policy was flawless. The current fine is excessive, so it would be a good idea to decrease the fine to a level more feasible for lower-income families that would still motivate them to attend school.
USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign can use law enforcement’s attendance policy as a springboard for supplementing classroom education with the structured, positive after-school activities proven to be beneficial for children. These types of extracurricular activities can incentivize students to attend school so they can reap the benefits of fun programs offered after the school day is complete.
The ticketing measure can keep vulnerable students away from harmful behavior that often comes with truancy and a lack of education, such as violence and drug abuse.
Not only does truancy cost students in the short term, but it can have long-term societal effects as well. Success often starts at the educational level, and emphasizing the importance of education serves as an important reminder.
Even if children are too young to understand the far-reaching implications of an education, it is the responsibility of adults to ensure children have guidance in their education. By ignoring the problem at the law enforcement level, society ignores children and puts them in jeopardy of undervaluing education at a young age. This is something neither these children nor Los Angeles can afford.

On Oct. 26, a nightmare-sized version of a children’s toy washed up on a Florida beach — an 8-foot-tall Lego man named Ego Leonard, who apparently wants you to show him your world. 
On his website, translated from Dutch, reads “I am here to discover and learn about your world and thoughts. Show me all the beautiful things that are there to admire and experience in your world. Let’s become friends, share your story with me, take me with you on a journey through beautiful meadows, words, sounds and gestures.”
The site also features photo galleries of Leonard-narrated adventures with people who “befriended” the fiberglass man, as well as the mission behind Leonard’s existence. Leonard desires to be treated like a fellow being, and so wants the authenticity of quality time; hence, his ‘wearing’ a shirt reading “No Real Than You Are.”
There was speculation that Leonard is a publicity stunt put on by the recently-opened Legoland in Orlando, yet a spokeswoman quickly denied it, saying, “I wish we could say we did it, it was a brilliant guerrilla PR stunt.” Unfortunately for the creators of Ego Leonard, his journey to experience the world is on hold; the fiberglass friend is held now in custody in a Florida county jail waiting to be claimed.

USC is flying high after a monumental victory over rival Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. Things don’t get any easier for the Trojans as the undefeated Cardinal head to Los Angeles for Halloween weekend.
Led by Heisman hopeful quarterback Andrew Luck, Stanford has been nothing short of amazing so far in 2011. The Cardinal have outscored their opponents 340 to 88 so far in 2011. Its closest margin of victory so far this year is 26 against UCLA. Let’s take a closer look at some statistics that show why Stanford is ranked fourth in the AP Poll and sixth in the BCS.
The Stanford offense has put up an average of 48.6 points per game, good for second in the country. That is due in large part to the Cardinal’s 25th ranked pass offense (284.7 yards per game) as well as its 17th ranked rushing attack (219.4 rush yards per game). USC has a prolific offense of its own, but the Trojans 30.1 points per game and 145.7 rush yards per game are considerably less than Stanford’s totals.
The Cardinal also get the job done on the defensive side of the ball. Coach David Shaw has his team allowing just 12.6 points per game, good for fourth in the country.
Despite the fact that Stanford has experienced a tremendous amount of success up to this point, there is a catch. Stanford opponents are just a combined 20-30 on the year, and USC will undoubtedly be the best team the Cardinal have seen so far in 2011. Even though Stanford has looked impressive while cruising to a 7-0 record, they’ve yet to see an offense as good as the Trojans’.
Unfortunately for USC fans, the same could be said when assessing the Trojans’ previous opponents. Stanford will roll into the Coliseum hotter than ever, and none of USC’s 2011 opponents compare to what Stanford brings to the table.
Look for a high scoring affair between two of the nations top offenses. Stanford will have a little Luck on its side, and his presence alone could create nightmares for USC all Halloween weekend long.

Speculations of Apple releasing a television set were further fueled after the release of Walter Isaacson’s biography Steve Jobs on Oct. 24, which hinted that Apple was moving into the television market.
Presumably, the device will be a LCD television powered by Apple’s iOS software, capable of synching wirelessly with other Apple devices, and integrated with basic console gaming. The television industry is one that has remained untouched by the billon-dollar company.
“It will have the simplest user interface you can imagine,” Jobs told Isaacson in the biography.
According to Gene Munster, Jeff Robbin is said to be leading a team in developing a prototype of the Apple television and could possibly release the set late 2012 or early 2013. Jeff Robbin has been extremely influential and beneficial to Apple’s successful ventures. Robbin helped develop the iPod and iTunes, and even persuaded Jobs to allow iTunes to be released for Microsoft Windows.
With the recent release of iCloud, the wirelessly accessible data storage for Apple devices, and Siri, the personal voice controlled assistant application, the release of an Apple television set could not be better timed. Apple has always strived to create devices with unmatched aesthetics, convenient controls, and high quality. The integration of iCloud and Siri into the television would give Apple the advantage in the television market.

Three months after the British singer’s inconclusive passing, the official cause of Amy Winehouse’s death has finally been confirmed — “death by misadventure,” or accidental alcohol poisoning.
Tests run by pathologist Suhail Baithun and coroner Suzanne Greenway found excessive amounts of alcohol in the 27-year-old singer’s system, more than five times the legal driving limit. Additionally, the coroner discovered the drug Librium, a sedative used to lessen alcohol withdrawal symptoms, in her system, but said that it did not play a part in her death.
The numbers were revealed at the inquest hearing today at St. Pancras Coroners Court in north London.
On the night of her death at her Camden home, personal security guard Andrew Morris, last talked to the singer around 2 a.m., returning to check on a “sleeping” Amy just eight hours later. Morris became suspicious when he noticed that the Grammy award-winning artist had not moved when he checked on her again at 3 p.m. and called the police when he found she was not breathing and had no pulse.
After searching her room, authorities discovered three empty bottles of vodka — two full-sized and one smaller one.
Winehouse’s regular doctor, Christina Romete had seen her at 7 p.m. the previous day, describing her as tipsy but coherent enough to hold a conversation. Romete said that the singer had abstained from drinking alcohol for a period of three weeks and had just resumed drinking the day before her death.
Although Amy’s parents continue to grieve the loss of their daughter, family spokesman, Chris Goodman, says that they are relieved “to finally find out what happened to Amy” and are involved in a number of projects surrounding her death.
Last month, the Winehouse family founded the Amy Winehouse Foundation in an effort to raise money for individuals dealing with addiction, health, poverty and disability.
According to Goodman, the ruling “underlines how important our work with the Amy Winehouse Foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name.”
Mitch Winehouse, Amy’s father, is preparing to write and release “Amy: My Daughter,” a memoir in which he will let the public in on the Amy he knew and loved.
