No matter which college basketball powerhouses USC competes against in the non-conference portion of the schedule, the two biggest games of the season are against UCLA.
In his first three games against the crosstown rivals, Trojans coach Kevin O’Neill is undefeated.
“I guess that is important around here,” O’Neill said about beating UCLA. “It is not just another game. It is a big win for us.”
A standing-room-only student section packed the Galen Center to see USC (10-6, 2-1) earn its fourth consecutive victory against UCLA (9-6, 1-2) on Sunday, 63-52.
“[The win] means everything to us,” senior forward Alex Stepheson said. “The whole city of Los Angeles watches this game.”
Feeding off the rowdy sold-out crowd, the Trojans opened the game on a 10-4 run. However, after junior guard Jio Fontan committed a flagrant foul against UCLA forward Reeves Nelson, the Bruins went on a 5-0 run and led 30-28 by halftime.
UCLA came into the game having never lost in the eight games that they led at halftime. Unfazed, the Trojans set the tempo to begin the second half, opening on a 12-4 run and never relinquishing the lead.
“The crowd helped pick us up,” Stepheson said. “They were the sixth man, and gave us an energy boost in the second half when we needed it.”
The Trojans received dominating performances from Stepheson and junior forward Nikola Vucevic. Vucevic had a game-high 20 points. Stepheson added 13 points and 16 rebounds, including six offensive rebounds.
In the first half, senior guard Marcus Simmons was able to contain forward Tyler Honeycutt, the Bruins’ second leading scorer. It took Honeycutt over ten minutes to score his first basket, at which point Simmons was resting on the bench. Honeycutt only scored four points in the first half. With Simmons sidelined for much of the second half with foul trouble, guards Fontan, Bryce Jones and Donte Smith split time frustrating Honeycutt, who finished with 10 points and tied his season-high with seven turnovers.
While Honeycutt did not provide his standard offensive production in the first half, forward Reeves Nelson, UCLA’s leading scorer, flourished. Nelson made his first five field goal attempts, and finished the opening half with 12 points. However, USC managed to make adjustments defensively in the second half, only allowing Nelson to score two points after halftime.
Fontan had 10 points and three assists for the Trojans. Freshman guard Maurice Jones added nine points and four steals.
Despite the 11-point win, O’Neill was not entirely pleased with his team’s performance, pointing out the fact that Bruins made 57.1 percent of their shots in the first half, and the Trojans only made half of their free throw attempts.
“We know that [UCLA] will play better next time,” O’Neill said. “We will have to play better the entire game to have a chance to win.”
USC will embark on their first road trip of the Pac-10 Conference season, traveling to Eugene to play Oregon on Thursday, and then to Corvallis to take on Oregon State Saturday.

A year after Pete Carroll’s infamous decision to leave USC to take over as head coach of the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, the nine-year Trojan head coach has led his new team to the postseason for the first time since 2007, and coincidently, an opening round victory, as well.
The Seahawks, who began the game at 7-9, faced off against the defending champion New Orleans Saints, who were entering the playoffs with a slightly better 11-5 mark, harboring dreams of a possible Super Bowl repeat.
After becoming the first team to earn a postseason berth with a sub-500 record, the Seahawks were considered by many to be serious underdogs. Instead, however, Seattle notched one of the biggest upsets in NFL postseason history, defeating the visiting Saints 41-36.
Quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, whose team was faced with a 10-point deficit early in the first quarter, engineered the Seahawks’ comeback, throwing for 272 yards and four touchdowns.
The Saints, however, had little difficulty providing similar offensive fireworks. In the wake of losing running back Pierre Thomas to an ankle injury, New Orleans relied heavily on its backfield tandem of Julius Jones and former USC All-American Reggie Bush. Ironically, Jones, who finished with 120 yards rushing and two touchdowns, was cut by Seattle earlier this season. Bush was a non-factor, though, with just five carries for a total of 12 yards and did not play in the fourth quarter after heading to the locker room.
But arguably, Saints quarterback Drew Brees was the game’s biggest performer, throwing for 404 yards with two touchdowns, cutting the Seahawks lead to four at the start of the final quarter.
As the fourth quarter winded down, the Seahawks were able to run the ball, allow the the clock to run, and as a result, keep Brees on the sideline.
On a second-and-10 play, Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch scored what led to be the game winning touchdown. In the final three minutes Lynch ran for 67 yards, breaking a half-dozen tackles to give his team an 11-point lead.
Although the Saints made one last drive, scoring on a six-yard touchdown pass from Brees to wide receiver Devery Henderson, Lynch’s explosive run sealed the Seahawks’ fate. On the afternoon, Lynch finished with 131 yards on 19 carries and one touchdown, becoming the first Seahawk running back to top 100 yards all season.
Carroll and the Seahawks hope momentum will carry over to next Sunday’s NFC Divisional matchup against the NFC North champion Chicago Bears, who are led by all-pro quarterback Jay Cutler.
FIGHT ON COACH CARROLL!!!!!

Junior guard Briana Gilbreath attempted a shot and came up empty.
“She had open looks,” coach Michael Cooper said.  “She just wasn’t knocking them down. That’s going to happen in this game of basketball.”
And that pretty much summed up the rest of the game as the Women of Troy (10-4, 2-1) came up empty in their attempt to stretch their winning streak to seven games.
The No. 12 UCLA Bruins (13-1, 3-0) won in convincing fashion 61-42, using a stifling defense to limit a USC offense to just 28 percent shooting from the field.
It’s very disappointing,” junior guard Ashley Corral said.  “You always want to come to UCLA and play hard, play tough and try to get a win. They were another road block in our path to success, and today we got stopped.”
UCLA’s Jasmine Dixon finished with a game-high 20 points and nine rebounds and ultimately proved to be the difference in the game.
The Women of Troy and the Bruins exchanged baskets in the early going with four lead changes, but the Bruins went on a 18-5 run over the last 15 minutes in the first half that gave them a 26-13 advantage going into halftime.
 “I thought our defense kept us in there,” Cooper said.  “We held the 12th best team in the country to 26 points in the first half — that’s pretty good.  We just weren’t generating any offense.”
A full-court press and a zone defense stifled the Women of Troy on offense as they managed to shoot just 5-for-22 from the field in the first half.
More glaringly though, they committed 10 turnovers and gave up nine offensive rebounds. 
The second half wouldn’t prove to be much different as the Bruins opened up with a 8-2 run in the first three minutes, pushing their lead to 36-15.
For much of the rest of the game, the Women of Troy struggled to establish any type of offensive consistency and the Bruins led by as many as 25 points.
“You’re not going to win many games when you shoot just 27 percent and we’re a better shooting team than that,” Cooper said.  “For us to score 13 points in a half … I haven’t seen that all season.”
Beside their shooting woes, USC had difficulty keeping the Bruins off the offensive glass as they gave up a total of 19 offensive rebounds that led to 19 second chance points.
Gilbreath struggled from the field the entire game, misfiring on all 12 attempts. She finished with nine points – all from the free-throw line – and eight rebounds.
Corral led USC with 14 points, with 11 coming in the second half. 
The next game for the Women of Troy will be against Oregon at the Galen Center on Thursday, Jan. 13 at 7 pm.
