The friendly confines of McAlister Field proved to be the perfect ingredient for victory for the USC women’s soccer team as it came away with a weekend sweep against then-No. 25 Auburn and Northern Arizona University in the Trojan Invitational.

Looking to match their success last weekend, the Women of Troy (4-1-2) will face the Oklahoma Sooners (3-2-1) at 3 p.m. at McAlister Field — and once again, protecting home field will be of the utmost importance for the team.
“We can use our home field to our advantage,” senior forward Megan Ohai said. “We don’t want to lose at home and the more wins we get at home, the tougher it gets for other teams to come in and play.”
The team now finds itself on a six-game unbeaten streak and on the receiving end of some recognition because of its recent play. In the National Soccer Coaches Association of America and Soccer America polls, the Women of Troy are ranked No. 23.
Despite what the rankings say, senior defender Karter Haug said the Women of Troy just need to go out and play.
“We don’t really look at the rankings,” Haug said.  “It’s one of those things where we just want to come out, play our game and whoever we’re playing … we just want to do our best.”
The defense has been shutting down opponents and the offense has been creating plenty of scoring opportunities — the only problem is that the team is not finishing those opportunities.
Though the Women of Troy did score multiple goals for the first time against Northern Arizona, Ohai believes that their offense can still do better.
“We can’t take it to heart too much,” Ohai said.  “It motivates us a little bit because we’ve been working on it, but we’ve got to keep going and there’s still room for improvement.”
With some momentum going into the match against the Sooners, the Women of Troy are playing with confidence, but USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said the team shouldn’t worry about winning.
“When you just focus on results, you’re going to be an inconsistent team,” Khosroshahin said. “But when you focus on how you play, the results will take of itself if you do the little things correctly.”
If the Women of Troy do all the little things correctly and control what they can control ­— most notably, finishing their scoring opportunities and taking care of the ball — they will be in a good position to duplicate their recent success.

The Lyon Center, USC’s main gym for students, has become burdened with a growing number of broken machines — treadmills, ellipticals and StairMasters — inconveniencing gym patrons during their workouts, students said.
Break down · Visitors to the Lyon Center say about one-third of the equipment is broken, which the center attributes to an influx of students. - Hayden Bennett | Daily Trojan 
When the Daily Trojan walked through the Lyon Center earlier this week, on the first floor of the Lyon Center four of the nine treadmills and one of the three StairMasters were out of order. In addition, six out of 13 televisions attached to the ellipticals did not function properly.
On the second floor, none of the StairMasters turned on. Thirteen or more televisions on 28 ellipticals didn’t work. Four treadmills had out-of-order signs.
In all, technical problems currently affect approximately one-third of the fitness machines at the Lyon Center as of Monday. This makes it difficult to find and exercise on a fitness machine at times, students said.
“There’s more waiting time. We’re all pressed for time,” said Christine Vaughn, a senior majoring in business administration. “I feel like the machines aren’t consistently fixed. I mean, they fix some and then another set breaks down.”
Some students also said broken machines have always been a problem at the Lyon Center.
“It’s gotten a little bit worse recently, especially with the TVs being broken on the machines,” said Michelle Gossman, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “I don’t really know what they do to fix the problem, but it always seems to be a problem.”
Derek Lim, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering, said there were times when he simply couldn’t work out or had to find an alternative to the Lyon Center.
“It throws off the rhythm [of my workout],” he said.
Yet, according to Arvin Varma, assistant director of recreational sports, Lyon Center staff members say they have been responding to student complaints and problems.
“I think it’s under control,” Varma said. “You would not find more than two or three machines down.”
With a user base of more than 3,000 students, various machines do break down on a regular basis, but the staff at the Lyon Center are not always allowed to repair the machines themselves, Varma said.
“There are certain parts that we do not keep in stock, so we have to wait,” Varma said. “A lot of machines are under warranty, so we cannot touch and open them — it has to be the company.”
Varma attributed the current rise in broken machines to the return of students to campus, yet said he did not consider the broken machines to be a situation of concern.
“There will always be a few machines down at any time.  This is quite normal,” Varma said. “We didn’t have a lot of problems during the summer, but with students coming back, machines will break. But I think it’s under control.”
The Lyon Center needs to be destroyed and rebuilt, end of story.  The amount of workouts it gets per day and per month are way above what the place was built for.  Additionally, the facility hasn’t been maintained as it should.  Equipment breakdowns are common and they for some machines take months to repair.  One of the stairmasters downstairs at Lyon Center was down all of summer.  The same machines have had the same issues for months now.  
Additionally, most of the equipment in the facility looks like it at least 10 years old.  The treadmills are a hodge-podge of brands bought 1 or 2 at a time.  The outside maintenance company (Advantage Fitness Products) seems to be a joke or USC is just not reporting issues to them as they are the outside maintenance contractor.  Either USC needs a new maintenance company or the administration of the Lyon Center is inept and everyone should be fired (also, as someone who goes to the Lyon Center almost everyday I’ve only seen one person from the administration walk through the actual workout areas once, shouldn’t they be checking what is going on more regularly?)
USC should really consider outsourcing the facility to a corporate company to take over its operations such as 24 Hour Fitness or LA Fitness.  While they may not be a perfect solution, they have the resources to keep equipment up and running.
Also, who decided to buy the new monster flat/touch screens for the facility? That was the biggest waste of money.  Instead of buying new flat benches, weights, stretching equipment, or something else they wasted money on flat screens that show useless information (like the one in the downstairs weight room in the middle that replays the same information every 2 minutes).  This was a complete waste of money and squandering of resources that could have been better used elsewhere.  
Bottom line.  The school needs a new facility that matches its needs, is run in a professional manner, and has either a certified in house maintenance staff (like corporate gym’s do, it’s not hard to send a person to a 3 day training seminar so they’re certified to do warranty work (I did it for the company I’m starting)) or a dedicated outside contractor who will get equipment back and running with 24 hours (as most companies such as StarTrac dictate)).
The ones in the galen center are a lot better.  Lyon center should be destroyed.  It’s old.
For a private school USC’s gym is embarrassing. I toured many schools, and USC by far had one of the worst gyms.  The University of Arizona’s gym was absolutely gorgeous.  I think it is time for USC to build us a new gym with working equipment.  This is far one of the worst gyms I have ever been to!!

USC’s director of stem cell research Martin Pera released a statement contesting the federal ruling prohibiting the use of federal funds for stem cell research, stating that the discoveries made in the field are critical to many patients.
Pera, foundation director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, issued a statement Aug. 24 defending the need of the National Institute of Health to continue funding such research.
“This ruling will disrupt or halt important stem cell research programs, and it represents a major setback to the hopes of hundreds of thousands of patients who stand to benefit from the outcomes of this work,” the statement said.
In August, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling prohibiting the use of federal funds for stem cell research.
“This decision will not only impact ongoing studies, but will also send a very negative message to scientists, particularly young researchers, who have dedicated their careers to pursuing this promising new area of science,” the statement said.
USC’s application of stem cell research has pioneered new methods of curing a host of major diseases. In recent months, USC, along with a number of research groups and universities in the United States, has made breakthroughs.
Research at the university has led to key discoveries in how heart tissue is formed and how limb growth can be regenerated, among other developments.
Still, even among USC students, the issue remains divisive.
“On the one hand, I’m disappointed by the ruling because other nations are going ahead with stem cell research at a faster pace and it’s very possible we as a country could be left behind,” said Mark Ojo, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering. “But on the other hand I’m a Catholic and from a personal standpoint I identify with the court’s decision to show a respect for life.”
Currently research remains uninterrupted, as the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit placed a stay on the decision pending appeal. The Appeals Court will decide Sept. 20 whether or not to extend the stay or to let it expire.
The issue is not about “stem cell research”, it’s about -embryonic- stem cell research. But if my memory is correct, didn’t Obama cancel the restriction shortly after taking office in 2009? Quick reminder about the two types of stem cell research:
1. Embryonic stem cell research: requires the killing of unborn humans; has produced no cures to anything; nobody will fund it, so liberals are begging the government to do so
2. Adult stem cell research: doesn’t involve anything immoral, has been massively successful at producing cures to important diseases, and every biotech investor worth his salt is willing to invest in it.

The Row, which has not held social activities since Aug. 31, will once again be allowed to host parties starting today.
Party on · Greek members on The Row can now participate in social activities, after the ban was lifted today. A majority of the houses on The Row were sanctioned after unauthorized parties on Aug. 30, when eight students were taken to the hospital. - Chloe Stepney | Daily Trojan 
Sixteen Interfraternity Council chapters were cited for unauthorized parties on Aug. 30, when eight students were taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. All IFC fraternities were placed on social probation until further actions were taken.
IFC held a meeting at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity Tuesday to discuss The Row’s indefinite ban. All 23 fraternity presidents, the risk managers from every fraternity, Department of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton and Panhellenic President Laura Redfern attended the meeting, among others.
At the end of the meeting, Assistant Director for the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Ray Carlos announced that the ban would end today.
According to IFC President Eric Ronan, the ban would not officially end until all 16 houses met with the Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards committee. The last fraternity met with SJACS on Thursday.
At the meeting, Drayton answered questions and gave advice on how to avoid the issues that led to the ban.
“The meeting [on Tuesday] went extremely well,” Ronan said. “Chief Drayton offered us some advice for moving forward and how to have safer parties in the future that meet the expectations of DPS.”
Drayton also took the meeting as an opportunity to explain the importance of a working relationship between the fraternities and DPS, according to Parker Adams, IFC’s vice president for public relations.
“DPS is not our enemy. They want us to have fun,” Adams said. “[DPS is] overwhelmed on a nightly basis just trying to keep us safe from the hood and from ourselves. They ask that we help them help us.”
All of the fraternities have agreed to keep all red cups and alcoholic beverages inside the house, not have large groups of people congregate outside the house and not let loud music disturb the surrounding neighborhood.
All of those rules were violated Aug. 30, Ronan said.
“It was obvious the 16 houses were having parties that were out of control,” he said.
Adams said he thinks Greek members have learned their lesson and are ready to host parties in a more responsible way.
“I feel that Monday was more of an enigma,” Adams said. “I just see us going back to how we usually party: smartly.”
The fraternities are not the only organizations trying to ensure the safety of USC students. Panhellenic is also taking steps to avoid nights similar to the one that many have dubbed “Black Monday,” Redfern said.
Redfern brought to the meeting a letter signed by all of the sorority presidents that detailed effective risk management procedures, which sororities should enact to dissuade irresponsible drinking.
“It is every member’s responsibility to not put pressure on the new members to drink to have a good time,” Redfern said. “[PHC is] encouraging frats that it’s okay to turn away a girl who is too drunk.”
Redfern said Friday will not be a repeat of Aug. 30.
“On that Monday there was a huge number of brand new Greek members on The Row who were not accustomed to the culture here,” Redfern said. “The difference between that Monday and this Friday is that there has been discussion about responsibility on the Greek Row.”
Redfern, Adams and Ronan all agreed The Row is ready to open and that USC students will act responsibly.
“New members feel that there really is a spotlight on them now to show that they are responsible members of the Greek community, and I think they are starting to get that [The Row is] not a place to black out,” Redfern said.
I love freshman girls!  So f-ing stupid!
Please, Apollo. Your stereotypical critique of The Row and its social atmosphere just proves that you’re not affiliated with any greek organization. Take your bitterness for being a pariah elsewhere…
lol. I was an active member for over a year. I saw similar patterns in almost all the fraternities. Making girls drink until they can’t say no seems to be the prevalent strategy. You want to know how stereotypes start in the first place? Stereotypes are derived from some inkling of truth. All my experience was first hand, try your dismissive debate techniques elsewhere.
Oh, additionally I congratulate you for finding the synonym feature of internet explorer, good job little buddy!
The row is a disgrace. Nothing like underage drinking, rape and humiliation. It’s pathetic.
“[DPS is] overwhelmed on a nightly basis just trying to keep us safe from the hood and from ourselves. They ask that we help them help us.”
Safe from the hood? Or are they keeping the hood safe from your (messy, come the weekend) selves?
“enigma?”

USC Transportation has received the 2011 Innovative Transportation Solutions Award from the Los Angeles Chapter of Women in Transportation for its network of transportation services around campus.
USC was nominated for the award because of its development in large fleet management, the number of trams, a reduced carbon footprint from using biodiesel buses, and alternative ways to get to campus. USC Viterbi School of Engineering professor and WTS Director at Large James E. Moore recommended USC for the award.
The award, which highlights interesting and unique innovations, has generally been given to infrastructure developments, such as the Alameda Corridor, rather than to developments in management, Moore said.
WTS-LA usually considers five to 10 developments for the award each year.
“The closer I looked at what USC is doing, the more impressed I became,” Moore said. “Compared to other universities, USC Transportation services have been genuine leaders in terms of finding useful ways to improve their system. They are very entrepreneurial, and the array of services reflects that.”
Moore nominated USC Transportation in July after having read an article in the spring issue of Trojan Family Magazine which highlighted some of these changes.
“I didn’t realize the full scope of what transportation services was doing. This actually exceeds, in terms of scope, what many communities are doing,” Moore said. “WTS generally allocates awards like these for the public sector, and it is unusual to give them to those in the private sector.”
In the past 18 months, USC Transportation has added or expanded several programs, including the ZipCar program, which allows cars to be rented hourly, and Zimride, a social website for carpooling. Zimride has an area exclusively for USC students, staff and faculty.
USC Transportation has also purchased 11 propane buses and one natural gas bus to double the size of the fleet and reduce USC’s carbon footprint. It also added shuttle routes between campus and LA Live last November.
The Campus Cruiser service is being used more frequently as well, said Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation.
“We went from 500 calls on a busy evening to over 1,000 on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday,” Mazza said.
With 123 students taking calls and driving, Campus Cruiser is the largest student-run university program of its kind in the country, he said.
The alternative transportation appeals to students such as Matthew Palmer, a senior majoring in economics.
“For me the trams are convenient because I live by 27th [Street] and both of my bikes have been stolen,” Palmer said. “A lot of the buses run similar routes, so it’s OK if you miss one.”
Mazza said that receiving the award highlights some of the things that he and his staff have been doing, and that it was “really special” to be nominated by Moore because of his transportation expertise.
“The public recognition this award gives us is really great for my team and for the hard work that they do,” Mazza said.
WTS gives graduate and undergraduate scholarships to women pursuing jobs in transportation, science and engineering, and serves as an organization for professional networking for those in the transportation industry.
“WTS has historically been a friend to USC,” Moore said. “WTS and USC are close to each other since we’re both in the Downtown area, and WTS has been very, very generous to USC students over the years.”
A glaring hole in USC’s transportation policy is the fact that the bicycle isn’t considered part of “alternative transportation.”  A large group of students that lives outside the University Park bubble can and do ride to campus on a regular basis.  When they get there, they are treated like crap by DPS officers who see everyone as  if they were on a beach cruiser.
No secure parking for people with real bikes.  No effort to integrate off-campus bike facilities with on-campus routes.  The Hoover, McClintock, and (soon to open) Exposition bike lanes dead-end on campus.  Many USC staff (food service, janitorial, etc.) ride from the surrounding neighborhood to campus jobs.  USC Transportation does absolutely nothing to accommodate them, or even acknowledge them.
WTS would do well to look at Bicycle-Friendly Stanford (gold level), Davis (platinum level), and even our crosstown rivals UCLA for what truly green transportation looks like.
Are you kidding me? I hate to bash our fair campus, but USC has some of the worst bicycle policies imaginable, and sub-par bicycle infrastructure, despite bicycle trips amounting to somewhere near half of all trips made through the campus.  And why is James Moore, who opposed the Expo Line, in charge of giving out this award?
Also, just putting this out there, if SC really wanted to cut emissions, then they would cut back on buses and install some sort of fixed-rail streetcar or circulator powered by emissions-free overhead electric wire. There would be plenty of room to run something like that on Trousdale and University, through the neighborhood and back. Maybe even through the Row =)

The No. 7 USC women’s volleyball team is preparing for another busy weekend, with three matches in a span of only two days.
The team will participate in the Fresno State Invitational, where it will face host Fresno State on Friday at 7 p.m., followed by Cal State Bakersfield and Sacramento State on Saturday at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. respectively.
History is on the Women of Troy’s side this weekend; they have won all seven matches they have played against Fresno State. Although USC has never faced Cal State Bakersfield or Sacramento State, none of these teams have gotten off to a strong start, with Fresno State at 3-5, Sacramento State at 5-6 and Cal State Bakersfield at 0-11.
“We’ve gotten tapes of all the opponents, so we know pretty much what they’ve been trying to do, but we’re trying to improve some things that we’re doing on our side of the net,” USC coach Mick Haley said.
On paper, the Women of Troy should not have to worry about facing these opponents, considering their undefeated record and impressive wins against teams such as Hawai’i; however, Haley wants to make sure that his players stay focused rather than overlook these teams.
“Every one of them does something well and our goal is to see if we can stop what they’re trying to do, so it’s a good challenge for us,” Haley said.
Haley does seem concerned about fatigue. The Women of Troy will play four matches in five days, with a Tuesday night game on the road at UC Irvine following this weekend’s play. However, there is a reason for the madness.
“I felt like we were going to have so many good players that I needed the opportunities for everybody to get a chance to contribute and show what they can do,” Haley said. “Hopefully they’ll be mature enough to handle all the play and not as much practice.”
Haley’s confidence can be attributed to his team’s impressive depth. So far, a number of different players have had the opportunity to shine this season and Haley does not foresee this trend ending anytime soon.
Another one of his six freshmen phenoms has grabbed his attention this week — outside hitter/opposite Sara Shaw
“Sara Shaw has really kicked it up another notch,” Haley said. “She’s starting to break the heat now, and she’s capable of doing that.”
Although the Women of Troy have experienced success so far this season, in Haley’s eyes, there is still room for improvement.
“Besides trying to win the matches, we’re really trying to see if we can adjust … make adjustments, change personnel and attack what the other team’s trying to do,” Haley said.
Thus far, he seems optimistic about the team’s progress.
“We’ve done a lot of heavy work in the weight room, and we’ve done a lot of things to improve our side of the net this week,” Haley said. “So we’re hoping that we’re going to get better.”

Sometimes, fans assume that sports are like algebra.
If Team A beats Team B by 21, and if Team B beats Team C by 14, then it follows that Team A should beat Team C by 35.
Right?
No — at least, not according to Lane Kiffin and the Trojans.
Kiffin dismissed any thought of that this week, when reporters brought up the fact that Minnesota — the Trojans’ opponent Saturday — just lost to South Dakota, 41-38.
Yes, that South Dakota, a Football Championship Subdivision team that, on its official site, features a poll that about 90 percent of voters have said yes to: “Was USD football’s 41-38 win over Minnesota the biggest win in program history?”
On that note, it’s safe to say that Minnesota has had a bad week.
But that doesn’t mean that the Trojans can overlook the Golden Gophers, because, well, you saw what happened when they played a lesser-hyped team in Virginia.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, one of five captains on the 2010 squad and maybe the most outspoken player on the team, agrees with that sentiment.
“You can’t really approach games differently, I don’t think,” Barkley said this week. “Or grade them based on who you’re playing, because anything can happen. So we’re approaching it just like any other week with our same preparation. We’re not thinking this is gonna be a cakewalk, but going at it full and trying to do our best – like we always do.”
The word “cakewalk” is particularly interesting. In most situations, games such as the USC-Minnesota game and the USC-Virginia game and the USC-Hawai’i game are expected to be just that — cakewalks.
Except the first two weren’t, for a variety of reasons. And now the Trojans are trying to combat those same reasons that prevented them from strutting their stuff against the Warriors and Cavaliers.
Judging from this week of practice, that seemed like a very viable possibility, with the team looking supremely sharp and focused and on a mission.
And then Thursday’s practice happened.
Three interceptions happened. A focus- and intensity-free two hours happened.
And now we’re back to last week again, aren’t we?
“I thought it started really well,” Kiffin said of the Trojans’ game-week preparation for Minnesota following a 17-14 win over Virginia, which he called the most disappointing victory of his coaching career. “Tuesday and Wednesday were very good for the most part. [Thursday] was just OK. We’ve got a long ways to go. They need to understand that this is a very serious game and not take this opponent lightly just because of what happened last week, which doesn’t mean anything [next Saturday].”
He has a point. There are many instances of teams playing significantly worse against teams that are worse than them, and significantly better against teams that are better than them — in other words, taking them lightly.
Coaches will tell you that it’s because of a bad matchup, an injury to a specific player or guys not executing.
In reality, however, it’s just the players being humans and not getting as amped up for a lesser opponent as they would for a big-time opponent.
It only makes sense, right?
How else do you explain the Los Angeles Lakers splitting two games and being outscored by 13 points in the season series with the Charlotte Bobcats last season, then going on to win the league title for the second-straight year?
How else do you explain USC losing to lowly Stanford at the Coliseum on that fateful day in October 2007 when the Trojans hadn’t lost at home in 35 games?
The only connecting factor between those games is an obvious amount of decreased intensity from the players on the losing team.
I imagine we’ll know fairly soon on Saturday afternoon whether the Trojans have found that lost intensity, located that displaced focus and prepared properly to face the Gophers in a nationally televised game that will determine a lot of what people will say about USC football over the next several weeks.
But we don’t know yet. In Kiffin’s words, they still have ”a long ways to go.”
Maybe that involves figuring out their math, after all.

The faces might be different, but the results remain the same for the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team.
Triple threat · Junior driver Peter Kurzeka, who had a hat trick last weekend against LMU, will help USC try to keep its winning streak alive. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
After opening the season with four consecutive wins, the Trojans (4-0) will head north to Berkeley, Calif., to take part in the highly competitive NorCal Tournament and prove that their strong start is more than just an aberration.
The challenge will be stiff, as the young Trojan squad will be forced to contend with an unfamiliar Navy team in the opening game of the weekend slate.
“They’re crafty,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “They do a lot of things that are different than teams out here. They have some different defensive schemes, and because we don’t see them as much, it could create problems.”
Beyond their initial matchup with the Midshipmen, the Trojans could also face highly ranked Mountain Pacific Sports Federation foes such as UC Irvine in the quarterfinals and California in the semifinals; yet overall, they remain unfazed.
“Our goal is to win the tournament and show the country we’re still the team to beat,” said sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal.
A search for the reasons behind the team’s confidence shouldn’t take long.
Thus far, eight players have tallied at least five goals each, including freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie, who leads the team with nine scores on the year.
“He knows how to establish position in two-meter,” Vavic said. “He always looks for the ball and we’ve been able to get it to him. He’s been very effective so far.”
In his usual fashion, Vavic was also quick to point out the team’s offensive balance, as opposed to singling out individual players.
“We have a bunch of other guys who scored seven goals,” Vavic said. “That’s very close, especially this early in the season. Nine goals. Seven goals. There’s not much of a difference. Overall, we really have a good scoring team.”
What might surprise most, however, is that the Trojans are getting much of their offensive output from players with little to no collegiate experience.
Two out of their top-five leading scorers are freshmen: Vavic’s son, freshman driver Nikola, and Davie. Sophomore utility Mace Rapsey, one of four in second on the team with seven goals, is logging significant minutes for the first time in his career.
“We really don’t have any true superstars on our team,” Rosenthal said. “Instead, we have a balanced group, and [we] definitely use it to our advantage. We have many different ways we can attack and beat the opponent.”
Still, doing so won’t be easy. Fifteen teams ranked in the top 20 will take part in the same tournament that the Trojans finished third in last season.
“We haven’t really played very many of the top teams in the country yet,” Rosenthal said. “We have our first big test this weekend against Cal. We’ll see where we are after that.”

After two weeks, the jury is still out and the question remains:
Which USC team will show up Saturday in Minnesota?
Podcast: The Daily Trojan's sports editors discuss Saturday's game versus the Golden Gophers.
Armed · Sophomore qurterback Matt Barkley has seven touchdown passes through two games this season, almost half of the total he threw in 2009. He leads the Trojans against Minnesota on Saturday looking to go undefeated in non-conference games. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily TrojanAfter two uneven performances on both sides of the ball, the No. 18 Trojans (2-0) hope to see the explosive offense they showcased against Hawai’i and the stingy defense seen last week against Virginia in the 12:30 p.m. game.
The Golden Gophers (1-1) have some questions to answer themselves, coming off a 41-38 loss to FCS opponent South Dakota. Minnesota coach Tim Brewster emphasized his team needed to move on and focus on the visiting Trojans.
“It’s a big, physical, athletic football team,” Brewster said on Minnesota’s website. “They’ve got five-star football players across the board on their football team. A great deal of talent.”
The Golden Gophers are led by the nation’s sixth-leading rusher in running back Duane Bennett, who has racked up 291 yards and two touchdowns on 48 carries.
Minnesota quarterback Adam Weber, in his fourth year starting under center, has completed almost 65 percent of his passes and thrown three touchdowns.
“They’re playing really well on offense,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “They’re running the ball extremely well, the tailback’s got a ton of yards [and] the quarterback’s rating is great.”
Minnesota does not have as much going on defense (see the 41 points let up by South Dakota). Its defense returns only two starters from last year’s 6-7 squad.
That could open the door for USC’s offense to have a more Hawai’i-type performance. If so, it will start with the running game. Redshirt junior running back Marc Tyler still leads the Pac-10 in rushing with 221 yards and is looking to bounce back after only 67 yards last week.
More action is also expected from freshman running back Dillon Baxter, who made his debut against Virginia, carrying the ball nine times for 49 yards. It will be Baxter’s first road game after missing the Hawai’i game for violating team rules.
“It should be a challenge,” Baxter said. “I guess people have been saying away games are pretty loud so we’ll see what happens.”
USC’s offense also will need more stellar play from sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley.
Despite throwing five touchdowns against Hawai’i, last week might have been Barkley’s more impressive performance considering how often he was forced to elude Virginia’s rush and throw on the run.
The one unquestioned constant from USC’s first two games has been penalties. The Trojans lead the nation in the category, with 24 penalties for 240 yards.
Kiffin said he would not discuss the issue with the media this week in hopes of taking pressure off his players.
Injuries, especially on defense, will also be a concern as the Trojans struggle to stay fresh late into the game.
Redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Nick Perry and junior defensive lineman Armond Armstead were limited in practice this week, and it will be a game-time decision as to whether the two play Saturday.
Although the trip to Minnesota marks the Trojans’ second road trip of the year, this weekend marks the last one of this length.
“This is two long trips in a row,” Kiffin said. “It’s good that we’ve done it before and it’s good that we’ve knocked the two long ones out right away.”
The Trojans departed for Minneapolis Thursday after practice. USC has not faced Minnesota since 1980 but has won its last 10 straight contests against Big Ten opponents.

Well, I guess we now know what would happen if Diablo Cody took a Tony Montana-sized bump of coke, went on a weeklong VH1’s I Love The …s bender and then sat down and wrote a screenplay. Yup, she’d write Easy A.
Parental authority · Olive’s father, played by Stanley Tucci, talks about the schoolwide rumors with his daughter Olive (Emma Stone). - Photo courtesy of Screen Gems 
For sure, Easy A is Juno 2.0 — a smart, gimmicky high school romp with a charismatic, too-smart-for-her-own-good female lead and enough pop culture references to make Bill Simmons’ head spin. Only, it pushes the envelope farther than Juno ever dared. This isn’t a world of silly catchphrases (“Honest to blog,” anyone?) and unexpected teenage pregnancy. It’s a world where a teenage girl has the presence of mind to call someone “Kinsey-six gay” and pretends to prostitute herself in order to become a social pariah.
That isn’t to say that Easy A is bad. It’s not. It’s brilliant. But let’s pause for a moment. I’ve arrived at the point where I describe the premise.
Emma Stone is Olive Penderghast, an intelligent, all-but-ignored girl attending East Ojai High School. After a fictional story leaks about her having lost her virginity to a college boy, she becomes noticed for the first time. Sure, she’s a pariah (since when does having sex in high school make you a pariah?), but Olive likes the attention and embraces it.
Quickly, she learns that there is almost as much a demand for fictional sex as real sex, as male after male approaches her, willing to exchange gift cards (go with it) for the right to say they had sex with her.
Unfortunately for Olive, East Ojai High’s morals are still stuck in the 1950s, and being the school skank is a bad thing. Thrust into to public eye, she becomes an even bigger outcast than she originally was as the school’s right-wing religious group, led by Marianne (played by a delightfully evil Amanda Bynes), persecutes her Scarlet Letter style.
As absurd as the plot is, the plot isn’t the point. Stone is the point. She makes the film and is a delight to watch. She’s pretty. She’s funny. She’s glib. And she’s vulnerable. She’s the high schooler we all wanted to be but couldn’t, and you can’t help but fall in love with Olive — at least just a little bit.
It’s always interesting to see a star break out for the first time. It seems to be sudden and spectacular — seemingly out of nowhere. Of course it isn’t, but that’s how it appears to us. Stone is different. We know her. She’s been dancing around this role for years. Superbad. Zombieland. Beneath our very noses she’s been developing this glib, sassy, yet oh-so-frank Juno-like character who we always assumed would be trapped in the background.
To be honest, I never thought she’d actually do it. I remember seeing The House Bunny (don’t ask why) and walking away thinking that she had no shot to be a lead. She was too demure, fading next to the dim comedic light that is Anna Ferris. Not a good sign.
In Easy A, however, she steps up and does one of the hardest things for a comedic actor to do — carry a film while allowing others to shine. Too often we see comedies dominated by big-name stars whose noise drowns out the rest of the cast. Not here. Stone knows when to step up and take over (she saves the third act) and when to let others shine.
It’s a good thing too. The rest of the cast is brilliant, especially Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olive’s parents. Put them in the pantheon of awesome high school parents. They’re wise. They’re funny. They’re what I’d call “mentally eclectic.” Trust me — see the film, and you’ll understand.
Easy A is the kind of film that I’m sure other critics will describe as smart and sassy, but for me it’s not. It’s certainly sassy, but that’s no great feat. And the plot is too ridiculous for me to take seriously. Easy A is remarkable because it gives us the all-too-rare opportunity to see an actress spread her wings and fly. Stone will be a star. Make no mistake about that.

When I think lobster, my mind jumps to its crustacean cousin, the shrimp. And when I think shrimp I dutifully think Forrest Gump — Bubba in particular, and the multitudinous ways the man knew how to cook a shrimp.
Then I get hungry, raid my pantry and eat the closest thing I have to shrimp, which is often canned tuna.
But that’s just me.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan

The usual image that comes to mind is steamed lobster by the bucket, melted butter and small-town New England, where the world’s finest shellfish are fished. Although the perks of living in Los Angeles are plentiful, authentic Maine lobster is unfortunately not one of them, meaning Angelenos are resigned to accept a meek substitute in Pacific lobster. Ask any seafood enthusiast and they’ll tell you Maine lobster is the cat’s pajamas.
The sad reality is that Los Angeles is geographically cut-off from the premium lobster catch for most of the year. But fear not, for this weekend, deprived Southern Californians can feast on New England’s finest.
For the 11th consecutive year the Port of Los Angeles will play host to the Port of Los Angeles Lobster Festival, a three-day food and music extravaganza celebrating Maine’s tastiest treat. The festival begins today and runs through Sunday.
If binging on lobster tail is something you’re into, this is the festival for you. This weekend, more than 16 tons of fresh lobster will be flown directly from the rocky shores of the Gulf of Maine. A mere$18 gets you 1.25 pounds of succulent whole lobster plus cole slaw, potatoes, sweet bread and (naturally) sauce for dipping.
If that’s somehow not enough, there is always the option to double up with the “2 on a Plate Special,” which gives you a hulking two plates of 1.5 pounds of steamed deliciousness. If lobster isn’t your thing, you’re not out of luck. There are plenty of other seafood options, including steamed and fried clams and shrimp dishes galore as well meat alternatives.
A smorgasbord of chicken, steak, tri-tip and ribs prepared in Jamaican, Chinese and Thai traditions will be readily available as well as carnival staples like funnel cake and roasted corn. Feasting is family style and large eating tents will accommodate everyone.
The food, however, is not Lobster Fest’s only draw. After you awake from a lobster-induced food coma there is plenty more to enjoy. Though the carnival will have the obligatory street vendors and men on stilts, this is not the average hokey food fest.
Will there be lobster-themed tchotchkes? Yes. Is that all there is left to see? No.
This year’s music lineup is sponsored by L.A. radio juggernaut KROQ and its Locals Only show, which seeks to promote local independent bands that would normally not get significant airplay on commercial radio stations. As a result, the bill is an expansively eclectic mix of up-and-coming indie acts. These are no hack-jobs either. A young Jason Mraz played the first Lobster Fest and this year’s Friday night headliner will be Saint Motel, a newcomer that has made quite the splash on the Los Angeles music scene.
Heralded for its energy and showmanship, the members of Saint Motel met in film school and have been making great hard-pop ever since. The four-piece’s history is important as there is a palpable cinematic quality that beats true in its music. Whether it’s marrying filmed images to up-tempo stage performances, or the theatricality of songs like “Butch” and “Dear Dictator,” Saint Motel has made a name for itself as one of the most refreshingly inventive bands on the indie scene today. They will hit the Lobster Fest stage tonight at 9 p.m.
The lineup for tonight might be the strongest of the three days (with Spider Problem, Venus Infers and Saint Motel), but Saturday and Sunday have the best blend of sound and styles.
Saturday’s headliner Dengue Fever is perhaps the most intriguing of all the acts, as lead singer Chhom Nimol’s vocals are almost entirely in her native Cambodian. Three acts to keep an eye on are Fitz and The Tantrums (playing Saturday at 8 p.m.), Awolnation (Saturday, 5 p.m.) and Devon Eisenbarger (Sunday, 12:30 p.m.).
Fitz and The Tantrums fuse new wave and soul with retro-inspired instrumentals, creating a new sound that’s oddly familiar and annoyingly catchy. Awolnation is a must for any science-fiction fiend — its aggressive punk-electro vibe and new album Back From Earth are inspired by the space exploration fiction of the 1950s. In addition, Devon Eisenbarger is touted as the festival’s rising star. Her sound is bluesy, and the 18-year-old recently studied music at USC.
Another draw of Lobster Fest is the pirates and sea-ladies. Yes, pirates. Their mission, according to the website, is to find the captain’s treasure. A little confused, I asked the festival’s producer Jim Hall: Why pirates?
He said that everyone loves pirates, especially the kids,
“There is that special moment when you’re a young kid and you get up close to something you only imagined,” Hall said. “It becomes that one thing that you remember for the rest of your life.”
The pirates are just another part of Lobster Fest’s eccentric charm. Last year Lobster Festival set a Guinness World Record for the most seafood served at an outdoor event. Paying only $18 for a lobster dinner is a great deal in itself, and with top-notch contemporary musical acts, old-fashioned carnival fun, and pirates, this year’s Lobster Fest should be a fairground experience like no other.

If binging on lobster tail is something you’re into, this is the festival for you. This weekend, more than 16 tons of fresh lobster will be flown directly from the rocky shores of the Gulf of Maine. A mere$18 gets you 1.25 pounds of succulent whole lobster plus cole slaw, potatoes, sweet bread and (naturally) sauce for dipping.
If that’s somehow not enough, there is always the option to double up with the “2 on a Plate Special,” which gives you a hulking two plates of 1.5 pounds of steamed deliciousness. If lobster isn’t your thing, you’re not out of luck. There are plenty of other seafood options, including steamed and fried clams and shrimp dishes galore as well meat alternatives.
A smorgasbord of chicken, steak, tri-tip and ribs prepared in Jamaican, Chinese and Thai traditions will be readily available as well as carnival staples like funnel cake and roasted corn. Feasting is family style and large eating tents will accommodate everyone.
The food, however, is not Lobster Fest’s only draw. After you awake from a lobster-induced food coma there is plenty more to enjoy. Though the carnival will have the obligatory street vendors and men on stilts, this is not the average hokey food fest.
Will there be lobster-themed tchotchkes? Yes. Is that all there is left to see? No.
This year’s music lineup is sponsored by L.A. radio juggernaut KROQ and its Locals Only show, which seeks to promote local independent bands that would normally not get significant airplay on commercial radio stations. As a result, the bill is an expansively eclectic mix of up-and-coming indie acts. These are no hack-jobs either. A young Jason Mraz played the first Lobster Fest and this year’s Friday night headliner will be Saint Motel, a newcomer that has made quite the splash on the Los Angeles music scene.
Heralded for its energy and showmanship, the members of Saint Motel met in film school and have been making great hard-pop ever since. The four-piece’s history is important as there is a palpable cinematic quality that beats true in its music. Whether it’s marrying filmed images to up-tempo stage performances, or the theatricality of songs like “Butch” and “Dear Dictator,” Saint Motel has made a name for itself as one of the most refreshingly inventive bands on the indie scene today. They will hit the Lobster Fest stage tonight at 9 p.m.
The lineup for tonight might be the strongest of the three days (with Spider Problem, Venus Infers and Saint Motel), but Saturday and Sunday have the best blend of sound and styles.
Saturday’s headliner Dengue Fever is perhaps the most intriguing of all the acts, as lead singer Chhom Nimol’s vocals are almost entirely in her native Cambodian. Three acts to keep an eye on are Fitz and The Tantrums (playing Saturday at 8 p.m.), Awolnation (Saturday, 5 p.m.) and Devon Eisenbarger (Sunday, 12:30 p.m.).
Fitz and The Tantrums fuse new wave and soul with retro-inspired instrumentals, creating a new sound that’s oddly familiar and annoyingly catchy. Awolnation is a must for any science-fiction fiend — its aggressive punk-electro vibe and new album Back From Earth are inspired by the space exploration fiction of the 1950s. In addition, Devon Eisenbarger is touted as the festival’s rising star. Her sound is bluesy, and the 18-year-old recently studied music at USC.
Another draw of Lobster Fest is the pirates and sea-ladies. Yes, pirates. Their mission, according to the website, is to find the captain’s treasure. A little confused, I asked the festival’s producer Jim Hall: Why pirates?
He said that everyone loves pirates, especially the kids,
“There is that special moment when you’re a young kid and you get up close to something you only imagined,” Hall said. “It becomes that one thing that you remember for the rest of your life.”
The pirates are just another part of Lobster Fest’s eccentric charm. Last year Lobster Festival set a Guinness World Record for the most seafood served at an outdoor event. Paying only $18 for a lobster dinner is a great deal in itself, and with top-notch contemporary musical acts, old-fashioned carnival fun, and pirates, this year’s Lobster Fest should be a fairground experience like no other.
saint motel is the bestttttt

In July, monsoon rains in Pakistan resulted in devastating flooding. More than 20 million people have been affected — more than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and recent Haiti earthquake combined — with 2,000 deaths and millions more with damaged or destroyed homes. And yet, the Pakistani floods have received little media attention compared with these other events.
“People are disastered out,” comedian Max Amini said Wednesday night. He was part of Stand Up For Pakistan, a comedy benefit at the Laugh Factory designed to raise funds and awareness for the floods in Pakistan.
And he has a point. From the Haiti earthquake in January to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill this spring, the news has been filled with images of devastated areas and displaced people.
Laugh Factory Director of Marketing Zainulabedin Shah, USC alumnus from the class of 2009, agreed with Amini.
“People are fatigued from donating,” he said. “[The floods] are not getting enough media attention.”
Shah, who lived in Pakistan from ages 12 to 19 and whose parents still reside there, was inspired to organize Stand Up for Pakistan to bring awareness to a disaster that few Americans even know happened.
“What better way to bring people together than laughter?” he asked.
Shah was also the one to reach out to Relief International, the organization that received 100 percent of the Laugh Factory’s ticket sales Wednesday for its relief efforts in Pakistan. Relief International is a non-profit humanitarian organization that focuses on emergency response and long-term aid in developing countries. They have been in Pakistan since the 2005 earthquakes, and say the flooding is one of the biggest challenges they have faced.
Fortunately, the Laugh Factory was packed Wednesday and the lineup of standup comedians played to an enthusiastic, sold-out house. The large turnout proved that the issue of the Pakistani floods was important.
Amini, who hosted the event, said he is “very passionate about Pakistan” and was “honored to be picked for this event.”
“This isn’t about us performing,” he said, stressing the need to build awareness about the floods.
“United we stand is the idea,” Shah said. He crafted the lineup of comedians to cater to everybody. Maz Jobrani, who started the Axis of Evil comedy show, headlined, with Kumail Nanjiani, Ian Edwards and Chris D’Elia performing as well.
Jobrani brought a more political edge to his set. He commented humorously on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s absurd claim that there are no gay people in Iran and he satirized the stance of Al Qaeda after the failed Times Square car bombing.
Some of the hardest-hitting and funniest jokes came from Nanjiani, who spoke about the racism and cultural ignorance he faces as a Pakistani. For instance, within minutes of arriving in Irvine, Calif. for a show, he was offensively referred to as Kumar of the Harold & Kumar movies — one of the few images of a Middle Eastern person present in popular culture. Nanjiani also referenced the popular video game Call of Duty, which now takes place in the Middle East.
His hometown of Karachi had been turned into a battlefield in the game, and all of the street signs were in Arabic, even though Urdu is the language of Pakistan. Nanjiani joked about the ridiculous attention to aesthetic detail in the rest of the game that took years to design, saying “all they had to do was Google ‘Pakistan language.’”
There was an amazing energy in the Laugh Factory all night, as well as a sense of community. A couple in the audience received attention from all three Middle Eastern comics — the man was Indian and the woman Pakistani. After making them the butt of many jokes, each comedian genuinely applauded the couple’s ability to overcome its cultural differences and the history of conflict between each individual’s countries.
It was a show to remind people of the power of comedy on many levels. Hundreds of people turned out in support of the event, to raise money and awareness for the Pakistani floods.
But the culturally relevant standup also demonstrated the ability of comedy to both make light of and reveal major problems present in our society.
“One of the greatest ways to learn about culture is through comedy,” Amani said.
Stand Up for Pakistan proved how important and effective that can be.

Fear is a primal instinct we experience every day — from the stress of asking someone out to the anxiety of graduating and having to survive on our own.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
I recently tried to make a list of the things I fear most. I swallowed my stereotypical self-conceptions about laughing in the face of danger and begrudgingly spit out everything I could think of. The fears that surfaced carried some revelations that I believe a lot of college students struggle to face.
First and foremost is the obvious fear of rejection. The collegiate environment is designed to encourage and nurture new experiences; meeting new people and experimenting with new courses, clubs and organizations.
So why, with all this encouragement, does it feel so unnerving to take a risk? The weight we place on the word “no” causes us to internally exaggerate how one experience or one event defines us — and that’s intimidating. But that “no” might lead to something else even more exciting — it might force us to explore alternative prospects, or give us the opportunity to participate in something we otherwise thought impossible. It’s almost as if we get the chance to “fail forward.”
We also experience a nagging trepidation when it comes to exams. Emotions run high as we entertain such thoughts as, “I’ll ruin my GPA,” “I’ll disappoint my parents,” or “I’ll risk my place on the team.” These types of thoughts are most often disempowering. The trick is to harness this anxiety and turn thoughts of how you might fail an exam into thoughts on how to pass it. Just as easily as that fear can lead you down the path of panic, it can also help you focus on the formula for success: preparing, studying with a classmate and asking questions when you need to. Unchecked fear wastes time, plain and simple.
And of course there’s the one looming event that every college student dreads, the veritable culmination of all of our fears: graduation. Where will we go? Who will hire us? Why didn’t we work harder our freshman year? Seriously, who will hire us? Eventually we all have to grow up and leave the seemingly utopian society of college.
For those of us who have begun to think about our post-graduation lives, it’s easy to believe external factors control our destiny. If we give into that type of fearful thinking, the external perceptions limit our aspirations. It is a tough environment outside our campus walls, yet there are also good things in store for those willing to risk and face rejection.
Upon examination, a common thread woven through all of these fears is a lack of knowledge. If we only knew everything that’s going to be on the exam, if we only knew how that guy or girl feels about us, if we only knew what occupation we would find most satisfying, then we could slough off our fears and take courageous action down the path to success.
Knowledge is key, and it’s why we’re at USC in the first place. It’s clear that the university understands, and not only from an academic perspective — job fairs and on-campus activities demonstrate that USC is doing its best to stamp out ignorance and quell fears in every area it can.
We all have fears, both unique and shared with the entire student body. The understood existence of these common fears, however, can bring a sense of belonging and comfort as we realize we are not alone in our insecurities. We also have the choice to acknowledge fear as a call to action, a chance to focus forward while still being grounded in the present.
So the next time you debate whether or not to take that risk, remember that most people around you probably feel the same way.

Saturday marked the ninth anniversary of the terrorist attacks that shook our nation. All of us, whether freshmen or seniors, international students or native Angelenos, know where we were the moment we saw the falling towers for the first time. That day should always be remembered. Unfortunately, Sept. 11 continues to burden us today in Afghanistan.
Savannah Trevino | Daily Trojan
The United States is beginning to close the door on the war in Iraq. Troops are being withdrawn and the country’s security is now being turned over to the Iraqi government. This means that the main focus now shifts back to the war in Afghanistan.
President Barack Obama wants to downsize the military operation in Afghanistan by July 2011, setting a soft deadline much like the one in for Iraq. According to The New York Times, about 50,000 troops of United States’ military force will remain in Afghanistan through 2011, but will aim at assisting rather than superseding Afghanistan’s army and police forces.
Ten months isn’t far from now, but the goals laid out by Gen. David Petraeus and Obama for Afghanistan remain aggressive and idealistic. American causalities are increasing. The Taliban has an unflinching grip over its stronghold in the region of Kandahar, which is thought to be where the Sept. 11 attacks were planned. The Afghan government and army have showed limited progress in their lackluster attempt to take over.
In the United States, public support for the war is at an all-time low.
And yet, the goals of the updated strategy in Afghanistan are to bring a strategic defeat to Al Qaeda by rolling back the Taliban from its strongholds, building Afghan capacity to secure its own territory, and in doing so, denying terrorists a safe haven.
This last goal brings us back to the reason the United States is in Afghanistan in the first place — the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Unfortunately, what might have been a justified and necessary response has evolved into an enduring conflict, one that seems destined to fall short of its goals.
Two of the defining elements of the war are the nature of our opponents: a non-state terrorist organization (Al Qaeda) and an overthrown political and military movement vying for a return to power (the Taliban).
The result has been an awkward and complex situation in which the United States is responsible for defeating those guilty for the attacks and ensuring that Afghanistan doesn’t become a hotbed for terrorists.
Therein lie the complications.
Only a small number of Al Qaeda members (fewer than 100, according to the CIA director Leon Panetta in June) still operate in Afghanistan. Whether Osama Bin Laden is even in Afghanistan remains uncertain. Also, American support of the Afghan government entrenches Washington in an internal struggle for power in a foreign nation. It is a mistake to overlook the fact that there are still Afghans who support the Taliban.
Still, the mission pulls at the emotional and ideological heartstrings  of Americans and Westerners alike. During an interview conducted by NATO TV, Petraeus described the new strategy as “a concept of reintegration, a tactical directive to ensure there is sufficient focus on reducing the loss of civilian life in the conduct of our operations, counter-insurgency guidance, a civil-military campaign plan — not just a military operational plan.” Petraeus attempts to show the American people not only that progress is being made but that a moral air to caution and transitional development are now priorities.
None of the goals outlined above have been accomplished to an acceptable extent. Indeed, success feels elusive and faraway.
For these reasons, the July 2011 deadline is looking more and more like an impeding date of failure.
Though Taliban and Al Qaeda causalities far outnumber American causalities, by next July Al Qaeda will remain a key player throughout the world: The Afghan government will struggle to prove its ability to control the violent ambitions of the Taliban and terrorist organizations will continue to operate in the region.
Ideologically, this scenario poses an unnerving threat in the minds of Americans. Pragmatically, there are other mechanisms besides this war that are capable of preventing a future terrorist attack akin to Sept. 11, the Madrid train bombings or the London bus attacks.
A reinvigorated emphasis on finding objective, coordinated and confident intelligence, especially in regard to nuclear proliferation, should be a priority. Thorough internal policing and strong border inspection also need to be emphasized.
On a wider spectrum, the United States and its allies need to be active in financially supporting foreign governments who are committed to keeping terrorists out of their countries.
The final act of the war in Afghanistan has just begun. Unless the narrative takes a dramatic turn for the better before next summer, our troops will be welcomed home by overjoyed friends and family but will be leaving behind a persisting arena of uncertainty.

Easy A [Rated PG-13]
Superbad’s Emma Stone stars in this hip update of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s classic American novel, The Scarlet Letter. The once-spotless reputation of a high school student is tarnished when she pretends to lose her virginity to her gay friend, resulting in a slew of hopelessly horny classmates asking for the same service. Academy Award nominees Thomas Hayden Church, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson add their comedic chops to this John Hughes-esque teen comedy.
The Town [Rated R]
For anyone that is still doubtful of Ben Affleck’s abilities as a storyteller, The Town should provide convincing evidence to the contrary. His second directing effort focuses on the troubled city of Charlestown, Mass., regarded as the bank robber capital of the United States. Affleck portrays a seasoned thief who falls for a bank employee and must decide between love and his dangerous but lucrative career. The story is familiar; however, the presence of Affleck, John Hamm, Jeremy Renner and Chris Cooper, along with captivating action scenes, should make Affleck’s second outing as a director both a critical and commercial success.
Devil [Rated PG-13]
After the critical beating that he took for this summer’s stinker The Last Airbender, M. Night Shyamalan wisely decided to step away from the directing chair and into a writing and producing position for Devil. In the film, a group of strangers become stuck on an elevator only to discover that an evil force has descended upon them. The thriller should pack in a considerable amount of creeps and frights in its trim 80-minute running time.
Never Let Me Go [Rated R]
British actresses Keira Knightley and Carrie Mulligan star in this drama about a dystopian England in which human beings are cloned for organ donation. The story follows the lives of the two young women as they discover and come to terms with the reality of their situation as donors. Andrew Garfield, of the upcoming The Social Network and Spider-Man reboot, co-stars.

Various sources come out with college polls and rankings all the time — rating schools on everything from academics to aesthetics. But this week USC boasts recognition on six different lists, five from Newsweek’s annual College Rankings and one in a Wall Street Journal Survey listing “Top Recruiting Colleges.”
Although USC was listed No. 24 on the WSJ’s “Top 25 Recruiter Picks”, the university ranked fourth on Newsweek’s “Most Desirable Large Schools” category. Harvard, UPenn and Cornell rounded out the top-three. UCLA was ranked eighth.
USC also placed No. 10 on Newsweek’s “25 Great Schools With Great Weather,” No. 15 on “Most Desirable Urban Schools,” No. 19 among the top “25 Schools for Powerbrokers” and No. 23 for the “Best Gay-Friendly Schools.”
Under Newsweek’s “Education” section, the ranking methodology is described as a process that yields 747 schools, with those meeting three criteria.
First, the school must be in one of the three leading college guides (Fiske’s Guide to Colleges, the Princeton Review’s Best 371 colleges and U.S. News & World Report’s America’s Best Colleges).
Second, the school’s average incoming freshman must have a SAT critical reading and math score of 1150 or higher.
Third, a college must offer a range of different degrees, which excludes specialized institutions such as cosmetology or art schools.
Other Newsweek polls included the “25 Schools Stocked with Jocks,” “25 Schools for Brainiacs” and the “25 Schools for the Service-Minded.”

Photoshop makes the old look younger and the skinny look skinnier. It cuts off people’s hips, arms or heads and attaches them to other body parts floating in the photography editing ether. Now, Photoshop is being accused of making skin lighter.
Actress Gabourey Sidibe, the breakout star of the heart wrenching film Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, is one of four women who got their own cover for Elle magazine’s 25th anniversary special in October. But Amanda Seyfried, Lauren Conrad and Megan Fox all received drastically different treatments than Sidibe for their covers. Although Sidibe’s cover photo is cropped close, showing nothing below her bust, all of the other ladies photos are practically identical full body shots.
The most shocking part of Elle’s cover series is Sidibe’s apparent skin lightening — one that could not be achieved by a overly hot lighting set-up. Sorry Photoshoppers, Elle isn’t convincing anyone that nothing was done to Sidibe’s photo. But at least the young actress is in good ranks — ads featuring singer Beyoncé Knowles and actress Freida Pinto have also been accused of lightening.

Trojan men, you’ve made the right choice: USC has been ranked the second best college in the nation for men by Guyism.com, behind the University of Florida.
The website assigned the rankings by awarding points to schools in five different categories: academics, location/weather, social scene, sports and school traditions. Research was compiled from several college rankings including the Princeton Review, U.S. News & World Report and Playboy’s annual list of top party schools.
USC scored high across the board, from its nationally renowned professional schools to its popular sports teams, which remain competitive despite NCAA sanctions in football and basketball.
The social aspect of USC was important as well, with both a robust Greek system and the dominant nightlife scene of Los Angeles itself contributing greatly. The rankings also favored Southern California’s beautiful weather and the Song Girls.

Cibona Zagreb, a Croatian club team part of the Turkish Airlines Euroleague Basketball league, bolstered the backcourt by adding Marcus Johnson to the team for a one-year deal. Johnson, a Los Angeles native who transferred to USC from UConn in the spring of 2008, played shooting guard for the Trojans last year. He averaged 9.6 points and 4.6 rebounds, while also averaging 1.5 steals a game for the Trojans, making his mark as a defensive force.
Cibona is entering a new era for the club, under a new coach Zdravko Radulović, and the team — which is coming off back-to-back Croatian National League titles — is looking to win its first Euroleague championship since 1986. The addition of Johnson should bring physicality and solid wing play to the team.
Johnson was also a top-100 national recruit coming out of high school, and had a storied career at Westchester High School in Los Angeles, as a two-time All-State and All-City selection.

The Von KleinSmid Center, a central building for classes and student meetings on campus, has recently been upgraded with new square desks and adjustable chairs as part of a larger initiative from the Office of the Provost to update learning spaces on campus.
Desks · Students in class at the Von KleinSmid Center are using new desks this semester after ITS’ efforts to make classrooms more adaptive. - Neha Jain | Daily Trojan 
“The idea behind it was to look at learning spaces and see if they fit the needs of the students and the teachers in the 21st century,” said Joseph Cevetello, director of learning environments from Information Technology Services.
The decision to change the desks and chairs was made after a series of interviews with students and faculty, when ITS decided that mobile and adaptive desks would be added to many of the VKC rooms.
“One of the things that came out of the meetings was that people felt there were a lot of challenges in the VKC learning spaces,” Cevetello said. “The rooms were uncomfortable and the seating was not appropriate, and the spaces seemed very inflexible with what you could do.”
The new desks are meant to provide a more updated classroom that better fit the students and teachers, Cevetello said. All of the desks and chairs now have wheels and the chairs are adjustable to offer more comfort to a wider range of students.
“In the other classroom buildings we tried out other designs,” Cevetello said. “In [the Social Sciences building], we went with tables and chairs and also some new individual desks.”
This upgrade, part of an ongoing initiative, has already renovated 53 classrooms, three auditoriums and three computer labs.
The overall goal is to renovate all 200 learning spaces — classrooms and computer labs — on campus.
Yet students have had mixed reactions regarding the new desks at VKC. Although some students said the furniture looks updated and gives the classrooms a high-tech feel, others are concerned with their effectiveness in providing decent seating in classes with a larger number of students.
“I find the new desk and chair setup to be very uncomfortable,” said Tammy Batzofin, a senior majoring in health and humanity. “I have to crane my body to see the board, since if I come in late the only seats open are the ones with the backs to the teacher. That makes it very uncomfortable to pay attention during class.”
Michelle Gossman, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, agreed.
“I also find the new desks to be a bit of a hassle,” she said. “In my classroom there are just too many people in the class so with the way the desks are oriented only half of the desk space is useful since the other half faces the board.”
Other students said, however, they enjoy the new comfort and space that the desks and chairs provide.
Brandon Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said he liked the new chairs because they are more comfortable, as well as the flexibility of the new furniture.
“You can move the tables around,” Nguyen said. “It does make it more crowded … fewer chairs, fewer desks could be better.

Named by Time magazine as one of the most influential people in the world, Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism Innovator in Residence Jaron Lanier joined Dean Ernest Wilson Wednesday in an open forum about technology in modern society.
In “Self and reality: Finding clarity in the digital noise,” Lanier discussed his past work and current thoughts on today’s technology. Called the “father of virtual reality,” Lanier has been involved with notable innovations and developments with software and hardware for decades.

“[We’re] pursuing the old dream of trying to come up with the right designs for wonderful experience in the furthering along the line of virtual reality,” Lanier said.
Lanier was chosen as the 2010 innovator in residence after recommendations were submitted by faculty. He is Annenberg’s second innovator in residence, after Irving Wladawsky-Berger received the honor in 2009.
“The purpose of the innovator in residence is to provide food for thought around topics related to innovation, creation and technology for our students, faculty and staff,” wrote Carola Weil, associate dean for Planning and Strategic Initiatives at Annenberg, in an e-mail.
At the event, Wilson said Lanier is not only an innovator, but he has also given careful thought to criticizing the central role of technology and innovation.
“The goal is to invite someone who is an innovator in his or her own right to our community here at Annenberg,” Wilson said. “That’s exactly the kind of countercurrent that we want to hear.”
Lanier said he believes that the way trends in technology have shifted are lazy and have a low-quality feeling.
“I have a lot of fun with computers, and yet I happen to think a lot of the particular designs on the surface of this stuff … which includes a lot of the social networking stuff,” Lanier said. “I don’t like this whole trend.”
Lanier argued that progress in technology is eliminating the need for human labor, and that a successful society would preserve its middle class.
“The essential idea is that as machines get better, people ought to be able to earn a living from their hearts and brains,” Lanier said. “The people who aren’t needed will become peasants and will be forgotten and lost.”
Lanier, who is currently working with Microsoft research labs, said he is always trying to evolve and come up with new ideas in the realm of technology.
“There’s the idea that there was a less technological way of doing things … and that there’s a new way of doing things that involve more technology,” Lanier said.

Discipline.
That would be one of the first words that comes to mind when thinking of the difference between former USC coach Pete Carroll and his successor Lane Kiffin.
Close watch · Penalties have been at the center of attention in recent years as USC has consistently ranked in the top-10 teams in the nation in penalty yards. New coach Lane Kiffin hasn’t been able to stop the trend. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
From his first practice in the spring, Kiffin made sure players touched every line during sprints, paid full attention during practice and adhered strictly to the rules. This was a change from Carroll’s ways when players were seen joking around, talking to one another and partying on The Row.
That is not saying that Carroll didn’t have control of his players or that they were disrespectful; it was just another way of coaching. But that loosey-goosey attitude translated onto the field in the form of penalties. Time and time again during Carroll’s reign, it seemed like there was at least one USC player committing a personal foul every week, and he would only get a slap on the wrist from Carroll.
In comes Kiffin, and it appeared that those days were over. Everyone thought Kiffin would run a tight ship and the amount of stupid penalties and penalty yards would decrease.
Except that hasn’t happened.
Just as in previous years, USC ranks near the bottom in the Football Bowl Subdivision in penalties. In the Trojans’ first two games they have accrued the most penalty yardage (240) and are tied for the most number of penalties in the nation (24). Countless times over those first few games those penalties were momentum stoppers.
Take the Virginia game for example. There was the holding penalty that brought back sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley’s 47-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson. There was another holding penalty after a pass on fourth and two that would have resulted in a first down (this coming after the Trojans’ drive was kept alive when a Virginia player ran into the punter on fourth and seven). Those are 14 potential points that were wiped off the board because of penalties.
And let’s not forget the back-to-back personal fouls the Trojans committed late in the fourth quarter with Virginia stuck inside its own 30-yard line and down by 10 points. All USC needed was a three-and-out and the game would have been all but over.
But the signs of the old USC teams, the ones of recent memory coached by Carroll, came to light. First, there was the horse collar tackle redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton committed, and on the very next play sophomore safety T.J. McDonald hit Cavaliers running back Perry Jones a yard and a half out of bounds.
Kiffin, who doesn’t show much emotion, had to be fuming inside at the two personal foul penalties. Luckily, senior corner back Shareece Wright came to the rescue and blocked the field goal kick at the end of that drive to preserve the two possession lead.
Oh yeah, and redshirt junior tight end Rhett Ellison was kicked out of the game with four seconds left after USC recovered an onside kick. No one still knows why.
It’s understandable if you were watching the Virginia game and thought you saw a bundle of energy in gray hair on the sidelines. During the last three years, USC has been notorious for committing a large amount of penalties.
In 2007, USC had the third most penalty yards per game in the nation with 74.4. The Trojans showed a little improvement in 2008, averaging 1.5 penalty yards less per game. That 72.9 average was still the fourth most in the country, however. 2009 saw the biggest progression of all, as the Trojans averaged just 61.4 penalty yards per game, which still ranked 26th out of 120 teams.
So for USC football, there’s a new coach but same old story.
Kiffin tried to curb USC’s discipline problem on the field after the Hawai’i game but to no avail. He also said he mentioned it in the locker room after the Virginia game. But he decided that his tactics aren’t working, so he’s resorting to some reverse psychology.
“We’ve gone the other way with it,” Kiffin told reporters earlier in the week. “Maybe our players were drawn to it because we paid so much attention to it, so we’re not going to talk about it, because it can’t get worse.”
For USC to compete for a Pac-10 championship this year, it needs to cut down on the penalties. The Trojans already have a thin roster after losing some quality talent over the summer and they need all the help they can get. By committing infractions left and right, USC is shooting itself in the foot. If it comes across a team with a decent field goal kicker and offense (unlike Virginia), the Trojans could lose one of these close games next time, thanks to a careless mistake here and there.
So before the Trojans take the field Saturday and practically give Minnesota a chance to win with careless penalties, they need to take care of the opponent currently beating them.
Themselves.

After two games, the Trojans are still searching for their identity.
The results of the first two weeks have been inconclusive. The offense looked explosive against Hawai’i, then followed up with a dud against Virginia. Conversely, the Trojan defense was full of holes in week one, then held the Cavaliers to 14 points the following game.
Opening · Redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler has started both games for the Trojans this year despite rarely seeing the field in his first three years. Tyler said he’s getting comfortable in the starting role. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan 
For USC coach Lane Kiffin and his first-year coaching staff, the search for identity is a work in progress.
“We’ll continually be in the process of figuring out our team and who we are,” Kiffin said. “We’ve seen two drastically different games from different sides of the ball, so the challenge this week is to put it all together and see if we can play a complete game.”
Redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler is a good example of that search for consistency. After breaking out for 154 yards in his first start, Tyler (and the rest of the USC offense) relapsed, finishing with 68 yards against Virginia.
Tyler sees “a team that hasn’t been consistent on both sides of the ball.
“But we know we can be,” he said.
Tyler places some of the inconsistency on inexperienced players new roles. Even though he is in his fourth year at USC, he includes himself in that category.
“I don’t know if I’m nervous; it’s just not a lot of game experience,” Tyler said.
However, Tyler said he is getting comfortable in the starting role.
“I feel good now and I’m ready to have a big game,” he said.
Still, a solid team identity continues to elude the Trojans.
“We have no idea,” Kiffin said. “It takes a while to develop identities. Things don’t change over night … It’s a process.”
Kiffin hopes the Trojans will eventually develop into a more forceful team on the gridiron.
“We’re not disciplined right now,” Kiffin said. “I think we’re tough but I don’t think we’re disciplined at all.”
USC has been penalized 24 times for 240 yards, which is the highest total in the Football Bowl Subdivision.
—
Defensive fatigue has been a concern for the Trojans in their first two games, Kiffin said. Since the Trojans were not able to pull away in either contest, the defense started to wear down in the fourth quarter.
“We don’t rotate very much,” Kiffin said. “We’re going to try to do a little more of that. We’ve been trying to develop our depth.”
As part of the NCAA sanctions, players were allowed to transfer without having to pay the usual price of sitting out a year.
The players that took the opportunity and transferred could have been seeing significant playing time right now. Defensive end Malik Jackson (Tennessee) and fullback D.J. Shoemate (UConn) could have been of great use in backup roles had they stayed with USC.
“It’s hurt us not being able to rotate people,” Kiffin said. “We go to try to rest a defensive end and our defensive end is starting at Tennessee. We go to rest a fullback and he’s playing at UConn.”
Kiffin said it would be good practice for the Trojans as they become accustomed to playing in a sanctioned program. After all, the Trojans are allowed to have 75 scholarship players under the NCAA ruling but will bring only 53 scholarship players on the road to Minnesota.

Defensive linemen sophomore Nick Perry and junior Armond Armstead were limited in practice for the second day in a row. Kiffin moved up redshirt freshman defensive end James Boyd from the service squad to try to strengthen the team’s depleted line.
“We’ve got to find some depth for some guys to rotate, number one, and then, if guys get hurt, to really play and have a role for us,” Kiffin said.

After former USC running back Reggie Bush officially forfeited his 2005 Heisman Trophy Tuesday, the Heisman Trophy Trust met Wednesday and announced it would not re-award the trophy.
“As a result of Reggie Bush’s decision to forfeit his title as Heisman winner of 2005, the Trustees have determined that there will be no Heisman Trophy winner for the year 2005,” a statement from the Trust said.
The NCAA deemed Bush ineligible for the 2005 season and hit USC hard with sanctions when it was discovered that Bush, along with one-and-done basketball player O.J. Mayo, accepted lavish gifts from outside agents during their time at USC.
The NCAA’s discoveries gave the Trust the opportunity to take away Bush’s award on account of his ineligibility in the 2005 season. By giving up his Trophy willingly, however, Bush avoided that scenario and said he is dedicated to helping the Trust in the future.
“It was a difficult decision to return the Heisman Trophy and he exhibited great character in acknowledging his mistakes and accepting the consequences,” the Trust said.
This is the first time in its 75-year history that the Heisman Trophy has been returned by one of its recipients.
Former Texas quarterback Vince Young, who was the runner-up to Bush for the award in 2005, said he is not disappointed the Trust did not retroactively award him the prize.
“I would not want to have it, and don’t want the trophy,” Young, who is now the Tennessee Titans quarterback, said to reporters on Wednesday. “Like I said, 2005 Reggie Bush is the Heisman Trophy winner. Why would I want it?”

Strong finishes from the two most experienced members of the No. 1 USC women’s golf team led to a third- place finish at the 2010 Texas A&M Fall Preview.

The season-opening tournament, held at the Traditions Golf Club in College Station, Texas — the site of the women’s 2011 NCAA championship tournament — featured a revamped lineup for the Women of Troy, a team that has had to replace three of five starters. With only senior Lizette Salas and sophomore Cyna Rodriguez returning from last year’s NCAA runner-up roster, the Women of Troy needed their three new members to immediately contribute.
Their contributions led to a team score of 8-under-par 856 (289-282-285), seven strokes back from No. 4 Alabama at 15-under-par 849 (286-280-283) and six strokes behind No. 16 LSU at 14-under-par 850 (287-283-280).
“Obviously, I wish that we could go in and win,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “I think it gave us a nice opportunity to acclimate and bring new players into the lineup.”
The team was led by three-time All-American Salas, who finished third at 6-under-par 210 (70-70-70). Salas played consistently well throughout the tournament, as evidenced by her consecutive rounds of 70, but perhaps never better than her two birdie, 16-par final round. Her consistency will be counted on by Gaston this year to lead a talented but young roster.
One shot behind Salas was junior transfer Lisa McCloskey at 5-under-par 211 (74-70-67), whose final round was the team’s strongest of the tournament. McCloskey’s final round shot her up the leaderboard to a fourth-place finish. The two-time All-American at Pepperdine had a final round of five birdies, 13 pars  and no bogeys in her first tournament for USC. A pair of top-10 finishes is a nice start to the season for the two oldest members of the Women of Troy, who will be counted on to fill the void left by last season’s departures.
Freshman Rachel Morris tied for 18th at even-par 216 (73-72-71). Morris improved every round of her collegiate debut and finished with a birdie on the final hole of the tournament.
“Rachel played great,” Salas said. “She came in the top 20, which is really good for a first tournament.”
Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez slipped after a promising start to the tournament to tie for 30th at 4-over-par 220 (72-74-80). She took a quadruple bogey on the sixth hole of the final round and never quite recovered. Rounding out the Women of Troy was freshman Sophia Popov, also making her collegiate debut. Popov tied for 67th at 12-over-par 228 (75-76-77).
Overall, Gaston said she was pleased with the early season performance of the team, especially the new members.
“I certainly felt like there were a lot of good things that happened this week,” she said. “But we always come away feeling like we could do better than how we finished.”
For the team, that means constant competition for spots as it looks to improve on its third-place finish. With junior Inah Park, also a member of last year’s NCAA runner-up roster looking to return to the competitive roster for the tournament no roster spot is safe. “We’ll continue to work hard and more than anything try and identify any of our weaknesses and try to get better throughout the season,” Gaston said.
The Women of Troy resume competitive play Sept. 24 at the Mason Rudolph Women’s Championship at the  Vanderbilt Legends Golf Club in Nashville, Tenn.
