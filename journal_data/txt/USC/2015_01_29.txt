Following a winless two-game road trip, the USC men’s basketball team currently sits at 9-10 on the year and 1-6 in Pac-12 play. Despite a highly touted freshman class, the best USC has seen in years, the Trojans look poised to finish with a losing record and sit at the bottom of the Pac-12 for a third consecutive year.
It wasn’t so long ago, however, that USC basketball seemed ready to make the jump into the Pac-12’s elite. The Trojans made the NCAA tournament three years in a row from 2007-2009 and were recruiting high level players, including NBA star guard Demar DeRozan, who were capable of bringing out a program that for so long was in the shadows of USC football.
Then the NCAA came asking questions.
Former guard and current NBA player O.J. Mayo had been accused of accepting benefits and cash from an agency in Northern California. Former head coach Tim Floyd was also accused of funneling the money to the agency. Mayo was found guilty, and Floyd then proceeded to step down as coach.
During the 2010 season, a year after the Trojans had won the   Pac-10 tournament, USC announced it would be self-imposing a one-year postseason ban and would vacate all wins from the 2007-2008 season, Mayo’s one and only season at USC.
Bam.
All the possibilities of building a long-lasting program that could contend for conference championships and make deep NCAA tournament runs were done.
The sanctions put even more pressure on a program that was struggling with the resignation of Floyd. During the investigation, Derrick Williams, an eventual     No. 2 overall pick in the NBA draft, decomitted from USC and went to Arizona, where he would win a Pac-10 championship and lead the Wildcats to an Elite Eight appearance.
Along with Williams, USC lost four other top recruits in Solomon Hill, Renardo Sidney, Noel Johnson and Lamont Jones. Hill and Jones would team up with Williams at Arizona and play key roles in the Wildcats’ 2010-11 Pac-10 championship run.
Furthermore, because of USC’s self-imposed postseason ban and recruiting restrictions, the program was able to only bring in one recruit for the 2011-2012 season, and the program never recovered.
The next three years would be hard to watch as the Trojans could only manage a record of 31-65, capped off by two last place finishes in the Pac-12 during that stretch.
I’m not trying to use these sanctions as an excuse for a program that sits in the middle of one of the nation’s largest recruiting hotbeds. I am simply trying to preach patience and give upset fans, especially those of whom are current USC students, an explanation for why the basketball team has been struggling so mightily as of late.
The Trojans have had a past with the NCAA that I highlighted in my previous column last Friday. For some reason the NCAA just loves to punish USC, mostly unjustly, and while the football team has faired quite well through crippling sanctions, the basketball team has had a hard time turning things around.
USC hired Andy Enfield to help right the ship for a struggling program, especially win terms of recruiting. And he has done just that. This season, Enfield landed a top-20 recruiting class, led by guards Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin, and two ESPN Top 100 recruits have already signed on for next season.
A coach doesn’t just turn around a program in a year or two, however. It takes time. Heck, even Coach Krzyzewski struggled during his first years at Duke, and now he has 1,000 wins and four national championships to his name.
I’m not saying that Enfield will become the next Coach K, but I am a true believer that the former Florida Gulf Coast coach can succeed at USC.
USC has never been a big basketball school like that university across the 10 for reasons unknown, but it has all the resources that could push it to the top — state-of-the-art athletic facilities, a strong fan base, an athletic director that wants to win now, and yeah, it’s in beautiful, sunny Southern California, a main draw for recruits.
Nick Barbarino is a junior majoring in business administration. His column “Beyond the Arc” runs Fridays.
George, I dunno.  If one was to use that logic, it is important to remember that basketball is still a net gain by far whereas women’s sports are uniformly not.   So if we wanted to uset that logic we would simply cut women’s sports as much as Title IX would allow and fight to get rid of Title IX itself. 
But on to basketball.  Basketball doesn’t work that way does it?  All the one and dones means the top programs actually have a lot of turn over from year to year and have to be measured by their ability to have a system and recruiting to build a contender each year.
Perhaps we should consider dissolving the men’s basketball team and using that money to fund other sports.  Football doesn’t need the money, but the other sports, especially women’s, would surely benefit.

The USC women’s tennis team will travel to Malibu on Friday to take on Pepperdine for the second time in less than a week.
After four days off and coming off of a weekend championship, the Women of Troy get back on the court against the No. 30 ranked Waves. The team took down Pepperdine in the championship match of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Kick-Off Weekend. In Sunday’s match, the Women of Troy (3-0) pulled off a sweep with a score of 4-0.
Coming off of such a convincing win, it would be easy to fall into the trap of complacency. The team has been working tirelessly, however, to not only prevent a drop-off, but also increase its intensity. Senior Gabriella DeSimone was able to provide insight into how the team competed so effectively.
“We got a good jump,” DeSimone said. “We started off strong with doubles and continued that momentum with singles.”
One of DeSimone’s coaches also gave her take on what to expect from the Waves this time around.
“I’d imagine it would be a closer match,” said assistant coach Barbara Hallquist DeGroot on what USC is expecting from Pepperdine this time around. “It’ll be a good test.”
Pepperdine’s top ranked player is No. 17 Lorraine Guillermo, who will pose a challenge for the Women of Troy.
One of the most difficult aspects of the upcoming match will be the fact that the Waves have home-court advantage.
“They’ll be a lot more fired up,” said DeGroot.  It seems the players are aware of this new challenge and ready to face it head-on.
“Home court is a different atmosphere,” said sophomore Zoë Katz. “We’re just going into it with a lot of energy and competitive spirit.”
Despite the fact that USC has been able to complete sweeps of each of its opponents thus far, the team is preparing for a vengeful Pepperdine team.
Another dynamic that makes Friday’s match one to keep an eye on is the fact that many of the players on both squads have grown up together and competed against each other since they were young.
“It’s nice at the end of the day when you can hug them after a match,” said Katz. “It isn’t going to change how you’re acting on the court.”
Such a killer competitive streak is something that has certainly contributed to USC’s success on the court thus far this season.
“Across the board, from top to bottom, there is such great depth,” said DeGroot. “They are such a cohesive group, they have one mindset, and they’re having a great time while they do it.”
The Women of Troy insist that they are not playing with chips on their shoulders, despite not having moved up in the ITA rankings. USC is still hanging tough at the No. 14 spot.
“If we keep winning, the ranking will come,” DeGroot said. “It’s so early in the season, it’s easy to get caught up in the ranking.” The rankings don’t mean much to the team when all they’re doing is “concentrating on winning,” where the coaching staff believes the focus remains.
Since USC first faced off against Pepperdine in 1977, the Women of Troy are 44-12 against the Waves. This impressive record includes the sweep last Sunday and a 5-2 victory last year.
DeSimone summed up her team’s mentality quite completely: “We have to forget that we just played them and beat them.”

The USC women’s basketball team will head up the Pacific this weekend to take on  No. 7-ranked Oregon State (18-1, 8-0 Pac-12) on Saturday, Jan. 31 at 2:30 p.m. in Corvallis and Oregon (8-11, 1-7 Pac-12) on Monday, Feb. 2 at 5 p.m. in Eugene.
The Women of Troy (11-8, 3-5 Pac-12) will look to end their current three-game losing skid. They’re coming off of a pair of home losses, a 67-53 loss to California and a 71-60 loss to Stanford. After a close first half against the Golden Bears, Cal got hot during the second half to put the game out of reach. The game against Stanford was a more consistent affair, but an early 15-1 run by the Cardinal put the Women of Troy in a hole quickly, and despite a strong effort, they were unable to dig themselves out of it.
Sophomore guard Jordan Adams led the team with a combined 32 points over the weekend, including her first career double-double against Stanford (21 points, 10 rebounds). Senior forward Kaneisha Horn also picked up a double-double against the Cardinal with 11 points and 11 rebounds, the second of her career.
“With the Stanford plays defense, they sag a lot sometimes, and they force us to make outside shots, and we just didn’t knock them down,” said Horn. “If we would’ve had more balanced scoring with the starting five and the people coming off the bench, I think it would’ve been a different game.”
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama leads the team with 12.8 points and 6.9 rebounds per game. Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert is averaging 10.9 points, while junior guard Brianna Barrett has 10.5 points per game, and leads the team with 4.2 assists.
The Women of Troy will look to get more production off of their bench, which only scored a combined 13 points over their last two games.
“We have a few things that we need to work out, but scoring off the bench is just one of them,” said Cooper.
USC split their two games against Oregon State and Oregon early this year, using a strong second-half to beat the Ducks 70-54, but falling 76-66 to the Beavers. USC is 44-17 all-time against Oregon and the winner of three straight in the series, and 41-21 all-time against Oregon State, including 2-1 last season.
USC’s three-game losing streak has dropped them down to No. 8 in the Pac-12 standings, but head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke isn’t especially focused on that.
“I don’t know if there’s any more pressure than I feel right now,” said Cooper. “I’m not a big pressure person. Every game is important for me, so just because they’re Cal and Stanford didn’t make it any more or any less pressure than I feel going up to the Oregon schools. For us, we need to get back on the winning track, and we do that by digging our heels in the ground, playing solid defense, and making some plays.”
Ruth Hamblin leads Oregon State with 14.5 points and 9.3 rebounds per game.  Jamie Weisner has 13.1 points and 6.5 points per game, while Sydney Wiese is averaging 12.3 points and a team-leading 6.1 assists per game. The Beavers are coming off a 73-55 win over Arizona, and a 68-57 win over then No. 13 ranked Arizona State.
Meanwhile, Oregon is coming off a 70-58 loss to the Sun Devils and an 81-78 overtime loss to the Wildcats. The Ducks are led by Jillian Alleyne’s 16.5 points and 14.7 rebounds per game, with Lexi Bando adding 11.4 points per game and Lexi Petersen adding 11.2 points and 4.1 assists per game. Alleyne has led his team with double-digit rebounds in every game this season.
The Women of Troy will return home the following weekend to try and sweep Utah (6-13, 0-8 Pac-12) on Friday, Feb. 6 at 7 p.m. and Colorado (9-10, 2-6      Pac-12) on Sunday, Feb. 8 at 12 p.m.
They will then head up to the Bay Area, looking for revenge against Stanford on Friday, Feb. 13 at 6:00 p.m. and California on Sunday, Feb. 15 at 6:30 p.m.

The USC Trojans (9-11, 1-7 Pac-12) took a heartbreaking 98-94 loss to the Colorado Buffaloes (11-9, 4-4) 98-94 in triple overtime Wednesday night at the Galen Center.
Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily TrojanClose but no cigar · Redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt had his best game in a Trojan uniform since transferring from UNLV, but his team was unable to get the win.
Redshirt sophomore Reinhardt had a career night for the Trojans with 35 points including 9-18 from behind the arc. His nine threes tied a USC record. Sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic was a consistent scoring threat throughout the night and finished the game with 30 points and 9 rebounds. Freshman guard Jordan McLaughlin posted a balanced stat line with 11 points, 7 assists and 7 rebounds,  but only shot 3-13 from the field and 5-12 from the line. McLaughlin was held scoreless until two minutes into the second half, and he struggled shooting the ball all night.
In triple overtime, it was up to McLaughlin to lead the team after Reinhardt fouled out. McLaughlin continued to attack the basket and get to the line, but it was senior guard Askia Booker who led the way down the stretch for Colorado with his clutch shooting, including the                 go-ahead free throws at the end.
In double overtime, Reinhardt and Booker went back and forth, but it was Jovanovic who hit the shot late to give the Trojans the late lead before Booker hit a floater to send the game to a third overtime.
In overtime, redshirt sophomore Darion Clark provided a spark with clutch rebounding and free throws. But it was junior guard Xavier Johnson who hit a three with 30 seconds left to tie the game. McLaughlin, once again, had a chance to win the game at the buzzer but his shot rolled off the rim to send the game to double overtime.
McLaughlin missed a contested layup at the end of regulation that would have won the game for USC.
Booker led the way for Colorado with 43 points and overcame a hard foul by Jovanovic in the second half to keep the Buffs ahead most of the second half and eventually led them to the victory. Booker did a lot of damage from the line as he shot 13-15 from the stripe. Freshman forward Tory Miller scored 11 points and added 13 rebounds and Xavier Johnson added 12 points for the Buffs, despite fouling out in double overtime, who were balanced scoring all around.
Jovanovic started off the contest going 5-5 from the field before he finally missed a shot late in the first half. Reinhardt had 16 points in the first half when he shot 6-12 from the field including 4-9 from behind the arc. USC had a strong first half overall as they led 38-37 and shot 46.4 percent from the field.
USC next faces the 11th ranked Utah Runnin’ Utes (16-4, 6-2), Sunday at the Galen Center. Utah is led by head coach Larry Krystkowiak and senior guard Delon Wright. Wright leads his squad in both points and assists and has been in the conversation all year for the Wooden Award which is awarded to the most outstanding college basketball player every year. Utah is coming off a loss against UCLA (12-9, 4-4).

Despite singlehandedly launching the Marvel superhero juggernaut more than a half-century ago, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby’s Fantastic Four has never gotten the big-screen treatment it so richly deserves.
Back in 1994, producer Roger Corman’s comically awful take on the superhuman quartet was never officially released, and today the movie remains little more than a curio for convention bootleggers. Tim Story’s 2005 Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, meanwhile, managed to pull down respectable box office numbers but quickly faded from the public’s memory due to aggressively bland scripts that wasted a talented cast, including future Captain America star Chris Evans, who played the brash young Human Torch, and decades of fertile mythology.
Fox, hoping the fourth time would be the charm for the property, hired filmmaker Josh Trank to reboot the franchise in 2012. Trank was brought on board mainly due to the success of his debut feature Chronicle, a found-footage sci-fi thriller that played as a dark inversion of superhero origin stories, complete with nods to Katsuhiro Otomo’s apocalyptic anime Akira and Brian De Palma’s adaptation of Stephen King’s Carrie. The director seemed like a solid, unconventional choice at the time, and he still does, but his Fantastic Four has already been the subject of a deluge of criticism from irate Marvel fans, most of it arriving months before anyone had seen a single frame of the finished film.
So what’s with all the hate? Much of it stems from an early announcement that Trank’s creative team would be taking their cues from the 2004 Ultimate Fantastic Four comic series, a polarizing alternate-universe continuity that made several drastic changes to the team’s classic origin, meaning the fire-bending Human Torch, his force field-generating older sister the Invisible Woman, her super-stretchy scientist crush Mr. Fantastic and their thick-skinned mutual friend the Thing will all be significantly younger, sexier and more angst-ridden than viewers remember them.
Those grumbles escalated into a full-scale uproar when it was revealed that Trank and his co-screenwriters Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Days of Future Past) and Jeremy Slater (the upcoming horror movie The Lazarus Effect) were demoting the team’s arch-nemesis Dr. Victor von Doom from the iron-fisted dictator of the fictional Eastern European country of Latveria to a disgruntled Internet blogger named Victor Domashev whose hacker alias happens to be “Doom.” That’s right, what at first seemed like an elaborate bit of trolling actually turned out to be the bitterly ironic truth. For my fellow Batman fans, this would be the equivalent of Warner Bros. suddenly recasting the Joker as a loveable jaywalking mime.
Since those reveals, nearly every piece of news related to the film has been received by the blogosphere with the same amount of enthusiasm as an approaching colonoscopy. Everything from leaked set photos to out-of-context quotes from the actors involved was regularly held up as evidence of the movie’s inevitable mediocrity. So it was a genuine surprise when the majority of Marvel fans greeted the film’s first teaser trailer, posted online this past Tuesday, with cautious optimism and even outright praise.
While a trailer is almost never a reliable means of assessing a movie’s quality, the Fantastic Four teaser is an exceptionally well-crafted piece of salesmanship based on two major factors: the uniqueness of its tone – Trank’s directorial style owes more to David Cronenberg than Joss Whedon – and the strength of its gifted young cast, including Miles Teller, who earned raves in last year’s phenomenal Whiplash, as Mr. Fantastic, Kate Mara, late of Netflix’s House of Cards, as the Invisible Woman, Michael B. Jordan from the critically acclaimed racial drama Fruitvale Station as the first non-Caucasian Human Torch (one assumes he and Mara’s characters are no longer biological siblings) and Jamie Bell, last seen in Bong Joon-ho’s locomotive sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, as the Thing.
Another interesting aspect of the teaser is the fact that we almost never see our heroes in costume. Instead we’re presented with a group of close friends recovering from a horrific accident (in the original comic, the characters were bombarded with cosmic rays during an ill-advised scientific mission in outer space) and adjusting to their newfound abilities with varying degrees of success and suffering. It looks startlingly grim given the source material, but not in a way that feels derivative or arbitrary.
So why is it so damn difficult to make Marvel’s “first family” work on the big screen? Many would argue it actually isn’t. Brad Bird and Pixar took Lee and Kirby’s core concept of a dysfunctional but loving family of superheroes and created The Incredibles, a brilliant pastiche of comic book tropes and James Bond aesthetics that encapsulated the whiz-bang spirit of Marvel even better than the company’s own current cinematic universe. If Trank is able to take Lee’s patented “heroes with hang-ups” dynamic and marry it to a PG-13 level of grit and intensity, the results could be truly fantastic. If not, well, there’s always the fifth time around.

It’s that time of the year again. The time when fans gather around the television with loved ones to enjoy one of America’s greatest pastimes — football. Yes, Super Bowl Sunday is upon us.
The team you root for, however, isn’t as important as what you’re eating throughout the game. Let’s face it, sports are much more fun with finger food.
Pizza, wings, chips, dips and beer are staples at any Super Bowl party. Calories don’t count on Super Bowl Sunday, but what about those people who understand their bodies aren’t burning energy by merely watching a sports game? Are they doomed to stick to celery sticks and baby carrots? Not necessarily.
Here are two recipes for the health conscious that don’t sacrifice flavor or fun while still holding their own on the dining table.

All the flavor of Buffalo wings sans chicken, these will please even those who have nightmares of their mother telling them to eat their broccoli and cauliflower or there won’t be any dessert. Adapted from the blog Persnickety Plates.
Ingredients:
• 1 head of cauliflower
For the batter:
• 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
• 1/2 cup water
• Dash of Frank’s Wing Sauce (or Frank’s Original Hot Sauce)
• 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
• 1/4 teaspoon dried onion
For the Buffalo sauce:
• 1/4 cup wing sauce
• 3 tablespoons salted butter, melted
• Pinch of salt
• Chili to taste
 
Preheat the oven to 450 fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with tin foil and spray with non-stick spray and set aside. Wash your head of cauliflower and cut into pieces.
In a medium bowl, mix together the batter ingredients. It will be fairly thick. Dip each piece of cauliflower into the batter until fully and evenly coated. Place onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake for about 15 minutes until the batter just hardens. In a small bowl, mix together the buffalo sauce ingredients.
Once the cauliflower is done, remove from the oven and brush with the Buffalo sauce. Again, fully and evenly coat each piece.
Put back into the oven and bake for a few more minutes, until the sauce has mostly dried and the cauliflower is crispy.
Remove from the oven, let cool and enjoy.
“Cheesecake Factory” Avocado Rolls
These were discovered after eating at the Cheesecake Factory and rushing to Google to find the actual recipe or a close knockoff. The cilantro dipping sauce alone is good enough to use on other foods. This recipe is adapted from the blog Damn Delicious. Full disclosure: Frying the rolls in vegetable oil might kill the “healthy vibe,” so it wouldn’t be a bad idea to use olive oil or put them in the oven until they get crispy.
Ingredients:
• 1 cup vegetable oil
• 3 avocados, halved, peeled and seeded
• 1 roma tomato, diced
• 1/4 cup diced red onion
• 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves
• Juice of 1 lime
• Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
• 8 egg roll wrappers
For the cilantro dipping sauce
• 3/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, loosely packed
• 1/3 cup sour cream
• 1 jalapeno, seeded and deveined (optional)
• 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
• 1 clove garlic
• Juice of 1 lime
• Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
 
To make the cilantro dipping sauce, combine cilantro, sour cream, jalapeno, mayonnaise, garlic and lime juice in the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium high heat.
In a medium bowl, gently mash avocados using a potato masher. Add tomato, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, salt and pepper to taste. Gently toss to combine.
Working one at a time, place avocado mixture in the center of each wrapper. Bring the bottom edge of the wrapper tightly over the filling, folding in the sides. Continue rolling until the top of the wrapper is reached. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrapper with water, pressing to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers and avocado mixture.
Working in batches, add egg rolls to the Dutch oven and fry until evenly golden brown and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Serve immediately with cilantro dipping sauce.

For some Republicans in Congress, no strategies are off limits for waging an agenda of discord, chaos and confusion throughout President Barack Obama’s second term. This time, the thorn in a functioning government is Speaker of the House John Boehner’s invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress, an invitation Netanyahu has, for mind-boggling reasons, accepted.
The speech makes little sense from a practical perspective and damages Netanyahu’s support in the United States and Israel. Moreover, it threatens to derail already precarious negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program. Obama, who favors the negotiations, has split with Republicans and Democrats in Congress who favor imposing greater sanctions instead of diplomacy. A positive sign came when 10 Democrats signed a letter agreeing not to vote on a sanctions bill at least until the March 24 deadline — but Boehner’s actions undid all of that.
Gridlock for the sake of political gamesmanship is one brand of silliness, but gridlock that plays poker with national security chips is a careless sham that is unbecoming of elected officials. Consider the timeline: Netanyahu, who Forbes calls “the Republican Senator from Israel,” is up for re-election on March 17. The deadline for current nuclear negotiations with Iran is March 24. Netanyahu will speak on March 3. When Netanyahu urges Congress to ramp up sanctions, the delicate negotiations with Iran are likely to collapse. It is a move so unprecedentedly dim-witted that Bloomberg reported that Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, has broken ranks with Netanyahu and warned American officials that more sanctions would all but guarantee the breakdown of talks.
A new round of sanctions would also be useless. Not only has the current round of sanctions decimated the Iranian economy, but so too have record low oil prices. New sanctions would be the equivalent of beating a dead horse.
In inviting Netanyahu, Boehner was clearly hoping to force the Democrats into an uncomfortable box: to support the speech (presumably, a call for more sanctions) and be anti-Obama, or to oppose the speech and be seen as anti-Israel, a dangerous path given the massive political clout held by pro-Israel interests like AIPAC.
Fortunately, Boehner has confused being pro-Netanyahu with being pro-Israel, and the speech can only hurt Israeli relations. Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the United States, said: “It’s advisable to cancel the speech to Congress so as not to cause a rift with the American government.” The White House released a statement saying that because of protocol, Obama would not meet with Netanyahu due to the closeness of his visit to the upcoming Israeli elections. Forbes even called the speech Netanyahu’s “fatal political mistake” due to a poll that puts the Labor-Hatnuah coalition ahead of Netanyahu’s Likud Party in the election.
The move may backfire for sanction-hungry Republicans on the home front, too. The New York Times argued that Boehner’s move might actually bring Obama and pro-sanction Democrats closer together by strengthening the Democrats’ resolve to be patient on increasing sanctions until after the negotiation deadline. When it rains for Republicans, it pours.
For a party so indebted to the Constitution, the Republican House leadership’s decision to receive Netanyahu shows that they are willing to selectively ignore the law of the land when it befits their politics. According to Michael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, inviting Netanyahu to speak is unconstitutional. While Netanyahu himself cannot violate the Constitution because he is not bound by it, Congress has no Article 1, Section 8 authority to receive foreign leaders. That power is exclusively reserved for the president in Article II, Section 3: “he [the President] shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers.” The Netanyahu debacle underscores why such a clause exists: If the nation were unable to speak with one voice on diplomatic matters, foreign policy would be a disaster, and Congress might as well have their own secretary of state.
Netanyahu should cancel the trip, or Boehner’s office should rescind the invitation. At the very least, Netanyahu (or Boehner) should delay the speech until after the negotiation deadline and during the Israeli “lame duck” period. By allowing the negotiation to run its course, Netanyahu could offer his thoughts on the future with Iran that would not go unheard. Following protocol, Obama would also be able to meet with Netanyahu, the only caveat is that due to the speech stunt, Obama’s guest might be the former, and not the incoming,  Israeli prime minister.
Nathaniel Haas is a junior majoring in political science and economics. His column, “State of the Union,” runs Fridays. 
I think we should help Abbas and his dear friends and allies Hamas create a Palestinian state.  Since Hamas is more popular than Abbas let’s call it Hamasistan.  It could be based on all the other Islamist states.  Women would have zero
rights.  Gays would be hung.  Jews would be verboten.  Non-Muslims would be killed unless they convert to Islam or pay a crippling tax that is designed just for them.  
I think this makes a lot of sense and is something college punks should march for, shout about, and pretend they care about.  The world needs another Islamist state.  What will we do without one more cesspool Islamic state…especially if it replaces the only Jewish state in the world – a productive state contributing advances in all walks of life.  
In Hamasistan criminals will be punished by being tied to the back of jeeps and skinned to death on dirt roads.  The lucky criminals will simply be pushed off
rooftops, and if they’re really lucky the rooftop will be very, very high.
In Hamasistan they will blame all their problems on Israel that way the politicians can line their Swiss Vaults with endless international aid money and not be held accountable.
In Hamasistan they will shoot rockets into Israel during rush hour and when schools get out.  That’s the way they do things in Hamasistan.  Then they will blame Israel for making them do it.  
Yes, this will solve all the problems just ask any leftist, liberal, dreaming moron and he will scream it at you as if there is no doubt about it.
I find it very strange that the editors of the DT or this writer have censored my response to this article.. Why? My comments were not hateful or nefarious in any way. I provided a counter commentary and approved of the position of @Counterofbeans…. Where’s the ability for open, honest discourse these days?
Open discourse and debate in the free market of ideas are
founding principles of our country, and should be the essence of a USC
education. So it is very surprising to read a student editorial which argues
that anyone’s ideas should not be heard. The US Administration does not control
Congress (another sacred founding principle) and should not try to dictate who
may address Congress. The Prime Minister of Israel’s sole objective is to get
the world to understand that the present course of “negotiations” (in
quotes since Iran has given nothing in the P5 + 1 discussions, and received
billions in return) is leading to a Iran in possession of nuclear weapons.
Iranian leaders have stated that they intend to obliterate Israel, and there is
no reason to doubt them. Congress does not want to impose additional sanctions
during the current negotiations; they only want to ensure that additional
sanctions will be imposed on Iran if there is no deal. Sanctions brought Iran
to the table, and it is only the threat of additional sanctions that will
motivate them to give up their nuclear ambitions.

Nathaniel, 
I’m constantly congratulating liberals on their being elected as spokes’tards for Islam.
Additionally Republicans are constantly bringing up the founding fathers, Maybe they should read what GW and TJ had to say; “It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world”: it was George Washington’s Farewell Address to us. The inaugural pledge of Thomas Jefferson was no less clear: “Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations-entangling alliances with none.”
” it threatens to derail already precarious negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program”. Iran is not interested in negotiating with Obama. The leaders of Iran know they are facing a total whimp who will give them whatever they want. Obama took the missle shield away from Poland and the Czech Republic and got nothing in return from Putin. In Syria he drew red line in the sand and when push came to shove he folded his cards. When Putin occupied parts of the Crimea last year, Obama did nothing. He also did nothing when a Russian missle shot down that Malaysian airliner. He negotiated with the Castro Brothers to restore diplomatic relations and got nothing. At least when JFK negotiated with Fidel over 50 years ago he got 1,200 cuban cigars for his troubles. Obama didn’t even get one cigar and he did nothing to improve freedom for the Cuban people. Neogitiations with Iran over the nuclear weapons has hit one deadline after another and each time nothing happened. Obama is tougher on our best ally in the Middle East then he is on Iran. It isn’t Netanyahu who is the chickens__t but Obama.
With friends like Israel who needs enemy’s?
– In 1952 in the so-called Lavon Affair the Israelis were prepared to blow up a U.S. Information Center in Alexandria and blame it on the Egyptians.
– In the 1960s Israelis stole enriched uranium from a lab in Pennsylvania to build atom bombs. They also obtained nuclear triggers through a spying operation run by Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan that included current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
– In 1967, the Israelis attacked and nearly sank the American vessel USS Liberty in international waters, killing 34 crewmen. President Lyndon Johnson subsequently blocked an investigation into what had occurred, a cover-up that has persisted to this day.
– In 1987, Jonathan Pollard, the most damaging spy in the history of the United States, was convicted of carrying out espionage for Israel. He is up for parole next year. 
– And Israel gets away with literally and directly killing individual American citizens in the cases of Rachel Corrie in 2003 and Furkan Dogan of the Mavi Marmara in 2010.
“Israelophobia,” on the other hand, is steeped in centuries of
anti-Semitic stereotypes, but it has now taken on an intense life of its own, often rich in contemporary fabrications — for example, that historically Jews have never lived in Jerusalem; that IDF soldiers harvest the organs of Palestinians; that the “wall of separation,” built to keep out terrorists, is a form of apartheid — and through these falsehoods gushes forth a hatred for Jews. Israelophobia is a block of hatred crystallized around a piece of land, around an idea. Anti-Zionism today, from Malmö to Qom, arises and multiplies entirely from prejudice against Israel: many of its most vicious critics have never even set foot in the state.
These attacks on Israel are all too often made up of devastating classical anti-Semitic projections, lies and distortions to delegitimize Israel — the blood libel that Jews kill non-Jewish children to use their blood to bake matzah; bottomless greed; indifference, and savage cruelty toward anyone who is not Jewish. Even legitimate geopolitical decisions — such as the right to self-defense, or not being expected to hold territory in perpetuity until such time as one’s sworn enemies might perhaps decide not to threaten annihilation, with no cost for the delay; or ignoring other countries accused of “occupation,” such as Turkey in Cyprus, Pakistan in Kashmir or China in Tibet, while singling out only Israel for opprobrium. These accusations are often translated not just into judgments against Israel, but then go viral against any Jew.

In modern society, technology has become instrumental in people’s daily routines, from the proliferation of smart phones to Wi-Fi on laptops and other devices. This new wave of technology is meant to enhance lives. But with the emergence of self-driving cars, first produced by the likes of Google and now sought by Mercedes-Benz, the ability to physically drive might become antiquated. This next technological advancement might be going too far and ignores many economic ramifications.
Viola He | Daily Trojan
Today, nearly 3.5 million people work as truck drivers in America alone. If self-driving cars come to fruition, the need for trucking drivers will be completely eradicated. Instead of drivers working, a robotic car will be able to complete their jobs for them. Though those 3.5 million workers could eventually go into other trades, most will end up unemployed, earning a small stipend from the government’s unemployment program to keep them in financially stable conditions. The government simply cannot afford for those 3.5 million workers to join the unemployed and ultimately put our nation into more debt.
Additionally, taxi drivers and other related car services rely on their driving skills to earn a living. With the invention of self-driving cars, people will be able to rent a vehicle that will drive them to their destination instead of completing a personable transaction. More people will be out of work and join a government-paid program. With too many people out of work, the nation might not be able to continue paying for the unemployed, increasing homelessness rates.
Because no one will actually be operating self-driving vehicles, there will be less of a need for car insurance and automotive lawyers. People will no longer feel the need to take precautions, as they will feel protected by the self-operating car. Computers like the ones implemented in these cars are not always reliable and could crash at any given time. A computer crash could result in a major collision that could not be stopped with the simple push of the brake pedal. Furthermore, self-driving cars could be disrupted by weather conditions such as rain and snow, which could cause interference with the camera and sensor. Not only could passengers end up injured, but these accidents could also result in financial woes. Without the need for car insurance and the inevitable elimination of automotive lawyers, the passenger would be burdened with the financial repercussions.
Lastly, the purchase of one of these coveted vehicles will be nearly impossible for the average American. Today, cars are staples in the average American household. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, the average American spends $30,000 on a new vehicle, and even less on used cars. Buyers will not be able to find a self-driving car at anywhere near this price range. In 2025, self-driving vehicles will be about $10,000 more expensive than a standard car. Additionally, since only luxury brands are beginning to produce prototypes, the cars will not be affordable for the average consumer. Without any affordable options, self-driving cars may become exclusive to the wealthy.
Despite the many benefits of self-driving cars, they simply cannot be a reality. The economic reality proves that self-driving cars are detrimental to the nation, auto companies and consumers. The United States and its people cannot afford this luxury, regardless of the perks.
hmmm…this article makes sense…computers may crash or need repair…or the motherboard may need to be replaced…and i cannot afford 1…i thought about saving $$$…i am DISABLED from a HEAD-ON CA CRASH a long time ago…it wouldtake a very long time to save $30,000!  What about an ELIO?  $6800…I will get an ELIO!
I’m so sick of these “ROBOTS ARE GONNA TAKE OUR JOBS” articles. Advancements in our history have always resulted in a learning curve for workers. Notice you don’t see many apothecaries around these days? How about blacksmiths, typewriter repairmen, or asbestos installers? The value of an employee is their ability to learn new skills when required. Taxi drivers who are electrically inclined can take classes and get certified to install/repair navigation equipment. Those who aren’t can pick another field. This cycle has been going on forever, and is very sustainable.
“The economic reality proves that self-driving cars are detrimental to the nation, auto companies and consumers.” Are you F’ing crazy? You didn’t prove anything, cite any sources, or do any research. You state your opinions as facts, when you have none. When irresponsible reporting on the internet becomes obsolete by people thinking for themselves, I hope you are flexible enough to learn a skill. This drivel is straight up nonesencse.

The Neuroscience graduate program held their annual symposium, a day-long event that featured four student speakers and 90 poster presentations from all graduate students in the program at the Radisson hotel at USC on Wednesday.
The student speakers addressed USC graduate school faculty and students on topics ranging from steroid abuse, itch treatments and Alzheimer’s disease.
The symposium began with various graduate student lectures. Third-year graduate student Kathryn Wallin kicked off the lecture portion of the symposium with her research on the effects of anabolic steroids on the behaviorial and functional structures within the brain
Wallin’s research included the study of rats to analyze effects of steroid abuse on the human brain. Wallin explained that rats treated with testosterone were more motivated to obtain food rewards than were non-treated rats when faced with the need of increased efforts. Additionally, treated rats were found to have brain damage.
Matthew Ellis, a first-year graduate student, presented a summary of his research on the feasibility of monitoring and predicting Alzheimer’s progression. Ellis conducted research by peering through the human eye and observing molecular changes in the retina.
Ellis discussed that studying the eye requires additional technology to measure molecular changes.
“You can see into the eye with great resolution. However, if you want to see the molecular changes occurring, what we really need are probes that hint as to what might be going on,” Ellis said.
The closing lecture featured Dr. Anders Dale, professor of neuroscience and radiology at University of California, San Diego. Dale is recognized by the scientific community for developing imaging techniques to understand disease. He has also developed models of the human brain and is the author of several publications.
Dale presented the lecture, which included an explanation of methods for analyzing specific regions along the genome to identify gene loci that would normally be difficult to find.
Dale’s method includes the use of regulatory genes to discover genetic clusters associated with polygenic traits. These polygenic traits have led to increased power to predict variants in genetic loci associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The method allows researchers to identify three times the gene loci than would be possible through standard methods.
Followed by Dale’s lecture was the presentation of the student of the year award, awarded to David Clewett, a student with multiple publications.
All students were required to present their work, so the symposium reflected research at various stages, ranging from under six months to four or five years. Ventura said the event presents only a “snapshot of where students are at with their research,” and students must grapple with both  public speaking fears and having “to balance getting people to understand [their work] and also being specific and very scientific.”
The neuroscience department has been hosting symposiums since 2005 to afford students the opportunity to strengthen their science communication abilities, according to Judith Hirsch, associate director of the graduate program. Christopher Ventura, student speaker coordinator, said that students must overcome communication obstacles in explaining very specific research to students of different backgrounds.
“Most of them come from very different backgrounds,” Ventura said. “So they kind of have to talk to a general science audience about a very specific project and have everyone understand it.”

USC hosted the Veritas Forum discussion yesterday night in Town and Gown. This year’s forum, “Neighbors: A Campus Conversation on Race, Empathy and Faith,” featured guest speakers, Dr. Jody Armour of the Gould Law School and visiting speaker William Tate, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis.
Veritas Forums are hosted by campus student organizations across 70 campuses nationwide. The forums aim to engage students and faculty members in a dialogue about life’s hardest questions in the context of both faith and Jesus Christ.
Though Veritas is a Christian organization, it explores how an individual’s faith might affect their perception on various academic topics.
“Many of the students who attend are not Christian,” Varun Soni, dean of religious life at USC, said. “This year’s theme of racial justice and empathy is an important national conversation for all of us to have regardless of our individual faith affiliations.”
Typically, Veritas Forums aims to foster academic discussions between one professor who identifies as a Christian and one professor who does not.
The Forum invites a diverse group of students who are Christian and non-Christian.  Non-Christian groups on campuses are often invited to present the first questions during the Q&A portion of the talks as well as supply additional reading materials for the presenters.
Laura Ziesel, West Coast regional director of the Veritas Forum, explained why she believes Veritas is an important component for college students.
“We are convinced that these conversations are important to the well-being of students, and that knowing how to have hard conversations in the face of significant differences is a culture-changing skill,” Ziesel said.
Each year, student planning teams and presenters work together to decide the discussion’s theme.  This year, USC undergraduate students Saharra Griffin and Rachel Victor, as well as graduate students Magadalene Ante Christian Brown and Abigail Jia Er Kang decided the theme for Veritas.
In an opening speech, Soni discussed the timeliness of the Verita’s topics for discussion.
“Given the recent events in Ferguson and the release of the film Selma, this is a timely conversation for all of us to have, but the reality is that a conversation about racial justice in the United States has always been a timely conversation since the birth of our nation,” Soni said.
Questions regarding religious discourse among the black community included the opinion of prominent black female rapper, Azealia Banks, who has compared “black Christians to “Uncle Toms.”
Armour asked Tate about [the harmed groups whatever they are]’s relationship with the Bible.
“Why should someone from one of these harmed groups find comfort and solace and salvation in this Book [the Bible]?,” Armour said.
Tate responded that the issue largely came down to the historical context in the Bible.
Furthermore, he contended that the Bible does not identify slavery as a widespread issue but was something acquired in the United States during the 17th, 18th and 19th century.  This being said, the scripture was inaccurately used to defend injustice all across the United States.
Dean Soni presented the final portion of the forum by asking both presenters to speak directly to the students about ways in which they can think about and practice empathy.
The Veritas Forum closed with a benediction by civil rights activist the Rev. Cecil Murray of the USC Cecil Murray Center for Community Engagement.

USC recently passed the $4 billion threshold in its $6 billion fundraising campaign, a feat achieved only by five universities in history.
The campaign, known as The Campaign for USC and spearheaded by President C. L. Max Nikias, has a goal to raise $6 billion by June 2018. With Nikias at the helm, USC has raised the $4 billion in just four and a half years.
“I share this news with great pride and gratitude, as it represents the collective efforts and dedication of the entire Trojan Family,” Nikias said in a letter to the USC community. “With gifts coming from every corner of the world, and every constituent group in our community.”
According to Nikias, his main goal in raising the funds is to improve academics at the university. $1.4 billion of the $4 billion has been allocated to the university endowment, which helps increase student financial aid and scholarships.
“In the last four and a half years alone, this endowment has allowed us to create 77 new faculty chairs,” Nikias said. “In addition, of the money raised, $2.1 billion has advanced other academic priorities, comprising faculty research programs, research institutes, school-based programs, and the medical enterprise, including pediatric research and care.”
Nikias also noted that 2014 broke records for USC Athletics, raising an unprecedented $280 million despite the end of the NCAA sanctions this year.
Despite the achievements in fundraising, Nikias stressed the importance of continuing the momentum.
“I must emphasize that now is not the time to become complacent,” Nikias said in the letter. “We still have $2 billion left to raise, and the final stretch of any campaign is always the most difficult.”
USC has also maintained its ranking as third in fundraising among American universities, behind Harvard University and Stanford University, according to the survey done by the Council for Aid to Education.
The university raised $732 million in 2014, Stanford — last year’s top fundraiser — raised $928.4 million — and Harvard — last year’s runner-up for top fundraiser — raised $1.16 billion.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics kicked off its first Students Talk Back event for the spring semester in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday afternoon.
The discussion, “Raising the Bar for California Schools: Teacher Evaluations and Student Testing,” focused on policy discourse that could potentially improve the future of the California educational system.
The panel featured Beth Shuster, education editor for the Los Angeles Times; Mike Stryer, vice president of district and union policy for Teach Plus, one of the nation’s largest teacher voice organizations; Jacob Ellenhorn, director of public relations of USC College Republicans; and Kevin Sanchez; former K-12 executive aide of Harlem Children’s Zone.
Co-moderators included Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute, and Danni Wang, editorial director of the Daily Trojan.
Schnur fostered discourse among panelists and audience members when he discussed the results for the 2012 Vergara decision. Vergara v. California, is a closed case that included nine public school students who filed a suit against inconsistencies found among California statutes with regard to the educational system. The decision was reached in August 2014 when Judge Rolf M. Treu of the California Superior Court found the evidence to be unconstitutional. Shortly after, the ruling was appealed by California Gov. Jerry Brown.
Stryer discussed how the case produced two opposing groups.
“To me it is a very misunderstood ruling. You saw both sides saying either, ‘This is great because it is ending tenure, use of seniority and due process.’ [And others] saying, ‘Isn’t this terrible? It ends these hard fought protections that are absolutely vital,’” Stryer said.
Wang asked Stryer to explain the recently released Teach Plus poll results, which covered issues such as teacher tenure, layoffs and dismissal.
“At Teach Plus, we are a teacher voice organization really looking to amplify the voice of teachers and policy issues,” he said. “What we set out to do was to really look at what are the views of California teachers around these critical issues.”
Recently, Teach Plus took part in an independent polling study which gathered results from 506 teachers in California to understand issues that directly affect them.
According to Stryer, the poll found that teachers highly valued tenure, but felt it should be an earned professional benchmark. Teachers also believed that classroom performance should be part of layoff decisions when layoffs are necessary, that their struggling colleagues should be better supported. Teachers identified themselves as passionate about having a strong voice in policy development and implementation.
Shuster expressed her concern toward teachers who are unable to express their voice to the community.
“I think what happens sometimes is that the teachers’ union people who have a very strong point of view get their message out and a group like Mike’s teachers that are representing classroom teachers don’t often get their voices out,” Shuster said.
Schnur opened the discussion for school choice and privatization.
“Whether you are talking private schools or school vouchers, there is no shortage of proposals in the mix about how to decide where a person ought to go to school and who ought to make that decision,” Schnur said.
Ellenhorn commented on California’s current educational system.
“What we are looking at right now is a government-run system that basically sets up a monopoly on where you have to send your children — you don’t have a choice,” Ellenhorn said. “If you live in a bad neighborhood, and you can’t afford to go anywhere else, you are stuck at that school.”
Sanchez discussed why increased high school graduation rates cannot account for a more able generation of students moving to the workforce.
“In late April 2014 the state’s superintendent office released a news report stating that California‘s graduation rate was the highest it’s ever been at 80.2 percent and LAUSD had a graduate  rate of 67.9 percent but given that California’s graduation rate is so high, I think it’s interesting to think about what that means … I’m not sure if anyone in this room can say we are doing a fantastic job as a state,” Sanchez said.
Shuster ended the discussion by posing a question to Stryer.
“Should teachers get paid more to work in these schools?” Shuster asked.
“I think that there is a myth out there that our strongest teachers don’t want to teach in the lowest performing schools because it is difficult. That is simply not true,” Stryer said. “When strong teachers are given the support and the opportunities to succeed they absolutely will go into those schools.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Mike Stryer is the executive director of Teach Plus, one of the nation’s largest teacher’s unions. He is actually the vice president of district and union policy for Teach Plus, one of the nation’s largest teacher voice organizations. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Undergraduate Student Government hosted a SpeakSC Forum on Wednesday night that centered on the annual fountain run tradition that many undergraduate seniors partake in.
USG President Andrew Menard, moderated the forum. Administrators in attendance included Dr. Ainsley Carry, vice provost for Student Affairs; Dr. Monique Allard, assistant provost for Student Affairs; and Lieutenant Hecklemann of the Dept. of Public Safety.
For the last decade, seniors have attempted to run into all of the fountains located on the University Park campus. The annual fountain run, which occurs on the last Thursday before graduation, has sparked great concern among school officials due to the damage caused by last year’s event.
Last year, three students were transported to a local hospital due to injuries or intoxication. The 2014 fountain run cost the university $34,842 in damages. Though DPS wrapped parts of the fountains in specialized fencing to prevent damage and student injury, nearly all of the fences were torn down in under eight minutes.
Youth Triumphant, a fountain located at the center of Alumni Park and features a solid bronze statue atop four “modest maidens,” incurred the most financial and physical damage.
Menard commented on the importance of smoothly facilitating this year’s fountain run.
“Administrators reached out to USG and said, ‘Look, these are the damages we’ve incurred, this is the amount of lacerations there have been, this is the amount of students that were transported to the hospital, and we need to have a conversation about liability and safety,’” Menard said. “USG wanted students to have a place in this discussion so we decided to put together an event where we can get administrators and students in the same room talking about solutions.”
Students and administrators reached a consensus agreeing that the fountain run must change in order to ensure student safety. Others also expressed their desire to effectively communicate about the event in order to preserve the fountain tradition.
Carry asked students to work with administrators to help achieve a smoother, safer event.
“We need your help for coming up with a smarter way to make this a safe event,” Carry said. “The fountain run was born out of the students. You have a chance to stake a claim in what is acceptable at your institution.”
Students in attendance also contributed their ideas to the administration. One senior suggested selling tickets to contribute to the possible damages incurred during the event and to prevent outsiders from participating. Another student suggested checking student identification for this purpose. Many students supported the idea of an alternative event, however, such as food trucks or a concert, running concurrently with the fountain run to direct traffic away from the fountains.
Lieutenant Hecklemenn asserted that the fountains be excluded from any kind of alternative event. Other administrators agreed with this sentiment.
“An alternative event is an excellent idea, but it would have to exclude the fountains,” Hecklemenn said. “The fountains are simply not designed for this kind of event. That’s the challenge.”
Suggestions to end the fountain run for the 2015 school year was met by hesitation from students. Many felt the cancellation of the highly anticipated event would not stop seniors from continuing to partake in the fountain run.
Rini Sampath, vice president of USG, said cancelling the fountain run might not be effective.
“Cancellation of the fountain run might create an issue where students are organizing it for a day where DPS isn’t aware,” Sampath said. “So if we were going to organize something else I think it would need to coexist with the fountain run.”
