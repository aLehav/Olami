After a disappointing start in Pac-10 play, the No. 16 USC women’s volleyball team rebounded in the second half of the year to finish fifth in the country’s toughest conference, and will host Oklahoma in the first round of the 2009 NCAA Women’s Volleyball Tournament.
The bracket, announced Sunday afternoon, pits the Women of Troy (21-9) against the Sooners (18-11) Friday evening at the Galen Center. If USC wins, it will host either No. 12 Hawaii (27-2) or New Mexico (20-9) in the second round of the tournament on Saturday.

USC coach Mick Haley said he knew his team was going to face tough opponents early in the tournament and feels fortunate that the NCAA committee chose his team to host the first two rounds. The Women of Troy have only lost two matches at home all season.
“We get to host, and that’s a really good thing,” Haley said. “We’ll take it one team at a time. Right now, the focus is on Oklahoma.”
USC defeated the Sooners, 3-1, in an early season tournament in 2008.
The Women of Troy are riding a six-match winning streak heading into the tournament. The team’s most recent two wins were against Arizona State and No. 19 Arizona this weekend at the Galen Center.
Led by the inspired play of All-American senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin on Senior Day, the Women of Troy defeated the Arizona Wildcats, 3-1 (23-25, 25-22, 36-34, 25-23), in a tight conference match to end the season.
Gysin had a career-high 23 kills and 16 digs to help lead her team to victory. Haley said he was proud of the way the sixth-year senior ended her season and said Gysin has been a captain who has led by example all year long.
“She’s constantly giving everybody encouragement,” Haley said. “It’s hard not to come in here and play hard when you see your captains playing hard everyday. That kind of culture breeds success in the matches.”
Haley also said he was very impressed by the way Gysin stepped up in the close match Saturday against the Wildcats.
“The other team did about everything they could to try to stop her and still couldn’t. Hopefully, there’s more left in the tank,” he said.
Senior captain libero Alli Hillgren recorded 34 digs — two off her career best —­ in the victory. Sophomore setter Kendall Bateman recorded career-highs with 62 assists and 15 digs. Sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter had 23 kills with 13 digs, while sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams had 12 kills against one error.
Outside hitter Tiffany Owens led Arizona (19-10, 8-10) with 22 kills and 14 digs, while outside hitter Whitney Dosty had 20 kills and 10 digs with four block assists. Setter Paige Weber posted 59 assists for the Wildcats.
With the match tied 1-1, USC won a draining third set 36-34 when Jupiter slammed two kills to finally put Arizona away. Riding the momentum, the Women of Troy closed the door on the Wildcats in the fourth set to finish their season on a high note.
“It was really close the whole way,” Haley said. “You can’t have a better finishing match and come out on top than that.”
USC also defeated Arizona State on Friday night, 3-1 (25-16, 25-16, 22-25, 25-18), behind the strong play of Jupiter, who posted 25 kills, 15 digs and hit .340 in the match.
Bateman tallied 59 assists with two kills and eight digs. Williams finished with 14 kills and four block assists, while Gysin had 15 kills and 10 digs. Junior Audrey Eichler had nine kills without an error and six blocks (three solo).
Outside hitter Sarah Reaves led Arizona State (13-16, 3-14) with 16 kills and 11 digs. Outside hitter Camri Zweisler had eight kills in two sets, while outside hitter Sofie Schlagintweit and middle blocker Erica Wilson had seven kills each for the Sun Devils.

If the USC men’s basketball team’s first test of the season was Sunday’s game against Nebraska, then the players and coaches probably were not content with their grade.
The Trojans struggled to find an offensive rhythm throughout the game and missed altogether when senior forward Marcus Johnson airballed a 3-pointer as time expired in USC’s 51-48 loss at the Galen Center.
Nebraska guard Eshaunte Jones gave the Cornhuskers the final edge in the tightly contested game when the redshirt freshman’s 3-pointer broke the tie with 11.7 seconds left.
The Trojans (2-2) led late but saw Nebraska cut the deficit, courtesy of senior guard Ryan Anderson, who had 14 points.
Redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson led USC with 13 points and 12 rebounds. Senior guard Dwight Lewis had 10 points, but only shot 2-of-9 from the field.
Despite holding a 38-27 rebounding advantage over the Huskers, the Trojans were haunted by poor shooting and turnovers. USC only made 38.5 percent of its shots from the field and gave the ball away 17 times.
The Trojans also struggled at the line, converting just 13 of their 24 free-throw attempts.
Sunday’s loss marked the end of USC’s four-game homestand to start the season. The Trojans will hit the road next to face No. 2 Texas on Thursday and No. 23 Georgia Tech on Saturday.

The late-game hype surrounding the USC-UCLA game overshadowed the strongest defensive effort the Trojans have put up in weeks.
No. 18 USC forced four turnovers against its cross-town rival on Saturday, highlighted by junior linebacker Malcom Smith’s first quarter interception that was returned 62 yards for a touchdown. Smith was honored on Monday as both the Pac-10 and National Defensive Player of the Week.

Redshirt senior safety Will Harris and redshirt senior cornerback Josh Pinkard also intercepted passes as USC’s defense returned to dominating form and shut down the Bruins for the better part of the game.
USC coach Pete Carroll was so confident in his defense that he didn’t mind punting the ball away when his offense failed to get the job done, which happened often during Saturday’s contest.
“If you notice, there were a number of times on third and long, we didn’t take the chance on going down the field,” Carroll said after practice Monday. “In that mode, we were thinking pretty conservatively and thinking follow what we play on defense as long as we could. In years past, it’s been very similar in [the UCLA] game.”
The Trojans’ defense appeared far more effective than it had in recent weeks, most notably in lopsided losses to Oregon and Stanford. Freshman defensive end Devon Kennard said the turnovers helped spark the team’s dominating performance Saturday.
“We spent the two weeks really concentrating on getting prepared for the game and getting mentally ready,” Kennard said Monday. “I feel like we came out there all flowing together and playing well as a defense and as a team.”
Despite the offense’s inability to move the ball most of the game, Carroll said he was impressed with the way offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates ran the attack and blamed the offense’s ineffectiveness more on the Bruins’ solid defense and Trojans’ penalties than the team’s play-calling.
One play call has still managed to stick in the minds of many — freshman quarterback Matt Barkley’s 48-yard touchdown pass to redshirt junior Damian Williams with under a minute remaining that sparked tensions between the Bruins and Trojans. Two days later, Carroll was still hearing opinions about the play.
“I think there’s a certain amount of response to it, but I don’t think it’s anything out of what you would imagine would happen,” Carroll said.
u
The Trojans were not able to avoid injuries during their win Saturday. Senior special teams specialist Garrett Green tore his ACL and junior running back Joe McKnight bruised his left quad in the second half and did not return to the field.
Upon hearing about Green’s injury, Carroll said Monday that he was crushed that his senior’s career would end in such a way and explained how important he thought Green was to the younger players around him.
“He’s been a great leader over the years, particularly this year,” Carroll said. “I really hate that that happened to him because he was really contributing in so many ways and was such a great example for the young guys of how you can find a way to help the football team win.”
McKnight said he had to take himself out of the game because he couldn’t run any longer. He hopes to practice Tuesday.
“I’ll try to run around a little bit and get back my full range of motion and try to work until Saturday,” he said.
u
After practice, Carroll shared his thoughts on the dismissal of Notre Dame’s head coach Charlie Weis. During his five-year tenure at Notre Dame, Weis led the team to a disappointing 35-27 record, including a 6-6 season that ended in four straight losses this year.
“Charlie made a good run at it there. It didn’t go the way he wanted it to,” Carroll said. “It’s a very difficult place to coach, and the expectations are extraordinary, and it didn’t quite work out. But he gave everything he had and busted it out.”

Despite all of the comeback victories and the overtime wins that the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team had experienced this season, the Trojans’ playoff hopes still rested in the outcome of one final game at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
After falling to No. 4 UCLA 10-6 in the semifinal round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships, the Trojans bested No. 2 Stanford 9-7 in a must-win game to take third place in the tournament and earn the solo at-large bid to the NCAA Championships in Princeton, NJ.

“I’m just ecstatic,” said junior driver Devon Borisoff, who had a goal for the Trojans. “It was an unbelievable victory and a huge game in our home pool.”
Leading USC were senior driver Matt Sagehorn and senior two-meters Jordan Thompson and J.W. Krumpholz, who each notched two goals in the win. Borisoff, along with senior driver Justin Rappel and sophomore two-meter Matt Burton, rounded out the scoring with a goal apiece.
“We knew that this could be our last game of the year, so we came out and put it all on the line,” Sagehorn said.
The game did not start in the Trojans’ favor, however, as the Cardinals were quick to take a 2-0 lead in the first period.
“Burton comes up and was like, ‘That doesn’t matter, we went down 2-0 on them at the NCAAs last year and came back and won 7-5,’” Sagehorn said. “And that kind of led everyone to think that it doesn’t matter if you go down; if you play the whole game … you’re going to be able to come back in the end.”
And the Trojans did just that.
USC surged back with five straight goals — four of which came in the second period behind the arms of Krumpholz and Thompson — to take a 5-2 advantage into the half. Despite offensive scoring spurts from Stanford, goals from Borisoff, Sagehorn and Kurzeka allowed USC to maintain its lead for the rest of the match and seal the 9-7 victory.
“We hit our shots and we passed the ball to our big guys,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “[Krumpholz] had two goals, [Thompson] had two goals. We gave them the ball, and that’s tough to stop.”
The win allowed the Trojans to place in the tournament despite a semifinal loss to rival UCLA on Saturday.
Senior driver Shea Buckner had three scores against the Bruins, but the Trojans could not keep up with UCLA’s offensive attack, which netted three goals in the fourth period to put the game out of reach and dash USC’s hopes for a third-consecutive MPSF title. UCLA would go on to win the tournament and capture the automatic bid into the NCAA Championships.
To reach the semifinals, the Trojans came out strong in a 13-5 victory over No. 8 Pacific on Friday, where Buckner again led USC with a career-high five scores. His first of the game was also the 100th goal of his career, making him one of 25 Trojans to reach that benchmark.

Talk about a switcheroo.
The first 59 minutes of USC and UCLA’s annual cross-town battle Saturday qualified as a certifiable snoozer.
Setting the tone · Junior linebacker Malcolm Smith got USC on the board by returning an interception 62 yards for a score. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
But boy did the sparks fly in the final seconds, when UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel called a timeout as USC attempted to run the clock out on a would-be 14-point victory.
That was all the provoking USC coach Pete Carroll needed. On the next play he called on freshman quarterback Matt Barkley to deliver a 48-yard touchdown strike to junior receiver Damian Williams to break open the game.
That gave the Trojans the 28-7 win in front of a decidedly quiet crowd of 85,713 at the Coliseum, but it also brought almost the entire UCLA sideline onto the field in what almost ended up in a brawl.
“That was just competing,” Carroll said in his postgame press conference.
Neuheisel said he didn’t blame Carroll for the decision to run a play-action pass with the Trojans up by 14 in the final minute.
Still, his players expressed surprise at the call that mirrored Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh’s choice to go for the two-point conversion two weeks ago against the Trojans.
“I was speechless,” sophomore safety Rahim Moore said. “They caught us off guard.”
That last minute demanded most of the postgame attention, but for much of the game, junior linebacker Malcolm Smith was the story.
He picked off a Kevin Prince pass in the first quarter and took it back 62 yards for a touchdown, providing the Trojans their only points of the first half.
Smith, who has missed three games this season because of a shoulder ailment, was also credited with 15 tackles in the game, a career-high.
“He was finally himself,” said redshirt sophomore middle linebacker Chris Galippo. “All year he’s been hindered by a few injuries and this and that, but this is the one game that everybody got to see the real Malcolm Smith.”
Daily Trojan | Geo Tu
Smith also stuffed three UCLA plays for a loss.
“He was all over the field,” Carroll said. “He played a beautiful game.”
As a whole, the Trojan defense held the Bruins scoreless until late in the fourth quarter, rattling both UCLA quarterbacks all game long. Redshirt freshman Kevin Prince and senior Kevin Craft combined to complete 18-of-39 passes for no touchdowns and three interceptions.
“We made too many mistakes, particularly on offense,” Neuheisel said.
It was a performance not seen from the USC defense in recent weeks. In their last five games prior to Saturday, the Trojans had given up an average of nearly 35 points per game.
“Defensively, it was huge to keep the score down,” Carroll said. “We were able to adjust and keep things in order.”
UCLA’s first — and only — score came with less than six minutes remaining in the game on a direct-snap two-yard run by senior running back Chane Moline.
That made the score 14-7, putting the Bruins in position to make a final push to tie the score.
But USC responded with a methodical nine-play drive capped by a two-yard touchdown run by redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford, using up more than four minutes of clock.
Bradford ran four times for 30 yards on the drive — for a total of 62 yards on 14 carries in the game — and served as a decoy on multiple Barkley passes.
“We threw it when we had to and we used a little play-action here and there,” Barkley said. “When it counts, those are the big drives that you really need.”
For the much-maligned USC offense, the possession was a bright spot.
“I was really proud of the offense — that was their best drive of the day,” said offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates. “And we needed it. We had to take it down and get some points.”
And so the 79th meeting between the two teams ended exactly like last year’s, with the Trojans on top by a score of 28-7.
There will be no Rose Bowl for either Los Angeles school, but in what has amounted to a mediocre season for both, USC can again go home with bragging rights.
“It’s always good to beat UCLA,” Bradford said. “They play us tough every year regardless of whether they’re ranked or they’re not or what’s going in the season or how bad their record is or how bad our record is.”
Compared to other in-state rivalries across the nation, the so-called battle for LA has lacked in bravado since UCLA’s 13-9 upset over the Trojans in 2006. But the late-game antics this time around might have created something to look forward to next year.
“It was good to see a little controversy, I guess you could say,” Galippo said. “Every other rivalry in the nation is like that, and it was good to see that here.”

After a slow start to the season, the USC women’s basketball team rebounded with a pair of impressive victories over the holiday break.
The Women of Troy (3-3) finished second in their division at the Paradise Jam tournament in the US Virgin Islands and sophomore guard Ashley Corral was named to the All-Tournament team.
A 66-51 loss to Rutgers in the opening game of the tournament dropped USC to 1-3 on the season with two games against ranked opponents on the horizon. Despite the grim prospects, the Women of Troy rose to the occasion with wins over No. 13 Texas and No. 19 Mississippi State.
The victories moved USC to .500 on the season and, more importantly, gave them three wins over teams that made the NCAA tournament last season.
The catalyst for the turnaround was defense. Before the season began, USC coach Michael Cooper spoke at length about wanting his team to play tenacious defense. He got his wish in the final two games of the tournament. The Women of Troy harassed both Texas (4-2) and Mississippi State (4-3) into poor shooting nights.
Defense alone was almost not enough on Saturday against Mississippi State. Despite holding the high-scoring Bulldogs to 35 percent shooting, USC went without a field goal over the final 8:41 minutes of the game and allowed Mississippi State to creep back.
Twice the Bulldogs cut the lead to two points in the final minute, but clutch free throws by sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath and Corral allowed the Women of Troy to hang on for the 64-60 victory.
USC also got big contributions off the bench. The Women of Troy enjoyed a 20-6 advantage in bench points, led by seniors Aarika Hughes and Daniela Roark. Hughes paced USC with 14 points and three steals while Roark knocked down back-to-back threes to put her team up by five points.
A balanced offensive attack helped USC to victory against Texas. Four different players scored in double figures for the Women of Troy, led by Gilbreath’s 13 points. Hughes and junior center Kari LaPlante added 12 points apiece for USC.
The Women of Troy held Texas to just 28 percent shooting for the game. USC broke open a close game in the second half behind some hot shooting from LaPlante, who scored 10 of her 12 points after halftime.
Texas clawed back into the game late behind solid 3-point shooting. Junior Kathleen Nash knocked down her fourth 3-pointer to draw her team within four points late in the game, but the Women of Troy held on and won 61-54.
Senior guard Heather Oliver added 10 points for USC.
The Women of Troy struggled in their first game of the tournament against Rutgers. USC shot just 25 percent from the field in a blowout loss to the Scarlet Knights, 66-51.
Rutgers overcame a game-high 24 points from Corral.

This one was ugly to the end.
Maybe it’s for the best that this showing was relegated to cable in a timeslot that would keep anyone on the East Coast from watching. Those who did tune in probably flipped the channel before the conclusion.
Holding back · Referees hold back upset UCLA players, who were angered after USC threw a long touchdown pass in the final minute. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Experiencing Saturday’s USC-UCLA game was as much of a struggle as the one that took place on the field. Stats could tell the story: The Trojans racked up more than 100 penalty yards and the Bruins turned the ball over four times.
But all except for the last minute of this game will likely be forgotten. And it’s not just that the surprise strike to junior receiver Damian Williams and the ensuing skirmish finally gave us something to talk about. It’s that the two most memorable moments of the night embodied the pulse of the rivalry and captured where both programs stand.
It’s just a shame that the rivalry manifested itself in such a hideous way.
Some have said that USC’s 48-yard touchdown pass with 44 seconds left and the Trojans up 21-7 was the football equivalent of a middle finger to a despised rival. The move won’t be remembered for its social tact, but fans have cried that the Trojans were provoked. USC was content to run out the clock on an otherwise forgettable game, but the opportunity for another touchdown arose when the Bruins used a timeout to get the ball back.
“We’re not trying to run the score up,” redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford said. “We have respect for UCLA, and they have respect for us. But we were trying to run the game clock out and they called a timeout, so I guess they wanted some more.”
As expected, USC coach Pete Carroll had a politically correct take on the play already crafted for the postgame press conference.
“It’s the heart of a competitor just battling,” Carroll said. “In the competitive moment, we went for it — and that’s it.”
There’s little doubt that competitive energy drove the decision, but don’t believe both parties when they spin this just as a matter of trying to win a football game.
No, there was plenty of ego involved in this. Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley spoke after the game about being disrespected by the Bruins’ decision to take a timeout. It was clear that damaged feelings were a key component of the escalation.
Carroll and UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel are perhaps too similar to be cordial while sharing the same field. The combative nature of their relationship is well-documented, and it’s clear that there’s bitterness simmering beneath the surface on both sides. The postgame handshake between the two was as icy as was the rest of the night at the Coliseum.
Maybe we should have seen all of this coming. By taking a timeout, Neuheisel opened himself up to the possibility of being lit up one last time. But the long bomb and subsequent celebration gave the Trojans an unbecoming aura of showiness.
Players shrugged off the incident afterward, saying that there was never a chance of a fight breaking out. And maybe the best part of the whole debacle was that a full-on melee never broke out.
“We jumped around a little bit, and then we saw them coming over,” said redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo, who avoided the potential skirmish by standing on the sidelines. “I just said, ‘No one’s going to see me on YouTube getting knocked out.’ That was kind of on my mind, but I also didn’t want anything to jeopardize next week’s game.”
There’s little use in playing the blame game now. When viewed in isolation, both coaches’ choices seem innocuous. But somewhere along the line, cooler heads should have prevailed and one coach should have yielded in the name of sportsmanship.
Both coaches gush about the rivalry and its history. Yet instead of a memorable game, the lasting image of this game might be UCLA’s redshirt senior linebacker Reggie Carter knocking down an official in the post-touchdown fracas. Vitriol and animosity won out on Saturday, and will reign until the next clash.
The good news for both sides is that they’ll get another chance at this next year.

In comedy, the rule of three proposes that things become funnier if they occur three times. After two successive gags involving golf balls to the groin, one can only wonder if a third would have made any difference.
Old Dogs, which opened Nov. 25, fails to learn any new tricks.
Father figure · In Old Dogs, John Travolta stars as a businessman who must learn the ways of parenting when forced to babysit 7-year-old twins. - Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Studios
The film centers upon Dan (Robin Williams) and Charlie (John Travolta), two middle-aged businessmen whose self-centered and slightly homoerotic existence is disturbed when Dan’s jailbird ex-wife saddles them with a pair of 7-year-old twins.
Accompanied by their diminutive co-worker Ralph (Seth Green), Dan and Charlie embark on a series of ill-conceived adventures aimed at giving Dan’s children a proper childhood. Hilarity does not ensue. Dan then faces the difficult choice between moving to Tokyo for work and remaining with his children to complete the “Dad List” written by his son.
Old Dogs struggles with tone from beginning to end, often wandering into absurd tangents that border on being distasteful. Travolta’s Charlie ruins a memorial service for a grandmother after a mix-up involving prescription pills, yet later we are expected to pine for the loss of his dog, laid to rest at decadent funeral.
The exorbitant displays of wealth in this film are cringe-inducing (who has money for a dog hotel these days?) and sure to strike the average moviegoer as gratuitous and hopelessly out of touch. After a year when most families took some kind of financial hit, the last people they’re about to sympathize with would be a couple of executives with lavish apartments and jet-setting lifestyles.
Although the audience is spared an appearance by Dakota Fanning, the child actors in Old Dogs are nevertheless thoroughly unlikable and tedious. Green — the next closest thing to a child actor — tries his best to inject the family dynamic with a modicum of likeability, but his strongest moments can be viewed for free in the movie trailer.
The film reaches for the heartstrings as Dan tries to reconnect with the children he could do without, but fails because of excessive blunders and distracting special effects. One electrode to the genitals later, the only genuine emotion is the lingering sadness that this was Bernie Mac’s last film. Mac’s minor role as entertainer Jimmy Lunchbox undercuts the actor’s charisma and ultimately falls completely flat.
The comedic talent of Williams is not enough to save this train wreck. As if the lack of onscreen chemistry weren’t enough, the fact that neither he nor Travolta appear to have enjoyed making a single minute of the film makes viewing it all the more excruciating. Riding a jetpack to impress his neglected children smacks of then-actor, now-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in Jingle All the Way, and you know you’re in trouble when that becomes the gold standard for family comedy.
Anyone seeking a laugh this holiday season — especially children — should avoid Old Dogs at all costs.
Great review!  Especially liked the Dakota Fanning and Seth Green comments.

Matthew Howe is a warrior of the film industry with a harrowing survivor’s tale.
His outrageous adventures working on D-list films in New York are recounted in his recently released book, Film Is Hell: How I Sold My Soul to Make the Crappiest Movies in History. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in breaking into the ruthless world of filmmaking, as well as an entertaining and light comedic read for anyone who has ever felt like an underdog.
Howe was first attracted to the rush of filmmaking when he was 7 years old. He and his older brother wanted a camera so they could make movies, but they did not have any money to buy one. His solution was to write to the manufacturers and ask them to send him a broken Super-8 camera so he could repair it at a much lower cost.
After his plan succeeded, Howe’s thirst for filmmaking blossomed into an obsession.
“There was a side of me that was addicted to the whole crazy guerilla filmmaking thing,” Howe said.
He attended film school at Purchase College in Westchester County, NY, where his go-getter filmmaking attitude was cemented. The school is known for throwing its graduates out into the real world without any guidance, so the students adopted a devil-may-care attitude for their approach to filmmaking.
Howe, like most recent college graduates who have no idea what they are doing with their lives, struggled to find his place immediately after leaving Purchase. He was torn apart by the fear of failing, of becoming yet another starving artist.
But Howe’s love of film and drive to pursue his dreams finally lead him to join up with Sultan Film Productions Inc., the dreadfully disorganized independent production company that is the basis of his book. Sultan, based in New York, was populated with Purchase graduates.
“[I worked as] a major participant in the worst films in the history of the world,” Howe said, adding that the work drove himself to physical and emotional exhaustion.
His book follows the Sultan crew’s reckless escapades as they “scam their way on board nuclear submarines, hang precariously out of biplanes, get run over by tanks, brave cattle stampedes and infiltrate Navy SEAL exercises.”
Howe endured 20-hour workdays, received little or no pay and reaped no critical rewards. But he could not walk away.
When asked why he stayed even though he was so miserable, Howe replied, “I was a coward.”
Howe looks back on his experiences with Sultan with a mixture of relief and disdain.
“The only thing I got out of it was a book and some very hard life lessons,” he said.
The idea for putting his experiences on paper came slowly, but he felt like it was the natural step to take in sorting through the regrets of his past.
“What [Sultan] had done to me was just chewing at me,” Howe explained.
After leaving the company, he would frequently recount his Sultan adventures to co-workers on other film sets and found that people reacted strongly to his experiences because they were so unbelievable and hilariously extreme.
After tossing around the idea of writing his story for a while, a friend told him to “just do it,” and he finally buckled down and wrote his first book. Film Is Hell has been steadily garnering attention, especially among filmmakers who identify with his honesty and humor.
Now, Howe is happily writing novels, has had his short stories published in magazines, has sold a feature-length screenplay and is working as a cinematographer for television networks such as the Discovery Channel, TLC and The History Channel. He also photographs rock concerts for leisure, which he regularly posts on his website, shotmonster.com.
As he pointed out, “You gotta have something you do for love.”
Howe also offers advice for students and aspiring filmmakers.
“Your movie is your script and your actors,” he said. “And [as a filmmaker] you always have to be thinking three shots ahead.”
Finally, Howe believes filmmaking requires a great deal of flexibility. If a problem arises, Howe insists you must “find a way to work around it.”
As for writing, Howe has disciplined himself into writing at least 500 words a day, every day, even if the inspiration is lacking.
“If you do it every day, stuff gets done,” he said.
Although he may regret some of his past career decisions, Howe is remarkably upbeat and full of good humor. The fire that drew him to the crazy world of guerilla filmmaking may have been dampened by his experiences at Sultan, but it has certainly not dissipated altogether.
The life of a freelance filmmaker can be incredibly frustrating: There is no stability, and it is impossible to know whether or not the next month will be good or bad. But filmmakers like Howe have to stay true to their passions.
“I would go insane if I had a nine-to-five job,” he said.
The theme Howe discovered in writing his book is that every experience has two sides to it. You must take your struggles and use them, as Howe has done, to bring joy and insight to others.

As Voltaire once wrote: “It is a lamentable shame that to be a good patriot, one must become an enemy of the rest of mankind.”
War is brutal. War is without boundaries. War is intense. Those are the ideas that Infinity Ward took to heart when it set about creating the sequel to its widely successful Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. And in that case, it certainly succeeded.
Straight shooter · Modern Warfare 2 is the sixth installment in the Call of Duty series. The game is centered around Taskforce 141, an elite unit trained to hunt down Russian terrorists. - Photo courtesy of Activision
The story picks up five years after the events of the first game. The Russian Ultranationalist Party, the game’s villains, have risen to power, with its deceased leader Imran Zakhaev now hailed as a patriot. With a grand contingency plan at hand, Zakhaev’s protégé, the terrorist Vladimir Makarov, orchestrates an attack on Russian soil, setting off a chain of events that threaten to start World War III.
The player is thrown in with Taskforce 141, an elite multinational unit whose mission is to hunt down Makarov and bring him to justice. Only, the path to justice involves detours into Russian gulags, the streets of Virginia and the rooftops of Brazil.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is in many ways a continuation of what made the first game great. As a first-person shooter, the game is incredibly satisfying, with an easy to follow set of controls and a strong enemy computer opponent.
Also, the game is not centered on one event or field of combat. The player controls a wide range of characters, from US Army Rangers to British SAS officers and, in one breathtaking scene, an astronaut at the International Space Station. Modern Warfare 2 is as high quality as its predecessor.
Visually, Modern Warfare 2 is a masterpiece. Character movement looks and feels organic, while everything from weapons to backgrounds are rendered in gritty detail. Locations range from the claustrophobic favelas of Rio de Janeiro to snow-peaked mountains, and even to Washington, DC, once Makarov’s scheme comes into full effect. There are certain moments in the game where landscapes open up and reveal some breathtaking views.
One of the best parts of the game is how it advances the plot. Instead of the traditional cut scene, the story is told during game play, letting the player interact with plot-important characters and events.
The game feels like an interactive movie. Watching a cut scene of characters escaping from a collapsing prison? Moderately  entertaining.
Dodging falling cement and running through a maze of a prison in search of an exit? A thrilling conclusion to an intense level.
The game is wonderfully cinematic, with some of the events in the game rivaling the climaxes of big-budget Hollywood action films.
Not only is the game a visual and interactive treat, Infinity Ward sought out some serious actors to provide voice work. Kevin McKidd, of Journeyman, Rome and Grey’s Anatomy fame, stars as the commanding officer of Task Force 141, and protagonist of the previous game, Captain “Soap” MacTavish. He gives a great performance, mixing dry humor with more heroic tones.
Character actor Lance Henriksen plays General Shepherd, the man behind Taskforce 141, and gives many of the monologues an emotional weight that might otherwise have been lacking. Add in solid actors Keith David and Barry Pepper in supporting roles and the game’s movie-like qualities continue to coalesce.
But the game is not flawless. The single player campaign is relatively short and can be beaten in six to eight hours.
The story itself is so dependent on the events of the first Modern Warfare that new players will be easily confused, and even those who are familiar with the previous installment will find themselves a bit perplexed by unexplained and underdeveloped plot points.
The story has a great premise, but ultimately the execution feels rushed at times, and some interesting twists lose their impact due to ambiguity in their buildup.
But the multiplayer mode more than makes up for flaws in the single player levels. Whether playing with friends at home or online, Modern Warfare 2 features varied and numerous maps, allowing for endlessly original matches. Add in equipment customization and earned-by-experience perks, and multiplayer matches can be more challenging than the single-player campaign.
Is Modern Warfare 2 perfect? No, definitely not.
Is it the best action game of the year? Definitely.
With amazing production values, intense campaigns, a stellar voice cast and the best multiplayer among its peers, it is a truly entertaining game and holds up on multiple plays.
Why settle for lesser first-person shooters when this not only delivers in the format, but redefines it?

Keith Nelson never expected to be touring with KISS. Neither did he expect to be on tour for more than 260 days at a time.
But events have unfolded well for the lead guitarist of the popular modern rock band Buckcherry, which now faces the end of the lengthy tour that brought it back last week to the town that served as the band’s launchpad: Los Angeles.

Although Nelson grew up listening to music, at the time it wasn’t the music he wanted.
“We always had plenty of records in the house,” Nelson said. “And it was music that I love now, like the Motown and such, but back then I wanted stuff like KISS — rock ‘n’ roll.”
His musical career started when he was “banging on pots with spoons,” until he eventually moved to the guitar.
In 1995, Nelson and lead singer Josh Todd formed Buckcherry, and the band soon made its way through LA’s music scene, playing gigs along the revered Sunset Strip and constantly writing music. But like many other aspiring musicians, Nelson didn’t see himself becoming famous anytime soon.
“It always seemed so unattainable, because [being a professional rock musician] is such a lofty goal,” Nelson said. “The thought was always in the back of our minds, and it was a goal, but we never expected it to happen like it did.”
But Buckcherry didn’t just sit around and wait for its big break.
“We weren’t some art school kids waiting around for a deal to be handed to us,” Nelson said. “We wanted to be out there, playing all the time.”
In true Hollywood fashion, record executives heard what the band offered and liked it. The rest has been, as they say, history — albeit one fraught with classic problems, including the departure of some original members. Nelson and Todd have stuck around, however, like true founding fathers. Their dedication has paid off, leading to a Grammy nomination as well as multiple top-10 singles.
The band hit up Los Angeles last week with a stop at the Staples Center, and now Nelson looks forward to finishing up a tour that has lasted longer than a year; The last show is on Dec 6.
Touring is, as expected, an exhausting event. Many musicians tire of long schedules on the road, away from the sense of normality that home brings.
For Nelson, however, touring isn’t just work — it’s a way of life.
“Our first big tour was back in ’98 with, actually, KISS,” Nelson said. “It was weird jumping from our cars to a big van, which was awesome … It’s a learning experience, and you learn along the way how to be a better musician and a better businessman.”
Buckcherry is largely a touring rock band, like most rock bands of yore, and the band spends the majority of its time on the road. But in terms of the exhaustion factor, Nelson remains unfazed.
“Any musician who’s successful and complains about being out on the road should just stay home,” he said. “It’s just such an ungracious thing to whine about touring when you’re successful.”
Not that the repercussions of touring aren’t a consideration, especially to those in the band who have families. Nelson notes that being out of town seems to keep him behind on what’s going on in terms of a week-to-week or even a month-to-month basis.
But even with all the difficulties, the band has marched on, racking up tours with AC/DC and KISS as well as headlining its own tours, traveling most recently to Canada.
“Getting back to the studio is a treat,” Nelson said. “But the bulk of the work is on the road.”
Now that the tour is coming to a close, Nelson said he looks forward to fresh time in the studio to write and record new material. The band’s last album, Black Butterfly, did moderately well on the charts (peaking at No. 8 on the Billboard Top 200 chart) as well as critically, and now the band is planning to get to work, concentrating on crafting another successful record.
As for the more long-term future, Nelson hopes to continue “making great music and working for the people who want to hear it.”
There are, of course, great bands that have stood the test of time — for example, KISS still plays to enormous crowds all around the world.
“Of course I would love to continue to play. I mean, look at some of the bands today, like AC/DC or Metallica. They still have ‘it,’” Nelson said.
Even with these hopes, Nelson is fully aware of the danger of trying too hard.
“I don’t want to be old and playing county fairs,” he mused. “It’s important to stay relevant; when the passion is gone, it’s already too late.”

Syria is known as being a fairly progressive Islamic nation. Women wear jeans and go to school, and although they might not be considered entirely equal to men, they certainly enjoy a position of greater social power than their peers in countries such as Afghanistan.
Today, Syrian women are challenging the presumption that feminism and conservative Islam are opposing movements.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The country has experienced a religious revival in the past couple of years, with a new movement of conservative female preachers taking power.
In one sense, this movement is a testament to Syria’s progressive nature as a nation; after all, you won’t find women leading Catholic masses even here in the United States.
Yet the paradoxical factor in this trend is that while it may empower women, it won’t necessarily provide them with greater rights.
While feminists around the globe may rejoice at this ostensible victory for women’s rights, the movement may actually be working to stifle those very trends feminists have worked so hard to promote.
The fact that women have achieved positions of power in the country is a step forward for women’s rights, though the ideology they promote is not as progressive.
Radical Islam has been under tight governmental control in Syria since as early as the 1980s, when clashes between Baath and Sunni factions brought the country to the brink of a civil war. Fearing ongoing religious tensions like those seen in neighboring Middle Eastern countries, leaders decided to create a more moderate, government-sanctioned brand of Islam, opening up opportunities for women to step in as preachers.
The most influential of these women was Munira Qubaisia, who is now 70 and is said to have around 75,000 followers, according to BBC News. Known as the Anseh, these women are generally educated, upper-class women who are well-spoken authority figures within their communities.
Today, the Anseh have enjoyed a sudden revival, with more women coming to join the cause than ever before.
While this is a great forum to reach out to the community, the extremely conservative ideology could actually make Syrian society less open to feminist activities.
The shift is reminiscent of the anti-feminist Christian movement that surfaced in the United States in the 1970s. As a reaction to the social elements of that era, Christian women began to revolt through conservative Christianity. Leaders included Phyllis Schlafly, who effectively stopped the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.
Continuing this spirit of political activism today, Schlafly and her compatriots continue to use their religious views as both a source of empowerment and as a force of social conservativism.
On the one hand, they hope to deny women certain “feminist” rights, believing that women should abstain from sexual relations before marriage and should be subservient to the wishes of their husbands in a marriage.
Yet at the same time, they are highly successful professionally and publicly, enjoying large audiences and sizable paychecks for their writings, lectures and the like.
These conservative Islamic female preachers are enjoying an increased social status as a result of their leadership. But mirroring the tendencies of the Christian anti-feminists before them, there are some who feel the work of the preachers is denying certain progressive social elements of Syrian society,
The BBC quotes one Syrian girl, 16-year-old Hanan Kiftaro, who said, “I like [the preachers], they really care about every girl and make her feel important. But for me I take what I believe is right to do. I think God created us to enjoy life and not to be hard. I won’t be bad if I wear jeans, so I don’t care if they shout at me when I do things they don’t like.”
For Kiftaro, the socially progressive views of her larger society were strong enough to prevent her from becoming caught up in the more extreme conservative undertones of the Anseh.
And it is to the movement’s credit that she is still welcomed to return to meetings where she can engage with her spirituality and the community. Yet for those who are more easily influenced by the extremist elements of the movement, it could become a source of friction with the more secular elements of Syrian society.
So is the rise of conservative Islamic women in Syria a good thing, or a bad thing? Only time will tell whether these women will succeed in empowering women or, perhaps, denying them their rights.

Ali,
What is your deal?
Has Syria really changed since the Hama mass murders?  If so then why is Syria working intimately with Iran and Hezbollah?
First: The crimes of the massacres in Hama
During the two years, 1980-1981, the city of Hama witnessed several attacks that took the lives of hundreds of religious scholars, prominent people as well as ordinary citizens. But according to eyewitnesses and corresponding reports, what happened during the massacre of February can only be named as ‘mass murder’. Over 25,000 people were murdered by the Syrian authorities, which called upon the Special Forces and defence brigades and selected brigades from the army (brigade 47 and brigade 21) with their heavy arms supported by the air forces. Thus, the city became a large military work area. The canons and rocket launchers bombed the city haphazardly for four continuous weeks, during which the city was sealed off and the citizen’s exit was not permitted.
The destroying of districts and killing of the citizens, including entire families:
During the period of mass murder, the regime killed all citizens in certain districts and wiped out entire families.
The massacre in the new Hama district:
On the 3rd day of invading the city of Hama, the Syrian regime defence brigades gathered the citizens of the ‘new Hama district’, in the football field and shot them. Then they raided the houses and killed everyone there. They robbed the people of their belongings. Some sources estimate the victims of the district to be around 1500….
Syira a progressive state?  That’s like saying “there’s occassionally violence in Sudan”.
Could you define what “progressive” means to you?  Do you mean that compared to the Islamic nation of Iran that Syria is a beacon of light?  Or that compared to the Sharia ruled nation of Saudi Arabia that Syria is sort of like Australia?  Wow!  Comparing Syria to Iran and saying Syria is progressive is really a strong statement.
While you’re at it, and given your obvious expertise in all things Syria, could you let us know how many of the assassinations of Christian Lebanese ploitcal figures is Syria implictaed in?
And, lastly, why is it a progressive Islamic country like Syrai has been ruled by the same dictatorial family for something like fifty years?
Syria is a SECULAR state with a majority Muslim population and a large Christian minority.
How exactly is it correct to call it an “Islamic State,” or to make the bizarre comparison with Afghanistan (which is over 2000 miles away and is not an Arab country)? It seems that there is an underlying assumption here that all Muslims are the same, and even though they live in distinct countries they tend to act all the same. a LITTLE disturbing to me as a Muslim, to say the least.
This article mixes different definitions of the terms “conservative” and “progressive” so much it makes my head spin. It sounds like Syria has successfully nurtured a moderate form of Islam (if there truly can be such a thing) that is open to women’s rights. You are against that why? Because they might encourage these women to do “conservative” things like seek happy marriages, remain sexually modest, and respect themselves?
I assume when you use the word “socially conservative” in reference to Christian women in America, you mean that they are in favor of female self-respect, and opposed to abortion. You use that term like it’s a bad thing, and anti-feminist movement. It is not. A nation that embraces women  as equals in the professional sphere, but also respects them as women and as human beings, is a nation moving in the right direction.
Significant “rights” have been denied us by the radical feminist agenda. The right to common sense is one that has been badly abused, with feminists arguing till they’re blue in the face that women=men in every respect. Thanks to this complete inability to deal with reality, we have lower standards for soldiers, firefighters and police officers. This has not been “progressive” for anyone. We have rampant divorce, which is crippling to children. We have untold numbers of young women longing for a permanent committed relationship, but who have been duped by the feminists into believing they can trade on their sexuality (like promiscuous men) and not have it hurt their psyches or their shot at happiness, monogamy or an STD-free life.
These outcomes, my friend Rosaleen, are the “certain rights” that Christian conservative women argue against. And they have a darn good point.

As we’ve witnessed throughout the past year, change is immutable.
The year opened with a historical moment, the inauguration of the first African-American president in the United States, Barack Obama.

Followed by some unforgettable occurrences in pop culture as well — the Rihanna/Chris Brown debacle, the rise of Lady Gaga and Twilight takeover, to name a few — for many of us, 2009 was most vividly defined by transition.
In 2009, USC also had its fair share of adjustments. In light of the November announcement of USC President Steven B. Sample’s upcoming resignation, the university will undoubtedly face a shift with new leadership.
In just a decade’s time under Sample’s leadership, USC has reached more academic accomplishments than the university has ever seen before, marked by a increasingly competitive applicant pool, rising SAT scores, higher GPAs of admitted freshmen and an impressive 90 percent graduation rate.
With a diverse enrollment of students from all 50 states and more than 115 different countries, not to mention 232 National Merit scholars, USC is currently ranked 26th in the annual US News & World Report.
The school has also made strides in other areas, most notably in the development of the University Park community. During his 19 years in office, Sample has been committed to outreach in local neighborhoods, as demonstrated by his undertaking of the Master Plan, a 30-year development project to improve USC’s campus and surrounding areas.
Whoever Sample’s successor is, he or she will surely inherit the continued challenges of raising the bar in USC academics, recruitment and community outreach.
And while a continued focus on academics and the school’s place in the community remains important, we shouldn’t forget one initiative that has risen under Sample’s leadership, along with the dedicated help of Executive Vice President and Provost C.L. Max Nikias: the Arts & Humanities Initiative.
With Sample, Nikias established Visions and Voices, the successful university-wide arts and humanities effort that has further ingrained USC’s place as a leading institution.
When compared to other top national universities, the need for an enhanced focus on the arts was obvious. Together, Nikias and Sample answered this need.
Since the program’s launch two years ago, the Visions and Voices initiative has provided USC students with increased opportunities to explore the arts regardless of their areas of study.
A calendar of unique Vision and Voices events, including theater shows, musical performances, lectures and more, help foster USC’s goal of “breadth and depth.”
This past semester, Nikias’ idea has taken off. In Vision and Voices’ second installment, students and staff from five of USC’s professional schools joined together in October to hold a day-long art festival in celebration of the film, music and the arts. Students helped organize of the event and, just as the mission behind Vision and Voices intended, it appears that student interest and involvement in the arts is emerging.
With USC on the right trajectory for artistic development, will the incoming administration’s agenda continue to provide for one of USC’s necessary areas of attention?
In 2010, priorities should be set while helping continued responsibility to arts and humanities in mind. Though it will be important to develop USC on many levels, specific attention to the arts cannot be lost.
Both Sample and Nikias have done a lot to highlight the importance of arts and humanities aside from Visions and Voices, such as the increase in range of offered curriculum as well as the university’s promotion of Renaissance Scholars.
USC’s new leader cannot let these efforts fall to the wayside. With an endowment in flux and a slowly rebounding economy, it is easier to focus on the school’s aspects that directly affect its endowment. USC must not fall into this mindset.
And though a large part of the burden falls on the new administration to still consider this initiative an important part of the school, it’s ultimately up to the students to stay involved — first and foremost by taking advantage of the programs offered them.
While USC grows academically, it is on the students’ parts to actually attend arts events, relay feedback to event organizers and take projects to the next level within the spectrum of arts and humanities. It is in the students’ hands to show administration that USC’s development of the arts is important to them.
Change may be a good thing, but a change in USC’s commitment to the arts won’t be.
