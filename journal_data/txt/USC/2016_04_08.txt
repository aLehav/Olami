I don’t think I realized how much being an editor for the Daily Trojan would consume my life until I found myself sending messages about breaking news stories at 3 a.m. In high school and even during my first semester of college, journalism was, for me, kept in its own category of my life, one that (much like class or sleep) didn’t overlap with other things that I did. I had a set time that I “did journalism” — whether that meant conducting an interview, writing a story or making edits — and after I finished, I moved on to something else until the next assignment came around.
Being a news editor changed all that. I realized that news doesn’t stop just because I leave the newsroom or start doing my homework or — however rarely — go to sleep. News happens at all hours of the day, whether I am at work or in class or eating dinner, and I have to be prepared to respond to it because that’s what being an editor means. It’s knowing everything that’s happening, all the time, and figuring out how to convey this information to the student body through the Daily Trojan — which all sounds pretty impossible. And technically, it is — no single human being can possibly keep tabs on everything that goes on around a 226-acre campus, the surrounding neighborhood, the separate Health Sciences Campus several miles away and all of the students and faculty that are somehow affiliated with USC even if they’re not physically present at the University. 
That’s why I work with a news team — the eyes and ears of the Daily Trojan across campus whom I can always count on to pick up a developing story or pitch an idea when they hear of something worth writing about. I’m just one news editor, but each person I’m connected to — from my co-editors to the other members of the editorial board to our Assistant City Editors to our staff writers — forms another layer of the web that helps me know what’s going on around USC. 
Donna Haraway wrote in “Situated Knowledges” that truth comes not from one single omniscient perspective, but from a multitude of subjective experiences that come together in conversation. I’m learning more and more that these situated knowledges are at the heart of journalism, whether it’s a writer getting the story by interviewing multiple sources or an editor (such as myself) calling upon multiple writers to create one cohesive paper. And most strongly, I’ve felt the impact of these multiple perspectives in the work of my fellow editors, each of whom contribute to make the news section and the Daily Trojan as a whole not just possible, but great. 
I’ve learned that journalism doesn’t just take place at one time, and it’s not “done” by just one person. So it isn’t too much of a stretch to say that it isn’t just one thing, but many things, most of which I’m still learning about and some that I haven’t even thought of yet. Every time I assign a new story or design another page, I see another dimension to journalism, and I’m excited to maintain that process of discovery. I’ve just started my journey at USC and at the Daily Trojan, but I know that when my phone buzzes at 3 a.m., I’ll always take the call.

At the L.A. Times Festival of Books, the fun and inspiration does not end after sunset. This year, the Festival will be sponsoring six evening events for music, film and literary enthusiasts from April 8 to April 16. With double the events from last year, the Festival After Dark promises to not disappoint those who wish to make the most of their experience at the world’s largest book festival.
On Friday, the famous Literary Death Match will be celebrating its 10th anniversary by continuing its partnership with the Festival of Books. This popular event will be held at Largo at the Coronet on La Cienega Blvd. At the Death Match, four writers will have seven minutes or less to read their own work and will be judged by a panel of celebrity judges. After deliberation, the top two finalists will compete in the epic Literary Death Match finale, a game competition that will ultimately decide the victor. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jane Smiley and HBO Silicon Valley actor Thomas Middleditch will join the panel of judges, while Girls executive producer Bruce Eric Kaplan will be one of the four readers competing in the event.
Saturday boasts of three exciting events across Los Angeles. The first is The Objectively Hottest Authors on Earth LIVE!, an interview talk show hosted by comedian Sara Benincasa. At the NerdMelt Showroom, Benincasa will be speaking with multiple authors and comedians throughout the night. It is guaranteed to be a hilarious and entertaining experience for all who attend. The next is the USC School of Dramatic Arts’ very own spring musical “A Little Night Music.” Attendees will have the opportunity to purchase two tickets at the price of one through a special discount code presented at the box office window.
Finally, the Library Foundation of Los Angeles will be returning to the Festival of Dark with its 5th Annual Book Drop Bash at the L.A. Central Library. Along with music, the party will have complimentary food and drink. For admission, each attendee is recommended to bring at least one book for the big Book Swap!
The Festival After Dark continues after the conclusion of the main festival with two final events hosted at USC. On April 14, USC’s Visions and Voices will have the honor of hosting the world premiere of Edgar Arceneaux’s film Until, Until, Until…, which will be held at the Ray Stark Family Theatre. The film explores Ben Vereen’s controversially censored performance at President Ronald Reagan’s inauguration ceremony in 1981. Actor and musician Ben Vereen provides personal commentary about the event in the film and discusses the implications of racism, segregation and censorship in the media during the late twentieth century. The film will allow its audiences to think more deeply about their knowledge of historic events and reconsider what they know to be truth. The event will be free to USC students and all members of the general public.
Finally, the Festival After Dark will conclude on April 16 with a stimulating performance from opera and performance artist M. Lamar. M. Lamar’s Funeral Doom Spiritual: For Male Soprano, Piano, and Electronics is inspired by themes of apocalypse, white supremacy and black resentment and is bound to spark conversation.
Some Festival After Dark events will require advance ticket purchases. More information can be found online.

When non-tenure track faculty at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences voted not to join the SEIU Local 721 labor union, supporters of unionization were disappointed. However, they also said they were angry at what they saw as interference with the voting process on the part of the University. After the ballots were counted in February, they brought their complaint to the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that Provost Michael Quick and Academic Senate President Ginger Clark had used threats and last-minute pay raises to convince faculty members not to unionize.
A report released by the NLRB Monday supported these objections and rendered the original Dornsife vote invalid. The ruling, issued by NLRB Hearing Officer Yaneth Palencia, found that Quick and the USC administration broke federal labor laws by attempting to dissuade adjunct faculty from voting for the union. Though the University will face no legal action, the vote results will be set aside and a new vote will take place within the coming weeks. Votes at the Roski School of Fine Arts and the USC International Academy, which voted to unionize, will remain in place.
SEIU Local 721 petitioned the case to the NLRB on behalf of Dornsife non-tenure track faculty in a hearing that took place in February, during which Palencia heard testimony from both the faculty members and the University. According to the report, SEIU alleged that Quick told faculty that joining a union might prevent them from participating in the Academic Senate, which is described by the Senate Constitution as the “representative body of the faculty at large for university wide issues.”
In the testimony, faculty recalled Quick saying at a Jan. 11 meeting that unionization “would create an adversarial relationship,” and that unionized faculty from Dornsife, Roski and the International Academy “would not be wanted on the Academic Senate.” Quick echoed these statements in emails sent throughout the months preceding the vote, in which he urged non-tenure track faculty to reconsider voting to join the union. The petitioners claimed that the language in these emails as well as in his spoken statements was threatening enough to prevent some faculty from voting.
Petitioners also objected to Clark’s attempt to remedy faculty grievances prior to the vote as a way to convince faculty that unionization was unnecessary, a claim that Palencia rejected in the report. However, she sustained faculty objections to pay increases that Quick introduced as little as a week prior to the vote, writing that these actions in conjunction with the threats to faculty governance were enough to render the vote invalid.
“Provost Quick engaged in conduct that was so aggravated as to create a general atmosphere of fear making a free election impossible,” Palencia wrote in the report.
The ruling was met with praise from SEIU Local 721 President Bob Schoonover, who wrote that the findings “make it abundantly clear” that the actions of the university administration would have consequences.
“If you engage in illegal union-busting tactics we will hold you accountable,” Schoonover said in a press release.
The University, however, has denied the allegations that it threatened to remove unionized faculty from participating in the Academic Senate. Instead, it claims that Quick’s statements on the matter were simply meant to show that SEIU, and not the University, would be in charge of faculty governance if unionization were to take place. In a letter sent to faculty on Wednesday, Quick wrote that he is a “strong supporter of faculty governance” and that he never meant to dissuade anyone from voting.
“I believe that the initial vote — the will of the majority — should be respected,” Quick wrote in the letter. “I also know that a re-vote would be burdensome. But should a re-vote occur, I hope all Dornsife teaching faculty will turn out for this important vote.”
Some faculty members, however, believe that it may  be too late to unionize. Andrea Parra, an associate professor of Spanish in the department of Spanish and Portuguese and a strong supporter of joining the union, said that she is hopeful that the results will be different this time around, but that nothing is guaranteed.
“I think the whole back and forth has turned people off to the issue,” Parra said. “I’m hopeful that more people will turn out, but it’s hard for me [to know]. I don’t have the crystal ball.”
Unions ruin everything. Remember that. Unions have no business in private schools. 
union busting ruins everything
Actually, no.  “Union Busting” is a fantastic idea.  Public unions have largely outserved their original purpose.  When unions first formed, they served a very noble purpose because labour was largely unregulated and unorganized, and workers enjoyed few protections under the hands of zealous or unscrupulous companies.  Today, those grievances have all been addressed as a matter of law that governs labour at the federal and state levels.  The unions now serve largely as puppets of the Democratic party, using their money and weight to enforce burdensome and onerous provisions on the very companies that employ their membership.  (And lets not forget about the widespread corruption and secrecy.)  In a way, the oppressed has become the oppressor.
you just show your stupidity.

Three out of 14 recipients of the 2016 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage Award discussed the issues surrounding human rights, women’s equality and social progress at a panel Thursday in Wallis Annenberg Hall.
The discussion was hosted by the Institute for Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg and the panel included Nisha Ayub, a transgender rights advocate in Malaysia; Rodjaraeg Wattanapanit, the co-owner of a bookstore, Book Re:public, and co-founder of Creating Awareness for Enhanced Democracy; and Nihal Naj Ali Al-Awlaqi the minister of legal affairs of Yemen. The panel was moderated by Stéfanie von Hlatky, a visiting scholar at the Center on Public Diplomacy and assistant professor of political studies at Queen’s University. Al-Awlaqi and Wattanapanit spoke through translators.
Other recipients of the award, Latifa Ibn Ziaten from France, Debra Baptist-Estrada from Belize, Thelma Aldana from Guatemala, Nagham Nawzat from Iraq, Vicky Ntetema from Tanzania and Zuzana Števulová from Slovakia joined the event as audience members.
Each panelist was asked two questions from von Hlatky. Al-Awlaqi opened the discussion by answering the question of how she raised awareness of women’s rights in her country. She started off by describing the nature of women’s rights.
“As it is well-known, women’s rights are part of human rights. Once you have real guarantee of freedoms and human rights, women will benefit from that,” Al-Awlaqi said.
She then described her work for women’s rights in Yemen. Al-Awlaqi explained that women put the foundation for the new Yemen after the 2012 Yemeni Revolution.
“I believe we have accomplished a great remarkable victory by having women represented by no less than 30 percent in all three branches of our government,” Al-Awlaqi said. “That was mostly done because of the recommendations we have issued after the national dialogue conference, sponsored by the United Nations and many international partners.”
The moderator asked about the importance of educating young people about due process and democracy. Al-Awlaqi explained how the cornerstones of democracy are the rule of the people, political diversity and human rights.
“It is really a culture and attitude,” Al-Awlaqi said. “Therefore, raising children on accepting others, being independent and respecting human rights will reflect on their cultural and political behaviors. You will also see fruitful results of that in school and throughout their lives.”
Ayub was then asked about her thoughts on the pace of change. She discussed how Malaysia is starting to change despite the Sharia Law, which considers being gay a punishable offense.
“It is slow, but there is a progression,” Ayub said. “There is more awareness because of the visibility of the trans community. Most often within the LGBT community, the transgender community, especially the transwomen community — we are the most affected because of the Sharia Law back home in Malaysia.”
Ayub continued on how she recently challenged the system in Malaysia along with three transwomen and how the action attracted national attention.
“We were the first Malaysians to challenge the Sharia Law and that opened the mindset of the system,” Ayub said. “I think this is a first step. I encourage more trans people, not from just Malaysia but from around the world, to talk about trans issues and become more visible, because when you start to talk, people will start to realize that we are actually human beings.”
Ayub was then asked about how her personal challenges have affected her in terms of formulating strategies as an activist.
“I try to engage public without making them feel fear,” Ayub said. “I try to touch base on human values. Share our stories. I interviewed transgender women and men from all races to share their own personal stories, whether they are from prison, whether they are from discrimination in school or even their own families.”
Lastly, Wattanapanit was asked questions about what advice she would give to younger women to protect their rights and themselves. She began her response by relating how she had to escape the country to not get captured by the military. She explained that she returned home when her safety was secured as the martial law announced that the people who were arrested will be detained for seven days.
“Before we stand up to fight for any cause, we not only have to assess the situation, the environment, the atmosphere, but also look at our own safety as well,” Wattanapanit said.
Wattanpanit also spoke about how this applies to college advocates.
“When I train with the students I tell them that your family will be threatened by the military regime. So talk to them if they are ready for that,” Wattanpanit said. “And for college students, a lot of time when they stand up for their rights, they mostly get suspended from school. I also tell my college students, ‘be brave, but don’t be crazy.’”
Dr. Paul R. McHugh, the former psychiatrist-in-chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital and its current Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry, said that transgenderism is a “mental disorder” that merits treatment, that sex change is “biologically impossible,” and that people who promote sexual reassignment surgery are collaborating with and promoting a mental disorder.
Guess what? 
 The American College of Pediatricians (ACP) issued a warning of the dangers that gender ideology poses to children and adolescents, 
The recent ACP statement denied much of the politically correct rhetoric used by transgender activists, with doctors calling for a more sober and realistic look at what the idea of gender fluidity actually does to children.
Like a splash of ice water, the pediatricians declared that human sexuality is “an objective biological binary trait” rather than an infinite series of self-determined “genders.” 
The norm for human design, the doctors said, “is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species,” and therefore, “XY” and “XX” are “genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder.”
While everyone is born with a biological sex, the doctors noted, their awareness of their sexuality develops over time and “may be derailed by a child’s subjective perceptions, relationships, and adverse experiences from infancy forward.” Helping them accept their objective sexual identity is one of the objectives of good parenting and intelligent education.
“A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking,” the physicians said. 
“When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such.”
Therefore, to treat this gender confusion as a good and normal thing, or to encourage it as LGBT activists and college student virtue-signallers are doing, constitutes an attack on children that can only mean serious problems for them in the future.
Thinking of oneself as belonging to a different sex than one’s biological sex is a psychological pathology known as “gender dysphoria,” the pediatricians said, which is “a recognized mental disorder.”
The doctors also noted that the use of puberty-blocking hormones, a common treatment among the promoters of gender ideology, is exceedingly dangerous and involves serious health risks including “high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke and cancer.” Moreover, suicide rates “are twenty times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery,” they added.
Pulling no punches, the doctors stated that conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is “child abuse.”
This is the conditioning that  your friendly neighborhood college-aged social justice warriors and the LGBT lobby are trying to foist on parents and educators as somehow the right way to treat sexually confused children.
And yet, the doctors insist, what “compassionate and reasonable person would condemn young children to this fate knowing that after puberty as many as 88% of girls and 98% of boys will eventually accept reality and achieve a state of mental and physical health?”
What sort of person, indeed.

To discuss the importance of the Latino vote and strategies the 2016 presidential candidates should take to get their vote, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted the event “Election 2016: Latino Voters and the Issues that Matter” in partnership with the Latina/o Student Assembly and Political Student Assembly Thursday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The panel, the third installment in the “It’s Our Election Too” series, featured Communications and Marketing Director of First 5 LA Gabriel Sanchez, Unruh Director Dan Schnur, Multicultural Greek Council President Alexa Chande and Hermanas Unidas member Brandi Montañez comprised the rest of the panel.
The panelists stressed the importance of young Latino voters and advised candidates to access both sides of the Latino generational gap.
“That’s the big key which we have to tap into: how we are bridging the gap between people who are going to college that are coming out to vote and people related to them, like their parents,” Chande said. “The candidate that gets those people out there and that is able to bridge the gap will most likely find the most success.”
As a Latina herself, Chande believes that older generations face different issues than their children or grandchildren. However, young Latinos and Latinas can educate their parents on the political issues that matter to them.
“We have that responsibility and that very close connection with our parents to be able to educate them and help them make decisions that are ultimately going to affect them in their future,” Chande said.
Sanchez shared successful creative tactics, like novellas and live comic books, used to reach the Latino audience and educate them about the importance of healthcare.
“It’s not simply translation, but trans-adapting,” Sanchez said. “You have to know what a general audience is looking for and what messages are acceptable. It’s thinking about what channels your audiences [are] using.”
Shifting back to politics, the panelists discussed how the presidential candidates’ viewpoints on health care will influence Latino votes.
“Whichever candidate puts cultural competency in healthcare on their platform should be very important,” Montañez said.
Schnur believed that the rhetoric surrounding healthcare policy needs to be simplified.
“I’d say for most voters it comes back to a matter of comfort,” Schnur said. “It doesn’t matter whether you are someone who’s just arrived in this country or a sixth generation. This is a very complicated system to understand.”
The panel raised the issue of the  media’s extensive coverage of immigration and how it is often portrayed as a priority for Latino voters. The panelists agreed that the education and economic opportunity are Latinos’ top concerns.
While Sanchez believed that immigration was an “indicator” of  a candidate’s ethos, Schnur thought it’s a “boulder.”
“It’s a really large rock in the road that prevents candidates from being heard by voters who would otherwise be willing to listen to them,” Schnur said.
Sanchez asserted that the fundamental issue is that Latinos need to actually go to the polls.
“Latinos nationwide need to be at the table,” Sanchez said. “That is, participating regardless if it’s for one candidate or the other. It’s actually showing up.”

A panel of USC professors shared the personal struggles and disadvantages they have faced in their careers as educators because of their race during a forum at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Thursday. The event, hosted by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and Academic Culture Assembly, featured former winners of the USC Professors of Color Award while this year’s winners were being selected.
The Professors of Color Award recognizes faculty and staff members of color at USC that demonstrate exemplary behavior both inside and outside the classroom. Panelists said that as professors of color, they can often become isolated within their departments as they disproportionately carry the weight of mentoring and supporting similarly marginalized students.
“Being a person of color, you are already walking on this tightrope and people are watching,” said Terence Fitzgerald, a professor in the School of Social Work. “They have stereotypes. They have perceptions that been ingrained since the beginning of this country. When you are in that environment, when you are still the minority, there is still that perception. And it does not matter how many letters I have after my name, you are still viewed under that racial lens.”
The professors highlighted examples of the demeaning rhetoric they experience as minorities in academia. Dr. Neelesh Tiruviluamala, who teaches math in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, emphasized the ways in which students’ race can have a negative impact on their interests in particular subjects because of the racial stigmas attached to them. Tiruviluamala said that he is working on a mentorship program in East Los Angeles where college math students would demonstrate to children from communities of color looking to study math beyond high school that they too can succeed in math.
“There are so many assumptions about people and what they do and stupid stereotypes about some people being good at math that we actually believe these things and it actually makes a difference,” Tiruviluamala said. “How you look and the culture of where you come from can change how you feel and your ability. And when it comes to math, which is something innate, it is especially dangerous.”
Each of the panelists stated that they have heavily relied on mentors on their paths to becoming professors. Tracy Tambascia, a professor at the USC Rossier School of Education, said that being a minority has caused her to be “a fighter,” because she feels overwhelmingly underestimated by her peers. She conceded that this is part of the journey of being a minority professor, but that she appreciates that she now has a seat at the table from which she can influence other students of color to pursue higher education.
Tambascia, who is Asian, said that the racist comments she receives frequently resulted in her being a strong student administrator and advocate for her students.
“I am always underestimated,” Tambascia said. “I get backhanded comments like ‘you are very articulate.’ But that is part of the journey. I have learned to work harder.”
Andrea Grace Parra, a professor in Dornsife’s Department of Spanish and Portuguese, added that there are certain disadvantages that minorities can overcome if they maintain their strengths and values. Fitzgerald agreed that minority professors are held to a different standard, and brought up his own experiences working in public schools in marginalized communities.
“Some days I don’t like to talk about how it feels like to be in my skin,” Fitzgerald said. “Having the degrees I have and still feeling like I am nothing in 2016 … is insulting. But you push through it.”
