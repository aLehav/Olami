Humor me while I set the scene.
You’re perusing a modern art museum, well-aware that you’re surrounded by some of the most esteemed objects to grace the last century. You round the corner and come face to face with a sloppy amalgam of hasty scribbles or an installation of a thousand pieces of candy on the ground or, God forbid, a staggeringly unremarkable wooden chair. 
Without meaning to, your first reaction is: “I could have done that.” You lament that you didn’t shirk your undergraduate degree to sell Crayola doodles to art collectors, and, by extension, you belittle the artist’s vision and the systems of power that legitimize the work. 
Just because I pretentiously own a keychain bearing artist Craig Damrauer’s equation pondering the nature of modern art — “Modern art = I could do that + Yeah, but you didn’t” — doesn’t mean I am qualified to speak to why I believe this reaction is utter B.S., but it won’t stop me from sharing my two cents. 
I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with the natural inclination to downplay the technical skill associated with modern art. It took multiple modern art history courses and museum internships to advance my own way of thinking on the matter. What’s more, centuries of art history contribute to the myth that to be truly considered high art, a work must display technical skill, evoke viewing pleasure and be aesthetically harmonious in its formal elements. A revolutionary departure from this traditional way of thinking only really began in the last 150 years, when ideas themselves came to be regarded as works of art. But I want to do my part in shattering the illusion that some objects don’t deserve to be called art because they appear “easy” to make — if you think technical complexity is a prerequisite for art, you’re missing the point. 
First, consider whether you really could have made the art. When it comes to paintings like Cy Twombly’s graffiti-like scratches and scrawls or Piet Mondrian’s color-block oil paintings that appear to require the motor skills of a toddler, it’s easy to think that you could have. But these artists had to painstakingly mix colors and materials; apply balanced, crisp lines to canvas; draft, experiment, scrap and re-draft; await the inevitable criticism from curators and collectors and repeatedly defend the motivations and meanings behind the forms of expression they chose. They not only had to conceive and produce a work, but they also had to navigate art and its markets so expertly that their so-called splotches and rectangles came to be worth millions. 
Even with readymade art that the average adult could likely reproduce with ease — such as Felix Gonzalez-Torres’ installation of two synchronized analog clocks on a wall — there’s more to it than meets the eye. The piece, “Untitled (Perfect Lovers),” is meant to metaphorize the harmony of two lovers who will inevitably fall out of sync someday. The meaning of the work is made even more profound when you consider that he made it shortly after his partner, who died sooner and whose figurative clock battery tapered out first, was diagnosed with AIDS. So even if you were to execute a perfect replica, it would not be art in the same way Gonzalez-Torres’ version is art. It would lack the circumstances of creation that imbue it with meaning. 
Especially with modern art, the goal of the artist is not to leave you in awe of their flawless craftsmanship but to elicit a thoughtful response. You’re not supposed to gaze in wonder at the sublime beauty of Andres Serrano’s “Piss Christ,” a photograph of a crucifix figurine immersed in — you guessed it, urine — you’re supposed to be stunned, offended, disgusted. You’re not supposed to see the reckless brushstrokes on Willem de Kooning’s abstract female nude series as lazy or sloppy, you’re supposed to contemplate that it took him over 200 sketches to achieve precision in grotesqueness and that the painting brilliantly subverts classical traditions. 
Everything in art has purpose, including the movement away from showcasing technical skills and into conceptualism where ideas speak for themselves. Whether to overturn dominant trends, highlight the inherent value of objects or undermine the commercial system of the art world, nothing in art happens by accident. Nothing happens independent of sociopolitical circumstances, either. In tandem with global industrialization and the introduction of unskilled labor, the art world has evolved to host new methods of production, like photography and readymade objects, that challenge the value of spending years perfecting a magnum opus. 
It’s up to viewers to open our minds and escape the restricted mentality that art is not art unless it fits into strictly traditional, technical norms. The modern movement demands an entirely different set of skills that the untrained artist is hardly capable of perfecting to a comparable degree: empathy, observation, deduction, radical thought, avant-garde interpretation, the ability to react to the world with an arsenal of unprecedented self-expression. Now, can you do that? (And make a living while you’re at it?) 
Art can be — and is — a splatter of paint, a collage of plastic straws, a tin can of feces, a woman inviting gallery-goers to cut clothes off her. Instead of trivializing the art itself by assuming it takes no skill, stop and ask why the artist did what they did and what response they hoped to evoke in you by doing so. Next time, dig a little deeper.

Early last year, USC doctoral student Kursat Pekgoz filed Title IX complaints against USC, Princeton University and Yale University despite having no affiliation with the latter two institutions. In his complaint, Pekgoz claims that these institutions host programs that discriminate against men. The programs in question are women’s initiatives like the Yale University Women’s Organization and the Women Empowering Women Leadership Conference. In response, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights launched investigations into Yale and USC, both of which are still open.
The Office for Civil Rights should not spend time investigating this complaint at any of the three institutions. Pekgoz’s complaint is unfounded and focuses solely on a singular statistic rather than looking at the equality of specific rights and structures within higher education.
Though female representation is increasing at universities like Yale and USC, there are still societal and structural disadvantages that women in higher education face. Admissions and hiring both suffer from bias, and fields dominated traditionally male have a track record of low female enrollment.
The main evidence Pekgoz depends on is the close-to-equal representation of genders at Yale, and increasing numbers of female enrollment. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that Yale’s enrollment during the 2017-18 academic year comprised 49 percent female-identifying students and 51 percent male-identifying students. 
But this is just overall enrollment. There are variations in gender proportion within each school and field of study. There are variations in aid, scholarships and leadership positions. Overall enrollment does not reflect other areas of student opportunities.
In areas of study like management or law, there are significantly fewer women than men enrolled at Yale, according to the university’s most recently published student profile fact sheet for the 2016-17 academic year. Furthermore, there are 20 percent fewer women than men working toward doctorates at Yale.
Even after graduation, there is a clear gender wage gap, despite the sample pool having the same degrees from the same institutions. A Forbes study of the gender wage gap for new graduates published last year reported that “the average male in [the] study is earning $59,000, while the average female is earning 19 percent less with a salary of $48,000.” 
At its core, academia is nowhere near closing the gender gap, and to get rid of these initiatives would hurt progress towards equality. Every dean and department chair of Yale School of Engineering and Applied Science are male. Yale’s department of mathematics consists of only one female faculty member. 
Women are still underrepresented in leadership positions and roles in which they can take advantage of resources that are available to the entire student body. The initiatives Pekgoz takes issue with provide various scholarships and resources to women — much needed opportunities to get their feet in the door.
“I oppose feminism in colleges because women often have special privileges in academia that men do not have,” Pekgoz said in an interview with Refinery29. “That’s probably why male enrollment is so low.” 
Feminism is a call for equality, and these “special privileges” Pekgoz wants to eliminate are steps towards equality, not away from it. In our patriarchal society, opportunities for women can be far and few in between, and these initiatives and programs level the field for women to enter academia and bring higher education closer to equality.

Sustainability — it’s everyone’s new favorite buzzword. Almost all of my Google searches begin with the word “sustainable” and end with items ranging from “tennis shoes” to “lunchbox.” And in the last three months alone, 24 of my Google searches began with the word. 
This topic has become increasingly mainstream in the American collective conscience over the past decade. Many businesses today advertise their products as sustainable or environmentally conscious. Nike, one of the largest, most profitable sports brands in the world according to Forbes, has been moving toward sustainability efforts since 2015. Students across the nation are pushing university administrators to create more sustainable campuses and to become leaders on sustainability. 
But as the term grows in popularity, it’s important to examine its meaning and origins.
Defined by the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development in a commonly cited 1987 report, sustainable development is “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” 
Simply put, sustainability is the notion that we behave in a way that is conscious of the limited resources our environment has to offer. It also has strong ties to the concept of climate change. 
The United Nations describes climate change as “the defining issue of our time,” and doctors warned in a report published by The Lancet medical journal that climate change is “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.”
Climate change is defined by the UN as changes to the atmosphere caused by human activity. In an article by NASA, 97 percent of published climate scientists agree that the current drastic changes to our climate is “extremely likely” to be caused by human activities. 
Americans are beginning to recognize the direct impact climate change can have on their lives, especially for those living in coastal areas. According to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey, about 60 percent of Americans say climate change is at least somewhat affecting their local community. People living on the coasts are more likely to say they are affected by climate change because of rising sea levels, which can endanger coastal communities already vulnerable to storm surges and flooding.
According to an October 2018 report by the International Panel on Climate Change, there are just 12 years left to cut global emissions and limit the devastating effects of global warming. This report laid out that there is just over a decade to bring about tangible change, shocking many people into action. 
Climate change is already affecting parts of the world in dramatic ways. More intense climate patterns increasingly lead to more devastating weather. Bigger hurricanes. More intense droughts. More aggressive wildfires. All of these natural disasters are already happening and have a very profound impact on lives everywhere.
AccuWeather predicts that the total economic losses from the historic 2018 California wildfires will amount to $400 billion, “making it the most expensive natural disaster in the history of the United States.” The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has already spent a record $1 billion fighting the 2018 wildfires. 
It’s undeniable that climate change is a very real threat already impacting people across the globe, including everyone here in Los Angeles. 
Sustainability and climate change go hand in hand — sustainability is seen as a way to curb the planet’s exponential warming. The concept is critical in moving toward a healthier planet and viable future for the coming generations. 
That’s the sustainability element of this column. The “showdown?” It’ll illustrate the best practices for leading a sustainable life. 
Once you begin the foray into being a more environmentally aware person, you will quickly realize everyone is faced with daily choices on how to lead the most eco-friendly lifestyle — and that requires a nuanced analysis. 
This column will explore such decisions and hopefully determine what the most sustainable option actually is. Glasses or contacts? Drive 30 minutes to the brick and mortar store or have your purchases delivered? Shoes that were sustainably sourced but shipped from France or fast-fashion sneakers from the store down the street? Cremation or burial? Stay tuned to find out.

When the Graduate Student Government proposed a budget cut for travel grants Monday evening, some senators were unhappy with the proposal. 
One senator argued that travel grants, which allow students to travel to business conferences and present their research projects, are an essential part of any graduate program. 
However, GSG President Joycelyn Yip said that in order to maintain travel funds, GSG needs to increase programming fees, which go to graduate students’ respective departments to fund various programs. 
“If you want to keep travel grants up, this is why we’re proposing a programming fee increase,” Yip said.
Yip proposed a 7.5 percent increase in programming fees for the 2019-20 academic year to offset a stagnant budget over the past 30 years. The discrepancy in fees and rising costs of tuition have resulted in budget cuts of programs meant to support graduate students in their academic endeavors. 
Senate members ultimately approved the programming fee increase by a slight majority. For future programming fees, senate members voted for a 3 percent increase for the 2020-21 academic year.
Next semester, graduate students can expect an increase in programming fees to help support travel grants, emergency fund programs and U-Pass, a reduced fare public transit program. Yip said the changes reflect rising prices across campus.
“We want to catch up with University prices, as well as everything else,” Yip said. 
According to Yip, GSG also wants to shift the burden of funding graduate students’ endeavors back to their respective departments. 
“We want to see departments stepping up to fund their students to travel to conferences and to travel to do the networking necessary to get hired,” said Emmett Harsin Drager, vice president of advocacy for GSG. 
Citing a New York Times article, Drager said capital is one of the main barriers for graduate students of color who are searching for work opportunities.
“We want [travel grants] to be a program that reaches out and touches low-income graduate students and graduate students of color,” they said.
Senate members also voted on a Freedom of Information Bylaw, which aims to publish senators’ contact information so students can contact their representatives.
The Senate also addressed the issue of increasing transparency with the graduate student population.
According to Yip, only major proposals were previously available to the public. 
Members also brought attention to increasing transparency in publicizing the expenditures of GSG and providing information on what events or programs fees supported. 
“There’s a lack of awareness of where the spending is going from the programming fee,” said Sen. Lauren Deaderick. “It’s not necessarily about the dollar amount that will increase.”
GSG approved the Freedom of Information Bylaw with 40 votes and one abstention.
To better proportionally represent graduate students and ensure that their voices are heard, the meeting also covered senate restructuring.
Currently, the proposal aims to limit the number of senators to 50, with about 43 active members and the rest serving as needed. The proposal also aims to restructure the Senate every four to five years based on new data about student distribution across the University’s schools. 
Concerns were raised about Health Science Campus senator representation, because HSC has its own issues separate from the University’s main campus. The next GSG meeting aims to address the issue of representation in greater detail, but members ultimately approved the proposal on senate restructuring.

The Undergraduate Student Government announced candidates for the 2019-20 academic year on Instagram and the USG website on Monday. A single presidential ticket was announced along with 20 senatorial candidates. 
Senators Michaela Murphy and Meagan Lane are running for president and vice president, respectively. 
Their platform focuses on greater campus sustainability and the expansion of community gardens, as well as improving student health conditions and suggesting that the University offer free menstrual products in all campus restrooms.
“Something that was really important for myself and Meagan was running a campaign that was based on integrity and growth,” Murphy said. “We had really ample opportunity to see the places where this campus failed to meet the needs of different students and marginalized communities.”
The pair plans to continue The New York Times subscription program for students, expand access to scholarships and advocate for diversity in the general admission process.
After having met through USG Senate and working together on projects like the USG Diversity Fund, Murphy said they have developed a strong collaborative dynamic.
“There’s no other person that I can imagine managing to keep me sane during the election,” Murphy said. “I’m so proud to know her and have her as a friend.”
Of the candidates running for the 12 open senator positions, Gabriel Savage is the only incumbent. Other candidates include Julian Kuffour, Hailey Robertson, Ben Rosenthal, Laura Pearson, Sarah Ritch, Omar Garcia, Jacob Lind, Jacob Schwessinger, Andrew Fowler, Randi Anderson, Haley Garland, Sara Khoshniyati, Quinn Cunniff, Benjamin Shiff, Christopher Pack, Emily Donahue, Christopher McMorran, Angela Chuang and Emily Johnson. 
Rosenthal, Robertson and Kuffour; Ritch and Garcia; Lind and Schwessinger; Savage, Fowler and Anderson; Garland and Khoshniyati; Donahue and McMorran; and Chuang and Johnson are running on joint platforms.

The Office for Health Promotion Strategy is beginning to “write the narrative” of student health on campus, thanks to new data and strategies that were launched last semester with Collective Impact. 
The Collective Impact plan, led by Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, is a new, cross-sector approach that hopes to reshape the USC community as a whole. Its four strategic goals include: enhancing equity and inclusion, cultivating a culture for communities and individuals to thrive, addressing substance abuse on campus and promoting consent and healthy relationships. Each goal is led by faculty members whose work range from campus-wide meetings to one-on-one conversations with students.  
“[The plan creates] a structure for people from different departments, schools, colleges, to work together on complicated problems in our community,” Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said. 
The Office for Health Promotion Strategy, which serves as the backbone of the Collective Impact plan, surveyed 4,650 students last spring with its USC Healthy Minds Study.
The survey, which sampled undergraduate, graduate and doctoral student populations, found that 25 percent of USC students had moderate to severe depression, with LGBTQ+ students experiencing the highest rate. It also found that 8 percent of USC students have contemplated suicide, with black students experiencing the highest rate at 10 percent. 
“There is a lot of mental health need on campus, like we expected,” Van Orman said. “USC students are not different from the national data set … [but] there’s also a lot of students who are thriving.”  
Van Orman said USC’s new approach makes it one of the only universities in the country to implement the Collective Impact plan. 
“There are not other campuses doing this in this way … we’re excited about this as making us a real leader in the field, ” Van Orman said. 
The results of the survey illustrated trends that the Office for Health Promotion Strategy plans to incorporate into the Collective Impact plan. 
“The data is going to help us a lot,” said Paula Swinford, director of the Office for Health Promotion Strategy. “We have hired somebody to work with our data, so we’re beginning to understand … so that we don’t say things like, ‘All students at USC …’ anymore.” 
The results of a second Healthy Minds Study, which was sent to students last semester, are still being analyzed.
Swinford said she was excited about last semester’s launch of a “Student Well-being Council,” which comprises high-level administrators and a student representative from both the Undergraduate and Graduate student governments. 
“The Student Well-being Council is focused on broadening the collective impact,” Swinford said. “It’s also a way that policies can get discussed and kind of bigger picture considerations and recommendations can be looked at.” 
Swinford said the council is working on streamlining the pre-enrollment curriculum, which educates new students on alcohol and drug use and consensual relationships. 
One aspect of the Collective Impact plan is already in place at the lobby outside the Starbucks at Cafe 84: a self-care vending machine that contains condoms, pregnancy tests, medicine and other supplies that might otherwise be hard for students to access. Carry said the vending machine will be operational within the next two weeks. 
Carry, who announced last month that he will depart from USC in April, said the Collective Impact plan is not dependent on one person or organization. 
“Collective Impact is our collective efforts to do all of the things needed to create a safer campus community for students with regard to particular health issues,” Carry said. “So one person’s exit or entry doesn’t change the Collective Impact effort.” 
A replacement for Carry’s position has not yet been chosen.
Carry also said the results of Collective Impact will not be apparent to the campus community for a while, as many of the goals of the plan are long-term. 
The Office of Health Promotion Strategy is currently recruiting eight paid community health organizers, who Swinford said will be dedicated to different campus populations.
The student organizers will comprise four undergraduate and four graduate students, and will run student focus groups and attend staff meetings on Collective Impact. 
“Collective Impact is a flavor of collaboration and community development,” Swinford said. “We always knew that in order to do this work long term, the students have to be a part of the conversation.”

Marshall School of Business donors and alumni are lashing out at the University’s recent decision to terminate Dean James Ellis in June 2019. 
Poets & Quants, a news site covering graduate business schools, reported that a Marshall development officer said the school may lose an estimated $30 to $40 million in donor support. The Daily Trojan could not independently confirm this statement. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Rachel Morrell, associate dean and chief development officer of Marshall, said the school’s fundraising remains steady. 
“Though the USC Marshall School surpassed its campaign goal of $400 million in December 2017, fundraising at the school remains strong,” Morrell said. “While we measure fundraising progress over the length of a campaign, not in monthly increments or a single point in time, we can say that the current fundraising total for the school is ahead of where we were at this point in time last year.” 
The Board of Trustees announced its support of Interim President Wanda Austin’s decision to terminate Ellis after a December board meeting, despite protest from the Marshall community and a Change.org petition with 2,830 signatures at the time of the decision. The petition now has over 3,650 signatures. 
Ted Kaiser,  a Marshall alumnus from the class of 2005, is considering ending his donations to the University. Kaiser is a USC Athletics Cardinal and Gold donation tier member and pledges $3,000 to the athletic department each year, and also donates funds to Marshall. 
“There’s a lot of people just like me, friends of mine who are kind of in the same boat and kind of the same thing,” Kaiser said. “The Dean Ellis thing was the last straw in … a decade’s worth of missteps.” 
Kaiser said many of his friends told the University that they will not donate to recent Marshall pledge drives. 
“I know several of my friends have canceled season football tickets, they have canceled their Cardinal and Gold memberships,” Kaiser said. “A number of them have been contacted by Marshall recently during their pledge drive and said no, they weren’t going to continue giving this year.” 
George Getz, a Marshall alumnus who currently serves on the Marshall Board of Leaders, said he has been giving money to the University due to Ellis’ contributions to the business school. 
“With the departure of [Ellis and former president C. L. Max Nikias], it has changed my interests in wanting to give money back to the school,” Getz said. 
Getz believes that the lack of transparency and the lack of communication from Austin and the Board of Trustees will lead to a decline in donations to Marshall.
“I think it is going to cost the school tens of millions dollars in donations from people who have known Jim and have supported Jim,” Getz said. “Whether it has been an outstanding pledge or new dollars that they would have given to the school as a result of him being there, with him being terminated, there will be a significant decline in giving.” 
Though Getz would not disclose how much he donates to the University, he describes himself as a “significant” donor to Marshall, the School of Dramatic Arts and the Joint Educational Project.
Lloyd Greif, benefactor of the Lloyd Greif Center of Entrepreneurial Studies, would not disclose his plans for future donations, but said he is not surprised that other alumni and donors have threatened to pull funding from the University. 
“People see [Ellis] as being mistreated here … They see it as an unjust termination,” Greif said. “When people don’t agree with things, they vote. The only way the alumni can vote is to vote with their dollars, because there’s no election here.” 
Dean Hallett, a donor and alumni who also serves as the president of Hallett Leadership, said he finished paying a five-year pledge early in 2018, before news of Ellis’ termination broke. Hallett said he hadn’t planned to make any major donations, but would have pulled funds if he were.
In the past 15 years, Hallett has served on various University boards and donated to scholarships and capital funds at USC. But he said he has lost trust in University administration and would like to see more transparency in how Ellis’ termination was announced.
“Because of how things are being handled, and there’s such a swell of controversy over this whole thing, I think I’d be inclined to pull back because of that,” Hallett said. “I don’t know the truth, so I can’t say it’s because of what action the University is taking, but it’s the way that everything is being handled that is particularly bothersome to me.” 
Greg Autry, an assistant clinical professor at Marshall, said he believes Ellis’ termination and the possible loss in donations will negatively affect students.
“I think it reduces the value of your degree,” Autry said. “I think it’s going to ruin what was a very cohesive culture of Marshall.”

USC community programs working with the Los Angeles Unified School District may face a decrease in the number of participating public school teachers this semester due to the teachers’ strike that began Monday.
Some teachers participating in the School of International Relations’ Teaching International Relations Program and the Joint Educational Program do not plan on signing up this spring because the strike has no set end date.
Gloria Hernandez, a School of Visual Arts and Humanities teacher at Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools, worked with TIRP in the fall, but does not plan to participate in the program this semester.
“It’s really difficult to sign up for TIRP when we don’t have a specific date to say they can come in,” Hernandez said. “I don’t know how far behind we’ll be. We don’t want to strike but [we’re] going to have to.” 
As a part of the USC Center for Active Learning in International Studies, TIRP invites USC students to teach international relations lessons in classrooms registered by local teachers  who sign up for the program.
Nearly 50 percent of the teachers that participate in TIRP are from LAUSD, according to CALIS Director Teresa Hudock.
“The teachers who are not overwhelmed by what’s going on with the strike — we have to make sure we get ahold of them and that they get signed up in the midst of this,”  Hudock said. “We have a way to leave them a message and say we know you’re on strike, but if you get your sign up in we’ll be ready for you when you get back.”  
The strike also affects the JEP service-learning program, which is sponsored by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. JEP places approximately 2,000 students into local schools to mentor, teach and assist students each semester. But students will not be sent to LAUSD schools during the strike, according to Susan Harris, the JEP executive director. 
“If it’s resolved this week, we might not have any delay in our program at all,” Harris said. “It entirely depends on how long this goes on. If it goes on, we will try to plan other kinds of activities and we’ll send students to schools that aren’t unionized.” 
United Teachers Los Angeles, the union negotiating with LAUSD, rejected the district’s latest offer Friday. On Monday, nearly 32,000 LAUSD teachers took to the picket line.
The UTLA strike is asking for the school district to increase wages for teachers, hire greater support staff and lower the average classroom size. Schools with teachers joining the strike have gathered students into auditoriums for the duration of the school day, according Teresa Hudock. 
Despite challenges, TIRP remains optimistic about gaining enough LAUSD teachers to sign up. 
“I just had a principal cc me on an email to every single one of her department heads requiring all of them to sign up,” said Markus Sherman, CALIS office program coordinator. “Things are still moving on a normal pace but it’s definitely this kind of looming bubble right now.” 
Sherman said that interactions between TIRP and LAUSD teachers have been hopeful. JEP is able to send its students to non-LAUSD partners, including parochial and nonprofit organizations, if the strike persists for long period of time.
“I can definitely see [the strike] affecting students, not only the students in the classrooms but also the JEP volunteers,” said Kaela Gallagher, a freshman majoring in business administration who volunteered in the JEP House last semester.  
Student volunteers who are in the program work with teachers to schedule and plan sessions.
“My teacher was super important in everything that we did in the classroom,” Gallagher said. “Effective communication and being able to rely on her was really important for us to do what we need to do. I can see that causing a lot of complications for the JEP volunteers.”

Freshman guard Kevin Porter has been suspended indefinitely from the men’s basketball team by head coach Andy Enfield due to conduct issues.
As Enfield and staff members decide on the appropriate level of punishment for Porter, the next few days are pivotal for both Porter and the Trojans’ basketball season as a whole.
“We’ll reevaluate his future with the program this week,” Enfield said.
The nature of Enfield’s announcement prompts speculation over whether or not Thursday’s loss to Oregon State would be the last time Trojan fans get to see the five-star guard. Some of the speculation over Porter’s status with the team is due to the parallels between his situation and that of sophomore guard Jordan Usher. After being suspended indefinitely for conduct issues, Usher announced his transfer the next day and now attends Georgia Tech.
Another factor in the speculation is the high draft stock Porter has garnered, despite limited time on the court. Bleacher Report has projected that the 6-foot-6 guard will go as high as third overall and ESPN has him as a lottery talent, ranking him as the 11th overall prospect.
If Thursday was the last of Porter at USC, his Trojan career will have ended with just four appearances. However, the freshman doesn’t see his tenure as a Trojan coming to an end just yet.
“There has been speculation that I will no longer finish the season as a Trojan, those accusation and what has brought a lot of negative attention to the Trojan family are all false. I am a Trojan and never once have been put in a predicament from our coaching staff that I was removed and wasn’t a part of this program,” Porter tweeted.
As Porter’s status remains up in the air, the Trojans prepare to host UCLA Saturday at 1 p.m. at  the Galen Center.

Two batons float down from 20 feet in the air and hit the grass after flying in and out of USC twirler Emily Tutnick’s hands for a solid minute while the Trojan Marching Band plays “Tribute to Troy” in the background. She grabs the last baton before it hits the ground and wraps up her routine with a spin and a bow, as if the drops were all planned. 
Tutnick walks to her coach, Liane Aramaki, breathing heavily with the same natural smile she keeps on her face while performing. Aramaki hands her a water bottle and a towel, which Tutnick accepts with the fierce intensity of a fighter between rounds. 
It’s a typical Tuesday evening band practice at Cromwell Field, and Tutnick, now a sophomore, is preparing for USC’s homecoming football game, where she will entertain tens of thousands of fans before kickoff and during halftime. After eight years of field and competitive twirling, she sees the Coliseum stage as the peak of her twirling career. 
Becoming the USC twirler
During her senior year of high school, Tutnick applied to USC with dreams of twirling for the Trojan Marching Band. When she didn’t get in, she attended Arizona State to focus on academics with her sights still set on being a Trojan. 
“[ASU] was a stepping stone for me to come to USC,” Tutnick said. 
Having built a relationship with the marching band during recruitment, she reached out when she received her acceptance to transfer to USC as an international relations global business major, after one year at ASU.
But Tutnick still needed to try out. She showed up to Brittingham Field one day over the summer and performed in front of the marching band. Keeping in line with its culture, the decision was up to the student members.
“[The band] is really student-oriented, which is cool,” Tutnick said. “But it was really nerve-wracking being judged by [my] peers.”
The band members erupted into cheers as Tutnick bowed to close her tryout performance. Eight years of twirling experience had led to this moment. 
Tutnick started as a gymnast when she was just two-years-old, but she stuck with the sport for 10 years. She always thought her tumbling skills would carry her into high school cheerleading until her mother didn’t want her to. They decided to find another way for her to represent her school, and Tutnick fell in love with twirling while in a small baton class in Phoenix. 
“Emily started twirling at a much older age than a lot of her competitors, and she was very adamant in being able to compete at the elite level in a very short time,” Aramaki said. “She had also once said that she would be the featured twirler for the USC Trojan Marching Band, and she would do whatever it took to get there.”
Fans and alumni come up to Tutnick at rallies and voice their satisfaction in finally having a twirler back in the marching band. Up until 2013, the Trojan Marching Band had one to  four twirlers each year. However, the last five years saw a blank space on the field where Tutnick now stands with her gold attire reflecting the Coliseum lights amidst a sea of red when the band formation spells out “Trojans.”
Achieving her goal of twirling for USC hasn’t slowed down Tutnick’s mental and physical preparation.
Twirler mentality 
As many professional baseball players do by hitting off a tee to start practice, Tutnick begins practices by rehearsing the most fundamental skills of twirling before getting to the flashy, “big” tricks. 
“When you play basketball and you dribble the ball, you dribble every single day,” Tutnick said. “It’s a basic level skill. I do that too, but just with twirling.”
Tutnick spends upwards of 20 hours per week on perfecting her craft. At practice, she typically focuses on set routines that she will use in competition, rather than on the field. In competitions, twirlers are deducted points for mistakes, so she must stick to a set routine. 
“[Tutnick is] an athlete who loves to perform [and] works diligently to perfect the skills of her sport,” Aramaki said.
Although many aspects are similar between the two settings in which she performs, Tutnick engages in a different mindset during a performance at a USC football game in front of the roaring crowd of the Coliseum. 
“Field twirling is different because I have creative freedom, so I get to have fun,” Tutnick said.
Though she strives for perfection in every aspect of her routine, mistakes happen. To Tutnick, it doesn’t matter how she falls, but rather how she gets up.  
“If I drop [the baton] on the field, I will attempt to make it look like I did it on purpose rather than just looking at it and picking it up and moving on,” Tutnick said.
Gameday 
Before fans even consider rolling out of bed and sporting their USC attire on gameday, Tutnick is already hard at work with the Trojan Marching Band. Practice starts at 6:30 a.m. before getting into the various festivities of the day. 
While the Spirit of Troy has a packed day with many performances, Tutnick’s favorite aspect of the bands pregame rituals is the march to the Coliseum. The band walks through campus on its way to the game blaring popular Trojan classics including “Tribute to Troy” and “Fight On.” 
“That’s probably one of my favorite parts, seeing everybody getting hyped up and tailgating and having a really good time before the game starts,” she said.
Tutnick and the band perform for the majority of the day and don’t get to relax until after the postgame concert — which, as Tutnick attests, is much more enjoyable when USC wins. The band gathers around the student section and triumphantly plays songs that the crowd wants to hear. Without fail, the band plays the alma mater and “Fight Song,” but this time allows for the band to incorporate popular songs like “Heartbreaker.”
All of this makes for a long Saturday, but Tutnick wouldn’t have it any other way.
“The night games can be like 17 hours,” Tutnick said. “It’s really long, but I have so much fun, so it’s all worth it.”
Being the USC twirler
While Tutnick is proud to twirl for her school, she sees a greater need to represent other twirlers. 
USC has a reputation in the twirling community for being extremely hard to get into and the band has no way of pulling applications through. USC is seen as a far reach and many twirlers are discouraged from applying. Tutnick didn’t want it to stay that way. 
“Coming to USC was not only because I wanted to,” she said. “It’s because it’s good for the community, and it creates this image that another twirler can come in after me.” 
Tutnick wants the little 10-year old girls who slick their hair back in tight buns and spend hours juggling batons to set their goals and accomplish them — just like she did. 
“I really want younger girls that see us as college university twirlers to be able to say ‘I wanna go there’ or ‘I wanna be like [her],” Tutnick said.

The Trojans traveled to Honolulu over the weekend, kicking off their 50th season with two victories and one loss at the Hawaiian Airlines Rainbow Warrior Classic. 
Because it was the first tournament of the season, the Trojans focused on team building. Senior libero Matt Douglas said the weekend was an opportunity for upperclassmen to teach their younger teammates “how to conduct business on and off the court.” 
Beyond that, the Trojans spent a lot of time in the week leading up to the tournament scouting their opponents and preparing accordingly. When it came time to execute, coaches emphasized that the team’s effort would pay off.
“We worked extremely hard all off-season and all preseason, so they let us know that we were ready to go, we deserved to be out there and to give it all we have,” Douglas said.
The tournament began on Thursday with a 3-0 victory over the Concordia University Eagles. Redshirt senior captain Jack Wyett and senior captain Gianluca Grasso led the offense with 15 and 10 kills, respectively. Senior outside hitter Ryan Moss and redshirt sophomore setter Matt Faraimo contributed eight and seven kills, respectively. 
The Trojans maintained strong leads in each of the three sets against the Eagles with scores of 25-14, 25-18, 25-14. USC will see Concordia again later in the season in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play. 
The momentum continued on Friday as the Trojans defeated the New Jersey Institute Highlanders 3-1 in a 25-17, 24-26, 25-23, 25-15 match. Moss led the offense with 15 kills and contributed significantly on defense with eight digs and four blocks. Sophomore setter Chris Hall and sophomore libero Cole Paxson each had nine digs of their own.
Despite wins on Thursday and Friday, USC fell to No. 4 Hawaii on Saturday in a 12-25, 23-25, 16-25 match. Junior opposite Rado Parapunov and senior outside hitter/opposite Stijn Van Tilburg led the Warriors with 16 and 15 kills, respectively. 
Despite the loss, Douglas said he thought the team did well facing a hostile crowd.
“I thought we did a good job sticking together in a foreign environment with not many fans rooting for us,” he said. “We had to really galvanize, make sure we were there for each other and be engaged the whole time.”
Grasso led the Trojan offense with 10 kills and two aces, while Douglas led the defense with 11 digs. USC put up a strong fight throughout the match and managed to pick up a 10-9 lead in the second set. The Warriors pulled ahead again before the Trojans narrowed the margin back to 23-22, but ultimately let it slip to a 25-23 set. 
“When you’re in an environment like that with thousands of people, you can get the jitters a little bit, and that was our first real test of the year,” Douglas said. “They were really good. I don’t think we were able to match their level of execution, but it was the first tournament of the season, and we have a long way to go.” 
The Trojans are now 2-1 for the season. They will travel to Lebanon, Tenn., this weekend to compete in the Off The Block Grow the Game Challenge. On Friday, they take on Lincoln Memorial at 5 p.m. PST.  On Saturday, they will face Barton at 2:30 p.m. PST. On Sunday, they play Lindenwood at 2:30 p.m. PST. All games will be available to stream on the Cumberland Sports Network.

Pac-12 men’s basketball has come to a low point, facing the possibility of being the first Power 5 conference to have just one bid in the NCAA tournament. Injuries have wrecked teams like Oregon, who lost star freshman center and likely top-five pick Bol Bol to a season-ending foot injury. Arizona, a conference powerhouse this millenium, lost a number of recruits to the FBI investigation surrounding them, among other teams. 
No team in the conference has had the talent and production to separate themselves from the pack as an elite team in college basketball, as each program has at least four losses already this season.
But that is what makes USC basketball’s struggles so baffling. The Trojans are 9-8 on the season and 2-2 in conference play, having been the living embodiment of average since the season tipped off. Every time they seem to have momentum, they flop. After winning four straight games, including their first two conference contests, they’ve dropped their last two, including a dismal 81-60 loss at Oregon on Sunday. The Pac-12 is there for the taking if USC could just hang around, but right now it doesn’t look capable of hanging with the better teams in the conference.
The Trojans have too much experience and ability to already be lagging behind in a truly mediocre conference. Their entire starting five is made up of upperclassmen with good pedigree. Rakocevic and Mathews, along with senior forward Bennie Boatwright and redshirt senior guard Shaqquan Aaron, saw significant minutes for last year’s squad that went 24-12, finished second in the conference and made it to the conference championship game.
In addition, redshirt junior guard Derryck Thornton was so highly regarded coming out of high school that he went to Duke, one of the highest ranked programs for decades, before transferring to USC in 2016. This team has significant talent, but it simply hasn’t been able to put it all together.
To be fair, USC has had to deal with key players missing time from the jump. Injuries took their toll from the preseason on, as freshmen guards Kevin Porter and Elijah Weaver have both missed multiple games. Boatwright also started the season hampered by a knee that was still recovering from offseason surgery.
However, injuries are not an excuse, because other teams in the Pac-12 have dealt with similar, or worse, adversity. They should have been able to compete with the Ducks, especially with Bol out, and they lost to Oregon State, despite the Beavers’ leading scorer, redshirt junior forward Tres Tinkle, missing the game due to injury.
It’s hard to see things improving now that the trademark USC sports dysfunction has fallen on the team. Sophomore forward Jordan Usher transferred to Georgia State last week after being suspended indefinitely. Now Porter, the team’s most talented player and a definite lottery pick in June’s NBA Draft, has been suspended indefinitely and was absent for the loss to Oregon. Head coach Andy Enfield said Porter was suspended for “conduct issues” and that his future with the program would be re-evaluated this week.
If Porter is lost for the season, the Trojans lose all hope for finding that much-needed identity. Fans saw Porter’s dazzling offensive talent before the season and hoped that his scoring ability could carry a Trojan team somewhat lacking in shot-creators. But from injuries that kept him off the court to freshman mistakes which limited his impact between the lines, Porter was never able to become that crucial go-to guy for USC. Now, he may never get his chance.
Enfield has done a good job bringing the Trojans to prominence since taking over in 2013. He improved the program’s recruiting to the point that it currently has the second best 2019 class in the nation, trailing only Arizona. The Trojans won at least 21 games in each of the previous three seasons, heightening discourse about the basketball team at a definite football school.
But with better results come higher expectations. Perhaps the team will improve drastically next year with better injury luck and an even more talented class of freshmen than the Trojans welcomed this season. But the current iteration of the team is undeniably underperforming; for USC fans looking at a wide open Pac-12, it has to be a gut punch that their team hasn’t been able to take advantage.

2019 is looking to be an exciting year for movies. Highly recognized franchises will release important installments (“Avengers: Endgame” and “Star Wars: Episode IX”) while big-name directors will showcase their new, exciting projects (Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and Jordan Peele’s “Us”). Amid these giant releases, however, will be smaller, more obscure films that may fly under the public’s radar due to poor distribution or lack of word of mouth. Regardless, these five indie and arthouse films are worth checking out this coming year.
Climax
Release Date: March 1
Gaspar Noé has built up a reputation as a fascinating, albeit divisive, director. His movies deal with unsettling topics like out-of-body experiences, but he adds strong artistic merit to his films, his fifth movie “Climax” may be no different. The story about a group of French dancers facing horrific circumstances after drinking sangria spiked with LSD seems nightmare-inducing. Noé’s track record suggests he’ll find ways to have audience members truly feel the characters’ torment and render them deeply disturbed long after the credits roll. Aside from Sofia Boutella, “Climax” stars mostly non-actors, which may add a level of authenticity not seen in mainstream movies. 
Parasite
Release date: TBD
Bong Joon-ho has become one of South Korea’s most acclaimed modern directors. In terms of the American market, however, the only movies he’s directed that have received public attention are the co-production “Snowpiercer” starring Chris Evans and the Netflix-produced “Okja.” In 2019, the director will return to his original South Korean roots with “Parasite.” Co-directed by Joon-ho and starring his frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho, the film follows a man who is affected in unforeseen ways after getting infected with a parasite. Typically, foreign films have a poor distribution in American theaters. However, given the previous reception of “Snowpiercer” and “Okja,” perhaps more people will feel more compelled to seek out “Parasite” at their nearest theater when it’s released.
Ms. Purple
Release Date: TBD
Indie movies are rarely expected to achieve much success; Justin Chon’s “Gook,” however, did not even meet this low expectation, making only $250,000 domestically. As a result, not as many people saw Chon’s prowess as a first-time director. Yet, it seems like the honesty and poignance that he captured in “Gook” will carry over to his new film, “Ms. Purple.” The film follows two siblings in Koreatown trying to mend their relationship during their father’s final days. Even though artistic integrity is important in a film, financial success helps directors reach larger audiences. With this year’s release, Chon may be able to  start accumulating a larger fanbase who will continue to advocate for his work. As such, “Ms. Purple” will likely be worth watching, no matter how far away the closest theater playing the film is.
I’m Thinking of Ending Things
Release Date: TBD
Nearly everything screenwriter/director Charlie Kaufman has touched has become pure gold. Movies like “Adaptation” and “Anomalisa” are original and emotional, but they rarely receive any attention from the general public. With his next movie, however, Kaufman has some leverage that may help his work become better known to a wider audience. “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” is his first collaboration with Netflix. This will likely give Kaufman the creative liberty and exposure he needs. Furthermore, it will star Brie Larson and Jesse Plemons — their dramatic performances in “Room” and “Breaking Bad,” respectively, will certainly attract viewers. With Kaufman as the writer and director, both actors will certainly be pushed beyond their limits to craft another exceptional addition to Kaufman’s legacy.
Guava Island
Release Date: TBD
The first glimpse of “Guava Island” came last August when a photo of Rihanna and Donald Glover in Cuba was suddenly leaked online, sparking rumors and speculations. On Nov.  24, at Glover’s PHAROS Festival in Auckland, New Zealand, the project was confirmed to be “Guava Island,” and the movie’s first trailer was shown exclusively at that festival. While there has not been any other information officially published, aside from Letitia Wright’s supporting role, IMDb indicates that the film is currently in post-production. Because this movie seems to be a moderately-budgeted comedic drama, it is highly likely to see a 2019 release. If this is the case, this seemingly indie flick may turn into a giant hit as Glover and director Hiro Murai reaffirm their strong influence on the entertainment industry.

2018 was an eclectic year for movies. It graced audiences with everything from a lovable British bear (“Paddington 2”) to arguably the most disturbing horror film in recent memory (“Hereditary”). Needless to say,  there were many divisive projects in the plethora of releases — films like “Vice” and “Green Book” received backlash for their questionable and highly dramatized portrayals of historical figures.
What fascinated me the most about this year, however, was not the political disputes behind these movies so much as the gaping chasm between the critiques of an average moviegoer and those of a film critic. The phenomenon repeated itself throughout 2018 — time and time again, we saw critics and audiences differ greatly in their respective opinions on a film. 
The most interesting examples of this gap came in the form of two very different movies, which produced very different effects on audiences and critics: “Venom” and “Bohemian Rhapsody.” 
“Venom,” released the same week as “A Star is Born,” demolished all competition at the box office; it quickly became a massive hit despite rampant criticism. When all was said and done, “Venom” emerged with a whopping 28 percent “rotten” critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes. 
Just across from the critics’ score on the site, you’ll see what looks like a discrepancy in the audience’s take on the film: 84 percent, “fresh.” Arguably the best movie of the entire year, “Roma”, has an 83 percent audience score. 
Rotten Tomatoes’ Twitter account quickly took advantage of the situation with tweets displaying the two vastly different scores, captioned: “Who do you trust? The audience or the critics?” It’s a harrowing question that asks us to choose between two disparate movie-watching philosophies. It implies that one side is having fun while the other is coldly, heartlessly (maybe even pretentiously) analyzing a film’s technical elements. 
Soon after “Venom,” the battle for cinema’s soul found a new fight in the Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Metacritic, a website that creates a composite score out of 100 from film critics everywhere, gave it a dismal 48. 
However, it was studded with Queen songs. And it featured actors who looked just like Queen members performing those songs. That was more than enough for the audience because, according to IMDb, their score (8.4/10) has placed it at No. 136 in the top 250 movies of all time. 
To put that score in perspective, according to IMDb’s user scores, “Bohemian Rhapsody” ranks above three directors’ most acclaimed films: “Fargo” (the Coen Brothers, #165), “Jurassic Park” (Steven Spielberg, #183) and, of course, “Roma” (Alfonso Cuaron, #238). 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” is a stranger case than “Venom”; for the latter, much of the public admitted it was “so bad, it was good.” On the other hand, Queen’s biopic received genuine praise from fans even as it garnered scathing reviews from critics. Depending on what side spoke louder, “Bohemian Rhapsody” was either very good or very bad. 
Part of what makes a film good — arguably something both camps agree on — is how immersive the experience is. Movies are mostly critiqued in relation to how much they take the viewer out of the experience by making it clear that they are watching a fabricated product. For example, “bad dialogue” is only bad because it was clearly scripted and is not something a character would naturally say (which, consequently, is “good” dialogue). 
When a movie like “Bohemian Rhapsody” is (literally) playing to its audience’s demands — giving them a clean-cut version of the Queen tale with a healthy dose of (admittedly well-made) concert scenes — it abandons faithfulness to the actual Queen story just to give its audience a lightly dramatic, mildly heartwarming tale. With every cardboard scene, every poorly-defined character trait and clumsy continuity, “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Venom” repeatedly take the attentive critic out of the experience of watching a story organically unfold; it becomes obvious that this was mostly fabricated to meet the public’s demands.
But right next to the pensive critic sits a wide-eyed Queen fan; they don’t care if these scenarios have been fabricated, only about how great it was that the bass line from “Another One Bites the Dust” settled a band argument, even if that’s far from the truth. On the surface, “Bohemian Rhapsody” is a very fun watch, and, unlike “Roma,” is very superficial, not requiring audiences to probe the depths of the universal questions it may or may not be asking. Critics like to probe the worldview behind every frame and line of dialogue; in my experience, most casual viewers can do without. 
There’s no right or wrong way to watch a movie. On one end, films are primarily a vehicle for entertainment, so judging a film’s quality based on how entertaining it was on its surface is completely valid. Nevertheless, movies are decidedly an art form, and, as all art, there is an unspoken but agreed upon, standard to determine its quality. Both criteria are valid when watching a movie; now we just have to find a middle ground.

A missing persons case in the eerie rural South, a harrowing journey across three time periods and troubled detectives with difficult pasts: “True Detective” season 3 goes back to the same dark formula that made the first season such a hit. 
The newest release in the anthology series follows state detective Wayne Hays, a Vietnam War veteran, through the course of 35 years and three different timelines as he tries to solve the case of two missing children in the Ozarks region of Arkansas. Brought to life by the exceptional Mahershala Ali, Detective Hays finds his mental state slowly deteriorating, creating a visual narrative that’s as much a puzzle to us as to the protagonist himself. 
Coming into season 3, “True Detective” and its auteur creator, Nic Pizzolatto, had much to prove. After a masterpiece debut season that featured stellar performances from both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, the second season paled in comparison. On Sunday, Academy Award-winner Ali took the lead after nearly four years. So, does the premiere live up to the hype? Well, in short, yes. 
Pizzolatto once again creates a rich atmospheric landscape which entices the audience yet instills a constant fear of what secrets might lie beneath its veneer. Jeremy Saulnier deftly directs the two episodes with a fractured framework that mirrors the protagonist’s own mental state through stellar cinematography and production design. 
Ali gives another captivating and human performance as Officer Hays. Shown across three distinct timelines, each version of the character is different and encounters new demons. Ali makes each version of Hays feel separate and the same at once. In supporting roles, Scoot McNairy steals his scenes as Tom, a broken father of two missing children, while Carmen Ejogo also gives a solid outing as the empathetic schoolteacher Amelia. 
It’s fascinating to behold Ali’s stellar performance as Hays in present day, as a 70-year-old man tormented by his past. A huge part of that is due to the amazing hairstyle and make-up he dons. It may be some of the most realistic aging makeup ever put on screen. And with Ali’s physical acting, it is truly incredible.
However, while the show’s writing is its strongest aspect, it can also be its weakest at certain points. The story sometimes feels forcefully jumbled in its shifting timelines and the clear similarities between the first and third season are sometimes too obvious. It feels like after a lackluster sophomore effort, Pizzolatto played it too safe by employing all his old tricks, but holding back on any new ones. 
While the familiarity of the premiere disappointed, the return to form is still exciting. There are glints in the show hinting at new and unexplored secrets. If the show manages to deviate from its formula and deliver more surprises this season, it could be a really wild ride. 
The much-improved third season of “True Detective” starts off with much intrigue and mystery. However, its familiar tactics lose some of the show’s novelty along the way.

In theory, USC Hospitality strives to provide healthy cuisine and elevate “culinary strategy as a nutritional advantage,” according to its website. And to meet its food philosophy, one of its strategies is to “focus on fruits and vegetables first with great diversity across all meals periods and snacks.”
In reality, however,vegetables are hardly prioritized in USC dining hall breakfast menus, if present at all. The only dining hall to regularly offer vegetables during breakfast is Parkside Restaurant and Grill, which mostly uses vegetables for omelet fillings. Even then, frying vegetables into an omelet not only adds fat and calories, but also renders them inaccessible to students with egg allergies or similar dietary restrictions. 
While all dining halls serve vegetables during other meals, breakfast is the most important. It is the first source of energy for many students. USC’s breakfast dining menus have daily offerings of waffles, eggs and variations on breakfast meats as well as several other rotating dishes. However, vegetables fail to make an appearance every day.
USC dining halls’ continual lack of vegetable options in its breakfast menus is a missed opportunity to promote healthy eating. Given that many Americans — and by extension, USC students — struggle to meet dietary requirements, the dining halls’ failure to focus on vegetables first has far-ranging implications on students’ nutrition and performance in the classroom.
For a menu whose selections resemble the classic American breakfast, vegetable options may be a strange proposition. Vegetables, however, are normal breakfast items worldwide. China, India and South Korea — the three most represented countries among international students at USC — all feature vegetables in breakfast dishes from their respective ethnic cuisines.
Given that USC prides itself in being a global university, it is unreasonable for dining halls to limit their menu selection to a single culture’s food preferences. Other cuisines are represented at other meal times, but breakfast sorely lacks cultural diversity. The University has much to learn from foreign cuisines, and the dining halls can take a positive step forward by introducing those cuisines’ vegetable-heavy dishes.
If anything, maintaining familiar customs is far less important than empowering students to develop healthy eating patterns. The 2015-20 Dietary Guidelines for Americans specify that “higher intakes of vegetables … consistently have been identified as characteristics of healthy eating patterns.” The MyPlate model similarly recommends that the average person eat two-and-a-half to three cups of vegetables a day.
Following these dietary recommendations usually leads to positive health outcomes. The Dietary Guidelines reports that an association exists between healthy eating patterns and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, several types of cancer and obesity. The more vegetables a student eats, the more likely they are to lead a healthy lifestyle.
To facilitate healthy eating patterns, the dining halls must offer a greater quantity and variety of vegetables during breakfast. They could incorporate dishes from other cultures, like Korean doenjang-jigae, a soybean paste soup, and Indian uttapam, a thick pancake with vegetable toppings. Increasing the number of opportunities to eat vegetables increases the likelihood that they will meet the MyPlate model’s three-cup quota. Vegetables also provide high amounts of potassium, fiber and other important nutrients as well as a low-calorie alternative to traditional American breakfast items.
Likewise, limited opportunities to consume vegetables often leads to poor health, which poses major economic consequences. The National League of Cities estimates that addressing obesity alone costs the United States over $190 billion, and these costs are likely to grow with the increasing obesity rates. Individual students’ health collectively take their toll on the entire USC community, even those in good health.
In addition, a wealth of evidence exists linking dietary behaviors and academic achievement. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that an association exists between the lack of adequate consumption of specific foods — such as vegetables — and lower grades. Without the nutrients that vegetables provide, alertness, problem-solving and cognitive performance  all suffer.
Inadequate vegetable consumption ultimately hinders USC students from fully engaging in the learning process and limits their potential to process useful skills and knowledge. If severe enough, this could affect the academic prowess integral to USC’s reputation.
 USC dining halls should incorporate vegetables into their breakfast menus, whether it be through introducing foreign dishes or even adding a breakfast salad bar. Any choice promoting vegetable consumption will elevate the dining halls’ culinary strategy.

Type in three letters — “U,” “S” and “C” — into a Google search and the vast majority of the search results will lead you to something related to the University of Southern California. If someone talks about USC within California, people will certainly assume they are referring to the university in Los Angeles. But the farther east someone travels, the more likely those same three letters come to refer to a different college: the University of South Carolina. 
For those who believe the University of South Carolina is the rightful owner of the abbreviated title “USC,”  I’m sorry to say they are simply wrong. The USC of Los Angeles has triumphed in ownership of its name. 
The University of South Carolina decided last week that it will no longer compete with the University of Southern California for the naming rights to “USC.” The South Carolina college rebranded its school logo under the new acronym “UofSC.” 
The rebrand costed a lump sum of $238,000 on research and design, according to University of South Carolina spokesperson Wes Hickman. However, the UofSC community has not been the most receptive to the changes. 
South Carolina previously tried using an interlocked “SC” on its baseball caps, but the Trojans sued and won in 2010. Notably — and hilariously — in commenting on our victory in the trademark case, USC’s lawyer Scott Edelman told the Los Angeles Times the letters deserved to be linked to the Trojans rather than “a goofy little chicken,” referring to South Carolina’s mascot, the gamecock. 
UofSC may think it was the first to coin the abbreviation “USC” because the university was founded 79 years before USC, but UofSC’s original name was South Carolina College. It only became the flagship school of South Carolina public school system when it was implemented in the 1950s. By then, the University of Southern California was already well established. 
A simple Google Trends analysis reveals that when people search for “UofSC,” they almost always are searching for the South Carolina school — most of the searches also come from South Carolina and other states in the South. When it comes to “USC,” the results are more complicated. 
Sure, the highest concentration, proportionally, of USC searches come from South Carolina, but this is simply because there are more people living in California, and the searches compared to the population is much lower. In fact, the county of Los Angeles alone has double the population of the entire state of South Carolina, so the concentration of “USC” searches is naturally lower in a more populous area. 
The clearest indicator of what “USC” really means to people around the country is what links they click on when making these searches. The top related searches people make after a search for “USC” all have to do with Trojan football. This makes it abundantly clear that USC more often referring to the Los Angeles university.  
Thanks to Google search data, the court’s previous trademark ruling and the rebranding from last week, USC can respond to UofSC with its Latin motto, “Palmam qui meruit ferat,” or in English, “Let whoever earns the palm, bear it.” 
We’ve certainly earned it. After all, it’s not really a competition. But if it were, we would be the clear victors. Fight on.
