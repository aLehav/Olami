Former USC tailback Stafon Johnson will file a lawsuit against USC 16 months after suffering a severe throat injury during a weightlifting accident, according to Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times.
Johnson’s attorney has called a press conference for Monday to announce the filing of a personal injury lawsuit against the school.
In September of 2009, Johnson dropped a barrel on himself while bench pressing in USC’s weight room, causing serious injuries to his throat and forcing him to be hospitalized for approximately three weeks. He missed the remainder of the season.
The Los Angeles native was signed as a free agent by the Tennessee Titans following last April’s NFL Draft, but an ankle injury sustained in a preseason game, ended his rookie season. He was relegated to the practice squad as a result.
I am convinced after that this idiot would screw his mother if there is a dime in it for him.   What a shit-head!
Is this idiot related to the other idot Reggie Bunch?  This shows that the apple does  not fall far from the STUPID TREE.   
     BAR THIS IDOT FROM USC FOREVER!   ‘SC HAS TO TEACH THESE IDIOTS THERE IS PRICE FOR STUPIDITY.
And he actually went got into USC?   Obviously he was not much of a scholar!  What a true idiot.   I think the dumbell had the barbell fall on his head not his neck!   Idiot!   
    USC GIVE THIS IDOT THE BOOT!!!
I believe Stafon is a good kid but I believe, being young and naive, he is a victim. Someone close to him, whether a lawyer or family, probably convinced him to sue, as his NFL career looks dubious at best, and he, being young, is probably worried about his future. It’s easy to get to someone when they are anxious and desperate. 
In reality, Stafon has no case against USC. USC did not force him to lift the weight, nor could they have done anything to prevent it. He had a spotter, but the incident happened so quickly (weight slipped from his hand and fell on his neck), that, unless the spotter was psychic or had superpower reflexes, he wouldn’t have been able to stop the weight from falling on Stafon’s neck. 
It was an unfortunate accident, but things like this happen in life. It doesn’t always go as we planned. That does not give one the right to take from others, especially from an institution who has treated Stafon like family and provided nothing but the best for him. 
I think whoever convinced Stafon that this is a good idea is greedy and should be ashamed of themselves. I am sure if Stafon was in financial trouble, simply asking for help from USC would have resulted in an action. Suing USC for life’s lemons is beyond disgraceful.
But, if Mr. Johnson wasn’t part of USC football…he wouldn’t get the time of day from NFL scouts. You can’t bite the hand that feeds you. Take your lumps and man up. Look at Mark Sanchez and Clay Matthews, they’re doing awesome in the NFL. They makin’ dat chedda too. Where’s Reggie Bush at? oh yeah, he’s sidelined by injuries. 
Go NY Jets!!!
you guys are ingnorant. Just because he is sueing isnt because he hasnt had the great opporunity in the NFL yet. He will do awesome in time, but currently he has extremely bad bills and collections coming for him. What would you have him do, he needs to press a lawsuit to get promissary notes to pay for dr. bills that are taking him to collections. grow up and stop being so hurt because someone is trying to stay afloat, not because an extremely wealthy school is being rightfully sued. 
Anon, you a moron, and that you wish hurt on others only shows how pathetic you are.
Sam, way to think the worst of people. You show real class.
They are not being rightfully sued. This is a frivolous lawsuit based on, “I need the money and will get it in any way I can.” 
The last time I checked, it is not a crime to be wealthy in this country, and being wealthy does not mean you should be sued. Just because you can afford the check does not mean you are entitled to sign it. USC covered all of Johnson’s medical expenses until he made his full (note, full) recovery. Add that on to the fact that USC gave him the opportunity to get a free education at a top private school, and gave him exposure which landed him his NFL position…that is more than enough.
Life is not always fair. But that does not give you the right to steal or bully others into making your life easier.
Look, Stafon, Jr, society, USC, does not owe this moron anything.   When will this fool take responsibility for his stupidity?   He is lucky he still has a “brain.”    
   The lesson from this lawsuit is that ‘SC has to learn to pick players, with a little brains, just a little, even an ounce would do.  Look at the “Empty cavity in the head” Reggie Bunch and this idiot “No Cavity.”   I think this moron has been playing football far too long without a helmet.
He has to sue USC in order yo get the insurance company to pay his medical bills and other bills incurred as a result of the accident.  He’s not after SC. The insurance company is messing with Stafon and his family. Busiiness as usual when you’re insured by a “botom line” oriented company.   Happens all the time.
Too bad, and it would not be happening if Stafon was looking at a successful NFL career. But, he is not. Might as well get a few bucks off USC, if he can, right?  That is certainly today’s culture.  USC has insurance for this type of thing, and while I am not sure that USC was negligent in any way, USC and their insurance will likely reach a quick settlement with Stafon. Not cool to sue your “family”, but it’s really no skin off USC’s back win or lose. Jason Street anybody?
a settlement should have already been made if usc was at fault in anyway…
So, it was only USC’s fault now that he isn’t making bank in the NFL.  What a spoiled, ungrateful child.
The average NFL player’s career is 3 years. It’s a high-impact sport that entails a lot of moderate to serious injuries. That’s why NFL rookies who actually play, get paid the kind of bank they do. And after a few years, they’re like dilapidated race horses with no more giddy up.
Just want to show support for Stafon.  I know a lot of people will hate on him for sue-ing the school, but just because we are SC fans or alums, doesn’t mean he is sue-ing us.  If there was negligence on behalf of the school, he deserves damages.  If not, he wont get them, its a wonderful system.  It doesn’t mean he isn’t a trojan.
Look Paco, Stafon his wearing a trojan on his brain and he can’t breath!
Sounds like one of those “honest” personal injury attorneys has gotten to him.
Oh Stafon. Bad move. From Trojan to Nojan in a blink.
Bad news is, he probably wins in a settlement.
The guy drops the weight on himself and the entire school and football team shows an incredible amount of support for him.
And he sues us… what a prick. I hope he sprains his other ankle and has a short lived NFL career.

Five-star offensive tackle prospect Cyrus Kouandjio (Hyattsville, Maryland), the nation’s top-ranked tackle, is no longer considering USC, according to a report from the popular recruiting outlet Rivals.com.
Kouandjio, who has already officially visited Alabama and New Mexico, has decided not to take an official visit to USC, opting instead to visit Iowa and Auburn.
“I am taking the SAT on Saturday morning then flying out to visit Iowa,” Kouandjio told Shane Youngblood of BamaOnLine.com. “I will visit Auburn with my last visit. They have both been recruiting me pretty hard. Auburn has come on pretty late, but I am going to check them out. I don’t think I will be visiting USC. I don’t think I will have the time to do it.”
The Maryland native, who will not make a decision until National Signing Day on Feb. 2, has reportedly narrowed his choices to four schools. USC, however, is not included on his short list.
“Right now, it is Alabama, Auburn, Iowa and New Mexico,” Kouandjio told Youngblood. “I am still considering them all.”

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team has started conference play with three straight victories, the Trojans’ best start since 2000.
They will look to extend that streak tonight against No. 15 UC San Diego at San Diego’s RIMAC Arena.
Leading the way · Supporting his National Player of the Year candidacy, senior opposite Murphy Troy leads USC in kills and digs. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
On Wednesday, the Trojans (3-0, 3-0) defeated No. 7 UC Irvine for the third consecutive time, exacting revenge. Their 2009 NCAA championship loss against the Anteaters in their four-set win (25-16, 27-25, 27-29, 25-17).
Senior opposite Murphy Troy led the charge with 19 kills and 11 digs and teammate junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli followed closely with 17 kills and five blocks.
“The most important thing was that after a really emotional second and third set, we came right back out in the fourth set,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We showed a lot of mental toughness. We got back to business and exhibited a real methodical comeback.”
The Trojans showcased their depth at outside hitter starting in the second set, when sophomore outside hitter Maddison McKibbin was pulled in favor of senior outside hitter Tri Bourne.
“[McKibbin] wasn’t playing badly,” Ferguson said. “Rather, putting Bourne in was an effort to slow the match down. I had no timeouts. And he played great, so we stuck with it.”
McKibbin and his teammates have been exceptional thus far this season in terms of hitting with an efficient .401 clip, highlighted by junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick’s .778 hitting percentage Wednesday.
Also, the Trojan defense has been rabid, turning up 38 digs in Wednesday’s match, with 33 of them coming from senior setter Riley McKibbin, freshman libero Henry Cassiday and Troy.
“Henry played a [great] match for a freshman, and Riley and Murphy made two of the better defensive plays since I’ve been here,” Ferguson said. “Both of them had spectacular digs that snapped Irvine’s momentum.”
The Tritons (2-3, 1-1), led by setter Phil Bannan, entered the American Volleyball Coaches Association Top-25 poll for the first time this season last week.
“Phil Bannan is one of the best servers in the league, and also a great end blocker who’s going to be going against Ciarelli, McKibbin or Tri Bourne,” Ferguson said. “He could cause some problems for us.”
The Trojans are not panicking, but rather are focused on continuing their development in passing and converting service receives into points.
“Basically what we did in the fourth set against Irvine was side out at a really high rate and forced them into making mistakes,” Ferguson said. “It’s always going to come back to the service and pass game.”

Four days.
That’s all it took for USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill to pick up the pieces from this week’s announcement that freshman guard Bryce Jones would be transferring schools.
Friday the Trojans announced they have received a verbal commitment from Greg Allen, a shooting guard from Navarro College (Corsicana, Texas).
Allen is returning to California, where he starred at Eureka High School in Northern California from 2006-2009.
At 6-foot-3 and 175 pounds, Allen made his name as the Loggers’ point guard during his senior season.
During the 2008-2009 campaign, Allen’s scoring prowess was put on display, as he averaged 25.1 points per game and shot almost 37 percent from three-point range.
In 18 games at Navarro this year, USC’s newest acquisition averaged 11.9 points per game, 40.2 percent from behind the three-point arc and 84.8 percent from the free-throw line.
Allen, who chose USC over Boston College, provides the Trojans with not only a three-point shooter (which aside from senior guard Donte Smith are few and far between this season), but a defensive-minded player who is known for guarding the other team’s top offensive threat on the perimeter.
The addition of Allen bolsters an already impressive 2012 recruiting class for USC, which includes combo guard Larry Lewis (Arcadia High School in Phoenix) and local standout guard Katin Reinhardt (Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif.).
Allen’s return to Division-I basketball caps off a remarkable two-year journey, as he initially committed to Creighton University out of high school, but failed to even attend a semester at the Omaha, Neb.-based school.
The junior college transfer will be able to play for the Trojans in 2011 and will have two years of eligibility left.

The No. 19 women’s tennis team takes on Cal State Long Beach on Friday in its second dual meet of the season at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium.
With its recent 6-1 drubbing of Cal State Northridge on Tuesday and two tournament wins last weekend, the Women of Troy are certainly surging with confidence.
At the Freeman Memorial Women’s Tennis Championships in Las Vegas, senior Maria Sanchez won the singles competition and the doubles competition with freshman Kaitlyn Christian.
Meanwhile, at the National Collegiate Tennis Classic in La Quinta, Calif., sophomore Danielle Lao made it to the singles semifinals and two Trojan teams made it to the doubles semis.
“We certainly did okay as a team [at the NCTC],” said junior Alison Ramos. “The competition was really tough, so we didn’t post the results that we exactly wanted, but we got a few good wins under our belt and that was just really good preparation for the season.”
Even with a handful of wins, USC is not approaching its weekend slate with any signs of complacency.
“Long Beach State is always under the radar,” Ramos said. “They’ve got a lot of good foreign players. They are definitely not ranked as high as they should be, and we are definitely not expecting an easy match.”
USC coach Richard Gallien essentially reiterated Ramos’ forecast: The Women of Troy will not be underestimating the competition they face Friday.
“Long Beach State is a superior team to Northridge and we will still need to be very diligent and intense,” Gallien said.
When the team faced off against Cal State Northridge, on Tuesday, it swept the doubles and lost one singles match. Sanchez and senior Cristala Andrews, however, did not participate.
The team’s high ranking might not be enough to inspire some people to come out and watch the dual meet, but the Women of Troy’s winning ways are enough incentive for fans to watch.
After today’s dual meet against Long Beach State the team will next compete at its ITA Kickoff Weekend in Ann Arbor, Mich., a tournament where they will face host Michigan, NC State and Auburn.

The first leg of a tough Bay Area trip ended in disappointment for the USC women’s basketball team, which fell 82-71 to California.
Coming off a string of poor shooting performances, the Women of Troy (12-5, 4-2) shot 53 percent from the field but were unable to slow down the Golden Bears (11-6, 3-3).  Cal, a team not known for its outside shooting, shot better than 50 percent from the field and hit nine three-pointers.
Not enough · Despite a team-high 20 points, junior Briana Gilbreath and USC couldn’t match Cal, which collectively made eight 3-pointers. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“We just didn’t execute our scheme,” said junior guard Briana Gilbreath.  “They got outside points and inside points.  Our game plan going in was to force them to beat us from the outside but not give them open shots.”
The Women of Troy had one of their best offensive outputs of the season in the first half but found themselves trailing 44-40 at the break.  USC made seven of its first 10 field goals attempts and finished the half shooting nearly 60 percent (17 of 29).  That blistering pace was not enough to keep up with Cal, which knocked down eight three-pointers in the first half.
The Golden Bears also dominated the offensive glass in the first half, pulling down more offensive rebounds than USC grabbed defensive rebounds.  USC matched a season-low for rebounds.
“It was more of us not really crashing,” Gilbreath said. “On the defensive end they were getting a lot of second chance shots.”
Gilbreath paced USC with 13 first-half points.  Her backcourt mate, junior guard Ashley Corral, was held scoreless in the half but handed out six assists.
The Women of Troy continued their hot shooting out of the break, knocking down three of their first four attempts to grab a 57-56 lead.
After that initial burst USC’s offense stalled, registering just 24 points over the final 18 minutes of the game.
Cal, meanwhile, responded with a 12-2 run to seize a 68-59 lead.  From there, the Golden Bears held USC at bay, never letting USC get closer than seven points the rest of the way.
“[We started] settling for jump shots,” Gilbreath said. “We didn’t attack the rim, we weren’t scoring any points and they were coming down and scoring.”
Gilbreath and freshman forward Cassie Harberts paced the Women of Troy with 20 and 18 points, respectively. The 18 points marked a career-high for Harberts. Gilbreath added four steals and three blocks for USC in another strong all-around performance.
Freshman guard Len’nique Brown had one of her finest games of the season, knocking down all three of her shots and finishing with nine points.
Three players scored at least 17 points for Cal, including guard Layshia Clarendon, who finished with 17 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Center DeNesha Stallworth and guard Lindsay Sherbert added 21 and 19 points, respectively.
Despite the loss, the Women of Troy maintained their hold on third place in the conference after Arizona State lost in Pullman, Wa.
And with a road game against No. 4 Stanford looming, Gilbreath said the team can take away some positives from the Cal game.
“We did shoot the ball well tonight,” she said.  “We know we can execute some things [offensively].”
USC women took a 47-46 lead early in the second half before Cal executed an 11-2 run. The score in the story is 10 points off. (See the athletic department article related to this game.)

Tomorrow, USC suits up for its most important game of the year.
With all due respect to the men’s basketball team, this game will be played in a court 2,000 miles from the Galen Center in Indianapolis, and USC Athletic Director Pat Haden will be throwing the passes.
Bad puns aside, an impressive delegation consisting of USC’s best players in Pat Haden, Assistant Athletic Director J.K. McKay, USC President C. L. Max Nikias, among others, will sit before an NCAA appeals committee tomorrow, hoping to essentially cut in half the sanctions put on the football program last year.
But this is by no means a slam dunk (OK, I’m done).
Haden will be looking to cut the amount of football scholarships lost over the span of the next three years from 30 to 15 and reduce the bowl ban from two years to one. So, if victorious, USC will be able to play in a bowl game next year. Haden has conceded on some of the other punishments: Clearing the campus of everything related to former football player Reggie Bush, including his Heisman Trophy, and former basketball player O.J. Mayo.
Ethos, pathos and logos indicate that USC should have no trouble winning the appeal.
The university president, surly athletic director and enthusiastic football coach who presided over the program and who were deemed to have “a lack of institutional control” are gone. They are replaced by a very friendly, mild-mannered intellectual who has done nothing but cater to the NCAA’s every need. When Haden came in shortly after the sanctions were announced, he turned USC’s compliance department into a veritable Department of Homeland Security.
Any sign of misdoings, USC has reported it. It made freshman running back Dillon Baxter pay $5 to a charity for accepting a ride in a golf cart from a student who also happened to be an NFL agent. USC complied completely with the NCAA regarding Bush and hasn’t said anything to indicate bitterness or an arrogant attitude toward the almighty organization, despite the mere slap on the wrists the NCAA gave Auburn and Ohio State for violations somewhat similar to Bush’s.
But the NCAA is not an organization that relies on either emotion or logic, which is why it’s unlikely the appeal to reduce the sanctions will be granted.
Citing the precedent of the Ohio State football program being basically let off the hook, despite star quarterback Terrelle Pryor being caught in possession of a car belonging to a dealership three separate times, won’t work, even though common sense indicates otherwise.
The reason for this is a change to the NCAA bylaws in 2008. Before, an appeal could be won if it was determined that the penalty was inappropriate or excessive based on the circumstances or evidence.
Now, it can only be won if the offending institution can proclaim “the penalty is excessive such that it constitutes an abuse of discretion” by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.
This is a much harder thing to prove. In a U.S. court of law, the prosecutor needs to prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
If the U.S. trial system used the NCAA’s wording, nobody would be found guilty this side of Benedict Arnold.
But this isn’t a trial in a U.S. court, as Haden, an attorney, knows. Thus, USC needs to play by the NCAA’s rules.
“It’s not a judiciary proceeding,” Haden said. “Precedent doesn’t necessarily control the situation … At the end of the day, they don’t have to pay any attention to those. They can create new findings each time they meet.”
The NCAA is also very reluctant to prove that it displayed poor judgment and that it was at fault.
Rarely does the NCAA turn on itself and reverse its own rules. In the 11 appeals since this new standard came into effect, 10 of them have failed.
Haden knows this and is going into the proceedings with a determined but calm approach.
“I’m just realistic,” he said. “I’m just going with the odds — [about] 10 percent of appeals are successful.”
There is a better chance of only part of the sanctions being reduced rather than the whole thing.
Haden has stated multiple times he is going to make reducing the number of lost scholarships a priority because that’s ultimately what the football program needs to stay among the nation’s elite.
USC coach Lane Kiffin has backed Haden up on this approach.
Even though USC should prevail, the NCAA is not going to abort its defined culture anytime soon. Up by 25 in the fourth quarter, look for the NCAA to go for two.

As a parent of a USC athlete, I can sympathize with the football parents whose children are being punished for a past crime.  Since when in our country is that even remotely ethical or moral?  Yes, Reggie should be punished.  In addition to losing the titles, he should have been required to pay a 20x fine of the initial dollar amount involved.  And, the agent should lose his ability to deal with athletes (don’t these guys need licenses or something that can be pulled when they fail to follow the rules?).  But to punish the school and subsequent athletes doesn’t make sense.  It is virtually impossible for a coach to monitor every step an athlete makes.  They are not PI’s.  They have no access to bank accounts, car registrations, family finances . . . how can they monitor without any tools to do so except the word of an athlete?  Not only that but the NCAA doesn’t seem to follow the same rules for each school which again, is not appropriate.    In the end, the NCAA needs to develop some onerous consequences that punish the athlete, not the institution.  It’s time we make the individual fully accountable for his/her actions and not punish those not remotely involved.
And It is obvious that USC was cheating. Its not the first time USC has violated NCAA rules. They are cheaters and thats that.  Serial cheaters.
It is obvious that the NCAA abuses its power, and enters the personal ego of each investiagator in each case, easpecially USC’s. to geive such a harsh penalty to a school that actually didnt do anything wrong, as the Bush issues were with an NFL agent, and did not have anything to do with Reggies attendance at USC. It may be time for College football to abandon the NCAA, and go with some other way to enforce rules. As it stands now, no one monitors the NCAA, and it does what it wants, and never corrects itself when it is wrong. EGO. I feel it is time to dump the NCAA.
