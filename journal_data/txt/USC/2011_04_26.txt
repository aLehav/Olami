When the year began, I was warned that, despite any attempt to put a positive spin on a controversial situation, one truth would remain: The Trojans’ athletic program is fatally flawed.
People near and far continued to tell me this year would be the first of a long, dark period for USC athletics.
Nine months later, I have a resounding answer for the naysayers and Debbie Downers: You couldn’t be further from the truth.
There have been a few bumps in the road, a suspension or two and a rebuilding season here and there. Sometimes, though, the story on the surface masks the real story worth sharing.
USC’s program still faces an uphill battle in the years ahead under current Athletic Director Pat Haden. Although time will eventually wash away any sanctions, scholarship losses and postseason bans, the wounds take time to heal.
Yet from the second floor offices at Heritage Hall to the sidelines of McAlister Field to the press box at the Coliseum, instability has been replaced by potential. Irresponsibility has been replaced by flexibility and task-oriented leadership.
And through it all, the Trojan spirit has remained intact.
That might seem like a run-of-the-mill line fitting of a reflective piece, but I don’t mince words when referring to the fabric of this university’s world-class athletic tradition.
I can’t prove the strength of this so-called spirit through a long line of new national championship trophies or commemorative banners honoring Pac-10 domination in every sport, akin to men’s water polo and women’s volleyball’s notable success.
The true measure of a school’s athletic program occurs during the moments not filled with ticker-tape parades and ESPN highlight reels.
These are the moments that reveal character.
For me, these came in the places you’d least expect.
From a freshman cornerback honoring the memory of his mother to the basketball walk-on who only wanted to continue his life-long love affair with the sport to the bond between the Trojan football team and a courageous teenager fighting a disease.
These glimpses between the white lines didn’t get talked about much, though, because they lacked the quick appeal of a memorable sound bite or eye-popping image.
And sadly, it’s because of this there is a perceived stigma attached to this program. It goes beyond what happened in the past, beyond negativity spread by those who simply loathe the cardinal and gold.
But I have learned that we all have the opportunity to fight this stigma.
When you come here, you wish for BCS bowl games, Sweet 16 appearances and June baseball in Omaha, Neb.
But sometimes you have to look beyond wins and losses and instead at the rare instances that defy the perception of this school.
It doesn’t take a notepad, a recorder or a media credential to witness the hidden sports gems that lie within the walls of USC.
From the veteran volunteers at Heritage’s information desk to the two-star athlete trying to make a name for himself on the football field and on the track to the tennis player who spent his summer working on Capitol Hill, every nook and cranny has a tale worth telling.
In a result-driven world of sports this sometimes tedious task might not sound appealing or worth the effort. And honestly, odds are your findings won’t amount to more on-field success or gain you any individual publicity.
But as I found out along my journalistic path of image restoration this year, sometimes you can be rewarded with a little clarity at the end if you find the right angle.
For me, it was realizing there is no better time to be a USC Trojan than right now.

Within five minutes of the final out of Long Beach State’s 7-1 victory over USC on Tuesday, all 35 players were gone from the field, clubhouse and stadium as a whole.
No support · Junior pitcher Brandon Garcia gave up four runs, but was hurt by two errors that led to two unearned Long Beach State runs. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“I kicked them out,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “They didn’t wanna be here the whole game, why should they wanna be here now.”
The first-year coach was understandably unhappy after his team seemed to disappear on him.
The Trojans (18-22) recorded just five hits and a lone first-inning run against the Dirtbags (20-18). What drew the ire of the coach even more were the Trojans’ three errors, which led to four unearned runs.
“We were not prepared to play,” Cruz said. “That’s all there is to it.”
The fifth inning was particularly poor to USC, as the Dirtbags plated four runners to break a 1-1 tie.
The decisive inning started with a pair of back-to-back singles off USC junior pitcher Brandon Garcia. A sacrifice-fly brought the first run in, and then things really started to fall apart. USC allowed a steal off second on a botched pitchout.
Then with runners at the corners and one out, Dirtbag first baseman Ino Patron slapped a grounder to USC junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa. Instead of getting the sure out at home, Oropesa tried to spin and turn a spectacular double play, but instead threw the ball into left field.
After getting an out at home on a fielder’s choice by Dirtbag catcher Mike Marjama, USC looked like it might get out of the jam with just two runs on the board. But Garcia threw away an attempted pickoff attempt, allowing Patron to score from third.
The Dirtbags tacked on their fourth and final run of the inning on an infield single.
USC actually struck first against the Dirtbags (20-18) in the bottom of the first. Junior catcher Kevin Roundtree walked and stole second. Senior second baseman Joe De Pinto followed with an RBI double to right, and then the Trojan bats fell silent.
USC recorded just four more hits in the entire game off six different Dirtbag pitchers, striking out six times.
Freshman pitcher Kyle Richter made his third-career start and delivered three strong innings. The young lefty scattered three hits over the three frames before being removed in favor of Garcia following a leadoff walk and single in the fourth.
Garcia allowed one of Richter’s baserunners to score, but got out of the fourth relatively unscathed. The fifth, however, was not so kind to him.
Following the disaster of an inning, the Trojans made wholesale changes in the sixth, but to minimal avail.
Senior second baseman and captain Joe De Pinto dropped a routine fly ball that led to a run to make it 6-1.
The Dirtbags tacked on their final run in the seventh without a hit, courtesy of a walk, balk, sacrifice and wild pitch.
It’s USC’s first midweek loss in four weeks, and their first multiple-game losing streak since early April at No. 13 California.
“We just need to bury the shovel,” Cruz said. “Me yelling at them was gonna do no good. We all just need to forget about it and move on.”
It won’t be easy for the Trojans to rebound. They face perennial powerhouse Arizona for a three-game set this weekend in Tuscon, Ariz.

The USC men’s and women’s tennis teams have found similar success over the last few years — success due in large part to two players.
Captains of their respective squads, junior Steve Johnson and senior Maria Sanchez have quietly risen to the top.
Top-notch talent · Junior Steve Johnson has helped lead the Trojans to a Pac-10 championship and a 21-2 mark during the regular season. Now, he is looking to lead USC to its third-consecutive NCAA title. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Between March 14 and April 11, both were atop the collegiate tennis hierarchy, making NCAA history as the first male and female ranked No. 1 from the same school.
“I feel really fortunate and honored to be a part of this,” Sanchez said. “I know Steve’s a great player and works really hard too, so it’s great that we can both be number one together.”
Sanchez is now ranked No. 2, while Johnson has stayed at the No. 1 spot.
Individually, they are two of the most accomplished athletes at USC.
In his freshman and sophomore seasons, Johnson and the team won back-to-back national championships, bringing the crown home to the Trojans for the first time since 2002. This year, with a 21-2 overall record and Pac-10 championship, the team is poised for a three-peat.
Johnson, who co-captains the Trojans with senior Jaak Poldma, is undefeated this season. The journey to the top has been tough, but Johnson has proved time and again he is up to the challenge.
“Coming into college was a big wake up call,” Johnson said. “I realized that talent and what you did in the past doesn’t mean much. I learned to have a work ethic.”
And he learned quickly. USC men’s coach Peter Smith praised Johnson’s dedication and determination, and said he is always eager to improve his game.
“You don’t win national championships without special people, and he’s as special as they come,” Smith said.
Sanchez, in her final season with the Women of Troy, captains her team. She, too, has worked hard to get to the top. Sanchez played at No. 5 her freshman season and would work her way up the ladder to finally land the No. 1 spot her junior season.
“When I first found out I was No. 1, it was definitely a relief,” Sanchez said. “This is where I feel like I should be right now. But it’s really just a ranking. I’m trying to focus on the process and getting better.”
USC women’s coach Richard Gallien was quick to emphasize Sanchez’ progress, crediting her passion as what separates her from the rest.
“She has a ferocious desire,” Gallien said. “Not everyone has got the courage to put themselves on the line every day.”
Aside from their many accomplishments, what is perhaps most impressive about Johnson’s and Sanchez’s respective games is their humility. Their modesty, leadership and undeniable skill, has earned them both an unquestionable respect among teammates.
“When we were playing well together, I felt that we were unstoppable,” said freshman Ray Sarmiento, who started the season playing at No. 1 doubles with Johnson. “He is kind of a mentor to me and I’m learning from him.”
Junior Alison Ramos, who has played alongside Sanchez for nearly three seasons, was just as impressed.
“There’s passion when she plays,” Ramos said. “She is a fighter. She really pushes the importance of family and team, and she really wants us to come together.”
Through it all, Sanchez and Johnson have stayed grounded, competing with a love for the game and remembering the sport relies just as much on teamwork.
“Individual success is not much unless you have a group of people to share it with,” Johnson said. “Two of the greatest moments of my life were winning the national titles and being able to just go hug a bunch of my friends.”
Johnson and Sanchez have accomplished much while donning the cardinal and gold, both individually and with their teammates, but there’s still more they’d like to do.
“I’m hoping to get a couple more national titles,” Johnson said. “That’s been the goal from day one.”
Sanchez expressed similar sentiments.
“To win a team national championship, that’d be most important to me,” Sanchez said.

USC’s administration is attempting to keep up with the student demand for sustainable food.
Administrators intend to implement programs to reduce USC’s dependence on long-distance food suppliers and improve the university’s green food practices, such as committing to buying local California dairy and produce.
Nom nom · Students at USC’s dining halls have not used trays since the fall of 2008, as part of USC’s attempt to decrease food and water waste. - Daily Trojan file photo 
“A lot of students are focused on the issue of sustainability. The big thing right now is creating awareness and then creating a process to follow up on this enthusiasm,” said Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality.
USC Hospitality, which is in charge of purchasing and managing the food at the different eateries on the university’s campuses, has adopted a number of new programs in recent years to keep the university moving toward a greener future and to address the growing concern of students.
“I don’t feel like food is extremely fresh on campus, especially at the dining halls,” said Sarah Sensenbach, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “They could improve food options even at the Campus Center to make them more healthy and greener.”
The trayless dining initiative, started in the fall of 2008, has been one of the more successful sustainability programs. According to Klinger, the program has already reduced food waste 20 to 30 percent. By going trayless, USC has also cut down the number of dishes and trays that need to be washed.
Additionally, since 2009, there has been a large movement at USC to donate foods like produce and other perishable items to the Los Angeles Mission, while non-perishables are kept refrigerated or frozen. Both of the main residential dining kitchens — Parkside and EVK — have also had their own food pulpers for the last five or so years. Having a pulper means 100 percent of post-consumer waste at both of these locations is mulched and used for fertilizer or other organic products.
Yet one of the biggest concerns for students isn’t where the food is going, but where the food is coming from.
“USC is not doing a good job about being sustainable,” said Melanie Mathis, a junior majoring in political science. “They do not really consider where food comes from, whether produce is organic or not or how animals are being treated for the meat we eat.”
Though some students might feel USC does not consider where or how its food is produced, USC is, in fact, rather conscious of where its food comes from.
“When it’s brought to our attention that animals have been treated inhumanely, we will do something, like with our Seafood Watch and cage-free eggs programs. However, this issue hasn’t elevated to the top of our list,” Klinger said.
USC receives approximately 6 percent of its food and beverages from local producers, according to Klinger. It uses the same couple of dozen vendors on a daily basis.
To keep up with growing demand for local and organic food, USC is now committed to using dairy produced only in California, serving cage-free eggs and supporting as much local seafood and produce as possible.
“We are creating a purchasing platform to make sure we maintain sustainable seafood, cage-free eggs and California dairy. This has been our focus for the past couple of years, and last year especially,” Klinger said.
Although it might be more expensive to switch to local producers and greener methods of food production and consumption, USC is trying to offset this increasing price tag by implementing new programs — such as trayless dining — that reduce other costs.
Because USC has to feed an entire community and there are many changes to consider, becoming a greener campus will not occur overnight.
“[Being sustainable] is a process. It will evolve over time,” Klinger said.
This article reads like it was written by USC administrators. 6% of food grown locally is very little. especially when you consider that Cal and Puget Sound have dining halls that serve NOTHING BUT ORGANIC FOOD while Stanford gets half of its produce locally. More strides need to be taken
Where’s the true “green” option on campus… I can’t find any good/ true vegan option on campus… Most of the hospitality guys don’t even know that vegan doesn’t consist of cheese… Also in RTH, they prepare the so-called vege sandwich on the same cutting boards, on which they prepare non-veg sandwich… I ended up canceling the order as the board was filled with animal remains, they don’t even clean it… Well, why does USC not care much for its vegan/ vegetarian community?????
“The trayless dining initiative, started in the fall of 2008, has been one of the more successful sustainability programs.”
Oh really. Ask any worker in the cafeterias and they will tell you all the clean up from broken glasses and dropped plates is not worth the hassle.

Student loan debt surpassed credit card debt for the first time last year, according to a report by Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org and Fastweb.com, websites that help students find ways to pay for college.
Kantrowitz compiled the overall estimate of current student federal and private loan debt, which is likely to top $1 trillion this year as students continue to borrow more money for their education.
The current credit card debt is $826.5 billion, while the student loan debt is $830 billion, according to the report.
USC ranks seventh in the nation for average student debt, with the average graduate having to repay a debt of $36,787, according to a CNBC study released earlier this year. Nationally, last year’s graduates owe an average of $24,000 in student loans.
Michael Kim, chief marketing officer for the USC Credit Union, used to run the student loan program at USC Credit Union and said it is encouraging that student loan debt has eclipsed credit card debt.
“The fact that credit card debt is falling behind student loan debt is definitely a good sign that students are realizing the dangers involved in getting bogged down in credit card debt,” Kim said. “Especially while in school, it’s important that students manage their spending habits and do not rely upon credit cards to make purchases they can’t afford.”
Many economists view student debt as a valuable investment. Kim encourages students to note that debt, whether good or bad, is still debt, and needs to be repaid.
“The bottom line is that all debt must be repaid,” Kim said. “Students have to realize that these are obligations that must be repaid and the consequences for defaulting on your loans or credit cards are severe.”
Students often make it a priority to pay off credit card debt, rather than loan debt. Kim said this is because student loan debt is easily forgotten while students are still in school, since repayment doesn’t begin until after they graduate. Credit card debt, however, is more immediate and requires monthly payments.
“While students are in college, student loans get pushed to the back. They are easier to forget because we don’t start paying them off until after graduation and they don’t accrue interest until then,” said Blake Phillips, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science.
Kim said students need to be aware of both their credit card and student loan debt.
“Defaulting or not paying back any of your loans or credit cards will immediately impact your credit score,” Kim said. “Bad credit can impact your ability to secure a job with more and more companies pulling a job applicant’s credit score.”
To balance credit card debt and student loan debt, Kim recommends students try to minimize loans as much as possible.
Credit card debt should be avoided at all costs, according to Kim, and the total balance should be paid off each month to avoid accruing interest and to build a positive credit history.
Would you mind making the distinction between average undergraduate debt and graduate debt. If I am not mistaken, I believe that $37k figure is the average of both. I think it could be somewhat misleading to perspective and current students if this distinction is not made.

Professor William W. Holder has been named the new dean of the USC Leventhal School of Accounting.
Holder, who currently holds the Ernst and Young Professorship in Accounting, will succeed Dean Randolph Beatty on July 1. Beatty has been the dean of Leventhal since August 2001.
“I view this position as one that involves being a steward of a great school. My job is to preserve and to protect and to advance,” Holder said in a press release.
In a press statement, James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business, praised Holder’s academic accomplishments and commitment to his students.
“Bill Holder exemplifies the traits of an ideal USC dean,” Ellis said. “He has attained the highest levels of distinction in teaching, in research, in leadership within his academic discipline and his university and in service to his community.”
Upon assuming his role as dean, Holder intends to revamp the school’s curriculum to more accurately reflect the evolving world of accounting.
Holder also plans to focus on faculty recruitment, while still teaching and remaining accessible to students, according to the statement.
“I love teaching,” Holder said. “It’s filled with tremendous rewards.”
Holder received both a doctorate in business administration and his master’s of accountancy from the University of Oklahoma and is a certified public accountant in both Oklahoma and California.
In 2001 and 2002 Holder was recognized by Accounting Today as one of the 100 most influential people in accounting.
He was also appointed to the Accounting Circle Professorship in Accounting in 1988 and has served as the director of the USC SEC and Financial Reporting Institute since 1994.
Ellis also acknowledged Beatty’s valuable services to the school.
“During Dean Beatty’s 10 years of leadership, the Leventhal School has continued its ascent to become a top-ranked, elite school of accounting,” Ellis said.
Leventhal’s undergraduate program is ranked No. 6 by US News & World Report and its master of business taxation degree is ranked No. 4 in the nation by Public Accounting Report.

Lil’ B is gay. We’ve known this for more than a week now, since the rapper announced the title of his upcoming album, I’m Gay, onstage at Coachella.
Does this mean the world has finally found the first gay rapper?
In the common sense of the word, no.
But Lil’ B interprets the word “gay” in the old fashioned manner, using its traditional meaning of “happy.”
Judging by the chuckles that open numerous Lil’ Wayne and Wiz Khalifa songs, lots of other rappers are gay, too.
Like those rappers, Lil’ B asserts his heterosexuality far too often during many songs in his catalogue, such as the bluntly titled “Suck My Dick Ho.”
Still, the rapper felt the need to defend himself in an interview with MTV, in which he made the humorous statement, “I’m a gay, heterosexual male.”
Because of Lil’ B’s heterosexuality, many speculate the rapper’s choice of album title is simply a publicity stunt.
The rapper even hinted at this himself when he announced to the audience his latest album title would be “the most controversial thing in hip hop.”
If controversy and publicity were his aim, the rapper has already succeeded.
The story has been featured in most of the prominent music publications, and many more likely know about the MC because of it.
The announcement has also caused a negative backlash, as many of Lil’ B’s fans have abandoned him. He’s even received death threats.
But though the album title could just be a gimmick, it’s more likely a continuation of the rapper’s largely nonsensical lyrical content.
In the song “I’m Miley Cyrus,” for instance, Lil’ B brags, I look like Paris Hilton.
He has also claimed to be Barbara Walters, Martha Stewart, Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. Despite his dark skin, he even raps, I’m white like Asher Roth in one song.
Until the announcement of I’m Gay, these lyrics always seemed funny, but otherwise dumb and pointless. It took the recent controversy to make people realize lyrical pointlessness could, in a way, be exactly Lil’ B’s point.
“So many people be worried about what people mean with definitions and words and s***” Lil’ B said onstage at Coachella.
He might not have phrased that sentence in the most grammatically correct way, but that only emphasizes the message.
Words are just words, until humans give them negative connotations.
If anything, Lil’ B’s decision is admirable in that it exposes the ridiculously negative connotations surrounding words such as “gay.”
At their core, they’re just words, and the joke is on those who have sent the rapper death threats for using one in his album title.
Even if Lil’ B’s nonsensical ramblings will never truly convince the public that words are, ultimately, meaningless, hopefully he’ll at least be able to convince people to start using these now-negative words in a more positive manner.
He’s valiant for using “gay” in a different, more progressive way. But it’s just a start.

Graffiti scrawled on overpasses, in alleys and on the fronts of apartment buildings can be seen as a nuisance that promotes gang activity and lowers property value.
Photos by Rachel Vegas | Daily Trojan
But the Art in the Streets exhibit at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art presents graffiti in a different light through commissioned and voluntary works.
Art in the Streets is the first major exhibition of graffiti to be organized by an American museum.
The exhibit at MOCA has garnered both harsh criticism for glorifying this illegal act and praise for its acknowledgement of graffiti as a form of self-expression.
The elaborately tagged school bus in front of the entrance of the exhibit is just a small taste of what the show has to offer.
Upon entering the exhibit, the first pieces serve as an overview of notable graffiti styles that developed throughout the years in different parts of the world, starting in the early 1970s.
The exhibit puts emphasizes  techniques that originated in Los Angeles and New York City, highlighting their contrasting styles. The colorful “wild style” of the East Coast is complemented with tags from hip-hop culture, while gritty “cholo” graffiti exists alongside the Southern California punk and skate scene graffiti.
After this introduction to the graffiti art world, the rest of the exhibit is a massive network of elaborate backdrops that takes hours to fully experience.
Banksy, one of the most recognizable names in the graffiti world, has his own tribute section that is significantly larger than most of the other exhibit sections. A striking mural of a young man kneeling to pray under massive, tagged archways catches the eye immediately.
There are plenty of other Banksy works, featuring mostly dark shades with minimal splashes of bright colors, that show off his trademark style.
The most compelling section of Art in the Streets puts visitors right in the middle of the action, as they walk through a display set up to feel like an actual city street while seeing works by artists such as Todd James, Dan Murphy and Alexis Rose.
The details in the dark and dirty alley are phenomenal, from tagged payphones to vibrant block-letter advertisements and marked-up liquor store windows.
A look into several bedrooms, most of them small and made up of three walls,  on this faux city street gives insight into what the private life of a graffiti artist is like, with rough sketches scattered on a desk and spray cans hidden under a bed.
After maneuvering through the buzzing “street,” there are dozens of smaller rooms to look through that are dedicated to individual street artists.
Standout displays include work from Retna, an Angeleno whose bright blue symbols cover the walls, making his display dynamic and distinctive. Next door, you can view professional skateboarder Mark Gonzales’ take on street art characterized by long, distorted mirrors covered with engaging phrases in simple black lettering.
The display by Neckface is also remarkable, setting up a strikingly realistic New York subway atmosphere in which there is trash on the floor, scribblings on the cold walls and a mannequin of a hobo sleeping in a dark corner.
One argument in defense of graffiti art is its ability to present critical political and social commentary not found in other art forms. At Art in the Streets, however, there are very few examples of this politically charged variety on display.
Any message that seemed too loaded, including renowned Italian street artist Blu’s piece featuring dollar bills on top of caskets, was removed before the exhibit’s opening by head curator Jeffrey Deitch, according to The Huffington Post.
Thankfully, there is so much to see that the lack of controversial statements doesn’t take much impact away from of Art in the Streets.
Short films and documentaries are played in theater rooms and projected on walls throughout the museum.
There is also a cozy reading room toward the end of the exhibit and a small skate ramp serving as a reminder that graffiti can go hand-in-hand with other trends and lifestyles.
The bathrooms, too, are exhibits of their own, with bold bubbled letters covering each stall door.
At times overwhelming in its scope of displays, Art in the Streets is a unique showcase likely to attract the youth of the Los Angeles area.
MOCA is taking a bold leap by treating graffiti as a legitimate art form. But no matter your opinion on it, it’s hard to deny this exhibits entertainment value and mass appeal.
 
Art in the Streets runs until Aug. 8 at the Geffen Contemporary of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The museum is located at 152 North Central Ave. in Los Angeles

Frank McCourt is in the poor house, and Major League Baseball recently took steps to ensure his financial problems no longer affect the Los Angeles Dodgers’ day-to-day operations.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
McCourt, who is in the middle of a lengthy and heavily publicized divorce trial with ex-wife Jamie McCourt, had spent so much money on his lavish lifestyle and legal fees he didn’t have any left for the team.
It shouldn’t surprise anyone that McCourt ran the Dodgers into a ditch, with no feasible way of getting out of it. And it certainly shouldn’t surprise the owners, who should have sensed impending disaster in selling ownership to McCourt in the first place. They should have done everything they could to keep him out of the driver’s seat. Too little too late.
Last week, MLB commissioner Bud Selig made the decision to appoint former Texas Rangers President J. Thomas Schieffer to oversee the Dodgers’ financial operations, effectively pushing McCourt out of the picture in a move designed to make him sell a team he should have never been able to own in the first place.
The owners made a mistake allowing him to join their club in 2005 for the price of $430 million, because it was painfully obvious McCourt didn’t have any money to begin with. McCourt originally bought the Dodgers in a heavily leveraged deal, taking out loans and even putting up his Boston parking lots as collateral.
Their decision to ignore all signs of McCourt’s financial issues — among them, having no liquid capital to fund the franchise — has now led to a conflict of interest for MLB: Does it take the steps to improve the Dodgers by pouring money into the squad?
MLB might want to think twice before adding payroll to the Dodgers, because once it does show a vested interest in improving the team through financial assistance, who is to say other teams won’t ask for the same?
The details would confuse anyone who’s not a finance major. But any knowledgeable fan knows McCourt financed the franchise through nothing but personal debt.
McCourt never had the money to purchase the team, let alone operate it and make it a true contender.
NewsCorp, the media conglomerate headed by Rupert Murdoch that owns FOX and the Wall Street Journal, sold the Dodgers to the McCourts. FOX controls Saturday and Sunday programming for baseball, and naturally Selig and the owners want to appease Murdoch.  These details indicate the owners share just as much blame as McCourt for the mess the Dodgers are in today, both financially and on the field.
Miraculously, the Dodgers found a way to make back-to-back National League Championship Series appearances, losing to the Phillies both times. During this run, however, payroll was slashed while ticket and concession prices were raised to cover costs. Naturally, these financial problems snowballed.
Just last week, McCourt took out a $30 million loan to meet the Dodgers’ payroll obligations. By the time the divorce trial came around in 2009, McCourt had earned himself a new, and accurate, nickname: McBankrupt.
The negligence of the owners while vetting McCourt as an owner has set the Dodgers back, disgracing one of the league’s premier clubs while shedding light on the shady way that he became the owner in the first place.
Now, the lack of foresight has created a precarious situation for Selig. If he chooses to pour league money into the Dodgers, it displays favoritism. He is giving them a competitive advantage they would not previously have if McCourt had been the director of financial operations. But if he doesn’t give the Dodgers the financial flexibility of other teams, they’re going to remain mediocre at best.
If MLB can collaborate with potential outside investors, the once proud Dodgers could be out of this mess within a few years, but the damage has been done. Somehow, it wasn’t all McCourt’s fault.

Not mentioned is one most important piece of this financial Dodger mess; the absolute need for a new stadium.  Dodger Stadium is the 3rd oldest Ball Park in America (Man, it’s still got open trouphs for urinals) which sits atop 2 earthquake faults, Elysian Park and Puente Hills.  Both run closest to the surface at Dodger Stadium and Bunker Hill.
Think twice about having an upper deck at Dodger Stadium flatten you and yours like a pancake.
The much needed seismic retrofit project for Dodger Stadium was halted.  It doesn’t matter.
Dodger Stadium is a death trap.  I’m not going back to Dodger Stadium.  EOS
Misleading headline
And yes, although its not entirely his fault, McCourt is largely to blame…..
While it may be true that Major League Baseball blew it when they accepted McCourt as owner of the Dodgers, it was also imperative they(MLB) step inn and correct(remedy) this mistake immediately before it got any worse!! I think its obvious by now & quite apparent that McCourt never should have been allowed to purchase the Dodgers but now that the mistake was already commited what would you have done?! Allow McCourt to take more Dodger $$ from FOX then pay off his ex-wife and get himself(& the team) in more DEBT??!! It would have been catastrophic for the team and also for MLB to allow one of its flagship franchises to go belly up!

Unless you’ve been living under a rock the last four years, you’ve heard of the iPhone. You know it does crazy things.
You can be on the phone with a friend while browsing the Yelp application for a restaurant nearby, and then the app can give you directions to that restaurant. Once you’re there, you can check in on FourSquare using your iPhone, so your location is published on Facebook and all your friends can see where you’re spending your Saturday night.
Some of the iPhone’s most popular and useful functions depend on access to the user’s current location. But lately, there has been a lot of criticism about iPhones’ and iPads’ ability to track and record data on users’ locations.
Although it isn’t right that Apple can collect information about its users without their consent, it is not as harmful as it’s being made out to be.
The controversy began last week, when data scientists found iPhones and iPads have an unencrypted file that contains a detailed history of your locations from the last 10 months.
So whenever you’re lost and you use the maps feature to find your current location, the information is recorded and sent to Apple. This file is permanent. Anyone with physical access to your iPhone or iPad can obtain this information.
The iPhone tracking has been characterized as an unwelcome invasion of privacy and an alarming security breach.
Overnight, Apple became the Big Brother of the information era, secretly collecting information about its users and hoarding it for unknown purposes.
But in many ways, the iPhone and many other forms of technology, such as Facebook or even online shopping, have already reshaped our concept of privacy. What used to be strictly private now consistently overlaps with the realm of public information.
iPhone or iPad users were tacit participants in the evolution of the notion of privacy. Virtually every aspect of our lives is shared online through our Apple devices.
Though the information Apple has been collecting might put you at risk if someone hacks or steals your phone, for the most part, people have already been sharing their location and other information willingly using their favorite apps.
And according to Apple, the information is helping users by generating a more comprehensive location database that will improve their location services.
As a newcomer to Los Angeles, I fully depend on the GPS-based apps to get directions, find restaurants and familiarize myself with the city. I don’t mind that they’re tracking where I go, especially if it leads to providing quicker and better location-related features.
The security risks and controversial privacy concerns surrounding this issue are valid. It’s important to care about protection of privacy rights. But there’s no reason to freak out.
Why not be aware of the potential (but not yet real) problems and look at the iPhone’s tracking ability as something we can use to improve our own lives?

A $110 million donation for scholarships will be annonced Wednesday. The donation was made by John Mork, chief executive of Energy Corp. of America and alumn of USC, and his wife Julie Mork, who runs the firm’s charitable foundation. Both are Trustees of the University.
The donation is supposed to cover tuition and some expenses for about 100 undergraduates, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“Public and private education has gotten more expensive over time. I think this will allow the very best kids to get a degree at USC, whether they can afford it or not,” Mork said.

In the two years since USC took over control of the USC University Hospital and the USC Norris Cancer Hospital, both have seen drastic growth and increased recognition, largely because of both centers’ improved reputation within the medical field.
USC purchased both hospitals from Tenet Healthcare Corp. for $275 million in a deal closed March 31, 2009. This acquisition allowed faculty physicians at USC to care for private patients at both hospitals, giving physicians greater control over the direction of clinical and research programs focusing on a wide array of diseases and health issues.
“We wanted to build a stronger health sciences campus and create a better environment for medical research and teaching,” said Mitchell Creem, CEO of USC Hospitals.
By purchasing these two hospitals, Creem said USC took steps toward a long-term goal of creating a more robust academic medical center at the university.
President C. L. Max Nikias, who at the time of the purchase was the executive vice president and provost at USC, played a major role in the acquisition of the hospitals, and the development of USC’s Health Sciences enterprise is one of Nikias’ goals as president.
Creem praised President Nikias’ involvement in obtaining the hospitals for the university.
“He understood early that in order to have a great medical school, we needed a great medical center as well,” Creem said. “He had a vision that biotechnology research would be a leading force in the 21st century, and he wanted to position USC to be at the forefront of that.”
The hospitals have already been successful in allowing USC to build and implement strong clinical programs, especially in areas such as transplant surgery, cardiovascular surgery, urology and the neurosciences.
“The transplant surgery program has really flourished since we’ve acquired the hospitals,” Creem said. “Our cancer programs have also grown significantly, and we have been able to recruit new doctors for it. All of these clinical programs have been providing additional financial support for the hospitals, and have also improved our national reputation from a marketing and outreach perspective.”
The success of these programs has played a critical role in recruiting more students to the Keck School of Medicine and more experienced and world-renowned doctors to the two hospitals.
“Excellent patient care enhances the reputation of the medical school,” Creem said. “As this gets recognized nationally, we are able to keep attracting higher-quality physicians. This then allows us to get more research funding, which will raise our reputation again, and so on. This creates a really positive cycle by having a great academic medical center in the first place.”
In addition, the hospitals began participating in a distinctive program last December called Project Transformation, which aims to increase communication and cooperation between the five providers of medical care at USC: the county hospital, Tenet Corporation, the USC University Hospital, the USC Norris Cancer Hospital and private practices.
David Logan, a faculty member at the Marshall School of Business and an expert in leadership, negotiations, and corporate strategy who works with Project Transformation, said the program is unique in identifying different unproductive patterns of behavior people have and then finding ways to have the group commit to removing them completely.
“Its impact is going to be very dramatic, and is going to affect every aspect of the hospitals,” Logan said. “It’s going to improve hospitals as a place to work, improve relationships between different groups, and make it more fun to go to work. The quality of work will go up, the medical outcomes will improve, as will the medical decisions and revenue. It’s one of those situations where everybody wins.”
Project Transformation takes place every month for four days, and 60 hospital
employees, nurses, physicians and faculty members learn various strategies on how to build better working relationships with one another and create new possibilities in the realm of health care.
“Our ability to succeed is only limited by our ability to work together effectively,” Creem said. “Project Transformation provides us with a renewed sense of commitment to a new purpose, which is exactly why we wanted to acquire these hospitals in the first place.”
Programs like Project Transformation are just one part of how the university’s purchase of the USC University Hospital and the USC Norris Cancer Hospital has improved the medical communities on campus.
“This acquisition leads to opportunities to create a new and improved USC academic medical center,” Creem said. “We’re trying to create a new brand of medicine.”

USC’s Keck School of Medicine isn’t scared by the fierce competition for federal research grants.
In 2010, Keck experienced a dramatic jump in funding — more than $33 million — from the National Institutes of Health, which allowed for the average research funding per faculty to jump by more than $20,000, from $121,000 per faculty member to $144,000. This also improved Keck’s ranking in US News & World Report’s list of best medical schools from No. 39 to No. 34.

Elizabeth Fini, vice dean for research at Keck, said research is now a top priority for the school, in part thanks to the efforts of Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito, Provost Elizabeth Garrett and President C. L. Max Nikias.
“Keck School faculty members are experiencing new success in competition for large team grants,” Fini said. “Recent aggressive recruitment of star research leaders is part of the reason for this change to a ‘themes, teams and centers’
approach.”
Part of Keck’s success can be attributed to its participation in the competition for NIH grants as part of the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act, also known as the federal economic stimulus. According to Fini, the Recovery Act has a much more rapid time line for grant submission — normally the process can take up to three years — which is why Keck saw such a drastic increase in rankings and federal funding in just one year.
In the short term, Keck’s jump will allow the school to invest in its infrastructure.
“The result will be a brand new animal care and use facility in the magnificent Broad [California Institute for Regenerative Medicine] Center, scheduled to open in the fall,” Fini said. “It is expected that such leveraging will enable us to sustain a steady level of growth in the long term, with an accompanying climb in the rankings.”
Many of the programs at Keck pulling in a significant portion of  funding are ones that could make the greatest impact on human health, according to Fini. Research programs in cancer, emerging and global pathogens, and global health have been among some of the most successful at earning funding in recent years.
The USC Institute for Global Health, which aims to provide world health leaders with the information necessary to deal with global disability and disease, is among the programs that have experienced substantial growth lately.
Ivette Flores Guintu, program manager for the Institute, said research being done there is extremely relevant to the USC community.
“Being in L.A., we deal with a global population every single day,” Guintu said. “We have a really important role to play as globalization becomes a more prevalent focus in everything we do.”
Guintu said the Institute recently began developing an online video game intended to raise awareness of the importance of alliances among non-governmental organizations, the community and the government to improve global nutrition.
“The game will hopefully develop into something broader and on a bigger scale for social impact and change,” Guintu said.
Fini said Puliafito has made translational research, or research designed to shorten the time it takes for a lab discovery to be applied to a patient an extremely high priority.
“We are seeing more basic researchers doing applied studies, as well as more clinician-scientists and clinician-researchers as well,” she said.
Fini explained this relationship can be extended when the Keck School clinical faculty members see patients who are in USC Hospitals and then bring their research findings to their patients.
“We are all a team with a common goal to improve health,” she said.

Writing a research paper need not involve labor-intensive and time-consuming readings of texts.
Tara McPherson | Daily Trojan file photo
Instead, imagine videos, images, colors, graphs and speech lighting up each page. Words might be non-linear and color-coded, linking to relevant information and visuals. And perhaps, it might even pique enough curiosity in the reader to start a discussion.
That’s the kind of multi-level collaboration Tara McPherson, an associate professor at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, has built through her research on the impact of digital media in culture and society.
“It’s not just because it’s glitzy and because Apple does it,” McPherson said. “I think already we are seeing changes in textbook publishing to include data sets, videos or images.”
The digital age mandates writing take on digital forms, McPherson said, and she believes such multimedia writing will open up exciting possibilities for scholarly work in all fields, especially the humanities.
“A lot of people question what happens in research at the universities and the validity of such research, particularly the humanities,” McPherson said. “By disseminating our work to a wider audience, we can make a stronger case for the importance and relevance of humanities today.”
Some of her research on the potential impact of digital media actually takes place in her Culture, Technology and Communications class. The students, mostly undergraduates, collaborate with elementary school teachers at Los Feliz Charter School to find innovative ways to bring digital tools like flip cams and mobile phones into the coursework.
McPherson also helps scholars submit and publish experimental projects showcasing the technological possibilities for future humanities research in her electronic journal, Vectors.
These experimental projects  helped produce a user-friendly version of the multimedia platform called Scalar, which gives users an easy template to turn their long-form scholarship into a digital “scrapbook.”
With Scalar, scholarly articles can include easy navigation tools and related video and audio clips, in addition, of course, to text.
Users have the option to change the layouts of each “page” according to what works best for them. For example, a person who learns better visually might want a media-centered layout, while a person looking for a more comprehensive view can choose a graphical layout that shows how certain “pages” overlap and intersect.
Scalar doesn’t aim to replace books, McPherson said. It just offers more options for scholars whose work deals with visual and digital material.
For example, McPherson works with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute, which provides an extensive archive of video interviews with survivors from the Holocaust. With Scalar, scholars from the Shoah Institute can publish their articles next to videos from the archives, where seeing the human faces can add an emotional weight compared to plain reading, McPherson said.
“In a world fraught by genocides and riots, I think it’s very important to understand the history of such movements,” McPherson said. “Contributing to preserve such history is an ethical thing for scholars to do.”
But McPherson adds that she hasn’t gone 100 percent digital yet.
“Learning to have the time to be quiet and thoughtful is also very important,” McPherson said.
To take a break from the technology world, McPherson said she and her nine-year-old son love to sit side-by-side reading “good old-fashioned books” — though hers, naturally, are on a Kindle.

Ron Astor works to make schools safer.
Astor, who holds joint appointments in the USC School of Social Work and the USC Rossier School of Education, has spent nine years at USC researching violence in schools around the world.

Earlier this year, the Society for Social Work and Research gave Astor the 2011 Excellence in Research Award for his study on violence in Israeli schools.
Astor has also developed a widely used school mapping and local monitoring procedure that targets settings and places, rather than individuals, in solving safety issues in schools.
The Daily Trojan sat down with Astor to discuss his recent research and how he’s working to reduce violence in schools worldwide.
 
Daily Trojan: What is the focus of your research?
Ron Astor: Currently, I’m working with military-connected schools. These are schools that serve kids that come from families that are currently serving in the military. We’re working with the principals and teachers in schools to make those environments welcoming because kids go through a lot of stress from their parents’ deployments and with the multiple transitions from school to school in locations all around the world. The second area of research I’ve been doing for a long time is around issues of school safety and how different countries and cultures deal with issues of school safety.
 
DT: Does your research focus on schools in a certain area?
Astor: Regionally, a lot of my work has been done in the Middle East.  Many of our interventions and research ideas are in all 3,000 schools in Israel, and France is looking at using them right now. And now California is looking at some of them. We look at all forms of school violence and school safety and different ways of approaching it, ranging from name-calling to shootings and everything in between.
 
 
DT: What was your initial motivation or interest in doing research about school violence?
Astor: I’ve been doing it since I got my masters degree at USC back between 1983 and ’85. I graduated in ’85.  The more I looked into it, I realized there wasn’t a lot of stuff done just about schools and what schools could do — in the old days it was more about families and what was wrong with the kids. That’s what has made our research so interesting to people. We’re not focusing on individuals per se, but we’re really focused on settings, the places. What are the social spaces that make people get along and feel safe and actually promote peace and togetherness? When you ask the question that way it becomes much more interesting, especially when you’re looking at school violence.
 
DT: Can you tell me a little bit about the mapping and local monitoring procedure that you developed and how it can be used to find solutions to school safety problems?
Astor: It’s identifying locations and times that are not owned by anyone. Focusing on the space and time is far more productive than focusing on people. We like working with a team of students, teachers, parents, saying, “How can we make the hallway safer?” So actually mapping violent hotspots and then interviewing people and sharing that with the whole community has been a very effective tool in finding out where these hotspot places are.
 
 
DT: What do you hope to ultimately accomplish with your research on school violence?
Astor: Less pain and suffering and more happiness amongst children and teachers and people who make the whole social and learning experience in school a better one.  If you have a reduction of 10 percent less fights and weapon use, that’s a lot less pain and suffering that victims have to feel and communities have to deal with.

Social media seems to have made people less engaged with their immediate surroundings, but Katya Ognyanova and Nancy Chen, both Ph.D. candidates at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, want to use social media to bring a community together.
Ognyanova and Chen are researching ways to use new media to promote civic engagement in Alhambra, a city where residents seem to have lost their sense of belonging.
Katya Ognyanova | Daily Trojan
Because Alhambra is ethnically diverse, its residents do not have common news sources or a way to get information in a consistent and useful way, which, according to Ognyanova, makes it difficult for them to collectively imagine their community.
Enter Alhambra Source.
Ognyanova, Chen and other communication researchers, including both students and professors at Annenberg’s Metamorphosis group, conducted focus groups, surveys, media monitoring and interviews to see how the various residents in Alhambra get their news and information, and how they feel toward their community. This research started about three years ago, and culminated eight months ago, with the launch of a new website,
AlhambraSource.org, which provides a common news outlet for Alhambra residents.
“It’s not just about research, it’s about that research being translated into practice; how research has a real impact on the community,” Chen said.
The website provides news in three different languages (English, Spanish and Chinese) to reach out to the ethnically diverse community. It gives the residents a common resource to share information and feel connected to their surrounding community.
The main goal of the project, which won first place in the social sciences category at the GPSS Poster Symposium in early April, is to promote dialogue and interaction across ethnic lines in the city of Alhambra, according to its
developers.
Ognyanova and Chen hope the website will function as a place where all residents, no matter their race, can come to receive and comment on the local news happening in the community. And an increase in the multi-ethnic communication will, they hope, increase levels of neighborhood belonging and community engagement.
“This is a learning experience — we see what works and what doesn’t, and this knowledge can be applied in other communities,” Ognyanova said.
For now, the researchers plan to have about 20-30 Alhambra residents be in charge of contributing to the website. Eventually, though, they want the website to be self-sustaining, where residents completely run the website with distanced support of the research team.

From a video game that guides underprivileged high school students through the college process to the creation of a new concept for high school education, USC’s Rossier School of Education is leading the way in urban education research.
Daily Trojan file photo
Rossier strives to implement its research on urban education into the neighborhoods surrounding USC as well as urban environments across the country. The school focuses on finding creative ways to improve education and professional development.
“We want to use our research to foster an environment where teachers have the skills to educate under-performing students, and at the same time provide them with the individualized attention they deserve,” said Cathryn Dhanatya, assistant dean of research at Rossier.
In March, David Dwyer, a research professor at Rossier, unveiled his plan to construct the USC Hybrid High School, which he hopes will reduce high school dropout rates in urban districts by creating a school schedule conducive to the needs of its students.
The hybrid school model is the culmination of Dwyer’s research on the adversities preventing urban high school students from graduating.
According to Dwyer, 50 percent of students in urban centers drop out of high school. Of those 50 percent, 20 percent are considered “gifted students” and 34 percent dropout because of scheduling conflicts.
“What is conflicting with the typical Monday-Wednesday schedule is that students need to work or provide for their families,” Dwyer said. “When a student becomes 16, from their perspective, it becomes a moral decision whether to stay in school or work to support their family.”
The Hybrid School will be open seven days a week, 10 hours a day, 50 weeks a year to offer students more flexibility in scheduling their classes. The school will also place an emphasis on technology both in the classroom and at home.
“USC Hybrid School will be a school that adopts to the lives and needs of the students rather than forcing students into a model presented by traditional schools,” Dwyer said.
Dwyer is currently searching for a location in the USC neighborhood for the Hybrid School, but hopes to expand the model throughout Los Angeles in the next three years — and eventually across the country.
Rossier, in conjunction with USC’s Game Innovation Lab, is also trying to create an interactive and captivating video game, Pathfinder, to guide urban students through the college process.
According to Zoe Corwin, a postdoctoral research associate at Rossier, qualified, underserved students are often outperformed by their higher-income counterparts in the college process because of a lack of resources. Pathfinder hopes to reach out to these students and give them a better understanding of the college process.
Through qualitative research led by Bill Tierney, director of Rossier’s Center for Higher Education Policy and Analysis, it was determined students are more apt to learn from challenges presented, for example, by video games.
“For over a decade we have been looking at what makes a successful college prep program,” Corwin said. “We have learned that students learn best through challenges and that led us to choose a video game format for Pathfinder.”
In 2008 CHEPA was awarded an $800,000 grant from then-Provost C. L. Max Nikias to transform Pathfinder from a card game to a video game. CHEPA has received an additional $1.45 million from the U.S. Department of Education to create a Facebook game.
Rossier is comprised of six research centers with 24 tenure and tenure-line faculty and eight research track faculty.
For the 2009-2010 fiscal year, Rossier’s research funding totaled $17,532,211, a majority of which came from grants and private foundations.

Viterbi’s research varies as much as the global problems it aims to solve. The school’s engineers address topics like sustainability, multimedia communications, health technology and homeland security.
The focus on interdisciplinary research gives Viterbi a chance to grow in a variety of directions, collaborating with nearly every school on campus. Their administration works to support these collaborations, so that they will remain intact and fruitful.
Maja Mataric, senior associate dean for research, said interdisciplinary research is one of academia’s biggest trends, and every school will say their faculty is involved with it. Viterbi focuses on hiring strong faculty, from which quality research will follow.
“We don’t tell our faculty where they should research,” Mataric said. “Where research happens is bottom-up, because they know where the field is headed.”
Viterbi’s hiring of “talented and enthusiastic Ph.D.s” as one of the key factors in its rise in national rankings, according to Mataric.
Viterbi’s faculty is growing rapidly, as more than 30 of its 169 members joined USC in the past three years.
Mataric said although a variety of factors go into a faculty member’s decision to join USC, getting rising stars in the field increases the caliber of those who want to join the Trojan family.
“They send in more and more proposals on their own,” Mataric said. “We don’t need to push for more research because they increase the amount of research they work on.”
The creation of the Health, Technology and Engineering program this year, in partnership with the Keck Medical School, demonstrates how Viterbi will pursue and maintain the interdisciplinary research faculty are interested in.
George Tolomiczenko, HTE@USC administrative director, said interdisciplinary collaborations pull research into the real world because they address problems that are too complex to be solved by a team with the same background.
“The pull comes from problems that need interdisciplinary teams that need to find solutions, and the push comes from leadership at USC that knows that this is the way to advance research both basic and applied,” Tolomiczenko said.
The program not only produces research, but specifically caters to graduate students who want to pursue medical research from either the engineering or medical side.
“We’re trying to empower and equip students from both engineering and the medical side to be very active members of collaborative and interdisciplinary teams,” Tolomiczenko said. “We want to do that by starting that joint effort very early in their training.”
Viterbi boasts two National Science Foundation-funded engineering research centers — one of only four universities in the country to do so. The Integrated Media Systems Center was established in 1996 and renewed in 2001 and the Biomimetic MicroElectronic Systems Center was established in 2003.
Cyrus Shahabi, director of the IMSC, said the research centers reflect the growing trend for interdisciplinary research.
“The push was from having a single principal investigator doing research on one topic – and we just go on a small amount of money — to having multi-PI, multi-school, large centers, going after large grants,” Shahabi said. “It’s making sure the school of engineering is ‘engineering plus.’ It’s engineering plus communication, or plus health, and makes engineering an enabler for solving problems in all these other areas. ”
At the same time, he said, doing interdisciplinary research is a way to address specific problems and not an end to itself.
“We respond to things where we think there is a value we can add,” Shahabi said. “[Data management] is kind of a good area to be in, because everybody’s collecting data and everyone needs to deal with it.”

Most people attend business school to learn practical skills to help them succeed in the profession.
Daily Trojan
But at USC, finding new ways to succeed is just as important as learning the tried and true methods.
Marshall School of Business currently ranks No. 12 in the University of Texas Dallas’ Top 100 World Rankings of Business Schools based on research contributions 2006-2010, and No. 11 in UTD’s North American Rankings.
“The goal of what we do is to provide new knowledge,” said Deborah MacInnis, vice dean for research and strategy. “It’s not just about taking existing knowledge and applying it to a business or business situation.”
As expected, for research reports to get published in the top-tier academic journals, the research needs to yield cutting-edge, significant discoveries. It seems Marshall has had no problems with this, as its faculty research results have been picked up by CNN, Fox News, Forbes, Business Week and the Wall Street Journal.
The money for Marshall research comes from a variety of sources: grants, resources from the school — which are limited — foundations and corporations that want to become more knowledgeable about certain things.
USC has been able to hold its own in the midst of that competition by attracting a stellar faculty with its resources.
“We’ve been able to hire faculty from Stanford, Wharton, Northwestern, Harvard and other top schools around the country,” MacInnis said. “Our research environment and the resources we have really draw people here.”
Some of those resources include presentations, funding opportunities, and Center for Excellence in Research workshops that provide training and forums on how to write persuasive proposals, how to assess federal research opportunities and how to develop funded research programs among other topics. USC is also working on a new software system which will simplify all aspects of research administration.
These resources primarily assist faculty members and graduate students, who do the majority of the research at Marshall.
“Students can do undergraduate work with faculty members, but right now the research is based on an independent study basis,” MacInnis said.
Because Marshall has seven different academic areas, a very diverse faculty and no wish to stifle research creativity, it’s difficult to give a general overview of everything currently being researched.
“We don’t as a school direct our faculty to do certain kinds of research. Our faculty does the research that they’re passionate about,” MacInnis said.
What people might find most relatable, however, is the research done in marketing that focuses on consumer behavior.
A recent study focusing on the strength of brand attachment and its results was published by MacInnis, C. Whan Park, professor of marketing, and Joseph Priester, associate professor of marketing. The study found that people develop emotional bonds with brands like Apple, and are willing to spend more money and go out of their way to acquire them.
Marshall also has multiple Centers of Excellence that focus on specific components of business, such as entrepreneurship, investment, innovation and branding research.
The Center for Global Innovation, for example, focuses on market data and studies the nature of consumers, businesses and nations. The Center is currently researching subjects like predicting takeoff and sales of new products, how technologies evolve, designing new products from web chatter and whether or not firms should make or buy innovations.
There is also research on what makes advertisements successful as well as on investment decisions, the impact of the external environment on business and vice versa. Other projects include figuring out how to design a machine that can bargain successfully with people.
“All of us believe that we are students for life. We are never done. We are constantly learning and constantly trying to see what coming next,” MacInnis said.

From immersive virtual reality to 3-D imaging, the research conducted at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts doesn’t focus solely on the cinema industry, but pioneers technologies used in other fields, including engineering, architecture and medicine.
Daily Trojan
“People don’t realize that much is going on here in terms of research, but in fact there’s a lot,” said Scott Fisher, associate dean for research and founding chair of the Interactive Media Division at SCA. “We’ve got collaborations worldwide.”
In the Interactive Media Division alone, Fisher said, the school has received funding from companies like Sony, Nokia and Google to pioneer new technology and applications for their existing software, including panoramic camera technologies and a program that looks to sync personal photos to Google Earth.
“Faculty and students at SCA are conducting research in areas of game innovation, interactive storytelling, social media, mobile technologies, 3-D visualization and many other areas,” said Marientina Gotsis, a research assistant professor who leads the Interactive Media Division’s Games for Health Initiative, a program designed to connect health professionals with various forms of interactive media. “Projects tend to be very diverse and interdisciplinary with collaboration with architecture, health, communications, medicine, neuroscience, biology, mathematics, history and more.”
Elizabeth Daley, dean of the School of Cinematic Arts, said it’s this diverse interdisciplinary work that has propelled SCA to the top.
“We’re pushing to innovate,” Daley said. “What everybody here is interested in is innovation. Ultimately what you value — in cinema too, for that matter — you’re not looking for things that can be replicated. So innovation and originality are the criteria by which we live.”
Though some of the research conducted does improve on existing technologies, one professor noted the only way to stay relevant is to do research that goes beyond what’s happening today.
“We’re looking at things that we don’t quite understand yet, which means by definition we’re out in front and that’s why I think research is critical to any school,” said Mark Bolas, associate professor and director of the INIT Lab at SCA. “My students are going to graduate in a couple of years and I want them to be experts in whatever job they’re going to have in five to six years from now.”
According to Bolas, being ahead of the game is what has gotten SCA its top ranking.
“If you’re number one, you paint a target on your back,” Bolas said. “So the only way to stay number one is to actually be ahead, to be in front of yourself, to be running so fast you don’t even know where you’re going … If you’re looking at what’s here now, you’re number two. You’re looking at the other guy’s back.”
Being number one also means SCA is often sought out by major corporations looking to fund research.
“There’s been a grant from Microsoft, Electronic Arts, we’ve had support from HP, we’ve had support from the MacArthur Foundation, so it runs quite a gamut,” Daley said. “Research always comes from outside grants. The university also has their own research grants that our faculty applies for that they’ve done quite well with.”
Those involved in research also appreciate the support they receive from the school.
“Right now, technological innovations are happening at an exponential rate … So the school has to exponentially increase their commitment to research just to keep up,” Bolas said. “So far they’re pulling that off.”
But in the end, Daley said, the importance of the school’s ranking is in part seen in the quality of students it attracts.
“Most of the students that come here want to be dealing with new things,” Daley said. “I think the fact that we have a games program, that we do 3-D, these are all things that are very attractive to students.”
 
If you want to get a job at Warner Brothers or Disney then great, go ahead, enroll and spend hundreds on student film projects that structurally inhibit individual voices.
Man this thing is i think not fair
The USC film “school” is not a school: it’s a well-funded factory for industry transplants. 
If you want to get a job at Warner Brothers or Disney then great, go ahead, enroll and spend hundreds on student film projects that structurally inhibit individual voices. 
Just stop for a minute and think about the state of American film studios these days. Budgets are ballooning, theater attendance is down and before long, there’s going to be fundamental change in the kind of movies we make and how we make them. 
As a former film major, I can attest that leaving the SCA program was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Doing so allowed me a multitude of experiences – both in and out of the classroom – that would have been logistically impossible had I stayed in the major. Anyone can learn how to shoot and edit a film, but it’s life experience and education that makes for interesting pictures.
Get out and about. Take classes that purely interest you. Talk to strangers. Travel outside the USA when possible. The most interesting contemporary filmmakers come from unorthodox backgrounds. Yes, you’ll have to work harder to fund your first project, but you’ll be in a better place from which to start a project. 
If nothing else, at least ask yourself why the USC film school hallways are adorned with posters of “Charlie’s Angels”, “The Kid” and similar fare.

In his inaugural address, President C. L. Max Nikias challenged USC to become an undisputed elite university:
“For this university and for our Trojan Family, our own quest … means the difference between being a “hot” and “up-and-coming” university and being undisputedly one of the most elite and influential institutions in the world.”
In response to Nikias’ challenge, Provost Elizabeth Garrett has launched a plan to transform departments and programs in the humanities and social sciences.
This program, said Executive Vice Provost Michael Quick, has the potential to bring USC to the next level.
“We have some good programs [at USC] and we want to work with them and their various deans to really move them to the top in the world,” Quick said. “By doing that we are putting ourselves in the top tier.”
Faculty review committees have been established to determine which departments should be selected. Two separate advisory committees have been formed, one for the social sciences and one for the humanities.
The provost’s office has called on departments throughout USC to submit proposals outlining how distinction and additional funding could propel them to the top of their fields. Departments will have to consult outside sources to identify faculty they would hire and research they would pursue if they are selected as transformative departments by the provost’s office.
The transforming departments program is a permanent change in the operations of the university, according to Quick.
“This is how we are going to be doing things from now on,” he said.
Hiring the best
One of the ways the program seeks to enhance USC’s programs is by enabling the hiring of esteemed faculty.
Dana Goldman, a member of the Provost’s Social Science Advisory Committee and a professor at the School of Policy, Planning, and Development, said faculty members are critical to paving the way for greater global recognition.
“With the appropriate investments, [a department] can be immediately recognized as a national leader in various areas,” Goldman said. “Hiring good junior [faculty] is an important way for USC to play a significant role on the national stage.”
Quick is confident USC can find the country’s best faculty because of the improvements it has made in the undergraduate programs.
“A lot of resources and energy has been put into the undergraduate education and it shows through USC’s rising in the rankings,” Quick said. “Doing the same with the faculty is the next step we need to take.”
Healthy competition
The provost’s program will greatly influence undergraduate and graduate education.
“[The provost’s program] will cause a ripple effect across campus,” Quick said. “Graduate students want to study with the top scholars across the country, and higher caliber graduate programs end up affecting undergraduate students.”
Undergraduates will be directly impacted as the selected departments will attract better teaching assistants, who are typically graduate students.
Goldman believes the program will also impact programs that are not selected. The program, he noted, creates healthy competition between departments, but also encourages interdisciplinary work, which can benefit all departments.
Goldman, who directs the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health and Policy Economics, an interdisciplinary research center, said he thinks the program will present a myriad of new opportunities.
“We are finding ways that we can have USC excel in areas that it has previously not,” Goldman said. “It will jump-start broad avenues of research that will have broad percussions for all departments”
Quick does not think there will be negative ramifications for departments not selected. He maintains that any department has the opportunity to become a transformative department.
“If [a department] makes a case that it can be great and internal faculty committees think that is the case, we are going to go with it,” Quick said. “Everyone has the opportunity to play.”
Philosophically speaking
Scott Soames, director of the department of philosophy, recently applied the philosophy department for recognition as a transformative department.
In the philosophy department’s application, Soames highlighted the current research being conducted at the department’s various centers including its Center for Philosophy and Language, as well as the department’s strengths in early modern philosophy and formal epistemology.
If recognized by the Provost’s office, Soames hopes to hire new faculty and establish a two-year postdoctoral fellowship program, which will help strengthen the department’s current curriculum and enhance its graduate programs. Soames also intends to expand the department’s philosophy, politics, and law major.
According to Soames, an emphasis on the undergraduate level is crucial for the university’s scholarly growth.
“The university as a whole is trying very hard to establish itself as an elite university research institution in all respect and a top-flight bachelor’s degree program is vital,” Soames said.
Quick looks forward to evaluating the applications for the transformative departments program.
“I hope that we get so many great proposals that we have to work hard to find the money [to fund departments],” Quick said. “As far as we are concerned that is a great challenge to have.”

Whether it’s about learning as much possible as or having something substantial to put on a résumé, research is on the minds of many undergraduate students.
Daily Trojan
Research opportunities are traditionally easy to find in the natural sciences and engineering, as research is an obvious step for students pursuing these fields.
But lately there has been a push for more undergraduate research in other areas — particularly within the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
“We’re trying to increase the number of people doing research in the humanities. It seems to be a lot easier for the kids in the social sciences and sciences,” said Steven Lamy, vice dean for Academic Programs for the Dornsife College.
Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs, said for students in science and engineering, research “is a critical part of their preparation.” But
undergraduate research can enhance the college experience of any student.
“Whether you’re in the humanities or the sciences, working with an expert is one of the best ways to learn,” Bickers said.
 
‘It stimulates my brain’
Jenna Katherine Ross, a junior majoring in history, is currently assisting professor Peter Mancall on his upcoming volume about colonial North America. Ross explained her role involves reading through anthropological articles and investigating Inuit folklore to try to capture the Inuit identity.
“The best aspect of conducting the research is the way it stimulates my brain,” she said. “The professors rely on me to not only find, but interpret information, and they use what I collect in their professional work. Accordingly, I think really hard about everything that I’m doing, and I’ve found that I’ve learned so much — my ability to analyze historical information has increased, and I’m beginning to feel more like a real historian, and less like a
student.”
 
Finding the funds
The university has taken steps recently in the hopes that more undergrads will learn what it’s like to be a real researcher.
“The College has always had some funding for undergraduate research, but not an established program with dedicated funds,” said Lamy, who became vice dean for Academic Programs in 2008. “So, when Dean Gilman became the dean of the College and I became the vice dean for Academic Programs, we decided that was going to be one of our priorities.”
The Student Opportunities for Academic Research and Summer Undergraduate Research Fund both provide research stipends — $1,000 for SOAR and $3,000 for SURF — for undergraduate research. When the programs were launched, Dornsife  College gave away $50,000 in research funding. Now, the programs sponsor more than $100,000 worth of undergraduate research in a year.
“Over four years we’ve given away $648,000,” Lamy said. “I don’t think there’s any other institution in the United States that can say that.”
The College isn’t just providing funding for research — it is also providing structured programs for students who might be unsure of where to
begin.
The Problems Without Passports program gives undergraduate students the opportunity to do problem-based inquiry research in foreign countries. The program is limited to undergraduate students — partly so they won’t be intimidated by competing for spots with more research-savvy graduate students — and can be paid for with SURF funding.
“We wanted to create a vehicle for undergraduate students to get involved right away,” Lamy said.
In past years, students have done everything from interviewing survivors of the killing fields in Cambodia to studying healing in Brazil. This year, undergraduates will have the opportunity to research global health in Oxford, England, the effect of climate and environmental change on the ancient Mayan civilization in Belize, and possibly the politics of indigenous language in Ireland.
 
‘We expect the numbers to grow’
SOAR and SURF have increased funding opportunities for undergraduate research, but there are a number of other possibilities.
Several departments, such as international relations, have their own funds to distribute for undergraduate research. Individual schools often have their own funds, too.
There are also several university-wide funding sources.
Last summer more than 70 students conducted research funded by the Rose Hills Foundation, which grants fellowships of $5,000 each, according to Bickers. More than 50 students received $3,000 stipends from the Provost’s Research Fellowship last summer, and an additional 100 students received $1,000 fellowships in the fall. An additional 150 students received funding from the Undergraduate Research Associates Program.
“We expect the numbers to grow this coming year,” Bickers said.
Typically, about 70 percent of research proposals are accepted, Bickers said; proposals are generally rejected because they lack detail.
Still, the university is hoping to increase the percentage of proposals it can approve, and new sources of funding are always being sought.
 
Inquiring minds
Though these programs and fellowships have helped increase the number of undergraduates involved in research, Lamy said the College is still looking for ways to engage students in humanities research specifically.
Finding a research project can be more difficult for students in the humanities, but Bickers encourages students to be curious and seek out opportunities.
“One of the best ways to learn about humanities research is to visit with a faculty member during office hours and inquire — often,” he said.
Andrew Jones, a senior majoring in history who is also assisting Mancall with his book, said being proactive is critical.
“My perception is that there’s a grant out there for anyone who has the imagination and dedication to come up with a project,” Jones said. “In the history department, I’ve been lucky to have professors eager to introduce students to research opportunities. But ultimately students must take initiative, which is how it should be.”

The path to a permanent place in the ivory tower has traditionally consisted of long, solitary nights spent poring over books or data or code, looking for a pattern no one else has spotted before, hoping — maybe even praying — that the days, weeks and months of painstaking research will culminate in publication in a major journal.
In its push to be a leader in cutting-edge research, USC is looking to break that mold.
The researcher of the future, at least at USC, will do significant collaborative work that spans specialties and disciplines, and will publish their findings in some form other than print — what form, exactly, is still being researched — according to Randolph Hall, USC’s senior vice president for research.
“The digital world is changing how we do research,” Hall said. “It’s changing the way faculty and students work with each other — it’s becoming more synchronous and collaborative.”
The university’s research programs have consistently placed USC among the top 20 research institutions in the country in the past few years. But USC is not content with consistency. It wants to drive forward, to venture into uncharted territory.
That’s where Hall comes in. Aside from ensuring all university research adheres to ethical and legal standards, Hall is responsible for research advancement, which boils down to, as he puts it, “finding new faculty or new people or supporting faculty to do new things.”
Most of the funding for those pursuits comes from the federal government, specifically organizations like the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health. For the 2010 fiscal year, the university received $560.9 million in sponsored research funding, and more than 70 percent of that money was in the form of federal research grants.
The latest federal budget details significant cuts to research — NIH funding would be cut by $260 million and NSF funding by $53 million. At USC, this translates into a loss of about $4 million, or a 1 percent decrease, according to Hall.
The key to sustaining research amid federal budget cuts is to remain ahead of the increasingly cutthroat competition. Hall lists four broad areas of focus at USC he expects will keep the university competitive in the quest for grants: biomedicine and health, energy and environmental topics, inquiries into how humans interact with each other, and information science.
This last area, Hall says, is the one in which USC really has the chance to excel.
Information science, at its core, is research into how we do research. The digital revolution has brought with it a whole host of new techniques for sharing and disseminating information, and USC researchers are looking for ways these techniques can be integrated into every discipline. Much of this work is being done by the Institute for Creative Technology and by researchers in the Visual Studies Program.
The advent of digital technologies has also facilitated a move toward collaborative research — a trend that has been particularly pronounced at USC.
“It seems to be that USC has blossomed in this way as collaborative research is proving to produce more interesting scholarship and more interesting questions,” said Phil Ethington, a professor of history who conducts interdisciplinary research on global metropolises. “It’s just not possible in a lifetime to master enough disciplines to do it yourself.”
Collaboration can come in many forms. It can mean working with colleagues within one department, or branching out to work with researchers in a completely different field. USC fosters and encourages both.
Last year, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, launched a program called College 2020 that provides money to faculty members who propose research projects that transcend traditional departmental boundaries and aim to answer questions relevant to society. The research projects selected to receive funding this year will investigate topics like the effects of downturn and recovery on the brain and how to enhance education on immigrant integration. The first project alone will bring together researchers from six different fields, including psychology, political science, business, neuroscience, education and law. USC also has a number of interdisciplinary research centers.
Though collaboration has been standard practice in the natural sciences for some time, it is relatively new to the humanities and, to some extent, the social sciences. Ethington emphasized that there are useful ways for humanities scholars to collaborate, if they are willing.
For instance, he said, an art historian could work with a neuroscientist who understands how people process visual information. The two together can provide a unique analysis of the significance of a piece of art in a certain time period or to a certain people.
The sciences and humanities don’t always embrace each other, however. This gap often makes scholars from one discipline wary of working with scholars from the other.
But the bigger obstacle in fostering collaboration at USC has been the standards set by academe, Hall said.
A critical issue for most researchers is how to earn tenure and how to get promoted. Traditionally, professors have been evaluated based on individual contributions to the field, but USC recently rewrote its guidelines to accommodate — and encourage — collaboration.
The University Committee on Appointment, Promotion and Tenure revised its manual earlier this year to include information about how to evaluate collaborative research when considering a candidate for tenure or a promotion.
Hall’s office also launched a program called Creativity and Collaboration in the Academy last December, which aims to show professors how research can benefit them. Hall is hoping to get NSF funding for the program this year.
Additionally, the University Research Committee, which is chaired by Ethington, drafted guidelines for attributing collaborative research. These guidelines, which emphasize intellectual contribution, were passed by the Academic Senate on Wednesday.
“There’s a leftover standard of a single scholar model, at least for evaluating people,” Ethington said. “That’s where we were running into a roadblock, because the traditional standards in the university were still saying you just have to impress your own field … Motivation can depend on how you get credit.”
Though the university has taken steps to invite collaboration, which it believes is the key to being at the forefront of research, it remains to be seen if the culture can truly be changed –— but Hall is working on it.
“We want a structure to encourage them,” he said. “We don’t want any artificial barriers.”

On April 24, the cast of the Broadway production of Green Day’s American Idiot took the stage for the last time. Joined by Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong who had reprised his role of Saint Jimmy for the past three weeks, the play’s successful Broadway run is now complete after 421 performances, 27 previews, one Grammy win for “ Best Musical Show Album” and one Tony Award win for “Best Musical.”
The play, directed by Michael Mayer and written by Billie Joe Armstrong, first began production in Berkeley, California in September of 2009 to solid reviews. By March 24,2010, the play had taken to the Broadway stage for preview performances before officially starting on April 20, 2010.
Now, just a little over a year later, the cast members took their final bows in an emotional farewell to Broadway and to the Saint James Theater. Director Michael Mayer along with other producers of the show gave speeches to the sold-out audience thanking them for their support.
Armstrong’s three stints as St. Jimmy propelled ticket sales but their decline in his absence is what led to the closing of the production.
Fans who came to the final performance, however, were treated to one last surprise in addition to the speeches and appearances of original cast members like John Gallagher Jr., who played the main role of Johnny for all of the productions.
After the speeches, Green Day itself took the stage to play a ten song set that included older tracks like “Burnout” and “Longview” from their 1994 album Dookie. They ultimately concluded their set with Armstrong declaring “This whole experience has been surreal…I never thought I’d see my bedroom on a Broadway stage” before diving into the track that the whole musical revolves around “Jesus of Suburbia.”
Upon the song’s conclusion, Armstrong turned to the cast behind him and bowed, and the actors reciprocated. With that event, American Idiot’s stint on Broadway ended.
Fans who did not get to see the show still have reason to be excited, though, because starting in December, it will begin a nationwide tour in Toronto that will take it to cities like Boston, Detroit, St. Louis, Seattle and Dallas. It will take over the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles from March 13 through April 22 in 2012.
Tom Hanks’ production company, Playtone, has also picked up the rights to make a movie based off the record, which will be directed by Michael Mayer.
