Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault, drugging and violence.
The Department of Public Safety received reports of five additional cases of sexual assault and drugging Tuesday, ranging from Nov. 10, 2018 to Oct. 23, 2021. 
DPS received additional reports of sexual assault and drugging since Thursday — including at fraternities other than Sigma Nu— according to a Saturday communitywide email. 
Of the five additional cases filed in the log, two occurred on the Row, one occurred off the Row and the other locations for two reports were not specified. Two of the reports include accusations of drugging, two include accusations of sexual assault and one includes an accusation of drugging followed by sexual assault.
The report on Nov. 10, 2018 occurred at the Sigma Nu Fraternity, where students have protested for the past week following reports of sexual assault from September and October 2021. In the 2018 report, a student said she was drugged at a party on the property.
Another report included allegations at the Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity house on Sept. 29, 2021. A parent “informed by a third party” reported to DPS that two students were drugged and then sexually assaulted while at a party in the house.
Two additional reports — with unspecified locations — report accusations of sexual assault, one on Sept. 26, 2021 and another on Oct. 23, 202.
Off the Row, a student reported he was drugged while attending a party at 1000 Block 21st St., an off-campus housing property.
Following Wednesday’s sexual assault reports, students have protested for five consecutive days on the Row. While most protesters directed frustration at Sigma Nu, students also addressed other fraternities as additional reports surfaced and students criticized the systemic issues within Greek life. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, the Sigma Nu Fraternity headquarters said they were not previously aware of the new report, and will seek “additional information about the report from USC officials” and “an appropriate investigation.”
DPS referred the Daily Trojan to the Los Angeles Police Department. LAPD, the Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity headquarters and the Phi Kappa Tau USC chapter did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.
Editor’s note: The story will be updated with additional comments.

“Eddie on Aux” is a biweekly series on a few songs that intrigue me. They don’t have to be earth-shattering or terrible, just something interesting enough to warrant an article. It is not a recommendation of what to play in the car to impress your friends, despite what the title suggests. 
THE ANXIETY— “Meet Me At Our Spot”
Like everything else in this world that’s been McKinsey-fied, the TikTok-song factory has the art of hitmaking down to a science. In this machine, the complexity of human experience is simplified to a few marketable emotions. Like fast food, the songs are meant to be downed easily, and the resulting satisfaction is quick. Consider Lil Nas X and Doja Cat, the two greatest practitioners of the app, making music that fires straight into our neural synapses, effortlessly triggering temporary highs. 
“Meet Me At Our Spot,” though undoubtedly a TikTok song, finds popularity through a different formula. If the pop machine is cheap drugs, then the alternative vibes that THE ANXIETY shamelessly trafficks in are a more refined intoxicant. It feels classier (read: bougie), a little more special, and unlike the pop music catered to the masses, these alt-genres have a counterculture streak and the premise of individuality. 
This also seems to be what Willow Smith — one half of THE ANXIETY alongside partner Tyler Cole — craves as well. Born a celebrity as the daughter of Will and Jada Smith and a charting artist at just 10 years old, Smith’s recent music has been her exploration of finding a space and identity outside of traditional fame. 
But “Meet Me At Our Spot,” like most alternative TikTok songs, is all fluff and no substance. Vague mentions of places (“our spot”) and moods (“caught a vibe”) fill the song with an incredible lack of specificity, making it relatable to everyone and no one at the same time. The abstractness makes for ideal background music to the transactionalized lived experience; a soundtrack for all the picnic and sunset videos and obligatory posts of the beach. Like this TikTok-inspired generation, “Meet Me At Our Spot” tries to search for meaning, but misses the point entirely.
Young Thug — “Die Slow”
Young Thug is in this weird zone where anybody that cares even a little bit about hip-hop regards him as one of the greats. Yet from a distance, he’s still generally underappreciated. He’s arguably the most influential hip-hop artist of the last decade, but in terms of name recognition, Thug isn’t quite the superstar Drake or Kanye West are, and even a peer such as Future has more cachet. Though only 30, he’s already passed the torch to the likes of Lil Baby and Gunna — artists he once mentored.
Nevertheless, Young Thug continues, as prolific and great as ever. His career momentum has never subsided; he’s put out multiple projects every year and appeared as a feature on countless others. At times, Thug grooves on autopilot with his raps flaunting expensive jewels, designer brands and his eventful lifestyle, but on “Die Slow,” he takes time to reflect. 
Thug thinks about his suite along the Venice Canals, where he’s recording the song. He thinks about his tour and how he missed his son’s birthday because of it, and it spirals into a wild story about family troubles and a couple sheriffs. I’ve always felt that Thug is the type of person, like the adventurous uncle at a family gathering, to have an archive full of wild, fanciful stories. Not only does he have the experience, but he’s also a master storyteller.
But the most heartfelt parts of “Die Slow” are when Thug is the most introspective. “If you want it, you gon’ get up earlier than anyone,” he raps, but not as advice. It’s a justification for him to enjoy the moment, at literal and figurative heights: “I’m high enough to be on the Milky Way til morning.” If only for a brief moment, Thug unwinds, before embarking on his next show or next project.
RTB MB — “AF1”
RTB MB also goes by Miles Bridges; you may have heard of him. When he isn’t in the studio, he moonlights as one of the NBA’s better young talents, a 6-foot-6 wing with incredible hops and a budding game. He’s best known as LaMelo Ball’s alley-oop partner of choice, whose dunks make the Charlotte Hornets announcer yell wild things on television. Oh, and he dropped 30 points the other night.
There are already enough NBA players trying to cross over into music (and celebrities too, Dwayne Johnson’s feature is a certified ear-bleeder). LeBron James was credited as an A&R on 2 Chainz’ “Rap Or Go To The League,” despite consistently not knowing the lyrics to songs. The ever-mysterious Kawhi Leonard brought together an eclectic mix of rappers for his “Culture Jam” project. Among those who step behind the mic, Damian Lillard is the most notable hooper, and probably the only one who’s taken even half-seriously. Sure, Lillard doesn’t sound out of place, but once you get past the novelty of him being a superstar athlete, there’s not much else there.
But with Bridges, he’s got it down. A native of Flint, he sticks close to his roots and the Michigan sound — playful, punchline-heavy and allergic to the beat. “AF1” has the energy of a SoundCloud submission all the way down to the amateur sound mixing. Bridges goes rapid-fire and lands with most of his bars. “Shot 77 out the 100 rounds, Luka Doncic,” drew a chuckle. 
Given the quality of music that comes out of the league, the title of “Best Rapper in the NBA” is mostly a meaningless one. But it goes to Bridges; it’ll be fun to follow this side quest as his career progresses.

Lana Del Rey released her eighth studio album on Friday titled “Blue Banisters.” The album follows the early 2021 release of her album “Chemtrails Over The Country Club,” as well as a streak of controversy surrounding the pop singer.
From degrading insinuations about women-identifying artists of color posted on her social media to a seemingly negligent approach to coronavirus safety, Del Rey’s reputation has seen a sharp decline following the career-high praise of her 2019 album “Norman Fucking Rockwell.” 
The string of controversies was made worse by Del Rey’s apparent need to over explain, the multitude of stubborn attempts to defend herself, often backfiring into further damage. 
“Blue Banisters” may be an extension to the explanation, sharpened by its plea for listeners to see through the muck of controversy and into what Del Rey deems her well-intentioned soul. 
The album features a handful of songs written years prior, which have been teased in leaked snippets on Tumblr or Instagram videos that were later deleted. Four of the album’s tracks were written in 2013 and 2014, recorded for but ultimately left off of “Ultraviolence,” Del Rey’s third studio album. 
Del Rey’s inclusion of songs from a previous era of her music seems to be an attempt to call fans back to a time when their respect for her was still high, like scattered proof that an unproblematic Lana had existed before this new, highly-criticized one. 
The old songs are snuck into a 15-song tracklist that also features an abundance of new work. These new songs scream of the frustrations and anxieties that have resulted from years in the spotlight with more striking emotion and deeper glimpses into the artist’s personal life than has been seen in any of her previous work. 
Unlike the gilded Hollywood aesthetic of Del Rey’s early albums, “Blue Banisters” brings a lens to the personal struggles we haven’t been allowed to see before. The inclusion of such intimate details is Del Rey’s method of rejecting the conclusions drawn from her various controversies, insisting instead on her “true” persona as presented in the album. 
In “Wildflower Wildfire,” Del Rey confesses to problems she experienced in her youth with her mother, which led to Del Rey’s hospitalization and a subsequent numbing from lithium medication. The song likens Del Rey to a persistent wildflower, while expressing a hope that she may never grow into something destructive: “Baby, I’ll be like a wildflower / I live on sheer willpower / I’ll do my best never to turn into something / That burns, burns, burns.” 
In “Arcadia,” Del Rey claims her love for Los Angeles but admits to the hardships she’s had to navigate since falling in love with the city, ultimately ending with a decision to leave it behind. 
“They built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down / so I’m leavin’ with nothing but laughter and this town,” says Del Rey before tossing in a petty addendum to round out the song: “I’m leavin’ them as I was, five-foot-eight Western belt / plus the hate that they gave / by the way, thanks for that.”
The titular track “Blue Banisters” expresses Del Rey’s anxieties about life as an artist as well as fears for the world in general. Over the steady deep notes of a simple piano accompaniment, Del Rey sings, “You can’t be a muse and be happy, too.” She then squeezes out, in a more timid voice, “And that scared me.” 
Later in the song, Del Rey breaks from the timidness and lets escape a plainly stated fear, nearly strangled with emotion: “I’m scared of the Santa Clarita Fires / I wish that it would rain.” 
Del Rey releases a rawness of emotion into “Blue Banister’s” vocals that has not been seen in her earlier works, further exemplifying her desire to be truly seen through the album. 
In “Black Bathing Suit,” Del Rey expresses her frustration with the criticism she’s received through vocal twists that emerge jarringly in the outro. “Oh, let ‘em talk about me!” she cries from a distance, then closer, louder and nearly sobbing: “Mail me when you get the blues.” 
The most striking emotion comes from “Dealer,” a duet with artist Miles Kane that bemoans a toxic relationship with a dealer. Though Kane commandeers the verses, Del Rey enters for a striking chorus, her voice taking charge easily with its jolting abundance of emotion. 
The lyrics, though assumedly pointed at the dealer, could be interpreted as written for Del Rey’s critics, as if she is yelling her extreme frustrations directly at them: “I don’t want to live! / I don’t want to give you nothing / ‘Cause you never give me nothing back. / Why can’t you be good for something? / Not one shirt off your back.” The emotion packed into Del Rey’s voice throughout the album is remarkable in its versatility. From the anguish of “Dealer” to the dry sarcasm of “Sweet Carolina,” Del Rey proves with “Blue Banisters” just how well she can express the tumultuousness of her feelings in her music. 
“Blue Banisters” attempts to convince a diminishing fan base that the old Lana Del Rey still exists beneath the controversy and that the present one is a complex person with real struggles and good intentions. But if the album succeeds at anything, it’s proving Del Rey’s vocal power and lyrical poetics, which have maintained prevalence through eight albums. 
Wrongdoings not forgotten, the album speaks adeptly to the ever-evolving mythology surrounding an artist who, flaws and glamour and all, continues to reinstate herself as an American music icon, for better or for worse.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence.
Hundreds of students gathered on the Row Monday night for the fifth consecutive day of protests following Wednesday’s sexual assault reports filed to the Department of Public Safety. Filling W. 28th St., protestors held signs reading “Time to pay your dues,” “Put your $$ where your mouth is and fight on for sexual assault victims” and “Why won’t Trojan check this?”
Students created signs at USC village around 4 p.m. before they marched on Hoover Street to the Row, blocking traffic and continuing chants of “If you don’t have my consent, you should fear this discontent.”
Some protesters called for the abolition of Greek life at USC, while others said those demands unfairly implicate sororities, urging instead for fraternity reforms and devoted efforts toward combatting instances of sexual assault from the University.
Organized by the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence — a collection of University organizations including USC Flow and the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment — the protest aimed to stand in solidarity with sexual assault victims and address rape culture at USC.
Riddhi Mandavia, the director of education of “Girl Up,” one of the groups that organized the event, said she hopes the protests lead to changes at USC
“There’s no point of doing this every year, every month or every time if there is no conclusion to it and if there’s no real change coming out of it,” said Mandavia, a freshman majoring in psychology. 
On the Row, students — taking up the width of the street — initially stood outside the Sigma Nu house and then moved to other fraternity houses, including Pi Kappa Alpha and Tau Kappa Epsilon. Smaller groups of students then spread out outside different houses on the Row, where speakers spoke about paths forward, including discussions with fraternity members.
“Do we have to explain that it has to be your sister, or it has to be someone that you’re emotionally connected with for you to see us as people?” said Rojan Javaheri, a junior majoring in neuroscience, speaking to a crowd. “I’m very thankful that this is happening … but I’m also a little bit scared because these things happen and then, a month later, nothing else is happening. We’re out here, we’re marching, we’re having conversations. But I really hope that we can turn these conversations into action.”
After four days of protesters placing signs, sitting on the lawn and holding a candlelight vigil outside of the Sigma Nu house, today a gate blocked the property off.
With the house blocked off, students placed signs on the fence that surrounds Sigma Nu’s property.
“We see you. We hear you. We believe you. Believe we standby you. All survivors deserve better,” one sign read.
“Fuck your brotherhood,” another read.
Ashwini Balaganesh, like other protesters, criticized the initial DPS email for placing the responsibility of not being sexually assaulted on the survivors, not perpetrators.
“Losing a drink isn’t what causes rape, walking by yourself doesn’t cause rape. Rapists cause rape,” said Balaganesh, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering.
Brett Landin, a junior majoring in psychology, said the issues of sexual assault and battery extend beyond the Greek life community, and that she came to the protest to express support for survivors and demand University action.
“I hope to see changes not only within Greek life and the fraternity councils, but also just [with] men at USC in general. I think that this isn’t an independent event with one fraternity and one component of USC,” Landin said. “This is men in general, this is sexual assault in general, this is demanding that USC get involved, whether it’s on or off campus.”
Throughout Monday, Instagram accounts such as @uscmetoo detailed additional anonymous sexual assault accusations from USC students, many of which allegedly occurred at fraternities.
One freshman said she went to a fraternity party by herself this year and was drugged then sexually assaulted.
“The whole night is fuzzy …  I only remember snippets. I didn’t realize my drink was laced until I started putting pieces of that night together,” she wrote on the Instagram post. “I had my cup covered with my hand so I thought … Later in the night I just remember not really being able to walk properly and my vision was everywhere.”
In an email late Wednesday night, DPS disclosed a report of sexual assault and drugging at the Sigma Nu fraternity house. The following day, the department reported seven more cases of sexual assault and drugging, six at Sigma Nu and one at an undisclosed location.
Additional reports of sexual assault and druggings occurred at other fraternity houses on the Row, DPS wrote in a communitywide email Saturday. The DPS crime log from Saturday through Monday was not updated in time for publication.
Sexual assault is a larger problem at USC than it is at other Universities, according to a 2019 Association of American Universities study that found nearly one out of three women undergraduates at USC experience sexual assault. According to the study, one out of four undergraduate women at other universities are sexually assaulted.
At the protest Monday, one speaker said she is angry but unsurprised by the sexual assault reports, citing USC’s Greek life culture. 
“I am more than angry. I am livid. I can’t even describe the words to describe how I’m feeling,” she said through a megaphone. “But as devastating as this news is, I think I can speak for everyone when it’s also, unfortunately, not surprising at all.”
Across the country, multiple protests occurred this year at other universities regarding sexual assault at fraternities. At Syracuse University, around 200 students protested outside the Interfraternity Council Chapter following sexual assault reports at fraternities, criticizing systemic issues within fraternities and their Title IX offices. 
At Northwestern University, 2,000 students protested outside their Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity house following multiple reports of druggings.
Hannah Woodworth, executive aid to Undergraduate Student Government President Alexis Areias, said the University can make it easier for survivors to report instances of assault.
“I think having a more direct channel in which victims can report their abuse, in which there is a much faster turnaround time is crucial to making sure survivors receive the help and support and that we can help mitigate the prevalence of this on campus,” said Woodworth, a junior majoring in journalism.
The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to the Daily Trojan Friday that former Sigma Nu President Ryan Schiffilea is the “main suspect” in the Sigma Nu accusations but has not been arrested or charged. 
“I can’t believe that it’s taken us this long to have to come here and I don’t know how much longer it’s going to take before USC starts to give a shit,” said Aastha Jani, a junior majoring in communication. “We need to stand here in solidarity to eventually one day actually abolish the system of Greek life. But at least until then to keep this energy up, to fuck your brotherhood and to hold your brotherhood accountable for what they are and what they are upholding.”
Christina Chkarboul, Bella Durgin-Johnson, Sasha Ryu, Tricia Saputera and Jenna Peterson contributed to this report.

Before Week 1 of the NFL season, there seemed to be a never ending list of potential Super Bowl contenders. The Green Bay Packers, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Los Angeles Rams and the Buffalo Bills were all the talk for sports media, and for good reason. All but the Chiefs are currently well above .500 and likely on their way to the playoffs. 
Kansas City is a mess with a flailing defense and struggling offensive line. In an increasingly competitive AFC West, the Chiefs are fighting for their lives, and right now, they’re losing the battle. 
After appearing in two straight Super Bowls, expectations for the budding dynasty were high. With a reconstructed offensive line, aided by the signing of guard Joe Thuney and newly acquired offensive tackle Orlando Brown, the Chiefs were the favorites to win the Super Bowl going into the season. Now, they might not even win their division. 
The Chiefs have faced a tough schedule thus far in the NFL season, as five of their seven opponents currently hold records above .500. However, with losses to the Ravens, Chargers, Titans and Bills, the Chiefs have yet to prove themselves as legitimate contenders. As my middle school football coach once said, “In order to be the best, you have to beat the best.” Their only impressive win is over a Cleveland Browns team that also hasn’t lived up to the hype. 
The Chiefs’ primary issue this season has been their lackluster defense. Allowing 29.0 points and 404.6 yards per game, the Chiefs have one of the worst defenses in the NFL. This is in stark contrast with last year, when the Chiefs were ranked 11th in points allowed per game. Their defensive woes are widespread. The secondary is lacking in talent; Their pass rush is injured and inefficient and they are one of the most penalized teams in football. 
Instead of spending a first-round pick on running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, the Chiefs should have invested in their defense. Defensive backs Trevon Diggs, who continues to stun the league by intercepting seemingly every pass thrown his way, and Antoine Winfield Jr. were still available and would certainly help the Chiefs out more than Edwards-Helaire has in his brief career. The Chiefs have little opportunity to bolster their defense, and with the Nov. 2 trade deadline quickly approaching, they will have to settle in with the crew they have. 
This is probably the longest a Chiefs-related article has gone without mentioning NFL frontman and Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, so let’s talk about him. While Mahomes is an undeniable talent, he has had a tough time with turnovers so far this season. In fact, Mahomes is tied with Jets rookie quarterback Zach Wilson with 9 interceptions thrown. That’s already three more than he threw over the entirety of last season. 
Mahomes is still putting up impressive numbers, with 18 touchdown passes and almost 2,000 passing yards, but the interceptions have become a serious concern for a team whose subpar defense can’t back up offensive mistakes.
The AFC West is one of the best divisions in football, with the Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers exceeding expectations so far in the season. The future of the Raiders’ season is in jeopardy, as former Head Coach Jon Gruden resigned after an investigation revealed his frequent use of misogynistic and homophobic language. However, the Raiders strung together two dominant victories since Gruden’s departure, posting more than 30 points in each game. 
The Chargers have been one of the most exciting teams this season, as 2020 AFC Rookie of the Year Justin Herbert continues to impress. With a win over the Chiefs already under their belt, the Chargers could be in a great position to win the AFC West. 
The remainder of the Chiefs’ schedule is difficult, and with matchups against the Raiders, Chargers, Packers and Cowboys, the Chiefs could find themselves in the hunt for the playoffs late in the season. The Chiefs haven’t missed the playoffs since 2014 but could be on their way if they continue to play poorly. 
The Chiefs have become one of the teams we, as fans, are conditioned to seeing in the postseason. Their flashy offense, featuring a plethora of trick plays and deep balls to speedy wide receiver Tyreek Hill, is part of what makes football great; it’s just fun to watch. With such a dynamic quarterback and experienced head coach, the Chiefs could turn things around before it’s too late. They just have to start somewhere, and losing 27-3 to the Titans this past Sunday isn’t the positive progression Chiefs fans wanted to see.

No. 20 women’s soccer drew with Washington Sunday afternoon in a 2-2 bout where the Trojans led twice before allowing the Huskies to level the score. Despite dropping points, USC remains undefeated in Pac-12 play and maintains its position at the top of the Pac-12 Following a 0-0 draw with Washington State Thursday, the Trojans arrived at the University of Washington to conclude their short visit to the Evergreen State with hopes of expanding their Pac-12 lead. 
USC opened the scoring in the 30th minute when freshman forward Simone Jackson raced across the left wing before cutting a pass into the feet of junior midfielder Croix Bethune who shot from just outside the box into the right post. The Huskies quickly responded a minute later when junior forward Kyla Ferry tapped in the equalizer following a series of ricochets. 
The Trojans continued the search for a pivotal goal in the second half until the 64th minute when Bethune completed her brace after receiving a pass from junior forward Hannah White in the penalty box. Once again, the Huskies responded in swift action three minutes later when senior forward McKenzie Weinert equalized after receiving a through pass into the penalty box and placing the ball in the top right corner. 
Both teams couldn’t settle the bout after two overtime periods and subsequently ended the game without a victor. The result marked USC’s second consecutive draw, both of which have been in away matches. 
Despite Bethune’s contributions with a goal in each half, the Trojans quickly conceded goals to Washington minutes after each instance and prevented USC from taking 3 points from the Huskies.  
“It was just tough conditions and … and we were a little uncomfortable in them today,” Head Coach Keidane McAlpine said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I thought, all in all, we did pretty well and we were just unfortunate not to score some of the ones on the other end.”
USC managed 20 shots with 7 on target, and Washington had 16 shots with 6 on target. 
“I thought we created enough chances to win the game,” McAlpine said. “I didn’t think we were as efficient in terms of putting shots on frame and forcing the keeper to make saves, and ultimately, it cost us the win.” 
The Trojans remain undefeated in the Pac-12 along with No. 23 UCLA. USC’s winning run lasted a historical 11 matches and spanned the course of nearly two months. 
“I think the team enjoys winning … What gives us a lot of confidence is that we were able to make sure we didn’t lose the game,” McAlpine said. “We were able to come away with a draw on the road in tough conditions at both places and that’s a part of being a team on the way to being pretty great.” 
Following UCLA’s draw with Washington State and Stanford’s victory against Arizona late Sunday evening, USC holds a narrow advantage at the top of the Pac-12 conference table. USC is currently at 20 points, while Stanford has 19 and UCLA has 17 points. 
USC returns to Soni McAlister Field to face UC Berkeley in its third-to-last match of the Pac-12 season Thursday at 3 p.m.

Warning: The following article contains spoilers from “Squid Game.” Viewer discretion advised. 
Netflix’s “Squid Game” broke the internet — literally. Within the first two weeks of its release, “Squid Game” was so popular that it strained South Korea’s internet infrastructure, creating a 24-fold data traffic jump and prompting service provider SK broadband to sue Netflix. “Squid Game” is now Netflix’s most viewed show, ranking No. 1 in 94 countries and becoming the first Korean TV show to reach No. 1 in the United States. 
A contemporary thriller embedded with a “Hunger Games” style dystopia, director and USC graduate Hwang Dong-hyuk’s “Squid Game” enraptured global audiences with its gruesome story — a desperate competition where the poorest of society kill each other through playing children’s games to win an insurmountable cash prize. Behind “Squid Game’s” unfiltered violence, however, exists a cautionary message on the undesired consequences of economic inequality.
During the midst of one of history’s worst global economic recessions, Hwang wrote the drama’s original script in 2009.
“I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life. But I wanted it to use the kind of characters we’ve all met in real life,” said Hwang in an interview with Variety.
Intense competition created by capitalism has become a pervasive 21st-century theme, and it’s especially relevant for South Korea. The country possesses one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with many of the cases attributed to economic insecurity.
According to an IndieWire interview with Hwang, Trump’s election  spurred “Squid Game’s” production: “I think he kind of resembles one of the VIPs in the Squid Game. It’s almost like he’s running a game show, not a country, like giving people horror. After all these issues happened, I thought it was about time that this show goes out into the world,” he said.
Social and economic insecurity, along with easy-to-follow children’s games, are the driving factors behind “Squid Game’s” universal appeal. Hwang even infused his own experiences into “Squid Game’s” story and characters.
“Just like Gi-hun, after the failure of my movie, I had a time when I wasn’t able to make any money and I was supported financially by my mother … Just like Sang-woo, I went to Seoul National University, the most prestigious university in Korea, and I was subject to a lot of big expectations from my family, and a lot of envy from those around me,” said Hwang in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.
These characters are one reason “Squid Game” appeals to such a broad audience. As college students, we experience intense pressures borne by job searches and academic expectations.
The virality of “Squid Game” led the internet to take it in very, very interesting directions. An article published in Evie Magazine argued that “Squid Game” actually critiqued the dangers of communism: “The Games are presented as a solution to the economic struggles of the contestants, similar to how communism is preached to those in financial distress.” All this despite Hwang’s public explanation that “Squid Game” comments on neoliberal capitalism’s effects.
South Korean labor union members even protested working conditions and raising South Korea’s minimum wage wearing “Squid Game’’ costumes. Thus, the show became a rallying point for workers in their battle against the established financial giants. 
Although some may argue that “Squid Game’s” virality is attributed to the idea that criticizing capitalism is the “new hot thing” in media, it is important to look past the bright pink and green costumes and face the reality of our situation. I believe “Squid Game” is Hwang’s warning of how morality tends to break down in the face of adversity. 
If you’re not lucky enough to be born wealthy or afford the growing price of college, life is in many ways determined by chance. It’s the unfortunate truth of our current economics — the wealthy are encouraged to find ways to exponentially grow and protect their earnings, while the poor have to work with worse quality education, credit scores and overall financial knowledge — all of which can drive individuals to act selfishly on both sides.
Despite our real world contradictions, I undoubtedly enjoy the use of cinema in bringing awareness to real world economic issues and encouraging the representation of Asian creators in the entertainment industry. Although an extremely bleak outlook of the real world, “Squid Game’s” unforgiving narrative depicts economic inequality’s gravity and its depressing struggles. In many ways, life itself can be compared to a rigged game — there are winners and losers, and the illusion of choice.

If you sit through the much-too-long Academy Awards, you are guaranteed to hear beautiful stars flash smiles and give rushed speeches that include the phrase: “I’d like to thank the Academy.” An ubiquitous Hollywood presence and Oscars buzzword, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences determines which movies deserve recognition and whom audiences should praise. Although it hosts the biggest event in Los Angeles, the Academy’s nonprofit status often flies under the radar, with people possessing a vague understanding of its purpose and structure. 
Formally known as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the Academy is a wealthy nonprofit with assets approaching $1 billion. Although widely recognized for hosting the Oscars, the Academy provides grants and holds other events and projects throughout the year. For example, with a $482 million price tag, the Academy recently opened the much-delayed Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.
The nonprofit operates under the mission “to recognize and uphold excellence in the motion picture arts and sciences, inspire imagination, and connect the world through the medium of motion pictures.” Despite this worthy cause, the Academy faces a similar problem as many other nonprofits — a lack of diversity. The Academy Awards showcases predominately white actors, directors and creatives while talented people of color fall by the wayside. 
Personally, I don’t see the need for the Academy Awards. My opinion aside, however, I understand why people working in the industry desire recognition. In any case, I don’t see the Oscars completely disappearing anytime soon. Therefore, if the Academy Awards is here to stay, it must at least face its racist history and undergo major change. 
For its 93 year existence, the Academy Awards has perpetuated racism. In 1940, Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in “Gone with The Wind,” a film which romanticized the Antebellum South and glossed over the horrors of slavery. Although McDaniel was the first Black person to win an Oscar, her victory did not represent a moment of racial equality. The Academy gave McDaniel the award at a segregated hotel and made her sit at a separate table from the rest of the all-white cast. 
The Academy fails to recognize talent of color, which is unsurprising when considering the nonprofit’s demographics. While the Academy does not publicly disclose its members, a 2013 survey by the Los Angeles Times revealed that 93% of members were white, 76% were men and 63 was the average age for voters. 
To become an Academy member, a person must either receive an Oscar nomination or get sponsored by two existing members. If members are mainly white, this process only exacerbates the problem of mostly white nominations. In other words, the nomination process for membership in the Academy creates a problematic cycle. 
After the Academy nominated all white people for the 20 acting categories in 2015, April Reign created #OscarsSoWhite to call for more diversity at the Oscars. Following #OscarsSoWhite, the Academy attempted to diversify its membership. In 2019, 32% of members were women and 16% of members were people of color as compared to 24% and 7%, respectively, back in 2013. Despite these slight improvements, these numbers are nowhere near acceptable levels. Unfortunately, nominations from before and after #OscarsSoWhite are still white and lack diversity. 
 In 2012, Octavia Spencer won the Oscar for Supporting Actress for her role of Minny Jackson in “The Help.” In 2019, after #OscarsSoWhite, “Green Book” won the Oscar for Best Picture. Movies such as “The Help” and “Green Book” follow a white savior narrative and applaud a white main character for the low bar of not being racist. 
White men directed both “The Help” and “Green Book.” These movies centered around racism are made by white people, for white people and ultimately judged by white people. The Academy Awards celebrates offensive racial tropes that attempt to check a diversity box and not make white audiences uncomfortable. 
This past week, long-reigning CEO of the Academy Dawn Hudson announced she would leave her position in 2023. A leadership change presents the perfect opportunity to catalyze substantial changes within the Academy. Until the nonprofit fully confronts its past and diversifies its membership, it will fall short of a better future. 
Although by no means a complete solution, the recent opening of Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is one of the first steps in the right direction — the museum directly mentions issues such as #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo. While the Academy Museum mentions past racism, it focuses primarily on a positive message of diversity. 
It is important to highlight the work of artists not previously celebrated by the Academy; however, the Academy cannot feign diversity from conception — it must address the flaws of its history rather than ignore them. In the end, the Museum’s messages of diversity fall flat if future actions do not reflect the Museum’s displayed values. Actions speak louder than words. Instead of hiding promises of diversity behind a $25 entrance fee, the Academy must take action so I can watch diverse winners on my television screen thank the Academy and actually mean it.
