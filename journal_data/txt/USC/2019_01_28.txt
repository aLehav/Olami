For many students, the transition from high school to college is the hallmark of adulthood. However, the excitement of being away from home, thrown into a new environment, also comes with the stress of adapting to more difficult classes and an independent lifestyle. In extreme situations, students may fall into depression or develop anxiety disorders if their stress is not mediated.
While on-campus mental health resources can provide students with support to manage their stress, additional care can come from an unlikely source — professors. This month, researchers from the University of California, Davis, presented findings pointing to positive results from increased faculty engagement. They developed the light-touch intervention system, in which a professor with a class of over 100 students sends individualized emails to students detailing their performance in the class, recommendations on how to improve their work and the professors’ availability for future meetings. 
Students who received such emails ended up earning higher grades on exams and performing better in the overall class. Even a quick, simple interaction between a professor and a student can make a noticeable difference in alleviating the academic stress that students experience.
At USC, freshmen often take classes in large, lecture hall-style classrooms, some of which have enrollment numbers in the hundreds. Among these large-scale classes at USC are general chemistry and organic chemistry courses, which are notorious for their difficulty and  high drop rates. For most students, this is a drastic change from smaller high school classrooms that cultivated necessary one-on-one interactions with their teachers. 
In many of USC’s larger classes, the only communication that students receive from the professors are mass notifications about exam updates. The only individualized emails are mid-semester alerts to students who are not on track to pass the class. This type of interaction, limited to high-pressure tests and low grades, cultivates a system in which students are only expecting to receive negative feedback from their professors.
In contrast, light-touch intervention ensures that emails are not only personalized to students’ needs, but also include uplifting notes of encouragement. In the UC Davis study on faculty engagement, professors praised students who got high marks on midterms, while they encouraged opportunities for growth and improvement for students who didn’t do as well. 
For students who normally decide to drop courses after scoring poorly on exams, light-touch intervention would help them feel that improvement is viable. By providing students with specific ways to do better on upcoming assignments and tests, these emails also foster growth-oriented mindsets, which are indicative of success in the classroom and beyond. 
With something as simple as light-touch intervention, professors could reverse the learning environment cultivated in their classrooms from one of negative to positive reinforcement.
While the idea of writing individualized emails might seem unfeasible, professors have the resources to do so. In classes with over 100 students, there are teachers assistants who can help draft or send emails. Professors can use templates that address similar concerns for students who are having the same struggles with the course. The Washington Post estimates that most professors teach nine to 15 hours a week — it is reasonable for them to take some time to email their students.
In addition to promoting improved academic outcomes, personalized contact initiated by professors communicates to students that they care. Numerous psychological studies show that community support is a major factor in easing the transition from high school to college. Community support can come from family, friends, peers and even professors. As seen in the UC Davis study, faculty engagement strengthens a student’s support network. 
In the light-touch intervention emails, professors also included a note on their availability to meet with students. Students perceived these teachers to be more approachable and caring, which encouraged them to seek help in office hours when they normally would not have. In response to these emails, students expressed gratitude for the advice and, more importantly, for the professors’ effort in engaging with the students. 
“I really appreciate what you’re doing and I do wish more professors do what you are doing,” one student in the study wrote in reply to their professor.
In a highly competitive environment like USC, academic stress runs rampant. To ameliorate mental health issues stemming from this, USC professors should look to adopt engagement techniques similar to light-touch intervention, especially in high volume, lower division classes. As the conversation surrounding University mental health resources continues, the spotlight should turn to the faculty side to see how they can do more to support students.

It’s 1942. A man lies in his bunker, fast asleep. His roommate watches him tremble. “He must be having a nightmare,” he thinks. “Maybe I should wake him up and save him from his misery.” 
But just before he shakes his roommate awake, he realizes that no matter how horrible the man’s nightmare must be, nothing can be worse than his reality. 
This is one of the most horrific stories I heard about those doomed to die in occupied Nazi territories when I visited historic concentration and labor camps in Poland over winter break. 
The Holocaust is a terrible moment in history we read about in school and watch in movies and documentaries. But going to the sites of terror themselves, seeing the blue gas stains in the gas chambers witnessing the true gates of hell is an entirely different experience. It brings the history to life. 
Sunday was International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This specific day was designated by the United Nations General Assembly because it is the anniversary of the Allies’ liberation of the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. As the name of the day implies, it is our duty to remember. 
But there’s a difference between remembering something and never forgetting it. It is much easier to remember the horrors of the Holocaust after hearing survivors tell their stories first hand. But as the number of Holocaust survivors dwindles year after year, remembrance becomes less possible. Holocaust deniers — and I’ve had a fair number of conversations with some — certainly don’t make matters any better. 
The duty to “remember” is a positive one. It implies a responsibility to bring back memories of the history, particularly on days like Holocaust Remembrance Day. But the directive to “never forget” is a more important duty. It means making sure the memories of the Holocaust live on in every context, every day — not just this past Sunday. 
It means we must never forget the capability of human beings to engage in incomprehensible hatred, to plan on obliterating an entire people — innocent men, women and children. It means never forgetting the horror despite how different life may look for Jews around the world today. History is a present-tense phenomenon. Today, our duty is not to remember the Holocaust when we cross paths with a spark that reminds us of it, but to make these sparks ourselves, so we will never forget it. 
On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, don’t just remember the suffering and the hatred. Never forget it. Never forget how a seemingly peaceful era turned indescribably horrific. Never forget how Poland went from heaven to hell for the Jews in just a few short years. Remember Auschwitz’s liberation. Remember how the world overcame Nazi hatred. But when it comes to what happened inside Auschwitz and the countless other death and labor camps, don’t just remember it today — never forget it any day. 
While Jewish persecution is sparser than it has ever been — maybe in all of history — it is no secret that antisemitism is visibly on the rise. With more Jewish cemeteries desecrated, Nazi graffiti sprayed around Jewish fraternities and Jews killed over their faith, we are far from living in a world free of antisemitism. 
Unfortunately, this is nothing new in Jewish history. Indeed, the famous Jewish joke is that all our holidays go something like this: “They tried to kill us, we survived, let’s eat!” Through all the struggles, the Jewish people have tended not to focus just on their victimhood, but rather on overcoming it. As legendary Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote, “Memory is sacred, but victimhood cannot be the foundation stone of Jewish identity.” 
The same is true with the Holocaust. The practice of Judaism deals with 613 God-given commandments. Philosopher Emil Fackenheim famously said that the 614th is to deny Hitler any posthumous victories. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember that commandment. But we must fulfill commandment 614 every other day, by choosing to never forget it.
