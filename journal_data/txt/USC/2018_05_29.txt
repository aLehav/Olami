The brisk pace with which allegations of misconduct, mismanagement and breaches of trust rose against the administration had a once-quiet summer campus in near-constant uproar. Students protested at Hahn Plaza; parents and alumni across formal networks and online groups demanded the dismissal of key administrators and the implementation of oversight and supervising bodies.

On May 25, C. L. Max Nikias agreed to resign as USC president — the first, though hopefully not the last major step toward the creation of a transparent, trustworthy university administration. As stated by the USC community and outside stakeholders, the more than 300 sexual misconduct allegations against former health center gynecologist George Tyndall has revealed much about the administrative culture of the school’s top brass. Namely, that the protection of the safety and civil rights of students fell second to the evasion of bad press, and the inconvenience of righting such an egregious wrong. 
However, it remains to be said that one key stakeholding group at the University — one with ties to the administration, one with much to lose, one whose visibility mattered — rose up in favor of student interests, on behalf of students and their safety. The 500 professors who signed a petition calling for the president’s resignation exemplified something greater, revealed something deeper: The extent to which this University’s faculty — who arguably have the greatest effect on students and their university experience — care deeply about the people they foster, mentor, and teach. 
The petition came from a variety of faculty perspectives across all disciplines — tenured or not, lecturer or emeritus, associate professor or department chair. There were names with a lot to lose; there were names who had seen 40 years of graduating classes and those who had seen less than four. In a scandal that revealed how dishearteningly little USC’s senior administration cared for our sanctity and safety, this petition was perhaps a glimmer of hope for parents and students alike. 
Those who know us best, who saw us most, who spend their lives facilitating and absorbing years of our growth, our joy and our struggles and our anger — those are the people who stood with us. At the faculty town hall, professors held up signs with the names of their female students. It was a reminder as deep as putting their names on that petition. Giving students presence in a meeting of stakeholders that was, at the end of the day, about student interests. 
So at the end of a painful barrage of revelation and scandal, at the end of a laundry list of cover-ups and hopefully the beginning of a new day, a new era, a new culture, something hopeful remains. The student experience has always been intertwined with our relationships to faculty; the most helpful and available mentor at any university has always been the professor who cares. What we learned in this harrowing time is that there are many of those at USC. 
The past couple of weeks also revealed that, moving forward, a commitment to student safety must be prioritized over the political interests of administrative organs. There was no excuse for the accusations against Tyndall to be ignored for so long, and even less for the administration’s failure to report him to the Medical Board of California once they were brought to light. But the representation of student interests in a vast and seemingly self-interested bureaucracy is impossible unless student representatives are allowed access and the student body is allowed transparency. 
Considering the administration’s years-long failure on those fronts, it demonstrates the magnitude of importance that should be attributed to the faculty’s willingness to exhaust time and energy making themselves heard, especially to an administration that refuses to hear us directly. 
It seems naught that anyone would contend that this did not have a meaningful impact on Nikias’ decision to resign. Though the administration’s actions were certainly egregious, and though one might argue such a petition would and should be expected, the message is still no less. All this goes to say is our professors went to bat for us; we need their support, and we deeply, deeply appreciate it.

Kylie Harrington | Daily Trojan
As I’m sure no reader of the Daily Trojan needs to be reminded, USC President C. L. Max Nikias agreed to resign from his position Friday. Though a resignation date has yet to be determined, a successor or interim president will hopefully soon be named. 
The induction of a new president will be an opportunity to reset the campus and administrative culture, maintaining the high points of Nikias’ leadership with a more transparent, student-focused and morally guided administration. Our new president will be tasked with repairing the University’s reputation and earning back the trust of students, staff, faculty and alumni, all while keeping the school functioning at the high level it is accustomed to. But, as the paper’s resident granola-eating hippie columnist, I hope this change of leadership and campus culture will lead to more  sustainability and environmental conservation efforts.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power lists USC as its largest institutional customer, creating a small city of its own within the Los Angeles power grid. Even the smallest changes made at our campus can affect the ecological footprint of the city, and that is very important in an area as densely populated and resource-starved as Southern California. USC only recognized this fact in 2008, when it opened the Office of Sustainability and began drafting a sustainability plan, but late is better than never in this case, and in the 10 years since, the school has made significant progress in shrinking the impact of our city within a city.
In 2015, the administration and both student government bodies announced the a multifaceted plan for significantly reducing the University’s environmental impact by 2020. The plan, cleverly named “Sustainability 2020,” includes practical goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving water, diverting waste and more. 
As of April 2018, we are projected to meet most of these goals, thanks to the generous support of USC’s senior leadership. For example, we are on track to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 20 percent from 2014 levels, thanks to steps like replacing fluorescent lights with LED bulbs, automating our HVAC systems and receiving LEED certification in all new buildings. Although these projects were expensive, they demonstrate the University’s commitment to environmental stewardship. This plan sets an example for large universities and institutions around the country, giving them a clear set of steps and clear evidence of those steps’ success.
But sustainability requires constant improvement, and even if our campus meets the goals of the 2020 plan by that year, there will still be much more to do. Sustainability 2020 took about four years to draft, and with two years until the deadline, campus leaders must start drafting new goals for 2025. Administrative processes like these are complicated and arduous (well, unless they involve ousting a president); in order to have a plan ready by 2020, we should start working on it now. In the short time that our school has committed to environmental conservation, it has done remarkably well. However, it would be a shame to fall into stagnation after 2020.
Some ideas for this new plan: We can continue to move toward zero waste by adding compost bins in the dining halls, and reduce carbon emissions through an increased emphasis on electric vehicles and the use of public transit in the University Park area. Additionally, we can give more grants to students studying environmental and ecological issues, especially those relating to Southern California. We can also purchase more sustainable and local foods, and start cutting ties with meat and dairy producers at factory farms. If we can stand it, we can even let our emerald lawns go yellow for a few months to save water. 
A change in leadership will be tumultuous and exciting, and I look forward to seeing a new president’s induction. But with all of the issues that this president must address, things can slip through the cracks. Based on all of the progress that USC has made around sustainability in the last 10 years, it would be incredibly disappointing to see this issue fall by the wayside.

Rating: 5/5
19-year-old Canadian and former Vine star Shawn Mendes has finally released his third studio album, Shawn Mendes. And it does not disappoint. The 14-track, self-titled album follows the commercial success of sophomore LP Illuminate, which has remained  on the Billboard 200 chart for 32 weeks since its release in 2016. 
Since launching his career in 2014, the young artist has set high stakes for himself. Shawn Mendes is a pivotal determinant of Mendes’ ability to successfully transition from teen pop sensation to career artist, as noted by Variety. On his third record,  the “Treat You Better” singer collaborated with a number of other artists — including Ed Sheeran and Khalid — to help bring his artistry to the next level.
Prior to its release, Mendes released five singles,  which were met with positive reactions. The radio hits stood out with their diverse style, compared to his previous singles. “Nervous” mixes his oft-utilized boy-in-love persona with a funky beat, which some say is reminiscent of Selena’ Gomez’s “Bad Liar.” On the other hand, “Lost in Japan” is a fun, upbeat — and addictive — track that features heavy pop sounds. 
“In My Blood,” the eponymous album’s lead single, is, however, the testament to Mendes’ growth as an artist since his debut Handwritten.  With a rock-heavy sound and lyrics like, “Sometimes I feel like giving up / But I just can’t / It isn’t in my blood,” Mendes opens up about his battles with anxiety and his ambivalence toward his transition from adolescence to adulthood. The range of talent was demonstrated within the first few tracks, drawing a picture of not just a boy with a guitar, but also of an artist ready to stake his claim on the music industry.

“Youth,” featuring R&B star Khalid, is another important point of maturity on the album. With sonic influences similar to those on Khalid’s American Teen, Mendes and Khalid sing about viewing tragedy through the lens of the younger generation, a crucial deviation from his other relationship-centric tracks.
Mendes sought John Mayer’s assistance on “Like To Be You,” a saccharine duet with Julia Michaels. The track pairs  simple acoustics with the dynamic between Mendes’ and Michaels’ voices to strike an emotional chord. “Where Were You in the Morning?” — which Mendes performed with Mayer live — draws inspiration from Mayer’s soft rock sound with a mellow beat and dreamy chords. 
Mendes, who  cited Justin Timberlake as a major influence in an interview with Billboard, uses a dramatic falsetto on “Why” and “Mutual.” With the lyrics, “You say, you want all of me today / But tomorrow’s not the same / My feelings never change / What do you want from me,” Mendes addresses the intricate emotional complexities of relationships, a marked departure from his former focus on surface-level infatuation.
On “Because I Had You,” Mendes collaborates with OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder to combine Tedder’s knack for lyricism with his traditional acoustics. And on “Particular Taste,” Tedder brings a new, rhythmic vibe previously unheard in Mendes’ older music.
Ed Sheeran, a master of romanticism and acoustics, assisted Mendes with writing “Fallin’ All in You,” a light and rhythmic song about the beauty of falling in love and the the emotional impact of having a significant other. “Queen” takes the same approach, except, alternatively, Mendes highlights how easily two people can go from enjoying a deep emotional connection to acting like strangers. 
The album closes with “Perfectly Wrong” and “When You’re Ready,” two tracks that remind listeners of the young Mendes they fell in love with in the first place. On an album filled with so many new sounds and complexities, Mendes’ decision to end with “When You’re Ready” demonstrates that Mendes will continue to remain true to himself while growing as an artist.
Ultimately, Shawn Mendes explores a variety of topics that he holds dear. While there may not be standouts like “Stitches,” “Treat You Better” or “Mercy,” the eponymous album relies on a more collectively consistent sound, which speaks to a serious artist capable of producing more than just a fleeting sensational hit.

Rating: 4/5 stars
It’s hardly difficult to review a Star Wars film — some of the highest-grossing and recognizably iconic works of the modern silver screen — and yet, there is astonishingly little to say about Solo: A Star Wars Story. Like its box office performance, both the story and the stars of the space opera’s last installment were, well, fine. 
Most of the buzz surrounding Solo before its release was overwhelmingly negative. Rumors derided not only the quality of the film, but also the credibility of the filmmakers — a debilitating blow for a work that then struggled to distance itself from the bad press. 
From the unceremonious replacement of Phil Lord and Chris Miller with one of Hollywood’s most reliable choices, Ron Howard, to rumors abounding that Lionsgate had shelled out for an acting coach for the young and relatively untested Alden Ehrenrich — the strapping Hail Caesar! kid who spends most of the film doing a sly impression of Harrison Ford — the buzz threatened the audience’s belief in not only the film’s potential success but the producers’ reliability. 
To trust in a reboot of a character as legendary as Han Solo is to trust implicitly that the filmmakers know what they’re doing. For Solo, impressions of the opposite were hard to escape.

But why did it stick? Other members of the franchise have overcome poor press before and gone on to become the highest grossing films of the year. One could argue that the series’ biggest gaffe was Attack of the Clones, and even that became the third-highest grossing film of 2002. Perhaps Hollywood might consider that there was a 10-year interim between 2015’s The Force Awakens and its most recent predecessor. By contrast, the last 30 months have packed in four Star Wars films, with a fifth to premiere next December. The novelty and wonder of a new Star Wars film is becoming humdrum — an annual expectation. 
Nevertheless, adding to the mediocrity of the film is the number of predicted boxes it attempts to check. The star-studded cast is updated with only the hottest and latest heavy-hitters — Westworld’s Thandie Newton, Game of Thrones’ Emilia Clarke, Avengers’ Paul Bettany, Donald Glover — and the always-reliable Woody Harrelson. 
Additionally, the film spends far too much time showing viewers the vistas and quintessential life-making moments that Star Wars buffs and fan-fiction authors alike have imagined a young Solo to have traversed. Partially a nod to the core base, partially a demonstration of “Look! We know this character! Look, it’s him!,” these scenes have a strange taste of hokum: Here’s Han Solo meeting Chewbacca! Here’s Han Solo meeting the Millennium Falcon! 
Many have laid the film’s lackluster box office performance (by comparison to its counterparts) at young Ehrenrich’s feet, which may or may not be justified. Perhaps it would be harsh to characterize his performance as underwhelming, but he fails to reinvent the character as his own or steal the screen with any rugged charm — but as far as the space opera’s youth portrayals go, he does still rank above Hayden Christensen’s Vader. Not a high bar.
In total, credit where credit is due: This was a Han Solo film. Whether audiences were hungry at all for a Solo film remains to be said; whether the script, director or actor chosen were all ideal remains to be said. But for a summer flick on a three-day weekend, Solo was a perfectly acceptable pastime.

When life gets boring, escape into someone else’s. No school and plenty of free time means that summer is the perfect opportunity to catch up on your reading bucket list. Here are some book recommendations to pick up at the beach, on a road trip or just in the comfort of your own home. 
Call Me by Your Name by André Animan
Photo courtesy of Atlantic Books.
Call Me By Your Name, originally published in 2007, became a household name when its film adaptation — starring Timotheé Chalamet and Armie Hammer — was nominated for Best Picture at the 90th Academy Awards. The novel is set in Italy during the 1980s, and spans 20 years as it follows 17-year-old Elio Perlman’s evolving relationship with a 24-year-old man named Oliver.
My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante
The first in a four-part series dubbed the Neapolitan novels and hailed by critics as the magnum opus of Ferrante’s career, My Brilliant Friend recounts the friendship between two young girls named Elena Greco and Raffaella “Lila” Cerullo. The story begins with their childhood, and later follows their lives as they try to find their place in their small town on the outskirts on Naples.
Barracoon: The Story of the Last “Black Cargo” by Zora Neale Hurston
In 1931, black author Zora Neale Hurston interviewed a man named Cudjo Lewis about his experience as one of the last living survivors who underwent the harrowing journey through the Middle Passage, commonly known as the Atlantic slave trade. After Hurston documented his account, however, she failed to find a publisher, and the story remained idle for 87 years until its publication in April. 
The Opposite of Loneliness by Marina Keegan 
Marina Keegan had just graduated from Yale University, and was set to begin an internship at The New Yorker, when a fatal car accident took her life. One of her professors gathered Keegan’s best works and published The Opposite of Loneliness, a collection of essays and short stories, to memorialize this literary talent who was taken too soon.
The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas
Angie Thomas’ debut landed at No. 1 on The New York Times young adult best-selling list. It follows a 16-year-old girl named Starr Carter who witnesses the shooting of her unarmed friend at the hands of police. Carter must figure out how to process the situation, especially as the case becomes a national headline and protesters take to the streets. A film adaptation of The Hate U Give is currently in the works, directed by George Tillman Jr. and starring actresses Amandla Stenberg and Issa Rae. 
Hellfire Club by Jake Tapper
For political junkies who also love fiction, this novel by CNN’s Jake Tapper will be right up your alley. Hellfire Club follows fictional Congressman Charlie Marder, who struggles to navigate the glamorous but dangerous post-war politics of Capitol Hill in the 1950s. 
Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet by Claire L. Evans
Claire Evans’ novel documents the sociohistorical accounts of a group of women known as the Broad Band, who helped create and shape the internet into what it is today. This group includes Grace Hopper, who democratized computing after World War II; Elizabeth “Jake” Feinler, who worked for Google and kept early versions of the internet online; and Stacy Horn, who, from her New York City apartment, ran one of the first social networks on a shoestring in the 1980s. These women, largely forgotten and erased from history, are now being put front and center and are finally receiving their long-due recognition.
Meaty & We Are Never Meeting in Real Life.: Essays by Samantha Irby
Comedian Samantha Irby began her career by blogging about herself on Myspace in 2009. Nearly 10 years later, FX has purchased television rights to both her 2013 memoir Meaty and her personal blog for potential adaptation. Last year, she released another set of humorist non-fiction essays titled We Are Never Meeting in Real Life, which became a New York Times nonfiction bestseller. Her ability to turn any of her life experiences into laugh-out-loud comedy has garnered critical acclaim and these collections are a must-read.

The USC track and field team spent Memorial Day weekend up north, competing in the NCAA West Regionals at Sacramento State. In the penultimate meet of the season, USC saw 20 of its athletes punch their tickets to the NCAA Championships, which take place in Eugene, Ore. next week.

A highlight for USC last weekend was a standout performance from freshman Twanisha “TeeTee” Terry. On Saturday, she helped her team of redshirt junior Dior Hall and seniors Kendall Ellis and Deanna Hill reach the NCAA Championships for 4x100m relay, with the group running a second-best time of 43.58. 
Terry was far from finished. In addition, she placed second at the regionals for 200 meters, clocking at 22.74 and marking a freshman record for the Trojans. Terry had previously qualified for the NCAA Championships for 100 meters on Friday, meaning she will compete in three events in Eugene. 
Unlike the women’s 4x100m relay team, the men’s group had a tough day in Sacramento. Sophomore T.J. Brock, junior Raj Benjamin, freshman Zach Shinnick and sophomore Michael Norman failed to qualify for the NCAAs. The team was unable to finish, dropping the baton early in its run. 
Despite the setback, USC looks to make a major impact at the NCAA Championships. Freshman Chanel Brissett, sophomore Anna Cockrell, sophomore Mecca McGlaston and Hall all qualified for 100m hurdles event, with Brissett finishing second at Regionals with a stellar time of 12.86. 
And while the 4x100m relay group fell short, members of the team still have the chance to shine next week. Brock will compete in 100m, after finishing seventh at regionals and recording a personal record of 10.19 seconds on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, Benjamin turned in a strong performance in the men’s 400m hurdles. He advanced to the NCAA Championships, after placing first with a school record time of 47.98. According to USC Athletics, his time is the second-best in the world. He looks to continue his impressive times with another standout performance in Eugene. 
Outside of track, redshirt senior shot putter Nick Ponzio finished eighth at regionals. He’s not a stranger to the big stage, as his throw earned him a fourth-consecutive ticket to the NCAA Championships. Ponzio looks to improve upon a sixth place finish last year.
On Thursday, junior Lyndsey Lopes earned a spot at the NCAA Championships for high jump, narrowly making the field with an 11th place finish in Sacramento. For senior long jumper Madisen Richards, there was much less doubt she would punch her ticket to Eugene, as she finished second  in qualifying. 
The NCAA Championships begin June 6 and last until June 9. USC will field athletes in 28 different events.

USC women’s rowing took 12th place at the NCAA Championships last weekend in Sarasota, Fla. After placing fourth in the Pac-12 Championships, they were an at-large selection for the championship competition, earning a 17th overall seed. Last year the Women of Troy placed 14th overall, and they used that momentum to exceed expectations at the 2018 NCAA Championship.
The 2018 USC women’s rowing team entered the NCAA Championship seeded 17th overall. Daily Trojan file photo.
After the first day of competition on Friday, the Varsity Eight (1V8) advanced to the I Eights A/B Semifinals. The Varsity Four (V4) and second Varsity Eight (2V8) made it to the C/D Semifinals. 
The Trojans scored a final tally of 67 points. The Varsity Eight finished second in the Petite Final, the Second Varsity Eight took third in the C final, and the Varsity Four finished fifth in their C final. 
The Women of Troy had a slow start to the Petite Final, but they grinded past both Michigan and Yale throughout the course. They competed closely with Virginia for the rest of the race, but Virginia edged out the Trojans by less than a second. USC ended with a time of 6:29.138 to Virginia’s 6:28.633, leaving the Trojans 1V8 eighth in the country.
The Second Varsity Eight competed as a top three team in their C final. They finished behind Wisconsin and Washington State with a time of 6:36.419 to secure the third place amongst six teams. The Varsity Four placed fifth in their respective C final with a time of 7:37.410. They finished behind Princeton, Navy, Wisconsin and Syracuse. 
Cal took first overall with 130 points, followed by Washington with 128 points. 
“The Trojan Rowing Family had a challenging set of semifinals and finals today that led to a 12th place team finish,” head coach Josh Adam said. “From start horn to finish beep, the women executed one of the grittiest races I’ve seen. It was great to see them beat several crews that had bested them earlier in the regatta.” 
USC junior Radka Novotnikova has maintained a vital role in the 1V8 boat, mainly from the bow, for the majority of the season. She led the Trojans in their battle against the UCLA Bruins, their inaugural showing at the Clemson Invitational and their dominant performances at the Pac-12 Challenge and Championship. She was also integral to the success of the 1V8 boat at the NCAA Championships this past weekend, just days before Novotnikova was named to the Pac-12 Women’s Rowing All-Conference Team. 
Also sitting in the 1V8 boat, senior Ida Gortz Jacobsen was named Pac-12 Women’s Rowing Scholar-Athlete of the Year in early May. 
Overall, the USC Women’s Rowing team had a strong season with a fierce finish in the NCAA Championship.
“Over the course of four 2000 meter races in two days, the Women of Troy showed great courage and tenacity,” Adam said.

Trojan Baseball closed out its 2018 regular season by dropping two out of three games to the Cal State Northridge Matadors at Dedeaux Field last weekend. 
Junior infielder Dillon Paulson totalled 10 home runs in his 2018 season. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
In Thursday’s series opener, the Trojans fell to the Matadors 1-2 in a 10-inning affair. Both teams scored in the second inning. The Trojans immediately responded to the Matadors’ score with a run from junior third baseman Brandon Perez off a groundout to tie the game. The 1-1 score would hold into extra innings.
In the 10th inning, CSUN redshirt junior outfielder Joey Cooper opened the inning with a single to right field. He would advance to second base on a sacrifice bunt and proceed to third on a groundout. A Trojan throwing error allowed Cooper to advance across the plate, granting the 2-1 lead to CSUN. Consequently, the Trojans were unable to match the Matadors score in the bottom of the 10th inning.
USC freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt threw 7.1 innings, to be relieved by fellow freshman pitcher John Beller. CSUN junior pitcher Walker Armstrong tossed the first 7.0 innings, and senior Hayden Shenefield pitched for the rest of the game.
USC looked to turn the series around on Friday night with a second chance against the Matadors. CSUN drew first blood in the first inning with a five-run performance that the Men of Troy could not match. Senior left fielder Albee Weiss hit a two-run home run that contributed to CSUN’s early dominating lead. 
Trojan junior starter Quentin Longrie was replaced by freshman Isaac Esqueda for 4 innings, followed by sophomore Chris Clarke who finished the game. USC tried to fight against its first inning deficit but only mustered one run in the second inning and two runs in the third inning. The Men of Troy ultimately fell 3-9 in game two. 
On Saturday, the Trojans took advantage of their third and final chance by defeating the Matadors 8-4 on senior day. 
The offense was headlined by junior center fielder Lars Nootbaar’s three-run homer and junior first baseman Dillon Paulson’s two home runs.
Redshirt sophomore Kaleb Murphy contributed to the win with a two-run single to knot the score in the fifth inning. Junior pitcher Solomon Bates dominated on the mound for 7.0 innings. Wegman threw the eighth inning, making his first appearance in about 11 weeks, followed by Beller, who tossed the final inning to close the win for Bates.
“It’s been huge going out on Sundays and being able to salvage series or even win series with [Bates],” Paulson said. “He’s given us his all the whole year and it was nothing different today.”
USC concluded its 2018 season with a 26-28 record. This marks the third straight season that the Trojan ball club has failed to achieve a winning record. However, the team’s young roster looks hopeful for the upcoming 2019 season.
“It was a great way to send [the seniors] off with a win,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after the game. “Our guys are learning how to win. It’s a young staff and that bodes well moving forward. The guys know they need to get a little bit stronger to withstand the whole season. I’m excited for the future of the program. Big things are coming.”

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
Last week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell enacted a policy to combat the seemingly endless debate regarding players protesting. The policy states that “all league and team personnel” who are on the field during the national anthem must stand. This ruling permits those that choose not to stand for the anthem to remain in the locker room. If a player or member of the organization violates this policy, they will be subject to “disciplinary actions” unilaterally by the commissioner. 
Regardless of your stance on players using their platform to spread their message or how much you hate or love Roger Goodell, most people can agree that the new rule is a cop out. It was Goodell’s way of trying to please both sides; however, this policy has pleased neither. Those that support the protests are angry that players can’t demonstrate in the public eye, while those who do not support the protests are upset because the absence of players who choose to stay in the locker room will be noted.
The NFL is a private business and should be run as one. It is permitted to limit the freedom of expression while players are at work. The ethical concern is a whole different debate, but for the sake of the point I am trying to make, there is nothing that limits Goodell from forcing players to stand for the anthem. Whatever and however they choose to protest in their free time is fair game, but when it comes to work, they must abide by the rules set forth by the NFL. It is similar to the dress code of a business. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to work there. It is getting old seeing the NFL try to implement new rules that attempt to please everyone and inevitably fail. Goodell needs to take a stance because this out of sight, out of mind approach will not cut it. 
Let’s say that Goodell doesn’t want to be portrayed as the “bad guy.” He could have enforced a policy that left the owners of each franchise to discipline their players accordingly. This would have placed the heat from pro-protest fans and players on individual teams. Admittedly, it’s a weaselly solution, but I have a feeling that owners like Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys would implement stricter, more absolute and ultimately better rules to govern their players. For example, last season Jones stated that his players will stand for the anthem; however, prior to the anthem in a game against the Arizona Cardinals last season, he knelt with his players. This is a happy medium that allows players to still protest in the public-eye while still respecting the flag and anthem. 
Perhaps the most obvious issue with this new rule is that it is not absolute. Front office members like Christopher Johnson, the CEO of the New York Jets, have already publicly stated that the organization will pay the fines that players incur due to the rule violation. This is just ridiculous. The fact that the entire policy can be bypassed by paying fines (and it’s not like the teams are tight on cash) is utter stupidity. If Goodell were looking for a real solution to this problem, he would have implemented a clause preventing athletes in violation of the policy from participating in that day’s matchup. This would force players, owners, managers and coaches to consider the potential loss of talent because of the violation. This would ultimately accomplish Goodell’s out of sight, out of mind policy to encourage players to protest via staying in the locker room rather than doing so on the field.
The lack of absolute rules in the NFL has led to so many problems. Who even knows what constitutes as a catch anymore? This issue is no different. What is so hard about enacting a rule that states something along the lines of: “Players of the NFL shall not protest while on-field” or “Players of the NFL are permitted to protest while they are on the field”? This new policy will probably make the “kneeling debate” even worse in the 2018 season then it was last year. Instead of a simple, absolute ruling, we are left with a spineless rule that fails to accomplish its one goal.

The Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program, the Keck School of Medicine of USC and USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center’s registry, has received a $43.7 million grant from the National Cancer Institute. 
Led by Dennis Deapen, the Keck School of Medicine’s Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program has been collecting data and information on different cases of cancer among county residents since 1970. Daily Trojan file photo.
According to the CSP director Dennis Deapen, this award is an important step for widening the door for diverse cancer research and tracking incidents of this illness within Los Angeles. 
“Without people like us collecting cancer data from a large, diverse population, cancer research primarily would be based on old, white men,” Deapen said in the press release. “That isn’t very useful for other ethnic and age groups because they have different genetic and environmental risk factors.”
NCI awarded the grant so that the program could continue to follow cases of cancer among Los Angeles County residents by tracking patterns and trends to enhance the prevention and understanding of them.
“We are the first line of defense,” Deapen said in the press release. “We identify cancer trends and pave roads that lead to better cancer prevention and treatment.”
Founded in 1970, CSP is the largest registry of the National Cancer Institute-funded Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program.
The population-based registry currently holds more than 1.7 million records of cancer cases and collects around 44,160 more each year. To this date, CSP has a bibliography of over 3,300 publications contributed to scientific journals. As one of the largest registries in the United States, CSP depends on NCI funding to track Los Angeles County’s diverse population, which consists of more than 10 million people. 
This grant follows the $1.5 billion that the National Institute of Health awarded the Keck School of Medicine and other nationwide organizations earlier this month. Both projects rely on Los Angeles County, one of the most  ethnically, medically and demographically  diverse counties in the United States, as a microcosm for international medical research. 
“The CSP is one of the most productive cancer registries in the world, in terms of scientific contributions toward understanding the demographic patterns and the etiology of specific cancers,” the CSP website stated. “The consortium of 18 population-based SEER registries provides the federal government with a ‘snapshot’ of cancer incidence and survival across the United States.”

USC professor Peter Kuhn speaks about his motivation for researching cancer solutions and his hope to reduce conflicts between the patient and physician over performance status. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Since its opening, the Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience has allowed USC professors and students to develop groundbreaking biomedical research.
The progress of their research was presented by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and Viterbi School of Engineering at a workshop on the “Wicked Problem of Cancer and the Art of Convergence” on May 23.
The event, which was held at  Michelson Hall, included a cocktail reception, a lecture by Dr. Peter Kuhn and a tour of the building. USC alumni and several members of the Board of Trustees attended the event.
Following the cocktail reception, Assistant Vice President of Alumni Relations Danielle Harvey Stinson addressed attendees. In her address, Stinson shed light on the research being conducted and performed at the Michelson Center.
“Imagine researchers using metal detection techniques, like the ones used by mining companies and airport security, to view tumor cells on a molecular level not seen before or taking a simple blood test to tell whether or not you may have cancer,” Stinson said. “These are just two of scores of research projects in the works here in the Michelson Hall.”
Stinson explained that the different approaches to research,  taken by the Michelson Center, ranging from the fields of medicine to engineering, will have a profound impact on healthcare and spur innovation in the future. 
“These scientists and engineers are coming together to fast track the development of new drug therapy, high tech diagnostics and biomedical devices,” Stinson said.
Once Stinson made her introduction, professor Peter Kuhn discussed how researching solutions to cancer would help make the future more transparent.
“We call this convergent science because we believe that cancer is indeed a wicked problem. . . a problem for which little amount of solutions currently exist,” Kuhn said. “The problem space is in fact not owned by a particular discipline. Because of this, the solution space is not yet well defined and it is certainly unclear.”
Kuhn began his address by thanking research sponsors as well as  USC faculty across the different schools whom worked with the Michelson Center. He went on to speak about his motivation for cancer research and the goals of his studies at the Michelson Center.
“Those of us not yet diagnosed with cancer will never really truly understand that upon diagnosis, the disease is with you for the rest of your life,” Kuhn said. “That simple fact is something that distinguishes cancer from breaking a leg. If you break a leg, you have this very simple, straightforward expectation that you will put a cast on it. The notion of curing cancer is not as simple.” 
Kuhn explained that there were three things to consider regarding patient care: patient health, patient forecasting and disease status. According to Kuhn, patients and physicians  often disagree over performance status. The Michelson Center, along with its partners, has developed a tool called ATOM-HP to reduce this conflict. 
“[ATOM-HP] will improve the interaction between the patient and the physician and it will improve the drug development process,” Kuhn said. 
Based on the results of clinical trials, Khun said that the tool allowed researchers to discover that patients with a low activity rate are at higher risk of unexpected healthcare events.
Kuhn also addressed the audience about characterizing cancer over time and metastasis, the spread of a pathogenic agent from one location of the body to another.
Presenting data obtained from breast cancer patients, Kuhn stated that there is an issue of space and time due to the different probabilities with which cancer can reach organs in the body. Using a familiar metaphor to explain the concept, Kuhn compared finding cancer cells to looking for a needle in a haystack.
Kuhn ended his lecture by providing a brief description and analysis of a treatment product for prostate cancer, developed in conjunction with Epic Science Inc., a company that develops medical diagnostics on tumor cells
“We have dozens of therapies available,” Kuhn said. “It is really critical that we get it right every single time, not just the first time but every single time, because every patient will benefit the most if we have choice after choice available for them throughout this journey through cancer.”
