Emily St. John Mandel’s newest novel, Station Eleven, follows a pack of musicians and actors through a post-apocalyptic world and into the town St. Deborah by the Water, where a cultish leader known only as “the prophet” reigns. The novel centers on this prophet, who creates suspense throughout the story, but the focus is beautifully split between both sides of what one character calls “a line drawn through his life.”
Before a flu epidemic decimated 98 percent of the global population, famed actor Arthur Leander had three marriages, one child and a fatal heart attack; his closest friend judged him for his adultery and condemned his boring job as a fixer-upper of corporate executives; his first wife became savvy, independent and emotionally hardened after their divorce. After, there is the prophet.
The book drifts between the random past and chronological present. As the story progresses, memories of the past unfold from wildly different perspectives, from those of 8-year-olds to married women to a paparazzo-turned-entertainment journalist.
The majority of the “after” chapters follows Kirsten Raymonde, who is 8 years old when the flu strikes. She was an actress as a child and founded the Traveling Symphony – a troupe that travels and performs Shakespeare plays and orchestral music — in adolescence. She carries few mementos of the pre-flu world, a world she can barely remember, which are less than Shakespearean: comics; celebrity gossip articles about a man she remembers perfectly; a beautiful paperweight. Kirsten is passionate about her items as they are the few precious belongings she has.
One night, as the Traveling Symphony bunkers down to rest, two of Kirsten’s dearest friends go back a few miles to ensure no one is following the Symphony, and never return. While searching for them, another member disappears without a sound — her partner turns away for a moment, and when he turns back, she’s gone. Then, as Kirsten and her partner retrieve water, the rest of the Symphony disappears without a trace. And all this after they discovered a stowaway: a child living in fear of the prophet, desperate to escape.
While Kirsten and her partner meander towards their last-hope destination, flashbacks ensue, prompting an analysis of how humanity was before the epidemic and how it is after. Consequently, the novel becomes a character study, exploring the subconscious of different people — those who never survived to see the flu, those who remember only the world after it, and those plagued with recollection of both.
This exploration of the characters allows the reader to conclude that after the flu, material posessions are not as important as personal relationships and how you deal with disaster. Even before the flu, it wasn’t the institutions or inventions that mattered but the people, how they used their instincts — how they reacted to both the everyday and the extraordinary.
That said, though the plot is intriguing, it can be hard to follow. Jumping around between years and months and worlds can get confusing, but ultimately, finishing the book feels rewarding. Mandel incorporates a pervasive sense of wonder into the novel, as if the narrative itself is struggling to keep history straight (much like the characters themselves strain to remember artifacts from the “before,” like the faces or voices of loved ones lost). Information that seems off-hand when initially read becomes vital later. Reality meshes with memory and fantasy to create questions: am I remembering earlier parts of the book right? Am I missing some connection? Am I forgetting something essential? How is everything intertwined?
The author is also successful in creating sympathetic characters and pulling emotions in different directions. Arthur’s first wife Miranda, for example, seems foreign at first, but she evolves to become (spoiler alert) a victim of the formerly devoted man’s promiscuous ways: a bit crazed, stubbornly strong and revitalized for her graphic novel project, also titled Station Eleven. Even if her reaction to dispute is disagreeable, she is more than sympathetic as she looks at herself in the mirror and says, “I repent nothing.” She is a victim of bad fortune, and though it may not feel like she deserves any of it, isn’t that how life tends to be?
Overall, Station Eleven is a interesting read. Don’t strain to remember everything or to make all the connections right away; the story will come together naturally as the plot develops. By diving into these characters’ psyches, Emily St. John Mandel weaves a beautiful piece of literature and a lovely read.

Thirty years ago, John Malpede founded the Los Angeles Poverty Department (LAPD), a theater troupe composed of homeless and previously homeless performers.  Fifty years ago, Akira Kurosawa directed Red Beard, a Japanese film highlighting a doctor’s relationship with impoverished patients.
On Jan. 15, USC students will have the opportunity to view a unique tribute to these two anniversaries through an excerpt of LAPD’s acclaimed performance, Red Beard/Red Beard.  The show blends the original 1965 film with a live performance from LAPD’s actors.
For the performance, the film is shown in Japanese without subtitles on a television on the center of the stage.  Meanwhile, actors perform on both sides of the television.
John Malpede, LAPD’s founder and current director, described how the performers work in tandem with the film being shown.
“Often [actors] enact scenes in counterpoint to the film and at other points they perform as a chorus, and use gestures to foreshadow, refer back to and otherwise amplify emotionally significant moments,” he said.
The event is just one part of a three-part series hosted by USC’s Visions and Voices.  The series also includes a screening of the entire film on Jan. 14 and a LAPD Performance workshop on Jan. 16.
“John Malpede is a remarkable artistic director, [he is] just an uncompromising, deep, and committed person,” commented Sasha Anawalt, one of the event’s organizers.
Red Beard is one of 16 films that Kurosawa created with actor Toshiro Mifune, who starred in Red Beard.  Kurosawa was a highly regarded Japanese filmmaker whose films feature existentialist and humanist themes.  He directed 30 films during his 57-year career, which spanned from the 1940s to the 1990s.
Red Beard takes place in 19th century Japan and centers on Dr. Yasumoto, the film’s protagonist.  Yasumoto begins his medical career with high hopes of working with an elite clientele.  However, to his dismay, he is sent to a rural medical clinic for his post-graduate training.  While there, he is mentored by Dr. Kyojo Niije, otherwise known as “Red Beard.”  As Yasumoto adjusts to his circumstances, the film tells the individual stories of the clinic’s patients, revealing dark cycles of pain.
Eventually, Yasumoto learns from his experience, gaining not only skill but also compassion.
Malpede first saw the movie in Oaxaca, Mexico shortly after Kurosawa’s death in the late 1990s.  He believed that the film’s themes would connect with a modern audience, leading to LAPD’s adoption of the film.
“The depth of the stories resonated as I knew it would in Los Angeles.  I was immediately convinced that the LAPD performers could penetrate and illuminate these stories,” Malpede said.
Though the film is 50 years old, it remains relevant through its portrayal of social injustice and poverty, issues that continue to prevail today.  Its performance depicts to audiences how these issues are still pertinent and the ways they affect victims.
Red Beard/Red Beard has gained international acclaim. In 2008, the Los Angeles Theater Department performed far from Los Angeles -— in Paris, France.  Because their venue, the Theater de Gennevillers, was fairly large, the production included four separate casts performing simultaneously for four audiences.  This unique set up earned the LAPD a nomination for the “Best Ensemble” award in Paris Theater.
After bringing Red Beard/Red Beard to Paris in 2008, the LAPD took a short break from the performance.  The Visions and Voices event represents the first Red Beard/Red Beard performance LAPD has staged for a few years.
“We are extremely lucky that USC is going to be the launching pad for this revival [of Red Beard/Red Beard],” Anawalt said.
LAPD boasts an impressive list of accolades, including the LA Weekly Theater Award, an Otto Award for political theater, the San Francisco Art Institute’s Kent Award and New York’s Bessie Creation Award.
LAPD is open to any Skid Row resident, and though many actors are veterans of the program, others are new to the stage.  For example, Kevin Michael Key, one of the actors who portrays Red Beard, also performed in the 2008 Paris production, while the other Red Beard actor, Tony Williams, just recently joined LAPD.
When LAPD was first founded in 1985, it was with these actors in mind; the primary purpose of the program is to motivate residents through the arts.  LAPD was both the first performance group and first fine arts program for the homeless in Los Angeles.
“LAPD has contributed … to creating a neighborhood with vibrant recovery, artistic and activist cultures,” Malpede said.
LAPD is a theater troupe with a mission — the underlying focus isn’t just acting, but activism.  With the upcoming three-part Red Beard series, students can experience LAPD’s uniquely artistic activism firsthand, through a 50 year old film which directly explores the poverty that the actors face themselves.
Reservations for Red Beard/Red Beard, the Red Beard film screening and the LAPD performance workshop can be made through the Visions and Voices website.

Jim Hodges’ exhibition, “Give More Than You Take,” on view at the Hammer Museum from Oct. 3 to Jan. 18 highlights themes of nature and negative space in the artist’s 25-year career. The exhibition spans an entire gallery and spills into the museum lobby. “Give More Than You Take” includes more than 75 pieces and was previously shown at the Dallas Museum of Art in Dallas, Texas, and at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Art should be considered in the context in which it is shown; thus, traveling exhibitions can be read differently depending on where they are placed, when they are shown and who sees them.
The exhibition includes a variety of installations, photographs, paintings and art created with repurposed materials. “Give More Than You Take” uses themes of nature, light and negative space to enchant and draw the viewer into a delicately crafted ecosystem. As the name suggests, Hodges’ work leaves the viewer with a curious sense of vacancy — the gallery becomes an abyss and seems reminiscent of a post-human environment. It suggests subtle touches of environmentalism and asks viewers to appreciate the beauty inherent in nature. This marriage of manmade materials and natural elements raises questions of human impact on the landscape and the impact of humanity on nature. Hodges’ work can be seen as the reverse of land art; it pulls themes of nature inside rather than taking the art outside.
Upon entering the gallery, viewers are greeted by “Untitled (Gate).” This installation acts as a passage into the exhibition and hints at the motifs of nature and vacancy. “Untitled (Gate)” is a spider web composed of steel, aluminum, copper and brass chains and charms hung in front of an empty cobalt blue entranceway. The delicate chains draw attention to the emptiness and depth of the entranceway. Deeper into the exhibition, viewers are confronted with a similarly sized entranceway partially blocked by menacing steel teeth inside the fragrant pine shed installation.
Hodges juxtaposes manmade materials with natural motifs, creating a connection between the organic and the artificial. For example, “Latin Rose” is a large-scale rose made of transparent tape and tarpaper. This piece floats eerily in the middle of the room — highlighting the rose’s transparency. Hodges’ use of transparent materials adds to the ephemerality of his exhibition and suggests the fleetingness of nature. “Ghost (2008)” features glass butterflies and leaves posed in a vitrine with a clear, glass flower in the center.  The nearly invisible center flower surprises the viewer and contrasts with the vivid butterflies also trapped in the glass jar.
Though his work is far from simple, it holds an unpretentious elegance. Hodges balances bold colors and striking materials with empty space, white walls and subtle reflections of light. This balance is suggestive of the equilibrium and tranquility found in nature. The artist installed intricately carved and altered mirrors in the corners and near the ceiling of the galleries to demonstrate the importance of light. This series of works, entitled “Moments,” casts reflections onto other works in the gallery and use natural light from skylights to highlight the organic nature of the exhibition. While it is tempting to read these mirrors as constructed “suns,” that interpretation devalues the mirrors as mere imitations of nature. “Moments” not only recalls sunlight but also reflects distorted images of the viewer and emphasizes the scale and open layout of the gallery room. These mirrors can also be viewed as site-specific; they are inherently bound with the gallery space and influence the viewer’s perception of the room.
While Hodges’ art holds an innocent appeal, the Hammer Museum places his work adjacent to the gift shop. Viewers cannot help but be bombarded with tote bags, prints, and various souvenirs as they cross through the gift shop to reach the galleries. The shop is a stark reminder of commodification. Though the Hammer Museum is free, the strategic placement of the gift shop speaks to the role money plays in art institutions. While it is tempting to disregard the role commerce plays in artistic creation, art and the economy are inextricably bound. Even if artists do not work for commission, the flow of capital influences what is sold where and who has access. No creative production is completely outside the realm of capitalism and economic influences.
In a different setting, Hodges’ work might seem overwhelming or repetitive — motifs such as leaves, flowers and butterflies infuse his pieces. Yet, the blankness of the Hammer Museum’s gallery allows viewers to experience his work without a sense of claustrophobia. “Give More Than You Take” even extends into the museum lobby. It is here that the viewer can find a small, perhaps overlooked, piece. “Untitled (Happy Valentine’s Day)” (1996) is a small framed ballpoint pen drawing. This melancholy and fragile looking rural scene is dwarfed by the colored silk installation on the adjacent wall.  Unlike Hodges’ other works, “Untitled (Happy Valentine’s Day)” is more traditional in the sense that it is hand-drawn and pastoral. It does not immediately seem to fit with the large-scale, colorful installations in the upstairs gallery and contrasts sharply with its surroundings. Yet, this drawing seems to sum up the vacancy and sense of nostalgia for nature the way a postcard idealizes the location it depicts. While a postcard is not a substitute for visiting the location, it presents a simplified view of what to expect there. “Untitled (Happy Valentine’s Day)” functions the same way — it hints at the themes of “Give More Than You Take” without revealing too much and invites the viewer to experience the exhibition for himself.
The artist will host a public lecture in the Graduate Fine Arts Building on USC’s University Park campus on Jan. 14 at noon.

Given the increase of corporate interference internationally,  landmark Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United give businesses unprecedented power in the bureaucracy. This is just one of the examples that the socioeconomic dynamics in America are  heavily skewed. The priorities of the common man have been supplanted by revenues — after all, priority is to the shareholders first, and then to the rest of society. Yet even in metropolitan Los Angeles districts, recent rezoning laws are being criticized as inherently biased against the city’s poor and disadvantaged, making it more difficult for minority representation. In a world heavily skewed in favor of those with money, this comes as no surprise but reveals flaws in the American economic structure.
With America’s capitalist structure, inequality is inherent. It, however, supports the growth of massive corporations, answering how frameworks of inequality have become frequent in this country. Such ventures desire greater profits, and the lobbying system in American politics allows these corporations to gain unequal representation in the legislatures. The lack of legal precedent for overturning such a practice has also led to its continued growth — the Founding Fathers certainly left no addendum in the United States Constitution concerning a corporate hijacking of the representative democracy.
As lobbying allows companies sweet-talk politicians for economic advantages, it is undeniably easy for the government to hastily draw new district boundaries. According to the Los Angeles Times, the infamous Operation Rezone, which netted the FBI and CIA prominent Fresno developer (and crooked racketeer) John Bonadelle in 1998, is just one landmark case of many in which entrepreneurs might use extra-legal means to take advantage of rezoning. This gerrymandering, which undoubtedly continues to this day, allows massive retailers and developers, especially those specializing in luxury goods, to redraw zoning lines to allow an influx of rich customers into political bounds where they have clout. In the businesses’ eyes, this is a win-win strategy: they make use of useful political lobbying infrastructure and gain massive profits, while benefitting shareholders and the districts’ constituents.
Yet while the corporate stogies and their indifferent consumers do their respective victory laps, they forget the other side of the story. They leave no sympathy or money for the indigent, who are often thrown into ghettoes or projects while their previous homes are bulldozed for utopian suburbia. With the Los Angeles Times reporting that more than 27 percent of all those in Los Angeles County lives under the poverty line according to a 2011 census, it is easy for entrepreneurs to justify moving their more expensive projects into neighborhoods such as South Central, where they claim that their strip malls and elite shopping centers will infuse prosperity. It’s no wonder that while so many city governments, like that of Los Angeles, claim credit for gentrifying “dangerous neighborhoods,” which only tell half the tale. They rearrange the neighborhoods, shoving the poor to the sidelines. After all, those in power find minorities easier to manipulate  than their other, wealthy  constituents — they have so much to gain and so little to lose.
In ignoring the poor, companies have perpetuated a cycle of poverty, nearly impossible for victims to escape. It is time for this horrific practice of economic disadvantage to end. There needs to be a stand against this discrimination, and not one that merely involves words. Too often have we have let social causes die with our passive advocacy, our hashtags and social media posts; these issues fizzle out as soon as the media loses interest. It’s not just the futures of current residents on the line — it’s that of future generations as well. We must advocate for immediate reforms in the L.A. redistricting legislation and allow the poor of this city greater representation, to have an audible voice in deciding where and how they live. Begin a petition. Verbalize the issue. Or perhaps even bring in the attention of the local media.
If these people are tossed aside, their lives bulldozed along with their homes, then this is no longer a land of the people, by the people, or for the people. Inequality is crushing the poor and driving them further away from the American Dream. Students, therefore, should not stand by and allow such corruption to affect fellow Angelenos.

On Monday, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney indicated his intention to enter the 2016 presidential election. According to the Washington Post, Romney has already begun to assemble a team for his campaign. He told a senior Republican that he “almost certainly will” make a third bid for presidency.
Rachel Atherly | Daily Trojan
In February 2007, Romney announced his first run for the presidency. Though optimistic, he lost his first primaries to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Sen. John McCain. A mere two months into his campaign, The New York Times began reporting that Romney was flip-flopping on his views and he ultimately lost the Republican nomination to McCain.
In 2011, Romney announced his second run for the presidency. He lost his first primary in Iowa to former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, but gained momentum and eventually won the Republican nomination. His campaign was marred once again, however, by accusations from the Washington Post of his mixed stances on political issues such as illegal immigration and foreign policy, and he ultimately lost the race to President Barack Obama.
Despite his repeated losses, Romney’s continued campaign runs are not considered abnormal or excessive in terms of America’s political structure. In fact, they are par for the course for politicians on Capitol Hill. In the House and Senate, the same handful of people have been running for office interminably, like Sen. Thad Cochran who, according to the Washington Post, has been in the Senate since 1978, and Rep. John Conyers, Jr. who, according to his biography on his congressional website, has been in office since 1965. But unlike Romney, these people keep running because the American people keep voting for them. Just last year, the Center for Responsive Politics reported that a staggering 88.5 percent of all incumbents who were up for reelection were voted back into office. This is the Congress that earned itself a scant 16 percent approval rating, according to polls by Gallup.
In this way, following American politics feels a lot like going insane. Every year the American people throw the same politicians at the same problems that seem to never seem to get resolved. Though our leaders pontificate about immigration reform and gay marriage and abortion and the economy, their talking points no longer appear to translate into action. They are merely repetitive arguments. But restating campaign promises on the House and Senate floors does not create new legislation — it does little more than provide quotable material for the next campaign. When members of Congress stand fast on their every claim and refuse to communicate with the other party, they are not providing what the American people need. What we need is legislation, which means compromise, amendment, and flexibility. This means ending political gridlock. This means looking out for the betterment of one’s constituents and one’s nation, not just the betterment of one’s career.
But voters need to act too. It is not entirely the fault of our representatives that they cannot represent their people when they refuse to represent themselves. In 2014, The New York Times reported a voter turnout of 36.4 percent — the lowest it has been in 72 years. Because of these numbers, congressional leaders do not know what Americans want. People let themselves be governed by the radical minorities that speak out when we they could be speaking louder. Maybe the incumbent members of Congress would not have an almost 90 percent re-election rate if we chose to show up and vote for somebody else. Innovative solutions to our nation’s problems could be formulated if time and money were spent supporting the lobbying groups that protect our interests. Additionally, if we had a radical referendum and voted for new politicians, new ideas, new solutions, the government would again be of the people, by the people and for the people, instead of being of the politicians, by the lobbyists, and for the special interest groups.
Hopefully, the political establishment will re-evaluate its policies if we deliver it a loss filled with the rage of 300 million dissatisfied constituents. Or maybe not.
Every year, fewer of us turn out to vote. Every year, we are disheartened. Then we lower our standards. Then we don’t vote. Then we are disheartened. And on and on and on.

Nestled quietly among small production studios and film equipment rental warehouses, sits the Elephant Stages — a building packed with three individual theaters just off Santa Monica Boulevard. The Elephant Stages has been home to some of the best of L.A.’s theater scene of the last decade or more.
Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be the case with Hellcab, written by Will Kern and directed by David Fofi.
Hellcab — set in Chicago over the course of one chilly day before Christmas — premiered first in 1992, and is touted as one of the “longest running shows in Chicago theater history.” It centers on one new-to-the-job cabbie (Danny Parker-Lopes) who picks up a dozen or so crazy, rambunctious and just plain odd passengers as they tool around mostly the south side of Chicago and often pay the meager fare of $2.70. The cab fare is notable for one main reason: it dates the play back to 1992, when you could pay so little for a cab ride and companies like Uber didn’t exist. But that isn’t the only dated sign.
The original run for the show was slated from Dec. 3 through Dec. 20, which makes sense. It is a holiday show, set around the holidays, featuring holiday music. To sit down as audience members and watch a story about a cabbie who discusses Christmas and family with his customers as “Silent Night” plays over the loudspeakers on a fairly warm day in January feels absolutely counterintuitive. A reason for why Elephant Stages thought to extend the show into 2015 does not come immediately to mind. But, more importantly, a reason why they even thought to mount the show in 2014 doesn’t either.
Though the play might seem topical in appearance, it proves it’s only surface level with its commentary —­­ especially in the hands of the closest thing they have to a narrator, Parker-Lopes, who handles most of the dialogue clumsily and off-tone. As the story attempts to navigate issues of race, family, sexuality, economics and eventually rape, Parker-Lopes does little to offer believability to both the narrative and his character. Lines are over-delivered, emphasized and dropped throughout. His delivery might be OK, if it weren’t for the rest of the cast (with a few exceptions) who also proved to be ultimately ill-equipped for the job at hand.
Furthermore, the topicality of the issues also seems fairly dated. In light of recent events dealing with both race and rape — most notably unrest in Ferguson and several college rape scandals in just the last year alone — the commentary provided in the play appears shallow, half-hearted and fairly uneducated. Especially considering that many of the story’s vignettes are played for comedy, the show doesn’t quite seem to know what it wants to be, nor does it convey what it wants from the audience: should we laugh or cry? Or laugh because we’re supposed to cry because the moment is so ludicrous?
However, that isn’t to say every moment was painful. There were several vignettes that were both purposefully funny and actually funny, causing laugh-out-loud moments for the audience (who filled about a quarter of the seats in the theater, which again, begs the question: why was this play’s run extended?). At one point, an expecting couple file into a cab as the woman (LeShay Tomlinson Boyce) screams desperately in labor. The father-to-be (Erick Nathan) explains their situation and introduces himself to the cabbie, by saying: “I’m not a parole officer, I’m a social worker,” to which the woman interjects, “This ain’t career day!” This joke caused an uproar of laughter from the audience. In fact, the whole vignette sparkled with energy (thanks in part to the writing, but also to the actors) that was seriously lacking from most of a show that was riddled with slow pauses between set changes and lackluster delivery.
Other notables include Lawrence Dillard’s cross-dressing gossip, who enters the cab by spraying breath freshener in his mouth, then in the air, and then whips his head around into the sprayed cloud and begins his monologue by yelling, “Well what had happened was…” with all the well-timed comedic sass and flare needed for the role.
Other notables include Scott Krinsky (most well-known for a supporting role on NBC’s action/romance series Chuck) who plays a wild-eyed and desperate new-wave radicalist who proclaims, “This country is lost! What do we need to get back on track? Space exploration!” There’s also a very nice scene between two sisters (Kimberly Alexander and Shannon McManus) as they deliver funny but believable lines like, “Can you believe what Mom did?” and, “You wonder why I don’t let you around my children.”
However, at one point a group of loud out-of-towners climb into the cab and proclaim, “You know why they call Chicago the Windy City? Because it blows!” which ultimately raises the notion, maybe this version of Chicago blows.

The Trojans capped off 2014 on a high note with a 45-42 victory over Nebraska in the National University Holiday Bowl, which catapulted the program into a busy offseason for former, current and future players.
Trojans to the NFL 
Just two days after USC celebrated its bowl win in San Diego, junior defensive end Leonard Williams shut down any further speculation about his post-college endeavors by announcing that he would forgo his final year of eligibility and enter the 2015 NFL Draft.
The 6-foot-5, 300-pound Williams, who is a two-time All-American, is projected to be a top-10 pick in the draft.
Less than a week later, junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor joined Williams by announcing his intentions to enter the draft.
Redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen’s most recent announcement completed a trio of the three USC underclassman to declare for the draft.
The Trojans will also be losing a band of accomplished seniors with NFL aspirations including tight end Randall Telfer, cornerback Josh Shaw, safety Gerald Bowman and linebackers Hayes Pullard and J.R. Tavai.
Tavai and Telfer will be participating in the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl this Saturday at the StubHub Center in Carson, California.
Offensive Line Coaching Vacancy
The program also lost offensive line coach Tim Drevno, who will join former San Francisco 49ers and Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh as his offensive coordinator at the University of Michigan.
Drevno served as both USC’s offensive line coach and running game coordinator in 2014, and the Trojans ranked 68th in the nation in rushing offense under his direction.
“I am happy for Coach Drev and wish him luck with his new job because he deserves it,” said offensive lineman Zach Banner, who will be a redshirt junior next season, via Twitter.
According to early reports, Mississippi State offensive line coach and co-offensive coordinator John Hevesy, who spent six years with the Bulldogs, is expected to replace Drevno.
Recruiting Strides 
The news of Drevno’s departure hasn’t slowed down head coach Steve Sarkisian and his staff’s momentum on the recruiting trail. Since the coming of the new year, USC’s 2015 recruiting class has moved up the No. 3 ranked class, according to Rivals.com.
The program currently has 21 total commitments in its first full season back with the maximum amount of scholarships at 25. Sixteen of those commitments are verbal.
Five players comprising the 2015 class have already signed financial-aid agreements and have enrolled for the spring 2015 semester.
This group of players includes highly touted quarterback Ricky Town of St. Bonaventure High School, receiver Isaac Whitney, linebacker Cameron Smith and offensive linemen Chuma Edoga and Roy Hemsley.
As of now, Sarkisian has the ability to sign 19 more recruits as National Signing Day quickly approaches on Feb. 4.
“Our future — and I’ll say it again — is ridiculously bright,” Sarkisian said in an interview with ESPN following his team’s Holiday Bowl win.
With 5 players enrolling in Spring, those recruits apply to the 2014 Team?  So wouldn’t that allow us to go 25 signees for 2015 for a total of 30?
We wont be tops until at least 2016 as long as we keep the good recruiting classes going. We have lots of returning starters but I’d caution from ranking us so high in the “Way too early” rankings. I’d put us at 11-16. Let the play during the season set our rankings and hope we win the PAC-12 South!

While most Trojans were enjoying their final week off before the start of the spring semester, members of the USC men’s tennis team were busy competing in the Southern California USTA Pro Futures event taking place at Marks Stadium on the USC campus.  The ITF Men’s Circuit event, which took place from January 5 to January 11, featured both singles and doubles action.  It was the first tournament USC’s men’s tennis team had competed in since the Jack Kramer Intercollegiate Tournament in November.
Despite the advantage of playing on their home court, the USC men’s tennis squad had a rough tournament full of early round losses.  In singles play, senior Yannick Hanfmann fell to Mackenzie McDonald in round one 7-6(4), 6-2.  Senior Jonny Wang didn’t fare well either, losing his first round matchup against Adrien Puget 6-1, 6-2.  Senior Roberto Quiroz was unable to make it to the second round, losing to Frederik Nielsen, who was ranked #4 in the tournament, by a score of 6-2, 7-5.
Even former USC men’s tennis star Daniel Nguyen, who was ranked #2 in the tournament, was unable to escape the first round.  Nguyen dominated the opening set against his first round opponent Nathan Ponwith with a score of 6-0.  However, Ponwith out-dueled Nguyen in the second set and won 6-4.  Ponwith carried his momentum into the third and final set, winning it with a commanding score of 6-0 and knocking Nguyen out of contention in the singles tournament.
Senior Eric Johnson was the only Trojan who made it past the first round.  In round one, Johnson had a hard fought battle with Tom Fawcett, but won in two close sets by a score of 6-4, 7-5.  However, Johnson would not make it any further as he was taken down in two sets by Ponwith, who still had momentum from his underdog victory over Nguyen in round one, in round two by a score of 7-5, 6-0.
Doubles action didn’t have much more success than singles action for the USC men’s tennis team, which added to the disappointment for the nation’s number one college men’s tennis team.  Hanfmann and Quiroz took down fellow Trojans pair Nick Crystal and Thibault Forget in round one 6-4, 6-0.  However, Hanfmann and Quiroz were eliminated from doubles competition in the quarterfinals, losing to the tournament’s #1 ranked pairing of James Cluskey and Frederik Nielsen 7-6(2), 6-3.  Nguyen also teamed up with past Michigan University tennis star Jason Jung, but the pair was taken down in the first round by Mackenzie McDonald and Martin Redlicki by a score of 6-3, 6-1.
At practice following the tournament, USC men’s tennis coach Peter Smith didn’t sugarcoat his thoughts about his team’s performance during the tournament.  “We sucked,” said Smith.  “It was not only disappointing to me, it was disappointing to the guys.”
Smith believes the winter break and footwork were the main reasons why his team played poorly.
“The guys didn’t come back from vacation in shape,” said Smith.  “They weren’t                       match-tough.  They weren’t ready to play.  I would say only two of the guys were really ready to play … We weren’t in shape enough to work our feet hard enough.”
However, Smith also believes that the timing couldn’t be better if his team had to suffer a major loss.
“It’s good to get that out of the way,” Smith said.  “A nice little wakeup call.  I think the day we lost five matches, three singles [and] two doubles, the ranking came out [and] we were number one in the country.  So, that’s good that we’re getting that message across that you can’t BS around and expect to still be competitive.”
For the immediate future, Smith’s plan to get the team back to its winning ways is simple.  “We just need to get together as a team and start working out and practicing,” Smith said.

Unlike the 2013 season, which was met with anticipation as it saw Lane Kiffin in the hot seat, the 2014 season held candid uncertainty.
Before the 2013 season even began, fans were calling for Kiffin’s job. A universal dislike of Kiffin brought the ’SC faithful together more than a shared love for the team.
The 62-41 loss to Arizona State that resulted in Kiffin’s legendary 3 a.m. dismissal at LAX, what should have been a low point of the season, seemed to be a turning point for the Trojans. Defensive line coach Ed Orgeron took over as interim head coach, and though his record wasn’t perfect, he led the Trojans to an exciting fourth quarter upset over Stanford.
The excitement of the Stanford game and Orgeron’s losses, both to competitive opponents UCLA and Notre Dame, had many Trojan fans believing that he would be named head coach. So when Pat Haden opted for Steve Sarkisian over Orgeron, many fans were skeptical.
When the 2014 season began, no one knew what to expect of Sark. People liked him more than Kiffin, but weren’t sure if he deserved the job over Coach O. Since becoming a head coach at Washington in 2009, Sark had never won more than nine games in a season. And as the skeptics will remind you, Sark won nine games with the Trojans in 2014.
Since the win over Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 27, the Trojans have lost junior defensive end Leonard Williams, junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor and “redshirt” junior tailback Javorius ‘Buck’ Allen to the NFL.
While 2014 had its fair share of struggles and disappointments, the majority occurring in the fourth quarter, the season also highlighted a lot of potential in USC’s underclassmen, who will be ready to lead the Trojans in 2015.
Freshman Adoree’ Jackson, a dual threat at wide receiver and cornerback, put the exclamation mark on his impressive freshman season with his performance in the Holiday Bowl. Jackson had a 98-yard kickoff return and 71-yard catch and run for a touchdown. After the game, Sarkisian said that Jackson’s play was reminiscent of Reggie Bush.
Another freshman phenom that holds a lot of potential for the Trojans is wide receiver JuJu Smith. Smith had 724 yards and five touchdowns on 54 receptions this season as the number-two receiver behind Agholor. Now that Agholor has left for the NFL, Smith is poised to return as a leader next year.
Though USC loses key defensive weapons in Leonard Williams and senior outside linebacker J.R. Tavai, sophomore safety/linebacker Su’a Cravens showed impressive duality in only his second season at USC. Cravens earned All-Pac-12 first-team recognition after the 2014 season, during which he had 68 tackles, 17 tackles for loss, five sacks and three interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. These returners will be joined by USC’s highly ranked 2015 recruiting class.
USC’s four-year probation ended on June 10, and the Holiday Bowl marked the last time that USC will play with a restricted scholarship count due to the NCAA sanctions. The Trojans will have their first full recruiting class since 2011.
Sark currently has 21 total commitments out of the maximum 25, 16 of which are verbal. Five players have already signed financial aid agreements and have enrolled for this spring semester. Some of USC’s top 2015 recruits are four-star quarterback Ricky Town, who had previously committed to Alabama; wide receiver Issac Whitney; linebacker Cameron Smith and offensive linemen Chuma Edoga and Roy Hemsley. Sark can sign 19 more recruits on National Signing Day on Feb. 4.
These new additions to the team, along with the already present young talent should help Sark compose a winning team in the early post-sanction years.
As for 2015, it is likely only the begin
ning, but the return of quarterback Cody Kessler for his senior season should help Sark break the seasonal nine-win barrier he has struggled to overcome since 2009.

Despite a spirited comeback, the USC Trojans men’s basketball team fell to the Stanford Cardinal 78-76 on Sunday night. The team’s record falls to 9-6 overall and 1-3 in conference.
The Trojans trailed by as many as 13 points before pulling within one point with just seconds to go, but ultimately came up short.
USC entered the game fresh off their first Pac-12 conference win of the season over the Cal Golden Bears. Freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin returned after a two-game absence due to a shoulder injury.
Though they made four of their first five shots, the Trojans fell behind early to the Cardinal. Stanford, led by Pac-12 No. 2 scoring leader guard Chasson Randle, shot the lights out in the first half.
The Stanford bench and outside shooting carried the Cardinal through the half. Junior forward Rosco Allen came off the bench to contribute 12 first-half points, including 3-3 from     three-point range. Stanford shot 9-13 from behind the arc as a team and cruised to a comfortable    49-43 halftime lead.
The Trojans were able to stay in the game by capitalizing on turnovers and converting at the free-throw line. As a team, they shot 12-14 from the charity stripe and forced the Cardinal to turn the ball over seven times in the first half.
USC came out of halftime looking to take the lead, but turnovers cost the team dearly. The Trojans turned the ball over nine times in the second half and quickly found themselves down by double digits.
Stanford led by as much as 13 points before going cold for the last five-plus minutes of the second half. Freshman guard Elijah Stewart and sophomore guard Julian Jacobs sparked a Trojan run by scoring nine straight points. After a handful of missed Stanford threes, McLaughlin grabbed the rebound and took the ball coast to coast and converted the layup, bringing the Trojans within one at 77-76 with 40 seconds left in the game. The Trojan defense came up huge once again and gave the team a chance to win with 7.6 seconds left.
Just when it seemed the Trojans could take the lead, McLaughlin turned the ball over when driving to the paint. One free throw from center Stefan Nastic sealed the victory for the Cardinal.
“We wanted to penetrate and see if we could score, make one or two passes. Look, you can’t fault him. He played his first game back from a serious shoulder separation,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He comes out and just plays so hard and I’m very, very proud of him. What can you say. He gave it his best chance and he just tripped.”
The Trojan defense stepped up their game in the second half as they held Stanford to just one made three-pointer and 35 percent shooting from the field. The team also forced Stanford into 14 turnovers and outscored the Cardinal 42-32 in the paint. The Trojans also did not allow a field goal for the final 5:27 of the game.
“We have potential, I think you see that,” Enfield said. “For them to rally and get stops on the defensive end. We were down double digits and for us to come back, that’s a very positive sign that we didn’t give up.”
The Trojans face crosstown rival UCLA on Wednesday night at the Galen Center. Tip-off is set for 6 p.m.

After a month of home games, the USC women’s basketball team traveled to Colorado and Utah to gain two more Pac-12 wins. The teams’ record improved to 11-5 overall and 3-2 in conference.
The Women of Troy did not lose the lead in either game. Their opponents, however, found ways to close the point deficits forcing the team to address and correct their game plan.
“Road wins are always big,” said coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “Going to someone’s home court in a difficult game, when you’re not at your best [and] you still come out with a win, it makes it a bigger victory.”
On Friday night, USC stormed through Colorado with an 81-61 victory. Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert and senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama shot the lights out of Coors Events Center by scoring 20 points each. Sophomore guard Brianna Barrett also contributed a generous 17 points and went on to be the only Trojan to score double digits at both games.
USC wrangled in the Buffaloes during the first half. Though USC was shooting at 43 percent and Colorado at 42 percent, turnovers and a pair of three-point shots were the catalysts to success for the Trojans.
Defensive stops and reliable offense gave the team the early lead within the first five minutes of the game. They then held the Buffs to over two scoreless minutes, giving the Trojans an opportunity to extend their lead.
Freshman guard Courtney Jaco was the first to shoot from behind the arc. Less than four minutes later, sophomore guard Brianna Barrett dropped another three-pointer and the Women of Troy soared beyond the Buffs with a 40-27 lead by the end of the half.
“We had intensity and the energy coming out of the game,” Vaioletama said. “There was a couple of times where we were on the run and got to the free-throw line.”
In the second half, the Buffs returned with an offensive stampede and scored 20 points within the first eight minutes, while the Women of Troy added just 16 points.
“We had to pick up our defense,” Barrett said. “We had a mini slow start but we picked up again with our energy.”
USC frequented the free-throw line as the second half continued. Barrett made 10 out of 13 free throws, leading the Women of Troy to a crushing win over Colorado.
Continuing the road trip, USC won a 46-43 game against Utah this past Sunday. The Women of Troy were unable to land a single three-point shot. However, free throws saved the team in the end as they scored 12 out of 16 points at the key. Barrett had the highest score for USC in the game with 13 points. Utah forward Taryn Wicijowski and guard Paige Crozon scored 14 points each.
Both teams scored at a sluggish pace with USC shooting at 36.7 percent and Utah trailing in field goals at 31.8 percent. Halfway through the first quarter, the game was tied at 11 points. After a three-point play by junior forward Kaneisha Horn and a score from Barrett, the Trojans had a five-point lead. Sophomore guard Jordan Adams seized a bucket and sparked an argument from the Utah sideline that resulted in a technical foul for the Utes and with that, USC was up 26-17 at halftime.
The Trojan experienced a rough second half when after scoring early, the team went scoreless for six minutes. Freshman forward Kristen Simon ended the drought with 9:30 left in regulation, but the Utes kept the game close.
Cooper-Dyke said the Utes were very physical, making the game tough for the Trojans.
“Utah did a very good job with getting us out of our game plan,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We had to call a lot of different offensive sets and a lot of different plays to stimulate some offense.”
After securing a five-point lead, the Women of Troy then suffered another offensive drought and the Utes took advantage of the opportunity. With only 14.5 seconds left, Utah was down by 1. After Simon sealed the game with two free throws, Utah was not able to fill the gap and fell to the Trojans 46-43.
As the result of a successful road trip, Calvert was named  Pac-12 Freshman of the Week on Jan. 5.
“It all came from my team and feeding off of them,” she said. “It was a blessing.”
Looking forward, USC welcomes freshman transfer Sadie Edwards from UConn. Edwards played six games with the Huskies averaging 4.8 minutes per game. In high school, she was named Newark Star Ledger Prep Player of the Year.
“She was a big part of two high school state championships,” Cooper-Dyke said. “She’ll be practicing and training with us immediately, and we can’t wait to have her.”

The 27th Annual USC Libraries Scripter Award ceremony will be held on Jan. 31 at the Los Angeles Times Reference Room of Doheny Memorial Library.
The ceremony — a black-tie gala attended by some of the film industry’s biggest names — will honor English-language films “based on or inspired by a single book or book series, novella, short story, graphic novel, play, magazine article, or characters originating from such printed works” according to the Scripter Award criteria. The Scripter Award is given to the screenwriters of the winning films as well as the authors of the works that inspired them.
This year’s five finalists include authors and screenwriters of several 2014 blockbuster hits. Creators of Gone Girl, Inherent Vice, The Theory of Everything, Wild and The Imitation Game are competing for this year’s award.
“I especially like films when I’ve read the books,” said Kameni Ngahdeu, a senior majoring in human biology. “I saw Gone Girl and liked the story so much I could’ve read the book.”
Gone Girl author and screenwriter Gillian Flynn, along with the other candidates, were chosen by a 55-member committee. Committee members include “Writers Guild of America members, Academy Award-winning and Award-nominated screenwriters, authors, film industry executives, faculty and selected members of the board of the Friends of the USC Libraries,” according to the 2015 Scripter Award Eligibility and Selection Rules.
The current committee chair, Howard Rodman, is a USC professor, vice-president of the Writers Guild of America, West and an artistic director of the Sundance Institute Screenwriting Labs.
The Scripter Award was founded in 1988 by actress Marjorie Lord Volk, real estate developer Glenn Sonnenberg and former Dean of USC Libraries Charles Ritcheson. Some of the award’s past winners include Schindler’s List (1994), The English Patient (1997), The Hours (2003) and No Country For Old Men (2008). 12 Years a Slave (2014) took the award last year.
The event annually gathers some of the most prominent figures in the film and publishing industries, as well as important figures in academia.
Tickets for the ceremony has seven sponsorship levels. Guests have the option of purchasing anything from a single ticket for $500 to a $30,000 ticket package for a table.
The event’s proceeds go to specific projects, such as the renovation of the Leavey and Doheny libraries in the past. This year’s proceeds will go to the Cinema Library.

The USC Gould School of Law has appointed Andrew T. Guzman as the new dean of law, effective July 1, 2015.
According to USC News, Interim Provost Michael Quick announced Guzman’s appointment on behalf of USC President C.L. Max Nikias last Tuesday. Guzman, a specialist in the study of international law, currently administers at the University of California, Berkeley as the associate dean for international and executive education, and as the Jackson H. Ralston Professor of Law.
Guzman will take the place of current Gould Dean, Robert Rasmussen, who has administered the law school since 2007. Additionally, Guzman will assume the title of Carl Mason Franklin Dean’s Chair in Law.
“There’s no better person with education to lead the Gould School of Law forward than Andrew Guzman,” Rasmussen said. “Andrew is the leading international law scholar of his generation, he’s a gifted teacher and an incredibly able administrator. He has the experience and the vision to ensure that our school will remain at the forefront of legal education.”
Rasmussen resigned from his position last May. In the past year, the school has slipped in the national rankings, falling from the 18th spot to the 20th in the U.S. News & World Report.
The USC Gould School of Law, however, continues to receive various accolades for competitive legal education. Forbes listed USC Gould graduates as having the sixth-highest mid-career salaries among law graduates and in 2014, graduates from Gould had an 87 percent passing rate for the bar exam.
Rasmussen noted various innovative programs within the Gould School that have attributed to the continued growth among students and faculty.
“We are happy with the innovative programs that we’ve put in place. [For example] Our business law program, our entertainment law program and our program in alternative dispute resolution,” Rasmussen said. “We’re very proud of the scholars we’ve been able to attract and retain to the Gould School of Law. We are very comforted by the continued success of our graduates in an ever-changing legal profession.”
In February of last year, the USC Gould School of Law, with the combined efforts of Dean Rasmussen and President C.L. Max Nikias, raised more than $150 million to further accelerate the school’s stance as a leader in law education.
USC Gould School of Law is hailed by law scholars as a unique, unparalleled environment with distinctive programs such as the 3+3 initiative, which allows a select group of undergraduate students to complete their bachelor and law degrees within six years. The school also gains traffic from global scholars who are able to complete their Master of  Laws online.
Rasmussen explained what he foresees for the Gould School of Law under the administration of Dean Guzman.
“I think 10 years from now, we’ll look back and say it was one of the best decades in the history of the Gould School of Law,” Rasmussen said. “I think the combination of various parts of [the] law school and Andrew’s talents, ability and vision are really the recipe for success going forward.”
@Suicidal_JD, you need to expound. You should tell prospective law school students that becoming a lawyer is akin to “making it big in Hollywood.” Very few people make big money, and lots of people fall on their faces. They can’t find jobs; or the jobs they do find pay really low (like $40Kish a year with $200K in law school debt with accruing interest); the few people who do get nice offers, such as $160,000+ for their first law gig are literally Harvard law school grads who graduate top of their class. Only a handful of law schools in this country got that kind of clout to get their alumni into white-shoe law firms. Every other school is weak.
Yeah I know, because a few friends went to some tier-3 toilet and are in massive debt and without jobs. It’s a fraud. 
Go to med school instead if you can hack the B,C,P,M courses and kill the MCAT.
Law school ruined my life! I have no job and I have student loan debt that will follow me to my grave. Now is a horrible time to go to law school. Save yourself; DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL!

Recent USC alumnus Kevin Herald graduated a semester early, but not because he finished his coursework before the standard four years as an undergraduate. Herald dropped his second major in theatre so that he could graduate with his political science degree in December, instead of receiving both degrees in the spring, because he does not want to incur the expense of another semester in college.
Herald originally chose to attend USC after high school because of the stellar financial aid package that was offered to him.
“I came here with a lot paid for,” Herald said. “There was very little in loans. It was mostly grant aid.”
Before the start of his sophomore year, however, Herald said his financial situation changed drastically. His sister graduated from college, causing his Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) to skyrocket. His financial aid award suddenly consisted largely of loans, which replaced a significant amount of the grants he received his freshman year.
In addition, Herald’s parents were unable to acquire the Parent PLUS loan, a federal fixed-rate loan for parents of dependent undergraduate students, because of bad credit. Their house had been foreclosed on several years earlier, and the foreclosure was still on their credit report.
Just before his junior year, Herald said his loans increased even more, while grants continued to decrease.
“There was a lot of freaking out over what we’re going to do,” Herald said. “[The Office of Financial Aid] only suggested getting loans from other groups, but that comes with significant interest. I’m one of four siblings, and they don’t calculate that my parents are saving up for college for my younger siblings, plus trying to save for retirement and pay off debt. They’re just like, ‘What can you pay?’”
Herald is just one of many students at USC who has experienced significant changes to their financial aid packages during their time as a student. Though the Office of Financial Aid warns that any change to a family’s circumstance could affect the EFC — which is calculated separately by the federal government and the university — many students and their families are nonetheless faced with the challenge of paying for an education at a higher price than they planned.
Meeting full need
According to USC’s financial aid website, more than 60 percent of students receive some type of financial assistance. Financial aid consists of a combination of grants, loans and federal work study allotments, which allow students with financial need to work part time to earn money for college.
Dean of Financial Aid Thomas McWhorter said that USC operates by a policy of meeting the “full need” of its students.
“USC evaluates the financial strength of a family each year and provides a financial aid award to meet the student’s need,” McWhorter said.
In the “Frequently Asked Questions” section of the Office of Financial Aid website, it is stated that USC attempts to maintain the initial award offered to students, but only under specified conditions.
“USC makes every attempt to offer the same amount of aid to students every year—assuming that you meet all deadlines and renewal criteria, your family circumstances remain the same and funding is available,” the website states.
One of the most significant factors in determining the amount of aid a student will receive is the EFC. The EFC is determined by the federal government for the distribution of federal aid, such as the Stafford Loan, using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. USC also determines EFC separately using a process known as institutional methodology, since the university is providing the primary share of the need-based grant funding, McWhorter said.
Institutional methodology adjusts for losses and changes allowed in the federal tax return system that do not generally affect a family’s ability to contribute to educational expenses and might include additional review of assets such as home equity and business worth, according to McWhorter.
“There are things that work on both sides of the equation,” McWhorter said. “In the majority, institutional [methodology] probably will lead to a higher family contribution [than federally determined EFC], but there are instances in which it results in a lower contribution.”
McWhorter said several factors might cause a student’s financial aid package to decrease in the years following his or her freshman year, including an increase in family income or assets, a decrease in the number of children in the family who are enrolled in college or a failure to complete the application on time.
The EFC for a student also might change due to job loss or reduction; a change in income; a one-time income, illness or medical expenses; payment for private elementary or secondary education, among other financial situations. McWhorter said special circumstances are reviewed, which might decrease the EFC and result in a larger aid award.
According to Mark Kantrowitz, a nationally recognized expert on student financial aid and senior vice president and publisher of            Edvisors.com, a website dedicated to financial planning for college, what students might consider a minor change in family circumstance could have a drastic impact on financial aid awards.
“Every $10,000 difference in student income will correspond to a $5,000 difference in the amount of aid a student receives,” Kantrowitz said. “Every $10,000 difference in parent income is a $3,000 difference in aid. The number of children in college at the same time can also have a tremendous effect on aid eligibility.”
“Bait and switch”
According to Kantrowitz, changes in aid during a student’s time in college are not uncommon.
The practice of a decreasing grants in favor of loans for continuing students is known as “front loading” of grants. Front loading of grants means that the financial aid package a student receives as a college freshman is more generous than the financial aid package he or she receives as a sophomore, junior or senior, according to Kantrowitz.
“It’s a form of bait and switch,” Kantrowitz said. “They’re trying to recruit a student as a freshman, and once they’re there, they are much less likely to switch to a different institution.”
Front loading of grants is evidenced by examining whether a student’s overall amount of aid has remained the same from year to year but the amount of grants decreased and the amount of loans increased, compared to the overall amount of aid changing.
According to McWhorter, USC does not front load grants for freshmen.
“USC does not have a policy of front loading grants to incoming students and decreasing them in subsequent years,” McWhorter said. “We’re going to evaluate the family’s financial strength each year though because federal aid is year dependent. So every year we’re collecting information on income and assets, which also change. Changes in loan and grant amounts are general more of a result of a change in family circumstances.”
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 59 percent of first-year students at USC received grants, while 62 percent of the overall undergraduate population received grants in the 2012-2013 school year. Also that year, 34 percent of USC freshmen received loans, while 38 percent of upperclassmen used loans to finance their education. The report, however, does not indicate the average ratio of grants to loans for students.
Aside from a policy of front loading, Kantrowitz said other nuances of the financial aid system might cause loans to increase as grants decrease.
The Stafford Loan, a form of fixed-rate federal financial aid, has a higher maximum loan amount for college sophomores, juniors and seniors, than for freshmen. Kantrowitz said schools often award loans before grants, causing the total loan amount to increase, while the previous amount of grants decreases.
McWhorter confirmed that this increase in loan limit for older students could lead to changes in grants.
“Over time there is an increase in the amount of loan and work, and it’s not a reduction against the grant. It’s not unusual that you will see a reduction [in grants] only based on those increases,” McWhorter said.
In addition, when a student wins a merit-based scholarship, grants are also often reduced.
“One  of the common misconceptions is that outside scholarships can help with the family contribution,” McWhorter said. “Where federal aid is involved, I have to count it as a resource. Family contribution is just that, from the family.”
According to McWhorter, USC makes an effort to preserve need-based grants for students who receive need-based scholarships, but most often, a new merit-based scholarship will reduce a students’ loan and work-study award.
A heavy burden
Allison Begalman, a junior majoring in writing for screen and television, said that a reduction in her work-study amount from year to year during her time at USC has caused her financial hardship and emotional distress.
Begalman has worked at five different jobs in her three years as a student. When she received a lower number of work-study hours for her sophomore year than for her freshman year, Begalman was forced to take on a second, non-work-study job to supplement the newly lowered earnings from her first job as a student worker in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Begalman believes her financial aid package changed so drastically because she received a one-time, merit-based scholarship from the School of Cinematic Arts during her freshman year, which would apply to her sophomore year tuition.
Working two jobs in addition to her classes was stressful for Begalman. She eventually quit her job at Annenberg in order to dedicate more time to her higher-paid, non-work study position.
“I felt really bad having to leave Annenberg,” Begalman said. “My boss was really good to me, and I liked the people, but I had no choice financially.”
In her junior year, Begalman’s work study amount was raised, but she chose to remain at her non-work study job because it still provided her with a higher salary than her work study allotment and she enjoyed the work.
During her sophomore year, Begalman appealed the changes to her work-study amount, but her appeal was denied. According to McWhorter, the Office of Financial Aid has processed more than 1,000 appeals so far in the 2014-2015 school year. He said more than 90 percent of the appeals were approved and resulted in an adjustment to students’ financial aid awards.
“[Granting an appeal is] based on our ability to find something we didn’t do correctly the first time, or there’s additional circumstances that should be looked at, or we’re going to exercise professional judgment,” McWhorter said.
McWhorter also acknowledged that in some instances, a student’s appeal might be approved, but no additional funds will be awarded. This situation occurs if the Office of Financial Aid recognizes a change in circumstance but those circumstances do not account for additional need. For example, if a student is granted an appeal to lower a high EFC, but the new EFC combined with the aid award is above the price of tuition, no additional funds will be awarded.
John Zamora, a junior majoring in international relations, is no stranger to the appeals process. He appealed his financial aid award as an incoming freshman and prior to his junior year.
Zamora said that his appeals were granted, but as an upperclassman, the new award was given in mostly loans with some grants, and as an incoming freshman, the amount was covered in full by grants.
“I know that loans are considered financial aid because the rate is subsidized while you’re in college, but I don’t really consider them aid because I still have to pay that back,” Zamora said. “I basically have six months after I graduate from college to get a job to support myself and to start paying off all this debt.”
Zamora applied to colleges as a QuestBridge Scholar, a program that matches high-achieving, low-income students with colleges that can meet their financial needs. Though he feels that USC is generous in the financial aid they give to students, he said the changes to his financial aid package have been a source of anxiety during his time at USC.
“It’s stressful for students because I feel like most low-income students have parents who aren’t great with these things,” Zamora said. “So all the stresses aren’t really on the parents, it’s on the students. Because if you go home and say, ‘It’s going to be thousands more for me to go to school this year. I hope you can afford that,’ that’s on you, you have to deal with that so that you can earn your degree.”
McWhorter acknowledged that many students and families are unsatisfied with the amount of aid they receive, including those students whose parents are dealing with financial burdens other than paying for college, such as personal debt. Consumer debt is not considered in any of the Office of Financial Aid’s calculations.
“Obviously I say I provide full need, but that’s my calculated need I hear from families, and I know some families think this is great, but others still think they have more need than I’m willing to recognize,” McWhorter said. “That’s the hard part of the job.”
Though Herald graduated early, he will now have to face the burden of paying off his student loans sooner than he originally planned.
“I don’t know where my future is headed,” Herald said. “I could be making $20K or $200K. I don’t know if the outcome is even going to be something that is worth it. You come to USC for the opportunity, but things can go in such a different direction. In not choosing to major in business or engineering, I feel like I made a mistake. Me doing liberal arts, why did I do that?”
Herald stressed that he believes the Office of Financial Aid needs to use a more holistic approach to evaluating students’ individual need for financial aid, rather than just taking the numbers into account.
“They have an algorithm, but they don’t understand anything beyond the math,” Herald said.
For anyone who graduates college (or leaves college) with loans that are federal based (almost ALL loans to undergraduates at a non profit college)….you can go to a wonderful website maintained by the federal govt-allowing you to find answers to questions, and apply for reduced payments and/graduated payments based on your income, OR deferral of payments if you are unemployed. Yes there are official routes to apply for this benefit, but it is not that difficult. Just get your personal income and circumstantial info together, and go here myfedloan/org    IT WORKS!! we did it and my daughter pays on $59 per month staring in her 7th month after graduating from USC.

Experts speculate that the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will be used as a temporary stadium for the St. Louis Rams should the NFL team move to Los Angeles.
Rams owner Stan Kroenke teamed up with Stockbridge Capital Group, an independent real estate investment firm, to unveil plans to develop 298 acres of land in Inglewood, the site of the former Hollywood Park racetrack. The mixed-use development will feature a world-class stadium that seats 80,000, a 6,000-seat performance venue, alongside retail, office hotel and residential space.
The Rams moved from Southern California to St. Louis at the end of the 1994 season.
Kroenke has been lobbying for a new stadium to be built for the team in St. Louis, which he hopes will receive public financing, but has been unsuccessful in reaching an agreement as of late. The Rams have the option to become year-to-year tenants at their current home, the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis, on Jan. 28.
Kroenke and Stockbridge have stated that the new development in Inglewood would not require public funding, though an Associate Press review has found that the developers expect to recoup nearly $100 million in local tax dollars after the first five years of operation.
Official reports state that it will take roughly two years for a new stadium to be built for the team should they decide to move, thus opening the doors for the Rams to play temporarily either at the Coliseum, home to USC football, or Rose Bowl Stadium, home to UCLA football.
In 2013, the university and the Coliseum entered into a 98-year lease agreement, which allows the school to operate and renovate the landmark structure.
“In that lease agreement, there is specific attention paid to the potential temporary return to that venue, it wouldn’t be something that they would have to go back to the state about, its already covered, in other words the possibility was anticipated when the deal was negotiated with USC,” said Los Angeles Police Commissioner President and Price School of Public Policy board member Steve Soboroff.
Arash Markazi of ESPNLosAngeles.com discussed the potential boost having an NFL team at the Coliseum would be for both the university and its football program.
“One of the things USC tries to do is say ‘Hey, we are your pipeline to the NFL.’ If they can be the home to an NFL football team even for just two seasons, I think that would help them do really well. You’re talking about a kid playing there on Saturday and then being able to go to an NFL game on Sunday. Now that the school is running the Coliseum it would be huge for them too, it would be more dates that they get the stadium full, parking full and concessions full,” Markazi said.
Los Angeles is no stranger to the NFL potentially moving to the area, as numerous teams have used the threat of Los Angeles as a way to gain public financing to build a stadium. The San Diego Chargers are currently going through this phase with the city of San Diego and have also been mentioned as a possible candidate for relocation.
“It does seem its more likely now than it has been in some time. It does seem like the league wants to return, but again, I think anyone who has been covering this or watching this from a far for twenty years, I don’t think we’re really going to believe it until it happens,” Markazi said.
Soboroff, who was instrumental in bringing the Staples Center to downtown Los Angeles added, “I am hopeful that the NFL returns to greater Los Angeles and I think that all the momentum is in the right direction, more so than ever.”
Jake Kelfer, a senior majoring in business administration, noted how some students would feel should an NFL team play at the Coliseum.
“Having an NFL team in Los Angeles would have a positive impact on USC students because it would give students another team to support. It would allow students the chance to attend more football games. Many students come from around the globe at USC and have never seen a professional football game, so this would give them that opportunity. For students that love football, this would provide them an opportunity to attend even more sporting events without having to travel very far,” Kelfer said.
On Jan. 9, former Anheuser-Busch President Dave Peacock and St. Louis attorney Bob Blitz announced a plan for construction of a 64,000-seat NFL stadium that would keep the Rams in St. Louis and open in 2020. The new development plan will cost more than $985 million and has been sent to the Rams and NFL officials.
If the NFL does play in the coli for a few seasons, USC will still find a way to gouge the Trojans football season ticket holders with PSLs and higher ticket prices.

Describing itself on its Facebook page as “an urban epicurean experiment and incredibly fun pop-up,” Living Breathing Kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles is certainly somewhat of a hidden gem. This pop-up restaurant prides itself on its of-the-moment brunch menu which changes on a weekly basis. Boasting a trendy setting and bottomless mimosas for $12, this is definitely the college student’s dream.
Admittedly, the restaurant was almost impossible to find. With no official website, certain directory websites have incorrect addresses listed. The Facebook page lists all the key information, and this writer eventually found the restaurant at 707 Grand Ave. Placed opposite Bottega Louie, the dining spot is certainly in the heart of Downtown LA’s culinary center.
Housed in the Coco Laurent Building, Living Breathing Kitchen boasts high ceilings and a grand entrance. Upon entering, however, it is clear that this is no longer a lavish French restaurant, but rather a stylish and laid-back brunch spot with colorful chalkboard lists of the specials. Diners can choose to sit on low black armchairs around small, round tables or in more classical dining chairs. An old-Hollywood, 1920s-style bar is the obvious center of the restaurant, with high, plush bar stools facing a wall at least five or six meters long, adorned with colorful bottles. Despite the extensive selection of alcoholic beverages, the only hot drinks are black coffee and tea, something that seemed slightly out of place for an establishment that prides itself on its brunch menu.
The space is cavernous with floor to ceiling windows and, despite being empty when we arrived, had two or three full tables by the time we left. With the wide French doors open on a very rainy day, it was undeniably cold when sitting and eating, but in the usual California sunshine this shouldn’t be much of an issue. The music was slightly obtrusive — a deep pounding bass-focused sound that is standard fare as backing music in many eateries — but the volume was far too high for it to truly be called background music, and was definitely somewhat intrusive on the experience.
The service was excellent. Casual, friendly and attentive waitresses were eager to offer guidance on the menu and assist in every way possible without ever being overbearing. Despite the difficulty in finding the location, the slightly drafty seating and a long wait for our order to arrive, the food was undeniably fantastic. The chocolate chip pancakes were deliciously sweet, and the maple syrup was mild and did not mask the other flavors. All the tastes were pleasant, gentle and not overpowering. The bacon was perfectly crisped and salted, complementing the pancakes. The Tres Leches French Toast was equally delicious and certainly unique. Served with seasonal fruit, tres leches sauce (a sweet, milky sauce popular in South America), caramel and candied toasted almonds, this dish is a delight for anyone with a sweet tooth. The light consistency of the bread prevented it from being sickly and added a slightly savory flavor to the mixture of sweet ones.
The food is also beautifully presented, with the French toast laid out like a fan with the berries and almonds artfully placed around and underneath. Many of the dishes look like works of art themselves, the kind you might find in restaurant located in the penthouse of a fancy hotel.
Other dishes offered include several exotic variants on eggs Benedict, traditional full English breakfast options, vegan biscuits with gravy and a popular rabbit hash. These many selections lead to a unique and diverse dining experience.
For such a trendy restaurant in a chic area, one might expect prices to be sky high. However, this was far from true in the case of Living Breathing Kitchen. As previously stated, bottomless mimosas were priced at just $12. In addition, all the pancake options came to $10 (or $8 without chocolate or fruit), the French toast came to $12 and sides averaged around $3. While not quite fast-food cheap, this is certainly cheap in comparison to many other high-class brunch restaurants, and especially its pricey neighbor Bottega Louie. The proximity to the University Park Campus is a bonus; this might not be a restaurant that one would be willing to travel across the city to frequent, but the fact that it’s only about a 10 to 15 minute drive away definitely makes it worth a visit.
The Living Breathing Kitchen will only be located in its downtown home of the Coco Laurent Building for 60 days, from its opening on Jan. 2. While it’s here, it’s definitely worth a trip for a meal that is both delicious and easy on the wallet.

“Every Day Sacred,” a USC Fisher Museum of Art exhibition featuring paintings by Los Angeles artist Dan McCleary, immediately engages the viewer with subtle intensity. Upon entry, the viewer is visually arrested by the woman in McCleary’s painting “Seven-Eleven.” She stares with a look of intense concentration, causing the viewer in turn to examine the painting with equal focus. The strikingly rich greenness of the woman’s uniform catches one’s attention, as does the subtle symmetry and balance throughout the painting.
This is the genius of McCleary’s work — with the theme of focus and introspection, his paintings capture the remarkability of everyday events. They engage the audience with seemingly mundane scenes even as his subjects engage intensely with their surroundings.
“Dan McCleary’s paintings, his minimalistic and elegant compositions with classical and art historical references, have gravitas and authenticity, and speak to a contemporary sensibility,” said exhibit curator Ariadni Liokatis. “They are intimate and psychologically charged portraits of the human condition, and a celebration of the ‘every day sacred.’”
“Every Day Sacred” is located behind the two galleries of permanent exhibitions at the Fisher Museum. The first room of the solo exhibition includes an introductory sign written by Liokatis, which describes the artist’s background information and key themes. This room contains five paintings, one of which is “Seven-Eleven.” The uniformed woman gazes inexorably from the viewer’s left, causing the viewer to pause just as he enters the exhibit.
The next room is a larger gallery containing 11 paintings. It is this second room of the exhibit that truly showcases McCleary’s themes of private introspection and the sacred nature of ordinary events. The larger number of paintings causes the viewer to notice similar motifs. In each piece, people are engrossed in contemplation. In some of them, the articles of contemplation are physical objects: a statue, as in “The Blue Guide II;” a card, as in “The Performer;” or their fingernails, as in “The Manicure.” In some, the subjects focus on things unpictured, as in “The Channel Surfer,” where a reclining man gazes at some object offscreen. In “The Dancers,” the man depicted focuses on himself, with closed eyes and a look of thoughtful introspection.
In some paintings, such as “Protection,” characters gaze unapologetically at the viewer. McCleary depicts this direct gaze with subtle power, as if the person were studying the audience or waiting patiently for the viewer to speak. The atmosphere of the gallery is profoundly meditative, accented by its simple and clean layout. The paintings are evenly spaced in a straightforward manner, as if mirroring the candid way in which McCleary’s characters inspect their audience. Even the objects in McCleary’s paintings sustain a sense of concentration — McCleary’s interior landscapes are free of clutter, causing the viewer to focus on the isolated soap dispenser or Styrofoam cup.
This symbiotic relationship that McCleary creates between the paintings’ focused mood and viewers’ contemplative perception draws out the curious significance of everyday moments. The characters and their undivided absorption, whether concerning physical objects or their own thoughts, invite the audience into their cognitive ruminations. The viewer is led to examine the characters’ settings in order to discover why they are thus engrossed. Additionally, McCleary’s spatial use of minimalist isolation encourages the audience to become aware of the peculiar loveliness of everyday objects, which would normally remain unnoticed. The spotlight is on the underlying sense of balanced symmetry of the cash registers and coffee pots in “Seven-Eleven,0” on the contrast between a red nail polish bottle and a white tablecloth in “The Manicure.”
McCleary’s paintings point to the extraordinary and the deeply psychological within the superficially mundane. The unique magnetism of moments that would normally shy away from advertisement are showcased — the private minute before a performer goes onstage, the man weighing himself in a bathroom. “Every Day Sacred” urges the audience to decelerate and to realize the latent epiphanies in the creases of a sleeve and color value of a uniform.
To complement the themes of introspection and awareness of beauty in “Every Day Sacred,” the Fisher Museum will offer a series of mindfulness classes, beginning Jan. 15, from 10 to 11:20 a.m. Classes will be held in the Dan McCleary exhibition space.
“As the title of the exhibition indicates, [McCleary’s] work speaks to the ‘every day sacred,’ the appreciation of life’s quotidian moments, a reflection on the value of one’s daily and familiar experiences and encounters,” Liokatis said. “Mindful meditation encourages one to pay attention to present moment experiences, to pause and connect with one’s inner experience in order to be more engaged and feel fully present in one’s life.”
“Every Day Sacred” opens Jan. 14, 2015, and will close March 7, 2015. In “A Conversation with Dan McCleary” at the Fisher Museum, McCleary will give a talk about his paintings on Feb. 3, 2015 at 1 p.m.

Despite its central location in Los Angeles and close proximity to the USC campus, Skid Row isn’t a common destination for students and the people of Los Angeles. This is no surprise, as it is far from a picturesque area, with one of the largest stable populations of homeless people in the U.S. camped along the street beside run-down buildings. Although the area is effectively out of sight and out of mind for the vast majority of L.A. residents, USC alumnus John Hwang is striving to change that. With his Skid Row Stories website, he is attempting to be a self-described “bridge” to the people of Skid Row.
At first glance, the site is reminiscent of the vastly popular Humans of New York, where photographer Brandon Stanton collects portraits of New Yorkers on the streets and shares short excerpts of his conversations with them. All of Hwang’s posts lead with a powerful photo and continue with a short story about his interaction with the subject of the photo. However, as one goes through the posts, it becomes abundantly clear that this is an entirely different animal from HONY. Where Stanton’s posts offer short glimpses into the lives of thousands of people, Hwang’s work is much more personal. He develops relationships with his subjects and often features the same person multiple times on his page.
If one walks with Hwang around Skid Row, it becomes abundantly clear how much he cares about his subjects.
When we were walking, he ran into a man named Walter who he has been interacting with for about a year and a half. The second Walter saw him, his eyes lit up and he rushed over to give Hwang a bear hug. Walter joined our party and pushed his shopping cart beside us as he shared everything that had happened to him since he had last seen John. The enthusiasm was that of a man who knows he is talking to someone who cares about what he is saying. Beyond his unbroken interest, his generosity was also on display. It was rainy and Hwang tried to give Walter his umbrella many times. Walter ultimately refused the gift but accepted a hot meal in its place. The stories flowed from Walter as he ate, and after pausing to take a picture when he had finished, they parted ways, again with a big hug from Walter. A few hours later, the update on Walter was up on the website. The feedback, as usual, was very warm. Walter talked at length about the positive response he received online after being featured on the website. He eventually teared up when talking about how one person told him that he was an inspiration because of his recycling efforts.
Walter’s story is an excellent demonstration of what this website can do. At first glance, he is not the sort of person one would strike up a conversation with. He shuffles along with his shopping cart. His speech is very slurred and difficult to understand, and his movements sputter. But beyond the initial and superficial, Walter’s incredible warmth comes through. This is a perfect representation of Hwang’s overall goal with Skid Row Stories.
The idea for the website first came to Hwang when he was a USC student volunteering with his church to feed the homeless on Skid Row.
“I began to notice that everyone was so focused on feeding as many people as they could that they weren’t taking the time to get to know these people so I went to the side and started to strike up conversations with people who were coming.”
Hwang said he believes that establishing a relationship with the homeless at Skid Row is an important aspect of helping them to improve their lives.
“You have to invest your time in order to develop the sort of relationships you need in order to make a difference.”
Hwang has certainly done that. He has been running Skid Row Stories for about two years and since its inception, he has sold off most of his possessions and moved into a small garage in order to focus on working on the website after work. Most nights of the week, Hwang walks around Skid Row with his camera until 2 a.m., looking for people to talk to and feature on the site.
“It has to happen organically,” Hwang said. “You can’t force a connection with these people. Some of these people have serious mental illnesses or drug addictions and that sometimes makes it next to impossible to strike up a conversation with them. But often it’s something as simple as seeing someone with something cool on a T-shirt and making a comment on it and going forward from there.”
It is this ability to establish a rapport with his subjects that allows this site’s stories so be so powerful. The featuring of  the same subject many times introduces the element of time to the storytelling, and this, in turn, causes the subjects to become more real than HONY’s snapshots of people in a particular moment in time. This sort of impact is what Hwang is looking to create with his photos.
“I’m trying to be a bridge to these people by showing that they’re all really people with their own stories,” he said.

When Kaley Cuoco, star of the popular television series, The Big Bang Theory, told Redbook Magazine in December that she did not consider herself a feminist, it sparked major controversy. In the magazine, Cuoco said, “I was never that feminist girl demanding equality. But maybe that’s because I’ve never really faced inequality.”
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Even though Cuoco later apologized on her Instagram for the statement, saying her words were “taken out of context,” followers accused her of not understanding the definition of the concept, one that is rooted in gender equality.
Cuoco seems to be one of many female celebrities who have publicly abandoned the word “feminism.” Actress Shailene Woodley, an advocate, according to Time, for movies empowering women, said she is not a feminist because she “love[s] men.” Time also reported others agreeing with Woodley. Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, both think feminism is an aggressive independence. As a nod to this issue, Time recently included feminist on its list of words to ban for 2015 (though they later apologized) because it has become an annoyance to hear celebrities state their opinion on the word.
What these female stars have failed to consider is that feminism comes with a simple explanation, one that they are complicating. The more coverage that emerges surrounding celebrities’ explanations for rejecting such a belief builds a stigma around the term. According to Salon, a study found its 228 American participants associating feminism with negative adjectives like “man-hating” and “unhygienic,” a view fueled by the portrayal by these female celebrities. The truth about feminism could not be further from this picture. Feminists are simply people who believe that men and women should be treated equally and fairly within society and under the law.
Cuoco, by saying that she has never experienced gender-based rejection, made a selfish move by ignoring the millions of women across the globe who do experience discrimination based on their sex. According to Equality Now, in 2012, 20.9 million people were sold into forced labor or sex slavery, of which 98 percent are female victims. Lack of access to reproductive health resulted in 12 percent of unwanted pregnancies and 289,000 childbirth deaths in 2013. And though organizations like Amnesty International are trying to stop sexual abuse, millions of women are raped and beaten on a daily basis. This is the reality that stands next to Cuoco’s inexperience. To disown feminism is to disown any kind of support or empathy for the millions of women who suffer from gender inequality. To disown feminism is to accept ignorance of issues that so obviously plague the world.
Ultimately, the problem with extensive media coverage of celebrities and organizations disowning feminism is the universal refusal to acknowledge the truth about gender inequality; it exists, and feminists want to fix it. Twisting feminism into a negative belief only isolates those affected by gender inequality; people who feel great effects of the words of celebrities.
A woman who claims she is not a feminist because she has never experienced inequality is as ludicrous as someone who refuses to acknowledge global warming because he or she has never experienced higher than average temperatures. They bludgeon a term that has been used to describe the crusade against gender injustice. Feminism, in turn, has been reduced to a debate about the righteousness of being a housewife and the desire for female dominance.
As Alice Paul, a feminist who nearly died for the right to vote, once said, “I never doubted that equal rights was the right direction. Most reforms, most problems are complicated. But to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary equality.” There is a social responsibility to women suffering around the world to simplify the conversation about feminism. The trivialization of a term could very well cost society its empathy towards all women affected by gender inequality.

There is no way to begin this piece without first stating that the massacre in Paris last week is not justifiable in any way. Such violence is tragic, and regardless of what prompted the violence, a human being must be, to some degree, delusional to take a human life, let alone 12 of them.
It must also be stated that the freedoms of speech and of the press are crucial to the framework of a just society. Without honest, free voices coming from both citizens and journalists, nothing would ever challenge the status quo.
France, the United States and the rest of the developed, Western world are in a uniquely privileged position in which we typically do not experience such large-scale violence, nor are the members of the press frequently persecuted when they express their beliefs.And, when such crimes do occur, they are dealt with as just that: crimes. Those at fault are prosecuted by the law and despised by the people.
Unfortunately, such is not the case in much of the rest of the world. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 734 journalists were murdered because of their work in the last 22 years. Last year, of the 27 journalists murdered only one received even partial justice. Two hundred twenty-one journalists were imprisoned last year alone, the second-highest number on record since the organization started counting in 1990.
The privileged position Western journalists are in have put them not only in the best position to advocate for their own interests, but also to advocate for change in places like China, Iran and Syria where their contemporaries are more likely to be silenced. If free presses ignore this window of opportunity or do not take it seriously, they are not only hurting themselves, but greatly disrespecting those still fighting for the right to print a newspaper at all.
If Charlie Hebdo were a late-night comedy show, its stabs would not be so controversial. Unfortunately, its political cartoons aren’t displayed at 2 a.m. on Comedy Central but on newsstands across France. Caricatures of nude religious leaders are not only wildly offensive, but also represent basic yellow journalism. Perhaps this tactic is productive in attracting a few extra readers, but it certainly cannot spark meaningful discussion.
The writers must have known that they were under some level of threat, especially after the firebombing at their office four years prior. They believed their mockery of religious leaders was worth that threat being realized, and that it was Charlie Hebdo’s right to express beliefs.
In a perfect world, the freedom of speech and press would mean that anyone could say whatever they wanted without offending anyone, even to the point of rage. Our world is far from perfect, however, and there will always be those who do not adhere to society’s rules.
The attack at Charlie Hebdo and the subsequent hostage situation at a kosher market were not attacks on freedom of speech. They were horrific crimes against France and against humanity. The press might, and ought to, continue exercising their rights and speaking their minds; this attack does should not prevent them from doing so.
That being said, it is important to step back from this tragedy and consider the privilege given to Western journalists. Pulitzer Prize winner and chair of the board of directors for Cartoonists Rights Network International Joel Pett says that the incident should serve to remind cartoonists that given their privilege, they must “draw about something that matters.”
There are no heroes in this story, barring the brave servicemen and women on the ground in France. What remains is not an unbridled war on free press, but instead a world in which the stakes of quality journalism are higher. Hopefully, publications such as Charlie Hebdo choose to use that freedom wisely.

It is the job of western media to speak the truth and if that means hurting the oh-so sensitive feelings of those who defile free speech and all other personal freedoms, and of those who attack our freedoms then so be it.
Claire, as a responsible western journalist I encourage you to write an article about Mohammed’s practice in the slave trade, about his enslavement and sexual abuse of women, about his forcing sex upon a nine year old girl.
If you truly respected journalistic freedom and its history in uncovering the truth behind lies then you should act on your words and write about Mohammed’s perverted values.

On Jan. 7, 12 people who worked for Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were shot dead by Islamic extremists, with others sustaining brutal injuries. According to Los Angeles Times, the two gunmen aimed to “avenge the prophet Mohammed,” as Charlie Hebdo had released publications over the years sardonically critiquing the religion. In their attack that shocked the world, the terrorists have also stunted the freedom of expression, which includes intellectual criticism exemplified by the French magazine.
Freedom of expression is a core value in Western societies. It is a concept on which the United States was founded and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said was a “key component of our free democratic culture” in her address about the massacre. Though it cannot be prescribed to all countries due to the basis of their governments, it is essential to inspire people, no matter their origin, to challenge oppressive, conventional ideas, and speech is the most effective way to inspire this necessary change.
In a setting where free speech is afforded to all citizens, opinions flow among many people. Discriminatory remarks can be said to attack certain groups of peoples — racist or anti-religious remarks, for example. That is generally viewed as the most negative consequence of the freedom of speech. Free speech is important in this scenario, however, because derogatory remarks can be inhibited through outcries demanding minority support. Dichotomous opposition is a balanced, yin-yang force. In turn, education silences the ignorance that is inevitable in any community.
This goes for the Charlie Hebdo published works as well. The magazine has been known for its offensive illustrations of not just Muslims, but people of other cultures as well. Their offense does not represent the stagnation of acceptance. On the contrary, it symbolizes the preservation of the free world, the one that Merkel touts. Charlie Hebdo supports the cycle of a two-sided discussion that will eventually spur a flourishing of different ideas.
Furthermore, it is our social responsibility to strike passive attitudes and speak our thoughts. No institution should be exempt from scorn, as they contain artificial, man-made aspects. People belong to these institutions, ones like a government that decrees laws to follow, or religion, which outlines a follower’s conduct. Unless we critique these institutions, they will never change. Religion is centuries-old for a reason and is embedded into the very fiber of people’s identities, yet it produces sects that are startlingly radical, as exemplified by these recent terrorist attacks. By speaking out on the blasphemy, people are taking a stance on how to improve other people’s lives. And the people of Charlie Hebdo were tragically sacrificed for their weapon to effect change: speech.
Ignoring these conflicts is not the answer, but silencing opinions will not eliminate social injustice either. The best, most productive conversations are ones that have opposing views, ones that, in the end, promote social welfare for all people.
Hopefully, what will happen will look something like what the artist Lucille Clerc drew in response to the incident. Yesterday, our pencils, or our ability to freely express ourselves, were unscathed. Today, that right has been snapped in half, severely crippled. Tomorrow, our temporary defeat might catalyze more expressions, new pencils that arise from the broken ones. But before we can grow from this tragedy, we must realize that issues of free speech impact us all, and that we are all Charlie.

Last week, President Barack Obama announced the proposal, dubbed “America’s College Promise,” to provide free community college tuition nationwide — a concept that, while bold and revolutionary, requires a closer look at its effectiveness. Though the proposal faces opposition in the Senate, presumably because of the $60 billion price tag, it is the ineffective measures of the bill itself that warrant reconsideration.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
Advocates of Obama’s proposal praise his initiative to finally solidify an executive commitment to the affordability of college, and indeed, the astronomical cost of college is perhaps the biggest crisis facing higher education. The price of higher education in the United States becomes even more absurd when pitted against international counterparts; according to a 2010 report by the International Ranking Expert Group Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence, the United States had the highest student cost at $13,856, while the second and third were Finland at $1,243 and Germany at $933 respectively. It is almost impossible to believe that the United States provides higher education at more than 11 times the price of the next priciest country. For lower income communities, the price of college is an especially cruel catch-22; a country that prizes higher education as the gateway to a better financial life requires financial means.
It is not wrong, then, to tout that this presidential push for reform will incite reservations about the most effective approaches to improving higher education. But through these conversations, the futility of the practical effects of this specific proposal will hopefully make itself apparent.
At face value, the notion of making college “the norm in the same way high school is the norm now,” as White House Director of Domestic Policy Cecilia Muñoz said, seems noble. And transforming the K-12 model to essentially a K-community college model seems like exactly the solution that a generation of debt-ridden college students have been begging for — a silver bullet to providing more skills and access aimed at a low-income demographic unable to afford college or the private loans they may be forced to take out. But the greatest obstacle the proposal faces is that its target demographic just misses the mark — the poorest students qualify for Pell grants, which cover the cost of community college, leaving middle-class students, who can usually afford community college anyway. The $60 billion supports students who don’t really need it.
The proposal tries but fails to close the education access gap between the rich and the poor. If the federal government is really committed to making college universal, then they must more carefully scrutinize the access barriers that prevent 80 percent of community college students from getting their degree in three years, instead of assuming that attrition is due to high tuition costs. Rather than spending $60 billion on eliminating community college tuition, the federal government can spend it to improve community college programs and resources which can keep students on track for graduation.
Admittedly, Obama’s proposal made some commitment, however lackluster it may be, to improving the quality of community colleges by including a clause that requires community colleges to prove “promising and evidence-based institutional reforms” to receive the federal tuition money. These institutional reforms should be the basis of a bill to change the landscape of community colleges, not a side provision. Educators and politicians should meet to consider optimization of resources and individualized attention so that community colleges can keep their students motivated to complete their degree program.
The Obama administration was correct in assessing that college tuition is too expensive. They targeted the wrong students, for many of whom tuition remains a major barrier. At Los Angeles City College, a major community college in Los Angeles, tuition is at most $1,656 a year. Compare that cost with tuition at UCLA, the closest major public four-year university — $12,696 for the academic year. If the federal government is looking for low-income college students to support, those who attend four-year universities are in desperate need.

Allow me to state the obvious: The media landscape is rapidly evolving.
Though, for journalists, this evolution feels like the breaking news story that won’t quit. The Daily Trojan does not typically report on the state of the media — print or otherwise — because it’s simply not why we’re here. To discuss the challenges we face as a news source in the digital age seems awfully self-serving, but frankly, I don’t think it’s something that we can, or should, ignore any longer.
Media organizations have been battling for your attention for years. Publications are doing everything they can to make sure that when you log on to your computer or unlock your phone, you seek out their content and not the competition’s. And despite the cutthroat, dog-eat-dog nature of this media war, it’s ultimately you, the reader, who benefits from the plethora of information at your disposal.
New ways to consume this information permeate our lives every day — apps are developed, blogs are posted, tweets are tweeted  — and the Daily Trojan is part of that change. We, as your premier resource for campus news, have an obligation to provide you with stories you want to read in the format you want to read them in, and you as our readers have a right to know how we are striving to do just that.
This semester, look out for changes to our online presence. We will be providing you with more content on a wider range of topics. There will be new blogs, videos and podcasts, all of which will serve as a new way to expand our coverage of life at USC. We understand that you want your news on the go, and we’re here to provide that.
There are, however, a few things that will not change.
The Daily Trojan has been around for a long time, and for good reason. Our commitment to honest, original reporting has allowed us to fulfill our mission to cover this campus for the past 103 years. Though the stories that fill these pages might not always be the flashiest, they are written with students in mind.
As editor in chief, my goal is to make the Daily Trojan relevant to you. A campus newspaper should facilitate discussion about the university it serves. It should be the watchdog of the campus. It should be something you look forward to reading every day.
I want you to look to us for not only USC news, but also for blogs, reviews, editorials, game recaps, even photos of what happened on campus yesterday. I want you to think of us when you wonder about that ominous Trojan Alert, or when you see a police car speeding along the perimeter of campus. Most of all, I want you to tell us what you think. Tell us what you want to read, tell us what we should be doing more of and, of course, tell us what we’re doing wrong and why.
USC will no doubt continue to change this semester, as it has each semester since its establishment. But we’ll be here, too, faithfully bringing the stories of this campus to you every day. It’s a job that we will not take for granted.
Continue doing what you guys do. It’s great and allows, even us alimni, a chance to read about what’s going on at the campus.
