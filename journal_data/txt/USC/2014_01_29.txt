The No. 6 USC women’s tennis team is back in action today as they host No. 44 Pepperdine at Marks Stadium.
The Women of Troy (2-0, 0-0 Pac-12) are coming off back-to-back victories that helped them take home the title at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Kick-Off Weekend tournament last weekend. In that tournament, USC battled North Texas in the first round, coming out on top by a score of 4-0. In the championship match, the Women of Troy swept the St. Mary’s Gaels, 4-0. USC dominated throughout the tournament, not losing a single match in singles or doubles.
Juniors Zoë Scandalis and Giuliana Olmos, the seventh-ranked doubles pair in the country, cruised through the weekend without losing a single game.
“Me and my partner played great,” Scandalis said. “We had just won a tournament in Las Vegas so we were pretty high on confidence. I think that kind of transferred over, and we were just having fun.”
By winning the tournament, USC earned one of 16 spots in next months’ ITA National Indoor Team Championships in Charlottesville, Va.
Meanwhile, Pepperdine’s squad is coming into the matchup untested, as it did not compete in an ITA Kick-Off Weekend tournament.
Though Pepperdine hasn’t played a dual match yet this season, the Women of Troy know they have their work cut out for them.
“I know all of their kids and I’ve seen them play, so I would say this is the best team they’ve had in the last six or seven years,” said USC head coach Richard Gallien. “So we better be ready.”
The Waves are led by Lorraine Guillermo, who is ranked No. 19 in the nation in singles and No. 39 with her doubles partner, Ale Granillo. Pepperdine has five nationally ranked singles players to USC’s four, though USC has three ranked doubles teams to Pepperdine’s two.
USC’s highest-ranked doubles team, comprised of two newcomers in freshman Zoë Katz and senior transfer Brynn Boren, sits at No. 3 in the nation, while junior Sabrina Santamaria is ranked 13th in the country in singles.
Boren, who transferred from Tennessee this year, was sidelined by an injury during the ITA Kick-Off Weekend tournament, but will return to action in today’s match.
Though the teams have the same number of ranked players, USC still sits 38 spots ahead of Pepperdine in the rankings and comes into the match with intense momentum. Still, Gallien insists that the Women of Troy will need to stay focused.
“I think sometimes when in the back of your mind you know you’re going to win, that’s a little dangerous,” Gallien said. “I expect us to be more focused and more hungry for the duration [of the match].”
The action begins Thursday at 3 p.m. at Marks Stadium.

Following a loss to Cal State Northridge on Friday, the Trojans rebounded with a victory against Cal Baptist, winning in four sets, 25-13, 25-22, 21-25 and 25-21. USC’s record improves to 5-2 overall and 4-2 in conference play.
Diggin’ it · Senior libero Henry Cassiday leads his team with 77 digs so far this season, good enough for a career-high 3.5 digs per set average. The Honolulu, Hawaii native is a four-year starter for the Trojans. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans started the first set strong with kills by junior outside hitter Cristian Rivera, sophomore outside hitter Alex Slaught and freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh. Errors by Cal Baptist caused the Lancers to call an early timeout, as USC began to pull away with an 11-5 lead.
The timeout proved futile, as USC’s momentum could not be stopped. A block by Benesh and a kill by freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder extended the Trojans’ lead to 15-6. Consecutive aces from Micah Christenson brought the score to 23-9 in USC’s favor. An error by the Lancers set up game point for the Trojans and a kill by Slaught ended the first set in a 25-13 Trojan win.
“We served really well and put their offense under pressure,” said head coach Bill Ferguson. “Our transition kills were big for us and really helped us in the first set.”
In the second set, both teams committed errors that prevented the other from gaining an advantage. A kill by Slaught and a block by Rivera gave USC a 17-15 lead, though errors by the Trojans kept the Lancers in the game. A service error by the Lancers and a kill by Yoder, followed by a block by Lischke set up game point for USC. A kill by Rivera won the second set for the Trojans, 25-22.
The third set began much like the second, with neither team able to gain a significant lead over the other. Despite kills by Slaught and Yoder, the Lancers pulled ahead to a 24-20 lead, and the Trojans were unable to stop them. The Lancers won the third set, 25-21, to keep themselves in the match.
“Our errors killed us this set, and especially the timing of those errors,” Ferguson said. “They came right as we were building our momentum.”
The Lancers erased an early USC lead in the fourth set and would tie the game at 12. The Trojans regained their lead just as quickly, thanks to kills by Slaught and Yoder.
An error by the Lancers and a kill by Yoder set up match point for the Trojans. An ace by Christenson won the fourth set for the Trojans, 25-21.
“We went back to basics and we reset,” Rivera said. “We got our rhythm going again and we got ourselves back to the pace we wanted.”
The Trojans host Brigham Young University on Feb. 1 at 5 p.m. in the Galen Center.
“We have to focus on our passing and play defense against a team like BYU,” Slaught said. “We really have to come together and play like a team.”

What happened to USC baseball?
That is the question I set out to answer when I started writing this piece. What happened to the 12-time National Champions, the most successful program in the history of the sport? What happened to the team of Rod Dedeaux, the college baseball Coach of the Century? How can a program that had but two head coaches for 65 years have had three in the last four?
Naturally, I started where every other child of my generation would: I Googled it. Though the first hit was about the USC Trojans, more than half the results on the first page were about the baseball program at that other USC, South Carolina.
I have done a lot of Internet searching regarding USC athletic programs in my time here, and to see South Carolina pop up with that frequency is unheard of. Case and point: A Google search of USC men’s soccer — a sport which the Trojans do not even compete in — returns results for this school’s club team before South Carolina’s varsity program.
So, what happened to USC baseball?
First, the past: Rod Dedeaux served as the head coach of USC baseball for 45 years, guiding the Trojans to 11 National Championships and amassing 1,332 wins. When Dedeaux retired following the 1986 season, former player Mike Gillespie took over.
From 1988 to 2002, USC made a regional every year but one, including four appearances at the College World Series and a championship in 1998. But in 2004, USC suffered its first losing season in nearly 20 years. By the end of the 2006, Gillespie was out.
Officially, Gillespie “retired,” but it is no great secret he was forced out by then-Athletic Director Mike Garrett. After just one season of “retirement,” Gillespie was named the head coach at UC Irvine, where he guided the Anteaters to the NCAA regionals in each of his first four years there.
Gillespie was replaced by, ironically enough, his son-in-law Chad Kreuter — and it’s been all downhill from there.
Kreuter was 111-117 before being let go after the 2010 season. His replacement, Frank Cruz, was 48-63 before being fired for an NCAA violation before last season. And then that 2013 squad had the least wins of any Trojan team (20) since the 1957 team went 18-4.
“I think Kreuter was just in over his head at USC,” said Baseball America’s Aaron Fitt. “The Trojans had one of the best coaches on the West Coast in Mike Gillespie, and they ran him out of town for someone with very little college coaching experience and not much feel for how to build a college program.”
Indeed, the consensus regarding the demise of USC baseball stems from recruiting. College baseball’s relationship with its professional counterpart is not as straightforward as basketball or football. In baseball, a player coming out of high school is eligible to be drafted by a professional organization. Should a player decide to turn down the offer and attend college, he is not eligible for the draft again for three full years.
That creates a complicated guessing game for college coaches: You have to recruit talent, obviously. But focusing too much time and effort on a highly talented player is risky, because there is a good chance he won’t come to school at all.
“They got killed a couple of years where almost the whole class signed,” said current USC head coach Dan Hubbs, then the pitching coach at Cal. “That’s like the death penalty. It’s just really hard when you don’t have protection for those guys, and they didn’t.”
To a certain extent, players spurning school for the pros can be considered unlucky, but not when it becomes the trend, as it did under Kreuter.
“(Kreuter) didn’t do his homework very well,” said Perfect Game USA’s Kendall Rogers. “And you keep a coach like Kreuter for four years, with the recruits he lost, you’re gonna ruin the program.”
A professional baseball contract, even a small one, is quite the sum of money, especially to an 18-year-old kid. And this dilemma is further complicated at a place like USC. The NCAA allots baseball programs just 11.7 scholarships to divide amongst its team, meaning that with very few exceptions, every player will pay at least a portion of their tuition. That portion of tuition is much higher at USC than it is at, say, Cal State Fullerton.
“It’s not a matter of ‘do kids want to come to USC?’ That’s not the issue and never has been,” Hubbs said. “The only issue we have here is, ‘how do we make it affordable for a family?’ And then we have to do a good job on educating kids as to why this [school] is more beneficial than signing in the draft.”
Last year, the Trojans had six commits drafted. Five of them signed with pro teams.
“They need to be smart about which players they go after,” Fitt says. “Clearly, USC has lagged way behind most of the conference in this area over the last decade.”
So what happened to USC baseball? The answer appears to be simple: Chad Kreuter. That might not paint a complete picture, but it wouldn’t be wrong either.
 
Nick Burton has probably spent more time at Dedeaux Field over the last three years than he has in class. He plans to focus quite a bit on USC baseball in his column, “Any Given Saturday,” this semester. To plead with him to do otherwise, visit dailytrojan.com or email Nick at burtonn@usc.edu.
OK, nice article.  I learned a few things.  But, please, in “Recruiting Missteps Hurt USC Baseball, Part II” will you kindly let us know what is going in with the program right now?  Huh?  Like, who are we going after and why and what are the prospects and so on.  Pretend it’s football and the subject is worth a read.
Hiring Cruz certainly didn’t help either.  Worst hire in PH’s tenure (so far).

Quarterback Max Wittek will transfer to another school for his final two seasons of eligibility after graduating from USC in May, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Moving on · Max Wittek stepped in for an injured Matt Barkley at the end of the 2012 season before losing the starting job last season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Wittek, who enrolled at USC in January 2011, won’t have to sit out a season as most transfers do since the NCAA allows players who have graduated to transfer without penalty.
Wittek finishes his USC career with 600 passing yards, three touchdowns and six interceptions. He completed 50 of 95 passes, and the Trojans were 1-3 when he played at least a half.
“My journey has been a little bit different,” Wittek told the Los Angeles Times. “It didn’t work out with the traditional picture-perfect ending, but I definitely look back with a lot of positive feelings.”
The Mater Dei-Santa Ana High School graduate had hoped to succeed Matt Barkley as USC’s starting quarterback last season, but ultimately lost the job to redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler. Wittek was the presumed favorite after serving as Barkley’s backup during the 2012 season, but a poor performance in that season’s Sun Bowl opened up the quarterback competition.
After the pair split time under center for the first two games, former head coach Lane Kiffin tabbed Kessler as the starter. Kessler went on to lead USC to a 10-4 record while passing for 2,968 yards and 20 touchdowns against seven interceptions.
Though Wittek never managed to achieve the success attained by fellow Mater Dei graduates Barkley and Matt Leinart at USC, the quarterback says he doesn’t regret trying to follow in their footsteps.
“I’ve been through a lot and USC has helped me become the man I am today and there is no better place,” Wittek told the Los Angeles Times. “The Trojan Family is amazing … Getting my degree from such a great university will mean a lot, and ultimately, allowing me to play right away with two years to play was the best way to go.”
Wittek has yet to determine which school he will transfer to. His departure leaves USC with three scholarship quarterbacks for spring practice — Kessler, redshirt freshman Max Browne and freshman Jalen Greene, who enrolled in January after graduating early from Junipero Serra-Gardena High School.

The USC men’s basketball team (10-10, 1-6 Pac-12) will travel to Corvallis, Ore. following one of their most promising weeks of Pac-12 play and take on the Oregon State Beavers (11-8, 3-4).
Solid as a rock · Senior guard Pe’Shon Howard has averaged 10.1 points and a team-leading 4.1 assists per game while starting 20 of 21 games for the Trojans this season. Howard transferred from Maryland after the 2013 season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Head coach Andy Enfield’s squad is coming off of a week that saw them pick up their first conference victory of the year, beating Cal in convincing fashion.
The Trojans followed that up with a strong effort against the visiting Stanford Cardinal, keeping pace with them before eventually falling by 8 in overtime.
Oregon State will be no tough task for the Trojans. The Beavers are 8-2 in their last 10 in Corvallis, and redshirt junior guard Roberto Nelson is leading the Pac-12 in scoring, with just more than 22 points a game.
“This league is very good top to bottom,” Enfield said regarding the rigorous Pac-12 schedule.
Though the Trojans have not been able to put all the pieces together in conference play, their effort is undoubtedly there. Last season the Trojans had similar struggles, losing five out of their first eight Pac-12 games. There seems to be a marked difference in the two squads despite what the similar records might suggest.
Enfield’s team seems to put forth great effort every night, despite facing mounting struggles on the offensive end.
“The guys have had great attitudes and they’ve been very enthusiastic,” he said. “I’m very proud of our players.”
Though some of the younger players have struggled to find consistency this season, junior guard Byron Wesley has been a model of stability. Wesley comes into the game averaging 16.5 points and seven rebounds per contest.
For his part, Wesley thinks the Trojans need to follow his lead and find some on-court steadiness.
“We just need to stay consistent,” the Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native said. “Look at the film, grow, see our flaws, see what we do well, and continue to practice hard and prepare like we’ve been preparing.”
While Wesley’s stellar efforts will be required, he will certainly need some help to walk out with a win in Corvallis, something the Trojans have been unable to do in their last four road contests with the Beavers.
Some of that help may come in the form of freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic, who entered the season as a low-profile recruit but has his coaches raving about his progress.
For his efforts he has earned what seems to be a permanent place in the starting line-up, and his coach was clear when explaining why.
“We’re 8-1 when Nikola scores in double figures,” Enfield said. “Hopefully he understands that.”
Against California, Jovanovic certainly seemed to get that message, scoring a career-high 23 points while shooting a mind-boggling 80 percent from the field.
Some of his better performances have made Trojan fans and national scouts alike forget that Jovanovic is only 18, but, luckily for Enfield, his growing stardom has not translated into any sense of entitlement.
“It’s been awesome for me as a freshman,” Jovanovic said of his increased playing time.
His teammates seem to appreciate Jovanovic as well.
“Nikola is really talented,” Wesley said of his international teammate. “I’ve been really impressed with his work ethic.”
Jovanovic, Wesley and the rest of the team will have to continue to work hard, as the schedule only gets tougher.
Following the Oregon State game, the Trojans have a date in Eugene with the always talented Oregon Ducks. For now, however, USC will try to march into Corvallis and come out with their second conference win of the season.

In the first “Students Talk Back” event of the semester, Californian office members and Democratic and Republican students discussed President Barack Obama’s 2014 State of the Union address.
Breaking down Barack · Panelists (from left to right) Anthony Portantino, Shikhar Gupta, Tony Strickland and Jennifer Massey spoke on a panel on President Obama’s State of the Union address. The panel focused on economic inequality, climate change and partisan gridlock in Congress. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The event, entitled “Students Talk Back: A Politics and Public Policy Forum,” featured a panel consisting of former California Assemblymember of the 44th district Anthony Portantino, former California Senator serving the 19th district Tony Strickland, Vice President of the USC College Democrats Shikhar Gupta and President of the USC College Republicans Jennifer Massey.
The forum focused on key areas that President Obama presented in his address, specifically those that continue to be a pressing issue for partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C.
Portantino viewed the State of the Union address as a wake-up call for both parties in the Capital.
“Let’s put in place things that make the air cleaner, the water drinkable, our vehicles run more efficiently,” Portantino said. “Whether you’re a Republican or Democrat, [if] you leave your garage door closed [with the vehicle on,] you die. It shouldn’t even be a partisan conversation.”
Tony Strickland stressed that climate change is over-argued and will always be an ongoing issue.
Another major issue discussed was establishing economic equality. In his address, President Obama called –— an “equal pay for equal work” regardless of gender.
“Certainly as the father of two daughters who someday want to retire and [have them] take care of me, [I want them to be] extremely successful,” Portantino said.
Jennifer Massey believed that both parties should listen to each other and work to find common ground over the issues that U.S. citizens want addressed in 2014.
“I think that the issue that they could work on together would probably be creating job opportunity and reducing the federal budget deficit,” Massey said. “[There was] an NBC Wall Street Journal poll last week that asked what Americans thought were the biggest issues facing 2014 and about 91 percent said creating jobs and 74 percent [said] reducing the federal budget deficit.”
Many of the students attending the forum were able to ask panelists questions and engage in the debate.
Sam Dorn, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and political science, had mixed opinions toward the debate.
“I can’t say I agree with every point, but I don’t think you ever do,” Dorn said. “[It was] definitely a realistic look at [the] second term.”

A young face on USC’s faculty, Morgan Polikoff is well on his way to becoming a leading member at the Rossier School of Education.

Polikiff, who joined the Rossier staff in 2010, was recently ranked in a top public influence ranking by Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. He has focused his work on testing and accountability in schools.
Hess’ public influence ranking identifies university-based scholars who have had a heavy influence on public debates regarding education. Fellow Rossier faculty members Dominic Brewer, Mary Helen        Immordino-Yang and Katharine Strunk were also honored.
Though he hasn’t been on the scene for long, Polikoff’s research contributions have quickly launched him into prominence in the field of education.
One focus of Polikoff’s research involves the design of an accountability system for schools, which revolves around the No Child Left Behind policy. The policy outlines requirements such as annual testing for select grade levels, proficient level achievement on state tests and training for highly qualified teachers in order to improve education for disadvantaged students.
The major flaw of No Child Left Behind is that it identifies schools that need interventions solely based on test scores, Polikoff said. He stressed that with this strategy, the results are merely correlated with student demographics at a minimum and fail to measure student achievement growth.
His focus of accountability, rather, takes other factors such as graduation rates, attendance and student engagement into account in order to propose how states can achieve school accountability more effectively.
Another focus of Polikoff’s research is the implementation of the new Common Course State Standards. The CCSS describes what students should know and be able to do in the subjects English and mathematics by the end of each grade. Since 2010, 45 states have adopted this set of standards.
Polikoff  studies the effectiveness of implementation by looking at the curriculum materials and how well they are aligned with what the teachers are actually supposed to be teaching. The discrepancies play an important role in student achievement, Polikoff said.
“We have gaps in this country in terms of achievement and attainment,” he said.
Polikoff stressed that the United States’ meager education standing compared to other countries reflects the need for curriculum changes and reforms.
“There’s no question that we can do better in terms of these relevant standings,” Polikoff said.
Polikoff also asserted reform needs to be partially taken on by textbook companies. Currently, many textbook companies say that they are aligned to curriculum standards, when in fact they essentially “slapped a new sticker on the old book.”
Polikoff believes his job is to get this kind of information into the hands of educators so that they can make informed decisions about the best way to educate children.
His work, however, is not without controversy. In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, Polikoff discussed his opinion on the new state standard that requires education in cursive writing, stating that he  did not think of the requirement as such an important or necessary matter.
The story soon received a lot of attention, and Polikoff was asked to write a blog post for the New York Post. Some of the reactions to his opinion have been negative.
This kind of response, however, has not slowed down Polikoff’s work.  The assistant professor continually publishes articles, writes policy briefs and engages with people on social media sites such as Twitter to inform the public of the flaws he sees in the educational system.

The Interfraternity Council held a draft-like selection event on Jan. 28 for all IFC fraternities to select social event dates.
This process was put forth by IFC in compliance with the new university social event policies. All IFC fraternities were represented and given the opportunity to select dates for hosting social events at chapter houses throughout the semester.
According to a new university policy, the Dept. of Public Safety is allowing four chapter houses to host social events each weekend night, a maximum of 12 chapter events per weekend.
This policy only applies to The Row, meaning that a fraternity can host a social event off The Row without the event being counted toward the four event maximum.
IFC decided that a draft-like system was the easiest way to fairly choose dates for the semester.
IFC President Tanner Sandoval discussed how the university and Greek leadership created the new policies and processes for regulating and reforming social life at USC.
“This draft system seemed like the most fair and equitable way to let houses do what they wanted; everyone had the equal opportunity to choose the dates they wanted,” Sandoval said.
Phi Delta Theta social chair Tay Vaughn commented on how the process took place and the implications it has on the future of Greek social life at USC.
“The actual process was fairly simple and smooth,” Vaughn said. “I think generally people across the board were satisfied with the picks that they got,” Vaughn said.
Vaughn said there is still ambiguity on how the policy will turn out.
“I feel like we don’t really know how it’s going to play out yet. I am personally very optimistic about it, [but] we don’t know if people are going to follow the rules all the time,” he said.
Vaughn also spoke about how this draft selection was the beginning of the implementation of new social policies on campus.
“This first week is just a trial run,” Vaughn said. “The dynamics of social events have totally shifted. We don’t know how big parties are going to be [and] we don’t know how many people are going to be going out every week. It’s also a trial run for the university to see if it’s going to be successful at reforming social policies.”
The IFC draft selection this week was the result of a discussion between administrators and student leaders looking to reform social events in the school’s official policies.
Sandoval noted how the alcohol and social life forum held last semester was the starting point for discussion and reformation of university social policies.
“The forum really started the conversation about what to adjust in terms of social policies and how to make social life safer at the university,” he said.
Since then, university leaders including Dr. Ainsley Carry, USC’s vice provost for Student Affairs, have crafted new social policies focusing on three subjects: education, enforcement and environment.
The university is also increasing involvement with DPS to ensure enforcement of new social policies as a first step toward reformation of social life at USC.
UPDATE: This post has been updated to show that IFC instituted the revised social policy for The Row.
“According to a new university policy, the Dept. of Public Safety is allowing four chapter houses to host social events each weekend night, a maximum of 12 chapter events per weekend.”
How exactly is it a problem if a private organization wants to hold a private event in a private residence on private property?

Sean Curran, assistant professor in Biogerontology, and Shanshan Pang, postdoctoral fellow, have identified a gene which allow organisms to adapt to dietary changes, according to their published report in Cell Metabolism.

Curran and Pang observed the effects of diet on the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, a millimeter-long worm frequently used as a model organism. The specific gene identified in their study, alh-6, is expressed in a wide range of organisms, ranging from yeast bacteria to humans. Specimens with a mutated alh-6 gene aged prematurely when subjected to a nonstandard diet.
“Although in people we have the same genes, [alh-6], there are small differences, and that’s going to change just slightly how the function works,” Curran said. “I think there’s going to be hundreds more gene-diet pairs to be found. Because [the research] is at the early stages, it’s hard to predict how many there are going to be, or how long it’s going to take.”
Though most students might not necessarily adhere to a strict diet such as veganism or a ketogenic diet, eating to promote good health seems to be a common goal.
“I just subscribe to a balanced diet,” said Maya Barnes, a junior majoring in business administration. “You want to eat proteins and good fats, but that doesn’t mean completely cutting out everything you want to eat.”
Diet can be of particular importance to athletes. It is difficult, however, to empirically gauge the effectiveness of a diet for an individual without going through a process of trial and error.
Zacharie Smith, an undeclared freshman, noted how his commitment to football affects his diet.
“I’m just trying to eat more often throughout the day, eating smaller meals, [eating] fruits and vegetables and trying to stay away from pasta,” he said.
Roberto Yslas, a junior majoring in economics and mathematics and an avid hockey player, echoed Smith’s sentiment.
“I don’t really like the word           ‘diet’ — I prefer the word ‘nutrition,’ Yslas said. “I choose foods that will fuel my body and the good thing is I happen to find that those things taste good too.”
Curran envisions a future in which individuals can be matched together with their optimal diets.
“Instead of having to trial-and-error test a diet, we eventually can just make correlations and clinically test specific genetic backgrounds and specific diets, and see if those combinations work,” Curran said. “Now, we live in an era when you can sequence your genome for a thousand bucks. Once we identify more of these gene and diet pairs, when you’re born, you can have your genome sequenced and — based on the genes — we can find your chance of success on this diet or on that diet.”
Barnes noted that she could see a profitable future for personal diet planning.
“I can see [personalized diet planning] becoming successful, because we’ve seen that different kinds of workouts work better for different people, so it would make sense that people metabolize foods differently and with varying levels of success,” Barnes said.
Curran believes that though pairing individuals with genetically compatible diets could improve longevity or lead to weight loss, the primary goal of diet pairing would be to increase quality of life and promote good health.
“If some scientific method does prove that this is going to be better for your sustenance or growth, I don’t think it could hurt,” said Ashima Sharma, a senior majoring in chemical engineering. “I would diet to promote the best health I can get.”

Director Quentin Tarantino has chosen his next project: a real-life legal drama. And like so many of his blood-splattered protagonists, the director of Kill Bill and Django Unchained wants revenge.
A week after calling Deadline’s Mike Fleming, Jr. to announce that someone in his inner circle had leaked an early draft of his planned ensemble western The Hateful Eight, Tarantino has filed suit against the news and gossip site Gawker for posting links to the screenplay in question. As fans of the writer-director’s ultraviolent opuses continue to debate his decision to shelve the hotly anticipated project for at least five years — although it might be published in script form in the meantime — industry insiders are watching this saga of treachery and vengeance unfold with great interest, particularly as it pertains to creators’ rights, the ability of bloggers to share illegally obtained material and the general state of intellectual copyright law in the digital age.
The debacle, which bears all the hallmarks of a classic drawing room mystery, began after Tarantino entrusted the script to six people, including his regular collaborators Tim Roth and Michael Madsen, current Academy Award-nominee Bruce Dern and Django Unchained producer Reggie Hudlin. The latter allowed an unnamed agent to read the script at his house but was able to prevent its further dissemination. According to Tarantino, another agent, this one representing either Madsen or Dern, is to blame for the leak. Roth, who famously portrayed a police informant in the director’s 1992 debut Reservoir Dogs, was ironically the first to be cleared of suspicion.
Two days after Tarantino reported the leak to Deadline, Gawker published an article with the brazen headline “Here is the Leaked Quentin Tarantino Hateful Eight Script.” The piece, which has received nearly 200,000 hits, contains hyperlinks to a number of anonymous websites that allow readers to download the complete screenplay.
This past Monday, Tarantino’s attorneys Martin Singer and Evan Spiegel retaliated by filing a contributory copyright infringement lawsuit against Gawker Media. The filmmaker’s legal team is also seeking an injunction against the other sites as part of a concerted effort to thwart any further leaks, as well as more than $1 million in unspecified damages. If it goes to court, the case could have significant and far-reaching effects on the nature of intellectual property rights in the 21st century.
So, were Tarantino’s actions justified given the circumstances? Some of the filmmaker’s critics have accused him of orchestrating the controversy as part of some elaborate public relations stunt. Others think the filmmaker simply overreacted, saying that he’s had no problem with leaked scripts in the past, even to the point of praising his fans for seeking them out. They’re presumably referring to the screenplays for Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained, both of which were widely available months before their respective release dates. The difference is that those were final drafts, released when both films were already well into production. The Hateful Eight script, by contrast, was little more than a rough sketch whose main purpose was to inspire creative feedback from a select group of Tarantino’s friends and colleagues.
No matter what your opinion on copyright law is, surely we can agree that it’s unfair to unveil a work in progress without its creator’s knowledge or consent. Imagine if every novel was judged solely by its author’s cluttered outlines or if every painting was immediately appraised by that first tentative brushstroke on canvas. The artistic medium as a whole would suffer and artists would become even more reclusive and temperamental. It would also drain the creative process of its remaining mystique, the life of the mind reduced to the level of a self-conscious celebrity’s Twitter profile.
In the midst of all this scrutiny and speculation, there’s also a lingering sense of loss over the movie that “might have been.” The Hateful Eight sounds as if it had the makings of a typically sensational outing for Tarantino, a virtuoso of viscera with one of the most enviable track records in Hollywood. Prior to the leak, the director was already hard at work promoting the film in interviews, promising audiences a ferocious hybrid of The Magnificent Seven and The Wild Bunch, featuring Bruce Dern in his triumphant return to the western genre more than four decades after shooting John Wayne in the back at the end of 1972’s The Cowboys.
Now viewers are stuck waiting for Tarantino’s next burst of inspiration, although he recently hinted that he’s been developing another project alongside The Hateful Eight. Could it be Killer Crow, the oft-mentioned Basterds tie-in? The increasingly doubtful Kill Bill Vol. 3? That horror movie he keeps promising to make? Whatever it is, don’t be surprised if it involves the messy demise of a loose-lipped Hollywood agent.

On Tuesday evening, USC students and faculty gathered at Ground Zero Performance Café for an Open Mic Night focused on race, culture and identity. The event was an installment of Project ReMix, an interactive discussion series coordinated by Asian Pacific American Student Services, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and El Centro Chicano.
Rhyme time · Judah 1, a slampoet from Pomona, performed a piece about black identity at Ground Zero on Tuesday evening. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
Launched in 2008, Project ReMix teaches multiracial students about how their identities are linked to social justice issues. The program engages participants in a dynamic format, with past events including movie screenings, writing workshops and community discussions.
The Open Mic Night featured spoken word poetry and music by USC students and three local artists: David Romero, Marjorie Light and Judah 1.
Romero, a Chicano poet and alumnus of USC, described a lifelong struggle to define his identity as a Mexican born in the United States. He opened the show with a poem about cheese enchiladas.
“I want a chance to make you all my cheese enchiladas,” Romero said. “And with every bite, with every delectable morsel, I want you to remember that you love Mexicans, that you love Latinos. Or I’ll keep making these cheese enchiladas for you, until you do.”
Azmera Hammouri-Davis, a sophomore majoring in social sciences, recited “Freedom,” a piece she wrote in light of Black History Month.
“Freedom sounds like the voices of the oppressed, finally getting a mic and laying it all to rest,” Davis said. “Freedom looks like justice, sufficient justification for historical abuse of marginalized groups who were born into this society created to keep them down.”
Following Davis, Light performed a manifesto piece entitled “Decolonize Your Mind.” A self-described “Renaissance woman” and “one-woman art festival,” Light is a Filipina musician, writer and DJ from Eagle Rock, Calif.
To create the track for “Decolonize Your Mind,” she mixed Filipino gongs over hip-hop beats.
“I like to take parts of my culture and make them relevant to my life here in the States. That’s what remixing is all about,” Light said.
In her second rap called “Bad A–,” Light embraced her ethnic roots and discussed female empowerment.
“I can sing, rap and dance so naturally. Don’t be mad at me because I got talent and beauty. I create my own empire, run my own show,” Light said.
She continued with confidence, stating, “Yeah I’m kind of a bada–, queen of the neighborhood … Is it any wonder, you really surprised, that a girl like me would step up tonight?”
Judah 1, a slam poet, author and teacher from Pomona, covered a wide range of topics relating to black culture and identity.
“My people perish for a lack of knowledge, under educated on purpose. Now ignorance spreads corruption, now n—-rs they call themselves, truly they have forgotten themselves,” he said.
Romero, Light and Judah 1 each brought a distinct flare to the show, and embracing ethnicity and cultural traditions were consistent themes throughout their performances.
To conclude the evening, audience members stepped up to the stage for an open mic session.
Hassan Romieh, a freshman majoring in business administration, performed for the first time in front of an audience. He took advantage of the opportunity to break out of his comfort zone.
“I usually don’t do stuff like this,” Romieh said, “I’m a spring admit, so I’m trying to turn a new leaf. I’m really glad I did it. Otherwise I would’ve regretted it.”
Miranda Freeman, an undeclared freshman, valued the broad span of topics covered.
“I really enjoyed the performances,” Freeman said, “I liked that there was a variety of poems about love, war, cultural diversity and race. Everyone brought their own style.”
Jennifer Sunmonu, a visiting student from Duke University, appreciated the inclusive nature of the show.
“The poems hit on all the social issues. They weren’t geared just toward blacks or Hispanics, which I thought was great,” Sunmonu said.
Project ReMix has several events on its spring semester calendar.
In February, the program will host a screening of An Ordinary Hero: The True Story of Joan Mulholland and a Q&A session with the star of the film.

Pulling up to Food Haus Café, the traditional American-style café new to South Olive Street, one might wonder if this is the right spot. Wedged in the middle of what feels like the industrial part of downtown and the furthest thing from a bustling strip of restaurants, its neon letters glow between little else.
Don’t be a pesto · The restaurant’s “Pesto Margarite” (featured above), is sure to please any crowd with thin crust, tomatoes and shallow layer of pesto sauce. This appetizer is sure to be a great start to any meal. – Grace Goodrich | Daily Trojan
 
A few men and women sit outside sorting receipts and greet you as you walk in — are they the owners? It’s empty, with a cash register at the front and a stack of menus in a box — do you seat yourself? (You do). Do you order by the register? (You do).
What is this place?
But the initial uncertainty diminishes after taking in the variety of choices that the Mexican and Italian-infused menu has to offer, complete with quirky names like “Heart Attack Pancakes” or “Roll the Dice” with the chef’s choice. And don’t forget the influence of L.A. cuisine, with dishes called the “I Run LA” omelet or “West Hollywood” bagel. In addition to omelets and bagels, items for the morning include breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches, while lunch and dinner range from salads and sandwiches to burgers, melts and flatbreads. And by the time the food comes, any previous uncertainty has entirely dissipated.
With a soft opening on Jan. 24, the restaurant has already developed a reputation for their “After Hours Torta”: New York steak, tomatoes, lettuce, avocado and mozzarella, slathered with a black bean spread and drizzled with ranchero sauce and garlic lime aioli. With one bite, it’s easy to see why.
The meat, while plain and not heavy on seasonings, proves tender and not overly chewy. The Italian loaf is soft and warm, and they don’t skimp on the avocado — something difficult to come by even at most sandwich shops. A healthy serving of French fries, which are like a gourmet version of McDonald’s but slimmer and with basil, comes with chipotle aioli sauce on the side. Each component of the meal complements the other. A bite of the sandwich, a bite of fries, and then another of the sandwich, and back and forth until only the sauce is left, dripping down the side of the napkin.
Another crowd-pleaser is the “Mrs. Caesar” salad, for those looking for a slightly healthier, less bread-centered entree. And when they say that it’s kale, avocado and a rosemary bagel crouton, they really mean that that’s all there is. Despite the lack of diversity of ingredients in the salad, the greens are still fresh, and the donut-shaped crouton is still crunchy and soaked in olive oil. The salad is drenched in Caesar dressing, but then again, making kale taste good is a feat on its own, one that needs no questioning.
The flatbreads, whether it’s the “Red Light District” with goat cheese, red peppers and zucchini, or the “Laos” with curry chicken and peanuts, are sure to deliver. The “Pesto Margarite” — melted mozzarella, sweet cherry tomatoes, and a barely-there pesto sauce — is an ideal appetizer with its ultra-thin, non-filling crust. Whole cloves of roasted garlic layered the top, which would probably be better off diced.
Despite having mastered quick bites such as pizza and sandwiches, Food Haus Café has yet to prove itself as a fine dining destination. More exotic dishes, such as the coconut shrimp, feel smothered in a too-thick breading, and the flavor of coconut was more of a punch in the face than a subtle tap on the shoulder. The presentation, however, is something out of a magazine or a Hawaiian luau: Shrimp on skewers poke out of a thick slice of pineapple covered in black and white sesame seeds.
Prices are reasonable, especially by Los Angeles’ standards, with appetizers ranging between $3 and $9 and main meals coming in between $8 and $13. Casual touches add character to the new food hub, such as meals being served on newspaper wrapping or cute, Pinterest-inspired mason jars with colorful straws to hold water.
At times, the ambiance is a bit conflicting — the New York City skyline is stenciled on the walls, orchids decorate the tables, black, plastic-like upholstery lines the wall seating and an old-fashioned bicycle hangs awkwardly in one corner. Loud, electronic music blares on the speaker system. Service is polite and to-the-point, except no one seems to be able to suggest anything on the menu except “everything.”
Check out Food Haus Café for simple, cheap eats, but keep in mind, the café closes at an early 8 p.m. This new spot is great if you’re looking for a quality, casual meal without the fluff that might make other restaurants five stars but also three dollar signs.
AMAZING FOOD!

Earlier this month, a student at Purdue University opened fire on campus, fatally wounding a fellow student, according to The New York Times. A mere three days later, a man was charged with shooting a student at South Carolina State University. Despite the frequency of these tragic events, however, the discussion surrounding them is much of the same. Rather than brush off these shootings as common occurrences, society must address the lack of safeguards to prevent these atrocities.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
For the past several years, gun control has been a contentious issue. Recent shootings in Aurora, Colo., Newtown, Conn., Purdue University and now South Carolina State University have shown how the gun control discussion has reached a stasis and that debate must shift from one of abstract ideology to one of substantial change. Gridlock on both sides of the argument has stagnated necessary and rational change.
A common platitude among gun owners is that “Uncle Sam” wants to take guns away. Rally cries of the Second Amendment and Big Brother clamping down on civil liberties have been digressions in the discourse of gun control. The idea that implementing stricter background checks and eliminating loopholes will lead to the end of guns as we know it is a slippery slope. There is no call to eliminate guns altogether, but rather there are calls to institute logical restrictions and protocol that give citizens the right to bear arms while also protecting the population as a whole.
Some assert that restricting gun ownership takes aim at the wrong cause, arguing that “guns do not kill people, people kill people.” This is true. Yet by the same token, cars do not kill people, drunk drivers do, and that is why we have safety measures in place that limit blood alcohol content levels, enforce a drinking age and raise penalties for breaking such laws. The public fully supports such measures because of a shared understanding that these deaths at the hands of drunk drivers can be preventable. Since 1973, drunk-driving and related deaths have dropped two-thirds. If responsible regulations helped prevent deaths on the road, then there is no reason they cannot apply to gun control.
Universities must take steps in order to prevent such atrocities. After the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University shooting in 2007, most campuses across the country adopted alert systems to notify students and faculty of emergencies. Purdue has put such a safeguard in place and should be applauded for its swift reaction to the event — but that alone won’t solve the problem. Rather, universal preventative legislation must be put in place for all universities.
If the 11,419 gun-related deaths last year are not enough of a compelling argument to enact change, then consider the shooting at Purdue. A shooting at a large research university really hits home. If such a tragedy could occur on a college campus such as Purdue, what’s to say it couldn’t strike other campuses?
Restrictions on the sale of ammunition can help prevent frequent shootings. An assault rifles ban would eliminate any and all assault rifles. Why would someone need a weapon that can cause an absurd amount of damage and harm? More frequent and strict background checks can help prevent putting guns in the wrong hands. Loopholes at gun shows and having rifles available online at shooting ranges are among a series of steps that can be taken that will over time help stem the damages of gun violence. As people at  Purdue tragically learned, a lack of basic mechanisms that prevent the presence of guns in locations such as a college campus can result in unnecessary death.
The consequences to public safety caused by guns should not be taken lightly. The Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms for a well-regulated militia. Citizens have the right to own guns, but common sense measures need to be in place that will help prevent deaths and mass carnage.

The law has already addressed school shootings – they are a crime in multiple ways. Which of the recent school shootings were LEGAL and we need a new law to make it illegal? It is said that the Colombine High School killers violated 21 laws in the planning and execution of their attack. Would adding one more law have stopped their plan?  Will adding one more law really make a difference in the numbers of crimes involving guns? We have evidence from the so called Assault Weapons Ban – no net effect. Mass shootings have become so RARE that now any shooting that involves TWO victims is now classified as a MASS shooting?

As Winston Churchill once said, “A politician needs the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year and to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn’t happen.” President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was, as expected, characterized by ambitious proposals. Some of President Obama’s goals for the coming year will succeed and some will not. Hence, an accurate assessment of the president’s speech is largely based on the feasibility of the proposals outlined, and their potential to succeed.
Domestic Policies: B
As expected, a large portion of President Obama’s speech considered the widening gap between the rich and the poor and the assertion that “upward mobility has stalled.” A publication by several economists released last week argued the contrary, proposing that upward mobility, or the ability to advance in income, has not changed by a significant amount in 40 years. Upward mobility is a nice political buzzword, but facts are facts.
The correct way to frame the issue of income inequality would have been to focus less on upward mobility in a broad sense and more on a single proposal about raising the federal minimum wage. Unfortunately, there were several problems with President Obama’s mention of the minimum wage. First, it received relatively little attention compared to how popular it polls (64 percent among independent voters). Second, President Obama didn’t emphasize the need to tie it to the cost of inflation — a component that, as I argued in last week’s column, is essential for the proposal to succeed.
Additionally, the president shifted responsibility to the states and small businesses. But by acknowledging that only five states have raised their minimum wage since he called for it in last year’s State of the Union address, he revealed the extreme limitations of such a demand.
President Obama mentioned the proposal to raise the minimum wage about as often as he mentioned reducing gun violence and passing immigration reform — two proposals that have as much chance of passing as the Seattle Seahawks have of winning the Super Bowl (in my opinion, none). Even worse, President Obama spent more time touting the already-popular pre-existing condition clause than he did chastising the Republicans for trying to repeal the landmark legislation, and spent even more time doing that than he did offering hope for fixing the problems that have plagued the website’s rollout for the last six months.
Foreign Affairs: C  
The most factually dubious and misleading points in the speech came when President Obama made two War on Terror promises that the United States should be tired of hearing; first, “we will be done by the end of this year and our longest war will finally be over,” as well as a call on Congress to “lift restrictions on detainee transfers and close prison at Guantanamo Bay.”
The War in Afghanistan will not end at the conclusion of 2014 because of an agreement between the United States and the government of Afghanistan called the Bilateral Security Agreement. The BSA, which the Obama administration has pressured Afghan President Hamid Karzai to sign, will leave 12 to 14 thousand troops in Afghanistan to train the security forces. It will also allow the CIA to continue using the country as a base for drone strikes in Pakistan and the surrounding areas. It will also mean the continuation of $3 billion worth of military aid to the local security forces. It appears the longest war still has a ways to go.
For the laundry list of policies that President Obama emphasized executive action on in the face of a divided Congress, calling on that body to close Guantanamo and end restrictions on transferring detainees was misleading. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act, the annual spending bill for the military, explicitly gives President Obama the power to take necessary steps to close the prison. First, it clarified existing transfer restrictions, which only apply to moving prisoners to the United States, and second, it renewed a ban on using funds to house the prisoners in the United States. Of the 158 detainees still at Guantanamo, 71 have been cleared for transfer. It is up to President Obama — not Congress -— to send them home.
Working with Congress: A  
President Obama deserves high praise for chiding the most unproductive Congress since World War II. Moreover, he deserves credit for solving the problem of working with Congress by vowing to go around them. From executive education reform to gun control, Obama made explicitly clear that he is both aware of Congress’ limited potential and is willing to fix it. With such great promises, however, comes great responsibility — and followers of Winston Churchill will hope that next year, President Obama will explain why they did happen, and not why they didn’t.

In 2013, the world’s biggest artists created an unexpected amount of innovative, provocative music, often forsaking tried and true formulas. It seems this innovation race is being propelled from the bottom, largely by an extremely talented new crop of female singers.
This group has been able to take hold at a time when the most exciting music tends to transcend genre. What genre, for example, is James Blake, whose most famous song, “Retrograde,” is so compelling because it is so hard to describe?
The lack of genre in last year’s new releases can be seen in upstarts and superstars alike, as evidenced by a wide variety of artists, including Daft Punk, whose album “Random Access Memories” can be described as electronic, funk and disco; and Miley Cyrus, whose record “Bangerz” mixes hip hop and traditional pop elements.
The increased “genrelessness” of the music industry is a democratizing force, encouraging women in particular to take on leading roles at higher rates. And nowhere is music more “genreless” or democratic than within the loosely defined classification of indie pop. Rather than being a genre in the traditional sense, indie pop can best be described as sounds that tend to appeal to millennials. It includes elements of traditional pop, rock, folk, electronic and dance, among many other musical styles.
When genres were more restrictive, there was less room for women to take more substantive and creative roles in music making. Rock and hip hop, two of the most popular genres of the modern era, were almost exclusive boys clubs, with a few notable exceptions, like Lauryn Hill and Grace Slick. Pop, on the other hand, has featured many successful female singers, but usually forces them to conform to strict musical formulas and a hyper-sexualized aesthetic. The “genrelessness” of contemporary music, and indie pop in particular, has allowed women to be more experimental in their work, yielding the most artistically interesting crop of female artists popular music has ever seen.
The mainstream began to feel the ubiquity of women in indie pop in 2013. Lorde was one of the most commercially successful indie pop artists this year, male or female, overshadowing Vampire Weekend, while critical darlings Sky Ferreira and CHVRCHES dominated music blogs. Lesser-known indie pop acts featuring female singers like MS MR, Quadron, and BANKS released fascinating music last year, and will certainly be worth watching in 2014 and beyond.
The demographic trends occurring in indie pop are beginning to be reflected in other genres as well. Singers like Janelle Monáe and HAIM, who can best be described as soul and rock, respectively, released some of the most original music of the year. The quality of music these women are producing is the engine that will force established artists, particularly the sorority of pop chanteuses that seem to have a monopoly on the genre, to come up with better music in 2014. We’ve already seen it with Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse” and Lady Gaga’s “Do What U Want.” Although this year’s most highly anticipated indie pop new releases are from male groups fun. and Foster the People, don’t be surprised if another Lorde single blindsides the competition.
It feels good to attribute the increasing role of women in music’s progress machine to improved gender equality, but perhaps there’s more to it. The trend also raises the question, is there something about the female voice that defines the moment in which we live?
