This past weekend kicked off the NFL season and USC’s numerous rookie alums got their first taste of the NFL’s intensity in the regular season. This new class of Trojans looks to make an impact in the pros like many USC classes before them.
Sam Darnold
The New York Jets’ quarterback battle is over, with Darnold as the resounding winner. His performance throughout the preseason and training camp has impressed the staff — so much so that the team traded away Teddy Bridgewater. In his first game, the gunslinger did not disappoint, living up to his preseason hype. After an unfortunate start to the game where he threw a pick-six, he turned things around by throwing for almost 200 yards and two touchdowns, leading the team to a 48-17 win over the Detroit Lions. The Jets had a balanced game plan and running backs Bilal Powell and Isaiah Crowell garnered 162 yards and two touchdowns combined. The defense also stepped up and forced five turnovers, making life easier for Darnold. 
Already being hailed as the Jets’ savior, Darnold hopes to elevate the team back to 2009-10 levels where a strong defense and ground game bolstered Mark Sanchez, another former Trojan, to the AFC championship game. Expectations are high for the young quarterback as he becomes the face of a Jets franchise characterized by disappointment in recent years.
Rasheem Green
After an impressive preseason with three sacks at the Seattle Seahawks, Green was stuck behind defensive tackle Quinton Jefferson in the depth chart. While he did not play much in Week 1, he is expected to see an uptick in snaps as the season goes on and Seattle looks to rebuild its defense. 
Once feared throughout the league, Seattle’s defense, formerly known as the Legion of Boom, has seen its ranks depleted of the superstars who elevated the team to a Super Bowl championship. Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Brandon Browner, Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril have all since departed, and stud Earl Thomas is likely to follow due to contractual issues. Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, who led USC to multiple national championships, built his vicious defenses by developing young talent, like Green, in the later rounds of the draft. Overshadowed by the performance of inspirational rookie Shaquem Griffin, Green aims to make more of an impact in next week’s game against the Bears.
Uchenna Nwosu
In spite of injuries to the Los Angeles Chargers’ front seven, including Joey Bosa, one of the league’s best young defensive players, Uchenna Nwosu received only two defensive snaps against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 1. Like Green, an impressive preseason did not seem to translate into production in the regular season opener. The Chiefs sliced up the Chargers’ defense, scoring 38 points. The coaching staff could have given more playing time to one of the team’s most consistent athletes and pass rushers in Nwosu. 
Ronald Jones II
Jones’ season has been off to a shaky start in Tampa Bay. Struggling in training camp and in the preseason, Jones’ regular season debut was postponed after he was a healthy scratch for the season opener. The young back hopes to turn things around as he still remains one of the most explosive players to come out of the draft. The Tampa backfield is anything but crowded, but Jones will still have to prove himself if he hopes to surpass Peyton Barber and Jacquizz Rodgers in the depth chart.
Deontay Burnett     
The Jets signed free agent receiver Deontay Burnett, who fought valiantly for a spot on the roster. Only 20 years old, Burnett, who was Sam Darnold’s favorite target last year, has battled to overcome his diminutive build and make the team’s practice squad. Burnett has a lean physique, even for a slot receiver, but integration into an NFL training regimen could build the very young receiver into a more prototypical NFL wide receiver.
Steven Mitchell
 Mitchell, another underrated free agent with a diminutive frame at 5-foot-10, made the Rams’ practice squad. The Rams lack receiving depth behind pro bowler Brandin Cooks and breakout candidates Cooper Kupp and fellow Trojan Robert Woods, so Mitchell could join the 53-man roster in the case of an injury.

Freshman quarterback JT Daniels threw two interceptions and zero touchdowns against Stanford, but he will look to turn the page against Texas this weekend on the road. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
After a tough loss at Stanford on Saturday, the Trojans will attempt to redeem themselves when they travel to the Lone Star State to play Texas with preparations ramping up on Tuesday.
Prized freshman quarterback JT Daniels struggled against the Cardinal, completing 16 of his 34 passes for 215 yards and two interceptions while getting sacked four times and losing a fumble against Stanford’s aggressive blitz. Daniels also briefly exited the game after bruising his hand, causing some concern about his status this week.
But during practice Tuesday, head coach Clay Helton said that Daniels looked good with his hand and is not experiencing pain.
“It’s pretty dang close,” Daniels said when asked if his hand was 100 percent . “It’s just an adjustment I have to make… It’s not like, ‘Oh, I can’t throw to the corner route, or something like that. It was just an in-game adjustment and that’s football and it happens. It’s just something I have to deal with.”  
Daniels also downplayed using his freshman status as an excuse for his play, saying that learning curves are still mistakes.
“They’re both the exact same thing, pretty much,” Daniels said. “They’re mistakes that you would expect someone that’s newer to make … We’re allowed to make mistakes, but it’s also you’re allowed to make that mistake once. … We’re learning from [mistakes] and trying to be better each day.”
Daniels also expressed confidence in freshman wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown, saying that his deep ball targeted to St. Brown that was intercepted in the fourth quarter was not St. Brown’s fault.
“It was not a good throw,” Daniels said. “It wasn’t where it was supposed to be — in the end zone, back corner. Obviously losing is never fun, you never go out to lose … I’m happy that we  got that experience under our belt in week one, rather than week 10, week 11.”
Usc – Texas Rivalry
Head coach Clay Helton is ready to move past last weekend and focus on Texas, a team that USC beat in an exciting double-overtime thriller last season.
“Really a special game, I think for both universities and both fanbases,” Helton said. “This has always been a special rivalry, and we look forward to having the opportunity to going down and facing the Longhorns.”
Helton broke down the Longhorns’ offense and emphasized what the team is looking to do to slow them down. Helton said Texas has a balanced offense and praised quarterback Sam Ehlinger.
“I’ve also been impressed with what coach Herman has been doing with Sam as far as his progression from a true freshman last year to a year’s worth of experience,” Helton said. “You see his poise in the pocket; he’s really maturing. He’s got two really good wideouts on the outside in Collin Johnson and Lil’Jordan Humphrey that are very efficient on the deep ball.”
Texas’ offense isn’t as prolific as Stanford’s, so if USC can limit Texas’ explosive plays and force Ehlinger outside of the pocket and throw on the run, they should be in good shape on that side of the field. Come Saturday evening, Daniels and the offense will look to do their part this time.
Injury Update
Redshirt freshman cornerback Isaiah Pola-Mao is out for the game with a shoulder injury. Senior cornerback Isaiah Langley is limited with hip and groin injuries.

Sam Darnold’s first ever NFL snap couldn’t have gone any worse. 
The former USC gunslinger faked a handoff, dropped back, evaded pressure and threw an ill-advised pass across his body for running back Bilal Powell. Detroit Lions cornerback Quandre Diggs jumped the route and snatched the ball, taking the interception 37 yards to the end zone. 
7-0 Lions. 0-1 Darnold. 
On social media, the uproar was fast and furious. 
“I’ll say it again,” Fox Sports personality Skip Bayless tweeted. “Sam Darnold was a try-too-hard turnover machine at USC and, 1st play of his NFL career, pick six. Too bad. Predictable.” 
What Bayless didn’t predict was how Darnold would respond. Instead of sulking over the costly mistake, the third overall pick went to work. 
Following the pick-six, Darnold completed 16 of his next 20 passes and tossed a pair of touchdowns. The Jets’ defense forced five turnovers of their own. New York would win 48-17 — the franchise’s most points scored since 2012, and its most ever on the road. 
In his historic debut, Darnold displayed an uncanny level of mental toughness. He also showed why it’s a bad idea to write off young quarterbacks too early. 
According to NFL Research, the last two quarterbacks to throw pick-sixes on their first career pass attempts were Brett Favre and Jameis Winston. One is a Hall of Famer. The other is currently inactive due to suspension. Darnold’s career could go in a myriad directions, but in the shining bright lights of Monday Night Football, he controlled his own destiny. 
Scouts use metrics like velocity, height, hand-size and arm talent to evaluate quarterbacks. The Bills’ Josh Allen was thrust into the top 10 because of raw throwing power. Seattle’s Russell Wilson fell to the third round because he was too short. 
Darnold falls somewhere in between this madness. Although he possesses the burly body of an NFL quarterback, many deride his footwork, and analysts are skeptical of the unconventional release that bogs down his prototypical arm strength.
He’s not the perfect archetype of an NFL quarterback, but Darnold’s mental fortitude separates him from the pack. It’s the same characteristic that enabled him to mount a 14-point fourth quarter comeback in the 2017 Rose Bowl and lead a game-tying drive against Texas with under a minute left. He has the it factor. 
“I could sit here and tell you we planned it that way so he could get the jitters out,” said Jets head coach Todd Bowles about Darnold’s first career pass. “But we didn’t.”
On the field, Darnold’s play is either exhilarating or exasperating. For every mind-boggling interception, he’ll deliver a dazzling dime — like the 41-yard touchdown bomb he threw to Robby Anderson in the first quarter. But whatever happens on the field, he remains mentally unshakable. That bodes well for a long NFL career — more so than any 40-time or passing drill. 
“It is what it is,” said Darnold, in typical laid-back fashion, of his opening mistake. “[You] put it behind you and play the game, so that’s really what I did. And I thought the whole team responded really well.”  
Here are two things I enjoyed in the NFL’s opening week:
Fitz Magic 
Journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick started for the Buccaneers on Sunday, in the wake of Winston’s three-game suspension. No one expected the 35-year-old to lead Tampa Bay to a win over New Orleans. The Buccaneers entered the Big Easy as 10-point underdogs. 
But Fitz Magic arrives when you least expect it. He torched the supposedly stout Saints’ defense for a career-high 417 passing yards and four total touchdowns. Tampa Bay won 48-40 in stunning fashion. 
The game served as a friendly reminder to never count out Fitz. He’s experienced a mercurial career, playing for seven teams in 14 years, but he’s always capable of producing a monster game when called upon — as evidenced by his 14 career 300-yard games. 
“I’m never surprised at anything I do,” Fitzpatrick said after the game. 
You beautiful bearded legend. 
0-0-1
The Cleveland Browns did the unthinkable on Sunday: They didn’t lose! 
While a 21-21 tie with Pittsburgh probably wasn’t what they had in mind, I’m excited about this team going forward. Cleveland is loaded with young talent on defense. Second-year defensive end Myles Garrett terrorized the Steelers with two forced fumbles and two sacks, and rookie cornerback Denzel Ward picked off a pair of Ben Roethlisberger passes. 
Shaky quarterback play from the usually reliable, if unspectacular, Tyrod Taylor hampered Cleveland’s chances in the end. 
But with No. 1 overall draft pick Baker Mayfield waiting in the wings, it’s a matter of time before the Browns develop a consistent passing game. 
A win is a win. But for a team with a 1-31 record over the last two seasons, a tie is also a win.

Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier has dominated so far this season with a total of 138 kills and 89 digs. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
The No. 9 Women of Troy had a tough weekend at the Milwaukee Invitational where they took two losses against No. 15 Brigham Young University and host Marquette but ended the tournament  on a strong note with a 3-2 victory over Syracuse. 
USC opened up the weekend with a Friday morning match against BYU. The Cougars swept the Trojans, out-hitting them .287 to .242 and collecting nine aces to USC’s two throughout the match. USC fought hard in the first two matches (28-30, 21-25) before falling in the third set 25-14 despite impressive performances from the Women of Troy outside hitters. 
Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier had a powerhouse performance, boasting a double-double with 13 kills and 15 digs. Junior outside hitter Emily Baptista also recorded 13 kills, along with three blocks and two digs. As the third Trojan to collect 13 kills in the match, sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin added six digs and one block. Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro pieced together the offense with 35 assists and eight digs. 
These shiny numbers weren’t enough to take down a top-ranked team that managed to avoid any errors in the third set. Senior outside hitter Veronica Jones-Perry lead BYU with 26 kills, two blocks and three digs throughout the match, while senior setter Lyndie Haddock-Epich added 34 assists, 11 digs, four kills, three blocks and one ace to seal the win. 
The Women of Troy had to move on from the loss quickly, facing tournament host Marquette that same night. After a hard fought battle, the Trojans fell in a five-set loss. They took the first set, but the Golden Eagles responded by winning two in a row. USC forced a fifth set after a 33-31 fourth-set win but ended up losing 11-15. 
Lázaro made her mark with 46 assists, 16 digs, six blocks, two aces and one kill. Lanier had another double-double with 17 kills and 11 digs, and Botkin delivered once again with 17 kills, six digs, four blocks and an ace. Junior middle blocker Jasmine Gross showed up with 10 blocks and seven kills. The defense was led by senior libero Victoria Garrick’s 21 digs and two aces. 
For the Golden Eagles, Hope Werch recorded 17 kills and 14 digs and junior outside hitter Allie Barber lead with 29 kills. USC led the match in blocks and made less errors, but Marquette’s .286 hitting percentage to the Trojans’ .243 made all the difference. Driven by 71 total assists, their offense was more productive throughout the five sets. 
Coming off of two losses, the Women of Troy walked into their last set against Syracuse on Saturday afternoon, and they took a much-deserved five-set victory. They ended the weekend with a win after starting the match down two sets with close scores (22-25, 25-27) and finishing with three dominant wins in a row to claim the match (25-14, 25-14, 15-13). 
The Trojans found their sense of urgency on offense, starting with Botkin’s career-high 28 kills, nine digs, two blocks and two aces. She finished with a .400 hitting percentage. Gross and Lanier continued to deliver against the Orange, with seven and 18 kills, respectively. Lázaro showed why she is already a two-time Pac-12 Freshman of the Week winner this season with 53 assists, seven digs, six blocks and two aces. Senior defensive specialist Reni Meyer-Whalley added 10 digs to Garrick’s 14 to complete the win. 
On the Orange side of the net, freshman outside hitter Polina Shemanova led the offense with 20 kills and 10 digs. Senior setter Jalissa Trotter had a dominant performance with 35 assists, 11 digs, five kills and three blocks. However these key players weren’t enough to stop the Women of Troy on their determined quest for a victory in the tournament. 
USC will head to San Diego this weekend to take on Louisiana and host San Diego in the SDSU/USD Challenge before returning home next week to open Pac-12 play against UCLA on Sept. 19.

The teen rom-com “Sierra Burgess is a Loser” was released on Friday and stars Noah Centineo and Shannon Purser. (Photo from IMDb)
Netflix is a force in the current movie landscape, ushering in a wave of new romantic comedies this summer and fall. Its summer hits have included  “Set It Up,” featuring Glenn Powell, Zoey Deutsch and Lucy Liu, and the sensational teen romance “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” which stars Lana Candor —  the first Asian-American female lead in a teen romantic comedy — and the charming Noah Centineo, the internet’s latest heartthrob. 
With those successes, “Sierra Burgess is a Loser,” Netflix’s next rom-com venture, has a lot to live up to. The movie  stars not only Centineo as its male lead, but also Shannon Purser (Sierra Burgess), of the critically acclaimed “Stranger Things” franchise. Centineo’s character Jamey is a football player who begins texting Sierra after receiving her number from popular mean girl Veronica (played by Kristine Froseth). And that’s where every aspect of the plot — sense, logic, dignity —  flies out the window. 
 As a studio, Netflix appears to be giving romantic comedies a comeback through its streaming service, especially after the near decade-long slump theaters have received in both ratings and turn-out for this movie genre. The last rom-com to hit No. 1 at the box office prior to 2018 was “Think Like A Man Too” in 2014. The genre’s dry spell has only recently been broken by the summer smash hit “Crazy Rich Asians,” which has defied expectations in the box office, bringing in over $116 million domestically. 
Unlike “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” “Sierra Burgess is a Loser” falls short in quality, compared to the films Netflix has previously released despite solid performances from Centineo and Purser. Both actors showcase  strong emotion, but the movie falls back on typical rom-com tropes that make their performances exceedingly awkward. While teen movies have a tendency to lean toward the absurd, “Sierra Burgess is a Loser” goes beyond that.
Sierra is portrayed as a sensible girl, the underdog of the film: She has a good head on her shoulders and can smartly quote literary text at her father.  Sierra is a generally likeable character, but some of her antics are exaggerated and appear too ridiculous, even as a crazy-in-love teenage protagonist. 
 Jamey and Sierra’s relationship begins when he received her number without her knowledge, and the two strike up a conversation despite the fact that they’ve never met. During this ordeal, Jamey is under the impression that Sierra is Veronica, and Sierra goes along with it.   
Another problematic aspect of the movie is that Sierra pretends to be deaf in a scene so she would not have to speak to Jamey, which would cause her to reveal her voice. Deaf activist Nyle DiMarco and movie critics have criticized the thoughtless message Sierra’s action sends to audiences.
While the movie tries to appeal to  the old adage of “being yourself,” the script reduces the plot to something cheesy and borderline frustrating. 
Romantic comedies are generally predictable: There is always a happy ending. While Centineo is a likable, attractive actor and  Purser is naturally endearing with great acting potential, their characters are hard to connect with. “Sierra Burgess is a Loser” might not have been a show-stopping hit, but Purser has surely solidified herself in the industry as a steady talent.

The ninth season of the Chicago-based Showtime series “Shameless,” starring Golden Globe nominee Emmy Rossum and Emmy award winner William H. Macy, premiered on Sept. 9. (Photo courtesy of Ana Maria Da Veiga)
Based on the British series of the same name, Showtime’s “Shameless” has now been on the air for nearly a decade. The turbulent series has always been notorious for its inconsistency in maintaining compelling, believable storylines, but its early seasons established a balance of comedy and drama that produced moments interesting enough for viewers to overlook its flaws. In its ninth season, however, the formulaic structure of the show has become exhaustingly commonplace.
After a mostly forgettable and uneven eighth season, season nine of the dramedy opens with a storyline seen in several other episodes before, by checking in with each member of the Gallagher family. Lip continues to provide shelter to a young girl while working on his sobriety; Debbie carries on with her job as a welder; Carl pursues a career in military school; Frank continues his sexual and sneaky antics with other PTA moms at Liam’s school; Ian remains in prison; and Fiona works to bail him out — a goal her latest boyfriend Ford has trouble supporting. 
The worst aspect of the premiere is the constant reminder of what “Shameless” was at its peak. In the show’s early years, the characters were incredibly well-developed, and their heartbreak was palpable. Now, they’ve become caricatures of their former selves, failing to connect with the audience as they once did.
Once a gifted student at a prestigious university, Lip’s storyline has been written into the ground. His arcs now feature the pursuit of one girl after another, each less interesting than the last. Similarly, Debbie’s snarky attitude and irritating nature threatens what could be a profound narrative about discrimination in the workplace. Carl, played by Ethan Cutkosky, was much more convincing as a delinquent than a military man. Ian was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several seasons ago, but the disease has never felt more exploitative than in this premiere. His storyline is unintentionally ill-developed and his illness satirizes the  issue of mental health in prisons across America. As she works to bail him out, Fiona has become a sterilized version of her former self. Her vast mood swings are now stale, as the character has shown little to no growth in recent years.
The only slightly stimulating storyline of the episode was that of the Gallagher patriarch, Frank. The premiere shows Frank continuing old habits — namely, having sex with surburban moms from Liam’s prestigious private school — but his undeniable charisma makes his actions passable. Later, Frank attends a PTA meeting where the group is notified they tested positive for three separate sexually transmitted infections, and what follows is the hilarious destruction of each seemingly perfect couple. The episode shows Frank once again utilizing his quick wit and hilarious antics to get out of trouble.
While some storylines throughout the episode were more compelling than others, the season premiere lacked a thematic cohesiveness and narrative focus. It is difficult to tell what direction the season will take, leading to the assumption that season nine will be a more character driven. This approach has been the case in past years; however, better stories will have to unfold for each member of the Gallagher clan if “Shameless” wants to retain the interest of its audience.

Ground Zero hosts their Open Mic Night every Monday evening at 9 p.m. Performances range from musical acts, like that of Valterallen’s, to stand-up comedy and spoken word poetry. Anyone interested is allowed to participate in the weekly event. (Yuwei Xi | Daily Trojan)
Black walls, dark furniture, dim lights, slow snaps: On first impression, Ground Zero’s Open Mic Night is intimidating, but that feeling quickly fades away as a playlist of familiar songs begin to fill the room. 
Songs like Travis Scott’s “Stargazing” helped destroy whatever preconceived notions the audience had of a stereotypical open mic night, creating a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for those in the crowd and on stage. 
Every Monday night, Ground Zero’s Open Mic Night serves as a creative testing ground, providing a safe space for entertainers in all fields to gauge new ideas on live listeners. Those willing to sign up and step on stage took advantage of the venue’s accepting atmosphere, debuting new songs and showcasing their talents to their peers. Members of the audience were treated to artist originals, covers of popular songs, standup comedy and a vast array of acoustic performances. One fan of the event described the sets as “feeling like experienced professionals.” 
El Salvador ’93, a Ground Zero regular of two years, adrenalized the crowd with an unmatchable energy during his three-song set. Alex Kantu was next and decided to “test out” a new song that left listeners with the coveted stank face: A known expression used throughout the rap community that explains the natural look of disgust that takes over a person’s face as they hear a well-delivered set of lines. 
The next performer was one of the two non-musical acts of the night, choosing to use her time to provide a comedic narrative on the hardships that accompany listening to NPR on her way to work. The other comic of the night touched on an assortment of diverse points; with topics ranging from a five- and 10 second rundown of his German and Jewish history to his previous dominatrix relationship, the second comedic act of the night received his fair share of laughs and gasps from those in attendance. Coming in as one of the few stated nonresidential performances of the night, South Jersey’s Pishon Soul Fusion carried out his first L.A. show, covering a number of classics and promising to release originals in the near future. 
The standouts of the talent-filled night came in the form of musicians Valterallen, Yafeu Tyhimba and USC freshman Kyle Tolbert. All three debuted unreleased songs and covered popular artists and bands like Frank Ocean and Twenty One Pilots. 
Valterallen summed up the night, stating, “It’s about coming up and expressing ourselves. We all need that.” 
Tolbert, a freshman majoring in popular music and songwriting,  received the loudest cheers after his performance featuring an original song titled “Bridges” and a cover of Frank Ocean’s “Nikes.” The South Carolina native gave some advice to those looking to participate in upcoming Open Mic Nights. 
“Be unapologetic and fake it until you make it,” he told the crowd.
Ground Zero’s Open Mic Night is on every Monday night starting at 9 p.m.

Dr. Kelly Greco, the assistant director of outreach and prevention services for USC student Health, sets up for a suicide prevention discussion. The event was cut short because no students showed up. (Julia Rosher | Daily Trojan)
USC Student Health held two open discussions centered on suicide prevention on Monday. These were the only USC-hosted events for National  Suicide Prevention Week, a nationwide effort to raise awareness about suicide. However, the discussion was cut short after no students showed up — not a single seat was filled during both sessions. 
While the lack of attendees may have dampened the intended discussion, professionals still emphasized the need for open forums among students and faculty. 
“The reality [is] that student populations are experiencing seemingly more distress yearly,” said Dr. Robert Mendola, the division’s executive director and division chief for student mental health. “We have to identify what’s going on and how to prevent this trend.” 
The discussion was meant to inform students about a suicide prevention tactic titled “Take 5 to save lives,” which presenters said can take as little as five minutes to implement. The tactic includes educating students on signs of suicide, self-care, awareness and the importance of reaching out to professionals.
The forum was also meant to address the increased risk of suicide among marginalized groups including the LGBTQ community. 
“What we do see is that the [suicide] rates are very high for the LGBTQ community,” said Dr. Kelly Greco, the assistant director of outreach and prevention services. 
Throughout this week, USC will be emphasizing the importance of spreading awareness among peers across social media platforms. There will also be a large focus on encouraging students to participate in an ongoing dialogue that extends far past this week. 
“This is a topic and dialogue that needs to be continuous throughout the year,” Greco said. 
The Engemann Student Health Center has started working with the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit organization that helps evaluate a campus’ needs for mental health services and creates comprehensive systems, programs and policies tailored toward mental health, substance abuse and suicide prevention efforts. By integrating the Jed program onto campus, the health center can pinpoint specific issues to target that are present in the well-being of USC students. 
“Our efforts are increasing because our resources are increasing,” Mendola said while referring to the addition of 10 new therapists to the counseling center’s resources. “By increasing our therapists by 10, we’re not just increasing direct service to students, we’re increasing our availability to engage in programs.” 
An example of a new program the center is offering comes in the form of “Feel Better” workshops, which cover topics on anxiety, resilience and other issues present on campus. The workshops encourage proactive student participation in a safe environment; however, they will only take place during the beginning of the semester. Another resource mentioned was Trojan Care for Trojans, an anonymous request form available to all students if they feel worried about a peer. 
“The undertone of all of this is how do we create a campus driven by a culture of student wellbeing?”  said Paula Swinford, the director of the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion.

Doctoral student Buu Van Nygren is focused on balancing school work with the campaign. He will be traveling between USC and the Navajo Reservation throughout the campaign. (Photo courtesy of Buu Van Nygren)
 When he applied to USC, Buu Van Nygren wanted to convey his desire to effect change through leadership to admissions officers. A doctoral student studying education and organizational leadership at the Rossier School of Education, Nygren was selected by the 70-year-old 2018 Navajo Nation presidential candidate Joe Shirley Jr. to run as his vice president. 
Nygren was exposed to politics in 2010 as an undergraduate student and counselor volunteer at Arizona State University. He became involved with Shirley’s presidential campaign in 2014, when Shirley lost the bid in the general election. Despite the loss, Nygren kept in contact with Shirley and his campaign manager to help the campaign trail over the summer for this year’s election. 
“We helped rallies, we helped meet and greets, we went to flea markets where they sold things, we gave out cards, we gave out information,” Nygren said. “We helped with social media efforts, making sure that [we were] taking photos and keeping things updated on social media.” 
During the campaign, Nygren found it difficult to engage with certain voter groups. According to him, Shirley’s original vice president choice, Peter Deswood III, who became ineligible to hold a Navajo Nation office, represented the Arizona side of the reservation. Traditionally, the vice president selected would be from New Mexico to help engage with a larger voting population. However, because Nygren is from Utah, he is unable to mobilize as big of a supporter base. 
“That was one of my biggest struggles overcoming to make the number one contender was that I wasn’t from New Mexico,” Nygren said. 
People have also expressed concern for Nygren’s qualifications by questioning whether he is “Navajo enough” for the vice president position. 
“One of the big things was people not knowing my name,” Nygren said. “It seems foreign because of my Vietnamese lineage on my dad’s side. The good thing is that in Navajo culture you are who you are through your mother … that’s how I identify myself.” 
Despite his mixed racial background, Nygren is deeply connected with his Navajo heritage. Nygren’s fluency in Navajo allows him to effectively communicate with older voters. At 31, he believes in the importance of representing the voices and interests of younger Navajos in tribal politics. One of Nygren’s goals is to create a mutual respect between the young and old generations of the Navajo people. 
Nygren hopes to continue balancing his campaign work and academics. While studying at USC, the politician will travel between California and the Navajo Reservation to keep up with the demands of being a student and vice presidential candidate. 
Nygren says he hopes to apply the skills he learns at USC to improve tribal politics.
“It’s going to really test my organizational skills, but I think it kind of balances out,” Nygren said. “It’s super exciting. I feel like there’s a big movement for young people to be in political offices … I think it’s cool to kind of be a part of that movement even thinking about being the vice president of the largest tribe in the country.”

Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo made a stop in Los Angeles on her way to San Francisco for the C40 Summit, a network that brings together more than 90 of the world’s largest cities in an effort to address and combat climate change. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
When the city of Los Angeles presented USC with the chance to have a conversation with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, the USC Center on Public Diplomacy jumped at the opportunity on Monday and invited 20 students to have a roundtable discussion. 
The center, a collaboration between the School of International Relations and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, seeks to involve students in a discussion of cultural relations and global involvement. 
The roundtable comprised both graduate and undergraduate students, whose majors and concentrations included engineering, economics, public policy, journalism and French.
Hidalgo and her team are visiting Los Angeles to meet with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to discuss both Los Angeles and Paris’ goals for the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympic Games — with an emphasis on urban sustainability and efficiency.
“I am very happy to be here because Los Angeles is a wonderful city and this university is very famous, of course,” Hidalgo said upon arriving to the event. “I am here, especially, to share with you [my] experiences. Between L.A. and Paris, have a very strong relationship.”
Between 2015 and 2017, Los Angeles and Paris competed to host the 2024 Olympic Games. In September 2017, the International Olympic Committee voted to simultaneously award Paris and Los Angeles the 2024 and 2028 games, respectively. 
“We have been building a strategy between Paris and L.A. [for the] Olympic Games, and now we are working together not just on [the games], but also about the transformation of our cities,”  Hidalgo said. “We will work on climate change and what our cities can do, because we have to fight against pollution.” 
After her short visit to Los Angeles, Hidalgo will be traveling to San Francisco for the C40 Summit. C40 is a network that brings together more than 90 of the world’s largest cities in an effort to address and combat climate change. 
Hidalgo, the first woman to be elected mayor of Paris and former co-host of the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, now serves as Chair of the C40. Garcetti serves as the vice president. 
“Tomorrow, we are going to San Francisco for the summit on climate change with Governor Jerry Brown, Mike Bloomberg and 30 mayors [from] all over the world,” Hidalgo said. “[Our goal] is to convince people that we have the solutions and that these solutions can create new opportunities [for jobs] …  “We can have in the same view economy, ecology, and health.” 
Hidalgo wants to focus much of Paris’ Olympic preparation on transforming the city.  
“[Paris] can build strategies and alliances with other cities and even the private sector,” she said. “We are [at] the forefront of all that is changing, and we have to build solutions for new problems.” 
Paris Deputy Mayor Jean-Louis Missika, who spearheads the city’s initiatives in innovation and architecture, attended the meeting as well. He oversees a program that encourages worldwide competition among cities to create architecture solutions that are zero waste and zero emissions. 
“Cities are discussing … regulations, norms and strategies in order to have more clean industries …” Missika said. “This is the challenge of the next five years. It’s not a question of the long future. It’s tomorrow.” 
Students had the chance to direct questions to the mayor, all of which ranged from Paris’ treatment of refugees to the C40’s developing nations assistance.
Kelechi Emetuche, a public diplomacy progressive masters student, questioned Paris’ motivation for wanting to host the games.
“In 2015 when I decided to do this campaign [for the Olympics], one [motivator] was the attacks,” Hidalgo said. 
In November 2015, Paris endured multiple terrorist attacks carried out by ISIS. To recover, the Paris community hoped to, “include young people in positive projects and for me, the Olympic games are an [example of] optimism.” 
Hidalgo also discussed how the Olympics would transform northern Paris, an impoverished region, and create more economic opportunity for its residents. 
Though the event was brief due to Hidalgo’s schedule, she encouraged students to be problem-solvers. 
“You young people have to see what the problems of [your] cities are, and you need to find solutions to them,” she said.

In addition to Saturday night’s screening and panel, the School of Cinematic Arts has some of the film’s iconic props and affiliated items on display.

When the 1998 film “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” was released, it received a one-star review from film critic Roger Ebert. It currently holds a “rotten” score of 49 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a 41 percent on MetaCritic. It was a flop with both audiences and critics when it first premiered, but has achieved a cult following because of its enduring themes 20 years later, as every new generation rediscovers it.
 Its wild characters, escapist style and relatable journey of chasing the American Dream transcend space and time to capture the mind of the current generation of moviegoers now two decades since its initial release. In this instance, it was hordes of college students and faculty who looked to the film to indulge their vices vicariously through the legendary picture.
Longtime fans and first-time viewers alike filled the Norris Theater on Saturday to screen this psychedelic trip of a film. The evening was filled with laughter, applause and the thrill of freedom the film exudes. As producer Laila Nabulsi mentioned in the Q&A following the film, these elements are what make “Fear and Loathing” appealing to so many college students gaining their first tastes of independence. 
“It’s a time when you’re breaking free from constraints, and there is something about that that [‘Fear and Loathing’] speaks to: finding your own voice, finding your own way,” Nabulsi told the audience, later referring to experiencing the film as a “rite of passage for young people.” 
The film is based on the 1971 novel by former Rolling Stone journalist Hunter Thompson. The story comes from the bizarre experiences of Thompson and his attorney Oscar Acosta — portrayed as Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro), respectively — as they travel to Las Vegas with a trunk full of, as Duke puts it, “every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 A.D.” Directed by Terry Gilliam, the film gradually gained a massive cult following once its audience and critics slowly came to understand the hidden genius underlying the seemingly nonsensical depictions of Duke and Gonzo’s prolonged drug haze. 
Gilliam, along with cinematographer Nicola Pecorini, who also participated in the Q&A, fashioned a psychedelic style and structure to transport audiences inside the trippy minds of these two men. With regard to the film’s cinematography, Pecorini said he and Gilliam worked hard to “visually transfer every drug,” even positioning the camera at different angles depending on the substance the characters were presently under the influence of. This style was executed carefully in order to create the exact visual perception that Gilliam intended to produce.
In writing, acting and cinematography, the film broke nearly every conventional filmmaking rule, most evidently in its lack of a clear structure. However, Nabulsi said, “You have an interior monologue that shows these people are smart and the pain they’re in is about the world they live in.” Lest the characters become little more than one-dimensional druggies, she commented that the voice-over narration combined with Depp and del Toro’s visceral performances give the characters the depth they deserve. 
“I joke that I took two heartthrobs and made one bald and the other fat,” Nabulsi said of Depp and del Toro. 
Nevertheless, she said they were perfect for the film. She recalled her first encounter with Depp when she immediately knew there was no one else who could play Thompson or Duke. She said she felt Thompson’s essence even as Depp approached the set from a distance. 
“[Depp] had that depth that other actors might miss … There’s an essence of [Thompson] that comes through. I’ve never experienced that: getting the essence as opposed to just the physicality,” Nabulsi said of Depp’s performance. 
Both Nabulsi and Pecorini lamented the loss of passion for the craft of filmmaking over the last 20 years. 
“I’m not in love with making movies anymore as much as I was because it became a weird world,” Pecorini said. “Producers once used to come out of film schools, now they come out of business schools … they don’t know movies and they don’t love movies.” 
As the screening ended, the filmmakers recalled how Gilliam constantly feared Thompson’s judgment as he was adapting the novel into a screenplay. Apparently, when Thompson saw the finished product for the first time, his response was, “I can’t believe you made a good movie out of my mess.” 
Twenty years later, this alleged “mess” was enough to fill a theater once again, and it will undoubtedly fill theaters and midnight movie screenings  for many years to come.

Yasmin Davis | Daily Trojan
Of the millions of faces and bodies in New York City, only one is omnipresent. As a ghost, sculpted out of marble, cast in bronze or chiseled from copper, her gaze follows you across the city. Nameless and timelessly beautiful, she stands afront the New York Public Library, inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, guarding the Manhattan Bridge and perched atop the Municipal Building as the largest statue of a woman in the city after Lady Liberty. 
Her name was Audrey Munson. For decades after gracing Gilded Age New York as an artist’s model and muse, she was forgotten by history. Once lauded as the American Venus for her classically perfect figure and bravery to bare it in the name of art, she was eventually committed to an insane asylum and died unknown in 1996 at the age of 104. According to investigative reporter and author of her biography (“The Curse of Beauty”) James Bone, she was simultaneously America’s first supermodel and Hollywood’s first flameout case. 
At the zenith of her career, Munson was praised for her ideal “Grecian” proportions, rendering her popular among neoclassicist sculptors. Her very appearance, paired with her willingness to brand herself as a sex symbol, inspired and launched many Beaux Arts-style sculptors and avant-garde painters. In his book, Bone reports that she is the “jeune fille américaine” referenced in one of Francis Picabia’s now-infamous paintings. 
I first came across the name Audrey Munson through my work in digital content production at the Getty Research Institute this past summer and instantly became enamored with her story — or lack thereof. I found that Munson’s legacy is largely contingent upon the male artists whose works immortalized her likeness; in fact, her Wikipedia page is little more than a list of men for whom she posed and where their sculptures are mounted today. 
For decades, she was billed as a harrowing cautionary tale of the supermodel-turned-nutcase and remembered for the scandals she created — her au naturel modeling, battles with mental health and controversial public image. For a spell a few years back, she gained temporary notoriety as the inspiration for online think pieces, blogs and even a podcast. Yet, she remained a fantasy trope, exploited this time around — not for her beauty and femininity, but for her unwarranted omission from public memory. 
In reality, Munson was essential to the artists’ creative processes and actively determined the themes and emotions evoked in their art through her poses. It was her dramatic flair and artistic sensitivity that set Munson apart from other figure posers and made her one of the most sought-after nude models.
Though you won’t find her name in any feminist theory texts, Munson was also a proto-feminist in her day. Not only was she unapologetic in her nudity, but she also refused to wear corsets and high heels in her daily life. When she appeared in American cinema’s first non-pornographic nude scene, she became a pioneer in her confrontation of national prudishness. 
“That which is the immodesty of other women has been my virtue…” she said. 
The barriers women are still pushing against today were broken and spotlighted by Munson nearly a century ago; she authored a series of essays that critically examined the role of the model in the artistic process and called out the sexism and salary discrepancies she observed in the 1900s art world.
In 1922, Munson rebuffed sexual advances from a Broadway producer who promptly closed the play she was cast in — an incident bearing striking similarity to stories emerging from the #MeToo movement. From then on and without explanation, Munson struggled to find work and both her career and mental health deteriorated. By age 40, she was admitted to asylum and her narrative became forever tainted. 
For someone who did so much for the advancement of the arts industry and for women’s liberation, Munson’s ultimate anonymity is endlessly dispiriting. She lived a life of glamour and admiration, but her fall from grace was so absolute she was virtually erased, buried in an unmarked grave at the end of her natural life. 
Her story is a tragedy of circumstance; she embraced her own sexuality long before it was acceptable and history punished her for it.  She lived a life representative of all the challenges women who are sexually free and untraditional face from society, but decades before these issues were topical or assimilated into popular discourse. 
I imagine much of her life and career was lonely and distressing, plagued with endless sexist obstacles and devoid of support due to perceptions that her “promiscuity” was sinful. Her likeness may be littered across the country but it took nearly 100 years of gradual cultural shifts for us to be able to rediscover, discuss and regard her as a woman of audacity and valor rather than a self-aggrandizing object of physical perfection.
The most haunting part about Munson’s legacy is how swiftly and easily she was forgotten. According to Bone, a Gypsy fortune teller prophesied when Munson was a girl: “You shall be beloved and famous. But when you think that happiness is yours, its Dead Sea fruit shall turn to ashes in your mouth.” She lived her life by these words, which proved eerily true in the end. 
We weren’t ready for someone like her when she was alive, someone so daring and unrepentant that shock and affront were the primary reactions she drew. But now, her story must be retold and Audrey Munson deserves to be a household name — finally a fitting destiny for the woman rendered across the United States in marble and gold.

The South Korean boy band performed to four sold out shows at Staples Center last weekend for their “Love Yourself” tour. (Photo from Instagram)
From Wednesday to Sunday, Staples Center was filled with glowing ARMY Bombs, dancing fans and the magnetic music of seven men who had traveled all the way from South Korea.
Thursday was the second night in Los Angeles for BTS, the Korean boy band that sold out three shows at Staples Center and later added another due to high demand. Fans — also known as “Adorable M.C. for Youth” or ARMY — with general admission tickets waited as early as the day before to start lining up for entry. Such is the power of BTS.
In 2018, the group released two albums that topped the Billboard charts, shared a music video that become the fastest to reach 100 million views on YouTube and sold out all North American shows on their BTS World Tour: Love Yourself. 
The tour was named after the group’s “Love Yourself” album series. The trilogy follows a singular story arc in which the boys finally reach an epiphany about the importance of self-love.
Even before the boys came on stage, BTS ARMY were practicing fanchants along with music videos playing on screen; every time a new video played, they screamed so loud it seemed like the real show had begun. Between syncing up their ARMY “bombs” — glowing light sticks set to change colors with the music — and starting a wave around the stadium, fans created their own atmosphere of anticipation as they waited for BTS to take the stage. 
When the lights shut off, the crowd held its breath before shouts of joy emerged as one screen lit up and began to move. The sensual, energetic opening notes of “Idol” played right before the spotlight fell on the pop sensations and the show began. 
BTS’ choreography, lyrics and presence worked in tandem to captivate the crowd. Seeing a music video performed in real life is something unique to K-pop and, for many fans, BTS embodies the best of the best. 
“Magic Shop,” a song written for the fans, echoed a sweet message throughout the arena: “You gave me the best of me, so you’ll give you the best of you.” 
The boys then launched into a sequence of solo songs, each showing off his individual talents. J-Hope, who released a solo album this year, performed “Trivia: Just Dance” and showed off his skilled dance moves before the youngest member, Jungkook, took the stage with “Euphoria,” effortlessly hitting all the high notes.
Later in the night, Jimin performed the sweet song “Serendipity” with sensual dance moves, bringing new meaning to his gentle crooning: “Just let me love you.”  When band frontman and songwriter RM performed his wordplay-filled solo “Trivia: Love,” he had the whole stadium chanting after him: “Saram, saram, saram” (people, people, people) and “Sarang, sarang, sarang” (love, love, love). 
The audience went wild when BTS performed a medley of classic tracks including “Boyz with Fun,” “Attack on Bangtan,” “Fire,” “Silver Spoon” and “Dope.” Despite its short five years, BTS has an extensive discography. The group in turn rotated the songs each night of its L.A. performances to keep fans on their toes.
Vocalist V reenacted the music video for “Singularity” — bodiless masks, cloaked backup dancers and all — after a breathtaking concept video, in which he posed somberly in a mauve-colored set, a glass box and a field of roses. 
In “Trivia: Seesaw,” rapper Suga showed off his vocals and dance moves in a rare solo performance, and vocalist Jin closed the solos with the powerful ballad “Epiphany” performed on the piano.
All the vocalists — Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook — came together to sing “The Truth Untold,” another emotional ballad. The rendition saw the boys standing on raised platforms without accompanying choreography, their vulnerable expressions projected onto a jumbo screen.
Right after, the rap line, comprising RM, Suga and J-Hope, transformed the room with an energetic performance of “Outro: Tear,” an intense rap song that had the audience as energized as the boys were on stage.
After several elaborate costume changes — from fringe to lace to sparkles — the boys settled into plain black tour shirts with “Love Yourself” printed on the backs for their three-song encore of “So What,” “Anpanman” and “Answer: Love Myself.” 
BTS has proven to the world that music transcends language and geographic barriers. The members’ personalities, music and success story have captivated millions across the world. Ultimately, BTS’ live performances only strengthen the love, adoration and admiration fans already have for them.

“Diversity” is a word that gets thrown around daily without anyone stopping to think about what it really means. Employers want diverse workplaces, colleges want diverse applicants, and now the University of California school system insists on “diverse professors.” American culture is infatuated with diversity, but for all the wrong reasons. 
Following in the footsteps of five other UC campuses, UCLA announced this month that it will require all prospective professors and all those seeking a promotion to “document their contribution to diversity” in an attempt to hire more diverse faculty.
There are significantly more white than African American and Latinx professors on UC campuses; the same is true for heterosexuals compared to members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, there is a significant area in which UC schools are not diverse — political ideology. According to a 2016 study by Econ Journal Watch, UC schools have a liberal to conservative faculty ratio of 12:1, despite touting other forms of diversity. College professors must educate students holistically and multi dimensionally. To effectively accomplish this, professors should embody a diversity of ideas and opinions.
If a university is diverse in race, ethnicity and gender but is composed of ideologically analogous professors, I would argue that this is as grave a sin as a college with exclusively white, straight and male professors. Universities are rightfully aiming to diversify their ranks, but ideology should be as important as all other factors.
In an ideal world, college campuses would have both appearance-based and political ideological diversity. But if colleges are striving for diversity based only on its faculty’s ethnic and cultural background without a similar push to hire politically diverse faculty, there’s definitely something wrong. 
Perhaps it’s more important to analyze the “race gap” and compare it to the “ideological gap.” The results show that the gap in diversity of opinion is more worrisome than any gap in skin color. In fact, in looking at the numbers, it is evident that the “conservative gap” is exponentially larger than the “minority gap.” 
In 2015, 6 percent of full-time faculty at U.S. universities were African American, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Compare this number to the 5.2 percent of African American doctorate recipients nationwide that same year and it is apparent why there are so few African American professors is influenced by a small pool of candidates. Full-time professors almost always have the highest degree possible in their field of expertise. Therefore, the composition of the pool of doctoral students is the best predictor for who will be the nation’s future professors. 
Now look at the ideology gap: A Pew study found that the ratio of postgraduates who consider themselves “consistently liberal” and “mostly liberal” compared to their “consistently conservative” and “mostly conservative” counterparts is 5.4 to 2.4. At the professor level, there are 12 liberal professors for every conservative professor. The National Association of Scholars also reports that 39 percent of college campuses have zero Republican professors. 
There is an alarming lack of political diversity among college professors, despite the hiring pipeline not reflecting such a large diversity gap. This may be a larger problem than the lack of minority professors where the hiring market does reflect a large gap.
It’s also important to understand why we strive for diverse campuses and faculty. Encouraging ethnic diversity is a strategy for bringing new perspectives and opinions to the marketplace of ideas. However, the reality is that while colleges look to hire candidates who are racially diverse, they often fail to consider ideological diversity, with their hires still dramatically skewing to the liberal side of the spectrum.
The purpose of college is to challenge students with different viewpoints, to give them the opportunity to doubt their previous opinions and ultimately let them weigh and debate their established ideas against what they disagree with. Only by having an opinion challenged can its holder really know if it is worth anything. If an opinion is repeated in an echo chamber and never attacked, a student would never gain insight into important criticism. Ultimately, it does not matter if an opinion is being challenged by a white professor, a Latinx professor or a heterosexual professor, so long as their challenges are equal in caliber.
Of course, diversity of thought is linked to but not necessarily dependent on race, ethnicity or gender. But if the underlying goal is to bring in diverse ideologies into universities across the nation, it would make more sense to target that core goal and bring in diverse thinkers — particularly in the political realm — with equal attention to the pursuit of hiring more minority professors. After all, conservative professors continue to be a minority on college campuses across the United States. Those numbers don’t lie.
