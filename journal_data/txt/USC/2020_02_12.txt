Based on the eponymous sequel to the original book, Netflix’s “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” is a darling movie that follows Lara Jean (Lana Candor), after she and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), begin dating. But in the “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before’’ post-credits scene, Lara Jean’s younger sister opens the door to a young man carrying flowers and a letter addressed to John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher), and we know that the outcomes of the mailed-out love letter are still revealing themselves.
The in-person reunion between Lara and her past crush John doesn’t come until later in “P.S. I Still Love You,” which dropped Wednesday on the streaming platform. There’s a bit of inconsistency, as that part of the story seems to have been omitted entirely. Instead, Lara Jean gets John Ambrose’s letter response in the mail and we actually get to meet him — now replaced by Fisher — later in the film when they coincidentally end up volunteering at the same senior home. But even though it’s rewritten, Lara Jean and John Ambrose’s meeting is just as serendipitous, in perfect teen-romantic comedy fashion. 
In fact, their chance reunion and subsequent work days together are so classically rom-com, you almost want her to end up with him. He’s the sensitive childhood crush who plays piano and writes letters back. Their relationship is filled with cute anecdotes and precious memories that the two shared as kids. But as you fall for their little breakfast-themed Halloween costumes, you can’t help but think, “Is that all John Ambrose McClaren is — a past memory?”
The movie starts off with Lara Jean and Peter’s first date. It’s perfect. In fact, their relationship seems a little too perfect, and the film is well aware of that. It plays on the idea that this whole thing seems too storybook-good to be true. 
But that’s why it works. It doesn’t really try to be anything beyond what it is. This isn’t a great epic of star-crossed lovers battling obstacles to be with one another. It’s two high schoolers trying something new with each other. It doesn’t need to be about high schoolers battling murder and familial betrayal to be together (think a certain CW series). To a high schooler, a new relationship is already that dramatic. 
Sure, the dialogue is a little cheesy, and Lara Jean, in her voiceover, has a tendency to over-explain every detail. But come on, we’re not talking Nicholas Sparks here. 
More telling over showing is forgivable because what they do end up showing is enticing on its own. The color scheme of the film is simultaneously super blue and super warm. Soft pinks and blues, along with Lara Jean’s preppy style and baking hobby are reminiscent of the innocence of girlhood and craving something beyond our years. She’s sweet and young, but she’s also a fully fledged person who has interests and ideas and really deep, really real feelings.
You really feel for her — her desire to be a good girlfriend, her nerves and insecurities around this being her first relationship. Lara Jean makes you feel like a teenager again and you catch yourself not only rooting for the guys she’s falling for but falling for them yourself. 
And part of that is Candor, Centineo and Fisher’s subtle and understated performances. The actors have chemistry, which sincerely conveys the confusion and newness of adolescent love. It helps that they’re not all that much older than their characters (which I guess is a lot to be asking for when it comes to casting these days).
All in all, is “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” going to win any major awards? Definitely not — it’s not a really complex and thought-provoking script. But it’s a charming, tight 81 minutes with a cool indie soundtrack that is sure to make you gush when you watch it with your girlfriends on “Galentine’s Day” this year. Give it a go!

Last semester felt so chaotic. When discussing the Fall 2019 with my friends, we remember nothing but a blur of moving in, tailgating football games we never attended, taking midterms we didn’t have time to study for and getting through all the messy personal drama that filled in the gaps between those. It seems the stress I felt at the time was shared (and, I’ll admit, the retrospective solidarity is nice). 
In the midst of fall’s whirlwind, I fell out of touch with new music. My listening habits fell into a bit of a rut, relying on artists or albums I already knew. Of course, I sought out new music my favorite artists dropped. But when I’m not discovering new artists or genres that excite me with their innovation or novelty, I feel like my music taste is stagnant. So many talented people exist in the world, and I know they’re always out there making new stuff. I was frustrated that I couldn’t find it. Perhaps I just wasn’t doing a good job digging.
Luckily, this semester has been treating me far better. I have a better grip on my personal, artistic and career goals. Music-wise, I’ve experienced a similar upswing: I’ve discovered so many new, incredible artists. I’m excited about music again. And it all started with Rosie Tucker.
I was lost in a hole of Spotify playlists when I stumbled upon one dedicated to indie music: “Fresh Finds: Index.” At the time, Tucker’s song “Ambrosia” was the first song on the list. I pressed play and continued mindlessly scrolling through the app until Tucker started to sing.
Tucker’s singing is strong and smooth, almost ringing like a bell. An electric guitar echoes behind them, Tucker’s voice floating above the even strumming. As the verse turns to the pre-chorus, the melody escalates, growing with tension. When the chorus begins, I feel like I am passing through a tunnel, snapping out of the darkness into a calm, embracing light.
“Ambrosia, dish of the gods,” Tucker sings angelically, describing the dessert pictured on the single’s cover art. I played that song over and over for weeks. I showed it to my friends every chance I got, often quieting the conversation for them to ask, “What song is this?” or “Who is this?” As time passed, I would still ask, “Have I showed you Rosie Tucker?” To which they would reply, “Yeah, you already did.” I must have sounded like a broken record but I really was obsessed with that track. 
Hooked, I started to look up Tucker online. I learned that they are based in Los Angeles, once held a residency at the Bootleg Theater and have performed with the likes of Soccer Mommy and Remo Drive. 
[Their next concert is with Citizen and Wicca Phase Spring Eternal (emos, let me hear you!), and I could not be more upset about the fact that it is sold out. Consider this a shout into the world asking if anyone has a spare ticket.]
My research continued, leading me to Tucker’s record label, New Professor Music. The label claims to be “The World’s Greatest Record Company,” a superlative that makes me smile with its innocent confidence. Based in L.A., the label includes artists like Cheekface, Ramonda Hammer and other artists that have not released music or toured recently. 
Cheekface was the second artist from New Professor that I thoroughly explored. Its doodle-y album art features speech bubbles, obsolete technology and junk food. This quirkiness is also present in the indie-rock trio’s music itself, complete with talk-singing and the perfect amount of cowbell. 
My favorite track of theirs is “‘Listen to Your Heart.’ ‘No.’.” The chorus is a conversation, as insinuated by the title, bouncing between good advice and complete dismissal of said advice. “Listen to your heart (no) / Keep on keeping on (no) / Just say ‘no’ to drugs (no) / Eat a healthy lunch (no)” is just the beginning of this back-and-forth. I find the playful pessimism self-aware and endearing. 
After diving into Cheekface’s discography, I continued my journey through New Professor’s artist roster with the band Ramonda Hammer. Like what I have experienced with Hayley Williams from Paramore and Emily Haines from Metric, this group inspires me to wear thick black eyeliner, stomp on hearts and whip my hair while playing the electric guitar. 
Their lyrics are not shallow, not just about sex, drugs and power like much of rock ‘n’ roll. Frontwoman Devin Davis sings, “I never wanted company / Then welcomed almost anything / I always wanted empathy / I feel it now” in “Empathy,” one of my favorite tracks by the band showcasing the emotional depth that coexists with their harder sound.
The band’s name reminds me of Ramona Flowers, a character from “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” which reminds me of the movie’s soundtrack that could very well feature the songs by Ramonda Hammer. The band’s female-fronted rock sound fits the movie’s tone perfectly. 
I’m grateful that I was ushered back into the world of discovering amazing, up-and-coming musicians by a local, consistently solid record label like New Professor. Its artist roster represents a variety of identities and musical genres, and it provides a platform for otherwise underrepresented people. I also appreciate New Professor’s dedication to the local L.A. art scene, signing smaller artists because the label believes in their music. And New Professor never skimps on quality; I haven’t listened to an artist from the label that I haven’t liked.
This semester really is looking up.

Pedestrians in the McCarthy Quad, Alumni Park and E.F. Hutton Park will find their regular routes obstructed Thursday at noon by crowds who come to watch the work of Los Angeles-based artists in the Visions and Voices program “Dancing the Archives: Emerging Choreographers and Living History.”
Professors Alison D’Amato and Patrick Corbin from the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and Timothy Stanton from USC Libraries, have been organizing this event since early 2019. Their goal was to host an outdoor exhibition that shows students what they can create using the video and visual materials from the recently debuted USC Dance Heritage Video Archive and similar library materials. 
L.A.-based artists Chris Emile, Jinglin Liao and Marina Magalhães, who were selected from an application process, were encouraged to use the DHVA, the USC ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives, the California Historical Society Collection and the Los Angeles City Archives to inspire their new work specific to their presentation locations at the University Park Campus.
“This is just sort of an access point to research in general and using archive material for research whether it’s [for] research to do a performative piece or a paper or an article, whatever you’re doing … in any area of study,” Corbin said. “Our entry point is dance, so we thought that that would be … a fun way to get people in to start engaging with archives in general.” 
In addition to engaging with the archives, artists will interact with their chosen sites to create original performances catered to their surroundings. Interaction with audience members and surrounding elements will look different depending on each artist’s creative vision. 
Liao said she will use this freedom to pull passersby from the high-traffic crossroads of McCarthy Quad and transport the audience to the center of her piece during the middle of her performance. Magalhães said she will use her dancing outdoors as a way to connect to tradition and spawn memory to land that once belonged to other people. 
“It’s not like going to a theater and seeing a dance that would look the same in this theater as it would across town, as it would in another state,” D’Amato said. “These are works that are responding to the location.”
Location is an especially important concept for Magalhães, who used DHVA artist Tonio Guerra’s piece “Snip, Rip, Rumble” in combination with topographical maps and materials that show the relationships between Native Americans and early settlers in California. Magalhães said her work draws upon her relationship with her birthplace in Brazil and discussions about privilege, and she was especially interested in creating a piece that drew upon similar themes of ancestry and diaspora for Thursday’s upcoming performance.
“We’re dancing under a big open sky, there’s trees, the elements are super present,” Magalhães said. “Something that I work with a lot is being able to pull from my own African and indigenous ancestry, as a Latin American person, to inform the dance practice and understanding that a lot of these ancestral spiritual traditions are connected to the earth, and understanding that these elements are sacred and we are extensions of these elements, and therefore our bodies are also sacred.”
Through her piece “Circular” or “Circling Home,” Magalhães said she hopes to create a performance that prompts viewers to question their individual journeys, purpose and relationship with the ground under them. Her work asks audiences to rethink their assumptions, their motives and the extent to which they connect with their ancestral lineage.
“I believe there is no such thing as apolitical art,” Magalhães said. “I think all art is political. Even the very decision to call yourself an apolitical artist is already a political stance, so I think it’s inevitable that all performance, all art, is evoking a certain kind of politics.”
Liao takes a different approach to choreographing her work. The artist said she draws inspiration from animals’ sensitivity, robotic movements and rapid decisions between action and inaction. 
“I follow the muscle and sometimes, I need to stop and I need jump out of this and then [into] something new,” Liao said. “There’s always … an outside eye who is watching. And for me, when I’m dancing, sometimes I’m completely inside it and sometimes I’m jumping out of myself and watching myself dancing.” 
Inspired by Latsky and Goldhuber’s piece “I Hate Modern Dance” in the DHVA, Liao introduces playfulness and audience participation in her work. Her piece aims to engage the audience as it moves viewers around McCarthy Quad, and dancers may draw clueless passersby into the evolving performance as Liao and another dancer act and react to the busy campus around them.
Liao said she was inspired by the emphasis on action and reaction in the archival materials she used and that her performance will employ similar gestures that act upon passersby and respond to their unpredictable reactions. Because it is impossible to choreograph strangers’ movements, the duet must improvise its performance as it navigates McCarthy Quad and its paths and daily traffic that ceases for no one.
Following the open-air performances, a panel featuring the artists and moderated by choreographer Bebe Miller will discuss the ways students and community members can embark on their own projects using tools in the DHVA.
“Bebe is really well-known for doing projects that engage with questions around not only the documentation of choreographic work but how that can take new life,” D’Amato said. “So it’s not just about having a dance that gets documented and preserved and kind of locked away, but it’s really about engaging with the practice of archival and engaging with questions about memory and its relationship to the body.”
Corbin and D’Amato hope that this visual display will inspire students to conduct their own research and create similar original pieces within their own disciplines.

The No. 1 USC men’s tennis team will continue its toughest stretch of the season on the road, preparing for action at the ITA Team Indoor Championship over Friday through Monday.
The Trojans bounced back from Sunday’s tough loss at No. 2 Ohio State with a convincing 6-1 victory over Wisconsin Tuesday in Madison. USC pulled off a hard-fought doubles win before conquering five consecutive singles wins, securing another road win. 
Freshman Stefan Dostanic and senior Riley Smith opened Tuesday’s play by giving the Trojans a 1-0 lead with a 6-3 victory over the host. USC then continued its hot start as Smith and sophomore Bradley Frye took another 2 points to improve the score to 3-0.
Top-ranked junior Daniel Cukierman clinched the victory for the Trojans by defeating his opponents in a 6-2, 6-3 match, and play continued as USC wrapped up the day with a 6-1 victory. 
Head coach Brett Masi praised the team’s impressive performance after the victory.
“We’re just more comfortable playing indoors today,” Masi said. “Guys went on and played with a good purpose after the tough Ohio State loss, [and] they are aiming to perform well in national indoor on Friday.”
The Trojans have received contributions from several players this season, as USC has eight ranked in singles competition. Cukierman headlines the squad, while sophomore Mor Bulis and senior Brandon Holt are both ranked in the top-25 nationally. Five other Trojans, including Smith, Dostanic, freshman Ryder Jackson, sophomore Jake Sands and Frye are also nationally ranked in singles play.
“I don’t think [the ranking] has any pressure on us,” Masi said. “No matter what the rank is, it’s all about the end result of the season … There’s a whole lot to do until the end of May.”
Coming off another road victory, USC will hope to carry its early-season momentum into upcoming matches against other top-ranked programs in the country. 
Masi has high expectations for his players at the upcoming ITA Team Indoor Championship.
“We play a couple schools from outside of California, [so] we will see what the best of best is like,” Masi said. “The goal is to win it, but if we don’t, we’ll see what other teams have and what we can do better to improve.”
Coming in as the No. 2 seed in the draw, USC will open up the ITA Team Indoor Championship against TCU at 10 a.m. Friday to fight for a spot in the quarterfinals.
“The biggest thing is to get some rest, recover for the next few days,” Masi said. “Players are really focused and the goal is to win it on Friday.”

The NFL season ended less than two weeks ago, but football is still not over thanks to the creation of America’s newest professional football league: the XFL.
For those who don’t know much about it, the XFL was founded by billionaire Vince McMahon — the chairman and CEO of the WWE — who had the vision of creating a version of professional football that is faster-paced and more exciting than the NFL. There are currently eight teams in the league located in major cities around the U.S., including one team right here in Los Angeles.
The XFL received generally positive reviews during its opening week, but what makes the average fan think the XFL won’t eventually fizzle out for one reason or another?
The XFL has to contend with the fact that there has never been a more successful football league than the NFL. This past year, people thought there would finally be a successful supplement to the NFL after the creation of the Alliance of American Football, the AAF. However, it folded midway through the season because it didn’t have enough money to fund itself. And from the United Football League to the Fall Experimental Football League, the list of failed professional football leagues goes on and on.
In addition, the XFL could use some help by getting bigger names into the league. Right now, people might recognize players like former Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones or former Raiders punter Marquette King, but for the most part, the league is composed of little-known players who didn’t quite make it in the NFL. 
Still, although the odds are not in its favor, I think the XFL has the potential to establish itself as a sustainable secondary American professional football league. 
To start off, the XFL offers a style of football that fans love, and looking back at its inaugural weekend, it has succeeded so far in creating a distinct kind of football with its modified rules. The game is faster, higher-scoring and overall more action-packed than the average NFL game. The XFL accomplished this with several rule tweaks, including a new point-after conversion system, the legalization of the double forward pass and a new overtime format. Additionally, the XFL encourages teams to punt and kick less, which adds another wrinkle of fourth-down excitement.
The new gameplay is one thing that attracts fans, but another huge, yet controversial,  attraction of the XFL is the return of big hits. 
One of the great frustrations with the NFL has been its crackdown on the hard hits that many football enthusiasts live to see. Nowadays, you won’t see a massive takedown in the NFL without referees raining down penalty flags. Quarterbacks are protected by the rules as well as their own linemen, as both high and low hits are now strongly penalized. The NFL has gotten rid of blindside blocks, lowered shoulders and other ways to land big hits on other players.
I completely understand that the NFL did this for player safety, and to some extent, I agree with the rules. But overall, I think the league has taken it too far — it has all but eliminated a major part of football and has negatively altered the game.
That’s where the XFL can come in and fulfill fans’ cravings for hard-hitting action. This past weekend, I saw at least ten big hits that would have easily been penalized in the NFL for one reason or another, but in the XFL, those plays are legal. And I love it. 
Not only does the XFL provide a unique football viewing experience, but maybe more importantly, the quality of the gameplay is still very high. The XFL could have done anything it wanted with the league to attract fans, but at the end of the day, people won’t want to see games unless the league has good, fundamental football. So far, it appears that the XFL is capable of providing that: The players and coaches are elite and talented, and they have a legitimate chance to prove themselves eligible to NFL teams while in the XFL.
Another reason the XFL has the opportunity to succeed is that it has better resources than any past professional football league. In terms of money, the XFL should not have a major problem as long as it can attract fans because McMahon has a safe amount of finances to run the league. 
In addition, the XFL has already established strong media connections, as games are aired on major channels including FOX, ABC and ESPN. The XFL also airs its games during primetime evening weekend hours when plenty of people have the downtime to watch a full game. Having content readily available on major networks gives the league greater exposure and credibility. Fans can watch an XFL game just as easily as they can watch any NFL or NCAA football game.
Whether it’s the money or the gameplay, the XFL has what it takes to succeed. The real question comes down to whether fans will buy into the league and give it life.
At this past weekend’s games, the XFL drew in around 17,000 fans at each stadium, which is low for football — but at the same time, it also drew in about three million viewers per game on TV. If the XFL can get those numbers to keep growing, I wouldn’t be surprised if we have found a spring football league that is here to stay.

A new era is officially underway for USC baseball.
The Trojans will play their first game of the 2020 season Friday against Western Michigan under new head coach Jason Gill. Gill, who came to USC in June after 11 seasons at Loyola Marymount, has spent the time leading up to this season implementing his greatest philosophy: Never accept average.
“If I could pass on to [my players] anything, it would be for them to never accept mediocrity of themselves,” Gill said. “To set standards that are achievable for them to reach. Whether it’s in the classroom, socially or on the baseball field, anywhere they’re at to not settle for being just OK at anything.”
Gill, a Southern California native, is finally at a place he has always wanted to be with USC. “It’s been my dream job since I got into the profession,” Gill said. “The history of the program is better than any college baseball program. [USC has produced] more big leaguers than anybody, we have Hall of Famers, we have All-Stars, we have Cy Young Award winners. And I think if you’re from Southern California, you want to be at the top — this is where you want to be. So it’s kind of a no-brainer for me, to be honest with you.”
Gill credits his parents for his positive and determined outlook on life, as he believes the resources that were provided to him from an early age have shaped him and defined his coaching career.
“Growing up in a loving family, with a mom and dad that taught me perspective, that taught me work ethic, that relayed to me that your attitude is your decision and that you choose the path that you want to go on,” Gill said.
At Gill’s high school, Mater Dei, his baseball coach Bob Ikes taught him all the skills he would later exemplify for his own players: accountability, responsibility, being on time and knowing who you are. At Cal State Fullerton, Gill played for coach Augie Garrido, a well-known College Baseball Hall of Famer and, as Gill puts it, “arguably the best college baseball coach to ever work.”
Now, Gill aims to transfer the skills and lessons he learned from his mentors into his own players. 
“He’s been in this for so long … and he just brings so much to the table instilling discipline within us and just motivating us every single day,” junior outfielder Bart West said about Gill’s leadership. 
Gill started as an assistant coach at Nevada from 1997-98. During his time there, he helped lead the Wolfpack to their second postseason appearance ever. In 1999 and 2000, Gill was the assistant coach for LMU. In both those seasons, the Lions won West Coast Conference titles.
He then spent three years at UC Irvine alongside head coach John Savage, recruiting a No. 8 class in the country in 2002 with a pair of top-30 classes succeeding that. The Anteaters reappeared in the postseason in 2004.
Gill was later the hitting coach and recruiting coordinator at both Cal State Fullerton and Oregon. He brought in a top-10 recruiting class at Fullerton in 2007 before rebuilding the Oregon baseball program. 
At LMU, Gill led the team to the WCC Tournament five out of the last six years, winning it last season and in 2017. Overall, Gill posted a 322-286-1 (.530) record during his time with the Lions.
To add to his impressive resume, he also served as an assistant coach for the U.S. Collegiate National Team in 2012 and 2016. 
“In any venture of life, if you’re fortunate enough to be in the same business and you love your job, you’re gonna learn from your mistakes,” Gill said of what his experience has taught him about coaching. “So I think at the end of the day, I’ve learned more than anything that it’s about relationships and about development over wins. I think the wins are a byproduct of that.”
As for his USC players, Gill has already made a striking impact in motivating them for the 2020 season. 
“Coach Gill’s doing an incredible job with kind of instilling his mindset into us and how we carry ourselves every day,” said senior first baseman John Thomas, who added that Gill’s mentorship has led him to become a better leader for his teammates. 
Bringing together all of his experience as a player, recruiter, assistant coach and head coach, Gill hopes to continue the great track record the Trojan baseball program has accumulated over the years. With 12 national championships, 21 visits to the College World Series and 114 players sent to the major leagues, Gill is now tasked with bringing the Trojans back to national relevance and the College World Series for the first time since 2001.
But Gill is ready for that challenge.
“The biggest gift that I can give [the players] is to be present,” Gill said. “Be where you’re at and reach your full potential. Don’t settle.”

There are some aspects of American culture that are incredibly consistent, no matter the era. Prom, football games, graduation, the move to a faraway dorm filled with a bunch of strangers — all are included in this bucket list of sorts. The underlying pressure to check off all these boxes to seem normal or give off the illusion of fulfillment is an issue many have to grapple with. These same problems reach an entirely new level, though, for members of the first- and second-generation immigrant community. 
Much of Western culture is centered around independence, personal goals and self-growth. At 18, many kids move away for college and continue to live without their family after graduating. The movies and shows that portray coming-of-age moments for young adults mirror similar life paths in which protagonists find their place in life separate from their family. 
The college experience itself is painted with a similar brush: This is supposed to be the time when one discovers themself far away from their home and roots. Sure, they can be homesick for a little while, but there’s an expiration date for that time. Then it’s off to becoming what Western society defines as an adult: someone whose life path is forged by ourself — or at most, with our college friends. 
These homogeneous cultural norms tend to contrast with a lot of those of non-Western culture that, despite assimilation, are still integral to first- and second-gen immigrant life. Contrasting with the highly valued independence of Western society, the family unit is an essential part of Latinx, Middle Eastern and Asian cultures. A decision, whether it be about school, dating, careers or even house decorations, is usually dependent upon the nuclear and extended families’ opinions. If simply going to the mall means that a great aunt, three cousins and some uncles will tag along, then what can we say about something as important as college? 
College is  already branded as a lonely life transition, but its effects are felt even more by first- and second-gen students because of how foreign this lifestyle is to their cultural values. While part of bicultural identity rests upon acceptance of both Western and non-Western cultures, it’s difficult to shake the familial obligations one was raised with. How does one go from attending the weekly family dinner with 15 family members every week to eating dinner with three sort-of-friends at a bland, gray dorm room table? 
It is because of this struggle that many first- and second-gen students attend universities and community colleges close to home. The obligation to the family unit outweighs the values of independence that we’re taught through Western media and interpersonal relationships. First-gen parents and extended family members often expect their kids not to stray far away from home and, if possible, commute from home to university. 
But this doesn’t play into the idealized college experience that shows like “Boy Meets World” equate to happiness and normalcy. Commuting from home feels like a lower-level, alternative reality for people who don’t possess the maturity or financial capital to live on or near campus. First- and second-gen students, therefore, feel like they aren’t “normal” or living a fulfilled life because they aren’t playing into the life path that is expected of them. 
This pressure is ratcheted up when there are economic obligations to the family unit as well. The pseudo-communal style of life of familial closeness means that many children of immigrants must work part-time — and sometimes full-time — jobs to support their parents, siblings and extended family members, in addition to attending college. 
Shaking the feeling that one is somehow abnormal for living a life that is different from their more Americanized peers is integral to recognizing the inherent maturity and beauty that comes with embracing obligation to family. Entering adulthood and prioritizing closeness with family aren’t mutually exclusive entities; one can live with their parents, spend time with their cousins and enjoy their Friday nights at family dinner without having missed some big, independent, transformative experience that many believe is tied to a cutoff of the family unit. 
Discourse, whether it be in writing, on TV or even just in conversation, can help normalize this aspect of generational immigrant subculture. This version of reality isn’t unique to just one second-gen student, and recognizing just how common it is to stray from the common upper-middle class American story can make us feel less guilty for missing weekend parties to instead watch Turkish soap operas with our aunts and cousins.

As the weather starts to get colder, students across campus begin to look for places to study where they don’t have to be outside in the wind or the super-cold-for-L.A. weather. Besides the libraries, which are often crowded during peak hours, there are few spaces for students to study that are not major- or discipline-specific. That’s not to say that an engineer can’t go to the new Annenberg building to study — no one is stopping them — but an engineer may not see any of their peers in that space. 
USC needs to make more discipline-specific study spaces available on campus (and it has the room to do so). This small change would make it easier for commuter students to stay on campus between long class breaks. Additionally, creating such study spaces would foster a sense of community between students of similar majors who may not otherwise interact in or outside of class. 
While libraries are a viable alternative, the two main libraries on campus, Leavey and Doheny, suffer from overcrowding and are not conducive to collaborative studying. During midterms and other busy times of the year, any USC student would be hard-pressed to find a space in the library to sit down and work. For those who want to work with others, most of the spaces in both libraries are cordoned off for quiet studying, and the small study rooms in Leavey have to be reserved in advance. By making some classrooms in either Taper Hall, von KleinSmid Center or Grace Ford Salvatori Hall available for students, those seeking to work collaboratively could have a space to do so without needing to leave campus to go to someone’s house or apartment.
For all the students who live in Los Angeles and commute to school, three-to four-hour breaks can be tricky to navigate with few indoor spaces to study. Given L.A.’s notorious traffic, it would be infeasible for students to go home, so staying on campus is their best option. Even for students who live a mile off campus, going back and forth to their house or apartment is rather impractical. On days where it’s too hot or, rarely, too cold, students are forced to stay outside, go to a library or go to one of the newer buildings like Annenberg or Marshall. For students not from those schools, it can feel rather isolating, as they are unlikely to run into classmates or peers in either of the buildings. By creating spaces for people who study disciplines outside of communications or business, USC can help build communities for students with similar interests.
Major- or discipline-specific study rooms could also help students from small programs meet and mingle with each other. For the narrative studies majors in the English department, there is no single introductory class that all students must take. Other interdisciplinary majors, like philosophy, politics and law, have similar structures, making it hard for their students to meet and socialize. By opening up study rooms that are discipline-specific, though not exclusionary to people of other majors, USC can foster a sense of community within these majors where students often feel isolated from each other.
This problem of the lack of available, on-campus and inclusionary indoor study spaces could be easily solved by opening up some unused classrooms in von KleinSmid Center, Grace Ford Salvatori Hall or Taper Hall. Making these spaces available to students in the afternoon would put no extra strain on the University, and it would even alleviate some of the overcrowding in libraries and the few other indoor study spaces on campus. In addition to making rooms in these buildings available for more collaborative studying, there are many empty rooms in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center that can be used as classrooms or meeting rooms — perfect spaces for students to meet and study together. 
Making collaborative indoor study spaces available for students will benefit commuter students, those in smaller, interdisciplinary majors and any student who is looking for a place to finish a group project.

Las Vegas casino executive Gamal Abdelaziz, who is accused of paying for his daughter to be admitted to USC as a false athletic recruit through the admissions scandal, submitted a request to the federal court in June to use Nixon Peabody as his defense, despite a potential conflict of interest due to the firm’s prior work for USC and for a Stanford University coach named in the admissions case. 
Firm Nixon Peabody represented USC in a case involving health care and intellectual property and currently represents John Vandemoer, a Stanford sailing coach who accepted $610,000 in bribes to facilitate the admission of two Stanford applicants as sailing recruits in the Operation Varsity Blues case.
In an order filed in June, Abdelaziz’s defense contended that no conflict existed between Nixon Peabody representing Abdelaziz and USC because of the differences in the subject matter of each case and stated the University had not shared information about the admissions case with the law firm. 
Nixon Peabody’s prior relationship with USC and Vandemoer had previously raised questions about whether defending Abdelaziz would present a conflict of interest. However, Brian Kelly, a Nixon Peabody attorney representing Abdelaziz, stated that Vandemoer was not a cooperating witness in the admissions case and that the government likely will not call Vandemoer to testify against Abdelaziz.
“There is no ‘direct adversity’ because there is no conflict between the legal rights and duties of USC and the legal rights and duties of Mr. Abdelaziz,” the order read. “Nor is there any material limitation on Nixon Peabody’s ability to represent Mr. Abdelaziz stemming from, for instance, USC sharing confidences with Nixon about the subject matter of this case (which it has not done).”
Abdelaziz allegedly paid $300,000 to designate his daughter as a USC women’s basketball recruit in March 2018. He enlisted the help of scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer, who coordinated with senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and former assistant women’s soccer coach Laura Janke to create a falsified recruitment profile for Abdelaziz’s daughter that listed several fabricated international basketball awards. Heinel then presented the profile to an admissions subcommittee, which extended Abdelaziz’s daughter an offer of conditional acceptance contingent on maintaining a 3.3 GPA during her final semester of high school, according to court documents.
Abdelaziz faces charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is one of 15 parents in the college admissions case, including 11 USC parents, who have pleaded not guilty and will stand trial beginning in October.

Senators shared preliminary results for a survey gauging student interest regarding an ongoing project to create a digital resource bank of past course syllabuses at the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday.
Of the 248 students who took the survey, more than 200 said the syllabus bank would improve their academic performance, according to information Sen. Ben Rosenthal presented at the meeting.
The project, proposed by Sens. Rosenthal, Emily Johnson and Randi Anderson, aims to make the syllabuses available to students to use when selecting classes to clarify course curriculum and give students a better understanding of the classes they register for, Rosenthal said. 
“There’s an overwhelming desire by the students for it, and even people who don’t think that they necessarily need it still think that it’s an idea,” he said. “Most people think that they need it, or at least it would help them, so these are really promising responses.”
Rosenthal said he hopes having access to course syllabuses during registration will decrease student conflicts with exams by ensuring students know important course dates in advance.
“[The syllabus bank would be beneficial] for reasons like academic transparency and improving the ability of people to know what your classes are about, but also, there’s a lot of classes that have mandatory midterm days,” Rosenthal said. “If you’re going on spring break, you want to make sure that your class doesn’t have a midterm that Friday, for example.”
The project’s next steps involve meeting with members of the Academic Senate to gain approval for the bank’s creation and partnering with IT Services to implement the resource online. 
“After we get Academic Senate approval, it would just be a question of taking the policy side of it in terms of their approval of it and the IT side … and just merging those together,” Rosenthal said. “I don’t think [it] will be too hard as long as we get Academic Senate approval.”
Rosenthal said he has also been working with the USC’s nomenclature task force to draft a proposal with recommendations on the procedure to rename campus buildings. The task force was created in light of controversy surrounding the name of the Von KleinSmid Center, which was named after former USC president and white supremacist Rufus von KleinSmid. Rosenthal, who was appointed to the task force last summer, said the group hopes to finish the proposal and release it to the University administration within the next two weeks.
“We’ve been working on editing the proposal because it’s a very public document that will likely not just get scrutinized by administrators at USC but the broader public [as well],” Rosenthal said. “We’re making sure that it’s both understandable and robust enough to get administrative buy in but also succinct so that it doesn’t bore people.” 
Sens. Benjamin Shiff and Rose Ritch and Director of Residential Affairs Gabriel Savage have also begun working with Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni to list USC’s religious absence policy on syllabuses to ensure students know they can make arrangements for exams that fall on religious holidays. Currently, the policy, which grants excused absences for religious observances, is only available on the Office of Religious Life website and is emailed to professors before each school year, Shiff said.
“This is meant for students who have finals during Ramadan or class midterms during the Jewish holidays at the beginning of the year, or if you don’t necessarily get school off [for the holidays],” Shiff said. “We’ve also created a text you put on the syllabus.”

Health care workers protested a Keck Medicine of USC policy change Tuesday that the workers said would negatively impact the quality of care they provide. The policy will reduce sick leave allowances, causing protesters to worry that it could lead employees to arrive to work sick and pose a health risk to patients, especially those with immune system deficiencies.
Marching up and down San Pablo and Norfolk streets, more than 50 workers chanted “USC, you can’t hide” and “Hands off my PTO,” referring to their paid time off. 
Under the new policy that will take effect Feb. 16, Keck workers can take up to 96 hours of sick leave per year, including hours used from paid time off. The current policy does not limit the amount of paid time off that can be used for short-term illness, according to flyers demonstrators handed out at the picket line. The change also states that an unexcused absence from work without advanced notice will result in a final warning before termination. Disciplinary action is currently taken after an employee accrues six unexcused absences. Protesters said the new policy compromises their ability to care for dependents when they fall ill.
“We’re picketing because it’s not only affecting us as workers, it’s also affecting the family that we raise, from our children to our elderly parents,” said Bernadette Ramos, a registered nurse who attended the protest. “We have to fight for this because we don’t want to call in sick, but we have to have that guarantee that when we need it, it will be there for us.” 
Keck Medicine said in a statement that its new policy complies with local, state and federal law, and it will continue to honor protected leaves of absence as stipulated by labor laws. Los Angeles requires a minimum of 48 hours of paid sick leave, and USC provides 96 hours to all its employees, which can be used for personal sick days or time off to care for ill relatives.
The protesters, which included medical assistants and technicians, respiratory therapists and registered nurses, said the change would cause more hospital employees to come to work sick and potentially transmit diseases to their patients.
“You don’t want to come in sick and then have our patients, who are susceptible to all kinds of illnesses, be exposed to us as well,” Ramos said. “We like our job. We like being nurses. But if they don’t let us go have our rest time when we’re sick, then we will come sick. And who will that benefit? Nobody.”
Keck Medicine Chief Operations Officer Marty Sargeant said Keck Medicine adamantly discourages its employees from coming to work sick and provides workers with preventive resources to lower the risk of contagious disease.
“We take a big stance that the intention behind this policy is not to have people come to work sick,” Sargeant said. “We will ensure that that we do provide the proper protections and we do have the appropriate preventive means — the masks, the flu vaccine, etc. — to ensure we keep our employees healthy and keep our patients healthy as well.”
Shirley Calderon, a registered nurse at Keck Hospital, said if the policy issue is not resolved by allowing adequate hours for workers to take sick leave or care for their ill family members, she would consider looking for a job at another hospital. 
“It’s not like I haven’t been offered other jobs,” said Calderon, who is currently pregnant. “If I’m here, it’s because I’ve been here for 10 years, and I do believe in taking care of our patients. This is one of the top hospitals, so I would expect them to have a little bit more consideration toward our staff and our patients.”
Keck Hospital continued normal operation during the picketing, Keck Medicine wrote in statementw. The department also said it respects the rights of the workers, who belonged to national health care workers’ and nurses’ unions, to demonstrate.
“Keck Medicine of USC updated its attendance and punctuality policy to ensure that the organization continues to provide the exceptional care our patients expect from us each and every day,” the statement read. “Our number one priority during this informational picket — and always — is to provide outstanding patient care.”
Doug Kauffman, a discharge planning coordinator in Keck’s social services division, said the new policy would force health care professionals to show up to work sick to avoid disciplinary action from the policy and believes that the protest will help inform workers of their rights. 
“The point of the protest is really to mobilize all the workers at Keck and Norris [Cancer Center] who are going to be impacted by the policy and to let the community at large and patients know that the policies that the Keck administration is trying to put in place are going to be a threat to their own health,” Kauffman said. 
The demonstrators carried signs that read “Standing up for our patients” and “Protecting the public begins with protecting health care workers” and set up an informational banner with statistics on Keck’s nursing staff deficits. USC nurses worked more than 43,000 hours of overtime and double-time, and the medical centers currently have a 92-nurse shortage, according to information presented by the protesters.
However, Sargeant said he could not confirm whether Keck is experiencing a shortage of nursing staff but that the medical centers ensure they meet staff-to-patient ratio guidelines and fill in the gaps with nurses from an agency Keck partners with.
“I can tell you that every day we look at our staffing, and we make sure we meet the appropriate ratios that are set forward by the state and ensure, more importantly, that we have the appropriate nursing care for the high acuity of our patients,” Sargeant said.
Ultimately, protestors want to reach an agreement with Keck administration using a shared governance model which has parties share the responsibility of creating policies that will affect the hospital staff. 
“We want them to collaborate with us … to create a policy that’s safe for our patients and supports our staff,” said Keck registered nurse Tveen Kirkpatrick. “A policy that we both can stand by.”

Happy month of Candy Grams, secret admirers and capitalist consumption! Whether you’re currently in the throes of a whirlwind Tinder fling or were recently left at the altar, you’ll be sure to find something of interest in this month’s guide to all things streaming. Here are some of the latest titles coming to your favorite streaming services. 
Netflix
“To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You”
Given the popularity of 2018’s teen romance “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” it comes as no surprise that Netflix will be releasing a highly-anticipated sequel just in time for Valentine’s Day. Fans of Jenny Han’s hit young adult novel series will definitely not be disappointed. Beginning Feb. 12, you can stream the film with a Netflix subscription. Come for Noah Centineo’s face-of-Netflix looks, stay for a story that is just the right mixture of heartwarming and cheesy you need.
“Taylor Swift: Miss Americana” Season 3
OK, so, this much-talked-about Taylor Swift documentary came out in late January. But consider this a firm reminder that if you haven’t seen it yet, you should. Friends long proclaiming their hatred toward Swift are now texting me expressing their allegiance to the “Lover” singer. And I have to say, I have rekindled my elementary-school love for the “Fearless” album after viewing the film, directed by acclaimed documentarian Lana Wilson. OK, after viewing it twice.
“Horse Girl”
The title of this film conjures up images of horse movies like “Flicka” and “National Velvet,” but this Netflix drama could not be more different. “Horse Girl” looks as terrifying as it is intriguing. Allison Brie co-wrote and stars in the film, based on her grandmother’s experiences with mental illness. It is directed by Jeff Baena of “The Little Hours.”
“Good Time”
“Uncut Gems” was snubbed at the Oscars, big time. Show your support for the Safdie Brothers by streaming their 2017 feature; it’s arguably their best movie. Robert Pattinson gives the performance of a lifetime opposite Jennifer Jason Leigh and Benny Safdie himself, who is playing a bank robber trying to steal enough money to get his brother out of jail. The film is available to be streamed now.
Hulu
“Bridget Jones’s Diary”
All three “Bridget Jones” films were made available on Hulu Feb. 1, just in time for you to crawl into bed with a pint of ice cream and sing “All By Myself” with the patron saint of singletons herself. I, for one, am excited — consider it a celebration of Renée Zellweger’s Oscar win. Oh, and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth aren’t bad either.
“High Fidelity”
This rom-com series starring Zoë Kravitz and Jake Lacy is set to be released Feb. 14. Adapted from the 2000 movie of the same name, the series takes place in a record store and is certain to have a killer soundtrack (if the trailer, featuring David Bowie’s “Modern Love,” tells me anything). Music lover Rob (Kravitz) goes down a rabbit hole of asking her past loves “what went wrong,” reliving awkward and heartwarming experiences as she learns to love herself.
Amazon Prime
“The Spy Next Door”
This could be the most exciting news I’ve heard all month. Don’t let the 12% on Rotten Tomatoes fool you — this movie rocks. Jackie Chan, Amber Valletta and Billy Ray Cyrus (yes) star in this 2010 dramedy featuring undercover agents, pet pigs and your mom’s new fiancée. It’s “Mrs. Doubtfire” meets “Mr. and Mrs. Smith.” Thank me later.

I’ve always admired Jay Gatsby’s ability to dream in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s masterpiece, “The Great Gatsby.” An optimist like Gatsby, I cheered him on as he worked 10 times harder than the next guy to make a name for himself so that he could win over the heart of his true love, Daisy. 
But when it turned out to be that this dream ironically led to Gatsby’s own demise, I forced myself to reconsider my blind loyalty to the hobby of dreaming.   
Fitzgerald’s novel still carries a continuing legacy almost 100 years since its first release in 1925. Though “The Great Gatsby” takes place in the Roaring ’20s, its lesson about the dangers of confusing imagination with reality remains relevant today. With rich commentary on the foolishness of a class-based society and the inability to let go of the past, the novel touches upon various themes and pressing issues that parallel many similar difficulties faced in today’s society. 
While we obviously can’t ask the literary genius what he himself hoped readers would learn and grasp from his piece, we do know that he put his heart and soul into this project. 
“While I have every hope and plan of finishing my novel [“The Great Gatsby”] in June, you know how those things often come out, and even if it takes me 10 times that long I cannot let it go out unless it has the very best I’m capable of in it, or even, as I feel sometimes, something better than I’m capable of,” Fitzgerald wrote to his editor Max Perkins in 1924. 
In a sense, the novel is open to varying interpretations as to what Fitzgerald’s true message is about people and society. That is the beauty of this book; it allows both you and me to take away whatever we want — whatever stood out to us in the midst of the well-written prose that is Fitzgerald’s writing. 
And to me, the most important enduring truth the novel teaches us is to never let the dreams of our past blind us from our goals for the present and the future. 
Reading it for the first time as a requirement for my English 3 IB class in high school, I quickly began to appreciate the work of art the novel is. I identified with Gatsby: his dream of financial success, his dream for love, his dream of unrealistic aspirations. All of it. 
I, too, was hypnotized by the dark side of idealism. 
Yet, unlike Gatsby, I had hindsight vision and the upper hand in figuring out the costs of letting the past drive and dictate your current dreams. Diving into the world of Gatsby as I voraciously read through the pages from the first-person narration by Gatsby’s friend, Nick Carraway, I watched the young Gatsby grow into a man. 
Infatuated with recreating things just how they were in the past with Daisy, Gatsby becomes consumed by the undertaking. He does not give himself a second to just stop and truly think about the reason behind his actions and behavior and falls victim to living in the past instead of living in the moment — a situation that I, and so many others, are familiar with.
Reiterating this life lesson and tragic truth, Fitzgerald concluded his novel with Carroway narrating words that I will never forget. 
“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us,” Carroway wrote. “It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther …  And one fine morning — so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
Comparing Gatsby’s need for the future to resemble his past —as represented by the green light — and the everyday man’s struggle to achieve their dreams by recreating their past, Fitzgerald reminds us of the danger of not moving beyond what has already happened. 
As humans we are constantly being drawn back by the current as we attempt to row forward. 
I’m not saying to stop dreaming. On the contrary, I say to never stop doing so because the day you do is the same day that you forget how to strive for what’s best for you. You forget how to believe, how to love, how to wish. 
At USC, I know that sometimes it becomes hard to dream. Getting caught up in classes, being involved with several extracurriculars, trying to secure an internship — we can easily forget who we exactly want to be and what we want to achieve. But, as members among some of the brightest minds of the Trojan family, I remind us all (myself included) to never lose sight on what’s most important: believing in ourselves, dreaming and accomplishing our wildest goals. 
I encourage us all to dream with the same passion as Gatsby, but at the same time, I ask us all to make time for introspection — to pause and observe one’s own conscious thoughts and feelings. By doing so, we permit ourselves to determine whether our dreams are balanced between reality and fantasy, and that they are not just manifestations from the past. 
Only then can we truly escape the struggle to transform our imaginative dreams into the real world.

In 2007, a team of researchers in Germany led by neuroscientist Kathrin Koch published a paper claiming to pin down the differences in neural activity between men and women as they process emotions. Their paper feeds into the stereotype that women are more emotional than men, and it is part of a greater problem known as neurosexism — the hunt for sex-based differences in the brain that supposedly explain stereotyped gender roles. 
Publications like that aren’t just bad science; they imply that there is a legitimate basis for gender discrimination. While researchers can make a case for studying sex-based neurological differences for the sake of understanding biological mechanisms, it frequently turns into a poor extrapolation of data that attempts to substantiate misogyny.
Koch’s study is not an anomaly in scientific literature. Every few years, a new study emerges in neuroscience that claims to “finally” reveal the difference between male and female brains. Yet more often than not, they are attention-grabbing publications that lack scientific rigor. 
In a brain imaging study conducted at the University of Giessen in Germany, researchers hypothesized that showing disgust and fear-inducing pictures would elicit greater activation of emotion-processing parts of the brain in women than men. When they found that men actually had more active amygdalas, the part of the brain associated with processing fear, they explained that the male participants were responding to aggression depicted in the images, appealing to long-held beliefs about aggressive behavior in men and neglecting the possibility that men could be more sensitive to fear. Similarly, in Koch’s study, the authors prefaced their findings by stating that “women are generally regarded as ‘more emotional’ than men.”
As philosopher Robyn Bluhm explains in her paper on sex-difference science, the subconscious gender biases that have been ingrained in researchers can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which they skew their findings to support preexisting notions. Instead of questioning the validity of these age-old assumptions, they seek evidence that supports them.
According to cognitive neuroscientist and neurosexism expert Gina Rippon, there has been a recent shift in narrative from male and female brains being different to being complementary. 
A 2014 brain imaging study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania modeled connections in the brain and claimed that male brains show greater connectivity in each hemisphere, whereas female brains have more connections between the two hemispheres. The researchers argue that these differences imply that “males have better motor and spatial abilities, whereas females have superior memory and social cognition skills,” and that these “sex differences in human behavior show adaptive complementarity.” The shift to seeking complementarity remains problematic because, in addition to defining a gender binary, they also perpetuate heteronormative thought.
Gender bias in neuroscience can have greater repercussions in science and medicine as a whole. A wide body of research has shown that doctors are more likely to downplay women’s reports of pain than in male patients, resulting in fewer pain medication prescriptions and more misdiagnoses. In extreme cases like heart attacks, where women are less likely to seek help for in fear of being seen as hypochondriacs, this issue of gender bias becomes life-or-death.
This kind of discrimination stems from the stereotype that women are more emotional or irrational, the very misconceptions that sex-difference neuroscience tries to validate. The interplay between gender bias in medicine and sex-difference research is a harmful one, in which ostensible neurological evidence of gendered behavior gives scientists and doctors a basis to justify discriminatory practices, even if those biases manifest subconsciously.
Furthermore, ideas about scientifically validated sex differences can spread beyond science and medicine. A case of neurosexism made headlines in 2017 when Google engineer James Damore published a memo arguing that women are biologically ill-suited for working in tech, citing psychological sex differences as explanations for the disproportionate lack of women in the industry. He was subsequently fired, but in an update to his original memo, Damore states that some of his colleagues had reached out to him to express their agreement despite the widespread public backlash, indicating that he was not alone in his ideas. 
Both gender bias in medicine and Damore’s memo exemplifies the tangible harm that neurosexism can have on everyday thinking in a variety of industries. Researchers who continue to seek a scientific basis for gender stereotypes must recognize the role their work plays in reinforcing negative stereotypes and shift away from this line of thinking.

A large-scale institution like USC requires accountability for an omnipresent organization such as the Undergraduate Student Government. However, this is not the case today. USG has lost sight of accountability and abandoned performance measures. In turn, USG’s systemic lapses have led to a siloing from the average University student, resulting in a legislative branch that has failed to bridge the gap between voters and its student government. 
A lack of oversight has eroded the accountability provided by USC’s legislative branch. Ask most students and they’d struggle to name our president, let alone a senator. Tucked away in the corner of Ronald Tutor Campus Center, legislators debate matters that students aren’t aware of, marking progress that many can’t see. This lack of transparency has arisen through a disruption of the relationship among USC’s legislators, who are accountable to a mere fraction of USC’s undergraduate student body but have strained their accountability through the way they’ve attained it.
Campaigning students frequently lobby large interest groups on campus, and the lobbying of Greek life provides an encapsulation of the methods used. Candidates frequently tap into existing Greek networks and an unsubstantiated sales pitch can unlock an endorsement from the president of the respective organization. Once the endorsement is received, roughly 100 new voters are added to the bloc with no vested interest in the candidate’s policy. The system facilitates Greek life into becoming a voting behemoth, a quasi-lobbying organization that substitutes financing with votes. Student politics become a popularity contest centered around who you know rather than what you do. 
As connections drown out policy, candidates subsequently build information blocks that are cemented the day they are sworn in. As the game was always about personality, and not necessarily policy, grandiose campaign promises become washed away by reality’s currents. Swept under the rug are voters who were assured such promises, with the voter not caring enough to pressure the legislator. Alternatively, as campaigners have no performance checker once in office, they are able to break their promise made to the voter while on the campaign trail. In turn the voter, either disinterested or disenfranchised, facilitates student government’s construction of an echo chamber removed from the needs of the ordinary USC student.
With the voter-legislator connection severed, the issue is further compounded by the absence of the re-electability incentive. As most elected officials are one and done, most are not incentivized to optimize their track record for re-election, as they will not be seeking re-election. This gives elected officials the ability to turn back on campaign promises, misrepresent ideals or simply do nothing. Of course, there are legislators with outstanding track records that genuinely dedicate themselves to improving the livelihood of USC. But think of those who are unable to. The rigor of academia can frequently be overwhelming, and many of today’s legislators may opt in favor of abandoning legislative representation instead of implementing a productive bill due to the grueling hours it may take to pass it.
This is why no student legislator can be to blame for they are merely playing by the rules of the game. But a lack of blame is exactly the point, as who is one to point toward for governmental failures? Though there are rules to the game, it quickly becomes evident that those exact rules are inherently flawed. USG manufactures a system that does not promote engagement beyond a vote that is meaningless to the very voter that produces it. If elected officials do not have an accountability mechanism to their voters, they cannot be held accountable to anyone nor anything, as the voter-legislator relationship is the cornerstone to every functioning democracy.
So how does this multi-million dollar organization fix its rules? Reform the system. Establish senators who are elected by year group, residential area (including an allocation of off-campus senators) or even student organizations. 
It seems today’s system has rusted from its current set of rules and the incentives it creates. Removing the rust means analysis of incentives, referendum proposals and debate facilitation. Such adjustments can serve to increase engagement and repair accountability. If USG can serve as a microcosm of U.S. politics, its microcosmic setting allows for tweaks and experimentation. Such tweaks can save USG’s electorate system.

Last weekend marked the beginning of what many American sports fans consider to be the worst part of the year — a miserable stretch of time between the end of the Super Bowl and the beginning of March Madness where all we have left to watch is NBA games where  players clearly do not care enough yet to try and NHL games that no one within 50 square miles of you is aware of. 
Gone are the weekends of watching football and the weekdays of watching football highlights. Now, for approximately one month, sports fans are left to lie alone and idle, reminiscing over the once-constant stream of football that now feels like a distant memory. 
We can draw several conclusions from this feeling of existential sports dread. First, I should get out more, and second, sports are very important in the United States — so important that some have gone as far as to call it “America’s religion.”
“The sports stadium has replaced the church sanctuary as the dominant arena of piety at the turn of the 21st century,” wrote professor and theologian Randall Balmer in an article for Sojourners. 
The numbers back up Balmer’s claim as well. A week and a half ago, 99.9 million viewers tuned in to watch Super Bowl LIV. This represented a slight uptick from the previous year: Super Bowl LIII garnered 98.2 million. To add icing to the cake, when factoring in the use of streaming platforms, Super Bowl LIV’s viewership increases to 102 million people. 
In light of America’s current state of political participation, this is deeply discouraging. Through both qualitative and quantitative lenses, we appear to be a country more invested in professional sports than our democratic processes. And while I recognize that it is easier to take in the joys of a football game than it is to vote, the idea that we are collectively more concerned with the fate of the Kansas City Chiefs than the fate of the United States is alarming.
One day after the Super Bowl, the Iowa caucuses began. From what I understand, it’s an event where a bunch of politically active Iowans take work off to assemble in gymnasiums, churches, libraries and homes throughout the state to duke it out and pick the candidate they want to represent their party in the general election.
How this plays out in reality is still hazy to me no matter how many articles I read online, but the big takeaway is that these caucuses have correctly picked the Democratic Party’s eventual nominee 100% of the time over the past five election cycles. So, they’re very important. 
Unfortunately, unlike Super Bowl LIV, where the NFL orchestrated a flawless halftime show and succeeded in making droves of straight white males feel like strong, independent Latinx women, the Iowa caucuses were a disaster. 
In Iowa, complications with an app designed to deliver caucus results to the state Democratic Party led to a politically apocalyptic meltdown where election results that were supposed to arrive by the end of the night took an additional three days. 
Could you imagine if a three-day delay had befallen the Superbowl? Even a 30-minute delay would have drawn the unquenchable outrage of fans and corporate sponsors alike. 
What’s more is that turnout at the Iowa caucuses fell well below expectations. Only 176,000 out of 616,000 actively registered Democrats in Iowa participated in the caucuses. That is a 29% participation rate. 
In comparison, a 2014 poll conducted by the Associated Press and GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications found that there were about 160 million NFL fans in America. When Super Bowl LIV’s viewership is taken into account, that means 63% of fans tuned in to watch the game. 
I recognize that in real life, explanations for both events and their outcomes are more complicated than I have given them credit for. Democracy is a hairy, messy affair, and far more barriers to entry exist for voting than for watching the Super Bowl. But am I alone in thinking to myself that this 34-point discrepancy is terrifying?
If 29% of football fans were to watch the Super Bowl, life would continue as it always had. The Chiefs would have still won the Super Bowl, Jimmy Garoppolo would still have choked, and you still would have gone to work or class the next day. 
However, when 29% of eligible voters vote, the foundations of our American democracy crumble. 29 % means that over two-thirds of the electorate’s voices were not heard. It means that hundreds of thousands of citizens did not possess the means, will or desire to vote, which becomes especially worrisome when the issues those citizens have the opportunity to affect are not passing yards and points allowed, but health care and climate change. 
It is disheartening when the passion of NFL fans exceeds the political participation of the American populace. In democracy, participation doesn’t determine the winner of a game but the fate of an entire nation. Unfortunately for our country, attendance is lacking.

The USC men’s basketball team will return to Galen Center Thursday to face off against Washington. This will be the two teams’ second meeting this season after the Huskies handed the Trojans a 72-40 loss in Seattle in January. 
USC is in the midst of a three-game losing streak prompted by tough competition against ranked opponents. The Trojans took a 78-57 thrashing at home to No. 16 Colorado and followed with two close losses against then No. 23 Arizona and Arizona State on the road. USC was outpaced in transition and on the glass in both games.  
“We can’t script everything,” head coach Andy Enfield said after the 85-80 loss to Arizona. “We can’t say we want Elijah to shoot this many or Onyeka to shoot — you just have to play basketball as a team and when it’s your turn hopefully you shoot a high percentage.” 
The Huskies’ ability to shut down USC’s offense led to Washington’s blowout over USC in January. The Trojans’ put up a season low field goal percentage of 20%, going only 13-65 from the field. Star freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu managed only 10 points in the loss — six under his season average — yet he led his team in scoring that game.
Since the teams’ last meeting, Washington has experienced its fair share of struggles. After blowing out USC, the Huskies have lost six of their last seven conference games at the hands of Stanford, Cal, Oregon, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. 
The slump has dropped the Huskies to the bottom of the Pac-12 standings with an abysmal conference record of 2-9.
Much of the Huskies’ struggles can be attributed to the loss of star sophomore guard Quade Green. Green was a sophomore transfer from perennial powerhouse Kentucky who was averaging 11.6 points and 5.3 assists for a Husky team that looked promising for much of the season. After scoring 14 points against USC in the victory against USC, the NCAA ruled Green academically ineligible for the rest of the season. 
The game won’t be a cakewalk for the Trojans though. They’ll have to stop freshman forward and first round prospect Isaiah Stewart, who has been playing exceptionally in the paint and leads the team with up to 18 points and nine rebounds per game. 
The Trojans will rely heavily on their veterans, who have been hot for the Trojans of late. Senior guard Jonah Mathews now averages 13 points per game after going 5-9 from beyond the arc against Arizona State and scoring 22 points. The recent road trip was also a chance for senior forward Nick Rakocevic to step up, as he had an impressive 18 point performance in a close 85-80 loss against Arizona and a team-high 12 rebounds against ASU.
Thursday’s game will be critical in determining the Trojans’ outlook in the Pac-12. Look for Washington to come out with the same defensive toughness that helped achieve their blowout last time, but don’t underestimate the adjustment period that the past month has offered for USC’s freshmen to get accustomed — especially Okongwu and forward Isaiah Mobley.
Both teams will be hungry to break their losing streak, as the Huskies bring a six-game skid into Thursday’s contest. USC’s 9-2 record at home may suggest an advantage for the Trojans, but its last home game against Colorado proved winning at Galen Center is no guarantee. 
USC will tip off against Washington at Galen Center at 6 p.m. Thursday after a jersey retirement for former Trojan and current San Antonio Spur Demar DeRozan.

The USC men’s basketball team has had its share of ups and downs this season. Prior to Pac-12 play, the Trojans started off the season 11-2 and looked like one of the more dominant teams in the conference.
For a team that has not won the Pac-12 regular season championship outright since 1984, USC’s start to the conference schedule was an encouraging sign. However, since that hot start, the Trojans have hit a wall.
After dropping three straight games, USC’s conference record sits at 6-5 and puts the team at fifth place in the Pac-12. The slump means USC is now firmly on the bubble to make the NCAA Tournament. In basketball analyst Andy Katz’s recent bracket prediction, the Trojans are listed as one of first four out of the tournament.
If the Trojans can turn things around, make a deep run in the Pac-12 Tournament and qualify for March Madness, here are the games that will matter most for the Trojans down the stretch. 
USC at Colorado (Feb. 20)
After playing its next two games against Washington and Washington State, USC will travel to Boulder to take on the No. 16 Colorado Buffaloes. In their last meeting, Colorado throttled USC in a 78-57 blowout. Since that game, Colorado has taken full possession of first place in the Pac-12.
However, with only two games separating the Trojans and the Buffs, USC has a chance to regain some critical ground in the conference with a win. After going 5-16 from beyond the arc during their last matchup, look for head coach Andy Enfield’s Trojans to improve and play a much closer game this time around.
It’s no secret that road wins are critical when it comes to Selection Sunday. USC has just four road wins on the season, and none against particularly tough opponents. A win over the Buffaloes in Boulder would boost the Trojans’ March Madness odds a considerable amount. If they can’t get it done, it will be tough to convince anyone this team can win tough games away from Galen Center. 
USC vs Arizona (Feb. 27)
USC will take on the Arizona Wildcats in their third to last game of the season at Galen Center. In a season that has been filled with nail-biters for the Trojans, this game has all the makings of another thriller. 
This is because USC came all the way back from a 20-point deficit in its last game against the Wildcats, narrowly missing out on its chance to improve on their conference record and give itself a crucial road victory against a ranked opponent. 
To make matters even more interesting, Arizona is currently in fourth place in the Pac-12, while USC stands at fifth. If both teams remain around these positions until they face each other, the rematch could have even bigger implications. 
The top four teams in the Pac-12 receive a bye in the first round of the conference tournament. This could go a long way in improving USC’s chances of making a late-season push to get invited to the NCAA Tournament. The further the Trojans can go in Las Vegas, the better their chances will be of earning a spot in March Madness — obviously, a first-round bye will have plenty of implications on their ability to make a deep run in the conference tournament.
USC vs Arizona State (Feb. 29) 
This game could very well decide who gets the fourth seed in the Pac-12 and starts the festivities off in Vegas with a first-round bye. The Sun Devils really only have one other tough game left on its schedule: a home bout with the Ducks. If they can take care of business in the rest of in six other games not against the Ducks or Trojans, USC will need a win to keep pace. 
After the two teams’ last matchup — a heartbreaking 2-point loss in Tempe that the Trojans had control of late in the game — it’s hard to believe USC can’t turn things around and pick up a win in front of what will figure to be a rowdy Saturday night crowd at Galen Center. If the Trojans can bounce back from that game and pick up a leap day win, their prospects for that coveted first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament will look much more promising. 
With only seven games left in the regular season, USC has to get back on track if it has any hope of returning to the NCAA Tournament. USC’s best shot at making March Madness is if they win most of their remaining games and play to a top-four finish in the Pac-12 Tournament. From here on out,every game is going to be crucial for the team and its fans down the stretch.
