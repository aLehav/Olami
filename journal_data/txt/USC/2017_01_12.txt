I finished the journal I’ve been keeping since I was 17 this week. The last page of writing was basically a love letter to the book itself. I made a list of all the things it survived. Then I read through past entries. In one, I described uncontrollable itchiness and napping two or three times a day — symptoms I did not yet recognize yet as lymphoma.
In another, I talked about realizing that I was not having stomach problems: I was actually purging. Then, out of the 200 pages and four years of writing, the rest was mostly about boys. I want to learn not to be ashamed of that.

I have catalogued my romances, in all forms, through the years. I don’t think I wrote about every date or even every kiss, but then again, for years there were a lot of boys I never got around to doing either with. What gets to me is that every time I started telling these stories, even up to a few months ago, I wrote, “Here I go again,” or, “You know what I’m about to say.”
I’m 21, and I have been in love three times. I am in love right now. I know that I fall easily and I even fall fast. When it comes to more casual encounters, I can’t extricate physical feeling from emotional feeling. I am learning to be proud of that. I’m so grateful for having started a habit at age 10 of writing secrets down every once in a while. I just hope that I can grow to take the judgment out of the space that is the most truly my own.
When I start my next journal, my goal is to forgive myself more. Every time I read, “Here I go again” in my own handwriting, I feel the criticism. Even in the privacy of a book that no one else will ever read, I reprimanded myself for being “boy crazy.” Who cares? 
I no longer want to cast my thoughts aside when they are that important to me. It’s true that one day I might look back at love notes to boys of my past and laugh or even cry. But I can’t protect myself from that now, so I’m going to continue putting words onto a page.
Once, when I wanted to do something really special, I sent my ex-boyfriend a journal entry I had written about him early in our relationship. A year later we imploded, but at that moment I shared with him my early dreams of walking down the aisle. In spite of all the pain to come, showing him these words was intimate, terrifying and worthwhile. Moments like that are why I write about love.
My own words haunt me when they describe the onset of my cancer or flashbacks to emotional abuse I had not yet recognized. But where else will I find such an untouched record of my life? My entries about love and 
relationships aren’t 
particularly poetic, but they remind me I’m capable of incredible things. 
I wrote on the last page of the 
journal that I hope I never misplace it. When I started writing down my feelings at age 10, I knew from the onset I wanted to show it to 
my future daughter. Well, that’s impractical now because I write about sex sometimes. 
However, I can still see myself pulling out the tattered purple book every once in a while to teach her, perhaps, the joys of letting yourself feel emotions deeply and running headfirst into them. She’ll laugh at me, I’m sure. But I want to try to help keep her from the hurt of repressing or judging her own heart.
I heard recently about a 60-year-old man looking through his 40 years of journal entries for career inspiration. I hope I can similarly teach future me a thing or two about love.
And I hope I stop writing “you know what I’m about to say” when a new partner enters my life. 
Every time is different. And I have a lot of stories. I’m excited to spend this semester telling them to you, with all of the befores and afters and everything in between.

Coming off the heels of the Golden Globes last weekend, various television networks are announcing the return of some of their most anticipated shows. TV giants like ABC, the CW and Freeform are picking up right where they left off in current seasons while adding new shows to their programs. From child-bearing virgins to surgeons from Seattle to high school heartthrobs, viewers’ favorite characters will return to air this month.
Jane the Virgin – Jan. 23 (The CW)
Last year’s Golden Globe Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy TV Series Gina Rodriguez returns as Jane Villanueva in the satirical telenovela. Having been accidentally artificially inseminated by her boss, Rodriguez’s character juggles motherhood with her relationships, work and family values rooted in her Latina heritage and Catholic upbringing. The CW announced earlier this month that the show was renewed for a fourth season, meaning fans can continue to follow Jane’s drama-filled, heart-wrenching future.
Quantico – Jan. 23 (ABC)
While some say Priyanka Chopra sparkled at this year’s Golden Globes, others say she shined in her role as Alex Parrish on the drama thriller. An FBI recruit training at the Quantico headquarters in Virginia, Chopra’s character fights to clear her name from a terrorist attack she is linked to while saving the lives of others. 
Suits – Jan. 25 (USA)
This thriller follows college dropout Mike Ross, played by Patrick J. Adams, working at Pearson Hardman, one of the hottest law firms in Manhattan, while his boss Harvey Specter covers up the fact that he has no law degree. 
Ross’ intelligence and eidetic memory guides him as he and his boss work on the firm’s cases together. While one of the recurring characters left the show in the middle of the sixth season, Suits will continue to surprise its audience with even more shocking twists.
Riverdale – Jan. 26 (The CW)
The CW is bringing the characters from the Archie comics to life in its newest mystery teen drama Riverdale, starring K. J. Apa as Archie Andrews, the show’s main heartthrob, with Cole Sprouse as his co-star. The plot pursues high schoolers in the wake of one of their classmates’ deaths, but the secrets revolving around his passing trouble this small, reserved town as danger lurks around every shadowy corner. The show’s premiere succeeds the 75th anniversary of the Archie Andrews character.
Photo from ABC Kept in suspense · ABC, the CW and Freeform are starting the new year off with suspense, picking up with a new season where they left off on shows like Jane the Virgin, Grey’s Anatomy and Suits.
 
Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder – Jan. 26 (ABC)
Shondaland Productions has the ball rolling with the return of USC alumna and creator Shonda Rhimes’ three hit shows. Grey’s fans will catch up with Meredith Grey, played by Ellen Pompeo, and her fellow surgeons in the medical drama, which is still “one of the network’s longest running and most successful current scripted series,” according to Entertainment Weekly. 
Kerry Washington returns as Olivia Pope, a former White House media consultant who opens up her own crisis-management firm in Scandal. However, Washington’s character only digs herself deeper into crisis as the season teaser calls for an explosive return to television after 252 days of being off the air. 
Lastly, Emmy Award-winning actress Viola Davis completes the female-headed trio with How to Get Away with Murder, featuring Davis’ character as a criminal law professor who, alongside her students, involves herself in a progressive murder plot to try to accomplish the deed of the show’s title. 
Despite the week-long delay of these airings due to ABC’s Presidential inauguration special, Rhimes’ productions will heighten viewers’ excitement with the shocking revelations each show promises to not hold back for much longer. 
The Fosters  – Jan. 31  (Freeform)
Another drama set to return on air, The Fosters centers on a complex family dynamic of “a lesbian couple and their blend of biological, adoptive and foster children,” according to IMDB. The show exhibits many LGBTQ and racial themes, and its upcoming 100th episode in season five promises to be another focal point.
Switched at Birth – Jan. 31 (Freeform)
Like its fellow Freeform production The Fosters, Switched at Birth follows Bay Kennish and Daphne Vasquez, who were accidentally switched as infants in the hospital. As one lives with a wealthy family and the other is deaf and raised by a single, middle-class mother, the girls and their families struggle to live in harmony, but for the sake of family, continue to seek out a balance in this family drama.

At the first Undergraduate Student Government meeting of the semester on Tuesday, USG senators voted to change the name of the Women’s Student Assembly to the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment. Although it seems like a simple cosmetic fix, this step is worthwhile in USC’s continuing effort to make students of all gender identities feel comfortable on campus.
SAGE was founded in 1990 to “raise the awareness, impact and voices of those oppressed by the patriarchy” and work toward “intersectional, collective liberation.” As one of nine assemblies within the USG Program Board, it works to organize events that discuss issues of sexual violence, body image and feminism and to influence campus culture. Considering these stated goals, the name change is quite logical. 
SAGE’s name aligns the group better with its stated aims; and besides, it was always a little bit silly to have a special interest group named for women when women make up over half of the student population. Using the term “gender empowerment” shows that the group is less dedicated to any specific gender and is more concerned about issues surrouding the patriarchal system. The group of those “oppressed by the patriarchy” would not only include cisgendered women, but also everyone who lives outside of the heteronormative expectations for gender, such as transgender men and women and those who decide to live outside of the gender binary. One could even argue that cisgender men are “oppressed by the patriarchy” on some level because they are also affected by issues like poor body image and a culture of sexual violence that stems from the patriarchal system. In this way, the organization is truly inclusive of all genders.
The decision to shift the stated focus of one of the University’s most prominent student interest groups is a reflection of the power of student voices. USC’s efforts to be welcoming and supportive of all gender identities have become increasingly apparent, beginning with the expansion of gender-neutral bathrooms and continuing with introduction of gender-neutral student housing. A new name for the only gender-focused assembly is just the next logical step toward a gender-inclusive campus. 
A name can only go so far, though. To see any real change on the issues of gender inclusion and empowerment, students should heed the message of SAGE and consider the myriad  of harmful ways that patriarchy affects them, regardless of their own genders. Patriarchy can reveal itself in small ways, like the specific expectations of male and female behavior that leave men afraid to show weakness and women unable to showcase ambition. Research from Columbia University has shown that these subtle biases lead to a classroom environment in which male students dominate the discussion, despite the female majority in higher education. This results in a lack of confidence in many female students. Though the research did not address those who are not cisgender, the influence of male dominance on their academic performance would surely be similar, if not more, pronounced in the classroom. 
Once the campus community can accept that patriarchy is a factor in their lives, it can begin the work to change it. Actions like adding gender-inclusive bathrooms, housing and signage are a fine start, but openness and inclusivity come from the individual level, not the institutional. It doesn’t seem like a radical act to simply be kind and respectful about issues of gender and sexuality, but in today’s fraught climate, it truly is. SAGE’s name signals that the campus is ready for dialogue and action on these issues, and it is now the responsibility of individual students to pursue just objectives. 
What is the main purpose of gender empowerments?

On Tuesday night, President Barack Obama delivered a bittersweet farewell address. After eight years as a poised, prepared and conscientious president, it is hard to think back to Obama as the young, springy senator who spoke of  hope so very long ago. But perhaps, deep down, hope had been his mantra since his time as a teenager from Honolulu. The question we should be asking, though, is whether Obama’s story in 1975 could really be recreated for a millennial in 2017. Unaffordable housing, skyrocketing student debt, rising rates of stress, depression and anxiety and the promise that they will be the first generation to make less than their parents — this is the environment that will have characterized Generation Y. 
Kimberly Hui | Daily Trojan
Students today are pressured to choose only the most practical paths in life. Many were raised to practice a dogma of cynical pragmatism in which playing it safe is the only way to play. We dare not dream of the wild success on the silver screen, seek to master the arts, express an inner voice or aspire to the Oval Office. Balance in life is seen as hedonism. As the semester begins anew, we must consider here at USC whether we are encouraged to entertain the thought that that Commander-in-Chief might just one day be us. We must become the generation that believes in our own ability — our ability to become the audacious, self-affirmed brats that many older citizens have been so delighted to say we are. 
At his commencement address in 2015, President C.L. Max Nikias told USC’s newest group of freshmen, “If you feel very special to be here … it’s because you are.” There can be no doubt that the University attempts time and time again to ingrain in its students the idea that their greatness, their wild success or big dreams are tangible with the right guidance, proper work ethic and good decisions. The science department works to put Trojans in Google and NASA. The School of Cinematic Arts gets Trojans on the big screen. The Unruh Institute places Trojans in the marble-topped capitols of Sacramento and Washington, D.C. 
But money is required to make money, as any indebted college student knows. As one millennial told Vice, “I had to leave a really great internship — an internship I was supposed to be doing as part of my studies — because I couldn’t afford to work for free.” Another: “You lose your drive because you get into this routine where you feel you can’t get away from your responsibilities, or your debt, or take risks.” 
The sad truth is that a stagnating economy with stunted job growth doesn’t play well with rising costs of higher education — all but absolutely necessary for employment — and corresponding rates of student debt. Millennials are entering the workforce at a time when a Republican Congress seems almost to delight in the shrinking middle class, and pays lip service rather than instituting policy. The Affordable Care Act insured millions of Americans not previously able to afford health care, many of them millennials — and lowered costs for thousands of others. It’s no surprise that the Trump administration has decided it will be first on the chopping block. Progress, it seems, is too terrifying. 
In light of the incoming administration, is this an era in which hope for a wildly successful future, for the achievement of one’s dreams, could actually survive?  It appears that the necessity to be employed in any capacity to pay off debt chokes innovation — and dreams of a preferable future. 
The most obvious solution, and perhaps the most effective one, would benefit young people entering the workforce as much as those already within it: grow and foster the middle class with common-sense progressive legislation. We should seek to move the nation forward in order to compete with its European counterparts with regards to affordable healthcare, education and housing. We must force large-scale corporations to work in the interests of their employees instead of their executive boards. We must quit ignoring the refusal of the wealthy to pay their fair share. 
But in order to make the change that many wished for — even as recently as in the 2016 Presidential election — college students must believe, collectively and wholeheartedly, that they have the ability to do so. There can be no room for the apathy that characterizes our politics. Millennials must be optimistic. Each student has the potential to be the springy senator giving speeches in the cold of Iowa in 2008. 
The University is a few days into the new semester, and an endless stream of myriad to-do lists begin to flow once more, for everyone. Students can only hope that it’s all really working toward something meaningful, successful and enjoyable — that we can still afford, on top of everything, to dream. 
Believe in yourself wholeheartedly, narcissistically — refuse to play it safe. Don’t leave the world without changing it.

With games against Oregon and Oregon State, both strong in their own ways, the women’s basketball team will have to find a way to tackle both teams in order to protect their home court and advance their record.
“Oregon is a very high-scoring team, and they have a lot of offensive weapons,” associate head coach Beth Burns said. “Oregon State is a little bit different. They are arguably one of the two best defensive teams in the league.”
After winning at home last year, USC was defeated in its second meeting against Oregon. This year, the two currently hold the same record in conference play at 1-3. On the other hand, the Beavers come to Galen Center undefeated in conference play with a five-game win streak against USC. However, the Women of Troy are not focusing on keeping the opponents’ records from distracting them from their goal.
“I think most importantly we’ve got to improve ourselves,” Burns said. “Sometimes you get so caught up in what Oregon does or what Oregon State does that we forget what USC does.”
While both teams will challenge the Trojans, one of the biggest struggles that the team has to overcome is inconsistency. With five freshmen and only two returning seniors, the Women of Troy are battling to overcome their youth and continue to improve with each practice and every game.
“I think about the only thing consistent with a young team is inconsistency,” Burns said. “From one game to the next that has been our biggest challenge. It’s a process.”
Still early in conference play, the Trojans are looking to use their youth to their advantage. None of the freshmen have played against Oregon or Oregon State, meaning their opponents will not be completely certain of what they can expect, even with game footage and scouting. Youth can only go so far in this league, though.
“When you play somebody twice with a young group, you have the opportunity to sneak up on someone the first games, but not the second game,” Burns said. “By the end of the year in league, the preparation of the group has evolved to where you learn plays in December, you run plays in January, and you’ve got to make plays in February and March.”
The younger players have the ability to learn from veterans like senior guards Courtney Jaco and Alexis Lloyd. With their guidance and the examples they set — along with the coaching staff — the players are not only preparing for more than just this season, but also for the longevity of their careers at USC. 
“I really credit Courtney Jaco,” Burns said. “She is just a true Trojan because as an older player, sometimes she has to be really patient for 15 minutes of something that she can do in her sleep. We have to have a fine balance every day of fundamentals; how to pass, how to shoot, how to catch and how to prepare to be a Trojan, to be a champion.”
The Women of Troy will take on Oregon on Friday at 8 p.m. and Oregon State on Sunday at 3 p.m. 
   I don’t think it honestly matters much if any at all whether or not who is coaching the Trojans Women’s Basketball Team this season because teams like Oregon State, Stanford, Oregon, and Washington are much to good for USC at this point in time. Actually, I’d be willing to wager a pretty hefty bet that it’ll be Oregon State winning both the regular season conference title as well as the post season conference tournament title also. They’re definitely loaded with the exact make up and mixture of player’s possessing the capabilities and talents to rise above the competition which coincidentally is exactly what I said about them last season except that it’d take a team as great as UConn to knock off the Beaver’s during March Madness post season tournament play last spring. However, it’s becoming all that much more apparent that this season’s squad is destined to become better than they’d been last time out on their magnificent run to the Final Four.
Where do you start with this program.?  Obviously Cooper is not the coach to get them to the promised land with her
recruiting and hard line approach to winning. The same old story year to year with mediocre results. Sorry to say Beth
Burns has not provided any difference in supposed defensive strength hired to accomplish. Attendance shows the
contempt for the women basketball game played at the Galen Ctr. which was promoted as a venue to draw better athletes
to the program. Time for AD Swann to wake up and be an athletic director to pull the plug on this coaching staff.

We told you so!
The Trojan family is still basking in post-Rose Bowl glory. All of our kicking and screaming late in the season feels validated after the epic victory in Pasadena — USC is one of the best teams in the nation, and redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold is the real deal. And you can’t help but wonder what heights this team could have hit if it had taken Washington or Ohio State’s place in the College Football Playoff.
On Monday night, the rest of the country finally caught up to what most of us in Troy already knew, and USC was ranked No. 3 in the 2016-17 season’s final AP Poll. I don’t need to rehash the already overtold story of Darnold’s meteoric rise; the team that won the Rose Bowl is clearly not the same team that Alabama humiliated in Arlington to open the season. These Trojans deserve the No. 3 ranking, and I guarantee you they believe they could top national champions Clemson — or Alabama for that matter — if the schools played each other this weekend. Would you dare bet against USC in either matchup?
But alas, this season is over, and the Trojans who charge onto the Coliseum field to take on Western Michigan in September’s opener will not be the same group that morphed into world-beaters last fall. Yet, next season’s squad will likely receive the windfall from this year’s turnaround. It wouldn’t be surprising to see USC well inside the preseason top 10, a prospect that should worry Trojan fans.
Columnist Luke Holthouse reminisced about the football program’s glory days in Wednesday’s column, and you can’t fault him for hoping this Rose Bowl victory will be a stepping stone toward returning to that golden age. But I can’t help but remember what happened in 2015, the last time USC entered a season as a trendy playoff pick.
Going into Steve Sarkisian’s second year as head coach, the Trojans were flying high with — no joke — Heisman candidate quarterback Cody Kessler and sophomore superstars JuJu Smith-Schuster and Adoree’ Jackson. They thumped Arkansas State and Idaho at home to start the season, climbing to No. 6 in the AP poll.
We all know how that story ended. USC came up short in a Week 3 shoot-out against Stanford and went on to lose to Washington as well in Week 5. Sarkisian was fired after that game, and the Trojans finished the season with an 8-6 record and a Holiday Bowl loss to Wisconsin. In retrospect, it is painfully obvious that the team missed stalwart nose tackle Leonard Williams, as well as Kessler’s favorite receiving target, Nelson Agholor (both players were taken in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft). The Sarkisian scandal didn’t help, but that wasn’t what sank the 2015-16 campaign. The talent was overestimated. Kessler wasn’t really a premier college quarterback; no receiver emerged to complement Smith-Schuster in the passing game.
The outlook for 2017 shares eerie parallels. USC will enter Clay Helton’s second season as full-time head coach having lost a star receiver to the draft. And while he may not be Leonard Williams, you can’t dismiss the loss of nose tackle graduate transfer Stevie Tu’ikolovatu, who transformed the Trojans’ defensive line during his single graduate season in Los Angeles. USC also will graduate both of its starting offensive tackles, senior Zach Banner and senior Chad Wheeler, and junior guard Damien Mama will depart for the NFL, robbing Darnold of valuable pocket protection.
Oh, yeah, and Adoree’ might be leaving. As Trojan fans, we must prepare ourselves for the forgone conclusion that our dynamic     jack-of-all-trades will be on his way to the professional level this spring. How can USC replace a player that was somehow a home-run threat on offense, defense and special teams? It’s an impossible task, but the need to replace Jackson’s presence in the return game and at cornerback is another daunting challenge for the Trojans’ upcoming season.
But still, despite the negatives, this particular team feels different, like it’s immune to these setbacks — and that confidence starts under center. Does Darnold need weapons, or does he make weapons? Without Agholor, Kessler couldn’t turn any receiver into a threat, instead feeding Smith-Schuster throughout his senior season. Smith-Schuster racked up a team-leading 1,454 receiving yards in 2015; Jackson was second-best with 414.
Darnold, on the other hand, made a star out of sophomore slot receiver Deontay Burnett, and the tight-end duo of redshirt freshman Daniel Imatorbhebhe and sophomore Tyler Petite emerged as legitimate red-zone targets. Senior Darreus Rogers was Darnold’s man in the upset victory at Washington. Senior De’Quan Hampton caught two huge touchdown passes when the Trojans rolled over UCLA. Smith-Schuster was still the focal point of the passing game, leading USC in receptions, yards and touchdowns (and making perhaps the biggest play of the Rose Bowl with his spectacular one-handed grab late in the game), but you don’t get the sense that Darnold will be lost without him.
Every once in a while, you stumble across a player who flat-out raises the level of play of those around him. Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers jump to mind — and there is a reason the latter is a popular comparison for Darnold. The freshman may just be one of those rare gems: unflappable, unstoppable and simply spectacular. If USC has a tendency to get caught up in preseason puffery (see: 2012 and 2015), Darnold’s even-keel persona could be the antidote that reverses that trend.
So while we Trojans would be smart to temper our expectations for next year, you can’t blame many of us for looking ahead with bright eyes, still soaking in the miracle that was the 2016-17 season. It may take an inhuman effort from Darnold and company for USC to live up to the hype next fall. But we’ve already seen crazier.

The men’s volleyball team protected their home court against previously undefeated Long Beach State after battling it out in four sets to advance their record to 2-2. While the 49ers forced a fourth set and stayed with the Trojans throughout most of the set, USC fought until the victory was theirs.
“I will never be satisfied until I’m done with what we are trying to do,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said to the Pac-12 Network. “I love winning and that’s the whole reason why we put in all this effort and time.”
Before the game, Nygaard challenged his team to focus more on their own game instead of Long Beach State’s record or stats. For him, it was more about what they would do on their side of the net than trying to control what the 49ers were doing. After some close losses, that focus and perseverance paid off.
“I don’t see the other side of the net differently,” Nygaard said. “I look at my team and I say, ‘If we do what we need to do on our side of the net, we can beat anybody.’”
USC started off the match strong  in the first two sets, leading for almost the entirety of both. After getting down early in the third set, however, the Trojans were never able to come back, despite cutting the lead in half.
The fourth set saw the two teams exchanging points back and forth, with neither team able to pull ahead until a block by senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder spurred a run by USC that essentially clinched the game.
Yoder led the team with a total of 28 kills, which was more than both of Long Beach State’s top two hitters’ kills combined, which totalled up to 23. Not only is he making the plays to keep his team in the game, but also forcing teams to find a way to stop him, which has been shown yesterday to be a difficult task given his stats in the last couple of games.
The performance came off a series of team-leading performances for Yoder. He recorded 33 kills in the team’s loss to Penn State on Saturday, coming only three shy of the school rally scoring era match record set at 36 by Brook Billings. The senior has been a leader for all four of his years with the program, and he continues to set the bar high for outside hitters on Nygaard’s squad.
“He played at a level that was, for what I think of his ability, at the standard,” Nygaard said. “I think that is what he is capable of on a consistent basis.”
A key to the victory for the Trojans was the ability to counter Long Beach State’s star sophomore outside hitter TJ DeFalco. Throughout the team’s first three shutout victories, DeFalco led the team with 37 kills. He continued in rhythm against USC, notching 13 kills, but that performance was outweighed by Yoder’s continued success on the attack.
Ultimately, the Trojans outplayed the 49ers in almost every category, with more kills, more assists, more blocks and more digs. The victory evened out the season’s record for the Trojans, who struggled against other top-ranked teams in their last two games. 
The season was stacked to be challenging from the start — the Trojans traveled to No. 1 Ohio State and then took on No. 14 Penn State at home, leading to back-to-back losses. With a win against No. 3 Long Beach State, however, the team is beginning to right itself and steer in the direction that Nygaard hopes to see each game, no matter which opponent his team is facing up against.
While each individual play adds up to make these totals happen, Nygaard stresses that one play does not win a game. He believes that his team’s success comes from the perseverance throughout in which every play is treated as the key to victory.
“Any game is important,” Nygaard said. “I don’t look at anybody as a matchup like it’s anything special. Every game is important. Every point is important. There’s no such thing as a big point.”
USC will look to build off of this victory as they take on Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. at the  Galen Center on Saturday.
A surprisingly good win. Confidence was gained with five set loss to Penn St. , and applied to victory over CSLB.
Yoder back to his freshman year of great promise. He really was not a leader in his sophomore year with injuries,
 and being in the dog house with Coach Ferguson. Team is a far cry from last season so far.

Five USC football seniors accepted invitations to pre-draft exhibition games on Tuesday. Offensive tackle Zach Banner and defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu will play at the Reese’s Senior Bowl on Jan. 28 in Mobile, Ala.
The game features some of the top seniors in the nation and acts as a chance for NFL scouts and coaches to take a closer look at potential draft picks. The Cleveland Browns and Chicago Bears’ coaching staff will take the reins of the South and North team, respectively. Banner was a captain on the 2016-17 USC squad and held down the right tackle position all year. Tu’ikolovatu was a graduate transfer this fall but made a huge impact in his sole season at Troy, taking home defensive MVP honors in the Rose Bowl.
One state south of Banner and Tu’ikolovatu, running back Justin Davis, tight end Taylor McNamara and safety Leon McQuay III accepted invitations to the East-West Shrine Game, which will take place on Jan. 21 in St. Petersburg, Fla. Davis began the 2016-17 campaign as the starting running back before injury sidelined him for three games. He finished the season with more than 700 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns. McNamara caught a lone touchdown this year to go with 111 receiving yards, and he caught the key two-point conversion in the third quarter of the Rose Bowl to pull USC within one score. McQuay also made a huge play in the “Granddaddy of Them All,” grabbing the late interception that set up the game-winning kick. He finished the season with 50 tackles, a sack and two picks.

USC football isn’t resting on its laurels after finishing the season ranked No. 3 in the AP poll. Four 2017 recruits enrolled at the University this semester, preparing to join the team for spring practice.
Jack Sears may be the highestprofile Trojan recruit of the bunch. The No. 8-ranked pocket passer in this year’s class, the San Clemente native flipped his commitment from Duke to USC in November, and he will join his former high school teammate Sam Darnold under head coach Clay Helton. Sears threw for 37 touchdowns (and just six interceptions) during his senior season and led his school to the CIF State 1-A championship.
Tayler Katoa is listed as a pocket-passer quarterback on ESPN, which is a testament to his versatility. The Layton, Utah native lined up under center, linebacker and defensive end at Layton High School and is expected to play linebacker for the Trojans. During his senior season, he recorded two sacks and a fumble recovery on defense, as well as 17 touchdowns on offense (14 rushing, three passing). Katoa could be a familiar name to Pac-12 sports fans, as his older sister, Eliza, is a junior outside hitter for the Utah women’s volleyball team.
Andrew Vorhees also arrives to beef up USC’s depleted offensive line. After graduating starting tackles Zach Banner and Chad Wheeler (and losing junior guard Damien Mama to the NFL draft), the Trojans will look for the Kingsburg, Calif. player to provide some much-needed depth in the trenches. Vorhees played on both sides of the ball during high school and was named All-Central Sequoia League Lineman of the Year in his senior year.
Finally, long snapper Damon Johnson comes to USC as one of the top-ranked recruits at his position. He will have big shoes to fill, taking the place of graduating four-year starter Zach Smith. Hailing from Glendora, Calif., he did not play football last fall while attending Citrus Junior College.
