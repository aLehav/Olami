This weekend the USC men’s volleyball team will take its talents to the Bay Area for its most challenging road trip of the season. The Trojans (7-4, 5-4) will be in Stockton Friday night to play No. 11 Pacific, and will turn around and head about 80 miles south to Palo Alto on Saturday to take on one of their toughest challenges of the season against top-ranked Stanford.
The Trojans have rebounded from their sweep against UCLA in dominating fashion, sweeping both Pepperdine and Hope International during a four-game home stand.
Though Stanford is ranked as the top team in the nation, the Trojans have defeated the Cardinal two of the past three years and are not daunted by the task.
“They’ve been a pretty similar team for the last two to three years. We’ve gone back and forth with them so this year is going to be really good. It’s going to be a close game” senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli said.
That is not to say a victory in Palo Alto is assured. “We need to be solid on the service line and limit our errors. We’ve worked a lot on blocking this week in practice in order to take away the good angles and good shots for the Cardinal” senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick said.
Additionally, this weekend will feature two of the most intense home crowds the Trojans will face all season. So while the intensity of both matches will be at a high level, the team is excited to play in such an atmosphere, especially at Stanford.
“You have to steal the energy from the crowd and embrace it,” Ciarelli said.
Despite their No. 6 national ranking, the team has been unimpressive in away games this season, going only 2-3, with one of those victories coming against a Division II squad in California Baptist. Despite losing a close five-set match to No. 3 BYU in Provo, Utah, the results have simply not being favorable for the Trojans away from the Galen Center.
Despite the attention being paid to Saturday evening’s matchup, the team is not looking past their Friday night foe in Pacific.
Shandrick was resolute about not taking the Tigers likely.
“We never take it easy,” Shandrick said. “Every team loves playing and beating USC and we don’t want that to happen.”

Just when you thought that the inauguration of President C. L. Max Nikias would bring an air of social and academic responsibility to our party-dome campus, a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority has decided to continue one of ‘SC’s stereotypes.
She has gone from simple college girl to national celebrity in a matter of minutes because of one email with the ever-present Ryan Seacrest.
It all started when she took out a Craigslist ad trying to find a date for her sorority’s annual Beauxs and Arrows invite. Her boyfriend, who according to her is a “hot douche,” dumped her a few days before the invite, leaving her dateless.
Seacrest decided he would fix her up with Derek Hough, a Dancing with the Stars champion and coincidently the brother of Seacrest’s girlfriend Julianne.
The student decided to get even because her ex-boyfriend “is a prominent person around campus, and I know no better way than to take [Derek] then to get back at him!”
She says that her date needs to “definitely over 6 feet (do not include height from hair), steamy and athletic build (6 pack highly preferred), sharp and classic fashion sense (absolutely no bow tie aficionados – think Clooney).”
Many have laughed along with her idea, saying that it means she has a fantastic sense of humor. But does no one see the larger picture? The sooner we give into people with materialistic and unrealistic ideals of beauty, the sooner the world stays in a stagnated place where beauty reigns all.
USC is a very “physical” campus. You will find people working out in the gym at all hours of the night, girls spending hours to put on make up and guys not eating carbs in order to “bulk up.”
Unlike James Franco’s series Undergrads, this is real. Although some have had their problems with the webseries, the fact that it knows it’s fictional is decent enough. But when stuff like this happens in real life, it’s no laughing matter.
you’ve got to be kidding me with this article… the entire craiglist ad was a COMPLETE JOKE .. it’s not her fault it happened to get her famous. people need to calm down and have a sense of humor once in a while. you’re probably just jealous of her. i completely agree with alex’s comment above.
also- you should proofread your articles before you publish them… “She says that her date needs to “definitely over 6 feet” ?
Pi Beta *Phi*
This was clearly meant to be humorous, stop taking things so literally and trying to spin them. This is simply nothing more than having a great sense of humor — there is no larger picture to be seen. You’re in the Greek system and I bet you wouldn’t have written this if the girl would’ve been in your sorority. Furthermore, is it really a bad thing that “USC” is a physical campus? Since when is staying in shape something to be ashamed of?

In a year where the nominations for best picture range from the feel-good The Help to the philosophical Tree of Life, the nominations for best original song remain disappointingly shallow.
For the 84th Academy Awards, only two songs were nominated for the category: Rio’s “Real in Rios” and The Muppet’s “Man or Muppet.” It’s not that either song is particularly awful —“Man or Muppet” is pleasantly surprising with its witty lyricism and catchy rock underscore— but compared to previous years, 2012 falls far short of its predecessors.
To be fair, the best original song category is usually hit-or-miss. Last year, many audience members were disappointed to see Tangled’s mediocre “I See the Light” score a nomination. And the year before, two songs from The Princess and the Frog were in the running with Crazy Heart’s “The Weary Kind,” pitting soulful fun against the mournful intricate.
Keeping in mind the past few years, the category of best original song seems to be growing more dependent on tracks from children’s films and musicals.
It’s a bit of an overstatement to say that family movie soundtracks are only recently gaining attention from the Academy. (After all, Alan Menken dominated the Oscars in the early 90s with songs like “Beauty and the Beast,” “A Whole New World,” and “Colors of the Wind.”) But there did use to be a larger presence of songs from films with a rating higher than “G.”
Take 1997, when Titanic’s “My Heart Will Go On” completely overshadowed Hercules’ “Go the Distance” and Anastasia’s “Journey to the Past.” Or rewind to 1987, where “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life” from Dirty Dancing grabbed an award in a year where no children’s films were nominated.
Now, however, it seems as though the category depends on family movies.
Formerly, big-name artists like Celine Dion, Stevie Wonder and Lionel Richie drew attention to the musical side of the Oscars, their memorable tracks stealing radio as well as screen time. In a field where a signature song has to match the lighting, editing, and overall tone of the film, big talent and hard work are often a requisite.
Instead, today’s top artists opt for soundtrack credit by letting a studio borrow an already successful song. Twilight’s bestselling album featured “Supermassive Black Hole” by Muse, which was released in 2006, a full two years before Twilight. In 2009, (500) Days of Summer highlighted Hall and Oates’ 1980 hit “You Make My Dreams”. It would appear that with a myriad of great songs already available, film studios and artists just aren’t as interested in collaborating.
In fact, only a few artists even come to mind when it comes to movie soundtracks. Carrie Underwood volunteered for “Ever Ever After” in 2007’s Enchanted, but the song didn’t garner a nomination. Leona Lewis’ work on Avatar’s “I See You” drew little recognition. In 2010, Miley Cyrus’ “When I Look at You” for The Last Song did well on the pop charts but got absolutely no support from the Academy.
Recent trends considered, it would seem that until studios and artists become more interested in making great soundtracks for great movies, the category of best original song will remain pretty uninspired.
 
It was not a surprise to me that the stupid muppet song won the oscar.
After all, the ones deciding wanted to “keep the oscar in the house”.
Saying that, due to the obvious favoritism and unfairness of this
Decision, I think that in a sense this was a positive lesson:
A) for Brazilians not to even waste money to travel to any oscar
Nomination since fairness is not present.
B) that the Brazilians should also apply the principle ” of keeping
Everything in the house” and travel less and expend less money in the
USA , and instead invest their money ” in the house” in the
Brazilian economy, so it can continue to flourish. Keep the money ” in the
House- in Brazil”.
