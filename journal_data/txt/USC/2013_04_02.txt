USC’s Black Student Assembly announced Tuesday that rapper Curren$y will headline this year’s Gearfest.
Shante Scott Franklin, who performs under the stage name Curren$y, has collaborated with multiple high-profile acts including Rick Ross and Wiz Khalifa. Known mostly for his mixtapes, Curren$y released his first studio album This Ain’t No Mixtape in 2009, receiving positive critical feedback. He performed at Coachella.
Lamar Gary, the executive director of BSA, said the organization chose Curren$y as a headliner because the artist embodies the traits that he hoped festival attendees would aspire to. He also represented Gearfest’s theme of “Dreamin’ of Destiny.”
“Curren$y fit the theme well because a lot of his music talks about upward mobility and being above the nonsense, which is all about the ‘Dreamin’ of Destiny’ theme,” Gary said. “Because he talks about that in his music and infuses elements of jazz and a chill vibe, he was the absolute best pick.”
Some students responded positively to the headliner selection.
“I like the fact that USC is showcasing upcoming artists. I’m excited to see the performance,” said Chris Raidy, a senior majoring in business administration.
The Gearfest concert and fashion show, which focuses on art and clothes representative of the various stages of the college experience, will be held jointly with Springfest for the first time this year.
Gearfest will also be featuring artists Rippy Austin and Rhyon Brown, as well as designers J.D Luxe, Chinyere and others. In past years, Jhene Aiko, Bruno Mars, Travie McCoy and Omarion have performed.
Gary said the act will offer attendees a cultural aspect to the festival.
“Gearfest is its own show within Springfest. It provides a deeper element of culture we wanted to bring to the student body,” Gary said.
Both events are slated to begin at 11:30 a.m. on April 6 on McCarthy Quad. Springfest headliners include Big Sean, A-Trak, Travis Barker and Mix Master Mike. Other performers include Walk the Moon, Capital Cities and Papa.
All students attending the festival will be required to show their student identification. Access to the festival is free.

Students from various cultral groups took the stage Tuesday to express themselves though poetry, prose and music.
“Risen and Released: A Night of Personal and Social Liberation” was an open mic night hosted at Ground Zero Performance Café by USC Students for Justice in Palestine. Collectively sponsored by other student organizations, the event promoted social justice and empowerment.
“Since the themes are social justice, discrimination and racism, we reached out to communities on campus that have some form of connection to that theme,” said Ifrah Sheikh, an SJP member and event coordinator. “We tried to reach a very broad spectrum of groups that we thought also deal with these issues within their group based on the demographic of people that they have.“
The event sponsors included Black Student Assembly, Women’s Student Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Services, Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, Muslim Student Union, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana de Aztlán de USC, Ansar Service Partnership, The Interloper Alternative Newspaper, USC Lebanese Club, Iranian Student Organization and Students Taking Action in the Name of Diversity.
The night featured Los Angeles poet Arash Saedinia, who read translated poetry of other Palestinian poets as well as his own works. Saedinia said he was thrilled by the diversity of participants and supporters and also felt a sense of contentment and purpose in being back at USC.
“I was really particularly excited because my father came to USC as a scholarship student, so my first memories of Los Angeles hold close ties to USC,” Saedinia said.
Saedinia not only read poetry that focused on Palestine, but also brought up issues in the United States and South Africa.
Kevin Steen, a senior majoring in Middle Eastern studies and linguistics, said he appreciated that Saedinia’s performance encompassed injustice as a whole.
“I really enjoyed all the poetry that Arash Saedinia read, especially since he made it more than just about Palestine or just one place -— that injustice anywhere effects injustice everywhere,” Steen said.
Steen also appreciated the parallels between historical injustices and current conflicts.
“I really like that he made it about connecting the United States and the apartheid in Israel and Palestine to the apartheid in South Africa and I think people need to see those connections more.”
Many student performed original pieces of poetry and prose.
Zade Shakir, a junior majoring in international relations and biological sciences, recited a poem he wrote in high school entitled “Speak” that highlighted the conflicting nature of freedom of speech.
“We have freedom of speech, but is our speech truly free?” Shakir said.
Sheikh said the night was successful but solemn and emotional.
“I think that the mic night is about really giving students an opportunity to show that what they have gone through is really significant. It’s not a little thing,” Sheikh said.  “The power of spoken word and art really brings people together in ways that a lecture can’t. That’s what I hope for tonight — that it will really bring people together in their honesty and vulnerability onstage.”
The occupation of the West Bank is placing young soldiers–who, as kids, were scarred by the Palestinian suicide campaign of the early 2000s–in a position where they daily chafe against the Palestinian population. It is not a good situation, and most Israelis know that. But it is not done because of racist motives.
After the very bad experiences Israel had withdrawing from Lebanon and Gaza, there is little appetite in Jerusalem now to unilaterally withdraw from the West Bank to the outskirts of Tel-Aviv.
The ongoing, vicious campaign to smear Israel as an Apartheid state because of that, is a patent attempt to force such a withdrawal despite the potential violence and terror that it is universally expected to afflict on Israel, as for instance, is depicted in Jonathan Bloomfield’s award-winning thriller, “Palestine.”

The view from Michael L. Jackson’s office shows the scope of his role as vice president for Student Affairs. From the second floor of the Student Union, Jackson can see tours of prospective students gather in front of Tommy Trojan or watch undergraduates zip down Trousdale Parkway on bikes.
This is it · Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson is set to step down in June. He will take a yearlong sabbatical in Hawaii. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In his 18 years at USC, Jackson has led a key department during a crucial time in the university’s history. Of course, Jackson knew this when President Emeritus Stephen B. Sample recruited him away from Stanford University.
“[Sample] stressed that we were going to push this institution forward and make it better than anyone thought it could be,” Jackson said. “Having been at Stanford, where they do that quite successfully, being given the opportunity to be part of an incoming team was very exciting for me.”
As the university produced more research, increased the number of graduate students and admitted more competitive applicants, Student Affairs had to adapt.
“When I first arrived, this was a commuter campus. We hardly had any night activities. We had students leaving in droves,” Jackson said. “Our six-year graduation rate was in the mid-60s, but now it’s closer to 92 percent. We didn’t have as many international students, and 75 percent of undergraduates were from Southern California.”
Student Affairs at USC includes departments ranging from El Centro Chicano to International Student Services and the Health Center and the Daily Trojan.
Under Jackson’s leadership, Student Affairs established the LGBT Resource Center, expanded the Center for Women and Men, revamped the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, added the Parents Programs Office and created the Kortschak Center for Learning, among myriad accomplishments.
While Jackson’s wide smile reveals a fatherly pride when he speaks of these programs, Jackson emphasized how it’s the students who come to USC  that really make the university better. Students have doubled the number of student organizations from about 400 to more than 800, and students have developed multiple leadership programs.
For example, since he arrived, the proportion of Greek students has increased from 12 to 20 percent while those students maintain a higher average GPA than the total student body. USC is one of 64 universities where this happens.
“Dr. Jackson has been an innovative and supportive leader who cares deeply about the student experience,” said  Denzil Suite, the associate vice president for Student Affairs. “The Trojan Family will not be the same without him.”
As the university has grown, so has the physical space used by branches in Student Affairs, prompting the construction of the Parkside Residence Hall, Arts and Humanities Residence Hall, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the Engemann Student Health Center.
“Those represent a collective effort and a real commitment to the student experience,” Jackson said. “They’re really saying to prospective students and their families that this is a serious place. We really take the student experience seriously and we want to provide a set of experiences and facilities that help students learn and figure out who they are.”
This fact is not lost on others in Student Affairs. Lynette Merriman, senior associate dean of students, said future students will benefit from Jackson’s legacy.
“Dr. Jackson’s career has been all about students — the student experience, their education and their developmental growth,” Merriman said. “It is hard to imagine the impact that he has had on so many young people’s lives. Through his compassion and commitment to students individually and collectively, the USC campus community has evolved into one that is admired throughout the country.”
Though Jackson has overseen a key division during a period of great change in the university, he remains humble about his accomplishments.
“I’m a firm believer in low ego and high results. That’s number one,” Jackson said. “It’s about finding great people and supporting them, really listening to them and encouraging them to take initiative.”
This emphasis on service, Jackson said, is inspired by those who mentored him.
“When I was a young man, other people helped me and they saw something in me,” Jackson recalled. “They helped me to develop my potential and to understand that I had a role to play in society.”
This has pushed Jackson to ensure Student Affairs always focuses on students.
“It’s really about creating an environment of success for students,” Jackson said. “As long as one keeps that at the core of what one is doing, it makes it easier to make decisions and figure out what the most important thing is.”
Though Jackson said there’s still work he would like to do at USC (such as increasing RecSport’s facilities), he’s ready to retire. After earning a bachelor’s degree at Stanford and a master’s and doctorate from University of Massachusetts Amherst, Jackson served as dean of students at Stanford University for eight years before coming to USC. All in all, Jackson has spent the last 40 years working in student affairs departments full time. He has been on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 26 years.
“That eventually wears you down a bit,” Jackson said. “Now, at the end of my time here, I’m nostalgic and I’m a bit sad because I’ve put so much into it, but I know I put as much into it as I can.”
Though Jackson will continue to teach at the Rossier School of Education and advise the university’s Office of International Services after a yearlong sabbatical, which he plans to spend in Hawaii with his wife, Jackson said he is excited to hang up his coat.
“The first few months, I’m going to do as much of nothing as I possibly can,” Jackson said. “I’ve been working every day for 40 years. I don’t know what it’s like to not work everyday.”
Jackson said he’s been honored to be part of the Trojan Family, even with all its highs and lows.
“There were a few bumps in the road here and there but, by and large, it’s really been a blast,” Jackson said. “There’s no better gift than being able to work at a place like USC.”
 
Correction: The printed version of this article stated that Jackson had been at USC for 26 years. Jackson has been at USC for 18 years but has served as a dean  or vice president of student affairs for 26 years. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The new president, vice president and Senate of the Undergraduate Student Government for the 2013-14 academic year were inaugurated Tuesday night after the final Senate meeting of the school year.
Inauguration · Chief Justice Jimmy Castrellon swears Christian Kurth in as Undergraduate Student Government President Tuesday. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After voting on the last items of unfinished business, the Senate meeting transitioned into the formal inauguration. Attendees dressed in formal attire for the occasion.
President-elect Christian Kurth, who previously served as the USG director of university affairs, and Vice President-elect Ryan Park, previously a Greek senator, were sworn into office by the Chief Justice Jimmy Castrellon after the new senators took their oaths. After being introduced by former USG President Mikey Geragos, Kurth delivered a speech outlining his goals for the upcoming term.
“We have been entrusted with the responsibility to help students feel at home on campus, to plan the greatest concert of their lives that they can enjoy with friends, to help them experience the culture of Los Angeles and to make sure their voices are heard by the administrations,” Kurth said in his inaugural speech.
During their campaign, Kurth and Park promised to create an ultimate myUSC smartphone app, increase library hours, repair sidewalks on The Row and encourage the participation of the entire student body in USG’s decisions.
“We want to help students understand what we do and why we do it, which is working to improve the USC undergraduate experience,” Park said. “We want students to rally around USG and use it as a voice to communicate [with] the administration.”
Park said his experiences as Greek Senator have prepared him for the vice presidency.
“Vice president is definitely going to be much more dynamic of a position, but I’ve learned a lot about the vice president’s responsibilities through osmosis by being on the Senate and learning from Vinnie [Prasad],” Park said.
In addition to the inauguration of the president and vice president, 12 senators were sworn into office.
Sophomores Nicole Schrad and freshman Logan Heley and junior Jamie Dick were inaugurated as Greek senators, while juniors Brett Ressler, Matthew Leiv and Lorin Winata were sworn into the positions of commuter senators.
Freshmen David Choi, Michael Nguyen and Samantha Cheng and sophomores Matthew Prusak, Brandon Chang and Brianna McRee were inaugurated to serve next year’s residential constituency in the Senate.
Park said that though the inauguration is an important event for transitioning the new officers, the process would be better carried out sooner.
“It’s essentially the passing of the torch between the old Senate and the incoming Senate, as well as the old president and vice president and the new ones,” Park said. “It’s more of a formality and should be done directly after we’re elected, in my opinion.”
Geragos and Prasad said they have mixed feelings about the conclusion of their administration, but are optimistic about the future of USG.
“It’s definitely bittersweet to pass the torch,” Geragos said. “I’ve had such an amazing time leading this organization and I will miss the work, but it has been a tiring process. It makes it a lot easier for me to pass it over knowing that I’m giving the presidency to one of my closest friends.”
Prasad said he will always cherish the relationships he built and the things he was able to accomplish during his term, but that he is ready to move on from USG and looks forward to watching Kurth and Park head the organization.
Prasad also offered words of advice for the newly inaugurated administration, encouraging them to forge connections with others as soon as possible.
“I’d advise them to take the time to build relationships early, both inside of the organization and outside,” Prasad said. “Those relationships are key to tackling the challenges that come up throughout the year and creating the best possible experience for the undergraduates.”
In his speech, Kurth said he would continue to follow in Geragos’ footsteps in striving to build lasting relationships. He concluded by expressing his eagerness to begin his term.
“I truly believe that this year will be the greatest year USG has ever seen,” Kurth said, “and I can’t wait to get to work.”
Does anyone bother reading these articles before they go to print?
“Sophomores Nicole Schrad and freshman Logan Heley and junior Jamie Dick were inaugurated as Greek senators, ”
1. That doesn’t make sense grammatically
2. Even if it did, Logan Heley is a sophomore

USC football player Marqise Lee announced Tuesday to a crowd of about 400 attendees, including multiple news outlets, that he would be not be returning to the football team this fall, and instead would join the USC basketball team.
However, Lee’s announcement was simply part of an annual prank held by the Skull and Dagger Society, the oldest all-unversity honor society.
April fools · The Skull and Dagger Society reveals their prank to students, faculty and news crews at Tommy Trojan on Tuesday afternoon. – Alexander Harsono | Daily Trojan
The prank, held in front of Tommy Trojan, served as an opportunity to announce the society’s new student members for 2013 and to commemorate the society’s 100th anniversary.
Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos introduced the event, which was advertised as a special announcement by the university. USC Song Girls performed to ‘Fight On!’ before football players Matt Barkley and Khaled Holmes  went on stage.
Barkley introduced Lee for his special announcement. Lee jokingly stated that he would play basketball in the 2014 season, a reference to the recent announcement of the hiring of Andy Enfield, the new USC basketball coach.
“I’ve now decided to actually quit football to pursue my dreams in basketball to play for Dunk City USC,” Lee said.
Holmes then approached the mic to assure the attendees that Lee was not serious.
“That’s not serious — not at all,” Holmes said. “I would like to announce much more important news — that it is the 100th anniversary of Skull and Dagger.”
Following the announcement, new members wearing black tuxedo tails and holding canes released fake $100 bills printed with the Skull and Dagger symbol and dropped a banner from the fourth floor balcony of the Gwynn Wilson Student Union building, across from Tommy Trojan.
The prank served as an informal initiation of the society’s newest members, who were selected for the fame and honor they brought to the university, according to a press release. Members of the society include student leaders from different university organizations and athletic teams.
The society, founded in 1913, selects students, staff, administrators and alumni to join each year.

The USC women’s golf team claimed its third consecutive victory on Tuesday at the San Diego State Farms Invitational in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
Junior Sophia Popov led the No. 1 Women of Troy, picking up her first individual title of the season with a solid 1-over 217. Though Popov finished just a stroke ahead of Arizona’s Manon Gidali to claim victory, her team had an easier time, defeating the second-place Wildcats by over 20 strokes.
Pepperdine, Texas and UNLV rounded out the top five, all finishing 29 strokes or more behind USC.
Such a large margin of victory can be attributed to all five of the squad’s golfers finishing in the top 10. Freshman Annie Park finished just two strokes behind Popov, good for third place, while freshman Kyung Kim and sophomore Doris Chen tied for fourth with a 5-over 221. Junior Rachel Morris tied for 10th with an 8-over 224.
The Women of Troy never trailed over the course of the three-day event, and victory seemed to be a sure thing from the beginning.
In Sunday’s opening round, Kim paced the squad with an even par 72, finishing right behind the individual leaders and helping the Trojans to a four-stroke lead.
Popov’s 3-under 69 in Monday’s second round helped extend that lead to 13 strokes and propelled her to the top of the individual leaderboard. Park and Chen each fired 1-under 71s in Tuesday’s final round to lead the team, while Popov held on for victory with a 2-over 74.
After three wins as a freshman and one last season, Popov’s first title of this season gives her five total, matching the USC record.
The Women of Troy also made history as a team, winning a third consecutive tournament for the first time in five years. The last time that occurred, during the 2008 season, the team brought home an NCAA championship.
The Women of Troy will next battle No. 13-ranked Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz. at the Ping/ASU Invitational beginning April 12. There, the team will try to close out the regular season with four consecutive victories, another feat previously accomplished only by the 2008 championship squad.

Like plenty of other college basketball fans who picked Georgetown to advance deep into the NCAA tournament, I quickly familiarized myself with Florida Gulf Coast University and its head coach, Andy Enfield. The FGCU Eagles disposed of the second-seeded Hoyas in surprisingly dominant fashion, then took down San Diego State (a team that beat USC during the regular season) before falling to the third-seeded Florida Gators.
Enfield and the Eagles are arguably the biggest story of March Madness. FGCU became the first 15-seed to make it to the Sweet 16, and did so with dozens of highlight-reel dunks. They played relentless, fearless basketball regardless of the talent level of their opponents.
And now, not even two weeks after FGCU’s improbable run began, Enfield is USC’s new men’s basketball coach.
When news of Enfield’s hiring first broke on Twitter Monday night, I was frankly disappointed. Two wins in the NCAA tournament was all it took to take the reigns of a program that was looking to reinvent itself as a force to be reckoned with in the Pac-12? What other qualifications did Enfield even have?
As the night wore on, more information on the hiring began to trickle in, and it quickly became apparent that Enfield’s background isn’t as sparse as many would be led to believe. He previously served as a shooting coach for the Milwaukee Bucks and was an assistant to Rick Pitino with the Boston Celtics along with Leonard Hamilton at Florida State University. That’s far from a star-studded resume, but it’s nothing to sneeze at, either.
My initial feeling of disappointment has since softened. On a very basic level, I’m content with the hire for three reasons.
One, because the Trojans probably couldn’t do much better. As fellow columnist Joey Kaufman pointed out to me over Twitter, USC wasn’t going to pull in Jamie Dixon from the University of Pittsburgh or Josh Pastner from the University of Memphis. People love to talk about USC being an ideal location for a basketball program — the city of Los Angeles, new arena, fancy athletic facility — but that’s yet to entice a big-time candidate. Until USC actually becomes an attraction for its play on the court, very little else matters.
Second, Enfield fits the mold of a low-risk, high-reward hire. If the Trojans were consistently knocking on the door of the NCAA tournament, then the risk would be greater for a guy who has only been a head coach for two seasons. But the Trojans were 6-26 a season ago. They were 14-18 this season. I highly, highly doubt Enfield will come in and send the program spiraling south. At the very least, his team will remain a middle-of-the-road squad in the Pac-12.
On the other end of the spectrum, Enfield is the type of youthful, creative coach who could reinvigorate athletic gunners like junior guard J.T. Terrell. He might be able to recruit better than expected. FGCU’s surprising finish in the NCAA tournament might not actually have been a fluke. Lots of ifs and mights, but the possibility is there.
Finally, Enfield appears to talk the talk of a coach who wants to do things differently. He issued a statement on Monday night promising to bring “an exciting, up-tempo style of play to USC [while] building the men’s basketball brand into one that the fans and basketball community will enjoy and respect.” At the very least, that will fill some empty seats at the Galen Center.
During a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, he went on to add, “I want my players to have fun. We enjoy ourselves. I believe in positive reinforcement.” Certainly a novel concept on the heels of the news that Rutgers head coach Mike Rice routinely physically and verbally abused his players during practice. Players want to play for coaches that treat them with respect. End of story.
So Haden didn’t strike out with this coaching search. From all indications, he did his due diligence with the biggest names in the sport, all of whom turned him down. Then Enfield’s team emerged as the darling of the NCAA tournament, and Haden pounced.
On some level, though, this move feels a bit calculated for the wrong reasons. Enfield is the sexy name. Plenty of media pundits have already declared USC the winner of the head-coaching search against rival UCLA, who went for the safer, more established choice with former New Mexico head coach Steve Alford. But it shouldn’t be about splashing headlines.
Yes, Enfield is a gutsy hire. Yes, his ceiling is higher than Alford’s. And yes, if you want people to start caring a little bit more about USC basketball, bringing in a guy whose old team was nicknamed “Dunk City” isn’t a bad idea. But it’s about the long-term, not the short-term.
I still maintain that Syracuse assistant coach Mike Hopkins would’ve been the best choice for the job. He has the pedigree that Enfield just doesn’t. He’s been Jim Boeheim’s understudy for 17 years and is in line to take Boeheim’s position when the legendary coach eventually calls it quits. And Boeheim made an interesting point when asked about USC’s coaching decision.
“People in those situations, they try to take a guy who is a head coach so they can say they hired a head coach,” Boeheim told Syracuse News.
That’s not all he said either.
“Mike is 10 times better than anyone they could have hired,” Boeheim added.
I want Enfield to prove him wrong, but I tend to trust the coach who has his team playing in the Final Four this weekend. Hopkins wouldn’t have excited the fanbase nearly to the same extent as the leader of the this year’s Cinderella squad, but he’d instantly legitimize the Trojans on a level that Enfield simply can’t, at least not yet.
That brings me back to my point. It’s not about pumping up the fans from the get-go, it’s about putting a winning squad on the court.
“We really want to and need to make basketball relevant at USC,” Haden told reporters during Tuesday’s conference call.
I just hope his idea of relevancy is creating a consistent, winning program, not just putting butts in seats.

I have never read this Blog before, it came up in my Google Alerts but as you can see I am a Nole who has been connected in a small way with FSU Basketball. I think you have a fine man with high standards which any program could use, he brings not junk to the job, I was sad to see him leave FSU and go to FGCU, but as the current football coach at Western KY said , you just rent a coach, they go where they can make the most $$.Perhaps the writes of the Blog are just wanting to start a conversation by the comments in the article but give Andy a chance look at the caliber of people in brings into the program and then come back next  April and see how he did his first year.
Uscdadnyc is not a Basketball Fan, but a grad of SU. When Hopkins interviewed at SC, I immediately thought of the SU- Darryl Gross- USC Connection. AD Haden’s final pick dispelled that thought.

In the battle of the bullpens Tuesday night at Dedeaux Field, USC was let down not by its pitching, but by its dormant bats in a 3-1 loss to UC Irvine.
Erratic performance · Sophomore pitcher Nigel Nootbaar (above) allowed two runs while walking three batters in three innings of work. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
All season long, the Trojan (11-17) bullpen has been the source of frustration and agony for head coach Dan Hubbs. His relievers have been inconsistent, unpredictable and generally representative of their youth. So it might have raised a few eyebrows when Hubbs deemed Tuesday’s matchup a “bullpen game.”
But while the ’pen came through for Hubbs, the Trojan bats did not.
Sophomore Nigel Nootbaar, the Trojans’ most reliable reliever for most of the season, started on the mound. He went three innings, surrendering three walks and hitting two batsmen, but escaped with only two runs allowed. Those two runs, however, proved to be all the Anteaters (17-8) needed.
“Nigel was pretty erratic,” Hubbs said. “And that’s disappointing, because we need him to be better.”
Both the Trojans and Anteaters finished with five hits apiece. Though Irvine only gave up two free base runners — one walk and one hit batsman — USC gifted nine free passes with six walks and three hit batters. And the Anteaters capitalized, as runners who reached via the walk scored two of their three runs.
“I felt like we gave them everything,” Hubbs said. “They did nothing offensively. So it’s disappointing to lose a game like that.”
After getting double-digit hits in their last four games, USC came away with just five against Irvine. Evan Brock went four complete innings for Irvine, allowing just three hits and one run. The Anteater bullpen came in strong behind him, tossing five full innings of shutout baseball to close the door on USC.
“I would have taken [three runs],” Hubbs said. “I thought we would have been able to do more against their bullpen day. We weren’t as competitive as I would have liked.”
The Trojans lapsed into some old habits that plagued them at the beginning of the year but looked to be dying until tonight. USC struck out seven times, which isn’t awful. What is awful is the amount of unproductive outs made.
“We had 11 ‘nothing’ fly ball outs,” Hubbs said. “That was 11 that just gave us no chance. Add the seven strikeouts, that’s 18 outs that we just handed them. We have to be better than that.”
Senior second baseman Adam Landecker went 0-for-3 against the Anteaters after going 7-for-12 with three RBIs over the weekend in Berkley.
“Games like this, you gotta piece things together,” Landecker said. “In a game that each team only has five hits, you gotta execute the small things.”
That lack of execution — the “nothing outs” that USC made tonight — is what seems to frustrate Hubbs most.
“We need to force teams have to make plays,” Hubbs said. “You just hit a ball straight up in the air, they don’t have to do much. Strike out and they don’t have to do anything. We have to be more competitive in those spots.”
The Trojans need to rebound quickly, as Mark Appel and the Stanford Cardinal come to Dedeaux Field beginning this Friday. Appel could be the first overall pick in this year’s MLB draft, and Hubbs said he expects more tight game this weekend.

Football practice on Tuesday continued the trend of physical and full-contact intensity, and it concluded with a serious injury. According to Scott Wolf at Inside USC, the Trojans will be without junior wide receiver George Farmer for the foreseeable future, as he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during a non-contact drill.
Major blow · Junior wide receiver George Farmer is tended to at practice after suffering a left knee injury. According to Inside USC, Farmer has a torn ACL and will be out of action for at least nine months. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
With 19 players already out for Tuesday’s practice, Farmer and senior safety Demetrius Wright both left practice early because of injury. Farmer is expected to miss nine months with the tear.
The coaches have placed a heavy emphasis on physicality in recent practices and the risk of injuries has mounted accordingly, but the defense has been responding well.
“We love it. Coach [Lane Kiffin] is holding everybody accountable,” redshirt junior defensive tackle George Uko said. “We have great coaching and great energy.”
During a goal-line drill at the end of practice, a pushing match broke out between redshirt sophomore running back Javorious “Buck” Allen, senior defensive end Morgan Breslin and Uko.
“It was nothing at all,” Uko said. “It’s just what happens on the field. Buck pushed Morgan, and as a defensive linemen your natural reaction is to push back.”
After tensions cooled, the linemen forced a fumble, sparking a raucous celebration by the defense. By the time practice was over, both assistant coach Ed Orgeron and Uko had bloody noses after getting accidentally clocked during the drill.
“Practice was very physical,” Kiffin said. “I’m really excited about the goal-line mentality that the defense had. They really changed the line of scrimmage by how they got after the offense.”
The defensive line has been solid behind the likes of Breslin, Uko and sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams, but concerns of an inexperienced secondary remain.
But though the cornerback position is thin after the departure of veteran Nickell Robey to the NFL draft, USC’s new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast believes the Trojans have enough bodies to contend.
“I like the flexibility with the guys that we have,” Pendergast said. “We’re still working to get the technique there.”
Pendergast is also pleased to have early enrollees in freshmen defensive backs Su’a Cravens and Leon McQuay III practicing with the team.
“The good thing is that they’re here,” Pendergast said. “They have the benefit to be here and learn the system and learn the different techniques. I’m just glad they’re on campus so they can move more quickly when fall comes.”
On the offensive side of the field, freshman quarterback Max Browne has also been settling in and continues to take reps with redshirt sophomore quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek in contact drills.
“At this point, I’m just taking whatever I can get and making the most of it,” Browne said. “The biggest thing is that I’m running out there with Cody and Max and that’s all I could ask for.”
Wittek missed several spring practices with a knee injury but returned last week.
With the injuries piling up, the Trojans may have to dial back on the intensity for the rest of spring, but they certainly aspire to bring this fire when the beginning of the season comes around.

Influence is a curious phenomenon that takes form in so many different ways in music. It’s impossible to say that there is even one song in music history that has had no influence whatsoever. And even if a band was pioneering in its genre style or musical sound, the fact is that people, as individuals, draw on inspiration to do the things they do, especially in the case of art.
This week’s New Noise looks at two different directions that influence can go in. Though The Strokes and Binary Star make their comebacks by returning to the sounds that influenced them in the beginning of their careers and established them as groups, Wavves and Frank Ocean contemporize vintage styles that paved the way for their music and, ultimately, define them as artists.
The Strokes: “All The Time”
The band’s last release, 2011’s Angles, left some die-hard Strokes fans scratching their heads in confusion over the almost 180-degree change in style that the band had taken on, while others praised the new direction.
One of the most arguably appealing things about The Strokes was its seeming aversion to change — both its enormously influential debut album Is This It and its near-perfect sophomore album Room On Fire employed virtually the same blueprint in regard to production techniques and vocal delivery style. After all, if it ain’t broke, why fix it?
Of course, this was one of the things that the band was criticized for as well, with some critics declaring that the band was unable to step outside of their comfort zone and evolve as a group.
First Impressions of Earth saw the band implementing the same musical styles, but this time the production was different — gone were Julian Casablancas’ slick, distorted vocals and the tight control of the instruments. Instead, a much looser, laid-back sound was introduced.
Just two years after Angels, the band is already back with a new album, Comedown Machine. The first single, “All The Time,” is a return to the early sound that made The Strokes the genre pioneers they always were. The quick rhythm guitars, the never-miss-a-beat drumming, the metronome-like bass and the vibrato-heavy vocals all make a return, making “All The Time” the perfect song for lovers of The Strokes’ early days.
Wavves: “Afraid of Heights”
For a split second, the beginning of Wavves’ new single, “Afraid of Heights,” sounds like the iconic intro to Blur’s “Song 2,” with the no-nonsense drumming introducing the chaos to come.
The San Diego surf-rock band has been around since 2009 and the eponymous first single from its fourth studio album finds the band perfecting its unique blend of surf rock, pop and grunge.
The surf-rock genre is mostly associated with upbeat, poppy ambiances, but although Wavves has the pop sensibilities in “Afraid of Heights” — especially with the “ooooh”s in the chorus — there’s a dark cloud hanging over the entire song.
Lead singer Nathan Williams lazily croons “I’ll always be on my own,” and even though his statement is backed by poppy harmonizing vocals, the song is overall grungy and almost dismal in nature. Wavves has honed this sound of theirs extremely well — Making a grungy rock song catchy as hell by setting it against a surf-pop backdrop is no easy feat, but Wavves manages to accomplish this melange of styles with ease.
Binary Star: “Big Bad Wolf”
After more than 13 years away from the limelight, Binary Star is back and better than ever with a new eponymous EP. The duo has always been influential in the underground hip-hop scene, despite breaking up after only two years with personal and creative differences.
You might say they  were the less-drama-and-drugs-and-suicide version to underground hip hop of what the Sex Pistols were to punk. (Almost). Though both One Be Lo and Senim Silla released solo material throughout the aughts, the pair didn’t officially reunite until recently, and the Binary Star EP is the first release since 2000’s critically acclaimed Masters of the Universe.
The EP serves as a kind of celebration of the duo’s 15th anniversary together and is (hopefully) a prelude to a full-length studio LP. “Big Bad Wolf” is classic Binary Star — perfect flows and rhymes, catchy sing-along sections and retro samples that fit in seamlessly with the contemporary flow of the track. Here’s hoping the “Big Bad Wolf” stays bad and releases some more tunes for fans both old and new.
Frank Ocean: “Super Rich Kids”
The always unconventional Frank Ocean’s newest single from his debut album channel ORANGE is “Super Rich Kids,” which features Odd Future’s Earl Sweatshirt. The song is often described as R&B, but in true Ocean style, there’s a twist.
The rhythmic beat is hypnotizing and almost monotonous but somehow never boring. The mix of nonchalant raps and Ocean’s singing is a refreshing contrast, and though the melody of the song is reminiscent of old school R&B/pop, the unique, thumping beat changes up the entire mood of the song.
The song is also simultaneously full of soul and cynicism, satirically criticizing the tedious lives and lack of responsibility displayed by some people belonging to the upper echelons of society.
And the lyrics are dark and there sure isn’t a happy ending, making the compelling piano-led beat all the more ominous.
“Super Rich Kids” is like the soul version of a Bret Easton Ellis novel and proves, once again, why no one does R&B quite like Ocean does.

USC senior Stevee Jo Eads wants you to Drop Your Panties, but just long enough to pick up a new pair from her lingerie brand.
“People get really shocked when they hear the name,” Eads said. “But we’re just young girls trying sell some pretty things.”
All in the family · Despite the fact that USC senior Stevee Jo Eads’ mother is a lingerie designer, Eads originally did not consider a career in design. After she had trouble finding well-priced lingerie that was simple and fun, however, she decided to try her own hand in the business. — Courtesy of Stephanie Weiss
Drop Your Panties was born during a discussion for the name of the line over dinner. Eads had already thrown out a bunch of cutesy names, such as UnderMe, for her brand, but it was her dad that told her to think of a name that made a statement.
The next name that came to mind was Drop Your Panties, and since then, the name has stuck.
Considering that her mother is also a lingerie designer, it’s almost surprising that Eads, a Manhattan Beach native born and raised in Southern California, only seriously started to consider a career in fashion about two years ago.
Eads, who was enrolled at USC after transferring from Southern Methodist University in Dallas her freshman year, said that a series of coincidences led her to pursue a career in lingerie. She still remembers what she told her mom when she first realized that this was something she wanted to do.
“[I said that] it’s so hard to find well-priced lingerie these days for people my age that’s simple and fun, that’s made well and made in the USA,” Eads said.
Eads’ mother told her that she should do it herself. Eads then sat in on a fitting with her mother and realized that she wanted to pursue a career in the fashion industry.
From there, she set about creating Drop Your Panties, an undergarment line that focuses on making high quality and affordable products intended to be flirty and fun.
The business is now eight months old, with four distinct collections (Boyfriend, Liberty, Lucky Lace and Sugar) that will be carried by about 20 stores soon. Drop Your Panties also has an online store, which features the cheery orange logo and the streamlined design that reflect a sassy confidence that Drop Your Panties is meant to reflect.
Eads said she’s always collecting samples and combines what she finds with what she’s made in her “inspiration board.”
“Everything starts with your inspiration board. Twice a year, I’ll go to Paris and attend the Interfilière, the lingerie show, where I see the fabrics and new trends coming in. I also go to the trade shows in New York and Los Angeles,” Eads said.
Right now, Eads’ goal continues to be making lingerie for young women without compromising on affordability or comfort. She hopes that Drop Your Panties will be in 50 stores by the end of the year and 100 stores by the next year. Eads is confident that these goals can be achieved and is currently working to be written up in as many fashion magazines as possible.
She is also trying her best to involve the Trojan community in her enterprise.
“DYP came out of USC, so as many people I can involve in this project from USC, the better it is to me. USC is like family and that’s what makes it so special,” Eads said.
So far, Eads has recruited sophomore Kayla Moore and sophomore Katherine Montgomery as models from her sorority, Delta Gamma, and hopes that they will help market her brand.
Eads is also recruiting USC students for a DYP social media team and flexing her public relations muscle by to drive traffic to her website. Additionally, she’s also trying to come up with more creative ways to make the panty bag popular.
Drop Your Panties might appeal to young women that do ascribe to the philosophy of DYP, but there’s much more to be done before Drop Your Panties will have widespread recognition. Still, Eads is eager to continue innovating and improving her burgeoning brand.

Six days before a scheduled release date of April 2, Tyler, the Creator’s third album Wolf was leaked. Having seemingly anticipated this, the leader of the controversial rap collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All announced that he had uploaded the album to Soundcloud to stream in full.
Growing up · Tyler, the Creator’s 18-track album Wolf represents a part of who he is and serves as another impressive chapter in his discography. – Courtesy of Life or Death PR and Management
He announced the stream on his Twitter, followed by a typically self-deprecating admonition: “YOU SHOULD WAIT UNTIL TUESDAY. THE ALBUM SUCKS THO. ME CRYING ABOUT MY DAD AND ALL THE BEATS SOUND ALIKE. BUT LISTEN FOR YOURSELF.”
Tyler and his Odd Future Gang Kill Them All companions burst onto the underground scene like skateboard-wielding knucklehead bats out of hell following the releases of Tyler’s critically acclaimed album Bastard, member Earl Sweatshirt’s Earl, and the group’s Radical, all uploaded for free. Since then, the group’s success has led to both a hugely dedicated fanbase and staunchly critical opponents. Throughout their journey, the group members seem to have an equal amount of resentment for both.
OF has since established a record label, a clothing brand and permanent storefront on Fairfax Avenue and a show on Adult Swim. The members have garnered numerous accolades, underwent the Delphian disappearance and return of Earl and experienced seemingly everything in between.
Cockroach-eating aside, Tyler has without a doubt established himself as an enormously talented enigma. Love it or hate it, Wolf demands to be heard.
The 2011 LP Goblin was composed mostly of a dichotomous celebration and indignation for Tyler’s newfound spotlight. And after Odd Future’s sudden shift from underground hype to international attention, there was an enormous amount of pressure put on the rapper/producer’s sophomore release.
There is an impressive amount of artistic growth between Goblin and Tyler’s newest release. Wolf sees the return of a matured Bastard aesthetic — accompanied by lush and intricate production. We are once more invited into the insular, deeply personal, often dark, humorous and always fascinating mind of the 22-year-old Tyler and his aliases.
Setting the stage for the 18-track album is the titular track, “Wolf,” in which Tyler’s alter ego/therapist Dr. TC is heard introducing Wolf Haley to Sam and other miscellaneous characters at the fictional “Camp Flog Gnaw,” one of many anagrams the group has established for Wolf Gang.
In the track, the character of Wolf (which presumably resonates most closely with Tyler’s own personality) states “So, are you guys into jazz?” to which Sam responds aggressively. The relationship between these two characters is developed throughout the album, weaving an intricate narrative arc that seems to serve as a fanciful distraction while Tyler copes with his more deeply rooted issues.
The second track, “Jamba” (featuring fellow Odd Future member, Hodgy Beats) introduces these issues. Tyler immediately sets the stage for the rest of the album’s lyrical project, rapping “Papa ain’t call even though he saw me on TV, it’s all good (f-ck you).” Clearly it isn’t “all good” — this is a deeply affecting and humanizing notion that we see continue throughout the album as Tyler grapples with his issues of abandonment and the absence of a father figure. Tyler again addresses his absent father in “Answer”: “Mom was only 20 when you ain’t have any f-cks to spare / You Nigerian f-ck, now I’m stuck with this sh-tty facial hair.” He then goes on to acknowledge that this pain has allowed him to be successful: “Stuck with a beautiful home with a case stairs / So you not being near f-cking fire-started my damn career.”
Thankfully, “Answer” is a stark and welcome transition in production style and content; the stellar track features a melodic guitar riff over a solid beat, lyrically echoing the vulnerability of Tyler’s similarly sentimental “Inglorious” from Bastard.
The following track, “Cowboy,” sees Tyler personifying himself as a cowboy, musing about the consequences of fame, insisting that he is the “cowboy on [his] own trip” over a dark jazzy piano riff and strings.
Frank Ocean is featured on the following song, “Slater,” singing a chorus of “I just wanna ride my bike” as Tyler continues to subject himself to dizzying and scattered psychoanalysis. He states “I stopped rapping and started asking ‘Where my f-cking passion is’” and admits that he “didn’t ask for this” and “did [rapping] out of boredom.”
The song is an enjoyable listen. The lyrics, however, seem to be a jumbled interlude into summertime naivete that takes away slightly from the album’s overall aesthetic.
Next is the strange anti-drug “PSA 48,” beginning with a recording of a Nas interview wherein he speaks of the damage that crack cocaine caused.
“PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer” seems to be a series of three vignettes (and, at the end of the day, serves mostly as a chance for Tyler to show off his production skills) — including a charming plea for a dance with a romantic interest, followed by the enormously catchy “Bimmer” which includes references to everything from R. Kelly to Tame Impala.
“IFHY” is a musically impressive track detailing a characteristically troublesome relationship with a love interest, aided by one of Tyler’s idols, Pharrell Williams. Even in the asinine “Trashwang,” Tyler’s agile and clever lyricism shoulders the silly, gunshot-filled Lex Luger-style production. “Treehome95” is a gorgeous nu-soul track in which none other than Erykah Badu steals the spotlight. Other OF anthemic tracks — “Parking Lot,” “Rusty” and “Pigs” — are filled with clever wordplay and are sure to please fans of the group’s more hedonistic work.
Wolf is the next chapter in the work of the “f-cking walking paradox” that Tyler once labeled himself to be, a mix of dark, moody synths, horns and retro jazzy keyboard chord progressions makes for gorgeous beats and shows impressive growth in production since Goblin. Many are inclined to blow off the rapper-producer’s efforts as flippant, childish and ultimately obscene. It’s arguable that his latest effort challenges the notion of Tyler as a braggadocious shock artist as he guides the listener on a tour of his complex id.
There are moments of exceptional delivery in virtually every track and impressive features from Odd Future co-conspirators. Even in the album’s characteristic vulgarity, there is artistic value.
References to a new home and stairs/staircases permeate the album lyrically, serving as a convenient metaphor for Tyler’s five-year journey since Bastard. Picture the tall, lanky 22-year-old standing at the foot of a long staircase in a home that he now owns, implored, as underscored by the voicemail on “Rusty,” to “grow up, don’t grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up! Don’t grow down, grow out.”
Ultimately, as described in the final track, “Lone,” Tyler struggles with the expectations placed upon him, the pressures of fame and the loss of his grandmother. Brutally honest, angsty, boastful and hopelessly self-deprecating, Wolf utterly humanizes Tyler.
The album as a whole is filled with both sonic and lyrical ingenuity and ultimately serves as a reminder that the Tyler’s journey up the stairs certainly didn’t begin with Goblin —and isn’t likely to end soon.
Hello all! There is a typo in this that I would like to excuse myself for – a track mentioned is indeed simply titled “48”, I simply wanted to compare it to a PSA. Much love.

When word got out that Kevin Bludso, of Bludso’s BBQ in Compton, would be teaming up with the folks responsible for The Golden State gastropub to open a new Bludso’s Bar-&-Cue in West Hollywood, it sounded like it would be the perfect marriage of down-home Texas ‘cue with a posh-and-polished Hollywood sheen.
After all, a visit to the famous Bludso’s in Compton will reveal some major logistical concerns, including a complete absence of legitimate seating and a beverage menu consisting solely of bottled water and canned sodas — issues that could potentially be rectified at a new location.
Unfortunately, by addressing these problems, Bludso’s has given birth to a whole new set of issues.
Though the opening of Bludso’s Bar-&-Cue in West Hollywood last month roughly recreates the much-adored barbecue, it complicates the down-home sensibilities of barbecue with a Hollywood zip code, more seating and a full bar.
Walk into the restaurant on a very lively Friday night and it becomes clear — this ain’t the South. The sleek, modern bar lines the south end of the restaurant and is accented with glass shelves and dark wood trim. Glowing flat-screen TVs stare down at the patrons seated communally on contrastively plain, black picnic benches — the ambiance is decidedly Dixieland-meets-Hollywood.
The paradox doesn’t seem to matter much until the barbecue arrives and a tension forms between fare and ambiance, begging the question: “Is it OK to use my hands?”
For seasoned barbecue fanatics, the scene is painfully awkward: every visual cue in the restaurant lends itself to a pretentiousness virtually never associated with eating barbecue. In what seemed almost as if the result of the glitzy decor, many of the patrons appeared relegated to the most appalling form of barbecue-eating barbarism: using a knife and fork.
Still, regardless of how it’s eaten, Bludso’s primary claim to culinary prominence comes in the way of his Texas-style brisket — a fork-tender tour de force with a smokiness so deep that, upon first taste, it practically forces you to exhale through your nostrils in a sort of savory ecstasy.
The St. Louis-style ribs, however, which turn out to be a disappointment in comparison to the ribs from the original location. The meat, though serviceably tender with full-bodied smoky flavor, clings to the bone. Drier meat that sticks to the bone is a surefire indicator of poor temperature control. The result is a rib that is difficult to eat, with the tougher rib tips bordering on inedible.
The chicken and pulled pork at Bludso’s employ a similar smokiness but to a lesser effect. Both stand on their own as among the best in the city. The even cooking of the chicken is impressive — the breast meat is juicy and the wings manage to keep from drying out.
All of these meats are accompanied by two warm Texas-style barbecue sauces: a spicy sauce that combines a little sweetness with serious heat in the finish and a more traditionally sweet, tomato-and-vinegar-style sauce. The flavor profiles of both sauces are largely unremarkable, perhaps to favor the flavor of the meats themselves.
Ordering side dishes at Bludso’s are the dining equivalent of Russian roulette. The macaroni and cheese is some of the best to be had, a comforting rendition that invites multiple helpings. Where the sides really fall flat is with the cole slaw, an uninspired melange of chopped cabbage and carrots brought together by a rumor of a dressing that fails to materialize in any meaningful way.
The collard greens show promise in execution but arrive at the table unappetizingly steeped to the brim in salty cooking liquid. All of this is rounded out with cornbread that seems to have been appended as a dry, crumbly afterthought.
The popularity of Bludso’s Hollywood location is undeniable. Throngs of L.A.’s food-conscious cognoscenti crowd the doorway and wait for upward of an hour for a table on a Friday night. But though the appeal of a barbecue-and-bar combination seems conceptually sound at first blush, upon actually dining there, one discovers how a meal as idyllic and comforting as Southern BBQ could be transformed into an almost unpleasant experience by Hollywood pretensions.
True fans of Bludso’s ‘cue are best served by making the pilgrimage out to the original Compton location and taking a rack of their superior St. Louis ribs to the privacy of their homes — where it’s fine to eat with your hands.

On March 15, the Boston College administration sent a letter to its student body demanding the end of Safe Sites, spaces on campus providing free contraception and information about sex. Safe Sites, according to the letter, violate the institution’s Catholic principles.
Resistance has since become the overwhelming reaction of the BC student body, with some students continuing to operate Safe Sites out of their dorm rooms. Last week, the college threatened penalties against these students.
The administration’s measures, though seemingly archaic, would do well to ignite re-evaluation of contraception policy at campuses across the nation, including here at USC.
Easy arguments can be made for acknowledging the benefits of the one-night stand and accepting — even celebrating — experimentation. These make for learning experiences. They teach us about our preferences and convictions. Experiential learning is, of course, a foundation of the college experience. Therefore sex is too.
That doesn’t mean, though, that the “Vagina Cupcakes!” cupcake-decorating event that kicked off USC’s Sex Week last month was a particularly effective or progressive step toward healthy, positive sex education. And, closer to the BC scandal, that doesn’t mean every resident advisor needs a beach pail of condoms outside their door, as is the case at USC.
The ability to fornicate shouldn’t be as easy as reaching into a fishbowl and scooping out a handful of Trojans. No, these BC students weren’t so obvious in their attempt to encourage safe sex. But the leaders of more liberal institutions, such as our own, have some self-questioning to do.
With condoms so readily available, the college student doesn’t necessarily think less of sex, but often thinks less about it. Sure, sex carries different emotional ties for every individual. But even those who openly and frequently engage in the activity — and often do so with multiple partners — should be so freewheeling by way of rational journey.
Thus, sex isn’t a thoughtless act. And safe sex isn’t just about protecting oneself from STDs and unwanted children as much as abstinence isn’t just about respecting God’s law.
In the case of Boston College’s administration, the intentions are wrong but the measures are closer to right.
USC administrators need not ban the condom bucket nor forbid the condom as a party favor, but they would be smart to encourage assessment of free contraceptives, for both the givers and the takers.
Limiting the availability of free contraceptives, after all, wouldn’t result in a USC student-child daycare center and won’t create a need for a chlamydia resource center. To think students would be affected in such a way is insulting to the collective intelligence of the student body. And to think even one student would be affected in such a way is insulting to the education practices of the university.
Yet the latter is far more believable because sex, despite being a primary concern of many students, is an area of education the university simply addresses, well, simply.
Doling out condoms en masse might seem to be a helpful preventative measure aimed at lowering student pregnancy rates and protecting students from STDs, but it also prevents any actual introspection about the act of sex and what it means to the emotional safety of the individual.
If you’re too uncomfortable to go out and buy your own contraceptives, what exactly does that say about you and how you feel about the act in which you’re planning to engage?
Boston College has its own, highly debatable convictions about sex, but has now forced its students to acquire their own contraceptives. That’s outrageous, impressive and rewarding indeed, just as sex should be.

Too embarrassed to buy contraceptives?
More like too cheap…
Your argument appeals to the traditionalist in all of us but doesn’t actually work as intended. The states that teach “abstinence only” sex education, push the purity ball trend, and harp on planned parenthood are also the ones with the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs – coincidence?
College gives a bunch of 18-year-olds total control over their decisions, many for the first time, and we can’t expect all of those decisions to be good ones. Kids make mistakes. I’m sure as hell glad condoms were as readily available as they were my freshman year
Wait so what’s the argument?
Honestly it sounds like YOU think about sex a little too much to be considering the psychological-emotional implications of a condom bucket and vagina cupcakes.
Also, the claim that using free condoms means you’re embarrassed or ashamed about sex are your own hangups. Buying condoms is embarrassing because of the social stigmas of sex that are enforced by backwards religious institutions and people like you who think they can judge someone’s sex life from afar!
Everyone has a different motto when it comes to sex, and the most important piece is to keep everyone safe from physicial diseases, not emotional troubles.
As a health student, im pretty certain that more preventative measures are better. Like we don’t limit the flu shot so people are more cautious about getting the flu. So lets keep the condom buckets, shall we?
Daily Trojan, the only thing I’m embarrassed about it that you would post this rubbish.
My cupcake itches!
Did this writer even go to the vagina cupcakes event? (No) There was a sex educator there to talk with everyone. :/
LOL, Clown article bro
sounds like you need to get laid bro

Just when everyone thought they had gotten a glimpse into what really happened during the military operation that killed infamous al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, another account comes out contradicting it.
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
This additional account arrived last week from a member of SEAL Team 6, the military unit that executed the May 2011 raid on bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan. The continuing barrage of conflicting information from individuals who are meant to keep such information secret reflects the harm that leaking classified information could cause.
The most recent account, released in response to an Esquire cover letter that told the tale of a man identified only as “The Shooter,” rejects the Esquire story’s description of how the man killed bin Laden as “complete B-S.” The Esquire article also happens to contradict the information in the controversial book No Easy Day, released by SEAL Team 6 member Matt Bissonnette, while yet another narrative is given in the film Zero Dark Thirty.
The confusion regarding what actually happened that night in Abbottabad shouldn’t be surprising, especially given that the operation was supposed to be a top-secret government operation with no detailed information given to the public.
The problem is that Americans expect to be told absolutely everything about everything — and the perpetual quest for controversial information has invaded a sphere that should be kept separate of public prying. Though freedom of information and government transparency are very important in domestic issues, releasing classified information on national security operations has the capacity to bring more harm than good.
Aside from what has thus far proved to be fruitless squabbling over the minor details of one of the most hyped military operations in American history, the larger question should be whether those on the Special Operations team that killed bin Laden acted unethically in sharing the operational details that they promised to protect.
Bissonnette faced praise and criticism when he published his account of the operation under the pseudonym Mark Owen. This publication resulted in threats from the Pentagon that they would take legal action against Bissonnette for sharing classified information. According to a letter to Bissonnette and the publishing company behind his book, Bissonnette violated a non-disclosure agreement he signed while on active duty in 2007.
The point of keeping certain information classified is not just so the government can avoid being held accountable for its intelligence and military actions, as some of Bissonnette’s supporters might think. Instead, it is necessary for maintaining operational security. The purpose of Operation Security is to ensure that military and intelligence operations undertaken to protect national security are untainted by the release of information that could be used against the U.S.
It is thus unacceptable and dangerous for people, such as Bissonnette, to share such information with the public having agreed to protect the United States’ classified information.
In a message to the members of a SEAL unit that he commands, Head of the Naval Special Warfare Command Rear Adm. Sean Pybus expressed his disappointment over such disclosures of classified information: “We do NOT advertise the nature of our work, NOR do we seek recognition for our actions.”
Pybus’ sentiments should be common among all those who work in the interest of national security. The public’s desire for information on the operation that killed the most hated man in America is justifiable, but just because it is there does not mean that government operatives should give in to public pressure and the potential for fame and recognition.
The job of people, such as Bissonnette and his fellow SEALs, is not to sate the public’s thirst for classified details, but to do whatever they can to protect the homeland from enemies both foreign and domestic. The continued argument over the SEAL Team 6 operation against bin Laden indicates that these people are not carrying out their duties, which in the end only makes America more vulnerable to its enemies.

While the purple and gold have dominated the headlines this season, the red and blue have done something more important: win basketball games.
The Los Angeles Clippers (49-26) are primed to win their first Pacific Division title and the most games in franchise history this season – the franchise record is 49 wins – but have flown under the radar in comparison to their dramatic Laker counterparts.
Before the Miami Heat rattled off a historic 27-game win streak, the Clippers held the season’s longest streak, winning 17 games in a row from the end of November to the beginning of January.
But after sprinting out to a NBA-best 32-9 start, the Clippers have faltered, going a pedestrian 17-17 since. They once looked like a lock for the three-seed, right behind the mighty San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder, yet now may be in jeopardy of losing home-court advantage in the first round.
As the inevitable winners of their division, the Clippers will have a top-four seed. But, as NBA rules dictate, if the Clippers are the four-seed, and the five-seed manages a better record, the Clippers will start the series on the road.
Now two games back in the loss column to both the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies, this may be their sobering reality. Which is perplexing, as there’s no palpable reason for the Clippers’ sudden demise.
Head coach Vinny Del Negro has cited a lack of effort and intensity in recent games as a major deterring factor, but the Clippers have enough talent to get by on most nights.
Whatever is the issue, it needs to be resolved fast. With only seven games remaining in the regular season, the Clippers cannot make any more excuses. They have to win now. A couple more losses, and they all but guarantee themselves three straight road playoff series before a daunting match-up with the Heat, if the Clippers somehow manage to get that far.
The Lakers have been playing better recently, but the truth is if they make the playoffs, they are going to be nothing more than a first-round out. They’re not going to beat the Spurs or Thunder; they would be lucky to win more than a game.
Meanwhile, the Clippers can still right the ship and win a series or two. They’ve been competitive against the Spurs and Thunder this year. Plus, as the Lakers have shown in most of their recent championship seasons, you don’t need the best record in the conference or league to make a deep playoff run.
In the beginning of the season, Los Angeles had high expectations for its two teams. One team has struggled all season, yet dominated the media coverage. The other has played championship-level ball, only to fall back down to earth late in the season. Still, they have a legitimate chance to make noise in the postseason. The first team is the Lakers; the second is the Clippers. My how things have changed.

One of the main purposes of this blog is “telexperimentation.” To that effect, it’s about watching new shows that are off my beaten path, really just to see what sticks. In that regard, starting with Game of Thrones was either a great idea or a terrible idea; jumping into a fantasy world in some distant-past version of the British Isles after two seasons of “sexposition” and killings was a bold move. I thought I would get a crash course in the lore, and that the third season premiere would be-action packed and fun and that at the end I would declaim from the rooftop, “I get it! I’m hooked!” To my disappointment, I found it stagnant and unremarkable.
Now, I am not a viewer who is drawn to the “epic” fantasy series. I often gravitate towards lower stakes, or to programs that address worldly issues. However, I have just as much fun watching The Lord of the Rings or even The Hobbit as anyone else with a soul; I play a game with my sister that combines the zodiac with Harry Potter house sorting (yeah, you’re missing out).
Ready to embrace a new world, I sat down to watch “Valar Dohaeris” (which translates to “all men must serve” in the imagined language of the source material) prepared to see LOTR meets The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe meets porn—fictional ancient royals are fighting over the kingdom, there are supernatural creatures involved, and winter is oppressive—but instead I saw all of that wrapped in pretentious dullness.
Perhaps the least enthralling aesthetic traits of the show were its color scheme and it’s aural tone. This may be a trend in contemporary fantasy cinema. Towards the end of the Harry Potter film series, I noticed that each film became darker, greyer and grimmer in color; the pretense, it seemed, was that the color palette emphasized the “dark” themes of the later books. The effect is nullifying. It signifies a desire to make a fun, fantasy series into a serious, grim, piece (it’s not just fantasy, after all, but HBO).
In the premiere no one spoke above a whisper or a dramatic mumble; the tone was so static that I actually found it hard to pay attention (it reminded me of another highly-touted HBO drama, Treme). The exception was the scene between the stern man and Peter Dinklage’s character. He raises his voice to inform Dinklage that he is no heir to the throne, and that he’s “ill-formed” and killed his mother in childbirth.
I suspect Dinklage’s character is a nod to Richard III, as one of the series’ main historical influences is the English War of the Roses. The show seems to rely on vague historical allusions and a general acceptance that the GoT battles took place somewhere, some time—just not specifically anywhere at any point.
Whether the historical tale told is accurate or meaningful seems to be a secondary concern. As a new viewer, I heard the show’s thesis ring out when Sansa and her handmaiden are playing a shipwatching game in which they imagine the purpose and destination of each ship. When the handmaiden falls back on factual knowledge, Sansa scolds her: “the truth is either terrible or boring.”
This speaks to the enduring popularity of the fantasy genre throughout the history of storytelling. Tolkien wrote his series during WWII, and Game of Thrones has prompted a resurgence of the epic during a time of economic unrest. As Sansa implies, fantasies are often more exciting than the mundane, and real life comes with baggage that most of us would like to forget. Whether or not you approve of this sort of escapism depends on your artistic point of view; you could call fantasy the pinnacle of human imagination and world-building, or you could call it bread and circus.
Either way, the most exciting part of the show was toward the end when a little demon girl jumped off the boardwalk and utterly disappeared. I woke up from my stupor, hoping to find out who she was and where she was going. Her identity was not revealed, but the moment gave me a taste of the kind of fantasy I wanted to see—mythical creatures, fully fleshed and otherworldy.
Otherwise, the experience of watching Game of Thrones as a foreigner was sort of like watching a sport game, the rules of which you don’t know. It’s fun to watch them throw the ball around, and it’s funny when your friends get heated over team loyalties, but mostly you just feel like an alien.
 
its difficult for new viewers to come into the show now and fully enjoy it, there are intricate plot-lines for all the characters. The show does not have standalone episodes, but requires investment of time from the viewer. better to catch up on seasons 1 and 2 before viewing season 3, definitely worth it.

Skull and Dagger prank USC students on Tuesday by holding a fake special announcement at Tommy Trojan, commemorating their 100 year anniversary. Current USG President Mikey Geragos introduced the event, with athletes Matt Barkley, Marqise Lee and Khaled Holmes announcing the prank.

Nah, this one was funny.  All the ones in the past few years have been the same basic formula: promise students something cool for free, have them come to TT, and then say “GOTCHA LOLOLOLOLOL”  At least this one took it in a different direction.
Aren’t pranks meant to be funny? For the people not pranked at least… Who in the world would find this funny?? It’s just a weird thing to spend so much time doing.. Whatever happened to
I’ve been enjoying Skull & Dagger’s pranks those past years that I’ve been at SC, and the one they pulled for coachella a few years ago was spectacular and funny, and pissed a lot of people off, which is the point of a prank.  But THIS, on the other hand, is not a prank.  It clearly was vetted by the administration, which is the opposite of what a prank should be.  
So, call it a celebration, a joke, and I’m glad their having fun, but if this was a prank, then this is a fail.  Skull & Dagger, if you’re to honor your tradition, you shouldn’t ask for permission.  I demand a redo!
lol
