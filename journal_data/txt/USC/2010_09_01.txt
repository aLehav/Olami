The gift from Walter and Marcia Kortschak is one of the largest non-alumni donations in the university’s history. It is also the largest donation ever made to the Division of Student Affairs.
“Our hope is that this center will help to demystify learning differences, provide current students with state-of-the-art assistive technologies and strong learning strategies to excel in their chosen field and thereby promote the power of self advocacy,” Walter Kortschak said.
The USC Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity will provide aid to students with dyslexia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other learning difficulties by providing tutoring, personal counseling, technological assistance, academic research and one-on-one help to students.
Students with special learning differences are currently assisted through USC’s Center for Academic Support and Disability Services & Programs, located on the third floor of the Student Union.
The Kortschak family studied a number of other centers at leading research universities such as Stanford and Yale that support students with dyslexia and other learning differences before it found the right match at USC, Walter Kortschak said.
“We took our time to make sure our objectives were aligned with USC and to design a program that takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the university,” he said. “USC is unique because of its amazing breadth of research capabilities within the College, the Keck School of Medicine, the Rossier School of Education and the Occupational Science and Therapy program, which will provide for excellent collaboration between these disciplines.”
The new center — slated to be about 2,000 square feet in size — will accommodate three full-time staff, eight tutors and eight learning assistants, said Edward Roth, assistant dean and director of USC Disability Services & Programs.
“The new center will be a terrific resource for students with learning disabilities and ADHD who learn differently,” Roth wrote in an e-mail.
There will also be a study area, learning assistance area and space for one-on-one learning assistance. Students will be able to work with computers and other assistive technology, Roth said.
“We need to bring out the best in each and every student and provide them with the learning supports to reach their highest potential,” Walter Kortschak said.
The program also plans to continuously recruit more “world-class educators” to aid students, Walter Kortschak said.
Students at the Kortschak Center will have access to other professional resources outside the center, including psychologists, occupational therapists, neuropsychologist and other specialists, according to the Division of Student Affairs.
The Kortschaks are the parents of Andrew Kortschak, a junior majoring in political science and cinematic arts, and Sarah Kortschak, an undeclared freshman. Walter Kortschak also serves on the Board of Leaders at the Marshall School of Business.

Nearly a year after its opening, the USC Blood Donor Center is continuing its efforts to reach out to students for more donors.
Bleed cardinal · The center, located in the University Village, helps provide the USC hospitals with 85 percent of their donated blood. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
President C.L. Max Nikias has been instrumental in getting the message to potential donors. In a letter to the Trojan Family, Nikias stated that students, faculty and staff donating blood can help the university’s hospitals become more self-sufficient.
According to Maria Muniz, manager of the blood center, between the mobile donor drives and the two donor centers, USC is 75 to 85 percent self-sufficient. She said that the new donor center has helped to support their progress.
“Trying to get to 100 percent efficiency is an ambitious goal, but now with the donor center it’s becoming closer to reality,” Muniz said. “Every month is getting better than the last.”
Located in the University Village right across from the main campus, the center opened in an effort to increase the blood bank so USC’s hospitals can become self-sufficient.
Not many students, however, know about the donor center, she said.
“Last year we didn’t get enough marketing out there to let the students know that we’re here,” Muniz said.
One way the center reaches out to students is through its mobile blood drives, which occur twice a month on Trousdale Parkway. After the blood drive, a donor is contacted and asked to donate more regularly.
“They don’t know that we have a center and it’s our opportunity to grab their attention,” Muniz said.
Another goal of the center is to reach a point where mostly USC students and student organizations are involved. Not only can students help save lives by donating blood, but they also have the opportunity to fulfill community service requirements for their organizations.
“It’s really an effort to see how many organizations we can have represented at the donor center. We’re really tapping into the student base and getting them to be regular donors and spread the word,” Muniz said.
Alumna Karen Poon has become one of those regular donors. Poon, who graduated last December with a degree in accounting, donated blood for the fourth time Tuesday.
Her first time donating to USC was at a mobile blood drive two years ago. After graduating she looked for a place to donate blood and discovered the donor center. Poon thought it was a good idea to go back to USC to donate.
“I feel comfortable coming back here, I see [the staff] a lot,” she said.
Poon feels that the blood center is more private and personal than previous places she has donated blood.  Since it’s smaller, she feels that the employees are trustworthy.
“When I came in [the first time] it was perfect,” she said.
Kyle Allen, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, first donated blood at his high school, where the Red Cross held blood drives every semester.
Allen wasn’t aware of the donor center nearby, but heard about its location at the University Village.
“It was a rewarding experience and I plan on doing it again,” Allen said.
Muniz said that students who donate in college are more likely to donate later in life. The center aims to create educated donors who will hopefully donate beyond their years at USC.
Previously, there had only been one USC donor center on the Health Sciences Campus, near the University Hospital.
When USC took control of the USC Norris Cancer Hospital and the USC University Hospital last year, the hospitals had plans for blood supply growth, Muniz said.
“It was preemptive on our part to build a new donor center,” Muniz said.

The quintet’s name perhaps does not ring a bell in the minds of music fans fixated on popular Video Music Award-nominated stars, but Far From Finished’s recent release Forgettable hopes to change that. The 13-track album presents a portrait of the band’s personality and is sure to get some bells ringing in rock fans’ minds.
Punk hopefuls · The third release of Far From Forgettable, with help from famed producer Jim Siegel, tries to garner even more fans. - Photo courtesy of Earshot Media  
Hailing from Boston, the band teamed up with famed producer Jim Siegel, known for his projects with powerhouse punk bands Dropkick Murphys and The Unseen. Far From Finished’s blooming punk persona doesn’t stop there — with two prior releases and a sought-after spot in the grandiose Vans Warped Tour, the band continues to push forward in the music industry.
Its tunes reveal influence from Green Day, a high voice detailing stories ranging from romantic relationships to drug abuse. Despite possible comparisons to other well-known punk bands, Far From Finished holds its own. The band’s talent lies in its ability to capture a range of emotion and put the right riffs — or in some cases, violin notes — with those feelings. For a twist, the band takes mostly serious lyrics and pairs them with bouncy music. The songs infuse punk and pop with the standard instruments of guitar and drums but also create a different tempo with the more mellow and classical instruments of piano and violin.
The opening track of the album, “Outerspace,” tugs the listener into the CD immediately. The lines are honest and to the point, the shocking simplicity of piano notes and a medium-high voice blending seamlessly.
Touching on the universal theme of teenage rebellion, Far From Finished attracts young listeners but also plugs in a mature aspect to the cliched battle between youngsters and their parental authorities. Frontman Steve Neary’s melancholy voice croons the words, Guess my father was right / shouldn’t have stayed out all night / but what’s a boy to do / daddy doing drugs is so much fun.
The incantation of the word “outerspace” later in the song signals the unfurling of a layered instrumental piece which takes up the latter half of the song. Despite its considerable length, the musical interlude showcases an obvious thoughtfulness and attention to musical detail, therefore managing to keep listeners engaged.
Immediately after this ballad, the mood lifts. The following track, fittingly titled “I Just Wanna Play,” offers a more upbeat tune. The songs begins quickly with peppy high guitar notes and a smooth bass line. The singer’s voice keeps the song subdued, meshing a slightly gloomy mood with a screaming anthem near the end that offers an arena-like sound. “I just wanna play with my radio” serves as the central theme of the song, touching on the idea of using music as an escape.
Indeed, the band integrates this concept throughout the album by using the members’ life experiences to add poignancy to the tracks, producing tunes that show the acceptance of their youth and the struggles they encountered.
The band breaks out the trumpets during the track “Pliva-638,” a song presented in classic punk style, the fast riffs and energized drum beat providing an ironic background for the lyrics’ emotions, a trademark characteristic of the band.
The unique track’s name yields a playful platform for instrumental experimentation, a small piano note jumping in every now and then, a guitar chord screaming every so often and a slight pause that gives way to the confident loudness of the chorus. The band lets go of any restraint and creates a song sandwiched between ska-style trumpet notes. The matching of the clever lyrics — I get to be the wrecking ball / and you get to be the wreck — along with solid guitar-playing help wrap up one of the band’s best tracks.
As a whole, the album enlightens listeners about the existence of a lesser-known quintet with a natural talent for creating tracks that echo in the mind. The singer’s voice, though at times shy, feels intimate, almost as if the singer himself were almost pressing his lips against the recording microphone.
Though not all the tracks hold the same amount of complexity or offer the same appeal, if the band embraces more of the unrestrained directness and shocking simplicity of the opening track “Outerspace” and continues the pairing of upbeat music with heartfelt words, its sound will surely become even more signature. And perhaps this recent release can serve as the launching point for an even larger career.
To exploit the pun-filled nature of the band and its newest release, Far From Finished really is just starting its music career and remains far from throwing in the towel. For fans of tracks that bring a little upbeat, a little emotion and musical talent, this album is far from forgettable.

The Rossier School of Education is training teachers from Crenshaw High School as part of a greater effort to revitalize the school in a sustainable way.
Professors work in conjunction with the Greater Crenshaw Educational Partnership, which is part of the Los Angeles Urban League’s larger initiative to improve the area with the help of local institutions and community members.
“The whole goal is to create a new model of schooling that will work for urban communities for which current models have not worked very well in the past,” said Sylvia Rousseau, professor of education and GCEP interim executive director.
Last year, Rousseau helped Crenshaw separated by into small learning communities that have themes such as social justice or business. Within each community, teachers will apply problem-based learning strategies and learn to integrate multiple strategies in relation to one problem.
“[Problem-based learning] focuses on a contemporary problem and uses it as a focal point. For example, if the problem were how to develop more entrepreneurs, then in English and math and social science and science, learning will be related to solving that problem,” said Sandra Kaplan, one of six Rossier professors providing training.
Last year, Rossier professors trained two small groups of Crenshaw teachers in areas including literacy, numeracy, assessment and special education. The program plans to increase the number of teachers it trains throughout the year and focus on how to sustain progress in the school.
“The real model that you want to move toward is something called the professional development school, which has the continuing presence of faculty helping the school,” Rousseau said. “It’s a collaborative model where the faculty is working with teachers to improve the school.”
The collaboration between Rossier professors and Crenshaw teachers is key to creating the best strategies for students, Rousseau said.
“Communities know things about their own resources, know their own values and have tremendous funds of knowledge. The universities also have tremendous funds of knowledge. We have to find ways over time to structure our resources in a way that comes together, to educate a youth that have not been educated very well in the past,” Rousseau said.
In the past year after applying this philosophy of community, university and school collaboration, Crenshaw has already seen results.
“We saw a higher retention of ninth-grade students — and most research says we lose most students at the ninth grade — and saw a significant jump in graduating,” Rousseau said. “The first year showed us that we’re creating an infrastructure that shows continuing progress. Those structures lead to more concrete test results.”
The primary goal of the Rossier-Crenshaw partnership is to ensure that it continues to be collaborative and productive so that Crenshaw can continually grow.
“We’re all committed to the idea of taking theory into practice. The things we read about and write about are being implemented, and that’s very exciting,” Kaplan said. “The one goal is to get students college ready so they can be more successful.”

Over the weekend, Chilean art collective Casagrande dropped poetry bombs on Berlin — the fifth city the organization has bombed.
These guys get in a helicopter, fly above a major city and release about 400 pieces of poetry on a city as a message of peace and beauty. It seems like a pretty cool idea considering people largely ignore poetry that doesn’t fall from the sky.
According to the Los Angeles Times, L.A. will someday get its own rain of poetry. Bay Area- based poet S.A. Griffin (who’s also a celebrated commercial/advertisement actor) is apparently organizing it.
Griffin has already collected 400 poems, but is planning on taking another 400 with him on his raid. Interested in submitting? He’s up for suggestions through his Facebook page.
Let the rain pour.

Five cadets took an oath of enlistment Wednesday afternoon, promising to complete the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program and serve as officers in the future.
Proud · Five of the Reserve Officer’s Training Corps cadets pledged an enlistment oath Wednesday on the steps of the Physical Education Building. The oath means the cadets will continue their service with the  army after graduation. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
USC’s ROTC program has 35 cadets in total but five decided to take this oath this afternoon, Maj. David Jackson said.
“The oath is committing to be future army officers,” Jackson said. “After two to four years of training, they will accept the terms that they will be future army leaders.”
According to Maj. Robert Medina and Jackson, the cadets will graduate and receive an officer’s rank commission. Cadets will learn leadership, become ethical decision makers and train to become physically fit, morally straight and technically competent.
Sophomore history major Cadet Michael Lockhart has been in the army reserves for seven years. He joined the ROTC program after working in Iraq as a battalion motor sergeant and served there for 11 months and 16 days while working with vehicles and equipment.
“I think I had a really good experience overseas and I’m eager to go back in the future,” Lockhart said. “I love understanding why things are the way they are and hope to teach history at USC or work in the ROTC or army in the future.”
A first-year graduate student at the School of Social Work, Cadet Daniel Lee Burns has wanted to join the army since high school to be part of the social work military program.
Since his grandfather did not have the chance to attend USC like he wanted to, Burns said he is honored to be a part of the ROTC program here.
“I feel great pride in being here every day to do something and be a part of something,” Burns said. “If you didn’t learn values, you’ll learn them in the army. Becoming a good soldier comes with being a good person.”
In a San Diego school district, Burns taught many children who came from military families. This has prompted him to work with military parents, children who have lost families and those still dealing with that loss.
Another first-year graduate student at the School of Social Work, Cadet Hannah Stryker, also took the oath of enlistment.
“When a soldier enlists in the army, they make a decision to sacrifice their mental well-being for something bigger than themselves for service, values and country,” Stryker said. “When soldiers come home, society has a tendency to admit that war ends in the battlefield, but that is not the case as you see many soldiers bring the war with them.”
Stryker plans on working in the combat stress control unit, depending where the United States stands in the war.
“Given the incredible opportunity at USC, I’m honored to be a part of the U.S. Army and especially as a social worker,” Stryker said. “I feel that this is the best place for me and I can’t stress enough the need for military social workers and I feel like we can do more to help.”
Cadet Joseph Dombrosky, a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning as well as political science, also joined the ROTC program to serve his country.
“My dad was in the military and I always felt like I had a sense of duty to serve,” Dombrosky said. “I think that being in ROTC has definitely made me more disciplined and more confident. I feel more sense of pride in myself and my country in general.”
Freshman electrical engineering major Cadet Matt Zecchini took the oath of enlistment, and Cadet Sean Inkelaar-Cruz, a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning, will pledge next week as well.
Correction: 9/2/10 — A previous version of this story misidentified the school district at which Burns taught. The story has been corrected to reflect the change.

The Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine, Calif. should be dubbed the “Green Day Amphitheater.” On Tuesday, the band executed a full-scale invasion of the venue during its three-hour-plus set, featuring tracks that spanned from the very beginning of its 22-year career to a new song titled “Cigarettes and Valentines.” Audience members of the sold-out crowd were captivated by the 38 — yes, 38 — song performance that was as energetic as it was tight.
Although the California veteran band AFI opened the evening with an enjoyable set that included hits such as “Miss Murder” and “Girl’s Not Grey,” the night belonged entirely to Green Day. The lights dimmed around 8:15 p.m., and Green Day took the stage as the introductory track to last year’s release, 21st Century Breakdown, came over the loudspeakers. A pyrotechnic explosion soon erupted as the band broke into the title track from the same record, and the thrill ride did not stop until after 11 p.m.
The beginning of the set revolved mostly around the band’s latest material as it blasted through songs such as “Know Your Enemy,” “East Jesus Nowhere,” “Holiday,” “Letterbomb” and “Boulevard of Broken Dreams.” After the band announced it was recording a live album that night, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong asked the audience a simple question: “Are there any old-school Green Day fans in the house tonight?”
After raucous cheers, the band launched into 1994’s “Burnout” before playing other rare, classic gems, including “Scattered,” “F.O.D.,” “Paper Lanterns,” “2000 Light Years Away” and “J.A.R.” It even threw in a cover of Billy Idol’s “Dancing with Myself” in addition to the snippets of 10 other covers in its two medleys of the night. The medleys included AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell,” the Beatles’ “Hey Jude,” the Who’s “Baba O’Riley” and Tom Petty’s “Free Falling.”
All the while, Armstrong commandeered the crowd like a musical sergeant and his bandmates, bassist Mike Dirnt  and drummer Tré Cool, supplied an unbelievable amount of energy to go along with the top-notch renditions of every song played that evening. Armstrong described the night saying that “it doesn’t get better than this” as he celebrated with the large crowd of 16,000 fellow Californians.
“In this moment, right now,” he said, “there is no work, there is no school, there is no pain, there is no pressure, there is no responsibility. So let’s make it the night of our lives.”
After the band’s hilariously well-delivered performance of “King for a Day” and its cover of The Isley Brothers’ “Shout,” Armstrong reappeared with an acoustic guitar and began to play the emotional “21 Guns,” and the full band joined in to back him up. Next up was 2000’s smash hit anthem “Minority,” which the band extended to more than nine minutes long, including extended guitar solos, introductions and Armstrong’s traditional harmonica playing. As confetti rained down upon the audience during the final chorus, the screaming was deafening  — but the crowd’s singing along was even louder.
Green Day left the stage after “Minority” but the show was far from over as Armstrong declared “I’m not done yet” Their encore included 2004 hits “American Idiot” and the nine-minute epic “Jesus of Suburbia,” which ended with a raucous pyrotechnic display. Armstrong emerged from the darkness yet again armed with an acoustic guitar and the band broke into the final three songs of the night: “Last Night on Earth,” “Wake Me Up When September Ends” and the perfect closer “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).”
The best way to describe a Green Day show is to say that it is indescribable. Although many bands take pride in making large arena shows feel like small club shows, Green Day is able to take big shows and turn them into extravaganzas. There are fireworks, flames, confetti, toilet paper guns, T-shirt guns and water guns. They bring more than 100 fans on stage every night, and a few get to sing “Longview,” with the best singer receiving a guitar right off the shoulders of Armstrong. They bring small children on stage to be “saved,” and Armstrong can control the crowd without saying a single word: he will stand or sit down and stare at the crowd until the applause is so loud that all of California can hear it.
A person does not go see Green Day. A person goes to experience Green Day, whether that might be from the front row or the very back of the lawn. Just as the band puts its heart and soul into the music, the audience members find themselves doing exactly the same thing, and it is a truly amazing thing to be a part of it.
Clarification: 9/2/10 — An earlier version of this story misidentified two members of the backing band as members of Green Day. This entry has been corrected to reflect these changes.
Drien P: You’re wrong, as Nick points out in the article above that it was The Who’s song.  It was part of a medley of covers (“The medleys included…”).  You must not be familiar with the original(s).
It was an amazing show! Green Day is one of the best live performer. and “Teenage Wasteland’ is a new song that is coming out on there next album which they performed at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine.
Nice review, except that there’s no such song as “Teenage Wastland.”  I think that Nick meant “Baba O’Riley” from Who’s Next by the Who.

Competition is rising up over social media’s latest craze: geo-location. Designed for mobile users, geo-location allows you to share your location with friends.
There are several applications currently leading the geo-location bandwagon, including Foursquare, Gowalla and Facebook’s Places, which was introduced Aug. 18.
Not surprisingly, the feature, just more than one year old, is not yet widely used. However, no social media application has ever evolved overnight. Internet users need time to adapt and adjust to the hottest socially acceptable invasion of our privacy.
Remember the skepticism over Facebook? I was a sophomore in high school when I first heard about Facebook, and I thought it was unnecessary, creepy and a waste of time. Now I can’t open an Internet browser without my hands typing “www.facebook.com” by default.
It’s difficult to image a world without Facebook, and geo-location will become just as natural and regular for Internet fans.
My favorite geo-location application is Foursquare. Launched in March 2009, Foursquare originally targeted New York City’s nightlife. It was created to be a personalized radar used to find out which bars, clubs and restaurants were trending (meaning more than one person had checked in to the location) by friends. The developers quickly realized its potential and expanded the application to be used worldwide.
Using Foursquare is easy once you believe sharing your location with friends is normal. When you get to a new venue, all you have to do is select the Places tab in the mobile application to find your venue, and you also discover what is trending around you (Foursquare is available to multiple cell phone softwares, including the iPhone iOS, Android, webOS, Windows Phone 7 and BlackBerry OS). Wherever you go, be it the gym, a restaurant or even the 405 Freeway, known as L.A.’s parking lot, you can check yourself in, see who else is there and see where your friends are.
Upon checking in, you are prompted with the options to share your location with your Foursquare friends, as well as those on Facebook and Twitter. Users should not be too skeptical of checking in because they are in control of both the friends on their list and whether or not they share a check-in with friends. If you don’t want anyone to know where you are, then opt to keep your exact location private by not sharing it.
I used to share my Foursquare check-ins with my Twitter account until @Stalkmebot, a Twitter user who retweets geo-tags, retweeted my check-in at my home address.
Each check-in, whether shared or private, earns you points which can be used to unlock badges. Enough check-ins to the same venue and you could be dubbed the mayor — the person who frequents that venue the most. These game-like qualities of Foursquare were initially designed to provide incentive for users to continue using the application. However, businesses recently discovered Foursquare’s unique marketing potential.
Never before could businesses know what venues were trending and when, or who frequented them. Foursquare has unlocked a new platform for customer appreciation, but also customer dedication. Earlier this year, Foursquare partnered with companies such as Starbucks, Bravo TV, Zagat and The New York Times to offer special promotions and badges to users. For a brief time this summer, Starbucks offered a discount to “mayors” of their local coffeehouses. And now official Zagat tips are received when you check in to Zagat-reviewed restaurants, and enough check-ins can earn you the Zagat-sponsored “Foodie” badge.
At USC, Foursquare usage is growing. Since school has started, the check-ins for the USC campus, the new campus center and Leavey Library have been regularly trending. Perhaps Foursquare could even be a way of keeping attendance in the future.
Other social media developers are definitely acknowledging the power and potential of geo-location. Facebook’s newest Places feature, currently only available on the iPhone app and Facebook’s mobile website, could really expand the overall usage and popularity of geo-location.
Places is similar to Foursquare in that you check in wherever you are located. But unlike Foursquare, Places allows you to tag Facebook friends who are with you, and shares your location with all of your Facebook friends.
Facebook users could be Facebook friends with people whom they might not want to share their locations with. Foursquare provides a more intimate setting because you can hand-pick your friends based only on who you wish to regularly share your location with. Although all Facebook users may not utilize Places, the existence of the Places feature will contribute to the gradual adaptation of geo-location usage.
Sharing your location with the world can potentially be dangerous, so you have to be careful and conscious of how public make your updates. Still, everyone should be a frontrunner of this growing enterprise and get involved as soon as possible.

Great article. Geolocation based applications are definitely growing rapidly. Personally, I really love maps and the Google Maps API really makes me happy :)

On Aug. 31, Jenny Lewis and Jonathan Rice brought their new collaboration, Jenny & Johnny, to the Hollywood Amoeba Music store stage for a free, all-ages show coinciding with the release of their debut album, I’m Having Fun Now.
Lewis and Rice have wandered in and out of each other’s solo projects since 2006, when Lewis made the departure from Rilo Kiley’s hazy SoCal sound with the more country- and soul-inspired Rabbit Fur Coat. Rice also toured with Lewis in support of her 2008 album Acid Tongue, and shared writing credits on several of the tracks.
Power couple · The musical duet Jenny & Johnny plays an intimate show, premiering tracks from its new release I’m Having Fun Now. - James Watson | Daily Trojan
Although clearly a duo prior to Tuesday’s release, I’m Having Fun Now sees the two stake an equal and common claim in a project. They took center-stage side-by-side promptly at 6 p.m.
The warm, echoing timbre of their vocal duet was the dominant force of the show, at once soothing and electrifying. Add rolling guitar parts to the chorus-like refrains, and the show recalled 1960s-era California country-rock acts like The Flying Burrito Brothers.
Fans of Lewis already know and love her ability to portray defiance, exhaustion and humor with uncanny cohesion. During the song “My Pet Snakes,” her eyes guided the mesmerized crowd to the humor in the lyrics, her sorrowful gaze occasionally winking upwards into a revealing smirk. Although Rice tended to avert his gaze from the crowd, Lewis used hers to serve almost as an ambassador for their songs.
The worst thing that could be said about this show was the low degree of variety. The songs sound very similar to one another, although this is ultimately also a positive aspect. Too often bands release infectious singles that sound nothing like the albums they lure listeners to buy. Those songs get overplayed and robbed of their magic, as fans yearn for something new and mystically similar-yet-different.
Overall, the show had no low point — each tune was stylistically consistent and expertly delivered. Jenny & Johnny’s style, throughout its various permutations, remained rebellious, sweet and spirited. The band as a whole was tight and precise, leaving no space for quality comparisons of the live show and the record.
Tuesday’s show was fun, catchy and comforting. Admirably this was executed without any sacrifices of songwriting, precision or style. The performance was the first of many on its 2010 tour, leaving ample time to get on board with Jenny & Johnny’s love affair. They won’t steer you astray, but as Lewis declares in “My Pet Snakes,” I’ll sink this ship if I want.”
Sounds like a good albulm to invest in — thanks for the review!

“World of Warcraft kills 15,000 people every year,” said James Ellias, president of the USC Objectivist Club, with a laugh. I asked him how he came up with such a mesmerizing statistic, and he proceeded to blow my mind.
The average “WoW” subscriber plays 10 hours a week, and something like 11 million users are currently subscribed, many of whom are actively playing at any given moment. That’s a lot of man-hours of Warcraft each week. Divide that by the number of hours in a week, and you get approximately 15,000 human lifespans used, per year, on Warcraft.

Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
“In terms of death rate, its going to be ranked up there with heart-disease,” Ellias said.
As humorous as that might sound, it begs a valid question: Are we wasting our lives in virtual environments? Or can we consider games to be a valid and constructive use of our time?
Consider PlayStation Home, a unique social gaming network that allows users to create their own custom avatar and interact with others in a massive alternate reality. Users can customize their avatars and decorate their private apartment (or “Home Space”) with default, won or even bought items.
Why is this becoming such a common trend?  It seems absurd to spend physical money on a virtual world. However, with more than 12 million users worldwide and counting, Home is no joke. Some of the landscapes and architectural feats are actually prettier than their real-life counterparts. It’s beyond real — it’s surreal. Virtual reality is becoming so extensive that part of it actually serve to replace our physical lives, and not in a good way.
We now have a plethora of virtual communities, from PlayStation Home to Second Life to Farmville, as well as many online games on massive community servers, such as World of Warcraft, RuneScape, Everquest and EVE. All of these “universes” are expanding and looking more appealing every day. But what will happen when our virtual alternatives are more attractive than our actual reality?
The need to make money, you might say, will prevent us from spending the majority of our lives online. How can we play games all day when there’s bacon to be brought home?
This is where it gets disturbing.
A form of commerce already thrives on Second Life, with millions of dollars in transactions every year. It is entirely self-sustainable monetarily, which makes it more than just a fantasy land. Second Life promises a better life than the one you currently live — “Who will you be? What will you discover? Anything is possible in Second Life … A whole new world is awaiting.”
You can dress your avatar in the latest clothes from the Second Life Fall Fashion Lookbook, you can purchase your own developed private island and host extravagant parties with your friends. Yes, you can even fall in love with other Second Life users in some cases.
Still, that doesn’t make it real.
As vain as the real world can be at times, how much more vain is this?
Yet, with museums, art, learning environments and networking events, Second Life does seem to offer something productive. Wherever people are, there is money to be made — even in virtual reality.
The future is only going to bring more advancements in gaming technologies, especially in the realm of graphics, virtual reality (the headset wearing kind), haptic systems and immersive environments. When virtual reality becomes widely commercial and practical for the everyday consumer, time spent in alternate realities such as PlayStation Home and Second Life will most certainly increase.
Home is already a very real and immersive social environment for the online community — imagine what will happen when people are too immersed to stop?
It gets better. Although PlayStation Home was originally considered to be a social network for gamers, it is now considered to be a game platform in itself. The first game that was widely released just for Home. The first virtual world-based alternate reality game for the console was called Xi, made by nDreams. Because of Xi, the number of Home users is estimated to exceed 5 million people.
“I really think we have brought the community together like never before,” said Patrick O’Luanaigh, founder of nDreams, in an online interview titled “The Making of Xi”. But what was unique about the Xi experience was that people from various countries and cultures had to work together to win the game.
“We actually had crossover between the language forums, which I’ve never seen happen before,” O’Luanaigh said. Millions of people crossed cultural boundaries and language barriers for a common cause — to solve Xi.
So can these alternate realities be considered a waste of time? New businesses, new relationships and new ways to learn have sprouted from them. That would not be possible in the real world. They unify people from a diverse range of demographics and allow for worldwide collaboration to solve common problems. Real-world commerce occurs in these virtual worlds, with real-world consequences. Can all this be considered productive, or should we be more careful as consumers?
These games are more than just addictions. They are changing our world, moving us all online little by little.

Imagine if USC’s campus was happily situated in Malibu or Orange County. If  USC had the option to move to one of these communities — arguably a more ideal environment than Downtown Los Angeles — many a student probably would chose, without hesitance, a new locale.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
President Steven B. Sample wouldn’t. When faced with the same dilemma in the early 1990s.  He chose to keep the campus where it belonged — even in the midst of Los Angeles riots. It was probably one of the best executive decisions he made.
USC’s recent designation as an “international safe community” by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre on Community Safety Promotion shows that USC — and the surrounding community — thrives not only in spite of, but because of, its urban setting. The university isn’t merely the largest private employer in the city of Los Angeles, it is the catalyst for the continual economic development of Southern California.
This honor shows faculty, students and prospective applicants that USC’s urban location is an opportunity, not an obstruction, for all those affiliated with it. Sample knew this when he assumed office. And President C. L. Max Nikias must build upon this momentum with his own vision for the university’s role in civic engagement, neighborhood partnerships and widespread community outreach.
As the first university community in the world to be designated as an international safe community, USC is clearly on the move toward debunking a prevailing myth: that the campus is woefully beset by its location in the middle of a dangerous, crime-ridden neighborhood. Charles Lane, associate senior vice president for Career and Protective Services at USC, said this honor “helps underscore the fact that safety in our community is a collective effort and responsibility.”
Not only are the university’s role in neighborhood improvements a necessity, but they are also an opportunity for service-minded students to grow according to the mission statement already established by USC, which states the university’s central purpose as “the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.”
USC students have an extraordinary opportunity to put their respective skills to work through many public service options available to us within walking distance. Whether it’s conducting research at a local health clinic, assisting in fundraising efforts for a neighborhood project or raising awareness of local hunger and homelessness through a documentary or, students don’t have to reach far to find these opportunities. Although academic and professional learning is an essential component to our development, putting that learning to work through community service is another mission crucial to enriching our minds and the values of the Trojan Family.
No need to look further than our campus-held involvement fairs to see how far the university has come in community outreach. From high school mentoring groups to social justice organizations to associations providing major-related public service, USC students are leading the way. Of course, a majority of universities might have similar programs in place. But USC’s convenient location in the heart of Los Angeles is the edge we have that the others do not, which has led to the extraordinary number of achievements within our community increasing every day.
In education, USC’s partnership with the Family of Schools has been an great success. Because of this collaboration, several of these schools have been designated California Distinguished Schools.
In our neighborhood relations, USC plays a vital role in the physical quality and health of our surrounding communities. Since 1994, the well-known Good Neighbors Campaign has more than quadrupled in voluntary contributions from staff and faculty.
And in economic development, local businesses have been created — and have thrived — in large part because of our efforts with such organizations as the Marshall School’s Business Expansion Network.
Some might say that our location continues to be a major liability. A liability for whom? USC’s elevated level of service to our community has not been unrequited. In fact, by transforming the potential obstacles of our current location in Los Angeles into advantages, we have received enormous praise through private investment and national recognition — such as our recent designation as an international safe community.
As a private research university constantly in search of grants, partnerships and, most importantly, the best students in the United States, recognition such as this allows us to stand out from the rest. The university’s heavy investment in the development of our surrounding community is not in vain. It is a win-win situation.
USC is setting the standard for what it means to be a civically engaged university in the 21st century. The university is also showing by example what it means for a college and a community to work symbiotically to improve our quality of life. Although it does not mean we should stop here, all USC affiliates should be proud of the Trojan Family standing by its mission of playing “an increasingly important role in the development of the nation and the world.”
Do the university another service. Next time a friend back home blithely remarks that USC is “in the ghetto,” tell them the complete story.
Stephen Zelezny is a sophomore majoring in public relations. His column, “USC on the Move,” runs Thursdays.
There was that grad student stabbed off campus  a couple of years ago.  What other USC students have been murdered?
And this isn’t the 90s anymore.  Blue and red plaid shirts are now hipster attire.  
tjay makes it sound like USC is some sort of battlefield for crips & bloods.  Look again, cousin.
Stephen-Do you ACTUALLY think the families of those who have had their loved ones Murdered while at USC can find solace in your words? Get out of your puffy dream word & graduate. This is the real world & Crips + Bloods live in OUR ‘hood. This IS a Ghetto. If you were a truthful journalist, you’d call a spade a spade. Political Correctness has blinded yet another Trojan from seeing the Truth.
To any Trojan who might suggest moving the campus (as over the decades have many O.C. Trojans – some still do) to a “better” location, I would suggest (as a 3rd generation alumnus) that they reconsider. Would Columbia move from Morningside Heights (aka Harlem), Penn from inner-city Philadelphia, Yale from the “bad part” of New Haven? Our alma mater’s proximity to Downtown Los Angeles is an asset not a liability. “Get over it” would be my advice to any student, faculty member, administrator or “newcomer” who might not like the locale we have always called University Park.

A tri-sport athlete — football, basketball and track and field — George Farmer is a talented high school athlete. More importantly to USC however, is that Farmer, a prized football recruit, is heavily favoring the Trojans in his college search.
At 6 feet 2 inches tall and 210 pounds, Farmer is currently a wide receiver for Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, Calif. and despite the recent troubles facing USC — including the postseason ban and decrease in athletic scholarhips — Farmer has reportedly said he is strongly considering the Trojans as an option for next year.
Farmer’s high school football team, the Cavaliers, won the state title last year, going 15-0. As a junior that season, Farmer scored 12 touchdowns and had 41 catches for 891 yards, in addition to running for 116 yards and four touchdowns. He has also played a bit on defense for Serra, making him a viable option as a cornerback in college.
An announcement on his decision is expected in January.
this coud be a recruiting violation.  You can’t write stuff about recruits on a school website.

Overcrowding at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center reached “dangerous” levels this summer, according to the Los Angeles Times.
From June to July, the hospital went from four hours of “dangerous” overcrowding to eight hours at the end of July, the Department of Health Services reported.
This comes at a time when the county is considering cutting off Medicare funds to the hospital, it announced on Tuesday.
Hospital officials say they are doing their best, however, with the limited resources and beds.
“Currently, we have eked out high efficiency in a facility that has reached its maximum capacity,” said Dr. Stephanie Hall, the hospital chief medical officer, in the Times. “Until we have additional capacity, we predict this will continue…. Our capacity remains finite.”
The county predicts a $600 million deficit its health care budget for the next year.

Believe it or not, some people are against “going green” for the sake of business. The plastic grocery bag ban — Assembly Bill 1998 — did not pass in California legislature Tuesday night.
Although the California Assembly passed the measure in June, the plastic bag industry has since created a massive advertising campaign against the proposal. Had the measure passed, California would have been the first state to ban plastic bags, though many cities have done so. San Francisco was the first city to ban the use of plastic grocery bags in 2007.
“California is poised to lead a national movement against plastic bag pollution that is injuring and killing marine life and imposing a costly blight on our land,” Assemblywoman Julia Brownley, the Democrat representing Santa Monica who authored the bill, told The Christian Science Monitor.
After the bill failed, Brownley had other words for the Los Angeles Times.
“I think we missed a great opportunity,” she said.
If the ban does one day pass, it could go into effect as early as 2012 for large retail and grocery stores, and in 2013 for smaller retailers.

To say that this has been an eventful offseason for the USC football team would be a vast understatement.  Since their last game, a 24-13 Emerald Bowl victory over Boston College, the Trojans have weathered a change in coaching staff, several defections from both teammates and heralded recruits and a stunningly severe set of punishments imposed by the NCAA — including a postseason bowl ban, reduction in scholarships and forfeiture of wins from the Reggie Bush era.
The aftershocks of this hammer blow are still being felt, with team awards being stripped and individual honors — namely Bush’s Heisman Trophy — in jeopardy of being rescinded as well.
And yet, amid all the chaos, this year’s team will try to take the first steps toward restoring the program to a state of normalcy in their season opener versus the University of Hawai’i on Thursday night.
We want to know:
Will the mood on gameday be noticeably subdued this year?  Or, will the Trojan spirit continue to pulse through the campus in spite of a season with a known expiration date?
Taking all of the events of the offseason into consideration, most notably the NCAA sanctions, what is your level of excitement for the upcoming football season?
