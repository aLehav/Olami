USC freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu has declared for the 2020 NBA Draft, he announced in a statement posted on Twitter Wednesday.
“I want to take the next step when the opportunity presents itself,” Okongwu said. “With careful consideration, I am announcing that I am declaring for the 2020 NBA Draft. I appreciate everyone who has helped me get to this point.”
Okongwu will enter the draft as one of the most highly touted freshmen in the country. He led the Pac-12 in field goal percentage and finished second in the conference in blocks per game. Okongwu’s efforts helped the Trojans secure a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament as a No. 4 seed, and USC likely would have earned a spot in March Madness for the first time since 2017.
“My freshman campaign at [USC] has been nothing short of spectacular,” Okongwu said. “To the fans at Galen, thank you for the consistent love and support every time I stepped on the court.”
Okongwu is expected to be the fourth Trojan drafted into the NBA in the past three years, with De’Anthony Melton and Chimezie Metu drafted in 2018 and Kevin Porter Jr. drafted in 2019. The Chino native is also expected to be the first lottery pick out of USC since DeMar DeRozan in 2009.
“To [head coach Andy] Enfield, [associate head coach Jason] Hart, [assistant coaches Chris] Capko and [Eric] Mobley, I want to thank you for letting a kid from Chino into your program,” Okongwu said. “To my brothers on the team, the love and bond I have for you guys is real and it’s something I will always keep close to me.”
Okongwu will also join former Trojans Dewayne Dedmon, Taj Gibson, Jordan McLaughlin and Nikola Vucevic in the world’s most premier basketball league.
Though the NBA regular season has been postponed indefinitely, the draft lottery and draft itself are both still set to take place as scheduled.
The 2020 NBA Draft Lottery will be televised May 19 from Chicago, Ill. and the subsequent NBA Draft will take place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. June 25.

Early on in the shutdown of the sports world, I spent many of my waking hours trying to find a silver lining. I struggled. 
But over the course of approximately the last week, I found it, and since I did, it has become more and more painfully obvious with each passing day.
I’ve noticed a number of ways fans have tried to fill this gaping hole left in our hearts by the lack of sports. Rewatching old classics, intense gaming and indoor 3-point contests with toilet paper and a laundry hamper are some. 
That’s all good and well. But don’t miss this opportunity to pay closer attention to some of the things that will have a much wider and longer-lasting impact on our world than the suspension of the NBA, delay of MLB or cancelation of NCAA spring competition. That is, flip off ESPN’s Slippery Stairs broadcast (which, I admit, is entertaining), and flip on the news. 
You know — the news that talks about the whole global pandemic thing that caused this societal shutdown in the first place, how many lives it has claimed and will likely claim in the near future, what scientific and social strategies have been taken around the world to flatten the curve — not the news that quibbles over which team Jameis Winston will throw 80 interceptions for next year or what number his (washed) successor will wear on the road to his couch to watch the playoffs.
More specifically, flip on the type of news that, if you’re paying any attention, reaffirms time and time again how much the current administration here in America lacks both the decency and the brains to properly deal with this crisis. 
Think about the asymptomatic NBA players that have been tested for the virus while your average American citizen with anything short of life-threatening symptoms can’t. Think about the fact that we don’t have enough masks or respirators to protect the healthcare workers risking their lives to treat the sick. Think about the fact that these exact fucking problems were predicted by a mock epidemic conducted by experts and former officials in May 2018, the same month President Donald Trump blew up a National Security Council unit specifically intended to prepare for the threat of a pandemic because, evidently, that threat seemed minimal. Oops!
Think about the fact that the president was asked by a reporter how to calm the anxieties of Americans rightfully terrified by the outbreak — quite possibly the easiest question a president can answer in times like these — to which he responded, “You’re a terrible reporter … I don’t call it ‘Comcast,’ I call it ‘Concast.’”
Think about the fact that South Korea and the United States each had their first reported confirmed case on Jan. 20, and that one of those countries has mitigated the spread of the virus about as effectively as physically possible, while the other country is the United States.
If everything must be framed within the context of sports, fine: They’re playing baseball again in South Korea.
I miss sports incredibly. The other day I filled out a hypothetical March Madness bracket and used a random number generator to simulate the entire tournament. I’ve watched the 2019 and 2018 Philadelphia Phillies video yearbooks on YouTube the last two days, and I plan to watch the 2017 one shortly after I finish writing this column. 
I’ll do whatever I can to approach my necessary daily sports fix, and you should too — but don’t get sucked in. Don’t let it prevent you from tuning in to the other things that matter. You’ve been sitting on your ass for the last week because that’s essentially all you’re legally allowed to do. You miss sports and no matter how many 1993 NBA playoff games you watch, you’ll still miss sports. Accept this reality. Watch the news.
If there was ever a good time for the suspension of sports due to a global pandemic (there’s not), it’s now. This administration has failed its people often for the last three years, but what better time to notice that most glaringly than right before we have the chance to replace it with a new one?!
The failures of President Trump and his cabinet are on full display right before our very eyes. They’re really not trying to hide them — or at least, they aren’t doing a very good job at it — and we have no sports to give us an excuse not to pay attention.
If this doesn’t spur the political participation that our country is so clearly lacking, I really don’t know what will.
For the time being, sports are gone, and that sucks. But meanwhile, the response to the crisis by our president — which sucks even more — continues to reveal the glaring shortcomings within the current administration, and the absence of sports is giving us a perfect opportunity to realize them. I hope you take advantage of that.

The workers’ union UNITE HERE Local 11 is demanding that USC guarantee full pay and benefits to its hospitality, custodial and maintenance staff during the coronavirus outbreak, which is leaving many unable to perform their jobs, the union wrote in a petition that surfaced Thursday and has garnered more than 2,000 signatures. 
The petition comes in light of a University email sent to the USC community initially announcing that employees would be eligible for two weeks of paid administrative leave. In another campuswide email, published after the release of the petition, the University announced that the leave policy will be extended to four weeks before workers would need to use saved-up vacation days for continued pay. 
Despite this development, UNITE HERE Local 11 communications representative Maria Hernandez said the union is still pushing for the demands laid out in the petition. 
The policy will leave workers and their families in an economic crisis if they are not guaranteed full pay for as long as the coronavirus crisis continues, according to the petition.  
“As we have learned in recent months, many of these workers already live paycheck-to-paycheck in a city that is increasingly unaffordable,” it read. “They take care of us throughout the year and now, in this difficult time, it is our turn to take care of them.”
USC has not yet responded directly to the petition, Hernandez said, but the union hopes the University becomes aware of it, especially as it gains traction. 
“We just want to get the word out as much as possible,” Hernandez said. “The more submissions that we get, the more helpful it is because it’ll show the workers that we [support them] … We’re going to continue to make sure that USC workers are being taken care of during this crisis and we’re hoping the University will listen.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC wrote that it will continue to evaluate different options to help its workers during the pandemic. 
“We will continue to pay attention to federal and local support options that may be provided [to] all employees, as we evaluate strategies and inform our employees of pay continuation options,” the statement read. “As more information becomes available in this rapidly changing landscape, we will update our community.”
UNITE HERE Local 11 has been working to secure higher wages and a 40-hour work week for USC Hospitality and Housing workers in ongoing contract negotiations since Nov. 13. USC is currently working with UNITE HERE Local 11 to ensure a fair agreement with workers. 
“I think the University definitely needs to protect workers right now during this crisis, but I think workers also definitely need a sustainable solution besides these crises,” said Ada Marys Lorenzana, a member of the student committee of UNITE HERE Local 11. “That goes for giving them a fair contract, which is really what we’re urging for — especially during times like now.”

Amid the panic and confusion following USC’s decision to move classes online in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Veronica Marks took to organizing resources for struggling students. 
Marks, a junior majoring in screenwriting, first posted on social media March 12 asking students who were leaving campus to donate leftover food to low-income students. Marks has since collected hundreds of donations at their home off campus to help those struggling to pay for meals. 
“Any time that situations are rapidly changing and the needs of people are rapidly changing, I think sometimes we need to move independently of bureaucracy and officiality,” Marks said. 
The outpouring of student support for the food drive led Marks to create a mutual aid spreadsheet, which documents resources available for students, including housing, food and transportation services. Students can edit the spreadsheet to offer help with tasks such as buying groceries for immunocompromised students or to ask for assistance with storage and housing. 
Jessica Moreno, a freshman majoring in business administration, has visited the food drive twice to help support her family. Moreno’s mother works in the restaurant industry and has been laid off due to coronavirus concerns, making it difficult for her family to afford meals. 
“There was a lot of stress about how are we going to get food or basic needs, so the [food drive] definitely helped,” Moreno said. 
Marks adapted the spreadsheet based off of the work of student activists at the University of Michigan and Middlebury College. They said the lack of decisive action from the administration to address food and financial insecurity inspired them to start enlisting the help of fellow students. 
“The whole point of this is that there was no infrastructure in place to take care of these needs,” Marks said. “Therefore, the response to it isn’t as bureaucratic or clearly delegated or organized, but it is extremely passionate.” 
While the spreadsheet primarily coordinates help for USC students in need, it also provides housing availability for students from the Claremont Colleges, a consortium of seven private colleges near Los Angeles that includes Harvey Mudd and Pomona colleges. 
The administration at the Claremont Colleges told students to leave university housing immediately March 18, leaving many low-income and LGBTQ students living in abusive households without a place to stay. Marks said they reached out to activists from the Occupy Pomona movement, which advocates for continued living on campus for vulnerable students, to help organize rooms for students experiencing homelessness. 
“USC students will be voluntarily leaving the area because of USC going online, and a lot of people should be going home, and that means there’s rooms, there’s apartments, there’s beds empty,” Marks said.
The spreadsheet allows USC students to list their available housing and contact information for students to reach out. Currently, 25 students are offering spaces, with four listings at full capacity. 
Lucy Allen, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, is offering her single bedroom in a shared house on the spreadsheet. Allen said she felt compelled to help others during this tumultuous period. 
“In a time like this, in which a lot of people are in crisis, it’s important to look at what you do have access to and what resources you can extend to other people,” Allen said. 
Allen learned about the spreadsheet from Marks’ Instagram and has received queries from Claremont students about moving into her space, which is now at full capacity.
In addition to sharing the spreadsheet on social media, Marks wrote a letter detailing resources for food-insecure and immunocompromised students and sent it to several USC academic deans and department heads. Marks also encouraged their social media followers to share the information with students in their classes on Blackboard. 
Marks contacted the administration in hopes of promoting the spreadsheet’s resources through their communication channels. While Marks hasn’t received an official response from administrators, Undergraduate Student Government posted a link to the spreadsheet on its coronavirus resources website page. 
The University plans to advocate its own projects for low-income students, USC told the Daily Trojan in a statement. 
“The university is promoting an initiative run by Student Affairs through the Student Affairs’ Student Basic Needs Office,” the statement read. “The team there centralizes resources for students who are food, housing, and financially insecure.”
USG President Trenton Stone said he hoped publishing the spreadsheet on the organization’s website would help market and formalize the activists’ efforts. 
“It just touched me and just makes me proud to be a part of this Trojan Family in a time of crisis,” Stone said. 
Samantha Kosai, a senior majoring in sociology, is a part of a basic needs task force Marks organized to spread the word about resources for students. Kosai said that as a low-income student, she wanted to help other students facing financial insecurity.
“When [Veronica] mentioned that they needed help organizing and had a vision for a lot more of what they wanted to do to help these insecure students, I knew that was something I wanted to be a part of,” Kosai said. “At the end of the day, that meant I was helping people like myself.” 
While Kosai felt the University adequately communicated its coronavirus response, she said the administration failed to consider the needs of low-income students. 
“A lot of times students like myself, who are living out here as independents, who might be facing food or housing insecurity, we’re already falling through the cracks in so many places that the University doesn’t address when there’s no pandemic,” Kosai said. “But, then to be in such a frightening time globally and especially in L.A., to not really have any resources for us is both frustrating and sad.” 
Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Jennifer de la Fuente said she heard about the spreadsheet through an Annenberg Media Center Slack channel and decided to forward the resources to her students through Blackboard announcements. While de la Fuente is no longer offering her office as a storage space due to restricted access to campus, she continues to promote the work of the student activists. 
“I think that it speaks a lot to the community, just to the community of students, people really are looking out for each other,” de la Fuente said. “I think, rightly or wrongly, USC has a reputation of being full of spoiled children … but I think in times like this, it really does show that we’re not that reputation.”

For Maria Morales, commencement represents the culmination of nearly two decades of work. From elementary school to her last semester at USC, graduation is a testament to her dedication, a love letter to her family and an ode to the chapter she is closing.
“As a first-gen college student, these four years have really been a journey of self-discovery and growth,” said Morales, a senior majoring in global health. “And I was looking forward to commencement, not just because it’s like a rite of passage or anything, but because it was really symbolic of four years of hard work. Not just four years, but it was like 16 years … to be able to walk that stage and really validate that everything had been for a reason.”
But the reality is much more complex for seniors like Morales as universities across the country close their doors and shut down campuses to control the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic. USC has postponed commencement until concern over the virus lessens and, for now, will hold a series of virtual events with featured speakers on the original May 15 commencement date. 
In the meantime, seniors have been left uncertain of their next steps. With graduation postponed indefinitely, friendships abruptly disrupted and futures on hold, the Class of 2020 did not expect their last semester at USC to unfold as it has. 
“Once this whole coronavirus situation started, I did not think that they were going to [postpone] graduation,” said Sloan Pecchia, a senior majoring in music industry. “And I don’t think really anyone did because of how quickly this has escalated. I think everyone … felt OK about the fact that we were just gonna try Zoom classes and then be back … and that is not what happened.”
For Pecchia, attending USC seemed like a distant goal — until her dream was realized on acceptance day in March 2016. As Pecchia progressed through her academic years, she became more certain of the University’s deep imprint on her life. For her, and so many others, graduation is the end of an era, a last hurrah before everything changes and a hallmark of the success waiting outside the University’s gates.
“I envisioned [commencement] just as closure for myself because the last four years have been really great, but they also have been filled with a lot of obstacles and challenges that I would not have seen coming, if you would have told me four years ago,” Pecchia said. “So I saw it not just as closure but as a day to close this chapter of my life and be able to start a new one.”
On commencement day, eager seniors move deftly from one place to the next, darting in and out of their school’s commencement lines, greeting family and friends and shaking hands with the veteran faculty who shaped their college experience. The ceremony, which brings nearly 80,000 people to campus annually, has the community moving in harmony, united in celebration of the graduating class’ hard-won feat.
“We know how important an in-person commencement is to our seniors, other graduates, and their families and friends,” said President Carol Folt in a schoolwide email announcing the changes. “You’ve been planning for years for the special moments of celebration and gratitude that commencement provides for friends, teachers, and loved ones.”
Before USC made a decision about the status of commencement, anxiety over graduation was amplified as universities such as Cal State Los Angeles canceled the celebration and others such as Northeastern University opted for a virtual ceremony. As the University quickly moved to limit travel and pull students from study abroad programs, it remained silent about the inevitable changes it would make to graduation; seniors, increasingly concerned about the probability of not being able to walk the stage — donning the traditional black gowns with diplomas in hand — created a petition signed by more than 3,800 people calling for USC to postpone rather than cancel the event. 
Although commencement wasn’t canceled, many seniors felt disheartened by the postponement, as their families and friends had already booked flight arrangements and planned vacations months in advance.
Alexis Nguyen’s grandfather from the Philippines, whom she has not seen since 2016, bought tickets to come see her graduate. Taylor Finley-Ponds’ extended relatives already booked flights from Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas to attend commencement, tour the city and celebrate with cookouts, restaurant dinners and other festivities. Pecchia, who is from New Jersey, planned for her hometown friends to attend. 
And for most, crossing the stage is more than the ability to cross the accomplishment off a to-do list. For Finley-Ponds, celebrating graduation is for her mother, who never got the chance to go to college, and for her younger siblings, to let them know that higher education isn’t out of reach. This was an accomplishment Finley-Ponds’ had earned amid family challenges such as homelessness.
“[Commencement is] just a time for everybody to come together and kind of not just celebrate me but also get to see each other and see what this accomplishment means to us and my family,” said Finley-Ponds, who is majoring in business administration. “The reason why I came to college was to be a role model for my siblings and let them know college is for kids like us, and this is possible.”
Similarly, graduation is a time when Morales can uplift her relatives and heritage. Morales, who is president of Latino Students in Medicine, was planning to apply to speak at the Latinx Graduation Ceremony — a commencement event conducted fully in Spanish and without the main event’s four-person cap, perfect for her eight-person family flying in from Mexico. 
“[The ceremony is] something that a lot of us were looking forward to, just because family is really important,” Morales said. “They’re the ones that have really pushed me to be here.”
USC has not made any decisions regarding whether in-person commencement will contain the same cultural and school-specific ceremonies it traditionally does, according to a University spokesperson. 
For many seniors, the feeling of missing out on traditional experiences is ubiquitous. The University canceled Springfest, the annual spring concert, and many members of the graduating class didn’t get a chance to live out their final moments on campus as USC students. Marsuk Dilla, a senior majoring in accounting, never took his graduation photos at Mudd Hall, a popular location for soon-to-be-grads, as he had planned. 
While much of the Class of 2020 applauds the University’s decision to not outright cancel commencement, seniors don’t understand the logistics of an online graduation ceremony nor its feasibility and feel the remote aspect makes the celebration impersonal. The decision to postpone graduation festivities was made following Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order limiting all nonessential movement and the Los Angeles County recommendation to halt gatherings of 10 or more people.
For Nguyen, a first-generation low-income student, USC provided ample opportunities to form strong ties with her peers and make connections with faculty, which led to her current position as a post-production clerk at Netflix. As a December graduate, she said she was looking forward to walking with her friends and doesn’t see the benefits of an additional virtual commencement.
“I honestly don’t really understand how virtual commencement is going to work,” Nguyen said. “I saw that they said that they’re gonna have speakers and all that, but … I would want for all that to happen in an in-person commencement but I understand they’re just trying to accommodate for our planned date.”
USC has not yet made a decision on how it will conduct virtual commencement nor regarding whether all of the traditional events will be available to students on an online platform, a University spokesperson said. It also has not chosen the platform on which the celebration will be led.
“The whole point of graduation to me is like a sense of community and being able to finish something together,” Pecchia said. “And I have a feeling virtual graduation is just gonna be like me in front of my laptop alone — so it’ll be interesting.”
Pecchia, along with Finley-Ponds, agreed that while virtual commencement isn’t ideal, she is glad the University decided to listen to students and their graduation concerns. In a recent email, Folt announced USC will make a webpage dedicated to frequently asked questions about commencement, including regalia rentals and purchases. The page will be posted later this week.  
And while the Class of 2020 remains hopeful about commencement, its members are still healing from the wounds of a semester, and storylines, left unfinished. 
Finley-Ponds said she felt her life was cut short when she abruptly left campus. Having built solidarity as a resident of Somerville Place, the Black student cultural floor in Fluor Tower, and as the president of the Iota Beta USC chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first sorority for Black women, she hopes she’ll reconnect with her friends when commencement takes place.
“It is difficult when you just kind of up and leave and … [I want to put] just kind of emphasis on the friendships and everybody just having to leave and live their lives just suddenly is kind of a big deal, also,” she said. “So I think the graduation would also be a time for everyone to get together as far as students and be able to see their faculty and staff that they didn’t get to say goodbye to.”
While Pecchia expects a similar graduation experience simply at a later date, she believes students may not have the same commencement experience, since spring semester events, such as the Annenberg New Alumni Reception and the African American Cultural Celebration, surrounding commencement build up an atmosphere of anticipation leading up to graduation.
“I think the really unfortunate thing about the postponement is that I really hope but I don’t know if everyone who I would have graduated with will come back,” Pecchia said. “And I think that that’s a really bittersweet part.”
Nguyen added that she wants commencement to simulate not only every other graduation in the past, but also reflect the Class of 2020’s unique, difficult college experience — from dealing with the University’s various scandals, including former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s sexual misconduct and USC’s involvement in the college admissions bribery scheme, as well as the tragedy of the nine student deaths last semester and senior Victor McElhaney’s death last spring.
“I really hope that nothing is going to be taken away from that experience, as in I want it to be treated as if it was a regular main commencement,” Nguyen said. “I also expect for there to be some kind of recognition of what the Class of 2020 had to go through.”

During the fourth inning of a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs in April 1976, two fans suddenly ran onto Dodger Stadium’s outfield carrying an American flag and a lighter. Before they could make their political statement, Cubs center fielder Rick Monday ran from behind and scooped up the flag to keep it out of harm’s way.
Up in an employee box, then-USC undergraduate Jeff Fellenzer was running the message board. As the incident on the field unfolded, his boss, Fred Claire, turned to him and told him to display something for the fans to see.
“Rick Monday … you made a great play,” the board read.
The message was captured in a fan’s video and is now considered part of a signature moment in baseball history. Claire said he believes the words are some of the most meaningful in the history of Dodger Stadium. Now an associate professor at USC, Fellenzer recounted the experience in his office at Wallis Annenberg Hall. 
“There’s so many great stories in sports, and I’m trying to bring some of those stories to the classroom,” Fellenzer said.
Although he was raised in Long Beach and developed into a sports junkie during his childhood, Fellenzer didn’t solidify his fan loyalty to USC until he committed to the University. His mother, Sue Fellenzer, graduated from UCLA and worked in education for over 50 years while raising Jeff on her own. He credits his mother for his work ethic and for introducing him to the man who would become a staple in his life and, later, his classroom: legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden.
Fellenzer grew close to the coach over the course of a decade before Wooden’s death in 2010, frequenting Wooden’s residence with his fellow sports fanatic friends to talk sports, life and wisdom. Meanwhile, Fellenzer was creating one of the most popular classes at USC.
After jobs with the Dodgers, CBS Sports and the NFL, Fellenzer started as an adjunct professor at USC in 1990, taking over the only sports media class offered at USC at the time: “Sports Reporting.” The class was previously taught by former Sports Illustrated writer Joe Jares, and Fellenzer modeled his class in a similar mold while also writing for the Los Angeles Times. 
However, he started to change the narrative of what his role as a professor meant. Inviting guest speakers from the field became a habit for Fellenzer, who took a class centered around the writing and details of sports reporting and broadened its message through the use of voices with varying roles in the industry. 
“I wanted them to get to know people like I did that could be influential in their lives, [who could] tell them their story and share their expertise, and then also perhaps be a good contact for them,” Fellenzer said. “So I started to do that, and it really wasn’t done much [before].”
The approach caught the attention of Joe Saltzman, then the associate director of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, who Fellenzer credits with the creation of the “Sports, Business, Media” class that Fellenzer is best known for at USC. As the school looked to the turn of the century, Saltzman was charged with creating classes focusing on specific genres of journalism. 
What he came up with was an accumulation of students’ interests in entertainment and sports through the two lenses of business and media, and Fellenzer was the perfect candidate to tackle the hybrid job.
“He knew the sports media inside and out, and by covering sports, he had learned a good deal about the business of sports,” Saltzman said. “He was the perfect teacher for the course.”
Spring 1999 was the pilot semester for the course. Needing a co-professor to help with the broad scope of content, Fellenzer recruited his former boss Claire, who had just been fired as the Dodgers’ general manager after an underperforming season. With the combination of both professors’ experience and expertise in sports, the class became a home run for any student looking to get their foot in the door of the competitive field.
Since Claire departed the class in 2001, Fellenzer has led what is now one of USC’s most sought-after classes: “Sports, Business, Media” was one of the University’s five highest-rated classes according to a 2012 student survey.
“If you had the students grade Jeff and he got anything other than an A+ or the highest mark available, I would be shocked,” Claire said.
The buzz around the class stems from the extensive guest list that reads as a who’s who of influential people in the sports industry. Wooden, who appeared three times, has been honored with “Weekly Wooden” segments that include the coach’s life lessons and wisdom, which students are then tested on. 
Some other notable speakers include the group panel of Olympic broadcasters Jim Nantz, Jim Lampley and Dick Enberg, Olympian and USC alum Louis Zamperini, former USC football coach Pete Carroll and NBA legend Jerry West. The list includes both headline makers and the people behind the cameras of the sports scene, but all serve a purpose in displaying what it takes to be successful in one of the most competitive media industries.
Students have the opportunity to not only listen to speakers but network with them as well. While Fellenzer’s class has an official run time of almost three hours, students will line up afterward to connect with speakers and Fellenzer himself to ask questions, discuss career opportunities or just talk sports one-on-one. 
“Anytime you see the conversation you have with him is so genuine,” said Aron Cohen, a junior majoring in communication. “He actually cares and listens to every word and everything you’re saying … He actually wants to help you [at] any time. It’s something that I’ve noticed. Every time that I’ve talked to him, he always at some point tries to bring up a point or bring up an opportunity to help me.”
The class is not centered solely on sports knowledge; rather, through the use of industry voices and a discussion format, Fellenzer encourages his students to engage in current conversations among classmates and network with possible employers.
A multi-billion dollar industry, sports media and business is one of the longest standing and most saturated fields to enter — every kid who has tuned into a game has dreamt of being either a player on the field or a broadcaster in the press box.
In his course, Fellenzer directly addresses the biggest obstacles of entering the industry. The class offers contacts, LinkedIn connections and a face for students to put to a person who just might put them in their career — something colleges market to attract young people to their campuses in the first place.
“How do you separate from the pack?” Fellenzer said. “Well, one way to do it is if you’re well-connected, because for me, it’s all about relationships. I think I have that in my keys to success … [You] can’t say necessarily it might be that way in accounting or medicine or something, but in sports, because so many people want to work in sports, there’s tremendous opportunities out there. The breadth of the industry has never been greater.”
Not only are his guests possibly beneficial to the students’ future careers, but the speakers themselves take away lessons from his class as well. Fellenzer has retained a network of individuals that return every year or even every semester. Ilan Ben-Hanan, senior vice president of programming and acquisitions at ESPN and a USC alum, is one of the class’s regulars.
“I actually end up learning so much by talking to each class and understanding how they consume their media, how they consume their sports, their perspectives on ESPN,” Ben-Hanan said. “It’s immensely valuable.”
Over the last 20 years, Fellenzer has acquired his own alumni network of students who have taken the class, including Memphis Grizzlies Vice President Zach Kleiman and three NFL quarterbacks — Sam Darnold, Matt Barkley and Cody Kessler — along with a multitude of editors, writers and content creators. 
“Sports, Business, Media” goes beyond checking off a credit requirement. Fellenzer has created a playbook for young people to follow into their careers.
“He’s created his own little team in here, and he’s their coach,” said Yogi Roth, a Pac-12 broadcaster and frequent guest speaker at Fellenzer’s class. “He brings in great assistants every once in a while to talk to them every week, but he’s still the head coach.” 
A USC alum himself, Roth understands the connection his host has with his students and what Fellenzer has contributed to the University.
“He’s a gem,” Roth said. “I think he’s the greatest gift on this campus, and I got no problem saying that.”
Fellenzer vows he will be at Annenberg on Wednesday nights for the foreseeable future. Just like at the ’76 Dodger game, he will continue to sit to the side, observing and moderating sports stars’ actions and commentary and ensuring that future generations understand the weight of their moment in history.
“I’m gonna enjoy discussing those things and passing on my knowledge and opinions as much as I would just learning about them and if I was just reading about them,” Fellenzer said. “It’ll seem fresh and relevant to me always, and I think that’s kind of a fun thing for me.”

Editor’s note: A previous version of this article stated that Ilan Ben-Hanan took Fellenzer’s course. Ben-Hanan attended USC, but did not take the course. The article has been updated online with the correct information. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
