USC Athletic Director Pat Haden insists the chapter has been closed.
Moving forward · Despite outrage from fans and alumni, USC athletic director Pat Haden believes the university must put the past behind it. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan
There won’t be a lawsuit. There won’t be any further action taken against the NCAA after it rejected the Trojans’ appeal of sanctions levied against the football program in June 2010, much to the chagrin of many alumni, boosters and fans.
“We’re not idiots,” Haden told the Daily Trojan on Friday. “The university has looked at every alternative. Period.”
Haden’s utterance of such words wasn’t the first in the months following the NCAA Committee on Infractions rejection of USC’s appeal in May, but unrest and disappointment among a variety of fans have persisted.
“It just feels like they’re kissing [the NCAA’s] butts a little bit and hoping it will all go away,” said Vic Orly, a 1994 USC graduate and six-year season ticket holder. “I think they really need to take a stance.”
The university, however, has ruled out the idea of a lawsuit.
“The university’s mission is best served by moving forward at this time, without pursuing further redress,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement Wednesday.  “We ask that the Trojan Family offer its utmost support to the student-athletes and coaches of the Trojan football team, confident that USC’s commitment to the highest level of excellence in academics and athletics will not waver in the coming years.”
Orly, along with Amy Lamare, a 1991 graduate who runs the website Gridiron Goddess, launched an online petition Saturday night, asking for the “cancelation of sanctions against USC.”
The petition, which went viral at approximately 6 p.m. Saturday, accumulated 1,248 signatures by noon Monday. Citing Paul Dee’s role as chairman of the Committee on Infractions during the USC hearing, the petition asks for the sanctions to be “dropped without delay whatsoever.”
“Hopefully they appeal the sanctions,” said Orly, who remains hopeful the petition can garner upward to 10,000 online signatures. “That’s the ultimate goal. Get rid of the bowl ban for this year, because this is unfair to our current players.”
The petition comes in the wake of a recent Yahoo! Sports report centering on a University of Miami booster Nevin Shapiro, who had been sentenced to federal prison for 20 years on June 7 for his involvement in a $930 million Ponzi scheme.
Shapiro supplied thousands of impermissible benefits to at least 72 Miami student-athletes, according to the report.
What has struck a chord among fans, however, is that Dee also served as the athletic director at Miami from 1993 to 2008.
“We were incensed, because he’s handing down infractions to USC that look like a parking ticket compared to what was happening at Miami at that exact time,” Lamare said. “He had it in for USC and I don’t think that’s just conjecture.”
The alleged violations, stemming from Shapiro’s involvement with the program, were said to have occurred from 2002 to 2010 — years primarily when Dee headed the school’s athletic programs.
“If the allegations prove true, the words irony and hypocrisy don’t seem to go far enough,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott told the Los Angeles Times last week.
Irritated with Dee’s involvement in the USC case, a number of fans have expressed disappointment with an inactivity from the university’s athletic department.
Because of a perceived conflict of interest with Dee placed on the COI, Orly and Lamare believe USC should either ask the NCAA to reopen the case or file a lawsuit altogether.
“It’s not that we didn’t do things wrong and act against the rules, but the punishment didn’t fit the crime,” Lamare said.
Even with more than 2,000 online signatures, Orly and Lamare — although acknowledging the near-impossible odds of NCAA President Mark Emmert listening to an assembly of bitter USC alumni, fans and students — hope, at least, to raise awareness of USC’s ill-treatment from the infractions committee, namely Dee.
“One thing that infuriates me is that, outside of the Pac-12, nobody really knows what happened with USC,” Lamare said. “They think this was a pay-for-play scandal. They really forget it was one player and one agent trying to lure him away. That has nothing to do with a competitive advantage.”
In Yahoo! Sports’ report, among the 72 Miami players identified as having received extra benefits, several had received them from Shapiro while being recruited out of high school, gaining access to cars, VIP clubs and his personal yacht.
Because Dee oversaw the Hurricanes’ program during this time period, Lamare and Orly argue that Dee’s assertion that USC “should have known” should apply to his run at Miami as well.
“Our case just came at the wrong time,” Lamare said. “We had this high-flying program for a number of years that people were jealous of. We laughed at Mike Garrett when he said that, but it’s kind of true.”
 
This latest statement by USC President Nikias is the epitome of this current administration. With the fallout from the University of Miami scandal, media and journalists across the country have come to the defense of USC by pointing out the hypocrisy of the NCAA and in particular, Mr. Paul Dee, who served as the Chairman of the Committee on Infractions that oversaw the USC case. Even if President Nikias feels it is best for the University to move forward, why come out with a public statement now, right when the media is coming to the defense of the University? ESPN has already picked up this latest statement from President Nikias and posted it on ESPN Los Angeles. Again, why post this statement right now and ruin any momentum the University had? Instead of continually sucking up to the NCAA, why not stand up for the University of Southern California? Where is the “Fight On” in this administration? What would hurt by publicly asking the NCAA for a full investigation into Mr. Paul Dee? While Mr. Dee is telling USC that he is “troubled” by the atmosphere at USC, he has a rouge booster: lead the University of Miami football team out of the tunnel, physically attack his Director of Compliance and even talk of putting a stripper pole in his luxury box, not to mention a host of other issues. President Nikias, have you taken the time to read what Long Beach State President, Mr. F. King Alexander, recently said about the NCAA and Mr. Paul Dee? Judging by his public comments, sounds like the Long Beach State President is doing more for USC’s case than you or Mr. Pat Haden ever dreamed of doing. If you and Mr. Haden do not want to defend the core integrity of the University of Southern California, please get out of the way and let someone else qualified do the job.
Does not matter if punishment did not fit the crime. It does not take away the fact that one of the players broke the rules. Stop crying, you got caught, and now you don’t like it. At least Haden is smart enough to see that the program has to move forward. One guilty all guilty, if that was not the case, Carroll would still be the coach. Reggie Bush does not care he is getting paid. If he did care, he would donate some big bucks for his screw up. You ONE PLAYER, was teh best player on your team. Accept the punishment, and stop crying.
Folks, you can view and sign the petition at uscpetition.org

The popularity and influence of soccer worldwide have finally garnered attention in the United States.
In fact, the USA women’s soccer team’s recent run to the World Cup Finals against Japan was the second-highest rated women’s soccer match on U.S. television.
With the recent success the USC women’s soccer team has had over the last four years, which includes its first NCAA title in 2007 and four straight appearances in the NCAA tournament since coach Ali Khosroshahin came to USC, it’s had more success than the football program in the past couple years.
No one at USC is saying soccer has replaced football.
In fact, it’s “fútbol” that has replaced “soccer.”
That’s not a misspelling.
The USC women’s soccer team has re-dubbed itself “USC fútbol,” as just one of countless marketing ideas the USC athletic department has implemented to increase interest in the program, which averaged just 369 fans per game at McAlister Field last season.
The idea is the brainchild of USC coach Ali Khosroshahin, who for years has run a “’SC Fútbol Academy” summer camp program.
“[Fútbol] is the word used to describe the sport in the majority of the world,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s really a name recognition thing more than anything else.”
The idea has garnered tremendous support from everyone in the athletic department.
Khosroshahin said he first took the idea to Senior Associate Athletic Director Steve Lopes. Together they took the idea to marketing, and from there to Athletic Director Pat Haden, all of whom Khosroshahin said were “fired up” about it.
“With our location here in Los Angeles, it’s vital to try to find a way to fit into this community,” Associate Athletic Director of Marketing Craig Kelley said. “Some of the people here feel somewhat disconnected from us, and this is a sort of way to bring them in.”
Khosroshahin also said he hopes the name change will help the community around USC relate to the sport.
“We have an international community here,” Khosroshahin said. “So we thought, ‘This is the world’s sport, let’s put the international moniker on it as well and see if we can get our international alumni and students to come out.’”
Nearly 1,500 fans turned out to watch USC take on Stanford at the Coliseum last season, and the program later broke the NCAA attendance record for a regular season women’s soccer matchup with a turnout of 8,527 at the Coliseum against UCLA. Otherwise, the highest attendance of the season was 603.
“I’d like to hope that with the logo and referring to ourselves as ‘fútbol’ that we can pull that international interest that we have on campus,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s something you can get into. We want to get people to come out, and if they come out and see us once, it might intrigue them enough to come back.”
This sentiment also was echoed by the marketing department.
“Our premise from a marketing strategy is to really hone in on four or five events a year,” Kelley said. “To really focus on getting people out to those games. If the fans come out and enjoy themselves, they’re going to come back.”
To draw to those select events, the marketing department has also started a “Food Truck Friday” tradition. Every Friday home game will feature two specialty food trucks at McAlister Field.
“There are eight, nine food trucks around campus on any given day because the students like them so much,” Kelley said. “The soccer field is so close to The Row and University Avenue and those dorms right there. It’s an opportunity for us to try and fill McAlister to capacity.”
Last Friday — opening day for the Women of Troy — featured a taco truck and an ice cream truck. The next Food Truck Friday is scheduled for Sept. 9, when the Women of Troy take on Oklahoma State in the Trojan Invitational Tournament.
Great marketing idea! Ali Khosroshahin is not only great soccer, er, “fútbol” coach, he’s a marketing genius.

It’s late August on USC’s University Park campus. Must mean it’s time to get psyched up for Trojan excellence in the 2012 Summer Olympics, right?
That’s what the athletic department would have you think.
The east side of Heritage Hall was recently adorned with a smattering of banners celebrating the amazing feats of USC athletes in past Olympics and promoting their participation in London next year. This all raises tempting questions.
Where’s football? Where’s the visor? Where’s the Trojans’ Heisman Trophy candidate Matt Barkley?
The USC football team is just nine days away from its first game of the 2011 season, and based on the recent display, the athletic department appears to find it more prudent to devote the space to a competition taking place next year. It’s a dominant hint that the prestige of the program has taken a palpable hit.
It’s not to say that Trojan performance in the Olympics hasn’t been spectacular — it truly has. Since 1904, 393 USC athletes have won 122 gold medals, 76 silver medals and 60 bronze medals, the school announced Monday.
But historically, this is the time when the university tends to live and breathe pigskin. It’s August, and fans, students and alumni are supposed to be thinking about track and field? Suddenly, it would seem as if Barkley’s potential final season, the tailback position battle and the wealth of talented wide receivers don’t matter so much anymore.
After four losses in 2009, Pete Carroll’s departure, June 2010’s sanctions and five losses in 2010, the boon of notoriety for Trojan football is on the downswing, and the athletic department is fruitlessly trying to fill the void with uplifting distractions. If football is the meatloaf, the Olympics are the knockoff cornflakes USC is trying to fill it with. And I’m not full.
The signs of declining interest continue to penetrate. Starting last semester, the athletic department has inundated students with countless notices about signing up for season tickets, a process that historically required no sales pitch. In 2008, they sold out within weeks. In 2006, they had to add additional seating to the student section. It’s not often the football program becomes an annoyance to students, but these repeated cries for ticket purchases represented nothing more than the groveling of incredibly wealthy paupers.
Recently, it was announced in email that, for the first time, students will have the option to purchase two $30 guest passes for every home game (except UCLA) and have those guests join them in the student section. The exclusivity of the student section was a great quality of the historic Coliseum. Now some student from Palo Alto, Calif., can sneak his Stanford tree-hugging friends into the front row if they get there early enough.
But it’s not enough to say the trend is only a manifestation of the athletic department’s selling out. Even if it makes sense to deny football advertising space, there are still plenty of other teams clamoring for attendance that might be interested in that kind of promotion. Just take a second and look at the gate figures for USC basketball games last year. Or the general ignorance of the perennially superb water polo team, which has won three straight NCAA titles.
The Olympics are an event that cannot be ignored, with incomparable international attention and coverage. USC’s presence will be better known in the Olympics without the slightest bit of promotion than the majority of varsity sports.
The hanging of these banners is a sleight of hand to get the USC community to think happy thoughts, but the focus right now should not be on effectively burying the football program to get people to stop thinking about all its problems. Instead, the efforts should be driving a discussion about why the football team is still great even without the possibility, let alone promise, of a bowl game appearance.
There is something to be said for the renovations to the Coliseum, how associate head coach and architect of the famed Tampa-2 Monte Kiffin is going to get this year’s team to buy in to his defensive strategies after a nightmarish 2010 performance. Why should fans avert their eyes when everything doesn’t go exactly how it’s supposed to go? It’s almost as if USC wants to emphasize a sort of fair-weather fanaticism — just as long as they keep selling tickets, tickets and more tickets.
There was a time a shade more than a decade ago when football was in a similarly bad place. USC tried to keep people interested.
What happened after that?

Amir Carlisle isn’t an ordinary freshman.
Through nearly three full weeks of fall camp, the first-year tailback from Sunnyvale, Calif., has continued to impress coaches and teammates alike, namely USC coach Lane Kiffin, who has likened him to a pair of successful freshmen from last season.
“[His] maturity, preparation for the game are very similar to the two guys that had the great freshman years in [wide receiver] Robert Woods and [cornerback] Nickell Robey,” Kiffin said. “It’s so rare for a true freshman to make an impact regardless of how physically talented they are unless they are mentally prepared and driven and focused, because there are so many distractions as a freshman.”
Standout · Though just a freshman, running back Amir Carlisle has shown in fall camp he is capable of starting the season opener. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Following senior tailback Marc Tyler’s suspension in late July, the Trojans have been without a proven tailback to start the year. Of the team’s four running backs competing to start the Sept. 3 season opener against Minnesota, only sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter appeared in a game for the Trojans in 2010.
Carlisle, as a result, remains fortunate to be in such a position.
“I just bring energy to it and determination,” Carlisle said. “The other backs are great backs. I’m just going to go out there and give it my all each and every play and leave the rest up to the coaches.”
With the opener little more than a week away, Kiffin confirmed that the race to replace Tyler had not been settled.
“No, we still haven’t figured it out,” Kiffin said of the competition.
Carlisle routinely broke through the line for big plays during snaps against the second team defense, and despite his small stature — 5-foot-10, 180 pounds — Carlisle believes his determination compensates for what he lacks in size.
“You know I’m a competitor,” Carlisle said. “I’m going to go out there and give it my all each and every play. I really pride myself on toughness.”
Yet Carlisle also admitted he still has plenty to learn.
“I try to learn the playbook as best I can. I’m new to it,” Carlisle said. “I have made mistakes, but I make it a point to get extra time in the playbook, really try to learn it.
For the first time this camp, Tyler made an appearance in pads at Wednesday’s practice, largely playing with the scout team, but Kiffin downplayed the event.
“It’s the next step in the process of [Tyler] hopefully coming back,” Kiffin said. “This isn’t a major step; he’s not cleared for the second game. It’s just something that we had in place as he goes through this process.”
Though the Trojans gained one player in Tyler on Wednesday, they lost others.
Kiffin announced that freshman fullback Charles Burks was injured earlier this week and will require knee surgery, forcing him to miss the entire season. Other injuries, however, were not as serious.
Junior guard Abe Markowitz left practice with a foot injury and was replaced by freshman Marcus Martin.
“Marcus has a great future here,” Kiffin said. “I think he’s a very talented athlete who really loves football.”
The team’s oldest eligible tailback, Curtis McNeal also sat out during Wednesday’s practice, complicating some of the team’s position battles.
During special teams drills, the punt return squad appeared confident in a variety of drills early, often pressuring freshman punter Kyle Albarado.
In the field goal and extra point drills, junior safety T.J. McDonald also blocked two attempts, while the kicking team converted the rest.

Any lasting ties between USC coach Lane Kiffin and the University of Tennessee are now gone.
Off the hook · USC coach Lane Kiffin was cleared of committing any major violations, which included impermissible recruiting activities and a failure to monitor, while serving as Tennessee’s coach in 2009. The investigation took less than six months. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The NCAA has notified USC that coach Lane Kiffin did not commit any major violations during his 14-month stint as coach at the University of Tennessee, the school announced Wednesday.
Kiffin had previously received a notice of allegations from the NCAA on Feb. 23, which included a failure to promote an atmosphere for compliance, a failure to monitor and impermissible recruiting activities — the former two being major infractions.
“I’m very grateful to the NCAA, the Committee on Infractions and its chairman Dennis Thomas for a very fair and thorough process,” Kiffin said in a statement. “I’m also very grateful that we were able to accurately and fairly present the facts in our case and that no action was taken against us. I’m pleased that the NCAA based its decision on the facts and not on perception.”
Thomas, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference commissioner, chaired the committee and ultimately found the evidence was “insufficient” to support any of the findings.
Though he was not disciplined following the two-year investigation, the COI did find the Tennessee football program, under Kiffin, had committed 12 secondary violations in 10 months, all of which pertained to recruiting.
“The committee was troubled by the number and nature of the secondary infractions by the football coaching staff during its one-year tenure at the institution,” the report said.
Kiffin, who served as coach of the Volunteers from November 2008 to January 2010, was nonetheless admonished by the committee.
“Some of the violations received nationwide publicity and brought the football program into public controversy,” the report read. “This is not a record of which to be proud.”
Former Tennessee men’s basketball coach, who was also cited by the NCAA, did, however, receive a three-year show-cause penalty, prohibiting him from recruiting for three years and forcing schools to “show cause” if they wish to hire him.
Kiffin and USC Athletic Director Pat Haden appeared at an NCAA hearing for the case in Indianapolis on June 11, sitting before the infractions committee for more than four hours.
“We obviously were pleased to learn about the NCAA’s ruling today regarding Lane Kiffin,” Haden said in a statement. “I appeared at Lane’s NCAA hearing, and I believe the NCAA’s decision is fair and based on the facts presented.”
The initial charges stemmed from impermissible telephone contact Kiffin and his staff made in 2010 with five recruits between Jan. 3 and Jan. 9 — a total of 16 calls spanning 47 minutes, according to a 26-page document released by Tennessee in late February.
Kiffin also allowed a recruiting intern, Steve Rubio, to accompany him on a recruiting trip to St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., despite forewarning from the school’s department of football operations.
On that trip, Rubio allegedly made “in-person, off-campus contact with high school administrators,” violating NCAA rules as an intern and a non-authorized off-campus recruiter.
“I’m also very grateful that the Tennessee football program was cleared of any wrongdoing,” Kiffin said.
Kiffin is not expected to be subject to any further discipline.
“I’m glad this is behind us now and I know Lane feels the same way,” Haden said. “From the time he arrived at USC, Lane Kiffin has been extremely compliant regarding NCAA rules and I feel confident that he will continue to be so.”
Kiffin expressed similar sentiments.
“As I have said before, we always have been committed to following NCAA rules and bylaws both at Tennessee and now at USC, and we always will be,” Kiffin said. “Now that this has reached its conclusion, I am looking forward to continuing to prepare our team for the upcoming season.”
USC, which finished 8-5 in Kiffin’s first season at the school, begins its season on Sept. 3 against Minnesota.

School is back in session, but who says you can’t still enjoy late-night adventures to the movie theater with some friends? Better yet, how about free movies? Before they officially hit any theaters? Conveniently located on campus?
I know, sounds too good to be true. But, thanks to the USC School of Cinematic Arts, it’s a crazy dream-turned-reality for students who love movies but can’t even scrape together the change for the theater in the University Village. Every semester, the School of Cinematic Arts has a program cleverly titled “Outside the Box [Office]” that presents advanced screenings of international and independent films on a weekly basis here on campus.
Don’t come expecting to see big names like Twilight or Harry Potter. The films shown might not necessarily be distributed as widely as their box office-smashing buddies, so this is a great opportunity to see films you might not have access to otherwise.
Outside the Box aims to highlight films and documentaries from around the globe, so it’s a big hoorah for diversity. Past international film screenings include the quirky Official Selection for the 2010 Cannes International Film Festival, Rubber (France) and the chilling Academy Award-nominated film for Best Foreign Language Film, Dogtooth (Greece).
If those don’t quite whet your appetite, there are plenty of American films with familiar faces. Fan of Dwight Schrute? Rainn Wilson has appeared in Outside the Box’s presentation of Super alongside Ellen Page and Kevin Bacon. Did Joseph Gordon-Levitt make your heart throb in (500) Days of Summer? You just missed him rocking out with Natalie Portman in Hesher last spring.
Don’t miss out on any other great (and, did I mention, free?) movies! Though some are open to the public, others are presented exclusively for students with a USC ID and a timely RSVP. How can you say ‘no’ to that? Click on over to this handy dandy link for more information on how to get on the mailing list and a full list of screenings for the fall 2011 semester: https://cinema.usc.edu/events/event.cfm?id=11981. See you at the movies!

Everyone’s heard of the term “artsy fartsy.” It succinctly and humorously sums up the idea that art is only for an elite group, a cluster of people who discuss abstract painting with a cocktail in hand. These days, however, it rings less and less true as a new union between art and everyday life emerges.
Last summer the line for the last days of MOCA Geffen Contemporary’s “Art in the Streets” wound around the streets of Little Tokyo. Tim Burton’s current exhibition at LACMA is busy almost everyday.
But museums aren’t the only ones creating the news. When the I-405 shut down, an individual dared to plank on it, transforming the trend — started by people like the Taiwanese female duo Karren and Jinyu, who lie face down in specific locations and take photographs — into a form of artistic expression. And just recently, a stolen Rembrandt sketch called “The Judgment” was found in a church after having been taken from a Ritz Carlton hotel in Marina del Rey.
The art world today is creating waves that affect a huge group of people, not just art fanatics. Visual art, and by extension any type of art, cannot truly thrive without the interest of a wide range of people. And it’s booming thanks to the accessibility of seeing and making art. It’s not just for people who have memorized hundreds of complex art terms; it’s for anyone with an eye for boldness and complexity.
The world itself has become a canvas.
“Art in the Streets” congregated the very artists who initially rebelled against the galleries, attempting to break beyond its confinements to create a more universal art. The widespread interest in Shepard Fairey, Banksy and many more blossomed not in a fancy-schmancy gallery party but as everyday people were on their way to work or school. You didn’t pay admission to see “OBEY” stickers on electricity poles or to see Swoon’s cutouts on dirty, concrete walls.
That a crowd, with everything from a veritable art history scholar to a skateboarding pre-teen, now stands together in line for an exhibition shows art museums are gaining new interest and breaking through the stuffy stereotype they’ve been caught in.
Galleries are also pushing past these preconceptions, as indicated by the booming number of attendees at the monthly L.A. Art Walk. Many people roam the streets into the late hours of the night, walking into galleries they normally wouldn’t have visited when the sun was up.
And when it comes to making art, the criteria for what defines art is getting harder and harder to agree on. Though frustrating to some, this actually makes art all the more universal.
Planking, for example, can be seen as more of a physical activity, but the photographs taken are sometimes stunning in their set-up and shock factor. And for the people walking nearby, the plankers — face down on the floor — are continuing the tradition of performance art started many decades ago.
With each new step into a novel definition of art, the space for disagreement and controversy grows. Once artists put their pieces where the public can see them, they are exposing themselves to hundreds of thousands of opinions, backgrounds and aesthetic tastes.
That’s what makes this an exciting time for art. Artists can push limits not only in terms of media, but also in how they distribute their art. Our generation is willing to check out a stranger’s Tumblr or WordPress, and anyone who reads the newspaper will likely come across an art-related piece.
This puts art in the public consciousness more than ever. The average student can google an artist’s name, attend art-related events on campus and witness students creating their own pieces on top of the Roski School of Fine Arts library.
This is the perfect time to discover and create new art, and finding a new artist or the right inspiration just means keeping your eyes and ears open — no entrance fee required.

You’ve never met anyone like your new date. There’s the rapid beating of your heart and that fluttering in your stomach. Maybe you’ve just found yourself thrust into a blind date by a stubborn, matchmaking roommate and all you want is for the night to go as  smoothly as possible. Or perhaps you are looking to celebrate your six-month anniversary with the person you think might be the absolute love of your life.
Charbroil classic · Restaurants like Lucille’s Smokehouse Bar-B-Que give couples the perfect combination of privacy and fine dining. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Whatever your motivation for driving into town and getting cozy with a love interest, Los Angeles is replete with restaurants that are romantic, exciting and flavorful. Take advantage of spots like these to make that first, second or 10th date one to remember.
Mas Malo 
Opened in January, Mas Malo is relatively new to the Los Angeles culinary world. What this means for you is the ability to win your date over with your knowledge of this trendy, delicious newbie. The Mexican food dished up is authentically spicy and allows you to be adventurous. In the evenings, the large number of diners might make it a bit noisy, but the small tables allow you to be intimate. The high-ceiling interior was actually the location of a jewelry store back in 1923, a snippet of history you can bring out when the conversation becomes dull. With everything from vegan menudo to lobster diablo and an assortment of cocktails and wine, Mas Malo is sure to impress.
Mas Malo is located on 515 West Seventh St.
 
Siamese Garden
Walking into Siamese Garden is a little like entering a different world. Amid the bustling city sounds of Marina del Rey and the onslaught of traffic caused by  nearby Venice Beach, there is this quaint Thai restaurant complete with a nearby canal. Going into Siamese Garden requires a splendidly romantic walk along a little pathway lined with plants and strung lights. The inside dining area is intimate, with small candles at each table and the Thai food is top-notch. Woo your date with some steaming Pad Thai, hot sake and a deliciously sweet mango and sticky rice dessert.
Siamese Garden is located on 301 Washington Blvd. in Marina Del Rey.
 
Cucina Rustica 
If it’s past the first few dates and you’re looking to set a more serious note, Cucina Rustica is the ideal place to show your love interest your true sincerity. As its name suggests, the interior of this fancy restaurant is rustic yet modern and creative. The dimly lit location is ideal for some low-key conversation, but if you want more noise, there is a bar downstairs with TVs and live jazz  Thursdays. Spoil your boo with succulent dishes like penne carciofi e spinaci, artichoke hearts with penne pasta and a delicious white wine and marinara sauce, and a gelato truffle or sorbet. With great service and wines from countries like Italy and Argentina, Cucina Rustica will have your date swooning by evening’s end.
Cucina Rustica is located on 888 Wilshire Blvd.
 
Lucille’s Smokehouse 
If you think romance is overrated and you’d rather go somewhere more fun, Lucille’s Smokehouse might satisfy your needs. This restaurant has its own smoker for some authentic barbecue grubbing and you could even sip your drink from a jar. Order the appetizer platter to start the meal off right with everything from fried okra to fried dill pickles. At the end of the meal, your waiter will bring you warm hand towels to wipe your hands so you can comfortably clasp your beau’s hand on the way out. Whether you’re a huge fan of barbecue or not, Lucille’s is an intriguing experience for all involved.
 
Lucille’s Smokehouse is located on 6000 Sepulveda Blvd. in Culver City.

After an uncharacteristically drab Southern California summer concert season, lacking high-profile performances and exciting new acts, things appear to be shaping up for music lovers across Los Angeles in the upcoming months.
Fun for all · One of the musical highlights this summer includes FYF Fest, taking place at Historic Park, a festival notorious for its jam-packed lineups of talented indie artists, such as Panda Bear and the Growlers. - Photo courtesy of MOTORMOUTHMEDIA
Keeping with the city’s reputation as an independent music mecca, concert-savvy Angelenos have an impressive roster of shows to choose from beginning this fall as household names and underground superstars schedule stops across the Southland.
But with so many notable fall shows — many on the same night — what’s a music fan to do?
To facilitate the task of deciding which concerts are worth your hard-earned cash, here are several must-see performances that should be on your radar.
FYF Fest — Sept. 3, Los Angeles State Historic Park
After last year’s numerous logistical snafus — vendors running out of water, food lines moving at a laborious pace and attendees missing bands while waiting hours to enter the venue — FYF’s organizers promise all problems have been addressed for the festival’s 2011 incarnation. Although ticket prices are notably higher than in years past, the significantly more adventurous and unique additions to this fall’s FYF Fest lineup justify the extra cash.
Ravers and devoted followers of Pitchfork might close out the evening dancing side by side during a live set from power duo Simian Mobile Disco while punk rockers,  young and old, will undoubtedly start a ferocious mosh pit watching former Black Flag and Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris lead his new band OFF!
Other notable bands on the lineup include several celebrated local acts (Tijuana Panthers, No Age and Fool’s Gold), indie-rock royalty (Guided By Voices and Broken Social Scene) and a handful of completely unexpected yet pleasant surprises (Olivia Tremor Control and Dead Milkmen).
Despite the wide variety of music featured in Saturday’s festivities, one act is sure to stand out above the rest — a rare appearance from Hermosa Beach nerd punk legends Descendents.
Iggy and the Stooges — Sept. 7, Hollywood Palladium 
At 64 years young, Iggy Pop shows no signs of slowing down. The Stooges’ front man is known for regularly delivering electrifying and shirtless performances wrought with bizarre onstage antics.
Often associated with the “birth” of American punk, Iggy and the Stooges’ gritty, thunderous brand of Detroit rock appeals to music lovers of all types: Famous fans of the band range from David Bowie to Madonna.
The Stooges fill their performances with some of the band’s most celebrated songs, including “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” “Raw Power” and “Search and Destroy,” ensuring longtime fans will not walk away disappointed.
Everyone else? Pick up a copy of the band’s legendary 1973 album Raw Power and get listening.
Peter Hook performs the albums of Joy Division
Repeating the success of his highly acclaimed “Unknown Pleasures” tour last winter, former Joy Division bassist Peter Hook returns to Los Angeles for an encore performance of his rendition of the seminal U.K. post-punk band’s first album. Hook will be performing Closer, Joy Division’s second and final LP, at the Music Box on Sept. 14, and Unknown Pleasures at El Rey Theatre on Sept. 16.
As Joy Division never toured the United States — enigmatic lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide on the eve of the group’s American tour in 1980 at the age of 23 — Hook’s interpretations of these two influential albums is as close as fans will get to seeing the group perform its works live.
TV on the Radio, Arctic Monkeys, Panda Bear, Warpaint, Smith Westerns — Sept. 25, Hollywood Bowl
Combining an eclectic and unexpected lineup of vastly different artists, including the internationally renowned TV on the Radio, the notoriously reclusive Panda Bear and the still partially-underground Smith Westerns, this Hollywood Bowl evening reads like a who’s-who of the past decade in independent music.
Though the lineup might seem schizophrenic at first glance, all five artists’ musical catalogues combine laid-back, introspective tunes with lively, danceable numbers; with this common theme, the show just might be something that works.
Bring a picnic basket (and some wine) and prepare yourself for an, entertaining evening filled with some of the best bands independent music has to offer.

Throwback Film —Halloween — Aug.26
The Egyptian Theater is screening a triple threat of all three Halloween films. It’s still August, but it’s never too early to get into the spirit of Halloween. Watch as John Carpenter’s ’70s and ’80s classics light up the screen with horror as the homicidal mental hospital patient, Michael Meyers, pursues the quick and witty Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in a race to the death. Instead of opting for Guillermo del Torro’s eerie Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark, revisit the past with cheesy ’80s gore and scare tactics. There’s nothing like an old, scary movie night.
Quirky Goodies — Fonuts
A new bakery-pastry-coffee shop opened yesterday in mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles. Boasting unorthodox donuts, Fonuts serves LAMILL coffee and yeast and cake-based donuts.
The intriguing aspect of Fonuts, aside from the name, is that its donuts are baked rather than fried, producing a scrumptious effect that strays from the traditional practice of donut baking. Fonuts doesn’t stop there. Its menu is riddled with an assortment of more-than-eccentric flavors ranging from Banana Chocolate and Peach to Chorizo Cheddar and Rum.
Started by up-and-coming baker and pastry chef, Waylynn Lucas, Fonuts promises to change the way you experience donuts with their reinvented baking methods and flavors — plus vegan and wheat/gluten free options.
End of Summer Festival — Fiesta La Ballona — Aug. 26 to Aug. 28
Fiesta La Ballona, Culver City’s pride and joy of the summer and a standing tradition since 1951, will be put on this weekend at Veteran’s Park, just off of Culver Boulevard and Overland Avenue. The festival indulges in everything a carnival should be. There are corn dogs and cotton candy aplenty, an eclectic music selection ranging from jazz to Latin, eccentric vendors with a wide collection of jewelry, plenty of arcade games to add another cheesy stuffed animal to your collection and, of course, the rides. Be sure to hop on the dragon boat, the quintessential carnival ride. Get this last taste of summer while you can.
MTV 2011 Video Music Awards — Aug. 28 9 p.m.
Ready for another dose of VMAs? This year’s concoction of artists, surprises, performances and awards looks sure to be an exciting-yet-extravagant event.
Scheduled to perform are Beyoncé, Pitbull and Jessie J, Adele, Bruno Mars, Chris Brown, Lady Gaga, Lil Wayne and Young the Giant. With such a wide array of acts all on the same stage, this year’s lineup will undoubtedly go down in VMA history.
Get ready to see all of your favorite artists as they present, perform and compete against other nominees in front of a dazzling crowd of Hollywood stars and fortunate attendees. Also, the polls are still open for best new artist (Tyler, the Creator; Big Sean; Foster the People; Kreayshawn; or Wiz Khalifa), so don’t forget to vote online.

Star Wars is quite possibly the most iconic series of our time. That being said, there have been hundreds of spoofs, parodies and artistic interpretations of George Lucas’ legendary work. One might think there isn’t much room for artistic growth — that this intergalactic theme has run its course — but “Art From a Galaxy Far Far Away” proves otherwise.
The force · Artists Randy Martinez and Denise Vasquez spin popular and cultural themes on Star Wars-oriented art, such as Dia de Los Muertos, the Beatles, pop art, comic culture and sculptures. - Photo courtesy of Gorgeous PR
The vivacious energy was immediately felt at the Saturday opening of this contemporary exhibit put on by Hold Up Art, a small and intimate gallery in Downtown Los Angeles.
Storm troopers and Darth Vader, with his light saber in tow, lined the entrance, allotting photo ops for enthused art connoisseurs and fans of the film alike. The enthusiasm of the motley crowd, featuring young Jedi knights, trendy college students and middle-aged couples, could not be contained.
The Star Wars franchise is evidently still alive and well.
The exhibit featured the pop art style of Randy Martinez and Dia de Los Muertos-inspired work of Denise Vasquez, both of which served as an interesting and modern take on a tried-and-true theme.
Martinez opted for bright colors and an outlandish style, which borders on, but doesn’t cross, the thin line between bold and cartoonish. A few of his pieces featured different versions of the main subject: a black-and-white sketch, a small portrait and a large portrait.
For instance, one of these triple threats showcased a menacing Annakin Skywalker, weaponry and badass attitude in hand, in the foreground with a bright, eye-catching background. His red light saber flashes in all directions, redirecting your line of vision and offering a new perspective. These different takes on the same image change your perspective on the subject as a whole and reel you into the artistic process as the piece breaks the fourth wall.
Additionally, Martinez brought a dynamic air of three-dimensionality to his two-dimensional pieces by placing individual lead characters like Han Solo in front of a series of Star Wars themed comics, keeping the focus on these compelling protagonists.
Similarly, another bright, eccentric piece featuring Darth Vader, Yoda and company showcases a group of Lucas’ brilliant creations spinning upside down on a roller coaster, immediately grabbing the viewer’s attention.
Though these pieces catch the eye of the audience, one piece in particular stood out — The Beatles’ Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band cover, Star Wars edition. The piece stands apart as an ultimate pastiche of the six films and as a prime example of postmodernism; it includes Lucas among a ragtag assortment of Star Wars characters. Martinez is a true artist in the sense that he can manipulate such an iconic album cover and film series, bringing a new and interesting light to the heart of pop culture.
Vasquez also enlightens viewers with something that has never been seen before — Star Wars meets Day of the Dead. She took a childhood favorite and blended it with her Latina culture to create the quintessential representation of her being.
Vasquez found the inspiration to incorporate two seemingly unrelated themes from something deep within, claiming “I felt as though something was reminding me to reconnect with my culture, my influences, what I was missing … Wanting to incorporate my loves and where I was at the moment, the idea came to me, Star Wars meets Dia De los Muertos and I knew that was it,” Vasquez said — perhaps you could say she used the force.
Other pieces included a miniature, doll-like Princess Leia with a skeleton body and her iconic hair buns made of yarn, catching both the essence of the Latino tradition and film itself. A sith lord, Yoda and Han Solo effectively do the same, as well.
As for the best in show, an intricately designed Darth Vader helmet takes the prize. A white base, versus the traditional black, gives the piece the celebratory feeling of Day of the Dead. The sinuous and detailed red and black design administers a true sense of artistry. Plus, the innovative concept is enough to keep viewers gawking and the ingenuity running for days on end.
“Art From a Galaxy Far Far Away” brings a whole new level to what it means to be an innovative artist in our postmodern era. View this exhibit you must.
 
Art From a Galaxy Far Far Away runs through September 15th and is located at 358 East Second St. 
Fantastic Article! Thank you for coming to our opening & for writing this FANTASTIC article!

Weren’t gas prices supposed to go down?
Looking at the short term, one could say they have — the average retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in California has declined from its mid-May peak of $4.26. The aggregate trajectory of state gas prices from last year at exactly this time, however, shows an unmistakable, very significant increase in prices.
One year ago today, a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline cost $3.08 on average, but today that average hovers at $3.74. Around campus, the lowest price you’ll find is $3.53 a gallon at a gas station called “C&J.”
The only time gas prices in California have reached this level for any sustained period of time were in the heady days that preceded the bursting of the housing bubble in 2008.
Even with market volatility in the past few weeks and several mixed reports on the country’s economic vital signs, gas prices are not decreasing.
Growing demand is without a doubt fueling an increase in U.S. gas prices, but that demand is, troublingly, not coming from our own shores or our own economy.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
Global growth and subsequent demand for oil, namely from the big developing nations like China, India and Brazil, is only accelerating despite a sluggish U.S. economy and a debt-ridden Eurozone.
Concentrated foreign economic growth is inflating gas prices in the United States, and we had better get used to it.
As developing nations continue rapid growth, transitioning away from factories and straight production of goods into a more diversified economy, wages rise, workers’ wealth accumulates and the newly anointed middle class masses hit the road.
But the increased consumption of oil, and the subsequent rise in prices, won’t occur solely from an increase in miles driven worldwide.
Wait until that new middle class decides to move out of overcrowded cities into the suburbs, firing up a phalanx of backhoes, bulldozers and graders to ready the earth for a new surge of housing. Global growth simply requires increased consumption of gasoline, and the rising energy prices of the last quarter century stand witness to the fact.
In the coming years, everyone will be paying more for energy — of all types and across all nations — but gas prices will be particularly affected by global economic tides, especially here in the United States.
Given our extreme dependence on an abundance of cheap fuel, we are particularly susceptible to price rises, even more so here in Southern California.
This region is built for the car; without one, you can’t go all that far. As a handful of nations presses forward and global demand for oil rages, the United States — especially auto-centric cities like Los Angeles — will be among the first to feel a sustained pinch at the pump.  Trojan commuters have seen the fits and starts of this rise already, but the largest push is still to come.
This will make an already expensive school even more of a financial burden. It’s not a stretch to assume that enrollment from commuters will steadily decline as gas prices steadily rise.
Gas prices might not increase dramatically tomorrow, or next week or in the next few months, but the trend of the last three years is largely indicative of what lies ahead. The extent to which gas price escalation interrupts our normal economic patterns and daily activity, including how our economy will function when you can’t get to Vegas for $49 one way,  contingent upon our ability to identify substitutes for gasoline in the long term. Current oil prices and rapid — albeit concentrated — economic growth reinforce the same message: The days of cheap gas are long gone.
 
Teddy Minch is a graduate student studying public policy.
Gas prices are extremely high in Europe and it is my feeling that there is a movement out there to make the oil prices just as expensive as prices in Europe. Essentially you will have one world price of oil wherever you travel.

I would hazard a guess that quite a few USC students have bathed in the fluorescent glow of Leavey Library during the early hours of the morning the night before an important midterm or a project deadline.
But it was probably not to pore over forgotten tomes of literature, browse piles of yellow research papers or read a copy of Vogue magazine from the early 1900s — all courtesy of USC’s digital library.
In mid-July, USC added 33 new electronic resources to USC Libraries’ already extensive collection, which is easily accessible through USC Libraries’ E-Resources page. In July 2010, USC announced the purchase of 59 online resources, including subscriptions to several research databases.
Most students are, however, oblivious to the newest online resource additions. They also grossly underutilize the libraries resources — especially the very substantial number of e-resources and database subscriptions USC provides.
Students should take more advantage of the number of digital libraries that the university provides in order to have more success in their academics.
Often, students only frequent the libraries for a quiet place to study, to use a computer or to print. USC appears to be well aware of the evolution toward online resources and has continually updated its subscriptions to educational databases or purchased additional e-resources to encourage student research. Whether students use these resources, however, is another case.
Most students should make themselves aware that USC has 23 libraries, more than half of which are on the University Park Campus. Most USC students are completely inexperienced in using USC’s digital resources, more commonly relying on search engines for academic research, even when there is a wealth of resources at their fingertips through the USC Libraries.
From 2009 to 2010, USC had more than 900,000 e-books, e-journals and USC Libraries Digital Archive items, according to the Libraries. USC Libraries also processed approximately 20,000 electronic reference transactions, about 20 percent of the total reference transactions for the fiscal year.
Digital resource utilization might be underwhelming at the moment, probably because students are unaware of available resources, but USC has continued to expand its collections.
From personal experience, these articles and publications are often more in-depth, credible and thorough than those that can be found through a routine Google search.
The university must now make an attempt to further publicize the numerous online journals and databases so students can take advantage of these beneficial services that the university offers.
In their future career, students will have to research subjects related to their work more often than they might imagine. On the more professional levels, in fact, a basic search-engine query might not return any suitable results. Students should acquaint themselves with the databases USC subscribes to, most of which are common and highly regarded in the professional world.
Students should take full advantage of what USC has to offer and should familiarize themselves with USC Libraries’ online databases as well as their other resources USC Libraries might want to consider publicizing its collections more effectively so more students know about them. Perhaps then the next research paper or project might not require an overnight stay in Leavey.
 
Rebecca Gao is a sophomore majoring in global health and biological studies. 
Great article. As a science major, I need regular access to journal articles which would be prohibitively expensive to buy one by one. I have never encountered a situation where USC didn’t have access to the article, which is pretty amazing. You name it, they’ve got it. More people need to learn about it. 
Luckily, a couple of my courses have made a point of scheduling library classes. But I think USC orientations should include a required library education seminar. That way we’d ensure everyone would know about the resources at their disposal.
Hello, Rebecca.
I’m the executive director of communications and public programming at the USC Libraries, and we couldn’t agree more about the value of the authoritative research resources we provide, online and off. Thank you for this great call to action for our community.
We offer several ways for students to begin finding and using the libraries’ subscription resources:
Research guides by subject area: http://libguides.usc.edu/
A complete guide to electronic databases: http://www.usc.edu/libraries/databases/list_category.php
In-person and online research help: http://www.usc.edu/libraries/services/ask_a_librarian/
If anyone has questions or would like help finding or using any of the USC Libraries’ collections in print or online, we have many subject-specialists ready to help: http://www.usc.edu/libraries/about/directory/subject_librarian.php
Thanks once again for your excellent perspective on the importance of credible, scholarly resources to student research.
Rebecca,
     I am part of a team which maintains the various subscriptions, linking programs and on campus & off campus access authentication mechanisms.  There are literally hundreds of databases, thousands of full text books and journals available via the web to USC faculty, staff and students from anywhere in the world.  While these resources may be under utilized by students, our access statistics show that there were more than 1.5 million used in the previous fiscal year (I haven’t yet finished statistics for the fiscal just concluded).
     We have worked with faculty to enable them to integrate these materials into their courses (and into Blackboard), we have developed targeted subject specific “LibGuides” with specific links to related materials available at http://www.usc.edu/libraries and we do note about 3,000 logins to access these materials per day.
Rebecca, your article is right on. I’ve just recently retired after 40 years as a librarian. The last few libraries I worked in were rich in academic electronic resources. Yet the students seemed to ignore them in favor of Google and other search engines, and Wikipedia, which several instructors told their classes was not recognized as a valid source. Seems almost wasteful to subscribe to these services which students seem to ignore. Hopefully, things will change.  Great article!!

Are you still in touch with all your exes? How about your best friends from middle school? More likely than not, your answer is no.
But what if I asked you what they did last weekend?
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
You could probably just look them up on Facebook.
That’s what’s interesting about Facebook. It claims to connect us to people, places and things we love;  it also connects us to people, places and things we loved when we were 16.
Facebook is designed so fragments from your past reappear and remind you subtly and persistently that they exist.
The site’s ability to take our focus away from the present is part of what makes it such a notorious time-waster.
Though a little reminiscing never hurts, college students’ love-hate relationship with Facebook would have a little more love in it if Facebook didn’t enable us to keep digging up the past.
To become more useful — and more meaningful, for that matter — Facebook should help us connect to what we care about right now. We should also strive to use it more constructively. Instead of using it as a way to cultivate our public image by showing our friends how much fun we are having via tagged photos, we should use it in a meaningful way to keep in touch with one another.
Facebook etiquette dictates defriending someone is an indication of strong dislike; if you have just been through a breakup, defriending can even brand you as the bitter ex who needs to “get over it.”
Therefore, many post-relationship relationships persist beyond their expiration dates. People exchange wall posts and status comments with others despite of the fact that, if they were to hang out for more than half an hour, they would have almost nothing to say to each other.
All this can result in a longing for a vague form of the past that never existed in the first place. It is nostalgia strung together by a few photos and wall posts.
Facebook is a wonderful tool, but to keep these issues at bay, the company should modify some of its features.
Consider the News Feed. Facebook is very secretive about the algorithms that decide what shows up. To peek behind the scenes, Business Insider ran a controlled experiment.
The results are quite revealing: Though people you currently interact with show up often, so do people with higher friend counts and people whose profiles are viewed frequently. If the person you are dating right now has 100 friends and barely posts links, you might miss their status updates in favor of updates from people you never see in person.
Although variety is nice, Facebook should make the news feed represent people’s physical realities more closely. In addition to measuring a user’s interaction with another, the algorithms should also prioritize people from the user’s region or workplace. Reworking a system like this would encourage people to make connections in their own areas.
The features that show status updates from a year ago or photo albums from 2006 are quite different. These bits and pieces appear without providing context. Facebook as a whole induces uninvited nostalgia, distracting people from whatever they were doing before.
Admittedly, no amount of programming can make people use Facebook for their benefit, but that’s why we should take the time to think about what we do on the site.
Even if you can’t stop yourself from checking in on people you used to know well, it would be good not to take their profiles too seriously. People usually don’t represent their lives objectively.
If Facebook were life, we’d be living a sad and two-toned existence. It’s not the real deal.
 
Maya Itah is a senior majoring in communication. Her column “From Behind the Screen” runs Thursdays. 
You are quite right when you said “It’s not the real deal”
Facebook and other social networking sites are the masks of the internet.
Thanks, Maya. This is a good reminder that Facebook relationships don’t necessarily mimic real-life ones.
jeez… you forgot one of the simplest  to access features… you can also just sign off … life is what we make of it, and Facebook doesn’t MAKE me or you do anything…

The Los Angeles Board of Works voted 3-1 on Monday to deny operating permits to the Sunset Junction Street Festival, less than a week before it was scheduled to start.
The board attributed its decision to nearly $400,000 in unpaid fees dating back to last year from the festival’s organizers, which has taken place every year in the Silver Lake community since 1980.
The Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance tried to convince the panel it could pay back its debt, producing a fax that showed it had recently received a $100,000 loan from concert promoter Live Nation.
But the group ultimately failed to turn in a check for $141,000 to cover the fees for this year’s event, and still owe $260,000 to the city from last year’s festival.
The board decided it could not risk the possibility that the festival would not be able to repay either of those fees.
“This organization has failed this city time and time again,” said board president Andrea Alarcon to the Los Angeles Times. “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”
This year, the festival was supposed to feature sets from artists such as the Butthole Surfers, Art Brut and Hanson.
In years past, acts such as The Airborne Toxic Event, Silversun Pickups, Phantom Planet and The Black Keys have performed at the festival before hitting it big.
Now, it looks as though up-and-coming bands will have to find somewhere else to showcase their talent.

The University Village food court often appears to be a wasteland of mediocre ethnic food. Though there are more than 10 establishments occupying a vaulted room in USC’s resident strip mall, students have long lamented the greasy, overpriced food and run-down appearance.
I decided to put this reputation to the test and embark upon a tour of the UV food court, testing the best-sellers at each stand. So far, I’ve only ordered from five of the “restaurants,” but there have already been clear winners and clear losers.
Manas Indian Restaurant is often thought to be the only respectable Indian restaurant in the USC campus area, but the UV gives them a run for their reputation with Taste of India, a fast-order takeout establishment.
Don’t be intimidated by the cafeteria trays in the front; though the displays might all look similar, every item is drastically different. As odd as it might sound, the fact that the dishes have been sitting out in the warm metal trays means the spices and flavors have had time to meld together and create a more complex taste.
The chicken tikka masala was fair, with large chunks of chicken swimming in a fairly standard masala (a creamy, tomato-based sauce); when combined with a heavy-handed serving of basmati rice, the portion was hearty and delicious. The chana masala — chickpeas with a light garam masala sauce — had a spicy kick to it, thanks to both ginger and chiles.
Overall, the only problem with Taste of India was its naan, which was served as a lackluster side dish to the flavorful main courses. It was dry and tasteless. For around $12, I purchased a two-item meal (which came with sides of basmati rice, naan and a generic salad) and a large drink. The portion size ensures customers get their money’s worth.
For those who prefer Japanese food, the UV has one sushi and bento stand; initially, I was hestitant to try raw fish at a restaurant in the UV, but after trying the bento box at Manna Japanese, I realized a good meal at a Japanese restaurant didn’t have to include sushi.
The lunch special bento box cost less than $10 and came with an impressive amount of food: five pieces of crispy panko-breaded vegetable and shrimp tempura, three fried gyoza (potstickers), four pieces of California roll, a serving of teriyaki chicken, salad and a cup of miso soup.
The tempura was good until the end, when the last few pieces proved too soggy, but each piece was distinguishable as either vegetable or shrimp (an important consideration). The gyoza was delicious, as was the miso soup; however, the teriyaki chicken varied between well-cooked and overly tough.
A word of caution for teriyaki fanatics: Extra teriyaki sauce will cost you another 50 cents, but the sauce is so good it’s worth it.
I plan on continuing my tour of the University Village international food court, and so far have yet to be majorly disappointed. This hidden gem could do with an infusion of customers, so stop by the UV for a cheap meal of appreciable quality and diversity.
Sandwich Island, anyone?
That’s the best place to eat at USC. I went there for lunch today, delicious and I only spent $4.50!

Coach: Jeff Tedford
2010: 5-7 (3-6 in the Pac-10)
Returning starters: Seven (offense), six (defense)
California has fallen on tough times as of late, finishing with a 5-7 mark in 2010 — the first time in eight years that it had not made a bowl game. This season, the Golden Bears lose some of their main pieces on offense as well, namely quarterback Kevin Riley and running back Shane Vereen, who rushed for 1,225 yards last season. The offense was rather pedestrian in 2010, averaging 25.8 points per game — 73rd nationally.
Running the show at quarterback this year will be Buffalo transfer junior Zach Maynard, and replacing Vereen in the backfield will be junior Isi Sofele. One of the bright spots of the offense will be returning wide receiver Marvin Jones, a 6-foot-2 senior, who caught 50 passes for 765 yards and four touchdowns a season ago.
The defense, which ranked first in the conference in yards allowed per game, returns just five starters and remains a serious question mark as a result. But senior linebacker Mychal Kendricks, who was also all-conference last year, was named to the Butkus Award watch list, is back.

USC Student Affairs launched the new Transfer and Veteran Student Programs office this year in an effort to better serve the two populations on campus, university officials said.
“The biggest thing for the university is to become a transfer and veteran student-friendly campus,” said Syreeta Greene, assistant director of Transfer and Veteran Student Programs. “This is a really good start.”
The new office will serve as a resource hub for transfer and military veteran students and host a variety of events to help build the community and relationships among the students, Greene said.
“A big thing is — for any student — knowing what your niche is,” Greene said. “Right now, our focus is to create a community, to create a niche for these students.”
Student Affairs created one office for transfer and veteran students because the two populations often share similar experiences and challenges while adapting to a large university setting.
“Transfer and veteran students, many times, they’re older or they’ve been out of school for a while,” Greene said. “In the shuffle of life, they’re trying to succeed as first-time freshmen, but with other challenges.”
Such challenges can range from commuting to school to supporting a family, Greene said.
“Now, they know that there’s one person and one program that they can come to,” said Greene, who said her office on the third floor of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center is always open.
Veteran students who attended TVSP’s first event, the Veteran Student Welcome on Tuesday, said they are glad to have a number of readily available resources together in one place.
“I was really interested in disability services. This was a great opportunity to come meet them,” said Charlie Brenes, a veteran and junior majoring in psychology. “This time around, I’m trying to be very proactive.”
At the welcome event, student veterans mingled with other student veterans, met Greene and visited a variety of tables with representatives from the Department of Veteran Affairs, the SC Veterans Club, the L.A. County Department of Veteran Affairs and other organizations and resources on campus and in the greater Los Angeles area.
Alan Takagi, an Iraq war veteran and senior majoring in history, said he has seen a dramatic change in the university’s attention toward veterans since he started taking classes in the fall of 2005.
“I didn’t find one thing that connected me,” Takagi said. “When you’re talking to a bunch of 18-year-olds about war … it’s not very personal.”
But Takagi said that his feeling on campus has now changed.
“What I’ve noticed the past couple of years is that USC is acknowledging that there are more veterans coming in,” Takagi said. “There’s been an understanding that we need to give them attention.”
In 2008, about 80 veteran students enrolled at USC, said Robert Morley, associate registrar for the Academic Records and Registrar department. This year 421 veteran students are enrolled, and Morley expects that number to grow to about 500 in coming weeks.
Morley conducted a study of resources available to veterans on campus last year after Provost Elizabeth Garrett asked if the university was doing everything possible to best serve those who had served in the military, he said.
“In the end, it was very clear that we weren’t doing nearly enough for our veterans,” said Morley, who also looked at veteran resources and services at about 50 other universities during the study.
One of the chief recommendations of the study was that Student Affairs create a new support resource for veterans, said Michael Jackson, vice president of Student Affairs.
“It wasn’t until we did a study to find out what was actually needed did we realize we needed to put an office together,” Jackson said.
The university also identified a need to provide transfer students with similar services, so Student Affairs decided to combine them, Jackson said.
“We’re excited about getting the program off this year,” Jackson said. “We’ll learn more over the next several years to make sure that we have a good understanding of what veteran students need and what transfer students need.”
Thank you SC, for letting a former Marine and community college transfer attend your school. I am grateful for the “real college” experience of a big campus, huge lecture halls, gorgeous female student body, dorms (albeit I didn’t live in one), a larger than life football team, and a prestigious academic program. It was night and day, coming from a lil’ o’ humble jr. college. 
However, I wouldn’t do it all over again if given the choice. I felt lonely; the students were aloof despite my efforts to reach out to them (and I understand because of the rigorous academics and everyone’s pressure to compete); I felt “behind” because those who came in as freshmen got the headstart when it came to internships, etc. My morale fell while attending. 
For community college transfers and military vets (enlisted), I highly suggest you research the “big university” lifestyle prior to coming. If I could do it all over again, I’d have opted for a “commuter school” instead. At least the academics are commensurate to a jr. college’s, and you won’t feel as out-of-place socially, as I did. The “big university” lifestyle and glamor to it wasn’t worth it to me…But for those who had a good time here, more power to you. It’s all good…because I still root for Trojans during football season.

The Dept. of Public Safety, the Los Angeles Police Department and Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control are implementing a joint strategy to prevent irresponsible drinking at USC, after significant problems last year.
Last weekend was the first stage of DPS’ new long-term strategy. DPS kicked the semester off with a “trap door” operation, hoping an increase in citations would send a message that it takes alcohol abuse seriously.
Friday night resulted in five people arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, one arrest for misdemeanor traffic warrant and 12 traffic citations for an improper license DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
An LAPD DUI checkpoint Saturday night sent an influx of law enforcement to the streets around USC.
Four vehicles were also impounded when the driver was either unlicensed or driving on a suspended or revoked driver’s license, Carlisle said. Eight students were cited for alcohol violations, including four students who were transported to the hospital with alcohol poisoning.
“We take alcohol abuse seriously,” Carlisle said. “We will not tolerate this. Students need to be responsible.”
The university saw an increasing trend in toxic drinking toward the end of last semester as the number of hospital runs spiked considerably, Carlisle said. He said this concerned USC officials, so this year DPS says it will do everything in its power to ensure this does not happen again.
DPS said that such dangerous drinking could have dire consequences.
“We don’t want to see a repeat of last year,” said DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas. “Eventually someone is going to die. I would rather send a strong message now than see that happen.”
Carlisle said misbehaving does not just affect individual students but also the entire community. The more attention law enforcement puts on students, the less they have for the surrounding community.
“Every time a student is transported, they have to pull firemen to help that drunk student, and that affects the surrounding community,” Carlisle said. “The more DPS does not have to be involved in this issue it can free us up to take care of other issues.”
To help solve this issue and to curb excessive drinking on campus, DPS wants all students to know it is taking action.
“The key to being safe is smart decision making,” Carlisle said. “You’re not going to get in trouble if you stick around to help. Trojans care for Trojans.”
Students expressed mixed reactions to the DPS crackdown.
Tess Aktinson, a junior majoring in business and psychology, said there were inconsistencies in DPS’ handling of underage drinking and drinking in public.
“[DPS] is doing a lot of freshman programming and that is a good, proactive way to go about it,” Aktinson said. “It would be nice if there were clearer policies in place that the entire campus was behind. I know [DPS] is cracking down on open containers right now, but during football games all that goes out the window.”
Michael Ramires, an undeclared sophomore, said to end underage and public drinking, the university needs to adopt permanent policies forbidding such actions.
“[The DPS crackdown] will work in the sense that it will calm things down a bit,” Ramires said. “But the problem is this is just temporary. Students won’t care anymore about the fear of getting caught. That will wear off if this is just one big display instead of being consistent with citing people.”
This is not college ACB and these comments are ridiculous. As for the article- if DPS wants to crack down, that’s completely fine- but the scene at the football game was ridiculous yesterday. I saw almost riots and policemen physically grabbing girls who had done nothing harmful and weren’t even overly toxicated. That is a huge concern.
Nice comments Suni but where you party matters.   I would stick to the established frats like Sigma Chi & ATO where they know how to drink.  A lot of those other frats are amateurs and have significantly more transports.
The safest place to drink is at a fraternity house. All houses have active risk management teams, many have members who have gone through EMT training, and The Row is closely monitored and protected by DPS.
Students should get off the streets and out of their cars and get to The Row.
Yes, Suni, especially if students like getting raped.

The Annenberg Innovation Lab, an effort to expand digital media resources and opportunities among all students, opened its doors to the USC public Tuesday with a well-attended open house event.
Gadgets · Robert Harkness, a senior majoring in fine arts, makes a presentation about prototype interactive advertisements to Julie Bàez, a sales and marketing agent, and Isaac Cochilla, an alumnus of the class of 2010. - George Chearswat | Daily Trojan
Students presented projects they had completed with the help of the Innovation Lab’s interactive and creative lab space, where they can discuss different research projects and ideas that range from new business models and different institutional designs to societal incentives and the economical and political impact of social networking.
Located on the first floor of the Annenberg building, the Innovation Lab provides new experiences and knowledge that can be translated into any major, said Jonathan Taplin, director of the Innovation Lab.
The lab contains a state of the art conference room, equipped with 3D video-conferencing, and other multimedia features that help further the research of the students and faculty.
A goal of the lab is to combine students from different schools, including the Marshall School of Business and the Rossier School of Education, and situate them together, allowing them to come up with innovative and novel ideas that change the application of digital multimedia in journalism and other mediums.
This idea for an interdisciplinary learning program in the Annenberg Innovation Lab first spawned when an executive from IBM spoke at USC, said Henry Jenkins, provost’s professor of communication, journalism and cinematic arts.
“There were many ideas of where media was going [in the future],” Taplin said. “But there was no way of creating a prototype of research models because there was no specific facility for students to build these ideas at the time.”
The IBM executive convinced Ernest James Wilson III, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, to set up a lab and appointed Taplin as the director.
Since then, other companies, including Verizon, Cisco, Intel and Warner Brothers, have sponsored the prototypes and research of students in the Innovation Lab.
Students from any school at USC can join the Annenberg Innovation Lab and can choose to either launch a new project or join an existing team.
Jessica Wang, a graduate student in strategic public relations, is confident that projects at the Innovation Lab will produce exciting results.
“The lab is a very friendly and casual environment,” Wang said. “An idea will definitely pop up from this environment.”
After attending the open house, Paige Brettingen, a graduate student in journalism, wants to take part in projects at the Innovation Lab.
“Some of the projects presented tonight [were] fascinating,” Brettingen said. “I am looking forward to joining the lab.”
