Navigating the choppy waters of college dating is a visceral experience for many freshmen. Not that you develop an understanding of it after your first year — I have found that for many, the waters remain just as choppy for all four years. Companionship is a primal need, and dating rituals have been documented throughout the centuries in literature, paintings and sociological studies.
College dating could be an anthropological study in human behavior for millennials. A traditional date is virtually nonexistent in college. Many enjoyed the conventional dating scene in high school just a few short months ago, so why the sudden change?
Within the first two months on campus, you begin to realize that this is not your hometown and you are on your own. From my small amount of research, I hope to provide some insight for a balanced, healthy dating experience.
I have found that students who went to boarding schools have the least amount of trouble adapting to college dating. I initially assumed it was because of a lack of daily parental supervision, but that was last on their list of factors. The first thing to consider is the accessibility and proximity to your newfound friends. Your best friend now lives directly across the hall from you, and the person you have a crush on lives just in the next building, not across town. There is no waiting to see that person unless you decide to make yourself wait instead of inviting them out with you.
The lack of daily parental influence, though, is a factor. Unlike in high school, your parents are not driving you both around in those first couple of years or disapproving of your choices in junior and senior year, when many parents can put a stop to the relationship. It becomes a free-for-all, as several students explained it to me. While it might sound like the college atmosphere, the basic difference is that boarders were still young and keeping things in check while they eased into their new life. Alcohol was not readily available, nor were Greek parties. Before graduation, however, most had firsthand knowledge of the art of the casual “hook-up.”
Millennials have been labeled as the “All About Me” generation, obsessed with casual sex and instant gratification. But why? Some students felt that we are overwhelmed by our academics, athletics and social clubs that allow for absolutely no time for that one special person during college. In other words, I’m like a kid in a candy store for the first time and I want to try everything. Sex on college campuses has been around forever, so why has dating been thrown to the wayside? A very good male friend of mine explains it very simply: We don’t have to.  Very good female friends have a more complicated answer: Why set yourself up for disappointment? Don’t be fooled by someone that you’ve just met at a frat party who thinks, “Do you want to hang out?” means going to dinner and a movie.  My friends giggle that the movie will probably end up being on a laptop in his bedroom. So you might as well have the upper hand. Make the no-strings-attached hook-up your idea. Personally, I think it is the lack of respect our generation has for one another. I imagine the truth about dating lies somewhere in between.
Sociologist Paula England, Ph.D., conducted an online study of 20,000 college students from across the United States between 2005 and 2011. It showed that 61 percent of men and 68 percent of women do want a meaningful relationship. So the following dos and don’ts will go on the premise that Dr. England is correct. Let us dissect the first semester of freshmen year.
Ease up on yourself, and realize at least once in everyone’s college years you have been played. And guess what? So have they.
Don’t follow the crowd. You’ve already done that in high school. It’s not easy to break away from your group of friends because everyone wants to feel included. It’s okay not to be. Expand your horizons. Dump the mean girls and boys in your life.
Join a club that you love. You will find like-minded friends. Class is also a great place to start.
Do not give up on your true self. You can have a great time without giving up. That love of your life will come around.
Don’t gossip about your dates.
By the time you leave college, most students will have been dumped or have had a one-night stand. Both will make you stronger. Numerous one night stands, however, will not.
If you are being asked out over a text, it is most likely a booty call. Be up-front. Be nice.
Demand an in-person explanation if you have been stood up. Sometimes there are legitimate reasons.
Do not go to a party without a very good friend to watch out for you. On occasion, everyone imbibes a bit too much, which severely clouds judgment for both genders. Have a safety net in place.

Imagine gathering a group of close friends in your living room to taste home-baked pies. The taste-testing session would be designed as an art critique, with people analyzing aspects such as flavor, texture and appearance. In preparation for KCRW’s 6th Annual Good Food Pie Contest last Sunday, friends Alina Bezdikian, J.P. Bolles and Pat O’Brien conducted this process every week starting in June.
High profile · Jonathan Gold, an award-winning food critic for the Los Angeles Times, announced the winner of the competition. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
After entering the contest last year on a whim, Bezdikian, Bolles and O’Brien were determined to produce a winning pie.
“Last year we came into it totally blind, and it was totally for fun,” Bolles said. “Seeing the community and seeing hundreds of people getting together eating pie is just an amazing thing. So we were like, ‘Let’s keep doing this and see if we can actually get good at it.’”
Hundreds of hopeful bakers submitted their best recipes to the contest, which was held at UCLA’s Wilson Plaza, next to the Fowler Museum. Home cooks and professionals alike competed for top honors in seven categories: cream, cooked custard, fruit, nut, savory, vegan and world pies.
Up until Saturday night, Bezdikian, Bolles and O’Brien revised their recipe, ultimately settling on an apple and browned butter pie. They won the coveted award for best crust and placed second in the popular fruit category, which had 139 entries alone.
Evan Kleinman, host of KCRW’s “Good Food” podcast, emceed the afternoon’s festivities, which featured an artisanal marketplace, live music and cooking-themed activities for children. Contestants baked two of each pie they submitted — one for the judges and a second to serve to attendees.
Despite Los Angeles’s reputation for having  health-conscious residents, the event attracted hundreds of eager attendees.
“It’s just fun and everyone’s happy,” attendee Andrea Gunadi said. “People don’t just have their eye on the pie. It feels very communal.”
Bezdikian echoed Gunadi’s sentiment.
“The sharing with friends and community aspect of this has definitely been my favorite part,” Bezdikian said.
Some of Los Angeles’s most notable food writers and pastry chefs served as judges, including Na Young Ma of Proof Bakery, Valerie Gordon of Valerie Confections and Zoe Nathan of Huckleberry Bakery & Café.
Jonathan Gold, Pulitzer Prize-winning food critic for the Los Angeles Times, announced the Best in Show. Gold said that selecting the winner inspired a controversial debate about the definition of a pie. While the judges held differing views on the issue, they agreed that Allison Brooker’s chicken pot pie galette wowed on the basis of flavor alone.
“So without further ado, the year that a galette won the pie contest, like a camel winning the Kentucky Derby, we award the Best in Show to the chicken pot pie galette by Allison Brooker,” Gold said.

Menus that list “Black Olive Brittle and Goat Cheese” or “Tomato Water and Ojai Olive Oil Sherbert,” are usually hanging in cool tapas restaurants, not the neighborhood ice cream parlor. In Southern California, however, artisan desserts have expanded to include atypical flavors that are more often associated with savory foods.
Unique flavors · Salt & Straw offers new flavors such as “Black Olive Brittle and Goat Cheese” and “Tomato Water Ojai Olive Oil Sherbert.” – Rebecca Siegel | Daily Trojan
Perhaps it came as no surprise, then, that hip, Portland, Oregon-based creamery Salt & Straw, announced that it would be opening up a shop in Hancock Park last month.
Originating from an ice cream cart with an iconic red and white awning, Salt & Straw is yet another trendy joint to stop and soothe the dry heat of Santa Ana winds. Boasting imaginative flavors and locally sourced ingredients, this new addition to Hancock Park’s hip Larchmont Avenue hits the creativity mark while abandoning tradition at the door.
Americans can’t get enough of plain old vanilla ice cream — it constitutes nearly 17 percent of all ice cream orders, according to a poll done by GrubHub analytics. Salt & Straw’s founders, cousins Kim and Tyler Malek, took the idea of classic ice cream flavors and turned them on their heads, using unconventional ingredients in addition to giving their take on some classic ice cream shop stalwarts. For an example of the latter, Salt & Straw’s unique vanilla flavor comes from a single source of vanilla beans in Uganda.
A handwritten menu hangs on three different chalkboards above the hardwood ice cream bar. On the farthest left hang “Classics,” in the middle, seasonal flavors or, “Early Autumn Harvest flavors,” and on the right, “Sundaes, Milkshakes, Floats, and Drinks.”
Despite the variety of flavors and unique ingredients, Salt & Straw’s menu is pretty straightforward. The ice cream shop serves classic and seasonal flavors by the single or double scoop, or, for the more indecisive, in four-flavor “flights.”
The Maleks emphasize how they have tried to create a menu that reflects the culinary topography of Los Angeles as well as use all of the local farms and distilleries, creameries and confectionaries that the region has to offer. For example, the GRAND POPPY Sorbet is made from a locally-distilled poppy liqueur. It’s evident Salt & Straw aims to distinguish itself from the average milkshake and sundae shops with its unique flavors and local ingredients.
All hardwood and vintage lettering, the Larchmont location is reminiscent of a soda shop from the 1950s or 1960s, and patrons can expect lines out the door on a weekend afternoon. The staff at Salt & Straw, however, is efficient at helping patrons navigate through some of the wordier menu options. It’s hard to say whether or not it would be wise to pair the “Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons,” with the “Cinnamon Apple Doughnuts” or the “Santa Ynez Valley Walnut Oil,” but Salt & Straw’s staff is more than up to the task.
After working their way through the line and approaching the spotless glass barrier in between themselves and the ice cream, customers will have the opportunity to choose crazy flavors and walk the line between ice cream as a sweet and savory snack with the incredibly cheesy “Black Olive Brittle and Goat Cheese.” For a more traditional afternoon dessert, try the kid-friendly “Salted, Malted, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,” which is rich and full of real homemade cookie dough bites.
The “Santa Ynez Valley Walnut Oil,” is a gem on the “Classics” section of the menu. In line, customers will hear the staff recommend it again and again to patrons wondering what to pair with the outlandish “GRAND POPPY Sorbet.”
The “Santa Ynez Valley Walnut Oil” has a subtle taste that doesn’t get overpowered by other flavors and pairs nicely with basically anything else. It’s even what the staff uses to make their root beer float, since it’s not quite as sweet as the “Single Origin Amadeus Vanilla.”
For those looking to try the seasonal menu, the “California Peaches with Lemon Crumble,” is a nice place to start. A smooth lemon ice cream interrupted only by chunks of sticky sweet peach jam, it’s great to pair with “Single Origin Amadeus Vanilla,” but anything else would be too sweet.
Anyone who needs to be eating something chocolate flavored to truly be eating ice cream can try the very rich — but very delicious — “Chocolate Almond and Caramel Cheesecake,” which is a little nutty, a little salty and not at all too sweet or overpowering. For the real chocolate lover, it goes really well with the smooth and rich “Chocolate Gooey Brownie.” For those not so inclined to chocolate everything, the “Santa Ynez Valley Walnut Oil” is a great pair as well.
With all the bells and whistles of a classic ice cream shop and creative flavors — some of which are exclusive to the Los Angeles location — Salt & Straw is a must-stop on any one of fall’s sunny afternoons.
 
Salt & Straw is located in Windsor Square at 240 N. Larchmont Blvd., Los Angeles. The ice cream shop is open daily from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.

If someone were to look at the new movies coming out this weekend they might be confused to see The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby sitting amongst the new releases. They would rightly wonder why a movie that was released weeks before to tepid critical reaction is suddenly sitting pretty in the “opening this week” section of Rotten Tomatoes.
Let’s try this again · Originally released as one condensed film, the release of the original cut of two consecutive films brings out a far superior film that succeeds in every place where the original failed. – Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
 
It’s confusing, but this is not the same movie, and this newly released version is the far superior version of the two. This weekend, The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her/Him is being released. It is a full hour and 20 minutes longer than the previously released The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them. It is, in fact, two films played in succession telling the same story first from the perspective of “her,” Jessica Chastain’s character, Eleanor Rigby. Then, after Her finishes, the same exact story is told through the eyes of “him,” James McAvoy’s Conor Ludlow, in Him.
This is format in which director Ned Benson originally envisioned this film. The Weinstein Company, however, cut the two films into one standalone film (Them), citing a need to make the film more concise and commercial. That version was the one that the public received first, and that Frankenstein’s monster of a film was an unsurprising disappointment. The business decision to aim for a more commercial version of such an artistically oriented film is especially disappointing because it distracts from a truly great film in Her/Him.
Her focuses on Chastain’s character, making it the superior film of the two solely due to the sheer force of her acting. Chastain’s Eleanor leaves her husband after grief over the death of their child wears their marriage down. What we see is nothing new: She clashes with her family, runs into her husband, and bonds with a wise, candid elder. It’s pretty standard life-in-crisis fare. Chastain lifts it all up, however, with her powerful yet nuanced performance. She keeps proving that she is one of the very best actors in the business with every new release. She makes a series of complex emotional situations seem completely natural.
Him focuses on McAvoy’s character. It’s a more toned-down film as he deals with her departure as well as with moving in with his father and his struggling restaurant. McAvoy’s acting is less obviously great than Chastain’s, but he still packs a solid punch. His character struggles with expressing his emotions, so his restrained performance was always going to appear less impressive than Chastain’s pyrotechnic emotional display. But McAvoy, being the talented young actor that he is, carries the film as well.
What really emerges from watching Him is the interplay between the two films. This is what elevates the combined film into uniquely fascinating territory. While watching Her, you see glimpses of McAvoy’s Conor, popping up intermittently in the story. His actions are understood through the perspective of Eleanor. But, once you see the same scenes through his eyes, the two films develop into a Rashomon-esque study on the effect a different point of view can have on a story. The effect created by watching two entire films that dovetail into one another like this just could not be recreated in one combined film. Them tried to recreate this as best it could, but the overlapping scenes lacked the sheer wealth of context that having an entire stand-alone movie surrounding them can bring. What appears to be selfish on the part of Conor when seen through Eleanor’s eyes is much more justified when seen through his. Offhand comments about events that happened off screen are seen first-hand and woven into the story. Things that Eleanor does in her storyline that seem perfectly reasonable from her point of view, when seen again in Him, are perceived as irrational and hurtful. The importance of the plot of the film shrinks as these effects become more and more interesting.
Though most of the layers in the story are revealed when off-camera events in one point of view are shown or explained through distinct eyes, the overlapping scenes are handled beautifully as well. At face value they seem to be the same exact scenes, and if one wasn’t paying close attention, they’d miss a bevy of small differences. Some scenes are shot from slightly changed angles or acted slightly differently or lines of dialogue are delivered in a slightly modified way or, in one very important case, delivered by the other character. Though much more subtle, these differences recall the variations in memory that Rashomon examined so well. Eleanor and Conor remember the moments they spent together in contrasting ways and that further colors their perceptions of everything else that happens.
It’s not often that a movie can be favorably compared to Rashomon, one of the greatest films of all time, but the examinations that Her/Him are able to create with their interlocking films manages to approach those heights. Of course, the genius of Akira Kurosawa allowed him to make his point in a lean, impeccably directed 88 minutes where writer/director Ned Benson needed 201, but the fact that he’s even in that conversation is very high praise. The expanded, original version of the film is the only version that should have existed in the first place and is worth all three hours and 20 minutes a viewer needs to invest to enjoy it.

USC’s women’s golf team outplayed the competition and took home first place at the Windy City Collegiate Championship yesterday. The team, which was coming off of a sixth-place finish at the ANNIKA Intercollegiate, had a combined final score of 12-over 876 (294-287-295). Northwestern, Iowa State, Arizona and Oklahoma State rounded out the top five, respectively.

The Woman of Troy enjoyed a successful first day of competition at the Windy City Collegiate Championship. The team was led by junior Annie Park, who returned to the team this week,  after qualifying for the final round of the LPGA “Q” school. The team had a six-stroke lead after the first day with a score of 5-over 581 (294-287). Northwestern and Oklahoma State rounded out the top three teams. Park finished the day at 2-under 142 (73-69) which put her in fourth place in her first competitive day of the year.
Senior Doris Chen tied for sixth and sophomore Karen Chung tied for ninth. Chen had five birdies in the first two rounds while Chung had five birdies in the second round, enough to help her recover from her first 18 holes. Other results from the first two rounds included sophomore Gabriella Then tying for 26th, sophomore transfer Elizabeth Doty tying for 37th and junior Victoria Morgan tying for 66th.
On Tuesday, Park led her team and finished atop the individual leaderboard with a final score of 5-under 211 (73-69-69).
“It was really fun to be back around the team after being gone for the previous tournament,” Park said. “Collectively, we had a good plan to attack this really difficult golf course and I’m very pleased with the way we played both days.”
Chen had another successful outing on Tuesday as well, finishing in a tie for fourth with an even score of 216 (71-73-72). Sophomore Karen Chung struggled after an impressive first day and fell to a tie for 19th in the individual rankings with a score of 6-over 222 (75-70-77). Junior Victoria Morgan made a jump in the rankings and finished in a tie for 54th with a score of 26-over 232 (78-80-74). Other results from the tournament included Then tying for 37th at 12-over 228 (75-70-77) and sophomore transfer Elizabeth Doty tying for 41st at 13-over 229 (75-77-77).
“Thankfully we were able to pull out the win,” said women’s head coach Andrea Gaston. “Annie [Park] had a really strong back 9 that helped lead the team to the title, and Doris [Chen] hung in there with a top 4 finish. The Windy City lived up to its name.”
The men’s team struggled on the first day of competition at the Nike Golf Collegiate. The team finished the first day in seventh place with a 22-over 582 (293-289) putting them 14 strokes behind first place Oregon. Washington and Texas were second and third after the first day. Freshman Sean Crocker tied for seventh with a combined score of 1-over 141 (73-68), which led his team after the first day of competition.
Sophomore Rico Hoey overcame his six bogeys with four birdies to finish the day in a tie for 10th at 3-over 143 (72-71). Other results from the first day included senior Eric Sugimoto tied for 28th at 8-over 148 (74-74) and both junior Bobby Gojuangco and freshman Jonah Teixeira tied for 43rd at 11-over 151.
The Trojans improved from their first day of competition by moving up a placement and finishing in sixth place in the inaugural Nike Golf Collegiate. The team finished with a combined score of 32-over 872 (293-289-290). Oregon finished in first place with a final score of 11-over 851. Stanford, Oklahoma, Washington and Texas rounded out the top five.
Crocker climbed the player leaderboard on Tuesday and finished in fourth place with a final score of 2-under 208 (73-68-67).
“We were extremely fortunate to play a famous PGA Tour course this week, Colonial Country Club. It was a true test and we had one player in particular meet the challenge in freshman Sean Crocker,” said men’s head coach Chris Zambri. “He played beautifully all three rounds.”
Hoey had a rough final day of the tournament and dropped 12 spots in the standings and finished with a 10-over 220. Sugimoto finished in a tie for 29th with a final score of 12-over 222. Other results from the day included Gojuangco by finishing in a tie for 43rd at 15-over 225 and Texeira finished in a tie for 46th at 16-over 226.
The Women of Troy will head up to Palo Alto, California, for the Stanford Intercollegiate from Oct. 17-19. Next up for the men’s team is the Bill Cullum Invitational in Simi Valley, California, from Oct. 20-21.

It was a controversial call.
I knew a lot of the student body would disagree with it. But when my father made the offer, I knew I couldn’t pass it down.
On Saturday, I decided to take my talents to Chavez Ravine.
Fail Mary · Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard led the Trojans in tackles against ASU, but failed to defend the Hail Mary pass as time expired. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
I skipped the Arizona State game and instead went to see the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 2 of the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers with my dad. I love watching USC sports, but the Cardinals are definitively my No. 1 team, so it wasn’t too tough of a decision. Even though the Redbirds fell 3-2, I’m happy with my choice. Not just because I avoided seeing the Trojans’ what-just-happened 38-34 loss, but also because the Cardinals clinched the series in four games yesterday and I got to see almost all of it.
The weekend was a perfect reminder of why I love sports. Though I didn’t see a miraculous comeback win in Game 2 of the NLDS, I saw just that during Game 1 on Friday. Down 6-1 against the Dodgers’ ace Clayton Kershaw, the Cardinals came back to take a 10-6 lead and held on to win by a final score of 10-9. Matt Carpenter stroked an epic three-run double that turned out to be the game-winning hit, and that at-bat alone was worth the price of admission from both games.
There were plenty of upset Dodger fans on Friday, just as there were plenty of upset USC fans Saturday. Both were games that the home team let slip away, and both fan bases placed plenty of blame on the coaching staff for costing their team a win. There are definitely parallels in these L.A. sports stories, but I would attribute both results to the natural idiosyncrasies of sports and not to any major coaching blunder.
About every single caller on the Dodger talk radio show after Game 1 blamed the loss on Dodgers manager Don Mattingly. He should have brought in a reliever much earlier during the Cardinals’ rally, callers and hosts agreed, because Kershaw was clearly running out of gas and the bullpen would have prevented the Cards from taking the lead. Of course, once Mattingly did call in Pedro Baez to relieve Kershaw, Baez walked the first batter he faced then served up a three-run homer to Matt Holliday. But every Dodger caller was still pretty confident that the bullpen should have been trusted earlier over the defending Cy Young Award winner.
Then in Game 2, after Zack Greinke pitched a solid seven shutout innings for the Dodgers, Mattingly called in reliever J.P. Howell. The bases were empty, and Greinke didn’t appear to be in any trouble. But Mattingly obviously wanted to give the ball to bullpen to prevent Greinke from getting in trouble if he were to run out of stamina that inning. Not only did Howell have a scoreless appearance in Game 1, but he also matched up well against the next three left-handed Cardinal hitters as a lefty himself.
Sure enough, the first batter Howell faced singled, Carpenter then tied the game with a two-run homer and Howell was finally chased after Jon Jay followed with a single. The stadium echoed with boos as Mattingly took the ball from Howell and called in a new reliever. Plenty of fans in earshot shouted expletives at the Dodger skipper, incredulous that Mattingly could possibly throw away another game by mismanaging the bullpen. On Friday, he obviously called the bullpen too late, and on Saturday, he obviously called it too early.
By Game 3 of the series, the postgame commentary had reached a much more rational conclusion. Mattingly wasn’t mismanaging the bullpen, the Dodger bullpen was simply underperforming. After surrendering a two-run home run in the eighth inning to Kolten Wong, the Dodgers bullpen had an ERA of over 8.50 in three games, more than double the 3.80 ERA the team had in the regular season. No matter what he did, Mattingly couldn’t rely on anyone other than his starters, and even his best starter, who was so dominant all season, was underperforming. As SB Nation’s Steven Goldman said so perfectly in a headline, “Maybe God hates Don Mattingly, but you don’t have to.”
So with that in mind, I’m going to respectfully disagree with some of the assessments made by fellow Daily Trojan sports columnists Jake Davidson and Euno Lee. I’ll play the devil’s advocate in this case. And by devil’s advocate, I actually do mean the Sun Devils’ advocate, because I think Saturday has much more to do with Arizona State playing really well than USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox making mistakes.
It’s been five games. The USC defense has looked really good in three of them and really bad in two of them  — OK, maybe Fresno State’s lackluster offense diminishes some of the value of the season opener, but big performances against Stanford and Oregon State should be weighed just as heavily as disappointing performances against BC and Arizona State.
As both Jake and Euno discussed, Wilcox’s defense is a relatively conservative “bend, don’t break” scheme without a ton of pass rushing. It’s very different from former dominating USC defenses that lived and died by pressure and forcing turnovers. Though it may not be as exciting to watch, I don’t think this scheme is inherently flawed.
Physically and aggressively overpowering teams is very hard with sanction-limited depth. Though sitting back in coverage might mean getting picked apart by a red-hot opposing QB, as we saw with ASU’s Mike Bercovici, calling a bunch of blitzes might not even get penetration with the injuries ’SC has suffered on defense.
And yes, the last-second Hail Mary was brutal, but I still wouldn’t necessarily put that on the coaching staff. You can practice that play over and over again, but no environment will ever be able to simulate the mental pressure and chaos of the final play of a game. Ever been explained something in a lecture then forget to put in your essay during a two-hour midterm? (I don’t have a 4.0, either). Likewise, no amount of regular season experience can prepare an All-Star pitcher for the pressure of a playoff atmosphere. I can’t sit here and say I expect any athlete to be immune to this pressure when I can’t even passively watch the action without getting really nervous.
Ultimately, in competition, your opponent’s performance has just as big of an impact on the results as yours. Sure, there are always problems to fix and improvements to make, but there isn’t necessarily a problem with a process because of its result. USC doesn’t need to fire Wilcox after the loss; we just all have to applaud the Sun Devils. Similarly, the Dodgers don’t need to trade Kershaw and fire Mattingly; they just need to tip their caps to the high-flying Cardinals.

The Trojan football team emphasized bouncing back at practice on Tuesday following its 38-34 loss to Arizona State this weekend. USC will face No. 10 Arizona in Tucson this weekend, a crucial game if the Trojans are to achieve their goal of becoming Pac-12 South champions.
Band of brothers · Freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith said the heart-wrenching Hail Mary loss to ASU on Saturday is bringing the team closer together. Smith is averaging 41.3 receiving yards per game. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Closer Through Adversity
The Trojans suffered a loss Saturday night that launched USC into unfamiliar territory for the first time this season: unranked anonymity. The Trojans have shown resilience many times already this season, and they look to do so once again.
“[It] brings us even closer as a team,” freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith said of the loss. “When you lose a game, you get frustrated, it’s as a team.”
This is certainly not the ideal team bonding activity, but the team has responded with a go-get-’em attitude and by practicing hard with the idea of redemption on their mind. Junior wide receiver and team captain Nelson Agholor stood firm in his belief that hard work in practice will show results in the game to come.
“We are handling practice and taking care of the things we can take care of today,” Agholor said. “You learn from the good and the bad. The outcome was a miscue, now you get to learn from that. It shouldn’t be a repeated mistake. Our demeanor and the way we react to it will be contagious.”
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian  highlighted the positives of the game following Tuesday’s practice.
“The beauty of football is that we get to get back on the horse,” he said. “You can have a tough loss and you get a chance to redeem yourself.”
Boom Boom Pow?
The Trojans have gotten heat for their underachieving offense and lack of highlight reel worthy plays. A big factor in this is the lack of “explosive plays.” Though redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen is ranked 17th in the nation with 115.2 yards per game this season, he is only averaging 5.28 yards per carry.
“There’s a lot that we’re doing really well right now,” Sarkisian said. “The explosive plays piece is something that I’d really like to improve on. Generally when you put emphasis on something as a coach, you get a return.”
Sarkisian drew attention to the Trojans’ superb ball control, pointing out that redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler has yet to throw an interception through five games.
The offense took blame for the lack of razzle dazzle and agreed that the team needs to make improvements on that side of the ball.
“The bottom line is we didn’t score enough points and that’s on me, that’s on the offense,” Kessler said. “If another team scores 100 points then we have to score 101. We’ve got to give our defense a better cushion.”
Injury Update
Sophomore long snapper Zach Smith has still not been cleared for play. He suffered a concussion against Oregon State and did not play against Arizona State. His presence was sorely missed as Kessler was forced to punt the ball four times, often giving ASU improved field position.
Senior safety Gerald Bowman has a deep thigh bruise and redshirt senior tight end Randall Telfer has a hip bruise. Neither injury is expected to prevent the players from participating in Saturday’s game.
 
Hate autocorrect but you get the msg. 
Will torch SC.
SC loses to UCLA, USA handle Notre Dame.  We may have a chance against Colorado. 
Until Sark hands over the OC cutie to Helton,  you can be assured of a Medicus offense. Wilcox is pricing he is still a rookie DC,  and Diane know what he’s doing. Socks will touch SC on Saturday.

With the surge of unauthorized immigration this year, the impulse to protect American borders seems more critical than ever for many citizens. In response to the influx, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has created immigration detention centers as temporary housing for undocumented immigrants before deportation. More are on the way. Within these detention centers, however, are serious risks for the detainees. Recently, women at one facility in southern Texas have allegedy experienced sexual abuse, bringing into question the safety of these shelters. Lawmakers should consider assigning female guards to these women and children in detention facilities to decrease such incidents.
According to CNN, women of Karnes Country Residential Center spoke out about sexual abuse by employees, claiming that they had been pulled from their cells at night for sexual favors and were fondled in front of children. In fact, guards offering immigration help, money and false promises for sex, has become a grave issue. In an almost unbelievable response to these allegations, Geo Group, Inc., which owns the center, denied all of these complaints stating, “The Karnes County Residential Center provides a safe, clean, and family-friendly environment for mothers and children awaiting required processing by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. The center provides high quality care, and our company strongly denies any allegations to the contrary.”
If anything, this denial of allegations heightens concerns rather than dismisses them. As Barbara Hines, co-director of the University of Texas Immigration Clinic said, “The government has no business detaining vulnerable mothers and children that it cannot protect from this type of abuse.”
Still, there’s no question that to manage the overwhelming number of illegal immigrants, there needs to be temporary shelter provided. Placing female guards and employees for these facilities could be a working solution. Bryan Robinson of ABC News said that according to the Justice Department, “Sex offenses are still very much a man’s crime.” In fact, in 1999, men were responsible for 96 percent of sexual assaults. With this in mind, more female guards in women and children centers should have an effect on the rate of sexual abuse in these centers, even though women can perpetrate sexual assaults in some cases as well. Beyond that, having female workers in such facilities will create a safer, more comfortable environment for female detainees, allowing them to feel more protected by these workers.
It is important to remember that even though women and children within these immigration centers lack legal status, they’re humans deserving of the same treatment as American citizens. Treating immigrants with respect for their human rights seems like a simple no-brainer, but it’s allegations like the ones against Karnes County Residential Center that remind us that sometimes, common sense is surprisingly lacking. Terms tossed around, such as “illegal alien,” make it easy to dehumanize our approach to sexual assault allegations coming from detention centers — and we need to fight that. The “us versus them” mentality sets a trap that becomes a danger not only for women and children detainees, but also for us as a people. After all, in the words of the American Civil Liberties Union, “When the government has the power to deny legal rights and due process to one vulnerable group, everyone’s rights are at risk.”

Greenhouse gases took center stage at the U.N. summit on climate change in late September, with more than 100 global leaders discussing the pledge to reduce emissions. President Barack Obama promised that America’s carbon emissions will be at least 17 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2020. Considering that energy production accounts for more of our country’s carbon emissions than any other contributor, it is clear that it is time to rely on a new primary source of energy. What many don’t realize, however, is that this alternative already exists in nuclear power.
Linda Xu | Daily Trojan
Nuclear power production has rapidly grown since the 1930s, but drew negative connotations after the well-known Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and, more recently, Fukushima accidents. Since 1996, global nuclear power production has dropped by 7 percent, as the general public and investors alike have increasingly favored solar and wind power.
After decades of slow nuclear power growth, a new reactor is set to open at the Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station in Tennessee within the next year. While several plants were decommissioned in the past few years, the Tennessee plant will be the first new commercial one finished in the United States since the turn of the century. Hopefully, this plant will spur a nuclear power revival in the United States.
This potential revival could be stalled by the negative stigma surrounding nuclear power. Concerns about safety, environmental impact and waste management cause many opponents to reject nuclear power as a viable energy option. Nevertheless, it’s time for opponents to realize that compared to other energy sources, including wind, solar and coal, nuclear energy is the best possible option. As with anything else, nuclear power might have its downsides, but the pros outweigh the cons.
One obvious reason that nuclear power is our best option for a new primary energy source is carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are one of the main contributors to the greenhouse effect, which in turn influences climate change. Coal energy production emits over 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of energy produced. Comparatively, nuclear power plants emit practically zero carbon dioxide while producing energy.
Today, the United States is one of the world’s top carbon dioxide emitters. Though the country can’t completely switch from coal power plants to nuclear power overnight, a gradual shift could set an example for other countries. If the United States went from being known as the country with the highest rates of carbon dioxide emissions per capita to the country with the lowest level of carbon dioxide emissions, other countries might reevaluate their own practices.
Proponents of other energy sources such as wind and solar argue that these energy sources also emit less carbon than coal. Wind farms and solar photovoltaic parks, however, occupy much more space than nuclear power plants. They can require anywhere between 50,000 and 180,000 acres, compared to an average of approximately 400 acres for a nuclear power plant.
In addition to using more space, solar and wind sources actually produce less energy than nuclear for each dollar spent on energy production. If one of these options became the United States’ primary energy source, we would be sacrificing vast amounts of space for a relatively small amount of energy.
Though nuclear energy sounds like the best option for the Earth, many worry about whether it is the best option for us. Past nuclear accidents have left people wary of possible disasters. But the Chernobyl accident, which opponents frequently cite as an example of the danger of nuclear power, occurred at a plant without concrete containment structures, a necessary safeguard to ensure that deadly radiation doesn’t escape into the atmosphere. Power plants in the United States include these containment structures, eliminating the threat of an accident similar to Chernobyl. Developers have learned from prior accidents, improving overall safety. The new Tennessee plant will be equipped with features such as back-up cooling systems and emergency equipment. Any other new U.S. plants would likely contain similar safety features.
Another major concern held by nuclear power’s opponents is the question of waste management. Nuclear reactors produce radioactive waste that is not biodegradable. Currently, this waste is frequently stored in on-site cooling vats, which experts consider an acceptable practice for now. The actual amount of waste produced by nuclear plants is relatively small, as “all the waste produced so far in the U.S. would only cover a football field about 5 yards deep,” according to the Wall Street Journal.
Thinking long-term, storing nuclear waste in these cooling vats essentially buys time for researchers to develop new solutions. Once public support for nuclear power increases, construction of new plants will bring about new developments. Increased investment can bring about improvements that alleviate the remaining problems with nuclear power.
The shift away from coal power plants can’t be completed quickly, so it’s imperative that we begin this change as soon as possible. Instead of waiting for a brand new miracle solution, it’s time to focus efforts on improving our best current option. It’s time to remove the stigma attached to nuclear power.
Relative safety…
Here is one way to compare the safety of our largest energy sources: Deaths Per Terra Watt Hour Produced.  Nuclear power is the safest – by far.
Cheers.
Nuclear power production didn’t exist in the 1930s.
