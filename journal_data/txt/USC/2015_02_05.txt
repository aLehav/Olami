The Leonard Davis School of Gerontology has announced the Merrill Lynch Longevity Training Program, a plan that will encourage financial advisors and retirement specialists to improve retirement planning for the nation’s elderly and their families.
The program was created to foster knowledge about the facets of managing individual finance with regard to longevity.
According to USC News, the new training program covers various advances in research throughout the field of gerontology. These include more advanced studies into the sociological, psychological and physiological elements which contribute to the science of aging.
Additionally, participants enrolled in the program will gain knowledge of longevity-based issues through the exploration of seven life priorities: health, home, family, giving, leisure, work and finances.
“As our society continues to rapidly age, anticipating and understanding the unique needs and dreams of older adults is more important than ever,” said Davis Dean Pinchas Cohen in a statement to USC News. “Increasing longevity can bring longer retirements, changing health care choices, more housing transitions and many other challenges to financial security and independence. By introducing gerontology knowledge to the financial advice they receive, we aim to help older individuals accomplish more of the goals they’ve set for themselves and their loved ones.”
Through its partnership with Merrill Lynch, Davis will offer insights into participants who successfully complete approximately 12 hours of training over the course of four to eight weeks. Successful completion of the longevity program will earn participants a certificate of completion from USC, as well as nine continuing education credits for Certified Financial Planner, Certified Investment Analyst or Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor professional designations.
Training for the longevity program consists of online, on-demand videos presented by USC professors and Merrill Lynch specialists such as Cyndi Hutchins, director of financial gerontology.
“We’ve partnered with one of the nation’s most prestigious universities, and a pioneer in the study of gerontology, to help ensure that our advisers and specialists have a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges presented by increasing longevity,” said David Tyrie, head of Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions for Merrill Lynch, in a statement released by USC News.

Three scientists from the Keck School of Medicine of USC have won grants from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine for research that includes creating a temporary liver for patients and developing new ways to treat immune disorders.
The grants are being awarded to USC Stem Cell principal investigators Paula Cannon, Qi-Long Ying and Toshio Miki as part of the CIRM Tools and Technologies Initiative, which supports projects that address the challenges of translating stem cell discoveries into cures.
The winners were chosen from a group of more than 200 proposals to design and create the key technologies needed for progress in the era of regenerative medicine.
“These awards are designed to help find ways […] to bridge the gaps in our knowledge and to ensure that the best research is able to keep progressing and move out of the lab and into clinical trials in patients,” said Jonathan Thomas, chair of CIRM’s governing board in a statement to USC News.
Miki’s team at USC’s Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research plans to develop what he calls an “extracorporeal liver support system” for patients suffering from liver failure.
The project overseen by Miki is an international collaboration with Katrin Zeilinger at Berlin’s Charité University, Frank Shubert at Stem Cell Systems GmbH, and Germany’s Federal Ministry for Education and Research.
Cannon and her colleagues are working to develop the next generation of targeted nucleases to treat blood diseases and severe immune deficiencies, such as sickle cell disease.
Her team has already developed a targeted nuclease that could potentially cure HIV/AIDS by introducing a gene mutation called CCR5 that confers natural immunity to HIV. Inspiration stemmed from the “Berlin patient,” a patient cured of both HIV and leukemia through a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a CCR5 mutation.
Ying, also at the Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, plans to use stem cell technology to create some of the world’s most sophisticated lab rats for use in research of new therapies for diabetes, heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases.
Ying is also collaborating with USC colleagues Justin Ichida, Bangyan Stiles and Ching-Ling “Ellen” Lien in his research efforts.

On Thursday night, USC’s Undergraduate Student Government hosted a presidential debate discussing the possibility of achieving greater integration amongst student athletes as well as bridging the divide between USG and the student body and other campus issues, in anticipation of  the USG election next week.
The event took place in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at 6:30 p.m. and featured formal debates between the USG presidential and vice presidential candidates. Executive Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Dan Schnur and Rachel Scott, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism, moderated the program.
The presidential candidates, Rini Sampath and Providence Ilisevich, began with opening statements to the audience of primarily USC students.
Sampath emphasized her and vice presidential candidate Jordan Fowler’s experienced backgrounds with USG, as Sampath is the current vice president and Fowler is director of university affairs.
“We really do have a track record of working with real results,” Sampath said. “We would love another year in office to continue implementing change. We’ve seen firsthand the impact student government can have, and with your vote, we can make that happen.”
Ilisevich described her experience as a USG senator, which included passing a resolution that implemented an extension of the drop deadline from three to seven weeks.
“The unique thing with being a senator is that you get to see so many different projects,” Ilisevich said. “You can choose to get involved in groups, committees and assemblies. There have only been two resolutions passed this year, and I passed one of them.”
Sampath discussed her work on the resolution of the Black House initiative and her research on similar projects at other universities.
“I’d love to see it as a stepping-stone for future projects,” Sampath said. “At Stanford University, they have a black house, a Chicano house. That’s what we need at USC. As student leaders, we need to recognize the importance of a black house and the importance of talking about marginalized groups on campus.”
Both candidates had strong stances on campus sexual assault and described strategies they would implement in office.
“We were able to bring light to the conversation on what consent means, what sexual assault looks like on this campus,” Sampath said. “We’ve had a joint force working on this front, and we decided this would be nice for a social media campaign and empowering fraternities on talking about this issue. We want to bring that kind of bystander intervention program to all 900 organizations on campus.”
Ilisevich discussed her work on the Greek Task Force and conversations with the Center for Women and Men as evidence of her strong stance on sexual assault, one she would maintain if elected.
“Consent is such a complicated  issue but also such an important issue that it takes more than just creating a Facebook page,” Ilisevich said. “Something we’ve discovered is it’s going to take a long time to get programming that’s really effective. It’s going to take an extra semester or so to make sure that’s as valuable as it can be.”
Candidates discussed improvements in the integration of USC athletes in the student body.
“They have this feeling that they’re left out of the conversation,” Sampath said. “We hope that will be a stepping-stone integrating them more in the community. That said, I think we don’t pay as much attention as we should to rec sports. We want to increase funding for rec sports, making it more accessible for all students to participate in sports, not just the varsity athletes.”
Ilisevich mentioned plans to add a position on USG that represented the voice of athletes on campus.
“I think there’s a lot of other aspects of the student experience for athletes that are underrepresented,” Ilisevich said. “Athletes don’t feel like they’re integrated with the student body. They’re here to have a well-rounded experience, and we want to create a position in USG that’s representative of athletics because it would help them to feel like they’re students here.”
During the vice presidential debate, Fowler cited successful projects such as the Uber-Campus Cruiser partnership, free LAX shuttle over spring break and water bottle filling stations on campus during her time as director of university affairs.
Vice presidential candidate Ehren Elder worked hard to implement LGBT programming in the Greek community. He has been involved in plenty of activities outside of Greek life as well, including being a spirit leader and orientation advisor.
As members of the Greek community, Fowler and Elder both responded to issues within the Greek system.
“There should be a conversation administrators have with students before sanctions or policies are implemented on The Row, so the Greek organizations are having a say,” Fowler said. “They live there, they go there the most, and so these conversations need to happen. I don’t think that is something most students want to take away from this university.”
Elder spoke to the tradition of the Greek community and how new policies have often stifled its purpose.
“This is more than just sanctions as well as policy changes,” Elder said. “We’ve seen an immense shift in the way fraternities are treated. There’s such a deep-rooted tradition of the Greek system here, and pulling that down with policy is unfortunate.”
Students in the audience reacted positively to the issues both tickets expressed.
“I liked both candidates’ responses to the questions about The Row and the athletes,” said Keith Keer, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering. “Incorporating the athletes into the student body is definitely something that the university should look into because no one really sees them in their classes or gets to know them; we only hear about them.”
“The debates represented both tickets and there were great overlaps, especially with regards to the sexual assault campaign,” said Katie Larson, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “Both are passionate and no matter who is elected, we are going to be in good hands.”

In a world defined by social networking, one cannot escape the influence it has on everyday life. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, though entertaining, do not often bring elevated content and drive personal introspection. Through RIZZARR, Ashley Michelle Williams intends to add a more intentionally intellectually stimulating dimension to social media.
Williams is the CEO and founder of RIZZARR, a new form of social networking and multimedia platform designed to inspire young people to share resonant content such as news articles or interesting studies rather than filtered photos of their best friend’s birthday cake.
“I always felt that there was a need for a space for young people to talk and connect on, and to encourage and inspire each other,” Williams said.
With this in mind, Williams created a social network that allows millenials to not only share timely content they find on the Internet, but to also create content themselves. RIZZARR is like an Internet-accessible coffeehouse bulletin board, as it brings together current news and events with articles, prose, poetry and opinion pieces generated by users. Most importantly, Williams intends for RIZZARR to be a safe starting point for new ideas.
“Millennials can really drive change, and I think that goes to the heart of what RIZZARR is, especially by combining it with a platform of constructive thought,” Williams said.
RIZZARR lets users choose a pseudonym or a pen name so that it is only the opinions of users that are judged, as opposed to more superficial aspects like how they look or what they choose to wear. As a consequence of this, a social network maintained on RIZZARR can become a support system for users instead of a source of ridicule and pain. Users can safely talk about tough issues affecting their personal lives in a manner they know will have limited social implications.
“You can discuss not only your relationships, but also issues as deep-reaching as depression or eating disorders,” Williams said. “Whatever you are going through, you can talk about that, and I feel like it can be very supportive for people.”
In a world dominated by social networks that often focus on the superficial, RIZZAR aims to offer a positive outlet for those going through struggles or who simply want to share their opinions. RIZZARR aptly fills a gap that Williams believes has been prevalent in social media for some time. There is a lack of inspiration, compassion and sensitivity in the social network space, and RIZZARR hopes to fill that hole she says.
In addition, RIZZARR has ambitions to provide a competitive marketing tool for companies trying to reach millenials through a new channel.
“We also want brands to use our platform to authentically engage with millennials and to inspire them in ways that can help them to lead better lives through using their products,” Williams said
Through Williams was inspired to start RIZZARR when she noticed an obvious hole in the social network world, it was her time at USC that equipped her with the skills and knowledge to start a business in the media sector.
In particular, Williams credits one of her journalism professors, Lincoln Bandlow, who served as an advisor for her throughout the process of building RIZZARR.
“My USC professors really helped me understand the legal implications of starting a business and being involved in the media,” Williams said. “Most importantly, they thoroughly ingrained the process of copyright issues and patents.”
During her time at USC, Williams was involved with several different campus organizations and held leadership positions in many, including Trojan Vision.
As of now, RIZZARR is going through its first round of seed funding, which in start-up terms means it is looking for investors from different venture capital firms, as well as angel donors, some of which may be from the Trojan family, Williams said.
Currently RIZZARR has 1,000 monthly active users, and while it is clear by the design of the website that it is still in its early stages, this new website holds promise for a new constructive social media outlet. Potential new users can visit RIZZARR at rizzarr.com.

The USC women’s basketball team will look to get back on the right track, as they return to the Galen Center to take on Utah on Friday, Feb. 6 at 7 p.m. and Colorado on Sunday, Feb. 8 at 12 p.m.
The Women of Troy (11-10, 3-7 Pac-12) are currently on a five-game losing streak, their longest streak since an eight-game one in the 2012-2013 season.
They suffered a 68-35 loss to No. 7 Oregon State (20-1, 10-0 Pac-12), and then a 63-57 loss to Oregon (10-11, 3-7 Pac-12) last weekend.
USC held a 25-23 lead at halftime against the Ducks, but a strong shooting effort by Oregon allowed the Ducks to pull ahead.
Senior forward Kaneisha Horn led USC with a total of 21 points, including a team-leading 10 against the Beavers, and 13 rebounds over the weekend.  Sophomore guard Courtney Jaco scored 14 points against the Ducks, while senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama finished with 10 points.
“We don’t come out with enough intensity to compete,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said.
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama leads the Women of Troy with 12.2 points to go along with 6.7 rebounds per game.
Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert is scoring 10.4 points per game, while junior guard Brianna Barrett is adding 10.2 points. She leads the team with just under four assists per game.
“We just need to work harder, everybody needs to take a step back, look themselves in the mirror and see what they can do to contribute to this team’s success,” sophomore guard Courtney Jaco said.
Taryn Wicijowski leads Utah (7-14, 1-9 Pac-12) with 14.8 points and 9.6 rebounds per game. Tanaeya Boclair has 9.7 points per game.
The Utes have lost nine of their last 10 games, with their only win coming last Friday, beating Arizona 62-48.
Colorado (10-11, 3-7 Pac-12) has four players averaging double-digits in scoring, led by Jen Reese’s 13.7 points per game and Jamee Swan’s 13.5 points per game. Swan and Reese also lead the Buffaloes in rebounding, with 7.8 and 7.3 rebounds per game respectively. Colorado is coming off a 68-60 loss to Arizona State and an 81-69 win over the Wildcats. The Buffaloes are 3-8 in their last 11 games after starting the season 7-3.
“I think we have to believe that we can win,” sophomore guard Jordan Adams said. “It’s kind of defeating when you’re losing all the time, and you feel like you’re not good, you have doubts about yourself.
USC has beaten both the Buffaloes and Utes this season, picking up an 81-61 win over Colorado behind 20 points apiece from Barrett and Vaioletama and a 46-43 win over Utah. Barrett was the only double-digit scorer against the Utes, picking up 13 points.
“I think the team needs to believe that we are good and we have the capability of winning,” Adams said. “We just have to come into practice like we want to win, and we have to come into practice like we want to get better.”
The Women of Troy are 8-5 all-time against Utah and 7-4 against Colorado, and they swept both squads last season.
“They did a really good job of playing defense on us,” Jaco said about the last match against the Utes. “They [play] a sagging type, and we’re not the most frequent shooting team, but I think if we get out in transition, play our game, play fast, we’ll be okay and we’ll score a couple more baskets.”
USC will head up to Northern California to take on Stanford (17-5, 9-1 Pac-12) on Friday,      Feb. 13 at 6 p.m. in Palo Alto, followed by a match against California (16-5, 8-2 Pac-12) on Sunday,    Feb. 15 at 6:30 p.m. in Berkeley.
They will then return to the Galen Center for their final two home games of the season: Arizona (8-13, 1-9 Pac-12) on Friday, Feb. 20 at 7 p.m. and Arizona State (20-2, 9-1 Pac-12) on Sunday, Feb. 22 at 3 p.m.

On Saturday, the USC women’s lacrosse team will kick off its 2015 season in style at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Looking to build upon a 2014 campaign in which they finished 6-3 in MPSF conference play and 9-9 overall, the Women of Troy are hoping to find and maintain a high level of consistency throughout their performances this season, an objective that has understandably been tough at times for a program entering just its third year of existence.
“Last season we had some really exciting games, like when we upset No. 13 Stanford, but also some games where we were disappointed with the outcome,” senior captain and midfielder Kaila Sommi said. “We weren’t as consistent as we would have liked to be, and so this year, we hope to improve that.”
A main factor in the team’s  up-and-down play over the past two seasons can probably be attributed to the plethora of young players that filled the roster, as there were only two total recruiting classes in team history. As the inaugural 2013 recruiting class progresses into their third season donning the cardinal and gold, however, the team finds itself in an unfamiliar position: For the first time, the Women of Troy will have more upperclassmen than underclassmen. Twenty-one of the 36 listed members on the team’s online roster hold junior or senior class standings. The leadership, maturity and experience provided by these older members is already paying dividends so far this year.
“Being in our third season, we finally feel like we have been together as a team for a while,” junior captain and defender Courtney Tarleton said. “The first two seasons we had huge freshman classes, but this year we only have four new freshmen, so there haven’t been nearly as many new faces that we have to get used to playing with.”
This heightened familiarity should prove to be  a positive factor in the team’s success this year, and if the preseason is any indication, the Women of Troy are headed for an exciting third season under accomplished head coach Lindsey Munday.
“Year three has been great so far,” Munday said. “It is not only on the field, it is also off the field. It’s been awesome to watch, and we are really excited about the direction this team is heading.”
Munday emphasized that there has been a noticeable leadership presence among the now-majority upperclassmen, something that has accelerated the team’s cohesion and confidence so far this year.
“Our junior and senior classes have really stepped up so far,” she said. “I’m beyond proud of them in terms of how they are taking ownership of this program and living out the ideas and philosophies that we preach as a coaching staff.”
Among those upperclassmen is standout junior attacker Caroline de Lyra, who led the team in points scored last season with 49, as well as junior midfielder Amanda Johansen and junior defender Tarleton, both of whom started all 18 games for the Women of Troy last season. The senior class features midfielder/defender Kaitlyn Couture, midfielder Sommi and defender Elizabeth Eddy. The underclassmen feature potential impact freshmen in 2014 Under Armour All-American goalie Gussie Johns and midfielder Lydia Sutton, who played for the 2013 Canadian national lacrosse team. The returning sophomore class for the Women of Troy features great talent as well, led by a duo of attackers in Annie Ruland, who was third on the team in points (36) last season, and Michaela Michael, who finished fourth in points with 31, and defender Nina Kelty, who was named to the MPSF All-Conference Second Team as a freshman last year. The standout sophomore class lost a key member from last year’s team in attacker Alex Moore, who led the team with 35 goals and was second on the team with 46 total points as a freshman. She transferred to North Carolina this past summer.
With the upperclassmen leading the way, the Women of Troy have been working tirelessly during the preseason in preparation. While the copious hours of training and practice that the team has put in so far have been mentally and physically taxing at times, both the players and coaches alike are already seeing some payoffs.
“Every day in practice is such a battle going back and forth with our offense and defense,” Tarleton said. “I’m already seeing improvement from last season.”
Munday, along with assistant coaches Devon Wills, the defensive coordinator, and Alyssa Leonard, the offensive coordinator, heads what comprises one of the more idiosyncratic coaching staffs in the country: All three coaches are still active as players, and at the highest level too, representing the United States on the women’s national team. Having an opportunity to learn from three coaches with such rich playing experiences — and particularly, three coaches who are still playing — provides a distinctive and unique experience for the players.
“It’s awesome having coaches who play for Team USA,” Tarleton said. “Sometimes they will just jump into practice and start chasing us around the field. It is great to both have them coach us and play against us, because they are so talented and help us get better.”
“You know they know what they are talking about,” Sommi said. “You trust them because you know they are the best in the world at the moment, which really brings a lot of weight to what they say.”
With the rigorous last month of workouts wrapping up, the team will have its first opportunity to evaluate its preseason progress this Saturday against perennial powerhouse Northwestern. The Wildcats, who are ranked No. 5 in the IWLCA preseason poll, have made 10 straight trips to the NCAA semifinals, winning championships in seven of those trips and losing to the eventual national champion in the other three.
The game is sure to be exciting for the entire USC team. It will be especially meaningful for Munday and Leonard, however, who are both Northwestern graduates and contributed to the Wildcats’ remarkable run of success over the last decade. Munday (class of 2006) was a two-time first-team All-American who helped lead Northwestern to back-to-back titles in 2005 and 2006 and left the school as the Wildcats’ all-time assist leader (128), third-best points scorer (268) and fifth-best goal scorer (140). Leonard, who just graduated last year, exited Northwestern as the all-time NCAA Division I career draw control leader, a two-time national champion (2011, 2012) and a 2014 IWLCA            All-American.
When asked about her excitement level for Saturday’s game, Munday acknowledged that she and Leonard are looking forward to it, but that the best thing about the weekend matchup is that it will be a great opportunity for the Women of Troy to see how they measure up against premier competition.
“This first game against Northwestern is definitely special for both Alyssa and me,” Munday said. “It’s a special game for us, being alumni, but more importantly this is a big game for our girls, getting to play against a top team.”
The tilt between the Women of Troy and Wildcats will launch into action at 3 p.m.

Like most of you reading this column, I spent my last Sunday afternoon watching the Seattle Seahawks take on the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX.
Even though I had no allegiance to either team, I am a die-hard Raiders fan, so I thoroughly enjoy watching the Patriots lose — damn you, tuck rule. While the ending was not in my favor, once again because of a questionable Pete Carroll decision, the game was a massive hit.
The Patriots and Seahawks played one of the greatest Super Bowls since the Giants beat the Pats back in 2008. Over 114 million people watched the game, making it the most viewed television show in American history. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady cemented his status as a first-ballot Hall of Famer, Pete Carroll’s decision will be questioned for the next eight months, and a certain shark will go down in infamy.
The NFL was sitting pretty once again. Roger Goodell should be sitting in his office full of giddiness, right? After all, he is the commissioner of the most popular professional sports league in America. One would figure he has no problems, right?
Wrong. While the NFL has been a huge hit on the field, the league has a huge problem when it comes to the off-the-field conduct of its players. On top of this, doctors are breathing down the NFL’s neck when it comes to concussions and brain injuries of its current and former players.
After I was finished being dazzled and amazed by the grand spectacle that is the Super Bowl, I ran across a picture on Twitter that really emphasized the NFL’s main problems.
In this satirical cartoon, two very worrisome officials, one of them presumably Roger Goodell, are carting off two deflated footballs connected to heart monitors and other medical equipment. In the background, there is one player beating his wife and another sitting on the floor with his helmet off, presumably suffering from a concussion.
To me, this encompassed everything that is wrong with the NFL right now. In the week leading up to the Super Bowl, there was so much coverage of whether or not the Patriots had deflated footballs during their 45-7 shellacking of the Indianapolis Colts. There was so much unnecessary media attention that I couldn’t even turn on ESPN.
It is what hasn’t been covered, however, or even really discussed by the NFL that is disturbing. This year alone, the NFL has seen two star running backs, Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, as well as Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy embroiled in domestic abuse cases. Except for a few games, all three players missed the 2014 season.
The NFL has had a long history with off-field issues involving its players.
According to a USA Today database, over 780 NFL players have been placed under arrest for various crimes, ranging from domestic abuse to drug possession, since 2000. In the past year, the NFL saw 60 of its players face criminal charges.
As a leader, Goodell is supposed to point his league in the right direction. He has done just the opposite, however. Over the summer, Goodell botched the Ray Rice decision, allowed Greg Hardy to play despite being found guilty of domestic abuse, and topped it off by creating a whole set of new domestic abuse rules only to break and bend them as he pleased.
What’s even more disturbing about the NFL and Goodell is their handling of concussions and other brain-related injuries to their former and current players. For years, doctors said that playing football was a direct cause of brain trauma, a claim the NFL shot down time and time again.
It wasn’t until 2014, almost 50 years after the modern league’s inception, that the NFL agreed one in three players will be affected by brain trauma. This admission came only after a study certified that 76 out of 79 deceased former NFL players, one of whom was former Trojan Junior Seau, suffered from a degenerative brain disease.
As shown by the success of the Super Bowl year in and year out, the NFL will undoubtedly not feel any ramifications from its mishandling of player safety and off-the-field issues any time soon.
The NFL is at the top of its game right now and shows no signs of slowing down. If the league hopes to maintain its advantage, however, it may want to put more effort into solving bigger problems than deflated footballs.

By themselves, guns and bombs will not defeat an ideology of terror, death and destruction. Education and understanding will.
The ideology I speak of recently shocked the world in a 22-minute video. The video shows the brutal execution of a Jordanian fighter pilot, Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh. When al-Kaseasbeh’s fighter plane crashed in Syria in late December, he was captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Prisoner swap negotiations between the Jordanian government and ISIS failed.
As Al-Kaseasbeh writhes and audibly screams for nearly a minute in the video while his body is burned alive, the world seems like a scarier place than ever. The terror wreaked by the Islamic State is so unsettling because they aren’t a nation state, either; their territorial reach extends from Northern Iraq to Southern Syria, but they have tens of thousands of followers around the world, all preaching a radical, hate-filled doctrine.
To be clear, the religion of Islam is not that doctrine. Islam is a religion of one and a half billion people, and as scholar Reza Aslan has argued, Islam — like any other religion — is characterized by what its followers bring to it. The majority of Muslims, just like the majority of Christians, Jews, Sikhs, etc., do not bring violent extremism to their religion.
To respond to the continued brutality of ISIS with Islamaphobia and logically devoid generalizations about the Muslim faith would be an enormous error. It would be an error that forgets, for example, that  the occupants of a Muslim prayer room on the 17th floor of the World Trade Center’s South Tower were among the thousands killed on 9/11. They were killed peacefully practicing a faith that shares its basic tenets of compassion and self-betterment with nearly every other religion.
Such an error would also selectively forget the actions of Christian extremists — the Crusades or Spanish Inquisition being the most obvious — like Anders Breivik, who in July 2011 single-handedly massacred 77 people at a Norwegian youth camp. It was one of the worst terrorist attacks the world had seen since 9/11, but did the aftermath of that attack reveal deep seated hatred with the Christian faith? Of course not.
The point is, and I’m modifying a phrase from gun-rights activists here: religion does not kill people. People do. In the same way that a grotesque minority of individuals have brought violence to an ordinarily peaceful religion, it is imperative for the world citizenry to bring hope and tolerance to the forefront of their fight against those individuals.
The global citizenry needs hope that in the face of such horror, peace will prevail. The world’s apathetic people (and there are plenty in the United States) must redouble their efforts to participate in the free exchange of ideas, on the Internet and elsewhere, because their voice is needed, now more than ever. Steady support of coalition governments engaging in military support against ISIS is a must, but so, too, is steady and unwavering pressure on the leaders of those governments to continue to offer a competing vision of global togetherness in the marketplace of ideas.
Society needs tolerance to stem the tide of overreaction. This begins with recognizing the distinction between the ideology of individuals and the teachings of religion. Overgeneralizing the message of ISIS to a much broader group of Muslims only increases the risk that, in response to that overgeneralizing, ISIS’s recruiting and ranks will grow. Instead of this mistake, tolerance and support of individuals who share nothing in common with ISIS but a peaceful religious faith will ensure that the radicalized ideas of ISIS will die in the marketplace of ideas.
The Jordanian government responded to the burning by executing two Al Qaeda-affiliated prisoners who were captured several years ago. ISIS demanded one of the prisoners, Sajida al-Rishawi, who had been on death row for an attempted suicide bombing, be released in exchange for al-Kaseasbeh. Jordan’s retaliation by execution plays the same sad game that ISIS thrives upon. To demonstrate the anti-ISIS message that world leaders so desperately need to communicate, what if Jordan had simply let al-Rishawi go free anyways?
That would have sent a powerful message: “We know you hate us, and we will relentlessly condemn your actions with military and ideological force—but unlike you, we are above terror for terror’s sake.”

The Muslim Game:
Bringing  other religions down to the level of Islam is one of the most popular strategies  of Muslim apologists when confronted  with the spectacle of Islamic violence.  Remember Timothy McVeigh, the  Oklahoma City bomber?  How about Anders Breivik, the Norwegian killer?  Why pick on Islam if other religions have the same  problems? 
The Truth:
Because  they don’t.  
Regardless  of what his birth certificate may or may not have said, Timothy McVeigh was not  a religious man (in fact, he stated explicitly that he was agnostic and that “science” was his religion).  At no time did he credit his deeds to religion, quote  Bible verses, or claim that he killed for Jesus.  His motives are very well documented through  interviews and research.  God is never mentioned.
The  so-called “members of other faiths” alluded to by Muslims are nearly always just  nominal members who have no active involvement.  They are neither inspired  by, nor do they credit religion as Muslim terrorists do – and this is what makes  it a very different matter.  
Islam is  associated with Islamic terrorism because that is the association that the  terrorists themselves choose to make.
Muslims who  compare crime committed by people who happen to be nominal members of other  religions to religious terror committed explicitly in the name of Islam are  comparing apples to oranges.  
Yes, some  of the abortion clinic bombers were religious (as Muslims enjoy pointing out),  but consider the scope of the problem.  There have been six deadly attacks over  a  36 year period in the U.S.  Eight people died.  This is an average  of one death every 4.5 years.
By  contrast, Islamic terrorists staged nearly ten thousand deadly  attacks in just the six years following September 11th, 2001.  If one goes  back to 1971, when Muslim armies in Bangladesh began the mass slaughter of  Hindus, through the years of Jihad in the Sudan, Kashmir and Algeria, and the  present-day Sunni-Shia violence in Iraq, the number of innocents killed in the  name of Islam probably  exceeds five million over this same period.
Anders  Breivik, who murdered 77 innocents in a lone rampage on July 22nd, 2011, was  originally misidentified as a “Christian fundamentalist” by the police.  In  fact, the killings were later determined to be politically motivated.  He  also left behind a detailed 1500 page manifesto in which he stated that he is  not religious, does not know if God exists, and prefers a secular state to a  theocracy.  Needless to say, he does not quote any Bible verses in support  of his killing spree, nor did he shout “praise the Lord” as he picked people  off.  
In the last  ten years, there have been perhaps a dozen or so religiously-inspired killings  by people of all other faiths combined.  No other religion  produces the killing sprees that  Islam does nearly every day of the year.  Neither do they have verses in their holy texts that arguably  support it.  Nor do they have large groups across the globe dedicated to the mass murder of people  who worship a different god, as the broader community of believers struggles  with ambivalence and tolerance for a radical clergy that supports the terror.
Muslims may  like to pretend that other religions are just as subject to “misinterpretation”  as is their “perfect” one, but the reality speaks of something far worse.
Nathan writes, “To be clear, the religion of Islam is not that doctrine. Islam is a religion of one and a half billion people, and as scholar Reza Aslan has argued, Islam — like any other religion — is characterized by what its followers bring to it.”
+++
Good God, quoting Reza Aslan to better understand Islam is like quoting Josef Goebbels to better understand Nazism.
Education and understanding? Would that have worked with the Nazis, too? C’mon, Nathaniel, we are not dealing with rational, reasonable people who have the desire to negotiate and talk. They don’t want to work things out. They are virulent fanatics who want to burn YOU alive if they get their hands on you. And if you are a Christian or Jew, unlike the fellow Muslim Jordanian they burned, perhaps they would find even more violent , long-lasting and painful torture for you. ISIS cannot all be psychopaths, buyt the psychopaths are in charge and their troops and financial backers find that acceptable. Forcibly convert you to an ISIS subject or enslave you if you are lucky, but murder you in hideous ways would be their choice. They are not like you, Nathaniel. Such people exist.

Hundreds of USC students and local activists gathered around Tommy Trojan last Thursday to rally for higher wages for USC workers. The rally, which took place just after the upload of a YouTube video that shows a USC worker confronting President C. L. Max Nikias about her wages, mobilized the local community around the issue of paying workers the wages they deserve.
Certainly, the issue is not limited to USC’s campus. In a long-awaited move, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti recently proposed increasing the minimum wage to $13.25 per hour by 2017, and others have proposed a hike to $15.25 per hour by 2019.
And yet, during negotiations between council members and labor unions in Los Angeles and between the UNITE HERE Local 11 union and USC administration, the economic lens of the minimum wage has overshadowed the human aspect of paying workers a living wage.
The personal aspect, then, explains precisely why the YouTube video, which has now garnered more than 7,000 views, has pulled on the heartstrings of so many. In the video, USC hospitality worker Abigail Lopez explains to an at-a-loss Nikias the difficulties of covering bills when making only $11 an hour.
Nikias’ reaction is on some level understandable — his reality is removed from that of earning $11 an hour. And it is so easy for policymakers and administrators to turn to macroeconomics to guide their wage choices — increasing wages from $11 to $15 an hour for every worker throughout the university surely poses a significant cost.
But if administrators like numbers so much, then perhaps they should look at the microeconomics — they should consider that the cost of living in Los Angeles is 40.9 percent greater than the national average. They should consider the cost of refusing to allow a consistent 40-hour work week. They should consider the loyalty of workers who have been serving at USC for 30 or 40 years and yet still receive $11 an hour. And as Los Angeles’ largest private employer, they should consider the thousands of workers’ lives they impact, and perhaps, as a rally saying goes, they should put people over profit.
USC’s refusal to pay workers a living wage seems particularly ironic when considering the family-oriented nature of the university.
“We talk about Trojan family all the time, but we don’t see that when we treat our workers with disrespect by paying them poverty wages,” said Chanelle Ya, a member of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation.
As a premier private academic institution, USC appeals to the masses because of its emphasis on personal relationships. Small class sizes prize individualized attention, remarkable advising services foster personal and professional growth, and a remarkably caring faculty ensures that each student receives the benefits of careful commitment. And yet, workers, though they are committed to working every day to improve the lives of students, are only lost among a sea of bureaucratic calculations and exempt from the Trojan family.
Wages are not purely an economic issue, and they should not only be discussed by those who wield the power to determine them. It is an intrinsic human right that workers’ wages allow them to feed their families. And it is the social responsibility of the university, as a global citizen wielding incredible influence, to set a precedent to pay its workers a decent wage.
Part of USC’s influence lies in its prestige as an academic institution that other institutions look up to, and part of it lies in the students that soak up the reputation and practices of USC itself. The thousands of young entrepreneurs and managers and future venture capitalists that now study here may very well run their own corporations one day, and they look to this institution for guidance. And if not for our sake, for theirs we cannot afford to perpetuate the cruel view of workers as just cogs in the machine.
It is at times easy to forget that though it may operate like a business, USC is a not-for-profit university. Perhaps it should start acting like one.
Who is going to pay for this wage increase?
At upwards of $50,000.00 per Student and $1,500.00 per bed I think USC can more then afford to pay all “Workers” a salary far above a living wage. University standards call for a 2.5% pay increase per year for all full time employees.  That being said we here at USC got a paltry .025% pay raise this year which equals a whopping .80/hour. Meanwhile, Faculty members got a 10% pay increase along with a per diem raise and a cost of living adjustment. Excuse me but my living costs increased over the past year and I don’t live on campus in apartments or dorms that are paid for by the University. And I still have to pay for my meals every day that aren’t covered by USC. Lucky for me I can almost buy an extra tank of gas to get to work per week.
I know the next statement and yes im grateful to have a job, but the point is how can a not for profit University which depends on people like us to keep this University running refuse to pay their employees a better then average salary. Shame on this President and the other clueless Administration suits to call for a 6% reduction of staff in all departments in this Presidents first year in office and then turn around and authorize spending 32 million dollars that we know of on the Presidents University residence at Mudd Estate while employees are needlessly thrown into the street like a piece of trash.
This article makes it sound as though every “worker” at USC makes $11/hour.

It took eight words to sell Breaking Bad: “We’re going to turn Mr. Chips into Scarface.”  It was half sales pitch, half declaration of intent, and with those words, Vince Gilligan launched the brilliant AMC original drama that went from under-watched critical darling to full-blown cultural phenomenon thanks to characters and storylines that proved nearly as addictive as the high-quality crystal meth manufactured by its antihero protagonists. From January 2008 to October 2013, millions of viewers tuned in to watch Walter White (Bryan Cranston) grow, decay and transform himself from a cancer-stricken high school chemistry teacher into the ruthless drug kingpin known as Heisenberg.
So, now that nearly a year and a half has passed since the strange and terrible saga of Mr. White reached its grimly satisfying conclusion, will the world Gilligan and his team spent five seasons carefully crafting simply fade away like a majestic Albuquerque sunset? Not if a certain criminal lawyer has anything to say about it.
Gilligan has reteamed with his creative partner Peter Gould to produce Better Call Saul, a prequel to Breaking Bad focusing on the hardscrabble salad days of Walter White’s attorney Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), the smooth-talking huckster whose lurid fashion sense (check stone suits, mint green shirts, lavender pocket squares) speaks louder than his conscience. The show, which has its two-night premiere this Sunday and Monday on AMC, reveals that Saul, also known as Jimmy McGill, was once an ambitious young legal eagle whose moral edges were eroded by the tribulations of time and circumstance.
Better Call Saul has already garnered a staggering amount of critical praise, with many comparing its first episodes favorably to those of its parent series, which were shot through with nerve-jangling suspense, technical bravura and bloody bursts of mordant humor. Such a warm reception bodes well for the longevity of the show, which was renewed for a second season months ahead of its premiere date.
Contrary to AMC’s jocular advertising campaign, this is a rich human drama peppered with elements of comedy, not the other way around. True, Jimmy isn’t yet grappling with the mortal terrors Walt and his tortured protégé Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) so often had to deal with, but he still has plenty on his plate, including a once-successful older brother (Michael McKean) laid low by agoraphobia, an unfairly gifted rival attorney (Patrick Fabian) and a former flame-turned-litigator (Rhea Seehorn), who worries their personal history could jeopardize her career prospects.
Perhaps the greatest asset Better Call Saul has going for it is Odenkirk himself. The actor, best known for co-creating HBO’s subversive sketch series Mr. Show with future Arrested Development star David Cross and kick-starting the careers of alternative comedy duo Tim and Eric, is a whip-smart whirlwind of charisma who made Saul an instant hit with the fans after appearing midway through the second season of Breaking Bad. Nearly everything about the character, from his strip mall law offices (perhaps intended as a homage to Phil Hartman’s Lionel Hutz character on The Simpsons) to his sleazy but sound methods of dispensing legal advice, seemed tailor-made for Odenkirk, and viewers couldn’t get enough of him, particularly after Saul became the primary source of comedy relief in the show’s later, considerably darker seasons.
Better Call Saul also has a distinct advantage over other new series, one typically reserved for shows featuring superheroes: the benefit of a pre-established universe. Gilligan and Gould’s new story takes place roughly six years before the events of Breaking Bad, meaning there’s a deep roster of characters and plotlines to draw from if need be. Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), the Colonel Sanders of contraband, is still alive in this timeline, as are the psychotic Tuco (Raymond Cruz) and his bell-ringing uncle Hector (Mark Margolis). Who knows, we may even run into Walt and Jesse at some point.
It would, however, be a mistake for the show to lean too heavily on arbitrary fan service, however. Gilligan and Gould, to their credit, have both shot down rumors of a Walt or Jesse cameo for this season. This series is an entirely new beast, after all, and the characters who inhabit it deserve their time to shine.
In fact, the only connective tissue Better Call Saul currently shares with Breaking Bad aside from the setting and Saul himself is the crotchety presence of Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), the underworld fixer with the permanent scowl who appears to be working as a parking garage attendant in the premiere episode. Mike, like Saul, was one of the acting highlights of Breaking Bad’s initial run, and it will be a kick to see Banks back in action as the geriatric bruiser with the hidebound soul of a samurai.
So, what does the future hold for Better Call Saul? Spin-offs, even the really good ones, are never a sure thing. For every Frasier and Mork and Mindy, there’s a Joey. Gilligan knows this better than most, having masterminded the short-lived X-Files offshoot The Lone Gunmen back in 2001. For now, though, the possibilities for Saul remain endless. In a year that will see audiences travel back to Jurassic Park, Avengers Tower and even A Galaxy Far, Far Away, it’s nothing short of remarkable that a return trip to Albuquerque is likely to be the most entertaining of the bunch.

Snapchat is one of those things that really didn’t have to come into existence, but once it did, it immediately gained a following of users who can’t even fathom how they would’ve gone about their day without it. It’s that way with a lot of things in today’s social media world. Take Facebook, for instance. Isn’t it strange to think that a college student’s homework assignment can shape the way our generation communicates? But it just keeps happening.
Maybe it’s because social media agencies understand just how we like our communication: concise and clear. We want a visual with some text on the side, and a smorgasbord of emojis to express our nuanced emotional states. It’s true that Snapchat propagates the trend of visual communication, but the trend existed before the apps. Just take one look at our advertisements — many of them don’t even have words on them anymore, as opposed to the 1950s Marlboro ads where there would be paragraphs of introduction. So what does that mean — are we regressing as a society because we prefer images over words?
They say, a picture is worth a thousand words. But can a picture really replace words? Or a better question is, should it? I’ve heard many complaints (mostly from English teachers) about how the written word is losing its status in today’s society.
It’s true that we are condensing language with flurries of contractions, abbreviations, and acronyms, but at the same time, we use language now more than ever. Instead of exchanging a letter a week, we exchange hundreds of texts a day. We skillfully learn to match images with the perfect caption. It seems to me that we’ve transformed the concept of communication into one that includes both visual language and written language. Instead of seeing it as the death of the written word, maybe it’s time to see it as the birth of a new partnership.

I have to admit that in my choice of study abroad destinations, I chose a country relatively similar to the United States. The United Kingdom shares not only a language with America, but many other qualities. But this, I think, just makes the subtler differences stand out more sharply in contrast than in a place where the cultures are dramatically disparate. Here are just a couple of things I’ve noticed in my first two weeks studying abroad in London.
Spending hours at a restaurant. In America, everything is fast-paced. As London is a large and bustling city, a lot of things are here, too. During rush hour, it’s not unusual to see people speed walking through the city on their way to work. Eating at a restaurant, however, is quite different. It’s expected for people to linger over their meal, and even once the food is finished, the bill does not appear immediately — or sometimes at all, until you specifically request it. If I were to be in a rush, it might be kind of annoying, but it’s been nice to learn to enjoy food and company and not feel in a hurry to be on to the next thing.
Enjoying an afternoon in a cafe. The same philosophy that applies to eating out applies to afternoon tea and coffee in England. In addition to the full on high tea, just normal coffee shops such as Starbucks or Europe’s version, Caffe Nero, all have comfortable seating where patrons linger over afternoon drinks served in ceramic mugs rather than to-go (or should I say “takeaway”) cups.
Talking on public transport. In London, if you want to be spotted as a tourist, a sure way to do so is to speak loudly on the Tube or a bus. During rush hour, despite how crowded the train might be, it is just about silent besides the whooshing sounds of the subway traversing the city underground. If you do dare to speak, expect to get some disapproving looks from the locals. Apparently, public transport is quiet time.

If you’re craving a sweet fix and are willing to make the trip to West L.A., while you’re at it, perhaps Atticus Creamery & Pies should be a new addition to your day trip bucket list. The little dessert spot, located on Westwood and Pico – across the street from the Westside Pavillion – specializes in serving up handcrafted small pies and ice cream, which are made fresh in small batches daily.
With pie flavors like Lemon Lavender or Earl Grey, Atticus isn’t the place to go for your classic American pies. Though you’re bound to find ingredients like apple, cherry and pumpkin, it’s best to go on a day that you’re feeling a little daring.

How about Sweet Corn ice cream? Nutella Ferrero Rocher? The dessert shop prides itself on providing flavors that tease and challenge your taste buds: ones that are unlikely and refreshing, but also pleasantly comfortable. According to their website, their mission is for you to try something new but have that thing be something you can enjoy over and over again, in celebration, during a breakup–or just a hot day.
If you’re still wondering about the Sweet Corn ice cream, it’s a great alternative to vanilla that’s slightly less rich but still very sweet. Corn is sweet by itself, even when it’s complementing a sweet treat. A favorite flavor in Mexico, where kernels are actually stirred in whole, corn produces a sweet milky extract that is added to an ice cream’s custard base. Though it isn’t a widely popular flavor in most ice cream shops in this country, it makes appearances in artisanal creameries that are scattered across our favorite towns and cities.
Though Atticus manages to serve up a daily dose of charming pies and inventive ice creams, in order to survive as a sweet shop these days, it’s important as a business to possess charm that goes beyond the desserts. With the coziness of a handwritten menu, neutral-toned walls, and subtle rustic touches, its approach to food transfers over to its décor as well. The shop has a clean, brightly lit, modern look that’s characteristic of many recent Los Angeles cafes, yet still manages to be inviting and warm. Dark wooden shelves adorned with the winsome flower or old-time alarm clock keep the vibes low-key and comfortable, striking a balance between efficiently modern and an unwinding cool – a balance that is difficult to come by.
Atticus is open from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday and Sunday, and 12 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday.
