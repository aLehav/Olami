Over the weekend, the women’s volleyball championship tipped off with the first and second round games. The Women of Troy finished with a 22-9 record and a 14-6 conference record. They began the tournament as the 10th seed and were pitted against Southland Conference champion Central Arkansas (27-4, 13-3 Southland Conference) in the opening round on Friday at Galen Center.
The first set was a tough but entertaining back and forth affair as neither team could seize control of the game early on but the Sugar Bears increasingly ramped up their intensity and took a 14-12 lead on a 5-0 run. The Bears then extended their lead to 19-15 but the Trojans rallied back to tie it at 21 apiece. However, the Sugar Bears powered past the Trojans 25-22 in the first set using a 4-1 run to break the tie as Savanah Allen of the Sugar Bears struck for two crucial kills to push the Bears’ lead. 
The second set was even closer as the set saw 12 tied scores and four lead changes between the two squads. Despite taking an early 11-7 lead, the Sugar Bears could not hold onto the lead as the Trojans answered with a 8-2 run. After several back and forth possessions, the two teams were tied again at 20 all. Brittany Abercrombie, who was named to the Pac-12 All-Conference team, pushed the USC lead up 22-20 on back to back kills but the Sugar Bears retook the lead 23-22 following successful strikes. However, the Trojans would tie it at 23 on another Lanier kill and consecutive Sugar Bear errors sealed a hard-fought second set for the Trojans, 25-23. Khalia Lanier, who was also named to the Pac-12 All-Conference team, had 16 kills on a .323 hitting percentage by the end of the 2nd set. 
The 3rd set began similarly to the first two sets: no team could take control with several tied scores early on. But the Trojans were finally able to control the game as they led 15-11 which later extended to 20-12 on successful offensive attacks on the hapless Sugar Bears’ defense. Trojans’ errors contributed to a 6-1 Sugar Bears run which cut the lead to just 21-18 but the Trojans answer with a 4-0 run capped off by another Lanier kill to take the 3rd set 25-18, giving USC a 2-1 set advantage entering the 4th set. 
In the fourth set, the Trojans would take an early 6-3 lead but could never shake off the Sugar Bears who kept the deficit at 3 in the early going. With only a 3-point lead at just 11-8, the Trojans would go on a momentum draining 7-0 run with Jenna Adams serving two aces coupled with five consecutive Sugar Bears turnovers. With an 18-8 lead, the Trojans never looked back as they finished off the Sugar Bears 25-12 to take the fourth set and the game 3-1. 
“It’s always nice to get that first win,” head coach Mick Haley said. “You get amped up to play in this game. You’ve worked all season, and then you’re jumping higher than you’ve jumped all year; you’re going faster and your motor is running. We couldn’t really get into rhythm until the middle of the season set. When we finally calmed down a little bit, it was still touch and go for some time. We were very fortunate to get that second set and then we relaxed and played our game.”
Pac-12 All-Conference player Khalia Lanier led the way for the Women of Troy with 24 kills on .320 hitting percentage while fellow Pac-12 All-Conference teammate Brittany Abercrombie recorded 14 kills on .273 hitting percentage. Pac-12 All-Conference Honorable Mention Niki Withers and freshman Brooke Botkin combined for 19 kills. Setter Reni Meyer-Whalley recorded a double double of 26 assists and 11 digs while fellow setter Cindy Marina also recorded 26 assists along with four service aces. As a team, the Trojans combined for 62 kills on .307 hitting percentage while recording 60 assists, 56 digs, 10 block assists and 12 service aces in the win.
The Sugar Bears were led by Savanah Allen and Megan Nash with 12 kills each. The rest of the team had 26 kills combined while Elizabeth Armstrong recorded a game-high 41 assists. The Sugar Bears recorded 50 kills total on a .226 hitting percentage while recording 47 assists, 51 digs, six block assists and four block solos. Central Arkansas fought hard throughout the game, keeping the game close and within reach in the first three sets, but a sloppy fourth set which saw nine kills and nine errors seal the season for the Sugar Bears. 
“That’s a very good team,” Haley said. “They do what they do very well and they’re taught very well by a very good coach. I have a real appreciation for the way that they played. I thought they really gave us a good match.” 
With the win, the Trojans record their 23rd win of the season and advance to the second round to play the San Diego Toreros, who edged out Louisiana State 3-1 in an entertaining four set game. The Sugar Bears’ season comes to a close with the loss which puts them at 27-5 on the season as they are eliminated from the tournament.

The 10th-seeded Women of Troy advanced to the third round of the NCAA tournament after a win over San Diego on Saturday.
San Diego edged out the Louisiana State Tigers in a 3-1 win at Galen Center to advance to the second round and recorded their 25th win in the process. The Toreros are 25-4 on the season including an impressive 17-1 in the West Coast Conference play and was ranked No. 9 on the AVCA coaches rankings. The Trojans were No. 14 on the latest AVCA rankings.
In the first set, the Trojans jumped out and continually maintained a small lead over the Toreros for most of the game. While the Toreros kept close with the Trojans, the Toreros could never take the lead against the Trojans. The Toreros committed several mishaps that contributed to a 4-1 Trojans run to take a 18-15 lead, forcing a timeout. The Toreros would storm back to tie it at 22-22 behind Addie Picha’s scoring efforts but Niki Withers would help the Trojans close out the Toreros in the 1st set 25-22. The Toreros recorded nine errors in the first set alone which helped the Trojans tremendously in taking the 1st set.
The second set began with another fiercely competitive start as both teams fought to an 8-8 tie early on. The Trojans would however, take a 5-point lead on a 10-5 run which put the Trojans ahead 18-13 and seemingly in control of the second set. However, the Trojans committed consecutive errors which helped the Toreros tie the game at 18-all. The Trojans and the Toreros would trade point for point until they were tied at 24-24. The Toreros quickly seized advantage with a Roxie Wiblin kill to lead 25-24 before Trojans net error lifted the Toreros to a 26-24 set win. The Toreros only hit .108 in the 2nd set and had eight errors while the Trojans hit .103 and recorded nine errors.
In the crucial third set, the Toreros came out on fire as they took control with a 9-3 early lead which was later extended to 11-3, forcing a USC timeout. The Trojans responded with a 7-3 run of their own to cut into the deficit and force a San Diego timeout. The Trojans kept close with the Toreros throughout the rest of the set as they trailed 20-22 at one point before tying it up at 22 apiece on a Brittany Abercrombie kill. Both teams would later fight to a 24-24 tie but Jayden Kennedy of the Toreros broke the tie with a kill to help the Toreros take a 25-24 advantage. On the next possession, the Trojans commit a service error which gave the Toreros a 26-24 3rd set win and a 2-1 lead, putting the Trojans on the brink of elimination.  
The Toreros opened the fourth set carrying the game momentum and surged to an early 5-2 lead but the Trojans tied it up at 8. The fourth set remained heavily contested with neither team gaining control but the Toreros would hold a small 12-10 lead. The Trojans would go on a 7-3 run to take the lead over the Toreros 17-15 behind a balanced effort but the Toreros would answer with a quick 4-1 run to retake the lead at 19-18 and force a USC timeout. However the Trojans would grind out a 6-2 run to take a convincing 24-21 lead on consecutive kills and 2 crucial Toreros errors. While the Toreros cut it to 22-24, an attacking error by the Toreros gave the Trojans a 25-22 4th set win, tying the game up at two sets apiece. 
In the fifth and final set, the teams opened with a 2-2 tie but the Toreros would take a brief 5-3 lead. Lanier and Withers helped the Trojans tie it at 5-5 behind a kill and a successful defensive stop. The Trojans would later tie the game again at 7 before Reni Meyer-Whalley helped guide the Trojans to a 9-7 lead with a service ace and assist. The Toreros would storm back to take a 10-9 lead on a short 3-0 run, forcing another USC timeout. Down one and close to elimination, the Trojans sprung to life as Jordan Dunn and Brittany Abercrombie both spiked it home for 2 kills and a Dunn block leads to an attack error, giving the Trojans a 12-10 lead and forcing a San Diego timeout. The Toreros would cut into the lead with a kill but with firm momentum on the Trojans side, the Toreros were unable to defend against a Lanier kill and an Abercrombie kill, giving the Trojans a 14-11 lead and putting the Toreros on the brink of elimination. In the final possession, the Toreros spiked it out of bounds, giving the Trojans a 15-11 5th set victory and a 3-2 game win to advance to the regional semifinals.
“This is a great win for us because we’re continuing to grow and get better,” head coach Mick Haley said. “All the things that we’ve had happen to us during the season happened to us again during set two and three. No one knew who would win set four until right at the end and we started making the right decisions down the stretch and executed the right way. I was really impressed in set five. We had 11 kills on 18 attempts with only two errors. Even though we had some errors, we still came out on top. This is one that can really spring us for the regionals. We really need to know that we can do this and come back from deficits under pressure. It was nice doing it at home. Now, we’ll see if we can do it on the road.”
In the hard-fought win, the Trojans were once again led by Khalia Lanier with 23 kills on .259 hitting percentage, Niki Withers with 14 kills on .194 hitting percentage and Brittany Abercrombie on .194 hitting percentage. Jordan Dunn lifted the team on both the offensive and the defensive side, contributing 7 kills on .583 and recorded two block solos and eight block assists. Reni Meyer-Whalley recorded another double double with 32 assists and 14 digs while Cindy Marina recorded 19 assists and nine digs. Victoria Garrick had nine assists and 14 digs and was very effective all night on defense. The Trojans as a team had 65 kills on .218, 28 errors, 62 assists, 62 digs, 22 block assists and two block solos. The Trojans were extremely impressive in the fifth set, going for 11 kills on 18 attempts while committing two errors for a .500 hitting percentage.
The Toreros were led by Jayden Kennedy with 16 kills on .204 hitting percentage while Addie Picha, Lauren Fuller, Kaity Edwards each recorded 12 kills. Kristen Gengenbacher had a double double of 51 assists and 19 digs, both of which were the game-highs. As a team, the Toreros had 61 kills on .136, 60 assists, 66 digs, 24 block assists and 2 block solos. However, the team committed 37 errors, including 11 alone in the 4th set, which helped the Trojans. 
“[Jayden Kennedy] on the right side is a really fine player,” Haley said. “We were finally able to close her down after a very effective first and second sets. Then, they started going to their middles and the left side, and we had to figure out how to get that under control. Throughout the whole match, I felt our serving was consistently strong and aggressive. I think that’s what eventually wore down [Central Arkansas] yesterday and helped us wear down USD today. I was glad that the committee recognized us with the 10th seed, which I think we were both pretty equal coming in. You look at today’s match and you can see just how back-and-forth it was. Their setter was really good and they certainly did a lot of really nice things, but all-in-all, I think we had more firepower.”
With a hard-fought win over San Diego, who are now eliminated, the 24-9 Women of Troy will now move on to the regional semifinals to play the 7th-seeded (No. 8 on AVCA rankings) Minnesota Golden Gophers (28-5, 15-5 Big Ten Conference) in Gainesville, Florida on Friday. Minnesota overwhelmed North Dakota 3-0 in the first round before taking down Northern Iowa 3-1 to advance to the regional semifinals.
