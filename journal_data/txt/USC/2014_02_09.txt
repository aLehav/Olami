The Gould School of Law kicked off its new fundraising initiative with a gala at the Vibiana in Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday night. More than 200 USC faculty members, administrators, student leaders and alumni attended the event.
The initiative’s goal of $150 million is part of the Campaign for the University of Southern California, an effort by the university to raise $6 billion in private funding by 2018.
The funds will not only be used to provide scholarships to students and improve Gould’s facilities, but also to attract new faculty to the school.
“Faculty depend on the support of our alumni and supporters for endowed chairs, endowed professorships, for research funds,” said Elizabeth Garrett, provost and senior vice president of Academic Affairs.
Kenneth Doran, chair of the Gould Board of Councilors, emphasized the need for constant improvement in order for Gould to maintain its standing as a leader in legal education.
“We need the best facilities, the best students and the best faculty in order to not only maintain what we have, which is truly special, but to become an even better university, an even better law school for the future,” Doran said.
The initiative relies on graduates giving back to their alma mater.
Jackie Lacey, Los Angeles County district  attorney and a Gould alumna, noted her appreciation for the Trojan family in her keynote speech.
“My experience at Gould was         life-altering and has been the foundation for my career and for the life I have now,” she said.
Lauren Delilly, a third-year law student at Gould, was proud that alumni were interested in her goals.
“Having somebody invest in my future means that there’s people who recognize the quality of the education here at USC … that [Gould students] are worth investing in,” Delilly said.

This past weekend, Project: Possibility, together with the on-campus Association for Computing Machinery, hosted the “SS12 Hackathon: Code for a Cause.”

During the hackathon, undergraduates and graduates developed software projects for disabled persons.
Project: Possibility, a national nonprofit organization, creates software for persons with disabilities. The ACM, a worldwide computing society, serves the computing professional field’s library and research resources. The SS12 raises awareness about issues in accessible computing.
A hackathon does not mean hacking a system — it’s creating something people can use. In the course of a weekend, students can learn a semester’s worth of programming.
“This hackathon, I’m looking forward to helping out my teammates in how to code,” said Ryan Choi, a junior majoring in chemical engineering and nanotechnology. “I’ve learned how to do a lot and I’m looking forward to sharing that experience.”
Wilson Yeh, a freshman majoring in computer science, was excited to be able to give back through his participating in the hackathon.
“It feels really good when everything runs fine and you can say, ‘I made this,’” Yeh said.
SS12 has been held both at USC and at the University of California, Los Angeles through Project: Possibility and the universities’ local organizations, including ACM. In the past, competition winners have created works such as a Braille keyboard for mobile devices and voice-operated chess, according to the SS12.
The hackathon began Friday with a kickoff and introduction. Hackathon participants were allowed 48 hours to create a viable product.
Over the weekend, students worked in Leavey Library, Taper Hall and Grace Ford Salvatori Hall. With breaks only for meals, students coded from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. on Saturday. Some worked through the night up until Sunday afternoon. On Sunday, the students presented projects to judges at 6 p.m. in eight-minute demonstrations.
Students in one group programmed what happens on each screen of an Android application that allows the visually impaired to play Battleship. They tried to accommodate for unexpected errors in their design, emphasizing large buttons, motion sensor movements and automatic voice response.
“We created a small benefit,” Choi said. “There are not a lot of gaming options for visually impaired people. Most games involve or require visually responsive actions. We’re creating another avenue for gamers.”
Another group created an application for the elderly that detects when a person falls. The projects were geared toward making existing software accessible.
The SS12 empowered students to make a difference through developing software technology.
“[The hackathon competition] makes us realize that when you learn to code, there’s more to it than just technical details,” said Douglass Chen, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science. “You have to put yourselves in their shoes and think about how it changes their lives. There’s a lot of human connection when you do these kinds of contests.”
ACM awarded several prizes including Logitech software, an LG television screen, a Scrabble board game, a Comfort Curve 3000 keyboard and other miscellaneous items. USC’s winning team will take a trip to the San Diego Annual International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference to compete in the United States SS12 Finals with teams from  UCLA and California State University, Northridge.
In the future, ACM president Christina Chu hopes to get more beginner programmers to participate in the hackathon.
“We really want to encourage [the hackathon] for newbies and beginners, it may seem really intimidating [at first], to sit down and actually try it, that’s what we’re trying to get people to do,” Chu said.

USC hosted the 26th annual USC Libraries Scripter Award Saturday at Doheny Memorial Library.

The Scripter Award, founded in 1988, is bestowed by the Friends of the USC Libraries and honors the authors and screenwriters of the year’s motion pictures that were adapted from a printed work. The nominees for this year’s Scripter Award were the authors and screenwriters of 12 Years A Slave, Captain Phillips (from the book A Captain’s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea), Philomena (adapted from The Lost Child of Philomena Lee), The Spectacular Now and What Maisie Knew.
This year’s Scripter Award ceremony, which included a silent auction and three-course meal, focused on raising donations for the renovations of Leavey Library. Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries, said that libraries are necessary to the intellectual and creative life of students.
“The stories of the writers, artists and thinkers themselves — the detail of their lives, of their developments and observances — speak to the audience of young scholars and artists for inspiration, guidance and models to follow,” Quinlan said.
Jack Epps, member of the selection committee and associate professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, said that it’s wonderful to see the spotlight on screenwriters, which doesn’t happen very often.
“It’s also a wonderful marriage of books and films,” Epps said. “The two mediums are put together so well and drive you to each other. A great movie drives you to the novel, and a great novel drives you to the movie.”
Professor Epps also explained the nomination process of the Scripter Award.
“You’re really looking for a great initial source of work and how that initial source then translates into the screen,” he said. “A lot of that is character development, a telling narrative and involving you — you know, does it raise your heartbeat.”
After much anticipation, author Solomon Northup and screenwriter John Ridley were honored with the 26th annual Scripter Award for 12 Years A Slave. Northup’s relatives accepted the award on his behalf.
In his emotional acceptance speech, Ridley spoke of a special relationship between the writer and the originator and how Solomon Northup’s writing in particular has affected him.
“There was a question asked earlier, whether we needed books and libraries, and I can say I certainly did,” Ridley said. “Before this I didn’t know who Solomon Northup was and I didn’t know his story … Solomon, the clarity that he wrote [with], the provocative language he used and, more importantly, the strength of his character to go through what he went through without bitterness and without hate, that really taught me something.”
The Friends of USC Libraries also presented the Literary Achievement Award to Robert Towne for his incredible work in screenwriting. Some of Towne’s screenwriting credits include Mission: Impossible, Mission: Impossible II and Chinatown, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Screenplay.
Howard Rodman, co-chair of the selection committee and School of Cinematic Arts professor, explained that adaptations to film can be difficult.
“[An adaptation] can betray the book, but it can also bring it to life for audiences far larger than ones that frequent bookstores or libraries,” Rodman said. “The great adaptation will complete the circle, bringing us back to the book: make the introduction, then gently close the door from the outside to leave the two of them alone.”
Rodman continued, speaking  highly of all of the nominated screenwriters for their success and talents shown in their adapted works.
“I thought that Billy Ray did astonishingly good work in adapting Captain Phillips,” Rodman said.
Ray spoke on how he transitioned written work onto the screen.
“The source material was so good, the story was so good; I just tried not to get in its way,” he said.
Glenn Sonnenberg, co-founder of the USC Scripter Award and the president of the board of Friends of the USC Libraries, said that the founders of the USC Libraries Scripter Award were thinking about how different media can cross boundaries. He emphasized that art can be applied across different media outlets with adaptations that build on the written work’s great initial idea.
“The films we are honoring today defy the adage, ‘Never judge a book by its movie,’” Sonnenberg said.

Police are still searching for the man who shot a                     non-affiliated victim at a party at the Lorenzo apartments Friday night at approximately 11:30 p.m., according to     Sgt. Gina Holmstrom of LAPD’s Newton Community Station.
On Friday night at approximately 11:37 p.m., the Dept. of Public Safety sent out a Trojan Alert warning students that there was a shooting at the Lorenzo apartments on Adams Boulevard and the gunman was still at large. Students were advised to stay away from the area.
Two shots were fired and the injured victim was in critical condition Saturday morning at California Hospital, where he underwent surgery at 2 a.m. As of Sunday afternoon, there has been no change to the victim’s condition, said Sgt. Alex Baez, from the Newton Community Station.
“The information we have now is that there might have been some sort of argument on a fourth floor patio,” said Lt. Jon Pinto of LAPD’s Newton Community station.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said a possible suspect was seen running from the location and is still at large. The large size of the complex complicated the search.
The Lorenzo apartments were locked down for approximately two hours while police swept the hallways and parking structure, according to residents.
“They didn’t let anyone in for, like, two hours,” said Lizzie Miller, a sophomore majoring in medical anthropology.
At 1:44 a.m., a Trojan Alert notified students that the area was secure.
After shots were fired, partygoers jumped off the edge of the balcony and dangled on the railing, said Lara Keifer, an undecided freshman who was at a party two floors directly above the incident.
“A bunch of people jumped off the one story railing but we thought it was a joke or something,” she said. “But then there were a bunch of helicopters, and we got the alert. We went inside, and my friends and I locked ourselves in the bedroom.”
Other students at the apartment complex, however, were not as alarmed about the shooting.
“It was targeted and not some renegade shooter at a mall looking for random victims,” said Miller. “I was a little nervous but everyone else seemed fine, though it was kind of strange that the Lorenzo didn’t warn us in any way.”
Miller and other residents could not leave the complex during the two hours the Lorenzo was on lockdown. She said one of her friends pretended his sister was in labor in order to leave.
Other students attending parties on The Row near the Lorenzo were warned of the danger through Trojan Alerts and immediately left the area.
Jenny Kjellgren, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, was at the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity  house when she heard the news. She ordered an Uber on her phone and went back to her dorm on campus.
“It’s so scary to think there was a shooting so close to where we were,” she said.
Following the incident, students hoped for improved security at the Lorenzo.
“Security could improve, and it would be nice if DPS came over here more,” said Dillon Morgan, a junior majoring in business administration. “It doesn’t really bother us that much, though, because we’re not in the safest area anyways.”
 
Low Down Lorenzo is a bad place for USC students.  Stay away from these privately owned non USC buildings and stay closer to campus.
My son moved into Lorenzo in January.  We had some trouble with his room assignment, so I stayed in LA for 3 days.  The original plan was I would only stay for a couple of hours to sign papers, and pay for his rent.  I went to Lorenzo for 3 days because his room assignment was not a good fit and it took 3 days to get a new room assignment for him.  I saw first hand how easy it was to move around Lorenzo without a key.  We would get into an elevator and just ask the person in the elevator to push our floor.  It was never a problem to get to where we needed to go without a key.  I was also concerned that there were several non-students in the building.  I know because I asked them.  I  asked everyone I came into contact with if they were a student, because I am a nosy MOM.  Most of the kids I asked were students but there were several kids that were not students, just friends of students or just living at Lorenzo because it was a nice place.
We also rented a Zip Car and when we came back, there was a car in our space.  We told the security guard and he did not know that the space was reserved for a Zip Car.  We told him we would call Zip Car and they would tow the car.  He said he would figure it out, and a few minutes later another security guard came out and moved his car…..the security guard was parking in the Zip Car’s spot.
Security needs to change at Lorenzo and the shooting is an example of what can happen.

USC’s women’s tennis team suffered its first losses of the 2014 season this weekend, falling to No. 5 UCLA and No. 2 Florida in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Women’s Team Indoor Championship.
Before being ousted by the Bruins, the No. 6 Women of Troy (4-2) pulled off a dramatic win over No. 12 Alabama in the first round.
You got served · Junior Sabrina Santamaria struggled mightily in this weekend’s ITA National Indoor Tournament, going winless in singles play. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
USC dropped the doubles point to open up the match for the first time this season, putting itself in an early hole. Senior Brynn Boren tied the match up with a singles win, but USC fell behind 3-1 when juniors Gabriella DeSimone and Sabrina Santamaria suffered uncharacteristic losses.
After that, the team clawed its way to victory with three straight singles wins by juniors Giuliana Olmos and Zoë Scandalis and sophomore Ellie Yates, who clinched the match for the Women of Troy with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Alabama’s Natalia Maynetto on court six.
The Women of Troy couldn’t carry their momentum into the match against the Bruins. They struggled early, dropping the doubles point for only the second time this season. Santamaria and senior Kaitlyn Christian, who won the NCAA championship as a pair last season, were handed their second consecutive loss together. They fell to UCLA’s Robin Anderson and Jennifer Brady, who are currently ranked No. 1 in the nation together. The doubles team of Christian and Santamaria is currently ranked No. 33 in the nation by the ITA after being nearly unbeatable last season.
No. 13 Santamaria, who was ranked No. 1 in the nation in singles for a good deal of last season, also lost her second straight singles match — this time to UCLA’s Anderson, who currently sits atop the ITA’s leaderboard in singles. Losses by junior Giuliana Olmos and Yates finished off the match, as the Bruins swept the Women of Troy in dominant fashion.
The tough loss sent USC to the consolation round, where the team faced No. 2 Florida. The Gators had been upended by No. 16 Northwestern the day before. Santamaria and Christian emerged from their temporary slump, clinching the doubles point for the Women of Troy with a tight 7-5 win over Florida’s No. 32 squad of Sofie Oyen and Belinda Woolcock.
Despite winning the doubles point for the first time in the tournament, USC couldn’t hold off the Gators’ barrage of attackers in singles. Yates and Boren were the first to fall. Santamaria lost next, capping a winless singles streak in the tournament. Florida earned a 4-1 win when 23rd-ranked Alex Cercone defeated USC’s unranked Scandalis.
The action this weekend handed USC its first consecutive losses since March 2010.
The Women of Troy will aim to bounce back this week, as they prepare to face UC Irvine on Saturday, Feb. 15 at 11 a.m.
Would you say it is time for Coach Gallien to be replaced? Believe this is his seventeenth year, and what
has he really accomplished over that length of time. A final four, the women soccer coach won a National
Title in his first year, and now is long gone after several more seasons. Peter Smith can win four straight
national titles with the men so there is really no excuses for the other side to win at least one.

The atmosphere at the Galen Center had all the reason to be rocking. The Trojans were playing crosstown rival UCLA, tipoff was 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night, in-house DJ Mal-Ski was spinning some half-decent tunes and even USC hardwood great Nick “Swaggy P” Young was courtside with his son.
Yet as the Trojans built a surprising 41-35 halftime lead, splotches of the lower bowl at the Galen Center were empty, and row after row in certain parts of the upper area remained desolate. The Trojans collapsed within the first six minutes of the second half, and by then, the well-represented Bruin contingent was significantly audible even in USC’s most packed student section of the year. After UCLA went on a 24-5 run to open the second half, with the exception of a late Trojan flurry that cut things to 78-71, the crowd remained dormant for the duration except to boo referees’ calls. The students I talked to walking out weren’t even disappointed; they just shrugged their shoulders, enjoyed their free “Crosstown Showdown” t-shirts and happily ventured off to their Saturday night plans.
Early returns from the Andy Enfield era have been a mixed bag. He should be given somewhat of a pass due to USC’s mishmash of a roster — not ideal for running his fast-paced, three-point-based system — but there have been times when watching the Trojans has been an exercise in agony. There was the second half of Saturday night, the second half against Arizona, the entire game against Arizona State and a multitude of non-conference home bouts against inferior squads that the Trojans let hang around for far too long. After a low degree of difficulty to the non-conference slate, the Trojans have allowed more than 81 points per game in Pac-12 play. They defeated Cal at Galen for their only conference victory so far, but have lost their other four Pac-12 home games by an average of 14.3 points. In short: The home entertainment has had little value.
Enfield has been brief on the home attendance issue. His stance is that while he wishes more fans would turn up to root on his squad, he appreciates the home court advantage the Trojans do have at Galen. My take isn’t as courteous.
I usually find it fair to judge a team’s following based on its attendance for the games at the bottom of the interest-level totem pole. But if USC can’t fill out for UCLA, that’s all I need to know. The Trojans’ two most attended home games this season — and the only two filling more than 60 percent of the seats at Galen — have been Saturday night and Jan. 12 against Arizona. Neither were sellouts. Both were filled with opposing fans; UCLA because the Bruins are located a couple miles down the I-10 and up the 405, and Arizona because of the massive Wildcat alumni base in Los Angeles and the timing of the game during winter break. The Trojans have become that type of team, where the loudest contingent of fans is the one cheering for the Pac-12 visitor.
I’ll make the never perfect but ever-so-fun football comparison between the Trojans and the Bruins right now.
Even on the brightest days of the last 10 years of USC basketball, the farthest the Trojans advanced was the Sweet 16. Meanwhile, as the support for UCLA head coach Ben Howland waned last spring, he won 25 games. How many times has USC won more than 25 games in program history? Zero.
Now to football. As the Bruins celebrated their 10-win season in 2013, the Trojans endured a transition season to win the same number of games.
Just as the Trojans saw middling football attendance with a coach doomed to be fired, so did the UCLA basketball fans, despite it being the first year at a renovated Pauley Pavilion.
So as Steve Alford has UCLA at 18-5 and likely headed back to the NCAA Tournament, Enfield has USC at 10-13 and still looking to double its Pac-12 win total. Howland left the cupboard stuffed with statsheet-filler Kyle Anderson, scoring guard Jordan Adams and the wiry Norman Powell. Enfield got a group of players where for every strength, there’s an equally egregious weakness. While stars continue to fill the Galen Center — just look at Young, DeMar DeRozan and O.J. Mayo — so far, USC has been seeing stars as the losses continue.
The future is bright, but sadly for this year’s squad, fans aren’t exactly dwelling on the present.

On Saturday afternoon, the Women of Troy ended a three-game losing skid in dominant fashion, downing crosstown rival UCLA 68-54 in a blowout at the Galen Center.
Primetime performance · Cassie Harberts powered the Women of Troy with 17 points and nine rebounds during the team’s win over UCLA. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
USC (15-9, 8-4 Pac-12) never trailed in what was a crucial game as the team heads into the final stretch of its Pac-12 schedule.
With the win, the Women of Troy sweep the season series against the Bruins (11-13, 5-7), who continue to struggle in conference play. It also keeps USC in third place in the Pac-12 standings.
“We played a complete basketball game,” said USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “And the results speak for themselves.”
Saturday’s matchup was not as close as the last time the two teams met in December when USC narrowly edged out the Bruins, 56-54, at Pauley Pavilion just before the new year.
Senior forward Cassie Harberts led the way for the Women of Troy with 17 points and nine rebounds.
She was once again the catalyst for USC’s success on the block as they outscored the Bruins 38-22 in the paint. Saturday might have very well been the last time Harberts would face the rival Bruins.
The team’s constant activity on defense, something that Cooper-Dyke has continued to preach, allowed the team to create turnovers and get in the open court. The Women of Troy converted 15 turnovers into 14 fast-break points.
“Our defense allowed us to get out on some fast breaks,” Cooper-Dyke said. “Coming into the game, we knew that we wanted to run.”
The UCLA bench, which was weakened by injuries, also had a tough time keeping up with the Women of Troy — USC’s reserves outscored UCLA’s 21-0.
Junior guard Ariya Crook started the game off on the right note for the Women of Troy with a step-back three-point jumper that set the tone for the rest of the game. Crook finished the game with 10 points.
The Bruins tried to catch USC off guard by coming out in a couple different zones and presses to begin the game, but the Women of Troy would not be rattled.
An 8-0 run to start the game sparked by senior forward Desireé Bradley’s four-point spark off the bench allowed the Women of Troy to jump out to a 13-4 lead. Bradley netted seven points in her last home game against the Bruins.
“I’ve always tried to be a spark off the bench for my teammates,” Bradley said. “I think I was able to get back to doing that and I hope it gave my team a boost.”
There was really no looking back from there, as the Women of Troy took a 33-20 lead into halftime.
The second half would begin a lot like the first, with USC coming out of the gates on a 13-5 run in the opening minutes to jump out to a commanding 46-25 lead. The team was able to rally behind behind a fairly loud Galen Center crowd, most of who stuck around for the men’s contest that would follow.
“[It was] one of our best starts to a game and starts to a second half,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We started the game with the correct level of intensity, we played great defense and we executed on the offensive end.”
USC would go on to shoot a little more than 40 percent for the game and nearly matched that from long range, going five-for-13 from the three-point line.
Two of those three-point field goals came from freshman guard Courtney Jaco, who was a perfect two-for-two from long range and finished with eight points.
“Coach Cooper just told me to stay ready, be ready to shoot, and my teammates found me the ball and I knocked it down,” Jaco said.
If there was an area where the Women of Troy showed weakness, it was at the free-throw line. USC shot a dismal 7-for-15 at the charity stripe, which was good for just more than 46 percent — well below the team’s season average of 66 percent.
The Bruins would not concede the game easily, scoring nine straight points to cut the lead to 52-42 with a little more than six minutes remaining.
Another Crook three-pointer would halt that UCLA momentum, though, making it a 13-point game. USC would never allow the Bruins to get back into the game, adding on to their double-digit lead to pick up another important conference win.
The USC women’s basketball team will go back on the road this weekend to take on the Oregon schools, whom USC swept at the Galen Center in their previous matchups. The Women of Troy will take on Oregon in Eugene, Ore. at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, before meeting up with Oregon State for a 12 p.m. Sunday matinee in Corvallis, Ore.

The USC men’s basketball team suffered another conference loss Saturday night at the Galen Center when they fell to the visiting UCLA Bruins, 83-73.
 
In all fairness, the Trojans put up a fight.
That seems to be the season-long trend that has afflicted this year’s USC men’s basketball team. Game in and game out the Trojans (10-13, 1-9 Pac-12) have shown flashes of brilliance, putting together stretches where it seemed as if head coach Andy Enfield’s squad had finally put it together.
Worthy effort · Junior guard Byron Wesley led all scorers on Saturday night with 27 points, but could not push his team past UCLA. Wesley excited the home crowd by making four consecutive three-pointers in the first half. – JoJo Korsh | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately, paradise for these Trojans does not last, and, more often than not, the brilliance is followed by borderline basketball incompetence. This time around, the Trojans lost their promising halftime lead just minutes after the break.
Saturday’s clash with crosstown rival UCLA (18-5, 7-3) was no different.
The Trojans came firing out of the gate, building a double digit lead off of some stellar outside shooting and great defensive work. Junior guard Byron Wesley was once again impressive, finishing the first half with 18 points, going 4-4 from beyond the arc en route to a 27-point performance. Wesley’s scoring tally led both teams.
The wheels came off in the second half for USC, though, with the Bruins finding their footing from outside and the Trojans losing their composure on offense. UCLA went on a 14-1 run early in the second half to build a 13-point cushion, and coasted to the finish on their way to an 83-73 win over USC and a season sweep of their rivals.
Enfield, visibly frustrated with his team’s performance in conference play this year, was complimentary of his opponent.  The Trojans’ head coach gave UCLA credit for the win.
“They have exceptional players,” Enfield said. “They’re very well-coached, and they played at an extremely high level today.”
The former Florida Gulf Coast coach, however, did note his team’s inability to respond to runs like the Bruins had in the second half as a major issue plaguing the Trojans.
“Teams have gone on runs and we haven’t been able to stop them,” Enfield said. “We need to handle those runs a little better.”
Fans and players alike are finding it difficult to find silver linings in these conference losses. The Trojans are dead last in the Pac-12, meaning they have a likely first round date with juggernauts Arizona or UCLA in the conference tournament looming ahead. Enfield was aware of his team’s tendency to keep games close — only to end up losing when time expires.
“We’ve been ‘in’ a lot of games we lost,” Enfield said. “I know our players are frustrated but they are working hard.”
Freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic has been one of the few bright spots on this year’s squad, and, like most of the players, is choosing to look ahead to the next game instead of dwelling on the mounting losses. The first-year player out of Serbia preached Enfield’s message of improving as a team.
“We just need to play more as a team and be focused,” Jovanovic said. “Just team effort.”
Jovanovic, Wesley and every member of this year’s squad have put forth considerable effort in attempting to turn USC into a contender.
Enfield was brought in not only to help with that task, but to bring excitement back to USC basketball and bring fans into the Galen Center.
Many fans did show up on Saturday, and the Trojans had a prime chance to give their long-suffering loyalists a glimmer of hope for the future.
Instead, USC showed once again that it is not on the same level as the conference elite, and the Trojan faithful went home disappointed.
USC will stay at the Galen Center for their next set of games, hosting the Utah Runnin’ Utes on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and the Colorado Buffaloes on Sunday at 5 p.m. The Trojans will still be seeking an elusive second conference victory.
 
Actually, USC will likely get bounced in the first round, thereby sparing it the humility of a crushing blowout against a quality team like Arizona, UCLA, or ASU. But you’ve still got Enfield who took Florida Gulf Coast to the Sweet 16 in only his second year and has promised to do the same for you.
The top 4 teams get a first round bye in the pac12, so a first round matchup with AZ is not looming. We will end up playing the 5 seed, and if we win, the 4 seed next – so we axtually avoid the best teams for 2 rounds.

With a rapidly changing world of technology and people continuously abandoning the personal computer and turning to mobile devices and the Internet for their daily tasks, worldwide leader Microsoft is trying to keep up. The technology giant announced that Satya Nadella, who was previously head of the company’s cloud and enterprise group, will take over for Steve Ballmer as the next CEO of Microsoft.
Nadella will be leading Microsoft at a very curious time for the company. Beginning with the Windows Phone, the company has attempted to unify its products in a method even grander than that of its biggest competitor, Apple. The company condensed some products under different umbrellas with its music service “Xbox Music,” folded Hotmail into a revamped Outlook.com and moved Microsoft Office into the cloud with Office 365.
Microsoft has only continued to push forward in the mobile market, acquiring the mobile technology of Nokia after a notable partnership that, while producing a series of memorable and colorful devices, wasn’t able to make a dent in the iOS and Android duopoly of the market.
The emphasis on cloud computing is likely why Nadella was selected to be the new leader for Microsoft as it attempts to bring its products even closer together. One of its latest products, Xbox One, is expected to use cloud processing in the near future to give additional strength to its gaming lineup. The potential of this development is limitless.
Yet Microsoft’s recent forays do give some pundits a bit of doubt about whether it’s enough to turn the tide. Just more than a year ago with the launch of Windows 8, it was expected that Steven Sinofsky, the man who helped Microsoft rebound from the debacle of Windows Vista with the well-received Windows 7, would take over. But in November 2012, Sinofsky left the company and Windows 8 has had a rough start, even if there’s some credit due for its ambitious touch-based interface.
It didn’t help that one of the cornerstones of Windows 8, the Surface tablet, has been a huge money loss for Microsoft, dashing hopes that it would become a competitor to the iPad. Sinofsky’s exit seems to represent some internal tension within the company as its attempts to break into both the tablet market and mobile market have proven fruitless.
It’s no wonder, then, that Bill Gates himself has decided to get into the foray, as it was also announced that he would be stepping down as chairman of the board and would begin serving instead as a technology advisor (even though he is still expected to spend most of his time with his charity foundation). Still, the fact that Gates sees that his skills are needed in the current environment of Microsoft speaks volumes.
The hire of Satya Nadella points not just to a change in focus, but also to change in company philosophy. By boosting cloud processing, it’s possible that the world could see a true cloud-based OS shared across all of its products, an Xbox One connecting with one’s PC, connecting with one’s phone, connecting with one’s SkyDrive and connecting to a Surface. The ideal here seems to be a combination of Google’s Chrome OS, but much more ambitious and robust.
Whether or not Microsoft can achieve this while creating a unique visual aesthetic (without betraying its utilitarian reliability) is perhaps the hardest challenge facing Nadella. A competitive market is the best market, and although the company has made strides in improving and simplifying its product line, it’s going to take a focused effort to establish itself as Apple’s equal instead of a fading giant.

Sometimes all you need is a guitar and a bench, especially when your music is as good as Ross Golan’s in the world premiere of The Wrong Man. Aided by projections and a dancing woman, the lead actor mostly sat and sang but offered a compelling performance. More of a concert with a story than anything else, the audience quickly learned that that was all they needed. The show is running at the Skylight Theater through March 16.
Man, oh man · Ross Nolan, who graduated from USC in 2001, plays the leading role of Duran in The Wrong Man, an original musical that is currently playing at the Skylight Theater in Los Angeles. – Photo courtesy of Ken Werther Pubiicity
 
This production is all about Ross Golan, who not only wrote the story, music and lyrics for the show, but also plays the leading man, Duran. Golan graduated from USC in 2001 ith a degree in music industry. Since his time at USC, Golan has become a successful songwriter, working with major stars such as Maroon 5, Lady Antebellum and even Justin Bieber. It is easy to see why he has gone so far in the music industry — his lyrics are fantastic. Sometimes slow and easy, others rap-like and angry, Golan is able to capture every emotion on the spectrum through his music and lyrics.
The Wrong Man, inspired by Johnny Cash’s iconic tune “Folsom Prison Blues,” tells the story of a one-night stand gone wrong, an interpretation of “I shot a man in Reno/ Just to watch him die.” It is a song cycle, following Duran from the one-night stand to a pregnancy discovery to a dead man and a death sentence. The songs include sung dialogue and the inner thoughts of Duran, as well as action description. Duran even sings (in falsetto) the lines of Mariana (played by Jennifer Brasuell), the woman who sparks the whole story.
Projection designer Adam Flemming and videographer Michael Alan Hoy had a lot of work on their hands, designing the only visual aid for the whole show. The projections run sporadically and always seem to complement the moment perfectly. During some songs, the projections are a film, with the two main actors re-enacting exactly what Duran is singing. During others, the images are merely abstract shapes and colors, creating a moody backdrop for more singular moments.
The projections helped keep the show from getting boring and quickly answered the question: “How will a guy sitting with an acoustic guitar act out a play?” They were not at all over used, and helped to break up the potential monotony of the visual. The scenes themselves were very well-directed, always toeing the line between reality and dream-like sequences. The footage could almost be released as a short film itself (with Golan’s accompaniment, of course).
The one aspect that did distract from Golan’s music was the character of Mariana. Throughout many scenes, Mariana dances around and next to Duran. Sometimes it is just choreographed walking and posing, other times she is rolling on the floor. There were moments when it worked nicely, but at others it was strange. Golan, a very normal-looking guy in baggy jeans, was singing soulfully and naturally, when an attractive woman in lacy black lingerie prances around next to him. It just didn’t fit. Instead of randomly moving around in a lyrical way, the character could have been performing real modern choreography to fit the music it would have been interesting. But the format itself already reminds the audience we’re in an alternate reality of sorts, and her performance could have been intensified to reflect that. Brasuell is a beautiful woman as well as a dancer, but her part was not altogether necessary.
Golan does a respectable job of bringing up the important topic of the death penalty in an interesting, musical way. Duran is an incredibly sympathetic character, and the audience is deeply affected by his wrongful conviction. The sad ending, accompanied by the final song “Exit Me (Fade to Black)” is an oddly soothing conclusion to Duran’s life. His journey through the legal system is incredibly disturbing, and Golan must be applauded for refusing to sugarcoat this issue.
Golan so easily brings the audience on a journey, using only his voice. His songs range from low and melodic (“Almost Hopeless”) to clever and funny (“Walk of Shame”) to heartbreaking (“What Happens Here Stays Here”). Some songs had the entire audience bobbing their heads along with Duran, others left them still and shocked. At times it seemed as though there were more instruments and more singers than just Golan and his guitar — the sound filled the space that well.
Though the projections are helpful to move the story along, closing your eyes and tapping your toe along to the rhythm is all you need to enjoy it.

A TV in the corner of the room shows John, Paul, George and Ringo, one by one, bowl haircut after bowl haircut, make their way onto a stage. It’s the iconic black and white footage of the Beatles’ appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The show was one of the landmark events on the band’s 1964 U.S. tour, which is the subject of the Morrison Hotel Gallery’s newest exhibit, “Commemorating the Golden Anniversary of the Year America Met the Beatles.” The exhibit celebrates the 50th anniversary of the visit that changed the nation’s popular culture forever, featuring images from photographers with intimate access to the group over the course of the two-week tour.
The images document some of the trip’s biggest moments, including The Beatles’ arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport, their performances in Washington, D.C. and Miami and even their encounter with heavyweight champion of the time Cassius Clay, now known as Muhammad Ali.
The 25 images on display include some of the best work from photographers such as Ken Regan, Charles Trainor, Curt Gunther, Robert Whitaker, Rowland Scherman and Terry O’Neill. All photos on display are available to purchase with prices ranging from $1,000 to $8,000.
The Morrison Hotel Gallery, a leading brand in fine art music photography, organized the event. Julian Lennon, son of John Lennon, curated the special event. Lennon hand-picked each of the 25 images, which he thinks best portray his father’s famous tour. Lennon is a world-renowned photographer himself and has been working with the Morrison Hotel Gallery for a few years.
“He’s a friend of the gallery,” said Gerry Baum, a sales associate at the West Hollywood Gallery. “I can’t remember who approached who about the exhibit, but it’s something we’ve been thinking of doing for quite some time.”
Lennon will not be in Los Angeles for the duration of the exhibit but will be promoting his sixth studio album Everything Changes, along with his documentary Through the Picture Window.
The exhibit, located in a side room of the lobby of the Sunset Marquis hotel in West Hollywood, is surprisingly small — all 25 images are located in just one room. But what the exhibit lacks in space and quantity, it makes up for in quality and ambiance.
Much of the 1964 tour was larger-than-life, but the behind the scenes look shows the humanity of the group. As much as stardom painted these figures as gods, photography can remind us of their mortality and vulnerability. Ultimately, The Beatles were just four talented guys from Liverpool, U.K.
Naturally, the exhibit caters to The Beatles fanatic more than the outsider. Some photos are easy to glance over, but in fact have a deep significance. One such photo captures an intimate moment between George Harrison and model Pattie Boyd who was engaged to another man at the time.
This is not to say, however, that you need to have studied The Beatles or even listened to one of their songs to enjoy the exhibit. If one does not know much about the band, he or she will after leaving. Much of this is due to the nature of the exhibit; the photos capture the group’s introduction to the United States for their grand unveiling.
The exhibit is a window into a time and place very different from the present. For those who experienced the 1960s, the gallery offers a nostalgic memory of the era. The clips of The Ed Sullivan Show call back the styles, sounds and personalities of the time.
For the younger crowd, the exhibit offers a cultural history lesson. It is hard to truly grasp the impact the foursome from Liverpool had on the world until you see the images of adult women crying at the sight of The Beatles, or hear their ovation on The Ed Sullivan Show. They are much more than a ’60s version of One Direction.
The setting of the exhibit alone is worth the price of admission. The location of the Sunset Marquis makes patrons feel cultured purely by virtue of the environment. The gallery sits opposite the hip Bar 1200 which complements the experience. The dimly lit bar plays Beatles B-side albums and radiates an aura of cool. The quality photography and the hip vibe make it a prime destination for L.A. cultural tourism.
 
“The Beatles: A 50th Anniversary Celebration of Photography” runs through the month of February.

 USC should support MyFigueroa project
Dozens of people packed into the small hearing room at Los Angeles City Hall a few weeks ago. Many stood firm and spoke eloquently in defense of an ongoing project that could bring massive improvements to bike culture and neighborhood infrastructure in our corner of Los Angeles: the Figueroa Corridor Streetscape project, also known as MyFigueroa.
MyFigueroa is an ongoing effort to redesign the Figueroa Corridor that begins just south of USC (at the intersection of Figueroa St. and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) and extends north to Downtown Los Angeles at 7th Street. The project would produce extended sidewalks for pedestrians along the three miles of road stretching between our university and the downtown neighborhood, and importantly would introduce the first ever protected bikeway in Los Angeles, separated from car traffic by a curb. The project would provide better access for students to Downtown Los Angeles’s booming economy: new apartment complexes and other housing options; new restaurants and bars and new retail locations, like the ever-expanding Fig@7th shopping mall and food court. Further, we would witness a decrease in pedestrian and bike collisions and accidents, in addition to a positive impact on local businesses. This effort would positively alter undergraduate and graduate life for USC students, as well as aid students, faculty and staff that commute to school by bicycle and public transit.
But there is a major problem: USC administrators have introduced roadblocks to MyFigueroa becoming reality. As a member of the new USC Bicycle Coalition, I stood in that room in City Hall and defended the project in its current iteration, extending along the full length on both sides of Figueroa Street. However, David Galaviz — currently the executive director of USC’s Local Government Relations — gave support of a motion to delay the project for further traffic analysis, on top of an already complete and sufficient report conducted by the L.A. Department of Transportation. The motion could also potentially push the bike lanes onto Flower Street or other roads to the east, farther from the USC community that would benefit. Making an official statement for USC, Galaviz argued that due to USC’s frequent events, MyFigueroa would create further traffic problems, and therefore USC is seeking to extend the timeline for additional analysis: unnecessary, given LADOT’s comprehensive report. Unfortunately, USC administrators view MyFigueroa as a traffic problem instead of an opportunity to connect students to Los Angeles’ many attractions and improve the quality of campus life.
As a USC graduate student, a longtime resident of Downtown Los Angeles and a regular cyclist and public transit rider in Los Angeles (yes, I still do not own a car after living here for 3 years), I cannot stand for administrators — devoid of contact with the lifestyles of USC students and employees — to mandate a blockade around a real and necessitated component of bringing vitality and safety to Los Angeles and the University of Southern California’s local community. Even though I have been commuting by bicycle for more than 10 years, my initial experiences on the roads in Los Angeles were distressing: almost grazed or hit multiple times by cars that are just not used to having bikes on the road. Within Los Angeles’ car-centric culture, the roads are still not comfortable to ride on. Though new lanes have begun to be introduced across the city, the route from DTLA to USC is still lacking. I ride at a fast pace with a lot of experience; my worries exponentially increase to real danger for people riding without that experience. USC boasts the highest rate of bike ridership in Los Angeles, yet many of these students have little experience riding a bike in a major city.
On Tuesday, Jan. 28, representatives at City Hall allowed a 30-day extension to propose alternatives to MyFigueroa’s current plan along both sides of Figueroa Street. We, the students, faculty and staff of USC, have the opportunity to challenge administrators’ misinformed decision and reverse any potential changes to this project, by making public statements — through student government and employee organizations — in support of MyFig.

Shame on the USC administration. This project should be a no-brainer. Increased safety for USC students and Los Angeles residents, better connections between USC and DTLA, and to top it all off its being paid for with a grant from the federal government. Get it together, USC.
Many USC students use bicycles for transportation.  The University should do everything in its power to protect their students on bicycles, and walking
.
 The University should take the lead in facilitating greater student safety.  Since the university can’t provide on campus housing for all the students that they enroll, it it their responsibility to ensure student safety, as the University creates the need for students to commute to campus in the first place.
I agree with Alex. As a university that reports 8,000 students who commute by bicycle, USC should be doing everything it can to provide for safety of all, including better visibility of people riding bikes for those that commute by car.
These lanes will make getting to and from Downtown safe and easy for students, staff, and professors. To oppose this is painfully short-sighted.
You are right- seems like USC officials are out of touch with the realities students in the area face. A safer, better, more inviting connection to DTLA from USC really makes sense!
Totally agree.  USC should be excited about this project, not trying to block it.
I’ll be in favor of your stupid bike lane when you fools on bikes start obeying the rules of the road.  Also bicyclist should start wearing pants appropriate for their age and body type…
If you are claiming that bicyclists violate the law with higher incidence than motorists, I would like to see credible evidence for that. There are plenty of fools in cars that break the law – by your reasoning, we should take away your stupid car lanes.
As for the pants bit, I honestly just laughed at that. What does that even mean? LOL

Ask me the score of the UCLA vs. USC basketball game that took place this weekend and I’ll tell you. USC lost to our crosstown rivals 83 to 73. I know this because I was there, sitting through every gut-wrenching moment when the Westwood team took the wind out of the Trojans.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
On that same day, the USC women’s basketball team played UCLA as well. But I couldn’t tell you the score unless I Googled it beforehand. I couldn’t tell you who won, and I couldn’t describe any highlights. And, it’s not because I’m suffering from sudden amnesia — it’s simply because I did not attend the game. Looking back, I’m disappointed in myself for it.
When I asked one of my friends about the crowd for the women’s game, she said, “There were a good amount of people there but not nearly as much as the men’s game.”
That statement struck a chord with me. It appears no matter how skilled the female athletes might be, and no matter how successful they are, it’s hard for us to rally the troops for their games.
In truth, I can’t critique others for holding back on their  ‘SC spirit when I have yet to get out to a single women’s sporting event. But then again, this trend does not stop at the collegiate level. It’s fair to say that the Women’s  National Basketball Association does not have nearly as grand of a fanbase as the National Basketball Association. Though NBA games draw millions of viewers, WNBA games remain in the hundreds of thousands. Viewership of WNBA games peaked at 455,000, according to the WNBA website. And WNBA salaries have yet to reach the level of NBA salaries. 2011’s top draft pick, Maya Moore, earned $47,000 for her first season in the WNBA, according to the Star Tribune.
But there’s a bigger issue brewing beneath the numbers — the perception of women’s sports in general.
I had one friend suggest the reason for the WNBA’s poor viewership is because “women aren’t nearly as fast as men.”
Other individuals, such as Sports Illustrated columnist Jeff Pearlman, feel the same. Pearlman unfairly equates the WNBA’s slow takeoff to the skill of female athletes.
“As blessed as women like [Candace] Parker and Lauren Jackson and Diana Taurasi are at basketball, their skills are not in visual demand,” Pearlman wrote in his column. “Basketball fans want to see LeBron James dunk and Josh Smith soar through the air and Ron Artest lock down on an opposing scorer. They want to see Ray Allen launch a three from the middle of nowhere and Dwight Howard hit the rim with his forehead.”
Such commentary further reinforces the notion that a woman will never match a man’s skill level no matter how hard she works and regardless of how much time she devotes to her sport.
Pearlman argues further, “No matter how many women dunk, no matter how incredible the playoff action might seem, no matter if the league expands to Las Vegas and Cancun and hires the cast members of Glee to hand out $100 bills to every customer, well, the WNBA is what it is — a fringe entity.”
Such a statement implies that women, regardless of their achievements, will always be inferior to men. This type of mockery is unacceptable and cannot be condoned.
Thankfully, there are those who speak out against such unfairness.
In response to Pearlman’s article, one blogger wrote, “To compare apples to oranges (WNBA to NBA) is to say that men and women exist in a homogeneous grouping, genetically, physically, and cognitively. We know this not to be true. Does this make one better than the other? Absolutely not. Even though the argument between the genders has raged on for centuries, I doubt it will stop any time soon.”
Though I cannot single-handedly silence all the critics of women’s sports, there’s one thing I can do starting today: show up. Maybe I don’t know the difference between a point guard and shooting guard, but I can still cheer and clap. With this new year ahead of me, I’m going to make a promise to myself: Even in the middle of excessive IR211 readings, I’m going to make my way down to the Galen Center to support my Women of Troy.

Sorry, but women’s athletics IS inferior to men’s, and always will be.  It’s ok to say men and women are different; both genders do certain things better than the other.  That’s ok!! 
Here is the good news – if The Women of Troy start winning consistently for many years the crowds will grow larger, not because the women’s game is more visually appealing (because it’s not even close), but because we all like to be around winners.   We are on the right track with Cynthia Cooper as HC.
Rini, if you want to know what’s going on with USC Women’s sports, then subscribe to @USC_Athletics or http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2014/feb and you’ll get all the news. The problem with attendance in women’s sports is that these sprorts aren’t exciting. The women’s sports teams are there because of Title9, not because the athletic department  has special funding or student interest.
If I remember correctly there are 19 women’s sports and 9 men’s sports at USC, so it’s not for a lack of trying.
Sorry 12 mens sports.
This was a very well written satirical article.
