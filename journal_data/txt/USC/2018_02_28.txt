Prospective students who participate in peaceful political activities and protests will not be penalized for their actions, Associate Dean and Director of Undergraduate Admissions Kirk Brennan said in a blog post Saturday. 
The post comes in response to many high schools stating they would punish students who participated in protests against gun violence following the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. earlier this month.
“I wrote the blog post in response to news reports that stated some school districts would automatically suspend students for participating in demonstrations surrounding the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,” Brennan said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
Rather than punish students, the USC Office of Undergraduate Admission hopes that students feel comfortable expressing their values. 
“Furthering knowledge requires students and faculty who are willing to share their views and consider others,” the blog post said. “Therefore, we do not penalize students for speaking up. In fact, we seek them.”
“An admission application isn’t an opportunity for punishment,” Brennan said. “We want to be confident that students we invite to become a part of USC will not be threats to the health and safety of the community. Each of the tens of thousands of students who apply for admission receive a fair, respectful review.”
According to the post, although the admissions office sometimes denies or rescinds students who do not uphold USC’s values and standards, they make an effort to fully understand applicant’s actions. 
“We have … welcomed students who have shown they have moved beyond temporary lapses in judgment,” the post said. “The goal is education, not further punishment.”
“Many admission deans and directors around the country felt we needed to assure students such a disciplinary action wouldn’t necessarily disqualify them from going to college,” Brennan wrote in the email. “Many colleges are making similar statements. I had hoped to broadly describe how we handle applications which present information about disciplinary infractions.”

Undergraduate Student Government officials from the advocacy branch and the senate introduced a resolution which would allocate funds from the student health fee toward subsidizing Sexually Transmitted Infection and Sexually Transmitted Disease tests through Engemann Student Health Center at the USG Senate meeting Tuesday.

According to Speaker Pro Tempore Tyler Matheson, Senator Buck Andrews and Director of Wellness Affairs Marina Hrovat, the resolution aims to expand access and incentives for students to acquire tests they may need. The resolution would apply to all USC students, regardless of their insurance plan.
“We want to build from those [Affordable Care Act] guidelines and make the tests more accessible for students,” Andrews said. “A lot of students have financial barriers and if they are unable to pay for the tests, they can spread the infection to other students. This can create a public health hazard for students not to be able to be tested.”
Hrovat said USG is proposing that the Engemann Student Health Center consider increasing the student health fee to account for the subsidies proposed for these tests.
“The student health fee increases annually just like our tuition and any other health fee,” Hrovat said. “Right now, Engemann is still working on what these numbers are going to roll out to be. Our proposal here is that this be taken into consideration when we are looking at the growth of the cost of the student health fee.”
Andrews emphasized, however, that the resolution is not yet final. Advocacy officials and senators intend to continue modifying and polishing the resolution prior to voting.
“This is still a resolution,” Andrews said. “It’s being worked out so there are going to be kinks with it, especially because it has to do with healthcare. It’s going to be adaptable.”
Matheson referenced statistics showing increases in STI rates cited in the resolution to highlight the urgency and significance of the initiative. He also noted that the statistics increased to a greater degree on the West Coast than the rest of the United States. 
“Between 2015 and 2016 cases of chlamydia rose 4.7 percent, syphilis infections rose 17.6 percent, congenital syphilis rose 27.6 percent, and gonorrhea infection rate increased 22.2 percent among males,” Matheson said.
The USG Senate will vote on the resolution at its meeting next Tuesday night.

Throughout his youth, Omar Siddiqui aspired to become a Renaissance man. Inspired by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin, Siddiqui, an alumnus of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, now hopes to expand his career politically in a run for the U.S. House of Representatives to represent California’s 48th District in this year’s midterm elections.

“After Benjamin Franklin debated with his fellow congressmen about the Declaration of Independence, he’s [still] out there doing science experiments,” he said. “[These men] merged science, technology, engineering and math with the humanities, arts and law.”
Siddiqui wants to bring the diversity of his experiences, specifically his knowledge of national security and emphasis on human rights, to Congress. 
After Siddiqui completed his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in civil and environmental engineering at USC, he enrolled in law school at Loyola Marymount University to fulfill his career goal as a trial lawyer and litigator. During his legal career, Siddiqui was recruited to work on national security matters with the Federal Bureau of Investigation under former President Barack Obama’s administration and served as an adviser to the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Siddiqui attributed his entrance into the political arena to Obama and former FBI Director James Comey: two men whose words stuck with him as he started his campaign for Congress.
“It was October [or] November of 2016, and I was venting to President Obama about the state of our nation and the direction it was headed in,” Siddiqui said. “He was telling me, like his famous quote, ‘Be the change you want to be. Be that change. What are you waiting for?’ I was reflecting on that, on that move to go from attorney to a [politician].”
Likewise, Comey echoed similar sentiments to Siddiqui: There was no time to sit around. 
Comey’s dismissal from the FBI by President Donald Trump in April 2017 unsettled Siddiqui and inspired him to announce his campaign in July.
“That was a defining moment for me because I realized there was no time to stand around,” he said. “I can no longer sit on the sidelines. I have to be that change.” 
The 48th district comprises several Orange County cities, like Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Westminster and Santa Ana, whose populations are majority white, although there exist thriving Asian and Hispanic communities.
Despite the district’s historically Republican voting patterns, Siddiqui aims to focus on issues voters across the political spectrum believe are important, such as national security, healthcare and environmental policy. 
“Now, our country is really divided on political party [lines],” Siddiqui said. “One thing we need to be united on is our national security. It’s not a partisan issue if you have a foreign nation like Russia interfering with our elections and our democracy.”
He says his inclusive messaging is also represented in his platform, which outlines Siddiqui’s support for marginalized groups and their rights in the U.S. 
“I’m for a clean [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] bill and taking it one step further to give them an opportunity to have a pathway to citizenship,” he said, commenting on Congress’ current struggle with immigration reform. “But, we can’t just think of the Dreamers alone. We also have to think of other 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in our country. We need to make sure we have immigration reform that affects everybody.”
Siddiqui’s campaign slogan, “United We Rise,” embodies his goal to connect with voters regardless of political party. 
“We are moving and getting a lot of Republicans and Democrats and no-party preference voters to come out to the polls and be that change,” he said. “I think a lot of people feel that their vote doesn’t count but we’re spreading the message that every vote counts, and everyone counts.”

Norman Topping Student Aid Fund scholars and faculty members gathered together on Tuesday at the USC Town & Gown for a previously canceled faculty-student luncheon. Following the elimination of Christina Yokoyama’s position as program director on Feb. 1, this event was repurposed for the scholars’ “#SaveTopping” call to action movement.

According to Yokoyama, faculty-student luncheons like this one provide Topping scholars with the opportunity to establish a relationship with their professors outside of the classroom. But at this luncheon, which marked the first major event since Yokoyama’s elimination, Topping Fund members thought of ways to work more closely with the University to make sure that they agree with the administration’s restructuring efforts in the future during the luncheon. 
“It was different in that we weren’t talking about what Topping does,” Yokoyama said. “We were talking about what’s happened since Jan. 2 when I was informed of the elimination of the position … I felt compelled to really applaud the efforts of the movement.”
Sabrina Enriquez, a Topping Scholar and senior majoring in mathematics, and Topping Governing Board Chair Sierra Williams provided updates on the program’s Call to Action efforts and meetings with Provost Michael Quick and Vice Provost of undergraduate programs Andrea Hodge.
Enriquez said that there were issues with scheduling the luncheon. After Yokoyama’s removal, the official master calendar of events were taken off of the program’s website. According to Enriquez, she was notified by Hodge that the luncheon scheduled for Tuesday was canceled.
“We never had an event that was planned so far in advance changed,” Enriquez said. “So we took it upon ourselves to still plan the event [for] when it was supposed to take place.”
On Feb. 7, Hodge released a memo to the Topping Fund. Hodge said that another faculty-student luncheon will be held at The Vineyard Room on March 28. Hodge will be attending the event to meet the Topping scholars. 
After Enriquez addressed this lack of communication with Hodge via email, Enriquez was told on Feb. 16 that in response to the backlash from the program in response to the cancellation of the original date, the March 28 luncheon will still be set on the program’s calendar.
“I offered if she wanted to fund [Tuesday’s luncheon], and I offered if she wanted to write an update or memos that I could read … at our faculty-student luncheon, and she emailed me [Monday] that she thought about it and that she would be giving updates at the later date,” Enriquez said. “She decided that she was not going to help fund [this luncheon].”
The luncheon followed with a keynote speaker address from Sumun Pendakur, the Chief learning officer and director of the USC Equity Institutes at the Rossier School of Education, and closing remarks from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Professor George Sanchez.
“We still have a lot of questions that have not been answered by the administration, specifically by Provost Quick or by Vice Provost Andrea Hodge about why the actions that they took at the beginning of the semester happened,” Sanchez said. “I talked about the fact that this is very disturbing because it’s not the University’s money. It’s the students’ money over the last 50 years that have contributed to the Topping Fund.”
During the event, Topping scholars brainstormed ideas for their next actions moving forward with the program. According to Sanchez, while Topping scholars are unsure of what to do in the next few weeks, collectively coming up with ideas at the luncheon was a step in the right direction.
“We don’t know what the program is right now,” Sanchez said. “It’s not clear if the same program that faculty have supported over the last 50 years is the same program the University now has … And this has to be cleared up.”

USC women’s lacrosse goaltender Gussie Johns received Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week honors on Monday. This is the second weekly honor that the senior has received for her defensive skills on the field this season. 
Senior goaltender Gussie Johns has recorded 36 saves in four games so far this season. Daily Trojan file photo.
The Washington, D.C.-native has produced multiple big games this season. During USC’s 11-8 win over No. 18 Notre Dame on the road, Johns recorded 11 saves. In a loss against No. 10 Northwestern, Johns managed to add four saves and four ground balls.
“During practice, our main focus is to build on what we want to be both individually and as a team and fix the things from the past game,” Johns said. “Right now we are just taking it game by game, but I am excited to be back at McAlister Field with the team.” 
The team will face off against No. 2 Boston College at McAlister Field on March 7 in USC’s first home game of the 2018 season. This game is particularly important for the women’s lacrosse team as it doubles as a rematch of the 2017 NCAA Quarterfinals in which the Eagles eliminated the Trojans. 
“I am excited to play BC,” Johns said. “They are a good opponent, so it’ll be an interesting game for sure.”
Before USC started competing in the Pac-12 for lacrosse for the first time this season, Johns won MPSF Defensive Player of the Week three times and was chosen on once as the league’s Rookie of the Week.
Johns is one of two goalies named to the U.S. Women’s National Team roster for the 2017 FIL World Cup. She is also the the first-ever USC lacrosse player to be chosen for the U.S. senior national team and compete for Team USA in the FIL World Cup.

The women’s basketball team may have started their regular season with three losses, but they fought back and finished the season strong to end 9-9 in the Pac-12 and 19-10 overall. Their last game of the regular season against Colorado on Saturday allowed the team to clinch the No. 7 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament, setting them up to play against Washington State in the first round on Thursday.

“We go into the Pac-12 Tournament with 19 wins,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “That’s pretty good. These kids have somehow squeezed out 19 wins out of this season, 9-9 in a very tough conference …. I think we’ve got a chance. We’re going to play everybody.”
While their conference record may be modest, the team has taken many top-ranked opponents down to the wire. From forcing double overtime with Oregon to holding UCLA to only 59 points, the team has challenged their opponents from the first whistle to the last. Out of their nine losses, four of them ended with the Trojans finishing within 10 points, while three were within 5 points. For Trakh, that shows the team’s heart and how much they enjoy playing together. 
“I think the big thing with this team though is if we lose three in a row we do not check out,” Trakh said. “We lost our first three and they didn’t check out. Then, we won two and then lost two, won two and then lost two. They never checked out and that is just being resilient.”
They are going to need to keep that resilience alive as they prepare to take on Washington State. In their last meeting in January, the Trojans came out on top with a 73-72 victory. Every second of their last game was a battle, with 12 lead changes throughout the course of the game. While senior forward Kristin Simon finished with a double-double of 24 points and 13 rebounds and junior guard Aliyah Mazyck contributed her own 25 points, it was their combined defensive effort that secured their close victory. 
Sophomore guard Minyon Moore led the charge with eight of her team’s 13 steals. From there, the team was able to convert 26 points of Washington State’s 17 turnovers, which proved vital in the last quarter. The Cougars were up by 10 points before the Trojans would charge back. With WSU’s chance to tie it up in the final seconds, it would be the Trojans’ clean defense, with everyone stepping up, that would keep the victory in their hands. 
“They play for each other right now and that’s what’s great,” Trakh said. “Just to see them play for each other and see their leadership. I think that’s the thing I’m most proud of.”
But more than anything, the team is ready for what comes next. The starters have all been averaging over 30 minutes a game, with many of them playing a full 40 minutes on multiple occasions. The team is in shape, has fought for its position in the tournament and is ready to face a familiar opponent. However, while they plan on looking at their past to help prepare for the tournament, they are also viewing it as just another beginning.
“We’re not done,” Trakh said. “We start our third season now. We’re 0-0. Third season’s the Pac-12 Tournament and the fourth season is the NCAA Tournament, hopefully. Now, it is within reach, I really feel.”
While he knows there is more work to be done, Trahk sees his first season back with USC as a major success. 
“I’m really proud of these kids from when we took over on May 1,” Trakh said. “I think the coaching staff had to earn the team’s trust and at the same time they had to earn our trust and I think that was what this thing was all about: trust. We’ve won 19 games now, we’re one away from 20, and I’m really really excited about going to the Pac-12 Tournament and the way we’re playing.”
The team will be facing Washington State at 6 p.m. at KeyArena in Seattle for the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament on Thursday. The tournament’s second round begins on Friday. If the Trojans beat the Cougars, they will face Stanford next.

The Trojans took down the Loyola Marymount Lions 3-2 as junior shortstop Chase Bushor hit a go-ahead solo shot late in the eighth inning.

The Trojans entered their game against the Lions with confidence after sweeping the Villanova Wildcats over the weekend to extend their winning streak to six victories in a row. On the other hand, the Lions’ season has gone quite differently as they came into this game with a record of 1-6. However, despite their record, the Lions have kept all of their games close this season.
The Trojans got off to an early lead in the first inning. Junior second baseman Brandon Perez got the inning started as he hit a double into center field with two outs, and junior first baseman Dillon Paulson soon followed that with a single to drive home Perez. The Trojans only managed to score one run in that inning, but the hitting did not stop there. 
In the second inning, the Trojans had two runners on first and third with junior left fielder Lars Nootbaar up to bat with two outs. Nootbaar, who leads the NCAA in walks and walks per game, hit a hard ground ball into second, and the second baseman made a great diving play to get Nootbaar out at first and save a run. In the third, the Trojans also left runners in scoring positions, however, but also unable to put runs on the board.
Meanwhile, the Lions couldn’t get their bats going in the first two innings as senior pitcher Mason Perryman looked comfortable on the mound through the first two. However, in the third inning, Perryman walked right fielder Kenny Oyama who then stole second to get himself into scoring position. Afterward, infielder Nick Sogard hit a single into right-center field allowing Oyama to score. Sogard then stole second with two outs to get himself into scoring positions, but Perryman then struck out infielder Niko Decolati as the inning ended with one run apiece. Throughout the game the Lions looked for every opportunity they had to steal a base and get runners into scoring positions.
Head coach Dan Hubbs soon made a pitching change, bringing on freshman pitcher Brian Gursky in the fourth inning. He managed to get the next three batters out with relative ease, keeping the Lions at one run through four innings of play.
The Trojans great defensive play helped them get out of a tough fifth inning. With two runners on first and second and one out, a ball was hit to shortstop Bushor, who was able to make a play at second. Then Perez was unable to turn his throw to first into a double play, however, the Lions took an aggressive baser unning approach, sending their runner on third home, and first baseman Dillon Paulson made the throw to home to get the runner out and save a run. Prior to this game, the Trojans actually led the nation in fielding percentage, .996, with only one error allowed in their first seven games. 
USC then followed that great defensive inning with some strong offense, drawing a couple of walks, and eventually ended up scoring a run courtesy of redshirt junior infielder Angelo Armenta’s  sacrifice fly into deep center field with bases loaded, scoring Perez. That run gave them a 2-1 lead entering the sixth inning. 
In the top of seventh, the Lions were finally able to score with runners on base as first baseman Jamey Smart singled into left-center with runners on first and third right after coach Hubbs sent junior pitcher Brad Wegman to the mound. Eventually, the Trojans turned a double play to close the top of the seventh. The Trojans then were unable to capitalize with two runners in scoring positions as the score became 2-2 going into the eighth.
The Trojans kept the Lions quiet in the top of the eighth and were able to capitalize with a big inning to take the lead. Bushor came up huge when he drove a ball deep into left field for a go-ahead home run to retake the lead 3-2 before going into the ninth.
Sophomore pitcher Connor Lunn came into the game for the Trojans to close out the ninth inning. He looked impressive as he closed the game with three strikeouts in the ninth inning. The Trojans managed to win the nailbiter with the scoreline of 3-2 as their record improved to 7-1 on the season.
“At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how we won, as long as we won,” Hubbs said. “I was proud of the guys. It’s not easy to win in Southern California on a Tuesday night. It’s just not. And you know everybody’s just kind of using guys that anybody they have available. So you don’t get to see a starter for six or seven innings necessarily so it’s not easy to get a hit.” 
The Trojans face a tough matchup in their weekend series as they face off against the fifth-best team in the country, the Arkansas Razorbacks, at Baum Stadium.

This Sunday, Los Angeles Football Club begins its inaugural MLS season. They will face the defending Western Conference champions the Seattle Sounders, in a highly anticipated matchup.
Trevor Denton | Daily Trojan
In many ways, this is the absolute perfect time for a new MLS to hit the Los Angeles market. Longtime league poster-boys LA Galaxy (located in Carson) are becoming increasingly irrelevant. They captured championships in 2011, 2012 and 2014, but have struggled immensely since American soccer icon Landon Donavan initially retired. Last season, they finished dead last in the MLS standings, the club’s worst finish by a wide margin. Since being founded in 1996, they built up a reputation for bringing in top flight talent from around the world, such as David Beckham, Robbie Keane and, of course, Donavan. Now, their roster resembles that of a U-20 team. 
If LA Galaxy continues slumping, LAFC should be able to immediately capture the hearts of fans in the area with relative ease. It certainly helps that in terms of interest, the MLS is popping right now. In their debut season last year, Atlanta United FC shattered attendance records (they sold out football stadiums!) and produced exciting soccer. Now, everybody from Beckham, who is helping fund a new team in Miami set to kick off in 2019 or 2020, to world famous DJ Diplo,  a partial owner of Phoenix Rising, which is a club hoping for an MLS bid in the near future, wants a piece of the pie. 
With the future of American football becoming increasingly blurry due to safety concerns, numerous business people and celebrities are investing in soccer teams for cheap, expecting it to become the country’s next major sport. LAFC, with its high profile ownership group featuring Will Ferrell and Magic Johnson, is a by-product of this trend. 
And they will undoubtedly generate buzz during its first season. Their roster likely won’t win any championships in the near future, but it should produce plenty of excitement. Mexican national team forward Carlos Vela will generate the most headlines as the team’s highest profile acquisition. Don’t confuse him for a typical big-name MLS import past his prime, however. At 28 years old, Vela still has quality soccer left in him and after bouncing around the English Premier League and La Liga (Spain’s top flight league), the MLS presents a chance for him to finally carve out a lasting legacy. Expect him to be more like Toronto’s Sebastian Giovinco (he won the MVP award in 2015 after arriving from Italy) than, say, New York City FC’s Frank Lampard (he arrived well past his prime and retired after just 29 appearances). His abilities combined with his appeal to L.A.’s Mexican community should make him an instant fan favorite. 
In addition to Vela, LAFC also possesses some exciting young players. Portuguese defender Joao Moutinho was selected No.1 overall in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft and he brings limitless potential with his ability to cross and even score from the left-back spot. Joining him is highly touted 19-year-old Diego Rossi, a Uruguayan forward who will likely end up competing in Europe sooner rather than later. 
Leading Vela, Moutinho, Rossi and others will be Bob Bradley. The long-time head coach has been everywhere; he coached in the MLS’s first ever season, led the U.S. Men’s National Team for five years (from 2006-11) and became the first American to manage an English Premier League team in 2016, even if it was the shortest stint in the competition’s history. Now, he will embark on yet another exciting project: making sure LAFC starts off on the right foot in its first season. 
LAFC possesses the roster, coach, front office and infrastructure to be a successful MLS club. When their brand new $350 million Banc of California Stadium opens its doors on April 21, expect there to be a packed crowd and palpable excitement. 
But, for LAFC, the real test will come after their first season when they are no longer Los Angeles’ shiny, new sports team. In a market where NFL teams ironically struggle to fill up soccer venues (the Chargers played the 2017 season in StubHub Center, the LA Galaxy’s home), LAFC may have problems gaining a lasting fan base unless it produces winning seasons right away. 
For now, LAFC has its city’s attention. Keeping it will be the much more difficult part.
