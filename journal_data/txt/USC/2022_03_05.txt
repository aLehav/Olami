For the fans Saturday night, every bucket was life or death. Pauley Pavilion transformed into a library when USC scored, and in a matter of mere seconds, you would have thought you were at the Rose Bowl after UCLA hit a shot. 
It was the first time fans occupied the stadium for a USC vs. UCLA game since early 2020, and the deafening crowd noise made that all the more obvious. 
No matter how much the Trojans did to claw back in the game, a Bruin bucket felt like a complete reset. No. 17 UCLA defeated No. 16 USC 75-68, winning for the first time in the last six matchups between the crosstown rivals.
“It was a back and forth game, it was chaotic,” junior forward Isaiah Mobley said. “It was up and down, and our mistakes gave them the W.”
USC fought its way back into the game multiple times in the second half, unwilling to let UCLA close the game comfortably. After trailing by as much as 13 with more than five minutes to play, the Trojans went on a 12-1 run to reduce the lead to just 2 with a minute and a half to go.  
“I just kept telling the guys ‘Believe, believe, believe,’” Mobley said. “That’s all you can do is believe. If we give up, then we know we’re gonna lose for sure.”
The weight of a persistent UCLA offense and continual pressure from the crowd got to USC. Despite multiple late missed free throws, the Bruins held on. 
Junior forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. was determined to right his wrongs from the last matchup, where he shot 2-of-11 against the Trojans at Galen Center. On the Bruins’ turf, Jaquez Jr. came out of the gates hot, using an arsenal of pull-up jumpers and contested layups to finish with 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting. 
Senior guard Jules Bernard provided timely offense as well, with a 19-point performance on 6-of-11 shooting. 
“You start helping on [Jaquez Jr.], then [Bernard] hits a corner three,” Mobley said. “You tip your hat to them for making some tough ones, and also the open ones.” 
For the Trojans, leading scorer Mobley missed the Feb. 12 matchup at Galen Center against the Bruins. His rivalry-game return alleviated some stress for the USC offense, posting 20 points and 8 rebounds. 
The other usual scorers played their part as well. Senior guard Drew Peterson came alive in the second half, and junior guard Boogie Ellis, who couldn’t buy a bucket against UCLA last time out, found his flow on offense. The pair combined for 26 points, 15 of which came in the second half, keeping USC afloat.
“We’ve had a lot of experience in close games, and we’re comfortable if it is close down the stretch,” Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “I thought that we were gonna have a chance … [The loss] wasn’t because we weren’t playing hard, and we played together tonight.”
The biggest failure for the Trojans came in the turnover battle, and the Bruins capitalized on just about every mistake. USC coughed the ball up 15 times, lending to 21 points off turnovers for UCLA. The Bruins themselves had just 1 turnover. 
“One turnover is a low number in a college basketball game,” Enfield said. “They did a really good job of … not getting sped up, and they took care of the basketball … Turnovers are part of the game, and [we] can’t have 15, especially on the road.”
The Trojans finish their regular season with a program-record 25 wins. They will travel to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 Tournament, where they’re slated to face the winner of No. 6 seed Washington and No. 11 seed Utah.  
“The Pac-12 Tournament and the NCAA Tournament are new seasons,” Enfield said. “You throw your records out when you get to Vegas … We know what’s at stake.”

A preliminary hearing for the criminal trial of former USC gynecologist George Tyndall, scheduled for Friday at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center, was rescheduled to a later date — tentatively May 13. 
Following complaints and reports beginning in the 1990s that Tyndall engaged in sexual misconduct with his patients — many of whom were USC students — at the Engemann Student Health Center, he pleaded not guilty to 35 felonious charges brought by the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office. Charged with 23 counts of unlawful penetration and 12 counts of sexual battery, Tyndall was the perpetrator in more than 18,000 reports of sexual abuse. If convicted of all charges, he could expect 64 years of imprisonment.
Tyndall was dismissed from practicing at the University in 2016 following a nurse’s report of his inappropriate behavior to a campus rape crisis center. Tyndall’s medical license was suspended three months after his arrest in June 2019, though it was temporarily suspended in 2018 following the Los Angeles Times’ investigation into Tyndall’s recurrent misconduct against patients. 
The investigation also found that, despite receiving reports of Tyndall’s wrongdoing, the University failed to immediately inform the Medical Board of California. In 2018, the USC Board of Trustees hired law firm O’Melveny & Myers to investigate the allegations; however, the report was never released.
Judge Larry Paul Fidler presided over a preliminary hearing for Tyndall’s case held at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center Nov. 30, during which two students — Jane Doe #14 and Jane Doe #16 — testified against Tyndall, speaking to the details of the sexual abuse they experienced as patients. Insured by USC Student Health, both students were limited to treatment at Engemann, where they said the finite number of women practitioners meant they could only schedule gynecology appointments with Tyndall. 
The University reached two separate settlements connected to the Tyndall case: an $852 million settlement in response to civil cases filed by the Los Angeles Superior Court to 710 women and a federal class-action lawsuit compensating individuals who received women’s health services from Tyndall. The latter entitled anyone who had been treated by Tyndall to receive $2,500 without disclosing the details of their interactions with him, totaling $215 million distributed to 18,000 women. With more than $1 billion paid, the settlement is the largest payout in response to sex abuse in the history of higher education.
Following Tyndall’s suspension and subsequent removal, USC expanded safety protocols, including rewriting sensitive exam policy, employing more women physicians in the gynecology department, expanding the Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention program and increasing accessibility to reporting potential misconduct and patient feedback.
Preliminary hearings only occur in felony cases and enable judges to assess whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that an offense was committed and that there is a reasonable possibility that the defendant committed the crime. 
Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller, Jr. expressed eagerness Friday to promptly proceed with the hearing process, as there are 17 more victims and other witnesses yet to testify. 
No trial date has been set for Tyndall’s case.
