Departing USC senior tight end Anthony McCoy tested positive for marijuana use in an NFL-sanctioned drug screening at the NFL combine, FoxSports.com reported late Sunday.
McCoy, who was projected to be a mid- to late-round draft prospect, reportedly told teams several weeks ago of the positive result, hoping that honesty would be the best option in the situation.
Each year a confidential list of failed tests from the combine are distributed to the teams, but McCoy’s agency, Priority Sports and Entertainment attempted to preempt the report.
In McCoy’s senior season, the California-native caught 22 passes for 457 yards and one touchdown before an ankle injury slowed him down during the later half of the season.
Many prospects have tested positive for banned substances at the combine in the past and have still seen their draft stocks remain unaffected.
Defensive end Luis Castillo admitted to using steroids before the 2005 draft and was still selected in the first round of the draft by the San Diego Chargers.
Fox Sports revealed that Georgia Tech running back Jonathan Dwyer’s also failed the drug screening at the combine.
Nice blog! Thanks a lot for sharing this information. I got some good information that is In McCoy’s senior season, the California-native caught 22 passes for 457 yards and one touchdown before an ankle injury slowed him down during the later half of the season. Thank you

The USC men’s volleyball team clinched the sixth seed in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament next weekend by sweeping its two games this weekend.
The Trojans squeaked by No. 14 UC San Diego 3-2 Friday and then swept No. 10 Long Beach State 3-0 Saturday to end the regular season, winning five out of its last six games.
The Trojans (16-10, 13-9 MPSF) had a relatively easy time with the 49ers (12-17, 8-14) as they were never really challenged late in any of the three sets. The Trojans won 30-25, 30-25, 30-23, and the closest Long Beach came to winning any of those sets was within two points of the Trojans at 23-21 in the second set before USC pulled away.
Junior setter Riley McKibbin spread the ball around as four players had eight kills or more. Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy led the team with 16 en route to obtaining a .400 hitting percentage, and sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli got in double digits with 11 kills.
As expected, junior outside hitter Tri Bourne sat out this weekend with a broken left thumb. The Trojans hope to have him back for the playoffs, but in the meantime, senior Tyler Stevens started in his place and had a solid contribution of eight kills, five digs and four blocks.
USC’s game against UCSD (10-19, 5-16) was a little tighter. The Trojans won, but they had to come from behind to do so en route to a 26-30, 30-21, 30-23, 26-30, 18-16 score.
The Tritons actually had three match points in the fifth set as they took a 14-11 lead. But thanks to a service error, a mishit and a kill from sophomore Tony Ciarelli, USC evened the score at 14. The Trojans saved another match point shortly after at 15-14 and then, after having one match point of their own, put the game away on a mishit by UC San Diego.
Again, four players had eight kills or higher as Troy and Ciarelli led the way with 23 each. Eight of Troy’s kills came in the crucial fifth set, including the one that saved a match point at 14-15.
The Trojans controlled the second and third sets and weren’t out of the first and fourth set until the final point was recorded. In the first set, the game was tied at 23 when UCSD went on a four-point run to put it away. Then in the fourth set, USC closed to 25-27 but a couple of kills by the Tritons and a mishit by Ciarelli saw UCSD send it into a deciding fifth set.
The Trojans will now play at Cal State Northridge, the third seed, in the MPSF tournament starting Saturday. USC lost to the Matadors 3-2 and 3-1 this season.

The No. 16 USC women’s tennis team dropped a 6-1 decision to No. 7 UCLA on Friday afternoon in a crucial Pac-10 conference showdown for both teams at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.
With Friday’s loss, the Women of Troy (13-8, 5-2) are eliminated from the Pac-10 title contention.
UCLA (19-3, 6-1) came out strong, snagging a doubles sweep to start the day off. The Bruins secured an 8-5 win at No. 2 as UCLA’s No. 77-ranked duo of Noelle Hickey and Nina Pantic topped sophomore Alison Ramos and freshman Valeria Pulido.
Meanwhile, the other two matches on courts one and three remained close. At the third court, USC’s duo of senior Sarah Fansler and junior Lyndsay Kinstler evened the score after being down 1-3, but couldn’t complete the comeback and fell 9-7.
The doubles point was already secured when the match on court one was tied 6-6. From there, UCLA No. 4 pair of Andrea Remynse and Yasmin Schnack put away USC’s No. 55 duo of freshman Danielle Lao and junior Maria Sanchez 8-6.
With UCLA up 1-0 heading into singles, the Bruins held the momentum and managed to claim the first set on five of six courts, en route to taking three consecutive singles matches to seal their victory.
USC was held to straight-set losses on the back two courts, putting UCLA ahead 3-0, and just one victory away from taking the match from its crosstown rival.
No. 24 Ramos was the only player for USC to take the first set from her Bruin opponent, as she cruised to 6-1 on court three over No. 51 Hickey. Ramos beat Hickey in straight sets the last time the teams met.
But Ramos couldn’t keep up this time and ended up winning just two games for the remainder of the match. Hickey posted a 1-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory over Ramos, which gave UCLA the 4-0 lead as well as the secured match.
USC earned its sole point of the day with an impressive comeback victory on court four by No. 100 Pulido. Pulido lost the first set rather quickly at 0-6, but won the next two sets in hard-fought tiebreakers.
The No. 3 singles player in the nation, USC’s Sanchez was topped by No. 8 Schnack on the first court. Sanchez seemed like she had the upper hand after going up 5-0 in the first set. But from there, Schnack won seven straight games to edge out Sanchez in the first set 7-5. Schnack also won the next set and notched another 7-5 in the second set.
The No. 3 match was still under way with UCLA’s No. 26 Remynse and USC’s No. 28 Lao competing in the final singles match of the day. Lao was hoping to avenge her loss to Remynse from earlier this season. Remynse had taken that match clinching point in three sets, when the teams were tied 3-3, which had given the Bruins the win.
But yet again, it was Remynse who snagged the victory, polishing off Lao 7-5, 6-1 to close out the match for a dominant 6-1 win for the Bruins.
“It was a really tough loss. We were very disappointed, but we know we all tried our best,” Pulido said. “Now, we are just trying to move on and stay positive. We need to stay focused. We can’t let this loss affect our performance for next week.”
The Women of Troy head to Ojai, Calif., this week for individual singles and doubles action at the Pac-10 championships. First, they will get to finish their match versus No. 10 Stanford on Wednesday at 11 a.m. Their April 2 match was suspended because of rain.
If Stanford wins, the Cardinal will improve to 8-0 and capture the Pac-10 crown. If USC wins, UCLA must face No. 12 California as its April 2 match was also cancelled by rain. If the Bruins win, then it will share the Pac-10 title with Stanford.
“We still have a lot left of the season,” Sanchez said. “Everyone is going to go into Ojai working on their game and trying to best prepare themselves for the upcoming NCAAs.”

The USC Graduate School has announced the creation of a program that both encourages and serves as a symbol of innovation.
New ideas · The USC Stevens Institute of Innovation is partnering with the USC Graduate School to offer a new diploma in innovation. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan 
Beginning in the fall, graduate students will be able to earn a Ph.D. diploma in innovation through the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation. The program is the first of its kind and is meant to complement students’ disciplinary work with practical skills.
The program will be free for all Ph.D. students at USC and consists of 12 units leading to a Certificate in Innovation. Participants must maintain a 3.0 GPA and pass a qualifying exam.
The courses offered include The Innovation Process: Development, Diffusion and Leadership (GRSC 610), Legal Issues and Financing of Innovation (GRSC 612) and Disciplinary Perspectives in Innovation (GRSC 615). The 12-unit structure of the program allows Ph.D. students to still focus on their disciplinary work while gaining experience in innovation.
The idea for the certificate originally came from Executive Vice President and Provost C. L. Max Nikias. A group of faculty members, led by Jean Morrison, a professor of earth sciences and vice provost for academic affairs and graduate programs, then began to formulate a curriculum and to develop courses and syllabi. The entire process took almost a year.
Morrison said she thinks it is important for Ph.D. students to take classes in areas outside of their specialization and learn to think in different ways.
“I think, historically, Ph.D. education has tended to focus inward and to remain very disciplinary in nature,” Morrison said. “[The program] is meant to provide these students with a different way of looking at their disciplinary work, hoping that they’ll bring out the innovative side of whatever it is they’re going to do.”
Further, she hopes the new program will help Ph.D. students find ways to make their knowledge applicable to society.
The program, Morrison said, is the first innovation degree in the country.
“This is, as far as we know, a completely unique and new program that we don’t think exists in this configuration anywhere else,” she said.
The program has already attracted many inquiries.
“We are anticipating it being very selective,” said Nicole Hawkes, associate provost of academic affairs and the program manager of Women in Science and Engineering. “I think there’s already been tremendous interest. The program was announced on Monday and already has had a dozen inquiries from students and other faculty members.”
Z ShiHeng Guan, a graduate student studying computer science, heard of the program recently and said many graduate students are excited for the new diploma.
“They will get excited about how it’s free, and I think it will be useful,” Guan said.

Business professionals from all around the world will descend upon USC on Monday for the start of the 23rd annual Asia/Pacific Business Outlook conference, which is aimed at educating American business professionals about trade and investment opportunities in Asia.
More than 150 business professionals will participate in the conference, which is being hosted by USC’s Center for International Business Education and Research. The two-day conference will feature seminars conducted by more than 60 business experts from Asia and will offer private appointments with U.S. government commercial counselors from embassies in Asia.
Richard Drobnick, director of CIBER, said it is important for American businesspeople to be well acquainted with the economy in Asia.
“These are the markets that have been growing the fastest over the past 20 years, so to get American people to connect with experts in the field will be very beneficial,” Drobnick said.
The conference is a unique opportunity, Drobnick said, because it gives businesspeople the chance to meet in person with experts from around the world.
“By talking to the experts we bring, [participants] have an advantage because they know what they’re looking for and who they’re looking for,” Drobnick said. “There’s information the experts have that’s typically not available in newspapers, magazines or websites; it’s personal information.”
Shantanu Dutta, vice dean for graduate programs and research at the USC Marshall School of Business, said he also thinks this is a good opportunity for American business professionals.
“The idea is to create a better understanding of how to do business in the Asia Pacific and USC Marshall has very extensive business connections in the area,” Dutta said. “It provides opportunities for people who want to learn on different topics, connect with people in expertise and to just network.”
This year’s conference is focused on sustainability issues. It is the first time the conference has had a theme.
“With climate change and changing rules and regulations around the world, we thought that American businesspeople should become aware of these new sustainability opportunities in Asia,” Drobnick said.
Mehran Matloubian, a chief strategy officer from Topanga Technologies who will be attending the conference for the first time Monday, said he hopes to better understand how to export his product to various Asian countries and conduct business by attending the conference.
“The conference provides a unique opportunity to meet and talk with trade specialists based in several Asian countries in one location,” Matloubian said.
CIBER has been at USC since 1990 and is one of 31 centers nationwide funded by the Department of Education. The center at USC has won six competitions and brought $8 million to USC for research.
Drobnick said this conference is a “non-trivial” way to raise the reputations of USC and Marshall. He said it indirectly increases USC student applications from parents who want their children to think that Asia’s business is important to American business people, and it also brings research money to Marshall from some of the companies who participate.
“It demonstrates that USC is a source of learning about business opportunities in Asia; it demonstrates that to the whole world,” he said.

Expectations were high for this year’s Earth Week, which kicks off Monday, but organizers at USC say they lacked the resources and support to hold an event of the magnitude they had hoped.
This is only the second year USC has celebrated Earth Week as an organized event, but, nationwide, the awareness week is in its 40th year.
Sustainability Program Manager Matthew Oden said many people had high hopes for USC’s Earth Week this year, but it did not come together as planned.
“We do realize that there were a lot of expectations from the community, given that this year marks Earth Week’s 40-year anniversary, but right now we don’t have a lot or resources or manpower to make very extensive efforts,” Oden said.
Because there is no staff or budget for Earth Week, Oden said it was difficult to coordinate the event. At this point, there is no complete schedule of events, and organizers are not sure if there are events every day.
Some events, however, have been coordinated, through the efforts of student groups, including USC’s Net Impact Environmental Business Club and California Public Interest Research Group. The groups have arranged to have vendors on Trousdale Parkway selling eco-friendly products Thursday — including compact fluorescent lightbulbs and canvas bags — and are hosting a guest speaker and a flash mob.
The green flash mob, organized by CalPIRG, will take place at Tommy Trojan on Tuesday and feature dozens of students wearing green and blue shirts lying down in the shape of the earth, along with one student dressed as a smokestack to symbolize the harmful effect of pollution on the planet.
Guest speaker Dick Lowry of Blue Oak Energy will come to campus Wednesday to discuss the effectiveness of solar energy in the battle against global warming. Lowry, a USC alumnus and director of business development at Blue Oak Energy, will also talk about his company’s approach to alternative energy.
Kathryn Jacobsen-Majer, a sophomore majoring in political science and the incoming director of operations for USC Net Impact, said she hopes these events will encourage students to think more about sustainability and the environment.
“Our main goal here is awareness,” she said. “There’s so much we can be doing, both to make this a bigger event at USC and to promote alternative energy. We need to mobilize to get people more interested and involved.”
Net Impact, a global student organization that promotes sustainable non-profit business practices, is currently aiming to get at least 1,000 signatures on a petition to bring more alternative energy to USC, add more recycling units and LEED certify all buildings.
The event will also feature an Eco-Fair, coordinated by Alan Kita, the budget/business analyst for USC TRIO Programs. Kita said, next year, USC hopes to collaborate with organizations that currently employ unsustainable practices to demonstrate the process of becoming an eco-friendly business. For now, however, USC’s Earth Week has limited resources and is unable to make such extensive efforts.
“This year, we’re just happy to have people come out and enjoy themselves, and maybe come away from the Earth Week events with a little more consciousness about the environmental impact of what they do, buy and wear,” Kita said.
Groups such as USC Net Impact and CalPIRG hope that the 2010 Earth Week events will pique student interest and get more people involved so Earth Week at USC can become a more comprehensive event in the future.
“I think Earth Week is just another event for most people,” said Stephanie Ashley, a freshman majoring in earth sciences and creative writing. “But the environment is something that we’re affecting all the time; we should all learn more about how to protect it.”
Richard Wei, a volunteer student coordinator for Earth Week, agreed.
“Like a New Year’s resolution, environmental sustainability is about more than just a day or even a week,” he said. “We want Earth Week to encourage people to think about the planet in everything they do.”

In grade school, it is not uncommon for one student to bully another. It is so commonplace that school officials often turn a blind eye to the tormenting and let it go unpunished. We are far beyond the days when chastisement and a pat on the hand would suffice.
On Jan. 14, 2010, a Massachusetts teenager committed suicide by hanging. Phoebe Prince was a recent immigrant to America from Ireland and was only 15 years old when her life was cut short. America is supposed to be the country where dreams come true; for Prince,  the victim of vicious bullying, America was a place of nightmares.
We, as Trojans, hold the power to change the course of the lives we lead and the lives around us. It might never be possible to stop bullying in schools; however, it is possible to make it known that bullying is wrong. If we are volunteering in the community and see children picking on others on the playground, it is our responsibility as members of the Trojan Family to report the bullying or stop it ourselves.
USC students volunteer over 700,000 hours of community service during a single school year. Many of those hours are spent in elementary, middle and high schools. Massachusetts might seem distant from our California lifestyle, but bullying is all around us in the schools where we spend our time.
What happens if the next suicide-related death reported all over the news takes place in our surrounding neighborhood?
What happens if it is a student you worked with who killed himself because of the torment and teasing at his school?
What could we, as student leaders, do to stop this?
Bullying might be a very common phenomenon; nonetheless, action must be taken to stop it. Parents either ignore the complaints of their children or are met with indifference from school officials when they bring it up. School administrators take no action because either the bullying isn’t reported or they don’t have a way to punish it in their disciplinary system. Peers don’t speak up to either or they turn a blind eye to the torment. It is a vicious circle of inaction.
Peer inaction is as much a cause of a fellow student’s unhappiness as is the bullying itself. It is the responsibility of students to stand up against students tormenting each other. The words of adults mean nothing compared to the approval and feedback from fellow students. If Prince’s peers would have come to her aid against the torment that she was experiencing at school and online, then she might still be alive today.
By taking a few minutes to stop the torment, you could be saving a life. It’s possible that Prince never had someone who was willing to stand up for her and tell her tormentors that what they were doing was “uncool” or “messed up.” She never had someone report the abuses, and she never really had a chance at life. Her peers were as much accomplices to her death as her tormentors were the cause.
As volunteers, we should encourage students to stand up for others, not just because you would want them to do the same for you but because doing so might save a life.
Melanie Mathis is a sophomore majoring in political science.
The solution is probably homeschooling.
Good Job Melanie! We need stop bullying and let kids know they are safe!
The same kind of cycle of inaction is really perpetrated in American society in all forms, from our very own government imposing ‘democracy’ in other countries, or it’s IMF sanctions etc.  The violence undertaken here affects us on a micro level.  If we weren’t so quick to take violent action toward another country and actually have alternate means of foreign policy, then American society would probably reflect a similar sentiment altogether.  It’s not a ‘softer’ approach but smarter in the end.  
Perhaps the solution is not to take violent means like My Bodyguard suggests, but (depending highly on the situation – may be physical chastisement, or verbal) to really consider ourselves as Mentors/role models whenever we our volunteering in the community, and everywhere for that matter.  Most often our volunteer efforts aid those who seek the help; most often these students may not be the perpetrators of the bullying.  Yet, it’s not difficult to speak to the power of words to dispell an altercation when we see it.
is that cowards talk smack behind your back. Then nobody wants to take your side. You become a loner because people are afraid of you, even if the good people can see the good in you. My middle school years were like this. I was a pretty good brawler with this being an understatement, and no one dared  to pick a fist fight with me again. But I was lonely because I didn’t let a bully pull my punk card.  
My practical solution: develop in you excellent cardiovascular conditioning and join a boxing club. 
 “Talking it out” or “turning the other cheek” just perpetuates the bullying. “Modern psychology” and the likes are just as futile. Sometimes, you got get ghetto with it to get respect; you gotta put your fist in.
I totally agree with you Melanie. But why didn’t you offer some practical solutions to stop bullying?
In our high-tech information age, communication is instantaneous and abstract. I’m talking about Facebook and the likes. I read about that poor girl Phoebe Prince in the LA Times, and believe it started with ugly rumors on Facebook about her dating some guy.
I agree with you that parents, school authorities, and sadly, society in general, brush these kinds of incidents off as growing pains or rites of passages. I disagree. People are aloof and don’t want to become involved. It’s because these same people are socially inept themselves, and don’t grasp the delicate 
I know from personal experience, that someone tried to bully me, I beat him up. No, I don’t carry myself around like a toughguy with chip on my shoulder. But what happens after you beat up a bully i

UCLA defeated the USC men’s tennis team for the first time this season 4-3, preventing the Trojans from claiming an outright Pac-10 title. The Trojans (19-3, 5-1) will instead share the crown with No. 7 Stanford.
A win would have given USC its first three-match sweep of UCLA (14-6, 4-2) since 1987.
That said, the Pac-10 title isn’t what everything to the team.
“It’s not about the Pac-10, it’s just about beating UCLA,” USC coach Peter Smith said.
“USC isn’t remembered by winning Pac-10 titles. USC is remembered by winning national championships,” senior Robert Farah said.
To begin the match, USC surrendered the doubles point to UCLA.
The No. 5 tandem of Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson comfortably dispatched No. 19 Amit Inbar and Nick Meister 8-5, but USC lost the other two doubles matches in tiebreaking affairs.
UCLA’s Matt Brooklyn and Haythem Abid topped No. 61 sophomore Daniel Nguyen and freshman J.T. Sundling 9-8 (8-6), while Alex Brigham and Holden Seguso defeated USC’s juniors Peter Lucassen and Jaak Poldma 9-8 (7-5).
The Trojans are now 19-0 when winning the doubles point and 0-3 when dropping it this season.
“I feel like the doubles point definitely creates momentum. We had so many chances today to get it, but in the end we didn’t,” Farah said.
In singles play, No. 7 Farah painlessly leveled the match at 1-1 with a 6-1, 6-0 rout over No. 56 Meister. After UCLA struck back when No. 97 Inbar won 6-2, 6-1 over No. 125 Lucassen, USC’s No. 2 Johnson tied the match once again with a 6-2, 6-3 victory against No. 55 Brooklyn.
In the third singles match, No. 52 Abid got out to a quick 1-0 set lead over No. 100 Poldma 6-3. After Abid went up 5-2 in the second set, Poldma struck back to win five games in a row and clinch the third set.
“[Assistant coach Eric] Amend kept me in there and kept telling me the right things, and eventually [Abid] missed a few shots, and I came up with a few big points, so I got the break back,” Poldma said.
Poldma then won three more consecutively games to take a commanding 3-0 lead in the third set, and seemed he would knock off Abid with ease. He then began to suffer from leg cramps that left him limping gingerly between points and forced him to serve underhand. As a result, Abid won the next six games to take the match 6-3, 5-7, 6-3.
“After the cramps, I couldn’t serve and I couldn’t run, so it limited my arsenal quite a bit,” Poldma said.
One of the bright spots for USC in singles play was No. 88 Nguyen, who topped UCLA’s Seguso 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 in a rocky affair. The win extended Nguyen’s singles-match win streak to 12 and evened the match at 3-3.
In the deciding match, UCLA’s Maxime Tabatruong won the first set over senior Jason McNaughton 6-3. But McNaughton fought back in a tiebreaker to win the second set 7-6 (7-5). McNaughton went up 4-1 in the third set, but Tabatruong countered to win the final five games to seal the 4-3 overall victory for UCLA.
Despite the loss, team members saw the match as beneficial to the team as it enters postseason play.
“We’re a better team having lost to UCLA than not having played the match,” Smith said. “It hurts to lose, but we found out some information about our team, and we will be better for it at the NCAAs,” Nguyen agreed, saying, “This is just a stepping stone for our further success; it’s a good learning experience.”
The USC men’s tennis team will play next weekend at the Pac-10 championships in Ojai, Calif.

In the moments following another impressive victory Saturday afternoon, USC coach Jovan Vavic sat in his office overlooking McDonald’s Swim Stadium and declared that the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team was on a mission, poised and prepared to make up for its disappointing finishes in recent years.
Outgoing · Senior Alexandra Kiss recorded a hat trick during the final regular season home game of her career on Saturday against UCLA. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
The Women of Troy had lost to crosstown rival UCLA in the national championship game in consecutive seasons, and frustration was evident.
Eleven months removed from last year’s postseason tragedy, Vavic’s declaration came in response in large part, to the combined eight goals of seniors two-meter Kami Craig and drivers Alexandra Kiss and Kally Lucas that propelled the Women of Troy (19-1, 5-0) to a 14-5 victory over the visiting Bruins on an emotional Senior Day.
“Our team is determined,” Vavic said. “We know what happened last year. We’re a lot hungrier this season. Honestly, this team is just on a mission.”
If there was one thing the Women of Troy needed to do on Saturday, it was to crush the Bruins’ confidence by jumping out to an early lead, but at times that seemed easier said than done. Despite scoring on its second possession of the game, USC found itself trailing 2-1 six minutes into the first frame after two power play goals slid past senior goalie Tumua Anae.
“I have no idea why some of those things happen,” Vavic added. “I guess we were maybe a little tight in the beginning. We had some open shots, but we missed them.”
Even with their slow start, the Women of Troy got back on track quickly, tallying nine goals to build an insurmountable 11-2 mid-third quarter lead and thwart any attempt on the part of UCLA to take control of the contest.
“The name of the game is patience,” said junior two-meter Kristen Dronberger. “We didn’t force anything and just waited for the defense to make a mistake.”
Dronberger, who tallied the team’s initial two goals in the first period, helped USC find its offensive rhythm early on, but it was the seniors who made sure that the team would walk away with its 17th straight victory in hand.
Both Craig and Kiss, two of the longest tenured members of the team, recorded hat tricks in the final home game of their careers.
“There is nothing better than to play against our crosstown rival UCLA on Senior Day,” Craig said. “The whole time, that game felt like it was a one-goal game with so much excitement and energy. It’s just fun to see the team come out with so much energy and be so close.”
What makes this year’s edition of the rivalry different — USC also won 13-3 over UCLA earlier in the year — is a renewed focus on the part of Craig and company, especially on the defensive side of things.
“We had to maintain our focus throughout the game,” Craig said. “As soon as we scored our first goal in the second period, we just had to keep on with the momentum.”
Facing a potent Bruin offense, the Women of Troy, led by Anae, who finished with 14 saves on the afternoon, stifled UCLA for 32 minutes, holding them scoreless for much of the game.
With a road trip to Northern California on the horizon, the Women of Troy appear ready to build upon their most recent success.
“I like the progress we have made since the NorCal tournament earlier in the year,” Vavic noted. “I felt in the tournament, we were not a hungry group. We were not a determined group. Since then, I think that has clearly changed.”

Time for an update on basketball.
It’s been more than a month since the Trojans suited up for the final time this season — about 45 days since USC finished off the season by losing its final five games, each by 10 points or less.
Since then, the Trojans have been in and out of the news — hiring a couple assistant coaches, losing a key contributor, signing a controversial recruit and being charged with tampering.
The charge was dropped, but we’ll get to that later. In the meantime, there are plenty of other topics to discuss while we wait out the six-plus months until USC plays a meaningful basketball game again.
First, those assistant coaches. Early in March, USC coach Kevin O’Neill chose not to retain assistants Phil Johnson and Gib Arnold, who had been leftovers from the previous Tim Floyd administration. Then, O’Neill promoted strength and conditioning manager Tony Miller to an assistant spot, hired Dieter Horton and promoted long-tenured assistant Bob Cantu to associate head coach to fill out his assistant quota.
Arnold is now the head coach at the University of Hawai’i. Johnson signed on to be an assistant under Floyd at the University of Texas El Paso.
For a little background on the new guys, Miller has never been a coach — at any level. He played for O’Neill at Marquette and then played professionally in Europe for 12 years. Last year was his first year on staff at any institution, although many players did rave about him multiple times over the course of the season.
Horton has been a coach for a while, but never at the Division I level. He’s been regarded as one of the best junior college coaches in the nation for a while. With Horton, there’s a little bit of another story — he spent the last four seasons as the head coach at Antelope Valley College, which incidentally is the same school new USC signee DeWayne Dedmon currently attends
Dedmon is a 7-footer who has played only two seasons of organized basketball but reportedly picked up more than two dozen scholarship offers from schools around the nation.
Regarding the situation, Horton told WeAreSC.com last year of the Dedmon-USC connection: “He loves [O’Neill]. He’s been down there twice and very much enjoys it down there. He hasn’t made a decision yet, but I know he likes ’SC.”
Dedmon won’t enroll until January and won’t play until October 2011, but it won’t hurt to have his coach with him along the way as he develops.
Perhaps the biggest news of this offseason, though, came last month when the Los Angeles Times reported that USC forward Leonard Washington would transfer. Washington had been a fairly important player for the Trojans over the past two seasons, as a sixth man last season and an off-and-on starter during his freshman year.
But he never got along with O’Neill, and their conflicting attitudes apparently reached a breaking point near the end of the season. Washington was reportedly dismissed from the team following USC’s final game and is now searching for a school to bring his services to.
On that note, the Trojans look to be somewhat shorthanded in the 2010-2011 season, especially for the first few games when Fordham transfer Jio Fontan is still ineligible to compete. Once Fontan returns, USC will have a good amount of talent on its roster, as the Trojans will boast a mix of experienced and young players.
At guard, they’ll have redshirt senior Donte Smith and senior Marcus Simmons — and freshmen Maurice Jones and Bryce Jones. Neither Smith nor Simmons has been a long-term starter, and the Joneses might very well overtake them for key minutes this season.
In the frontcourt, they’ll have senior Alex Stepheson and junior Nikola Vucevic, both starters last season — and sophomores Davis Rozitis and Evan Smith and freshmen Curtis Washington and Garrett Jackson. Rozitis and Smith each played sparingly last season, putting them essentially on the same level as the incoming freshmen. Of anyone, Jackson might be the most important reserve on this year’s team.
Now, let’s not forget the whole tampering situation surrounding former Rutgers guard Mike Rosario, who went to high school with Fontan. Earlier this month, the Courier-News of New Jersey reported that Rutgers University was set to file tampering charges against the Trojans, regarding the recruitment and potential transfer of Rosario.
Thing is, it never happened. O’Neill immediately denied the report to the Orange County Register, and on Sunday, ESPN’s Andy Katz reported that Rutgers’ athletic director, Tim Pernetti, had apologized to O’Neill for the false charges. Rosario committed to Florida, by the way.
To recap: In the last 45 or so days, USC has replaced two experienced assistants with inexperienced ones, signed a high-potential recruit for the class of 2011 but lost a probable starter for next season and been charged with serious tampering allegations only to have them dropped.
Now we have to wait six months to see what it all means.

Assistant head coach Monte Kiffin is in constant motion at football practices. He roams around the field, stopping in at each defensive position group to offer a brief piece of advice. Then, he’s on to the next group of players.
Whatever he said to the defensive line Saturday worked.
Consistent · Redshirt junior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris recorded a sack and five tackles in Saturday’s scrimmage, a week after forcing quarterback Mitch Mustain to fumble and taking it back 50 yards. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The defensive line dominated Saturday’s scrimmage, which marked the halfway point of spring practice. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley finished with impressive statistics (21 of 30 passing for 291 yards and five touchdowns), but the day belonged to the big guys up front.
“The story of the day was the way the defense came out,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I thought they dominated up front. We couldn’t get the run game going.”
Last week, the offense had its way early in the scrimmage. On Saturday, the defense turned the tables. Barkley and redshirt senior quarterback Mitch Mustain found themselves backpedaling early and often in the face of relentless pressure from the front four. USC’s defensive line racked up six sacks and nine tackles for a loss in the scrimmage.
“We want to be the most dominant group on the field,” redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton said. “I think we showed that today. We had guys penetrating in the backfield; we had guys getting sacks left and right. Guys are really getting after it.”
A lot of the credit has to go to Monte Kiffin and new defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron. Horton said the new coaches have made an immediate impact.
“We love them all,” Horton said. “Right off the bat they came in and [set] up their philosophy. I feel like everyone’s starting to buy in, everyone’s taking it serious.”

On a day of dominating performances, Lane Kiffin said that sophomore defensive end Nick Perry stood out. Perry recorded four tackles for loss and three sacks on Saturday.
“We didn’t start [him] so to see him do that today was really good and he really responded today to that,” he said.
Lane Kiffin and the other coaches sat Perry because he had not been playing consistently. On one drive, Perry notched sacks on first and third down to force the offense off the field. Later in the scrimmage, the offense drove to the two-yard line before a sack pushed them back outside the 10.
For much of the scrimmage, an offensive line depleted by injuries was unable to keep the defense out of the backfield or get a push in the running game. USC gained just 110 yards on 49 carries, and a lot of that yardage came on long runs by redshirt senior running back Allen Bradford and redshirt junior Marc Tyler.
“Our running backs need to learn how to run the ball because we don’t have a clue right now what it takes to be a championship running team,” Lane Kiffin said.
Redshirt junior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris, defensive end junior Armond Armstead and redshirt senior defensive tackle Derek Simmons each recorded a sack in the scrimmage.
“I think everything that’s happening here with the new coaches is going to make us so much better in the long run,” Horton said.

Mustain completed 7 of 14 passes for 104 yards and an interception. Freshman running back Dillon Baxter left practice with an ice pack on his knee after tweaking it on Saturday. Senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson hurt his elbow during the scrimmage and sat out the rest of practice.

To most attendees, Coachella is strictly a music festival. But, as those who have attended know, the large-scale public art is half the reason to be there. Each year the creators of Coachella design environments compatible with the day’s desert heat and the night’s darkness and this year, the organizers have outdone themselves.
The Empire Polo Field that houses Coachella was an art installation in its own right with palm trees lining the parameter lit up with brightly different colors.
One consistent installation was the boxed light show outside of the Sahara tent. By day, a metal box gleamed in the sunlight, but by night, surface light bulbs pulsed to the music in a variety of colors projecting various patterns.
This year’s artistic centerpiece, “The Ascencion,” was a giant 45-feet tall solar origami crane located in the main stage arena. At night, solar-powered, color-changing LED lights illuminate the magnificent crane. As always, the Dew Lab was the place to be during the day.
With constant D.J. changes and misters pumping cool water onto the crowd, it was a great place to beat the heat. And at night, you could have caught some live entertainment as dancers fill the stage with tribal accessories and interpretive dancing, making music a secondary attraction for a short time.
In the middle of the field stood a large clear cylinder, which at night mystified its audience, and provided a tinge of heat. Between the smaller Mojave and Gobi tents sat two large pagodas covered in wind chimes.
What appeared to be ornaments only useful during the day actually lit up to provide a group meeting place at night. Spiked throughout the festival grounds were tall silver pod-like structures gleaming in the sun. But as the sky darkened, they cast a patterned light on the ground.
Near the polo field entrance sat large glass and metal pipes that sparkled when under direct sunlight. When you walked by these pipes you could hear them playing sounds much like a light melodic organ.
Though the art might take the second seat to the music for most of the the 80,000 people who attended Coachella this year,  the installations were as unique as ever, creating another visual feast to supplement the sonic pleasures that ran amok at Southern California’s largest music festival.

As the familiar neon sign of the Tower Hill Tube station glowed brightly against the backdrop of the setting sun, a male figure loomed ominously in the shadows. He wore a cavernous trench coat and a brown fedora, giving me the distinct impression that it had been lifted straight out of an Indiana Jones movie.
The darkness — coupled with the intermittent sprinkles and the howling wind — made the man, who managed to make the garb of an archaeological professor intimidating, appear as though I should rush back home and snuggle beneath my comforters.
It didn’t help that just minutes before I had dashed into a taxi to try and meet him on time, all along thinking that I was setting myself up to be spooked.
Wind-blown and with my stomach in knots, I looked around in a frazzled daze. A large group had already assembled around the mysterious figure, and as I neared, his face came into view. The menacing shadow-lurker turned out to be Donald, our guide on a Jack the Ripper walking tour.
Donald Rumbelow, upon closer inspection, is not the fearsome character I had aggrandized from afar. His monstrous size could be attributed to the plastic stool he stood on, and his sinister appearance was more from a lack of sleep and an overactive imagination than any real threat.
The anticlimactic buildup to our first encounter was the first of many that would continue throughout our two-hour journey.
That night, proudly resting atop his woolly, multicolored scarf was a prestigious Blue Badge, a fixture awarded by the Institute of Tourist Guiding that lent him additional credibility that had nothing to do with the bookish spectacles sitting on his face.
The process to become an official Blue Badge Guide in London is rigorous. Guides undergo training courses, that take approximately two years to complete. And that’s in addition to all the exams and mock tours they have to pass.
Rumbelow, having written two books on the infamous prostitute-murderer, is indeed very knowledgeable. But as he steered us a few steps to the side — centering our view squarely on the Tower of London — he prefaced his story by revealing that the building behind him had nothing to do with the Jack the Ripper murders.
With a somber look and an official tone, he told our group of about 50 to 60 walking enthusiasts that the fortress, known for a history of torture and gruesome executions, was just a theatrical backdrop for the violence to come.
From there, we moved outward through the cobbled streets on which Ripper committed his gruesome crimes. His name, a pseudonym describing the method in which he killed his victims, is attributed to a fake letter the media claimed to have been written by him. Despite its being based on a false source, however, the name stuck.
In 1888, Ripper was able to move between the City of London and Scotland Yard jurisdictions. In doing so, he evaded both forces by scattering the murders throughout each territory.
Because the two police forces were not allowed to investigate past their areas of authority, and they lacked the communication necessary for true cooperation, Ripper was able to pick up his victims wherever he pleased.
As we followed in Ripper’s footsteps, tracking back and forth between the invisible boundary lines, Rumbelow intertwined stories of the five murders — all East End prostitutes, most in their 40s — with a dramatic air, revealing the attitudes and ineptitudes of law enforcement at the time.
However, just as he began describing Ripper’s narrow escape from two incoming search parties, a heckler rode by on his bike shouting indecipherable obscenities, breaking the mood that Rumbelow had tried so hard to craft.
The highlight of the walk came when Rumbelow, while describing Jack the Ripper’s second victim in one night, asked for a volunteer. Silence seeped through the crowd, until a brave woman sporting a sleek ponytail and plastic-framed glasses offered her services.
In the confines of Mitre Square, he raised her hand high above her head and proclaimed, “This is the spot to where the body of Catherine Eddowes was found!”
Yet the streetlights shining brightly on the redeveloped buildings and the once narrow passageway widened to the width of a monster truck proved to be insurmountable barriers to imagining what was once a prostitute’s nightly haunt.
The story that ended the tour, however, was the account of Jack’s first victim, Polly Nichols, whose last known words as she confidently strolled out of the lodge house — a cheap hotel where many of the destitute stayed — were, “I’ll soon get my doss money! See what a jolly bonnie I’ve got now?”
Back in the 1880s, prostitutes were cheaper than one night at a lodge house, but Nichols believed her hat would attract enough customers to put her up.
She did manage to get the attention of a man. Unfortunately, that man was Jack the Ripper. And we all know how that ended up.
well written!

It isn’t every day that Orange County’s young 20-something art patrons crowd inside a steel storage container that could just as easily be carrying farming equipment on a cross-country freight train. But that was the scene Saturday night at The ARTery Gallery in Costa Mesa’s self-described “anti-mall” complex, The LAB.
Downtown · For the exhibit, artist John Bunney rendered the energy of West Coast city skylines, including Seattle (above) and Vancouver. - Photos courtesy of Kyle del Rosario 
The sight of art enthusiasts shuffling in and out of cramped industrial quarters should’ve been enough to raise a few eyebrows — if not for the fact that many of the exhibit visitors’ brows were pretty high to begin with — but the bulk of those in attendance at the opening reception for “Modern Day Expressionism” had been to previous shows at the peculiar gallery.
The new exhibition, a multimedia group exhibit showcasing the work of primarily local artists, was curated by intern-turned-gallery-assistant Roxana Vosough.
When recruiting artists to show at her exhibit, which sits in the heart of Costa Mesa’s South On Bristol Entertainment, Culture and Arts (SoBeCa) District, Vosough sent out an open call via e-mail. She also directly contacted a number of her coworkers at the Orange County Museum of Art in hopes of channeling the artistic sensibilities she believes are unique to the region.
“A specific genre of people come in here,” Vosough said of the novelty gallery. “It’s made by people who live in Orange County.”
Vosough, who studied art history as an undergraduate at UC Irvine, sought to localize the global trend of expressionism with her exhibit while also refining the meaning of contemporary art.
The decision to feature only art created within the window of the last decade, in addition to the on-site presence of a handful of the artists whose work was on display, contributed to a sense of immediacy and local significance that’s often absent from gallery shows.
Photography, acrylic painting, ink and watercolors as well as a piece that appeared to feature sand and crushed shells glued to a canvas, were all on display at the multimedia exhibit, which was arranged to benefit UNICEF.
Forty percent of the gross sales of all the art works sold will be donated to the child welfare-oriented organization, but some guests said the exhibit’s association with the charity didn’t figure very heavily into their decision to visit.
Chris and Kendra Bradley’s plans for the night didn’t originally involve international philanthropy, for instance, but that’s precisely what the couple ended up doing when they purchased John Bunney’s “Vancouver, Green.”
Chris Bradley, curator of a previous exhibit at The ARTery called “Board Stiff” — which highlighted surfers and skateboarders who also make art — is always eager to expose new people to the gallery and its mission.
“We came to support The ARTery,” Bradley said. “But [the show’s UNICEF affiliation] doesn’t stop us.”
Some of the artists whose work was on display were decidedly more enthusiastic about the show’s charitable component.
“I think it’s awesome,” said Tiffani Myers, an abstract photographer who had five pieces on display. “Art for a cause, basically.”
The bulk of the works showcased were abstractions of familiar subjects.
Albert Leinenweber found inspiration in a parking lot, for instance. Leinenweber, a graphic design student and graduate of CSU Long Beach, photographed puddles on an asphalt parking lot, which he later digitally manipulated to enhance the images’ color and make them less recognizable.
Photographer Reza Ardalan’s digital close-up of some of the mechanical components of an old tractor he saw on the side of the road was easily one of the most visually striking pieces of the exhibit. Ardalan said he pulled onto the shoulder of the road immediately after he saw how the discarded tractor’s features were enhanced by the natural light.
“The sun was just perfect — texture everywhere,” Ardalan said. He believes that an attentive artist can find his subject in the most unlikely places. “A junkyard can produce more beauty than a garden sometimes.”
Bunney, a security guard at OCMA who was one of the artists directly recruited by Vosaugh, showed five works at the gallery’s opening reception, two of which — “Seattle, Orange” and “Vancouver, Green” — are part of an ambitious larger series he’s currently working on.
“I’m doing the West Coast entirely,” Bunney said. “I’m trying to project the kind of energy that I feel within the city.”
Bunney’s geometric abstractions of the Pacific coastal cities’ familiar skylines were among some of the most expensive works for sale at the gallery. His depiction of San Francisco is complete, and Los Angeles and San Diego pieces are on the horizon.
With “Modern Day Expressionism,” Vosough appeared to succeed in what she set out to do. Her exhibit captured the perspectives of Orange Country artists and gave a number of unique variations on a theme. But Vosough entered the experiment with a sort of mental carte blanche by not expecting much in the way of cohesiveness.
“I know people’s tastes are really eclectic, but I think our generation’s tastes are struck by bright colors and unique perspectives, especially in photography,” Vosough said.
To that end, the show was a success. Vivid colors were in anything but short supply and unexpected angles abounded, especially in the photographic works that were shown.
To what extent the exhibit got a handle on the hard-to-pin-down genre of expressionism is a different story, but The ARTery’s newest exhibit was — if nothing else — a success in bringing together O.C. art lovers for a night of community and appreciation.

Your unique identity is the only thing that can never be taken away from you.
Even if it turns out you can’t find a job after college to pay off your tuition loans, even if you end up homeless on the streets around campus with all of your dreams dead and only a buck in your pocket, even if that too is stolen from you in a mugging — at least you will still have ownership of who you are. You are you. Say it aloud: I am me.
Relish the fact for a minute, because I’m about to take it away.
As crazy as it sounds, neuroscientists are discovering that the feeling of being oneself is a neural construct — an illusion.
“Despite all the pride that your self takes in its individuality and privacy, the only thing that separates you from me is a small subset of neural circuits in your frontal lobes interacting with mirror neurons,” wrote the well-known neurologist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran in an Edge Foundation article. If you tamper with these circuits, he explained, your sense of self begins to blend with those of other people.
In other words, the only reason you feel as though you have a distinct identity is because your prefrontal cortex — one of the most evolutionarily modern brain region — inhibits your mirror neurons, which are brain cells that fire not only when you do something but also when you see somebody else doing something.
For example, if you were to watch your chemistry professor burn his finger on a Bunsen burner, your brain activity would mimic his — as though you yourself were burning your finger. Some believe that mirror neurons are responsible for empathy.
Of course, you wouldn’t actually feel the pain your professor would feel. Your skin receptors would send messages to your brain indicating that everything is quite fine on their end. As a result, your prefrontal cortex would stop the output from your agitated mirror neurons so that you wouldn’t feel pain in your skin, even though you could still identify with your professor.
But here’s where things get interesting. Researchers have learned that if that system is disrupted somehow — say, by inhibiting the feedback from your skin receptors — then your sensory perceptions actually merge with other people’s.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
To return to the professor analogy: If your finger were anesthetized while you watched him burning his, then you actually would feel the pain in your anesthetized finger because your skin receptors would not be sending messages to your brain saying that they’re okay.
Ramachandran’s findings are supported by the fact that children, whose prefrontal lobes are not yet fully developed, often show an uncontrollable tendency to mimic the actions of others. The inclination survives into adulthood, but we are able to control ourselves with our developed prefrontal cortexes. You can probably recall various occasions where you were watching a football player at the Coliseum lurching forward for the ball, and you had to suppress your involuntary urge to move as he did.
The discovery that the self might not be a real, unitary entity is literally mind-blowing. It could plummet us into the black despair of the worst existential crisis ever known to man. But I think this research has extremely positive implications.
It‘s common for people to treat others negatively — especially in our society, where we are encouraged to be egotistical, to look primarily after our own needs. It is very easy to shut off the activity of our mirror neurons and feel detached from other people. Thus, we can hurt them, ignore their needs and be selfish.
If science proves that our identities are not as monolithic as we once thought they were — that in fact, our fields of study, favorite music, memories and other tastes have nothing to do with who we are — the human species could become a much kinder one. Selfish selflessness might replace survival of the fittest.
Many eastern religions, like Hinduism, advocate the belief in an all-permeating energy. Each distinct self is only a manifestation of this greater, universal identity, so that to hurt or think negatively of others is literally to hurt oneself.
This new research about the self seems to be compatible with that idea. Ramachandran hypothesized that when the circuits he described become hyperactive, “the result would be an intense heightening of the patient’s sensory appreciation of the world and intense empathy for all beings to the extent of seeing no barriers between himself and the cosmos — the basis of religious and mystical experiences,” he wrote. “You lose all selfishness and become one with God.”
Sure, the discovery that our previous concepts of self are false could mean we are smaller than we ever imagined. It could reduce each one of us to nothing. But it might mean that each one of us is everything: that each one of us has God inside, that we are all each other and that we are as large as the universe.

The USC basketball team might have escaped another potentially damaging situation — Rutgers Athletic Director Tim Pernetti apologized to USC basketball coach Kevin O’ Neill after accusing USC of tampering, according to ESPN’s Andy Katz. Katz released the information on his Twitter page.
The claim was in regard to Rutgers guard Mike Rosario, who asked to be released from the team so he could transfer. Rutgers claimed if they accepted Rosario’s request, he would not be permitted to attend USC.
Rosario, who led the Scarlet Knights in scoring over the past two seasons, does have ties to the Trojan basketball team. Jio Fontan, who transferred from Fordham to play basketball at USC, went to high school with Rosario. However, Katz reported that USC was never planning on trying to land Rosario.
Rutgers is in a time of transition, as ESPN’s Andy Katz reported current Rutgers coach Fred Hill was offered a buyout last week.
Rutgers never specified exactly what USC did to prompt the tampering claims.
This was not the first time the USC basketball program had to deal with serious accusations. In January, the team imposed sanctions that prevented the team from participating in both the Pac-10 and NCAA tournaments this past season. This punishment stemmed from claims that former player O.J. Mayo received improper gifts and benefits.
