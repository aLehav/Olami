“Students petition to remove fence” (Oct. 29) misquoted Katie Gavin as saying “We understand the USC administration that is in power will concede nothing. They aren’t forced to, but the idea is to gather enough students who care to sign and bring attention to the issue.” The quote should have read “We understand the USC administration that is in power will concede nothing they aren’t forced to. But, the idea is to gather enough students who care to sign and bring attention to the idea.” The article has been edited online to reflect this change.
The article also said Craig Keys spoke with “black clubs.” The article has been edited to reflect that Keys spoke with “block clubs.”

The USG Senate’s weekly meeting Tuesday evening included presentations from Diversity Affairs and the Philanthropy Fund. Because of a town hall co-hosted by USG at the same time, the meeting’s attendance was greatly reduced.
Lamar Gary, director of USG’s Diversity Affairs Committee, presented to the USG Senate. Among other issues, he stressed a need for diversity in student government.

“One of the things we’ve focused on is diversity in USG recruitment,” Gary said.
In order to achieve greater diversity in USG, Gary said he wants to move toward a “work flow” system for USG campaign financing, so qualified students can receive financial assistance to run for office in student government.
“As it stands right now, students have to pay up front when they apply for campaigning. We want to make sure that students who can’t afford this cost can have assistance,” Gary said.
Gary also spoke about a “rebuilding process” that he’s using to revitalize Diversity Affairs. Members of Diversity Affairs met with resource centers across campus and wrote one-page summaries of their policies and procedures. These documents will be used to update USG committee members on issues of diversity.
To strengthen membership in Diversity Affairs, Gary said he plans to give individual committee members “passion projects,” or personal goals they can work toward. These projects include forums or events to raise awareness.
“We’re teaching [committee members] to become inspired, and to advocate,” Gary said.
Yuna Kim, director of philanthropy funding, also presented.
Kim emphasized the success of the Pumpkin Party, an event co-sponsored by the Trojan Knights that gave local children an opportunity to carve pumpkins in preparation for Halloween.
“It was so cute to see little kids getting a chance to carve pumpkins,” Kim said. “Many of USC’s philanthropic events are based on an ongoing relationship with local organizations, so it’s important to foster relationships with the surrounding community.”

On Tuesday at the Galen Center, the City of Los Angeles’ Dept. of City Planning held a public workshop regarding the adoption of the Urban Design Guidelines and Jefferson Boulevard Concept Streetscape Plan.

The documents are a part of the appendences to be added to the Specific Plan and Development Agreement, with focus on Subarea 3, the territory that the University Village, Cardinal Gardens and Century currently occupy. The Specific Plan is an agreement on USC’s land use.
Though the Specific Plan was approved by the City Council in January 2013, the university and the Dept. of City Planning were required to further develop design goals to specifically address pedestrian and bicyclist linkages, connectivity on campus, access to open space and the newly constructed Expo line Metro station. The design goals, which will be up for adoption in the next few months, were presented at the public workshop. According to project manager Michelle Levy, after the workshop there will be a formal public hearing on Nov. 5 at the Galen Center and, from there, the guidelines will be reviewed by the City Planning Committee and then by City Council.
The Streetscape Plan regarding Jefferson Boulevard will allow for a more transit-supportive and bike and pedestrian-friendly space. According to the appendix document, on-street parking will be removed to configure a street with two westbound and two eastbound lanes. The sidewalks will be widened from approximately 10 feet to 14 feet. Seven-foot bike lanes will be added along the curb edge. Bike amenities, including lighting, benches, signage and bike racks will be installed. New trees will also be planted. All these improvements will be implemented in phases.
In conjunction with the Streetscape Plan, the Urban Design Guidelines cover the design of building facades, building massing, ground floor pedestrian access points and open spaces and landscaping.
“[The workshop] meeting is more of an open house,” said Haydee Urita-Lopez, a policy planner for the city. “It’s just really nice to come by and have a chance to ask questions. The public will be able to formulate some opinions so that they can make formal statements at the public hearing.”
David Koo, an urban designer of the project from landscape firm Meléndrez, is optimistic about the streetscape changes on Jefferson Boulevard.
“We’re designing it for safety, for it to be more open and public, more pedestrian-friendly,” he said. “While Subarea 3 is being developed, parts of Jefferson are going to be changed concurrently. Over time, it will be better for pedestrians, cars and cyclists.”
After attending the workshop, Rosaline Tio and Nina Idemudia, both students in USC’s Master of Planning program, pointed to the need to spread the word of these changes to the community in South Los Angeles.
“There are obviously not as many people here as there should be in a large community,” Tio said. “How many people know about this? How many people are going to be shocked when this starts happening? It seems like there are niche groups very informed about it, but among the student population and just residents who live here, there might be a disconnect between who knows about it and who doesn’t.”
Idemudia shared very similar sentiments.
“I found the information very helpful because they were engaging our questions. Overall, it was really good, except that they didn’t engage the community as much,” she said.
She also, however, said she found many positives in the proposed guidelines.
“Multimodal transit and incorporating more bike lanes will be cool,” she said. “It doesn’t seem like it’s going to impact traffic at all, because you’re not losing any driving space, just parking space. Parking’s going to be here or there, but it’s good to have people think about, ‘OK, it’s more inconvenient for me to drive than it is for me to walk.’”

Undergraduate Student Government held a town hall meeting on Tuesday in conjunction with Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council and Division of Student Affairs.
Reflecting · Interfraternity Council President Ofek Lavian speaks about the inevitability of drinking on Tuesday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The forum, which discussed alcohol consumption and social events at USC, was held with the purpose of gathering student reactions and opinions regarding solutions on how to sustain USC’s active social life in a safe environment.
More than 200 students attended the event mediated by Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry.
“This is a night that we have a chance to pivot our university in a real and important way,” Carry said.
Carry also emphasized that the forum was a meeting for the Trojan Family and that the event was a student-organized initiative.
USG Senior Director of Communications Olivia Diamond said that the university wanted to hear from the student population and incorporate their input into a plan that would address the growing issue of excessive alcohol consumption.
“We’ve had forums on many different issues, and these are really beneficial for students to have their voices heard,” Diamond said.
The Q&A format of the discussion allowed students to provide insight and inquiries that were then discussed by the audience and Carry.
Though the audience was encouraged to speak openly during the forum, there were also anonymous notes with questions and comments that were presented and debated over.
The main issue discussed during the meeting was the excessive consumption of alcohol at USC social events as evident by the increasing number of student hospital transports on the weekends.
USG President Christian Kurth spoke about the need to understand that the purpose of the town hall meeting was to discuss and understand the cultural issue of drinking.
“I think the main point is that this isn’t a policy meeting. This is a USC-wide cultural issue, and tonight is about finding out why this is the culture here,” Kurth said.
Ofek Lavian, president of the Interfraternity Council, also spoke about the culture of drinking at USC and the need to address overconsumption.
“Number one, college students drink. We’re not here to change that. We’re trying to find healthy ways to do so, safe ways to do so. There has to be a line drawn when fellow Trojans are at risk,” Lavian said.
The issue of excessive alcohol use led to a discussion of Greek life and its role in the social aspect of USC.
An anonymous note read during the forum presented an alternative to imposing bans on The Row as a whole.
“Why doesn’t the individual fraternity or sorority get a social ban when a member of their group is transported instead of punishing the entire Greek community?” the note read.
Carry and student organization leaders at the event, however, emphasized that the issue was not isolated within Greek life at USC.
“This is not a conversation only about Greek life,” Carry said. “I’m hoping to continue to hear from other students as well. I believe Greek life is important at USC and that’s why I want us to talk.”
The issue of the university’s rules and regulations on Greek life elicited strong reactions from students in the audience.
Oliver Mittelstaedt, a senior majoring in economics and history, said he believes the university’s true concern is avoiding negative publicity.
“We’re so worried about covering our own backs that we come down with these draconian policies that really don’t work,” Mittelstaedt said.
Another anonymous note addressed students’ perspectives on the administration’s apprehensions about the university’s public image.
“We’re seen as a liability because we hurt the university’s image and that affects donors’ and prospective students’ perspectives. They’re afraid that something is going to happen and they’re going to get sued,” the note read.
Carry addressed this perception of the university in defense of the administration.
“This is not about covering our butts, this is not a publicity stunt. We’ve got a chance to pivot this community to create a place that’s fun, to create a place that’s safe,” he said. “The notion that students are units and this is about your tuition dollars is hurtful and untrue.”
Students at the discussion were strongly in favor of continuing this model of town hall meetings to promote student contributions to university policies.
Though many were in favor of these open forums, some students also expressed their concerns about the need for university administrators to take action in response to these meetings.
“Having these meetings is great, and it’s really nice to have the opportunity to give our opinions, but it also matters how they go about following up with action,” said Caroline Cannan, a sophomore majoring in social sciences (psychology).
Others, however, said real change would come only if the administration used the discussion as an impetus for action.
“Whether the administration acts or not is going to be a big signal of if they’re ready to make a positive change,” said Aaron Soskin, a junior majoring in business administration.
Next Saturday, Carry will meet with 14 student organization leaders to think about the ideas presented during the town hall meeting and come up with new solutions for the issue of excessive alcohol use.
Carry concluded the meeting with a comment on his concern for USC students as individuals.
“You are far more than units to me,” he said. “Fight on.”

A couple of the comments that were made at the forum singled out “transports” as individual instances of personal poor judgement in need of stronger sanctions. I and others responded that we might spend less time blaming one another but rather acknowledge the broader cultural problem and make a commitment to do more to watch out for our peers. The former approach is especially damaging when it comes to the issue of sexual violence. There wasn’t a lot of time to go into that at the town hall forum, so thought I’d share this article. If anyone’s inspired by it, or by the forum, the USC Center for Women and Men is developing an awesome new peer leadership program called the S.A.F.E.-T. alliance. Check it out on their website for more info! http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/31/getting-beyond-theadrunkslutanarrativeoncollegecampuses.html
Forum discusses social life, or  put another way,  getting drunk without getting busted by USC.
Yeah, I really don’t appreciate that the underlying assumption here is that all students drink, all students should drink without getting caught, and those who do get caught should not face the proper judgment… As someone who does not drink, I am beginning to feel threatened by the drinking culture that the university essentially just legitimized

Those who knew Thu Yain “Roy” Kyaw remember him for his leadership and unwavering friendship. Kyaw, a sophomore from Singapore, was found dead in his apartment Sunday night. He was 22 years old.
A student in the Marshall School of Business, Roy came to USC last year to study business administration after spending two years serving in the Singaporean Armed Forces.
His brother, Arkar Kyaw, posted a public message to Facebook encouraging those who knew Roy to stay strong and celebrate the time they had with him.
“I know it’s a hard time for everyone especially because of how sudden these news are. However, I just want everyone to remember that accidents do happen, and death is as inevitable a part of life as life itself — his departure just came a lot sooner than we expected. He has gone on to a better place now and is resting in peace smiling, because all of you have made his life up to this point worth living! Thank you so much for that,” Arkar wrote.
Kevin Cai, a junior majoring in business administration, said he met Roy through the business fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi. Cai said Kyaw was not only a leader in the fraternity, but the backbone of their pledge class.
“He was older, but he was super humble,” Cai said. “Within the first week, he became the stabilizing force of our pledge class.”
Daniel Yang, Roy’s friend and a member of DSP, said he never forgot his humble beginnings.
“He knew his parents sacrificed so much for him to be here at USC and get an American education,” Yang said. “His goal was to eventually go back to Myanmar and really give back to his family and his country.”
Though Roy was a business student, he used opportunities given to him to explore other classes outside of the Marshall School. International Relations Professor Steven Lamy said he got to know Roy through his sophomore seminar.
During a dinner with a class speaker last week, Lamy said Roy discussed his future aspirations and his native Myanmar.
“He wanted to find a position in economic consulting or investment and he wanted eventually to return to Burma, where his family was from, and help it succeed in the global economy,” Lamy said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Roy wanted to be successful, but he also wanted to make a difference.”
Lamy said Roy’s commitment and passion for learning will be missed by all who knew him.
“In my class, he was always in the front row taking notes and listening and asking questions,” Lamy said. “He did not spend time on his computer checking emails. He valued the insights he learned from every speaker.”
As an international student, Yang said Roy appreciated every opportunity offered at USC.
“He didn’t take an education from ’SC for granted,” Yang said. “He completely understood what getting an American education at USC meant.”
Regardless of Roy’s future plans, Cai said there was no doubt that he would have been successful.
“Everyone knew he was going to succeed,” Cai said. “He was aspiring to go a million different ways, and I’m sure he could have done any of them.”
For those who knew him well, the unconfirmed reports of alcohol poisoning as Kyaw’s cause of death were difficult to hear.
“He would be the one to make sure that everyone was OK,” Cai said. “He would always be the one to offer to be [the designated driver], so to hear that it’s possible it’s alcohol poisoning is just really hard to believe.”
Cai recalled how he and Roy had plans to meet for dinner and Cai considered canceling. Though he was busy, Cai said he was glad he didn’t.
“I actually grabbed Burmese food with him and some of our pledge brothers,” Cai said. “This tragedy is just a reminder to be a man of your word. If you mean it when you say, ‘Hey, I miss you’ or ‘Hey, I want to hang out,’ you have to do it.”
Yang said the way Roy led his life would be his ultimate legacy.
“Roy taught me to make the most out of every moment — not every day, but every single moment,” Yang said. “Now that he’s gone, the lesson never really hit me until now.”
Roy is survived by parents, an older brother and an older sister.
A memorial service for Roy is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium.

Editor’s note: This post has been corrected to reflect the change in the memorial location and that Kyaw is survived by his parents, an older brother and an older sister. An earlier version said Kyaw is survived by his parents and his older brother. 
The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
He had been a well-liked pupil back in the days of his secondary school. He studied in Ang Mo Kio Secondary School in Singapore, and was a member of the school badminton team.
Despite the fact that he was a reserve player, he had always showed commitment to spar with the main team players, and to help coach the juniors. His willingness to help others and humility in all things had endeared himself to many, students and teachers alike.
Sometimes people guess correctly.
Thank you for taking the time to write a fair tribute to the life of a well-liked USC student, and stopping yourself from succumbing to the sensationalist journalism and guessing games exercised by a separate publication on our campus.

Sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams was named one of 16 semifinalists for the 2013 Chuck Bednarik Award for outstanding defensive player of the year.
Dominant · USC sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams (94) has been vital to the Trojans’ defense, posting a team-high 54 tackles. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Williams is the only underclassman among the semifinalists, who represent six different conferences. The candidates were selected by the Maxwell Football Club National Selection Committee. Williams is up against fellow Pac-12 players Anthony Barr of UCLA, Ifo Ekpre-Olomu of Oregon and Trent Murphy of Stanford.
At 6-foot-5 and 290 lbs., Williams leads the team this season with 54 total tackles, 11 tackles for loss and is tied with redshirt senior linebacker Devon Kennard for five sacks. Defensive Coordinator Clancy Pendergast shifted Williams from defensive tackle to defensive end midway through the season.
The Daytona Beach, Fla. native entered the season coming off a strong debut in 2012. He was named 2012 Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year and made the Freshman All-American team and All Pac-12 honorable mention for Football Writers, Sporting News, Scout.com, College Football News and Phil Steele. Last season, Williams appeared in all 13 games of 2012, starting in nine, and at Stanford, he became the first USC true freshman to start at defensive tackle since 2001.
Winners of the Bednarik Award are determined by voting among Maxwell Football Club members, NCAA football coaches, sports information directors and selected national media. Three finalists will be announced on Nov. 25, followed by a second round of voting. The winner of the award will be announced at the Home Depot College Football Awards Show, which will be broadcast on ESPN on Dec. 12.

Fab frosh · Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu has performed superbly this season, posting 210 kills, good for second-most on the team. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Wednesday’s match against the No. 5 Cardinal (15-4, 8-2 Pac-12) marks a turning point in the season for the No. 8 Women of Troy (18-3, 8-2). The conference schedule is now halfway finished, and although USC has put itself in a great position to become conference champions, it is clear that the team will not be able to cruise to the championship easily.
After winning its first seven conference matches, the squad dropped three straight sets against Arizona on Oct. 20 and lost for the first time this season at home against the No. 3 Huskies on Sunday.
Today’s showdown is also the first midweek match in over a month for the Women of Troy, as the team will now have to play on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the most of the remainder of the regular season. Though the one-day gap between games is nothing new for the team, games in the middle of the week are sure to put extra stress on a squad that has to worry about classes as well as winning volleyball matches. USC head coach Mick Haley saw the effects of this stress firsthand in the match against Washington.
“Our net defense was sloppy,” Haley said. “That’s the hardest of the skills, but it might be due to mental fatigue. We’re right in the middle of midterms, and I think it might be carrying over to the court.”
Stanford — a team ostensibly going through its own share of academic responsibilities — will be a tough task for USC, especially in the middle of the week on the road. The Cardinal, like the Women of Troy, have lost only two matches in Pac-12 play, but have yet to lose at home.
In their previous match against the Cardinal, the Women of Troy prided themselves on efficiently hitting and blocking Stanford’s hit attempts. They outhit Stanford by a wide margin of .358 to .245 on their way to a sweep at the Galen Center. USC senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard, who was largely held in check in the Washington match, posted a monster line in the Oct. 4 tilt against Stanford with nine kills and a .643 hitting percentage. The setters will have to look to set her up at the net to exploit the weaknesses in Stanford’s defense.
Along with Olgard, USC will have plenty of other options with the ball. One of the strengths of USC’s team this season has been its ability to spread the ball around to multiple attackers over the course of the match. In the first match against Stanford, three outside hitters — sophomore Samantha Bricio, freshman Ebony Nwanebu and senior Sara Shaw — each had 10 kills or more. Middle blockers Olgard and junior Hannah Schraer weren’t too far behind with nine and eight kills, respectively.
With a deep bench, there is potential for an even larger distribution of scoring. Haley has even hinted at the idea of bringing new players off the bench to try to get the offense rolling when things come to a halt on the court.
“I hope it brings spark to our team and gets our energy going,” Haley said of playing more of his bench in the upcoming game. “We’re really just looking for more scoring. We want more points and more production.”
Perhaps most important to tonight’s match, however, is not statistics or individual performances, but team effort when adversity hits. Even in the sweep against the Cardinal, the sets were not always easy wins for the Women of Troy. Tonight’s match should be no different.
“We’ve been pushing ourselves too hard,” Haley said of his players’ reactions to their recent slump. “We can’t panic when we don’t play like we want to.”
With Stanford’s recent success, especially at home, USC cannot expect to coast to a win in tonight’s match. Though the benchmark of a team’s success is its performance at the end of the season and not in the middle, a lot is riding on this match as well as the next few to follow.
“The next three weeks will define us,” Haley said. “We lost at Arizona, we lost at home. Now we have to correct, make changes and show we’re getting better.”
The match will begin tonight at 7:30 p.m. at Stanford’s Maples Pavilion and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

In the era of NCAA sanctions, the trajectory of the USC football program can always be identified by how they play in the game before Halloween. Around the season’s three-quarters mark, the team’s lack of depth due to scholarship losses becomes increasingly evident.
In former head coach Lane Kiffin’s first year, USC played undefeated and highly ranked Oregon close for most of the game before wilting at the end. This showcased a Trojan squad with the talent to compete, but the inability to string four complete quarters together against an upper-echelon team.
In 2011, the triple-overtime thriller against Stanford signaled a team on the rise, eventually reaching the pinnacle of the Kiffin era with a narrow upset victory over Oregon in Eugene. The final October game of 2012 saw a record-setting performance by then-sophomore wide reciever Marqise Lee against Arizona overshadowed by a loss caused by a plethora of Trojan miscues. This theme was emblematic of last year’s USC team in the dismal second half of last season.
This season, though, has been different. In its final pre-Halloween game, the Trojans didn’t face an elite team or come into the game highly ranked. They played a middling Utah team that typifies mediocrity. Last Saturday, though, wasn’t really about playing the Utes — it was about successfully navigating the team’s perilous roster situation.
The days leading up to Saturday’s game made one thing patently evident: The NCAA’s draconian sanctions against the Trojans are really having an effect. In stark contrast, last week the NCAA levied their punishment against the Miami football program, only taking away nine scholarships over a three-year period.
Compounding the Trojans’ scholarship issues is the rash of injuries currently afflicting the team. As Miami was getting off easy last week, junior linebacker Lamar Dawson suffered a season-ending injury. Redshirt freshman offensive lineman Jordan Simmons and redshirt sophomore running back Taylor Ross also fell prey to the injury bug, unfortunately ending their seasons early.
This signals the biggest issue with the sanctions — the safety of student-athletes. It’s clear the NCAA doesn’t truly care about the health of USC players, as these sanctions have created an atmosphere conducive to injury. Fatigue, the inability to practice properly and inexperienced players being thrust into action all led to a bevy of unnecessary injuries. By Saturday, USC was down to 52 scholarship athletes.
So entering the Utah game, it was only natural to expect the worst. The team had no scholarship tight ends, three healthy scholarship wide receivers and a defense missing three key contributors — certainly not a combination that usually yields success and victory. Making matters more difficult was the fact that the team was forced to replace injured starters with multiple untested true freshman and a motley crew of walk-ons.
The combination of all these debilitating factors could easily have hamstrung the Trojans, with the end result being a loss and fans hearing the party line excuse of “sanctions and injuries.” Though it might be a completely valid excuse, it is not how a hallmark program such as USC should respond to the NCAA’s corruption.
Instead, USC came out Saturday with an inspired, impassioned performance. It wasn’t necessarily pretty, but it was the most emphatic and important victory for the Trojans since the NCAA handed down their penalties. It showed that even in their weakest state, the Trojans would not be mediocre. They will beat pedestrian teams, such as Utah, even with both proverbial hands tied behind their back.
USC’s lone touchdown was symbolic in that it served as a metaphor for the high-wire act the Trojans walk. A banged-up Nelson Agholor turned in a valiant performance, specifically his brilliant touchdown. Balancing on the tightrope of the sideline, barely avoiding the boundary, the sophomore wide receiver was able to fight his way into the end zone, just as the Trojans will fight their way through the sanctions.
Against Utah, the Trojans embodied the tenets interim coach Ed Orgeron lives by. They competed and fought; they played with moxie and determination and made no excuses for their predicament. That is the mark of a true Trojan squad. Redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey’s Herculean effort to come into the game after halftime is the stuff of legend.
What the sanctions intended to do was mire USC in mediocrity. By beating Utah, the Trojans showed they simply wouldn’t be average. This pre-Halloween game was bigger than a mid-afternoon showdown against Utah on the Pac-12 Networks. It was about fighting through the adversity and playing for the Trojan teams of the past and the future. It showed that no matter how hard the NCAA tries, USC will prevail in the end.

The Trojans had their most physical practice of the week on Tuesday, according to interim head coach Ed Orgeron, as they continue to prepare for Friday night’s showdown with the Oregon State Beavers in Corvallis, Ore.
Heroic · USC redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey provided a spark for the team on Saturday when he suited up for the second half against Utah. Bailey is tied for sixth on the team with 35 total tackles this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Though the team has a shorter amount of time to prepare for the Beavers, Orgeron believes that having a shorter week of practice could actually benefit the team because of its lack of depth.
“It is what is,” Orgeron said of the team’s numerous injuries. “We are going to have to accept the challenge.”
Orgeron has not wasted any time in simulating the hostile environment in Corvallis, as he brought out the speakers to project the loud crowd noise the players expect to hear Friday night at Reser Stadium.
“These noise simulations are especially important for the offense and getting snap counts right, but it also gets the guys fired up,” Orgeron said.
Aerial assault
The main focus for defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast and the USC defense this week is to find a way to stop Beavers quarterback Sean Mannion and the Beavers’ passing attack, which leads the nation in passing yards per game. Mannion leads the nation with 30 passing touchdowns and has only three interceptions through eight games.
Perhaps equally as impressive as Mannion this season has been OSU wide receiver Brandin Cooks. USC redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey gave most of the credit for the Beavers’ prolific passing attack to Cooks, who has 13 receiving touchdowns so far this season.
“Cooks is really good at catching balls down the field,” Bailey said. “We need to focus more about him than any of the other receivers.”
The Trojans’ passing defense ranks third in the Pac-12, and the team is ranked first in total defense, meaning the Beavers will have their work cut out for them.
“Something’s got to give,” senior safety Demetrius Wright said of Friday’s matchup. “It’s a tough, hostile environment that we are going to have to overcome.”
Second-Half Hero 
Perhaps the most notable moment from USC’s victory over Utah was Bailey’s return in the second half. Originally ruled inactive for the game, Bailey, who watched the first half in street clothes, decided to suit up and play in the second half after freshman safety Su’a Cravens left with a strained groin. Orgeron praised Bailey for overcoming adversity and stepping up for his teammates.
“It is tough for a player to skip practice and play at a level like Bailey did last week,” Orgeron said.
Bailey expects to suit up this Saturday as well, though he admitted that he felt hindered by his injury during the Utah game.
“I’m going to play as much as Coach [Pendergast] allows me to play,” Bailey said.
Bailey’s decision to play in the second half had a lot to do with his dedication to Orgeron, who has done many things in the way of inspiring his players following former head coach Lane Kiffin’s dismissal.
“Coach O has done a lot for us, and this has been a season to remember,” Bailey said. “Playing [on Saturday] was the least I could do.”
Redemption
A big concern for Orgeron and his coaching staff against Notre Dame two weeks ago was the performance of junior kicker Andre Heidari, who missed two costly field goals in the 14-10 loss in South Bend, Ind.
Against Utah, Heidari was much improved, making four for five field goals in the 19-3 win over the Utes, garnering a nomination for Pac-12 Special Teams Player of the Week.
Heidari attributed his success to the help of a sports psychologist he often works with, and a general “on to the next one” attitude.
“I put it in the past,” Heidari said of his disastrous performance.
Injury Report 
One thing USC wishes it could put in the past is the plethora of injuries the team has suffered lately. For this week’s game against the Beavers, senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin and redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer are not expected to play, while junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble are questionable but expected to participate.

I would like to see us operate from the I Formation more. That fullback in front of the tailback gives us one extra blocker to attack the point of attack and knock off a linebacker filling the hole. I have seen us run that formation and we have had success. I am not saying line up that way every play, but if we do give that look and have a running play we will have more success in our running game. I know it and I hope the coaches will use it more frequently. Go Trojans!

In Japan, lore featuring figures, such as an old martial arts master who lives on a mountain far away from civilization, abound. Picture it: his beard long from age, his head bald from wisdom and his body strong from endless training. This mysterious old figure speaks to no one. Only the chosen one who dares to venture into the foreign mountains of Asia can learn this old man’s secrets. But in order to gain the master’s trust, the chosen individual must follow the master’s strange riddles and tasks without question.
Fitting the mold · Marvels & Monsters seeks to analyze the way Asians have been portrayed in popular culture. One of the American portrayals of Asian women has been that of a Temptress, as pictured above. – Kalai Chik | Daily Trojan
 
Descriptions such as the above contribute to the agelong image of the guru archetypes. Along with the guru, other Asian characterizations are examined in the new Japanese American National Museum exhibition: Marvels & Monsters: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics, 1942-1986.
The new exhibit contains tales of mystical beings in American comic books. Despite its origin in South Asia, the guru archetype has evolved into the epitome of plot devices in modern media. The exhibit contains the most extensive repository of Asian and Asian-American characters in American comics, featuring cultural studies scholar William F. Wu’s own personal collection. From the United States’ fear of the foreign unknown to the fascination for Eastern education, Marvels & Monsters effectively analyzes Asian representation during four tumultuous periods of American social unrest. Notably, the exhibit triumphantly shines light on the dark ages of American history and raises awareness to end the media’s deceptive perpetuation of stereotypes.
The exhibition focuses on eight common archetypes: Guru, Brain, Temptress, Lotus Blossom, Brute, Alien, Kamikaze and Manipulator. Each trope is placed in context, incorporating commentary and analysis from Asian-American comic book writers such as Greg Pak and poets such as Ken Chen. What the exhibit lacks in space, it makes up for with incredible yet shocking images of Asian archetypes. Visitors can come   face-to-face with the full-size cutouts of nostalgic scenes exemplifying the preservation of misrepresentations, which, in reality, continue to persist today. A piece called “Shades of Yellow” provides a gradient of Asian skin tones found in comics emphasizing the stark yellow Pantone faces in comparison to a highlighter yellow wall.
One of the most interesting parts of the exhibit is the inclusion of the Lotus Blossom and the Temptress, both illustrating the fetishization of Asian woman as sexual objects. Underneath the large Lotus Blossom title lies the violent image of a damsel who is moments away from death at the hands of her lover, hurt from her betrayal. These representations of both Asian men and women highlight the misguided beliefs behind these archetypes and expose the consequences of negative portrayals of Asians. Though many contemporary scholars argue the Western male exploitation of Asian women was beneficial to both sides, the exhibit argues the opposite. Analysis provided by David Henry Hwang explains that the Lotus Blossom archetype was clearly “born of sexual and economic exploitation” where the Western males capitalized on “economically underprivileged” Asian female bodies.
This past weekend, William Wu, the collection donor, traveled to Little Tokyo to tour the exhibit. An acclaimed sci-fi author and cultural studies scholar, Wu is no stranger to American fiction’s portrayal of Asians and Asian-Americans. An avid comic book reader growing up, Wu found himself captivated yet disgusted by the distorted depiction of Asians in print media. Along with the help of friends and family, he amassed an assortment mainstream comic books with a multitude of distorted renditions of Asians. Initially, Wu inspired Jeff Yang’s idea for the exhibit after Wu donated his comics to the New York University Fales Library and Special Collections.
The traveling exhibition displays many stereotypes illustrated in some of the most well-known Marvel and DC comic book series such as Iron Man and Batman. And though many of these same negative portrayals of Asians and Asian-Americans have become more subtle, they remain very prevalent in mainstream media. Arguably, these fictional images continue to fuel the mistrust in the sensitive American mind as more and more of the younger generation are exposed to harmful portraits of Asians and Asian-Americans painted by years of fear and social unrest.
Even though the villain Mandarin is not depicted as Asian in some mainstream adaptations of Iron Man, he retains his Fu Manchu moustache and is still called “The Mandarin.” Clearly, depictions of stereotypes originally intended as war propaganda can lead to long-term, unintended social repercussions. Even in more peaceful times, the constant circulation of stereotypes only serves to steer America in the path of social chaos and destruction.
Marvels and Monsters: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics, 1942-1986 is on display at the Japanese American National Museum until Feb. 9. Perhaps the old master will descend from his obscure location to teach people the secret to bringing peace and harmony: raising cross-cultural awareness.

A wise character in Mean Girls once said: “In girl world, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.” These words will forever be associated with the modern expectations of a proper Halloween costume. Add the words “sexy” or “adult” to just about anything and, if you’re a girl, your Halloween costume is good to go.
The question is, does this rule ever apply to male costumes? More importantly, should it apply to male costumes? GQ recently explored this subject in an online article titled “Slutty Halloween Costumes … For Dudes.” The costumes, however, were sorely disappointing, in my opinion. Then again, my overactive imagination immediately pictured a photo shoot of GQ models going to door to door in barely any clothing. No such luck.
As one snide commenter pointed out, maybe GQ should stick to fashion and avoid humor altogether, since this article was not even giggle-inducing. It does not take a lot of thought to come up with a half-a–ed Breaking Bad costume. Don’t even get me started on the sexy Vladimir Putin costume — one well-wrapped rainbow towel is not enough to make that idea ironic or appealing. To be honest, I didn’t even recognize two of the costumes included.
Forgive me if I’m wrong, but the word slutty, when used near the end of October, entails a costume that breaks the rules of acceptable clothing in a fun, sexy way. It takes some planning to make yourself into a sexy zombie, or even to reappropriate a childhood staple, such as a Disney princess, into a sultry vixen. Not entirely original, but they still get the job done.
On the other hand, the costumes included in the GQ article are not sexy. The Beetlejuice meets flamboyant referee outfit that Robin Thicke wore during his VMAs performance did not do him any favors, so what makes it a good idea for anyone else to wear? The so-called slutty male costumes from the GQ article were, in short, truly uninspired. There is a subtle genius behind some girls’ ability to take a cuddly woodland creature and turn it into a sex symbol.
Yes, the article is obviously meant to be a satire of today’s Halloween culture; it pokes fun at American male sexuality and our expectation of female attire on Halloween. In this respect, the article is also pretty revealing. Why is the idea of a guy in a skimpy costume something to be made fun of and not an idea that is considered legitimate and even, by a further stretch, acceptable on this holiday?
As children, Halloween costumes are either store-bought or homemade, but, boy or girl, they are meant to be cute. Even the “scary” costumes are endearing in their own devilish charm. With every year, however, the bar is raised. Girls are expected to show off their bodies and by the time they reach high school, female Halloween costumes are an excuse to bare skin and attract the attention of others.
But what of male costumes? There’s always the token goofball who dresses up as a girl or the muscled jock who finds a costume that requires him to be shirtless, but these are the exceptions rather than the norm for guy attire. Are we, as a culture, really that uncomfortable with the concept of male sexuality?
Slutty girl costumes are a trend that reappears every year, without fail. And with every year the costumes get more and more outrageous. Yet, for some reason, it is not also a mainstream trend for guys to show off their bodies as much as possible. Outside of the gay scene, which admittedly thrives in a city such as Los Angeles, most men do not view Halloween as a chance to parade their bodies around for everyone to see.
This modest male behavior seems to be an attribute specific to humans. In the animal kingdom, some members of the male species are more prized than their female counterparts for their extravagant garb. Most, in fact, don’t even restrict themselves to one night of the year. Take the peacock, for example. That multicolored plumage and fancy head crest certainly do not belong to girl peahens. Likewise, a lion’s mane is a display of sexual maturity and overall testosterone levels. Lady lions are left to admire the male’s mane like a model in a Pantene commercial.
Returning to the world of humans, it becomes clear that there is a gaping discrepancy between male and female human presentation, especially on Halloween. The lack of male exploitation in Halloween costumes can’t be due to an absence of public desire; the endless number of Tumblrs dedicated to shirtless leading men proves otherwise.
Male sexuality, as viewed by most global cultures, adheres to a very rigid definition. Though human sexual identity is increasingly viewed with the fluidity it deserves, progress with this concept is slow, even among the more accepting societies of the world. Perhaps it is an objectification issue or a pervading sense of machismo in modern society. The male body is often employed as a tool of humor in Hollywood culture, whereas the female physique is more commonly displayed as an object of desire.
Whatever the reason, it remains a fact that on Halloween, girls are expected to dress scandalously while guys can dress however they want. The slutty costume trend has stuck around for longer than some of USC’s students have been alive, which is impressive staying power compared to other fashion trends. Maybe someday it will feel completely normal to see an Adult Little Red Riding Dude costume sitting on a shelf next to Adult Little Red Riding Hood.
In the meantime, head down to Santa Monica Boulevard on Halloween if you’re really feeling deprived of some man candy. You won’t even have to say trick or treat.

In food there can be too much of a good thing — not that Open Sesame knows that yet. The Lebanese restaurant’s flagship location in Belmont Shore has been Long Beach’s worst-kept secret for almost 14 years. Lines and reservations overflowed at the original location until Open Sesame opened a second location — literally a 10-second walk down the same street. The original restaurant remains a favorite with the Belmont Shore locals, who endure waits upwards of half an hour on the weekends on a street teeming with decent food options.
Winner, winner · One of Open Sesame’s best entrees is the chicken tawook, a skewer of marinated chicken breast chunks grilled over an open fire and served with jasmine rice. The entree also comes with a tangy, intensely flavorful garlic paste for dipping, as well as salad and hummus. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
The restaurant reached a little farther for its third location — situated on Beverly Boulevard and Gardener Street just northeast of Culver City, the restaurant finally opened its doors earlier last week in Eva’s old space. Though it’s still in its earlier stages of opening, the Mid-City location has all the confidence and strong execution of its original location — including some improvements over the Belmont Shore eatery.
After ascending the stairs into the restaurant’s main dining room, the first thing to note about Open Sesame is its small size. In one particularly crowded area, a row of tables and chairs creates a narrow corridor between the service window and dining tables. The overall layout of the restaurant is intimate and warm — a feeling that is reinforced by the dark wood and orange and maroon lighting scheme.
The food at Open Sesame is similarly warm and alluring — the restaurant offers a range of fire-grilled meat skewers, with choices ranging from kafta (a ground mix of sirloin and lamb) to chicken tawook (marinated breast chunks) to filet mignon and tiger shrimp. Many of the entrees come with a side of rice, a choice of salad and a choice of hummus or baba ghannouj.
The star of the show is the chicken tawook — marinated chunks of breast are grilled over open fire to a juicy doneness and served with an addictive garlic spread. The paste is similar to the ones found in sealed containers at Zankou Chicken with one key difference: Open Sesame’s version positively blossoms with the flavor of fresh garlic, with even the slight kick of heat that comes from eating raw garlic. Hopefully your date won’t mind.
Open Sesame applies a similar attention to detail with its other dishes; tabouleh (a Mediterranean salad consisting of chopped parsley, mint, lemon juice and bulgur wheat) goes heavy on the chopped tomatoes, giving the dish a substantive texture without sacrificing the clean acidity of the mint and lemon juice combination.
Also, someone at Open Sesame has boiled down the making of baba ghannouj to a science — the restaurant’s rendition is the best money can buy in Los Angeles. Open Sesame’s version of the eggplant puree manages to feel smooth and creamy without being too runny, which makes it perfect for spreading on pita bread. The slight tang of eggplant and tahini acts as a canvas for an intensely smoky, rich finish that lingers long after the meal ends.
For all of its raving successes, Open Sesame’s red meats falter slightly. Sirloin steak ordered medium arrives a half step short of well-done. Though the meat manages to stay tender, there’s not much beefy flavor to make it stand out, as is usually the case with leaner cuts of sirloin. The kafta is also nothing terribly noteworthy, albeit far better than average. The mixture of ground beef and lamb usually comes out dry and best suited for use in sandwiches as opposed to a stand-alone entree, but Open Sesame’s version is reassuringly juicier and doesn’t skimp on the gamey taste of lamb. Regardless, both dishes are pedestrian choices on a menu that boasts some of the best chicken skewers in the city.
The dishes certainly don’t sound like a white tablecloth affair on paper, but Open Sesame’s phenomenal service bears mention. Members of the staff deftly whisk between the narrow spaces in the restaurant with equal parts grace and deference. The service staff is knowledgeable about the food options and pleasantly attentive. While Mediterranean cuisine can often feel like dressed-up take-out food, Open Sesame’s execution and attention to detail is undeniable — this is food deserving of a full restaurant experience.
Open Sesame is sure to gain a foothold in a busy restaurant corridor that includes the likes of BLD and Angelini Osteria. Word seems to be spreading, and it’s only a matter of time before the bookings fill up and the line snakes down the stairs. So is there such thing as too much of a good thing? In Open Sesame’s case, the answer is no — at least not yet.

Reality might be on the verge of a face-lift, one that could redefine the way consumers interact with the physical world thanks to software created by two USC undergraduate students.
Karthik Gollapudi, a junior majoring in business administration, and Evan Tann, a senior majoring in business administration, have built software for wearable devices called Cloudwear.
Gollapudi and Tann met for a Daily Trojan interview after they spent 17 hours straight planning and coding for their Cloudwear startup. When asked what they were thinking while coding at 1 a.m., Gollapudi snuck in a witty smirk.
“Why did we not buy more Red Bull?” Gollapudi said. “We don’t stop.”
Their goal is to use artificial intelligence to digitize the physical world and connect it to the online world. Their software will allow wearable devices such as Google Glass and the new Samsung Smartwatch to recognize everything a user sees and overlay it with a digital layer.
The idea grew from wanting to be able to immediately interact with anything a person might come across in one’s every day life.
“Right now when something catches your eye, you take out your phone and Google it,” Gollapudi said. “We see an easier way to do that.”
They claim that Cloudwear will make a person’s life easier by displaying the Internet’s information in a physical form.
Tann said their software represents a new medium of communication that allows people to interact with technology in a way that brings the digital sphere closer to their daily lives.
“We’re letting you recognize anything around you and have some action around you,” Tann said. “Let’s say you are headed toward a dangerous area. Cloudwear should be aware of that and should warn you through your wearable devices about another route that is potentially safer.”
Tann explained that the software is able to do this through specific sensors that recognize “pain points” of the physical world, such as danger, traffic or long lines. Tann wrote several algorithms that make this software a reality.
“Because Cloudwear is able to know what’s going on around you, it can provide information before you even have to ask,” Tann said. “Technology is headed in a direction where it delivers information before you have to go out and search for it yourself.”
Gollapudi is confident that wearable devices will only increase in popularity and improve people’s lives, and Cloudwear is already in the process of facilitating just that. But he said it is not the devices themselves that are truly revolutionary. To him, what is noteworthy lies in code.
“Wearables alone aren’t going to change the world,” Gollapudi said. “It’s going to be the software on those wearables, and we’re building that software.”
Gollapudi and Tann met in an engineering course in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. After three months of work, they launched a pilot program of Cloudwear this week to share with some clients who have expressed interest.
The partners said they are looking forward to taking wearable technology to the next level for the consumer’s benefit. The two students said they believe in a future where people have more time to do the things they care about with the people they love rather than interfacing with electronic devices.
“Wearables bring people closer together and are not just toys,” Tann said. “The whole purpose is to actually make your life easier, and we want to enable the technology that does that for you.”
Cloudwear wants to start by helping consumers in their everyday lives. When a person sees a coffee machine through his or her Google Glass, for example, the Cloudwear software will offer instructional videos. Or if one is looking at the ingredients of a certain food, Cloudwear will automatically provide him or her with cooking instructions.
In the same way that Apple built the iPhone but millions of different developers contribute through apps, Gollapudi and Tann are not necessarily trying to do it all. They said there are numerous other applications developers will build for wearables. Their goal is to focus on building the sensors that recognize the physical world and the tools to overlay reality with an interactive layer.
Ultimately their eagerness to be working on something so much bigger than themselves with the potential to make a global impact keeps these two engineers pushing forward.
“That’s why I get up in the morning and I’m so excited to code for it,” Tann said. “I know that I’m working on something that’s significant for all of human history, that’s going to change how people interact with each other and the world.”

In accordance with National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations, Division I college athletes devote up to 20 hours per week to sports practice in season with only one day off per week and a competition day that counts for three hours. In the United States, employees who work 20 hours per week are considered part-time employees; evidently, college athletes spend much more time working than any part-time employee. The NCAA has pondered for years whether or not to pay its college athletes for the hard work they put into their discipline. A better alternative, however, would be to create an interdisciplinary sports major that could incorporate athletes’ firsthand knowledge and prepare them for a career off of the field.
Realistically speaking, most student athletes will never make a living as professional athletes. In the Huffington Post, former Stanford student-athlete Emily Layden wrote, “There are over 400,000 NCAA athletes, and for the majority graduation is as far as sport will carry them … It is a part of the story no one writes about, and for which I was entirely unprepared.” Like Layden, many college athletes spend so much of their college careers training that they do not think twice about the bittersweet reality that awaits them, diploma in hand. Without a proper curriculum that trains student-athletes to use their unique experience to their advantage, these former idols are left helpless in a increasingly competitive work market.
At USC, there are many classes that could be integrated into a sports major. Many of the core classes for the broadcast journalism major, such as JOUR 303: “Reporting: Broadcast” and JOUR 310: “Investigative Reporting” should be required, but the major would also include classes such as JOUR 380: “Sports, Business and Media in Today’s Society” and JOUR 441: “Sports Reporting.” There are also plenty of public relations and business classes that would be beneficial. Even without creating additional classes, this new major for college athletes is entirely plausible.
Today, many former athletes continue into the business world after retiring from professional sports and college athletes can learn from the career paths these ex-players take. For instance, Mark Jackson, a former NBA player, became a broadcast commentator after retiring from basketball. Some of the most successful broadcasters in the sports industry are former players themselves with a firsthand knowledge of their sport; in this same way, student athletes can use their expertise and experience to stand out from other applicants. In order for athletes to be adequately prepared, however, they must be offered a major that integrates a wide range of academic disciplines and have their extensive practice times and additional workout hours acknowledged as credible major requirements.
Another career path that many college athletes can consider taking is the path of entrepreneurship. Student athletes are able to make connections in the business world that most college kids can only dream of, and to not take advantage of the opportunity would be an opportunity lost.
Tiki Barber, ex-NFL running back, is one of the many athletes to successfully create his own business after a career in professional sports. Following his retirement at the end of 2006 season, Barber created a virtual marketplace that connects athletes with companies, fans and non-profits looking to hire them. In an interview with Entrepreneur, Barber said, “During this time [of retirement], I identified an issue that arises with many former athletes. They have a brand and an expertise that they spend their entire lives developing as professional athletes that they can no longer monetize because the Giants, Knicks or Lakers are not willing to pay for that expertise anymore.”
In the Marshall School of Business, classes such as BAEP 553: “Cases in New Venture Management” and BAEP 470: “The Entrepreneurial Mindset –— Taking the Leap” are already offered, allowing the university to create a new major that recognizes a student athlete’s special skills as an academic pursuit as well as a hobby.
Entrepreneurship and broadcast journalism are not the only two paths that student athletes can take. Former athletes have become successful teachers, coaches, CEOs and writers: in virtually any and all fields, a student-athlete can thrive. But if we continue to treat our student-athletes like undeserving cogs in a machine, they will never find themselves thriving off of the field. Once schools begin to recognize that sports, not unlike theater and art, is a sincere academic pursuit when combined with the right disciplines, student-athletes will succeed both in a competitive environment and an academic one.

In today’s world, taking pictures has become easier than ever: The days of lugging around a camera or extraneous equipment are gone, and smartphones have taken their place. Smartphones and their high-quality cameras are the future, and digital camera manufacturers such as Sony  are starting to take notice.
Nancy Chiu | Daily Trojan
Sony recently released a new line of digital-imaging products: the Cyber-Shot QX10 and QX100, two digital cameras that have redefined the word “camera.” But while these two models are technically digital cameras, they are missing some very crucial components such as a flash, a viewfinder and advanced image controls are all absent.
So how do these new models function without these parts? By embracing the smartphone — literally. Sony’s newest inventions physically attach to most iPhone and Android smartphone devices and are linked to each other through the lens-camera’s included a Wi-Fi hot spot. After users download a Sony application called PlayMemories Mobile, the smartphone becomes the viewing screen and any pictures taken will be downloaded directly to the phone’s camera roll, bringing photography and smartphone technology together in a new way. The whole setup process is easy and seamless, almost as easy as simply pressing the camera button on your phone.
The QX10 has a 10x optical zoom and an 18-megapixel image sensor, costing buyers $250 — or around as much as it would normally cost to buy a digital camera with those specifications. The more expensive QX100 costs $500 and has a 3.6x optical zoom and a larger, 20-megapixel sensor. Both devices shoot full high-definition video and can be transported and traveled with much more easily than a full-sized camera.
Some might argue that there is no need for such attachable cameras and that smartphones take pictures just fine on their own — which for the most part, they do. Smartphone cameras have been impressively advanced to take remarkable quality pictures; but many times, it is painfully obvious that certain pictures have been taken with a smartphone. Smartphone cameras lack a certain richness of color and depth and a higher megapixel count that can only be achieved with a digital camera. With Sony’s inventions, these higher-quality photos can be achieved with the same degree of mobility.
These types of attachable digital cameras acknowledge society’s dependency on mobility and smartphones, but makes better use of it. People don’t want to be bogged down with heavy camera equipment and enjoy their lightweight smartphone contraptions, regardless of the slightly lesser quality of the photos. Sony’s new models suggest the beginning of the experimentation of an entirely new form of photography — a kind of “smart photography” that utilizes today’s smartphone technology and the basic function of digital cameras.
So the next time you’re at a concert, take a look around you. Count how many people are taking pictures, and then compare that number with how many people are using the more traditional, non-smartphone digital cameras. Just as photographers have adapted, so must digital cameras.
