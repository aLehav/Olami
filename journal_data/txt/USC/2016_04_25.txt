Former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Leon Panetta spoke on the contested nature of politics in the 2016 presidential election, as well as the geopolitical and domestic challenges that the next president will face at the President’s Distinguished Lecture Monday evening in Town and Gown.
Panetta, who worked under the Barack Obama administration after serving 16 years in the House of Representatives, began by describing his roots as the son of Italian immigrants, who taught him the value of hard work at an early age. Perseverance, Panetta said, is crucial for politicians to actually work towards solving the issues facing the United States rather than simply bandaging them up.
“In a democracy we govern either by leadership or by crisis,” Panetta said. “Unfortunately, we largely govern by crisis today. We wait until an issue becomes critical, bringing us to the edge of going off a cliff, and then rather than dealing with the issue, we do a temporary fix and kick the can down the road.”
According to Panetta, these problems are many and varied, starting with the domestic politics of the current election cycle. A failure of established leadership to meet the needs of the American people, Panetta said, has led numerous presidential candidates to take increasingly extreme positions — such as building a wall along the Mexican border, barring all Muslims from entering the United States or promising to shut down the “big banks” on Wall Street — rather than working together to address real problems.
“What we are dealing with today is an angry and frustrated public that feels that too often the so-called establishment has not delivered what was promised,” Panetta said. “Candidates are making all kinds of promises that will never be delivered on. The last thing we need is to have more promises that have no chance of success — four more years of gridlock or paralysis could badly damage this country.”
This partisanship is reflected in gridlock in Washington, which Panetta said is “the worst it’s been in 50 years.” Failure to balance the budget, pass immigration reform and fill a Supreme Court vacancy are hallmarks of a government that is too mired in conflict along party lines to govern effectively — an issue that Panetta said requires leaders who are willing to take risks, make difficult choices and offend those in their own party in order to do what is right.
“We need people to make tough decisions,” Panetta said. “The next president is going to have to be willing to call on the leadership and the Congress to sit down and make the decisions that will not only discipline our budget but make investments in key areas for our future. It takes leadership and a willingness to sacrifice …  And it’s not going to be easy, but it is what is needed.”
At the same time, the United States is facing increasing pressure from both allies and enemies abroad, as Panetta said that the country is facing more “flash points” that have the potential to quickly escalate into war than at any other time since the end of World War II. These include “failed states” such as Syria, Libya and Yemen, as well as aggressive actors such as Russia and North Korea. Panetta stressed that despite progress made post-9/11 to prevent large-scale terrorist attacks from occurring in the United States, the threat from terrorism is the most immediate challenge that the United States faces in the foreign policy arena.
“ISIS is a clear and present danger to the United States,” Panetta said. “It has the capacity to strike anytime, anywhere. The president has set the right mission, which is to defeat ISIS, and he’s put the right elements in place. But the reality is that these efforts must be intensified if we are to truly defeat ISIS and remove them from the territory that they control.”
The solution to such problems, Panetta said, rests with the American people, who can exercise their right to vote to make change on the national level. The president that they elect, according to Panetta, must be able to “break the gridlock in Washington to deal with critical issues facing this country,” a process that will require legislating away from party lines.
“I believe in American leadership,” Panetta said. “We’ve faced crises in the past — world wars and recessions and depressions and natural disasters. Yet somehow we’ve always risen to the occasion, and I think we will again because the fundamental strength of this country doesn’t reside in the District of Columbia. It resides in the people — in your spirit, your resilience, your common sense and in your willingness to fight.”

Christopher Celenza, the second of three candidates for dean of USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, spoke to students and faculty on Monday about why he wants the position, why he has the relevant experience to take it on and why he believes he is best suited for the job.
Celenza holds two Ph.D.s — one in history from Duke University and one in Neo-Latin Literature from the University of Hamburg, and is currently the vice dean for humanities and social sciences at Johns Hopkins University.
Celenza spent four years as the Director of the American Academy in Rome where he oversaw fundraising and administration and became an interim librarian.
Celenza said his experience managing the Academy in Rome made him realize that this position was something he “could do well, really loved doing and wanted to do in a larger context.”
When questioned about his plans to further the science programs at USC, Celenza admitted that though he does not have a background in the sciences, he has done his research and said that the biggest problem facing science majors today is a lack of funding for risky ventures.
“One thing I would suggest for the science is that we work really hard to develop innovation funds,” Celenza said. “Good science often involves risk, it often involves disruption and USC needs to have that environment where people can feel comfortable going after their riskier ideas.”
If chosen as dean, Celenza said that his first three to six months on the job would be “listening months.”
“[My] focus will be on interacting with department chairs, institute heads and interested groups of undergraduates,” Celenza said. “Then we can spend the next academic year coming up with focus groups that can really operationalize those ideas in a structured three- to five-year plan.”
One of Celenza’s main goals at USC is to be present in campus life. He wants to be someone that people can easily reach out to and talk to about issues in Dornsife.
“A dean, even though they might be busy, has to be able to reach out to individuals,” Celenza said. “If someone’s not convinced, they must do all they can to make them feel respected and listen hard to what they say.”
Celenza believes that a main problem undergraduates face is that they tend to change jobs every five years. Because of that, his goal for undergraduate students is to foster resilience because employers need flexibility in their employees.
Celenza said that there should be a strong emphasis on proximity and presence to foster conversations and ideas that can further a school.
“I would love to see experiential learning programs, collective spaces where undergraduates can gather to discuss things they are passionate about,” Celenza said.
Dornsife’s previous dean Stephen Kay left the job earlier than expected, and many in attendance were curious about whether Celenza would look at this position as simply a stepping stone to greater things.
When asked about his future plans beyond the position of dean, Celenza responded that USC is an ideal destination in his professional career and that he would want to stay as long as possible.
On his leadership style, Celenza said that he believes in “finding the right leadership teams and giving them the gift of trust.”
One of the attendees, Senior Administrator for Dornsife Architectural Services James McElwain, said these forums were incredibly helpful in allowing the faculty and students to get to know their prospective dean.
“I love the fact that they’re willing to have us speak with the candidates. You just get a little taste of who this person is,” McElwain said.
Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Quick has not yet released the name of the third and final candidate.

A group of USC students are looking at a new reality.
Greg Feingold, a junior majoring in business cinematic arts, has started a virtual reality production company, VR The World. With minimal equipment and a team of students from different fields, VRTW has produced content for Coachella, Springfest and the USC Rowing Team.
Alongside Stephen Jensen, a junior majoring in sound design, Noah Yoseloff and Jacob Sami, a senior and a sophomore  respectively both majoring in business administration, the team of four students comprise the technology startup.
Feingold’s said his recent introduction to VR technology came after he bought his first VR camera.
“I’ve been into virtual reality for about six months now. I got to work on it in my internship,” Feingold said. “I was able to buy a camera at SXSW, one of the first 360-degree consumer cameras. It’s just two cameras and it stitches [the video] automatically.”
For one of their first projects, Feingold used the $350 camera to film a VR production for the USC Men’s Rowing team, which picked up hits from around the world.
“I made a rowing film — I’m on the rowing team at USC. I sent it to a few people but it got really viral within the rowing community,” Feingold said. “We got messages from the Kuwaiti national rowing team, people in Great Britain, teams in Australia. Lots of people were sharing it.”
Their latest projects include on-campus endeavors, such as 360-degree videos for Springfest earlier this month and the New Moon Music Festival benefit for the USC chapter of Room to Read. But over the past two weekends, Feingold and Yoseloff found themselves working alongside the Coachella VR production team to create experiential content for the festival.
“[I] got hired by Coachella for the last two weekends, to help make their official content. I was on the filming team,” Feingold said. “The first weekend, we walked around with GoPro rigs and we would go into the crowd and on stage.”
Apart from festivals, most of the startup’s clients are in the real estate, marketing and music industry fields. A particularly novel use of the 360-degree video technology has been to showcase open houses from across the country.
“I started getting a lot of requests from people to make them videos, real estate firms, marketing companies, convert and record labels,” Feingold said. “People in L.A. might want to see a house in New York and they don’t even have to be there.”
Jensen spoke on the barriers that VR technology faces. He mentioned the limits of stereo sound when using an interactive headset or VR phone app.
“It’s weird because you’d be looking at something [different], but the audio wouldn’t change, and video games have picked up on that,” Jensen said. “They’ve started mapping sound based off the viewer’s head movements. Consumer public video hasn’t really caught up yet.”
Both Jensen and Feingold place a lot of their success on the timeliness of their enterprise and the lack of competitors in the market.
“It’s such a low barrier of entry, the fact that I could just buy one of the [cameras] but also there’s not a lot of people doing it yet,” Feingold said. “It took a lot of teaching myself to stitch and edit.”
Feingold expressed his desire for more students to get involved with the technology, despite their lack of experience with VR, and hopes that VR The World can be a jumping-off point for those who want to get involved.
“There’s a lot of people at USC who want to get involved with VR, but they don’t know how. We want to be the place you go to,” Feingold said.

Sophomore Omar Garcia thought he may not go to college until he opened the white envelope labeled “Hispanic Scholarship Fund.” Now a chemical engineering major at USC, Garcia dedicated much of his high school career toward fostering a passion for STEM subjects in his high school and local community, a passion that earned him a Gates Millennium Scholarship and the opportunity to attend USC.
Last week, he was one of 10 students honored as a Scholar of the Year finalist for recipients of Hispanic Scholarship Fund awards, which provide Hispanic-American students with the resources they need to obtain a higher education.
“I remember when I got [the scholarship] I was so happy,” Garcia said. “I was screaming outside by my mailbox, calling my mom and yelling ‘I’m going to college.’ Before that moment, I had gotten into college, but since the cost of going to university is so high, I wasn’t quite sure where I was going to go.”
Garcia spent his senior year of high school tutoring students in the Advancement Via Individual Determination program. For one hour each school day, he led a class, helping his peers in subjects ranging from chemistry to calculus.
“I have always been passionate about education and I want to bring other minority students into higher education, specifically in STEM subjects,” Garcia said.
Shortly after arriving at USC, Garcia joined SCout, an organization designed to promote scientific literacy on campus and in the local area. SCout volunteers visit nearby elementary schools to enhance their science curriculum by introducing supplemental instruction that fosters greater interest in the sciences, motivating students to consider careers as engineers, doctors, educators and scientists.
“Our motto in SCout is ‘To teach kids, you’ve got to be a kid,’” Garcia said. “To me, this means that sometimes you have to go out of your comfort zone to make sure the kids are having fun and being inspired to pursue their dreams.”
This year, Garcia served as SCout’s experiment manager — creating lesson plans, purchasing and distributing SCout’s material inventory among three elementary schools and keeping a comprehensive science journal each semester. Next year, Garcia will take on an even greater role — that of club president.
SCout’s current president, Kristen Zung, said that she believes Garcia will be a perfect fit for this position, citing his leadership qualities as evidence of his potential.
“Omar possesses that charisma that makes you want to listen to what he has to say,” Zung said. “He also has a personable, easy-going energy about him that makes him very approachable. When Omar talks, you want to listen.”
In addition to playing an active role in SCout, Garcia is also the co-director of volunteering for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, an organization that he says has provided him with a strong sense of community and support, especially when outside pressures began to overwhelm him.
“There’s a lot of pressure on Latinos to do well because we are so underrepresented on college campuses,” Garcia said. “Everyone in SHPE wants to excel, not just academically but professionally as well. We know that a lot of people in the Latino community look up to us, so we feel that it is our job to make our families and community proud.”
Fellow SHPE member and chemical engineering major Cecilia Quintana Baez praised Garcia’s dedication to service, noting that he is an inspiration to Hispanic students at USC and in the local community.
“Omar is dedicated to supporting younger members of the Latino community through different outreach programs, especially when it comes to STEM,” Baez said. “He continues to raise the bar for all students, but specifically for Latinos and Hispanics at USC. He serves as an exemplary leader who balances academic excellence with community involvement, all while maintaining a positive outlook and bringing smiles to all who have the pleasure to meet him.”
As a result of his involvement in various service and leadership-oriented programs, Garcia was invited to a dinner hosted by the Hispanic Scholarship Fund last Wednesday at the JW Marriott Los Angeles.
“The dinner was amazing because I was surrounded by this group of ambitious students who all had desires to make a positive impact on society,” Garcia said. “I know all the attendees are going to change the world in some way and I hope I can join them in that endeavor.”

Ever since Nikola Jovanovic first touched a basketball in Belgrade, Serbia, he knew he was going to play professional basketball in the NBA.
Two weeks ago, the forward took the first step towards achieving that dream, announcing on Twitter his decision to explore newfound career options by declaring himself eligible for the 2016 NBA Draft.
Growing up a Sacramento Kings fan, the 8-year-old Jovanovic was inspired by fellow Serbians Vlade Divac and Peja Stojakovic’s performance against the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2002 Western Conference Finals, which Jovanovic and his father streamed via satellite.
“At that time, I didn’t quite understand everything, but what I did understand was that we are waking up at 3 in the morning to cheer for the Kings,” Jovanovic said. “A week later, my dad and I met Vlade and I was able to shake his hand. Ever since that moment I was addicted by basketball, and it has been the thing I have loved the most throughout my entire life. I have always dreamed to play in the strongest league in the world. That desire had the biggest impact on me to decide to test the waters in the NBA Draft.”
According to new NCAA regulations, players will be allowed to enter the draft multiple times and participate in the combine and one NBA team tryout per year. They will also be allowed up to 10 days to withdraw from the draft after the combine.
The NCAA’s new regulations replace a rule which stood from 2009-2015 that dictated that once a player declared for the NBA draft, he would immediately lose his college eligibility.
Under the 2016 conditions, players can “test the waters,” giving them the freedom to pursue an education and their final years of college eligibility or a potentially lucrative contract in the NBA.
Praised as a “win-win” for the NCAA, its players and the NBA, Jovanovic is quick to credit the change of rules as an important factor in his decision to declare to the draft.
“We can explore our options and see what’s going on and be able to come back next year,” Jovanovic said. “[Junior guard Julian Jacobs] is doing the same thing. I think it’s a good thing because I’m obviously really excited to work out with the NBA clubs and I’m going to get the feedback from them to see what I need to work on and where I can improve; the whole NBA experience is amazing.”
In terms of Jovanovic’s NBA potential, the 6-foot-11 power forward-center combination has fierce competition with top prospects such as Israel’s Dragan Bender, Utah’s Jakob Poeltl, Cal’s Ivan Rabb and Gonzaga’s Domantas Sabonis.
Jacobs is rated as the 16th-best point guard in the draft by CBS Sports’ Sam Vecenie. Jovanovic is not listed in the top-25 of power forwards.
Jovanovic remains hopeful, however, that with his current training regime, improved post play and rebounding abilities, that he will garner some attention.
“Summer is the time when you can improve the most,” Jovanovic said. “As with every previous summer so far, I plan to work hard, run everyday, go to the weight room and work on ball handling every single day. Coaches worked really hard with me, just trying to be defensively better and offensively productive and working on every aspect of my game. Right now [the strongest part of my game] is my face-up game and close to the hoop shooting.”
While Jovanovic says his 3-point range and jump shot abilities need some work, he believes he is at a good pace and will evaluate his options and draft projections 10 days before draft time.
During his three-year career with USC, Jovanovic was as consistent as they came, averaging over 51 percent shooting from the field. After an above-average freshman campaign that featured 8 points, 4.4 rebounds and 20.8 minutes per game, the junior forward stepped up his game in his sophomore and junior seasons, averaging over 12 points, 27 minutes and seven rebounds per game.
A big body in the paint, Jovanovic went to the line more times than anybody on the team, sinking 98 of his 150 free-throw attempts during the 2015-2016 season.
And though 11 of Jovanovic’s 34 games played featured sub-40 percent shooting percentages, the Serbian forward knocked down 60 percent or more of his shots 14 times in 2016.
If Jovanovic decides to come back to USC next fall, he is confident in the capabilities of a team which will be welcoming four highly touted recruits, particularly forward Nick Rakocevic. In response to a season without the likes of Darion Clark, Katin Reinhardt, Malik Marquetti, Malik Martin and fellow Serbian Strahinja Gavrilovic — who are all either transferring or graduating next season — Jovanovic was somber, but excited for what the future holds.
“It’s their decision and they probably have good reasons to [transfer],” Jovanovic said. “They’re going to be my best friends for the rest of my life and I really wish them the best. I think we’re going to have a great group of individuals. Everybody’s going to have a lot of experience from this year. It’s really nice to keep some of that Serbian tradition at USC.”
With the NBA Draft on June 23, Jovanovic will be preparing in the meantime for the NBA Draft Combine on May 11 in Chicago. According to NCAA rules, Jovanovic can attend workouts for an NBA team as long as it’s before the June 13 deadline.
Even though he has the potential to be drafted by a NBA team outside of California, Jovanovic said he will keep USC and Los Angeles close to his heart.
“I am proud to be a part of the Trojan Family,” Jovanovic said. “I have always been fascinated by the West Coast, and I would be honored if a team such as Lakers would even consider me.”

The honors keep piling up for women’s lacrosse. A day after finishing off a perfect 17-0 regular season with a 14-4 win over UC Davis at McAlister Field on Senior Day, the fifth-ranked Women of Troy had two players receive awards.
Junior attacker Michaela Michael was named the MPSF Offensive Player of the Week, while senior defender Courtney Tarleton was tabbed the Defensive Player of the Week.
The pair should be used to this by now — this is Michael’s fourth Offensive Player of the Week honor this season and Tarleton’s third weekly award. In all, five members of the roster have received 11 different awards in an accomplished season for the Trojans.
Michael continues to score at a torrid pace. She scored 8 goals and dished out three assists last week. Her 86 points — 58 goals and 28 assists — far and away lead the team. She is averaging 3.41 goals per game, ranking 10th in the nation.
Tarleton led the country’s top defense by forcing nine turnovers and picking up six ground balls last week.
The Trojans went 3-0 last week, beating No. 6 Notre Dame on the road last Monday, No. 9 Stanford at the Coliseum last Friday and UC Davis on Sunday. Their defense came up big in both the Notre Dame and Stanford games, which were both decided by a goal.

Most of us have grand ambitions. Few of us actually strive to achieve them.
Megan Biging, an assistant coach on the women’s rowing team, is not simply talking the talk when it comes to lavish dreams — she’s walking the walk. Biging and her partner, Vicki Otmani, will attempt to become the first North American pair to complete the Great Pacific Race, a 2,400-mile journey from Monterey, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii, that will take anywhere from 30-80 days.
To question their dedication would be an insult. The pair will make no money off the race, with all funds going toward covering the cost of equipment and all excess proceeds being donated to Ocean Conservancy, a charity that fights against ocean contamination.
“I don’t get anything personally out of this except for the excitement and happiness and experience and pride, and hopefully the ability to inspire other people,” Biging said.
Sitting in her office in Heritage Hall, Biging is surprisingly calm for a person about to embark on an arduous and potentially dangerous journey across an entire body of water, spending months on end in the open sea.
“I feel like rowers in general are so mentally tough and strong that we’re able to push ourselves beyond limits that other people might not be able to,” Biging said.
Though neither she nor her partner have rowed across an ocean, Biging has a variety of experience in the sport. She began rowing in her junior year of high school at a local club in Marina del Rey and was recruited by USC to row collegiately. She spent all four years on rowing team, serving as a team captain before rowing competitively in Philadelphia for a couple of years. But a slew of injuries cut her career short, and she returned to coach at USC, where she is in her fifth year as an assistant.
“The biggest thing I like about coaching is being able to bring out the best in people that maybe they don’t see or they don’t believe in themselves, so trying to work with them to bring out the best they could possibly be,” Biging said.
The same can be said about her ambitious goal. Biging got on board with Otmani for the race just about a year ago, and as the months turn into weeks, and the weeks into days — she leaves on May 15 to prepare for the race, which begins on June 4 — the nerves are kicking it.
“The mental [aspect] didn’t scare me initially,” Biging said. “As I’m getting closer, the gravity of being in the middle of the ocean for two months is starting to get to me, but I feel I’ll be able to mentally handle it.”
It will be challenging mentally, emotionally and physically, testing the limits of “survival mode.” The rules stipulate that the competitors have no assistance: no engines, no sails, no safety boat. Part of the description on the race’s website reads, “This extreme adventure is not for the faint hearted and the size of the challenge should not be underestimated.”
All of the pair’s food will come in the form of pre-packed, dehydrated meals, nuts and fruit.
“Nothing too tasty,” Biging said.
The pair will depend on a desalinator — which cleans out salt and waste from ocean water that can be turned into fresh water — for drinking water.
To add to the challenges, competitors will be in solitude for a majority of the trip.
“We’ll all start at the same time, but just the way things work you drift apart so quickly that within the first day or so we won’t see anyone for the rest of the time,” Biging said.
Sleep will be a challenge, since any time not spent rowing is time lost. The pair, whose goal is to finish in close to 60 days with an average speed of 40 miles per hour, plans to alternate the rowing responsibilities — two hours on, two hours off.
Biging, who typically gets eight hours of sleep a night, admits it will be a challenge to alter her body clock both to the tune of the open sea and when she arrives in Hawaii.
“It’ll be just as difficult re-assimilating into normal life as we know it because I’ll have gotten into this meditative, calm, simple, survival mode,” Biging said.
They will have access to a satellite phone that they can use to call for help along with a GPS system. Additionally, they will be able to update Twitter and their blog.
Nevertheless, the experience appears daunting. Though, it helps that their boat, the Sedna, was previously owned by Roz Savage, a renowned English rower who has crossed the Atlantic and Indian Oceans along with the Pacific.
“It has a good history behind it,” Biging said.
Storms are inevitable in the open sea, but Biging is confident in the Sedna’s protection.
“I’m not as worried about [a storm],” Biging said. “I’m worried about the progress that we won’t get when we’re in a storm because it will be throwing us around. The way the boat’s built, we can hole ourselves up in the cabin and just bob around until it’s over.”
Reaching Hawaii at the conclusion of the journey will be a symbolic one for Biging, who will no longer be coaching at USC. Her next step after the race is up in the air.
“I really 100 percent don’t know,” Biging said about her plans for the future. “I won’t have a job. It will be a restarting moment of my life. This whole journey has turned into a, ‘Find yourself and get it together kind of trip.’ So I don’t know. We’ll see.”
Biging agrees with the assessment that this will be a cornerstone moment in her life. But amid all that is at stake — the preparation, the mental, physical and emotional toll, the uncertainty that awaits on the other side — the hard work will pay off.
“No amount of pain or agony or challenge is more significant than the glory at the end of all this,” Biging said. “It all becomes worth it.”
 
What an incredible challenge! All the best to you on your quest.

After the San Jose Sharks jumped out to a 2-0 series lead over the Los Angeles Kings, the images of the 2014 first-round matchup likely came flooding back into hockey fans’ heads.
The Sharks were off to a flying start in the series, having stolen both games at Staples Center and playing quite well in the process. But Sharks fans had seen this horror film before. In 2014, their team was leading 3-0 in the series and proceeded to lose the next four games. It was an epic collapse — just the fourth time in history an NHL franchise had squandered a three-game postseason lead.
This Sharks team was clearly not in the mood to experience such agony again. San Jose clobbered Los Angeles, downing the Kings in five games.
Los Angeles generated a number of quality scoring chances in this series, but head coach Darryl Sutter’s team was denied time and time again by former Kings goalie Martin Jones. The 26-year-old Jones posted a .912 save percentage in the series, averaging nearly 23 saves per game against his old team. Standout play from the Sharks’ netminder, as well as the veteran attacking corps really gelling, ought to have fans wondering if this team could win it all this year.
Aside from Jones’ sound goaltending, the obvious reason to consider the Sharks a contender is because of the top line. Joe Pavelski, Joe Thornton and Tomas Hertl compose one of the most formidable trios in the league.
The Pavelski-Thornton-Hertl line plays approximately 30 percent of the time. When those three are on the ice, the Sharks seem to have no trouble keeping the puck and pinning opponents in their own territory. Thornton’s composure on the puck played a massive role in San Jose’s dismantling of the Kings. San Jose enjoyed a healthy amount of possession, as Thornton continued his outstanding run of form. While Jumbo Joe only scored once during this series, he facilitated play and set the tone of the game.
Pavelski, who racked up 78 points in the regular season, scored 5 goals in the first round. The Kings had no response for Pavelski. He continues to dominate alongside Thornton and Hertl. Pavelski also leads the charge on Sharks head coach Peter DeBoer’s top power play line, in which he plays alongside Thornton, Logan Couture and Patrick Marleau.
Hertl has thrived alongside veterans Pavelski and Thornton. While he only scored 1 goal in the Kings series, Hertl showcased his playmaking abilities. If Thornton and Hertl can begin to find the back of the net with regularity this postseason, slowing the Sharks’ offense may be virtually impossible.
This organization has managed to retain seasoned players like Thornton and Pavelski, but San Jose qualifies as a legitimate contender to hoist Lord Stanley’s Cup this season also because of remarkable depth.
Couture and Marleau anchor the second and fourth lines, respectively. It is hard to think of another playoff team with a fourth line that has a player as talented as Marleau. Pittsburgh comes to mind, with Phil Kessel playing on the Penguins’ fourth unit, but the Sharks’ depth looks like the best in the west at the moment.
Assuming the Sharks can stay healthy, this team looks poised to make a serious run. Elite goal tending and a deep, versatile attack are necessities in terms of winning the Stanley Cup. And after doing quite the opposite of blowing a series lead against the Kings, the 2016 San Jose Sharks have turned a few heads with their convincing play. One of the league’s biggest underachievers from the past few seasons has put the pieces together.
Maybe, just maybe, the Warriors will not be the only title contenders from the Bay Area this year.

The baseball team will take on UC Irvine at Dedeaux Field on Tuesday, coming off the heels of a weekend series win over Washington State. The Trojans will gladly welcome the beginning of a seven-game home stand, having traveled to Eugene and Pullman for Pac-12 matchups on back-to-back weeks. Winners of three of their last four games, they will look to build a head of steam with another midweek victory.
USC has battled through an up-and-down season so far. Inconsistent pitching has plagued them since the start of the year, but the Trojan pitching staff showed signs of clicking in their last weekend series at Washington State. Lights-out relief lifted USC to an extra-inning victory in the first contest of the three-game set, and eight dazzling innings from senior Kyle Davis gave the bullpen a rest on Saturday. Food poisoning slowed down sophomore Mitch Hart, however, and the USC arms combined to give up 9 to the Cougars in the series finale.
On the other hand, the Trojan bats have hit efficiently for most of the season, combing for a .293 team average, and they continued their solid year against Washington State. Four of the nine starters in the USC lineup are hitting over .300, including junior Jeremy Martinez and senior David Oppenheim, who both boast averages over .360. Martinez has also enjoyed a power surge in 2016: The veteran Trojan backstop has already demolished his career-high for home runs (2), swatting five dingers with 18 games left to spare in the regular season.
Despite missing out on the sweep on Sunday, the Trojans grabbed another valuable Pac-12 series win in Pullman. A conference with a lot of parity this season means that Washington and Utah share the top spot in the standings at three games over .500, and USC sits just two games off the pace despite owning a 7-8 in-conference record.
The squad will be out-of-conference against UC Irvine, however, and the team has played well recently when taking the field under the lights during the week. USC has won four of its last five one-off matchups, with a 12-8 record at home so far this season. Tuesday’s game will be the first of two tilts between the Anteaters and the Trojans this year — the season series will wrap up in late May, as USC travels to Irvine.
The Anteaters are enjoying a strong season to date, with a 23-14 record on the year, but they are fourth to last in the Big West with a 6-6 mark in-conference. Their record on the road also hovers around .500.
The Trojans, however, haven’t beaten UC Irvine since 2013 and will try to snap a four-game losing streak against the Anteaters on Tuesday. USC will aim to capitalize on its significant power advantage: UC Irvine has hit 12 home runs as a team in 2016 and the Trojans have more than three times that tally with 34. The Anteaters have pitched better as a staff this season, however, with a 4.07 team ERA, compared to 4.96 for USC.
First pitch at Dedeaux Field will be at 6 p.m. USC will then host Arizona over the weekend to continue the Trojans’ Pac-12 schedule.
The team has wasted some good bats from seniors and unexpected sources this season. Pitching has been the downfall for sure. That is supposedly Hubbs forte which has had nothing but injuries, and wildness. Last chance with the next seven
 games at home to make a move for the ncaa tournament. Good luck to them!

Since the debut of The Pixar classic Finding Nemo, people of all ages have continued to enjoy this timeless animated flick. Luckily, this summer, Pixar is inviting us back into the undersea world of Nemo, Marlin and Dory with Finding Dory. Reuniting the original creative team with director Andrew Stanton ,producer Lindsey Collins and the voice talents of Ellen Degeneres as Dory and Albert Brooks as Marlin, Finding Dory promises another great adventure and certainly the heartwarming moviegoing experience audiences have grown to expect from Pixar. The Daily Trojan  had the opportunity to interview Stanton and Collins in anticipation for the June release of their new movie.
As both Stanton and Collins worked in the world of Nemo previously, as well as numerous other Pixar films, returning to these characters was an exciting opportunity they couldn’t pass up.
“I think we definitely feel like, you know, it’s the burden of responsibility to make sure that this movie is worthy of Nemo and certainly we go in with those goals on any film, but this one in particular, you know, I think we’re obviously having 13 years go by,” Collins said. “There’s a lot of thought as to whether or not the story feels like it needs to be told.”
Since Pixar films, and animated films in general, take about four years to produce from development to story to animation, and Stanton recognized the importance of a good initial story in order to be willing to work for that period of time.
“We knew how hard it was to make the first one, and four years of work, you have to make sure it’s something that you love telling so much that you, even when it’s not working on year three, you’re still gonna get out of bed and work on it. So we had to make sure that this idea was the same,” Stanton said about the process of making the film.
Finding Dory takes audiences on a new underwater adventure as Dory, a blue tang fish with short-term memory loss, searches for her long-lost family and discovers the true meaning of family along the way. Stanton teases the wide-array of new characters and new locations audiences will encounter throughout the film.
“The ocean is a huge place. There’s so many other species. There’s so many other locations, it’s kind of almost infinite. The hard part was kind of paring it down to what would be our favorite types of species to have, but probably our main one that maybe people have now seen in the trailers and photos of is of Hank, the octopus, which is a kind of a creature that we could have never done in the first movie,” Stanton said.
Of the character Hank, Stanton said he could never have been created back in the later 1990s and early 2000s due to the lack of technology, but due to the massive advancements in 21st century animation, Hank, as well as a few other characters and locations, come to life in the film.
“He still almost broke the bank and we got a beluga whale, Bailey. We’ve got Destiny the whale shark. We’ve got a lot of natural sea life that’s around the California coast,” Stanton said. You’ve got sea lions, your otters, your loons, so even though we’re going back to a lot of familiar characters — we’ve really broadened the glossary.”
Stanton and Collins discussed the storytelling process and how the creative team explores unique storyline options.
“[Stanton] always says that these stories are like archeological digs, that you start off thinking that you’re digging for one character and you’re like oh, that’s definitely a Triceratops, and then all of sudden you’re like, ‘Oh, no, it’s a water buffalo,’” Collins said. “It’s such a process of discovery and being willing to kind of let that go or kind of try new things if it is not working. So this movie was definitely no different. It was always centered around Dory, always centered around her finding out where
she is from and where her family is.”
The movie-making process was also more enjoyable, according to Collins and Stanton, thanks to Degeneres. Stanton discussed the origin of Dory and how without Degeneres the character wouldn’t have existed in the first place.
“I was in the middle of starting to write this movie that I didn’t even know was going to be called Finding Nemo at the time. It was just this fish movie and I read somewhere the fact that goldfish have a memory of three seconds, and I thought that was hilarious, and I wanted to come up with a character with short-term memory loss, but I couldn’t figure out how to write it without it being kind of annoying or repetitive,” Stanton said.“ And then I happened to have the TV on and I heard her on her show change the subject of sentence five times. “And the way she did it, which we’re all familiar with now, was so special it completely opened my eyes and I got out of my writer’s block.”
Degeneres, who has been advocating for a sequel to Finding Nemo on her daily talk show for years now, was involved with the filmmaking process from the beginning this time around and had more than 500 lines, each of which she recorded multiple times, which Collins cited as a significant help in the movie-making process.
“So she was a champ and it was always so refreshing when we would hear her read the part, because it just brought it to life … Nobody quite does it like Ellen,” Collins said.
Additionally, according to Collins, the casting department at Pixar even used segments from Degeneres’ talk show when casting roles to listen to how compatible the voices were.
“Whenever we’re casting our movies, we have to have kind of mock conversations, between characters, because what we’re really doing is listening to hear kind of how they sound against one another and often… But the lovely thing when one of your main characters is Ellen DeGeneres, is she has talked to, and they’re in video and audio, of her talking to almost everybody,” Collins said. “So, when we would come up with somebody that we thought might be great, we would instantly go on to EllenTube or YouTube and just say, she must have been with this person.  We would kind of listen and audition voices against hers that way. So in some way, it made our editors’ jobs a lot easier when we were casting the movie.”
Pixar movies are known to pull on the heartstrings for people of all ages, and Stanton believes that the reason Pixar movies resonate with so many people is due to the emphasis the creative teams place on the story and the characters. According to Stanton, Finding Dory’s heartwarming message is no different.
“I think basically identity, whenever I’m writing I kind of smell what I think that I want the movie to be about, then we get to refine and discover what I really care about. And I realize that I felt that Dory saw her short-term memory loss as a burden, or as a handicap, and we love her for it” Stanton said.
Stanton expanded on the character of Dory and the complexities behind her personality.
“I wanted her to see and like herself as much as the rest of the world liked her and all the other characters in the movie, and I realized that it’s a bit of a metaphor for everybody.” Stanton said. “Everybody has something about them that’s not perfect, maybe they put themselves down on, but it’s actually what’s making you special and unique, and you learn as you grow older to own that part of yourself and to embrace it, and know that’s what makes you different than somebody else in a good way.”
While the young children who saw Finding Nemo in theaters are now in college, Finding Dory will provide the children of an entirely new generation the chance to experience the characters and the world that has remained a part of everyone’s lives for the past 13 years. According to Stanton and Collins, Finding Dory will only enhance audiences love of the world of Nemo, Marlin and Dory. When Finding Dory swims into theaters on June 17, people around the world will experience yet another funny, sweet story from the colorful, animated world beneath the sea.

With his radio hit “I Took a Pill in Ibiza,” the spotlight has fallen back upon Mike Posner, whose newest album At Night, Alone is set to release May 6, approximately six years after his first radio hit “Cooler Than Me” came out. To Posner, those six years have been filled with constant songwriting. The Daily Trojan conducted a interview with Posner about how he, as a student at Duke University, came to produce music as his profession.
Daily Trojan: Coming from a collegiate background, how did music play a part of your educational career, especially when it was not your field of study?
Mike Posner: First of all, thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I recorded my first mixtape, A Matter of Time, in my dorm room at Duke University. The only time that the dorms were quiet enough to record vocals was 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., when everyone else went out to party. Those were my golden hours. I think a lot of my friends thought I was weird because I spent so much time in my room making music but that mattered little to me. I’ve always just loved recording and making beats. I recorded my first hit song, “Cooler Than Me”, on a $200 microphone in my dorm room on software I’d stolen off the internet. I released that song and the mixtape in March of my junior year. My friends and I told everyone we could about my music via Facebook. By finals week of that year, I was playing shows at other colleges, and Jay-Z flew me to NYC and offered me a record deal. There’s probably some USC student reading this who is more talented than I. I hope this story can be just a tiny bit of encouragement on their path. I mean that. That’s the point of this interview and this long, meandering answer.
DT: Six years have gone by since the release of 31 Minutes to Takeoff, and now you’re getting ready to release At Night, Alone May 6. What did that hiatus look like and what prompted you to make a musical comeback? How did you come up with At Night, Alone?
MP: It wasn’t an intentional hiatus. I made two records, “Sky High” and “Pages,” which were shelved by my former record label. My singles were selling poorly, and they couldn’t justify investing any more money into my project so the albums never came out. In the music industry my career was largely considered to be over. All the while, I was still writing and recording music for my fans. I released an EP called the The Truth last year and then a talented Norwegian duo, SeeB remixed my song “I Took a Pill in Ibiza.” Now they play this remix on the radio. My phone rings more. Girls smile at me more often now. People tell me, “Welcome back.” I’ve been myself the whole time, so for me I never went anywhere. I wake up in the morning, I do stuff, and then at night I go to sleep. It’s kind of the same thing as it was before my “comeback.” It’s just life. You’re living one too, you know what it’s like. I feel all the same emotions that you do: the love, the uncertainty, the compassion, the moments of being, the pain, the suffering, the fatigue, the wonder and the mystery of what it all means.
DT: Many people don’t know this about you, but you’ve co-written other radio hits by famous artists and bands like “Sugar” by Maroon 5 and “Boyfriend” by Justin Bieber. What is it like to collaborate with another artist and contribute to their success?
MP: I like when people hear the songs I write. I usually write between 50 and 100 songs per year but I can only put 10-20 on an album. So it’s nice to have another avenue to share. I like Justin Bieber. I like Adam Levine. They are very talented, and they are very nice.

I’ve been drinkin’ · In typical Beyoncé fashion, the singer-songwriter unexpectedly released her new visual album LEMONADE Saturday night. – Photo courtesy of HBO
Last Saturday evening was just supposed to be another quiet night at home for me. I had planned to spend this time working on an enormous term paper due before the end of the semester, as well as to catch up on some work that I had left until the last possible moment. However, my studies came to a crashing halt after the unthinkable happened — or rather, after Beyoncé happened.
On Saturday, Beyoncé released her sixth studio album LEMONADE exclusively on Tidal. In true Beyoncé fashion, LEMONADE was released without warning, leaving her diehard fans in frenzy; in other words, no one was ready for this jelly. So naturally, I put my term paper on delay, created a Tidal account and spent most of the evening engaging in a thorough song-by-song analysis of the entire album.
Of all the popular music artists still producing music today, Beyoncé remains at the top of my list. Furthermore, as someone who primarily listens to classical music, Beyoncé is perhaps one of the only artists I listen to who is universally beloved. My love for Beyoncé extends beyond her music; given my almost exclusive appreciation for classical music, one might think that I wouldn’t care too much about any Top 40 artist, let alone Beyoncé. But Beyoncé isn’t just another Top 40 singer; in fact, to include her in a category with other singers such as Taylor Swift or Katy Perry would be an insult. Beyoncé is a feminist icon, and serves as a role model for not only young girls and grown women, but also those needing strength in their lives. Though I may just be on a post-LEMONADE high, I truly believe that Beyoncé is the most potent musical artist of the 21st century, given the fact that she transcends all genres, and unites her fans together in a way that is stronger than most singers today.
Moreover, my detailed analysis of LEMONADE was not done alone. I spent the evening sharing my thoughts towards each song with Matt, the guy I’ve been dating for the past two months. Matt and I have many things in common; like me, he is an avid reader, and our chemistry has proved us to be good match. However, musical tastes are not among the partialities we share. He has been gracious enough to accompany me to a few operas, though I know his appreciation for classical music isn’t as potent as mine. Moreover, with the release of this album, Matt and I were able to bond over something we hadn’t necessarily been able to bond over before. It may be audacious to state that Beyoncé has facilitated a new aspect to my relationship with Matt; however, when it comes to Beyoncé, nothing is too bold.
The “Beyhive” is perhaps the most powerful musical fan base today. LEMONADE, which is speculated to be a response to Jay-Z’s infidelity, has produced not only an outpouring of support for Queen B herself, but has also caused  retaliation towardJay-Z and his suspected mistress, fashion designer Rachel Roy. Though this album has taught me many things, one of which being you should never mess with Beyoncé, I’ve learned that music can unite us in the most unexpected ways — and because of this, I thank Beyoncé for bringing us all together.

Beyonce is massively overrated as a musician. Her songs will be forgotten in ten years’ time. I find the uncritical veneration of her weird and a triumph of marketing over substance.
I love Beyonce. But if you say she is uniting us how can YOU devide  us by saying it’s an insult to compare Beyonce to other women? That is a divisive statement not a uniting statement.

According to the Princeton Review and unanimously agreed upon by industry giants, USC has the best video game design program in the country. Women also happen to comprise nearly half of USC Games’ undergraduate student body and a majority of its graduate student body. Because neither sex nor gender identity really have any bearing on one’s ability to design a video game, these two statistics likely have no correlation to one another.
However a lack of correlation does not mean that Games’ large population of women is not a good thing. After all, the video game industry reaps incredible profits, so women en masse entering the top ranks of the industry can contribute greatly to the decrease of the gender pay gap, which economists largely attribute to a dearth of women entering profitable — often meaning STEM — fields.
So when USC secures a panel with leaders in the video game industry, such as the Head of Game Design at Blizzard Entertainment and the CEO of Riot Games, it has a net positive effect for everyone involved, from the students whose work would be showcased to the women who attend a highly diverse school which is actively redefining the industry standard. Everybody wins, until the top games department in the country cancels the “Legends of the Games Industry” — that’s not me editorializing, that was the actual name of the panel — just four hours before the event because the panelists happened to, well, collectively lack vaginas. The cancellation of the event denied female students an educational opportunity in the name of feminism. This action of “diversity” is the opposite of progressive; it’s reflective of a new regressive status quo to ensure that everyone is equal by holding everyone back.
As expected, outrage ensued. Students who were going to have the privilege of showcasing their games to their professional heroes became furious. More than twice as many students reacted as “angry” or “sad” than “liked” the Facebook post notifying them of the last-minute decision. You see, when most people, gaming aficionados and plebeians alike, hear “Head of Game Design at Blizzard,” they probably think of the colossal impact of World of Warcraft and StarCraft on mainstream culture, not about whether or not said executive is a man or a woman. To further add insult to injury, the only reason the panel had no women was due to scheduling conflicts.
Officially, the event has been postponed to an undisclosed date.
“There was no perfect choice here,” Director of USC Games Tracy Fullerton said. “There was only the choice to stand for one set of values or another. So, I chose the path I believe in. You all are free to disagree, but I think it is the right side of history.”
In essence, “the right side of history” was prioritized over a valuable academic opportunity to advance the intellectual development for male and female students alike. In an industry which is finally beginning to eliminate a sense of otherness for women in games, USC, which has a role at the vanguard of progressivism, has chosen to take two steps back by reconceptualizing gender as an academic and professional liability.
Advancing women’s earning power, professional status and social influence means affording them, and often men as well, as many learning and practical opportunities as possible. Sure, cancelling on industry leaders just four hours before a highly anticipated event may protect the feelings of a few, but it removed a professional opportunity for one of the largest female student communities of game designers in the country and diminished a potential for prestige for the school as a whole.
This is the new dystopia, in which visual representation is more important than the actual progress of women and men alike, in which a word, “diversity,” is valued over real learning and in which snowflake culture has actually manifested itself as a direct adversary of progress. As a woman in a STEM field, but much, much more importantly, as an individual, to this new regressive standard, I say, “no, thank you.” I’ll take progress over preposterousness every time.

The value of the USC gaming degree just dropped. Do you think any of these panelists would ever return after a last minute cancellation because they were not the right sex? Do you think they will now hire anybody out of USC and risk getting social justice warriors instead of programmers? Nope.
I have been in business for 20 years, and such an insult is not forgiven very easily out in the real world. The gaming industry is going to take their money, resources, and time to other places. Count on it.
I’m trying to imagine how the male panelist felt when they were told it was cancelled.  They had made time in their calendars for this, but their voices were suppressed because of a woman’s scheduling conflict.  Imagine if there had been another panel where several women were told to go home because the one guy couldn’t make it. 
The men were second-class citizen’s here.
They definitely second-class citizens.  It’s incredibly rude to cancel on people like that.
I hope that all the panelists, including the woman, refuse to participate in the re-scheduled event and instead organize an off-campus panel that is not in danger of being cancelled at the whims of a social justice warrior.
The key point in all of this is that the cancellation hurt USC Games’ women students.  Did they not have anything to learn from the remaining panellists?  Is it not possible that they might have received inspiration from them?  Could they not have been entertained by them?
By this logic, a female student should never have a male professor.  She could not be moved by a book written by a man.  Her life would be diminished.
The “logic” is preposterous.
Beware of those claiming to be on “the right side of history”. They are truly dangerous people.
It is unacceptable for a teacher to affect a student’s dreams. Her decision not affected the university’s reputation but also her students. If the forum was to have a woman’s perspective why did she not effectively handle the situation from the start and invite a majority of women to hear the pitches of the students. Now the university will have to deal with damage control with an industry that will feel sensitive whether or not to say yes or no in the future to attend this setting. The university, and in particular this area, is set up for business and not politics. I have never written a comment in the Daily Trojan and i am a professional in the industry. What I think was done to the students was horrible. There is no other option than to have her suspended from her role or fired from her position.
She HAS to be dismissed. Her position is untenable, unless of course her sort of bigotry is the norm within the USC administration.
That anyone at USC would use “right side of history” without irony justifies seizing all its assets and distributing them to the very very rich, then bulldozing the site and salting the earth.
Unfortunately this only hurts the students at Usc and the university’s reputation. Frankly there did not need to be any issues involved. Just business. The students had games, the needed money, the panel was the next step. Tracy Fullerton needs to be fired or resign for making decision that affects not only the university but also the students. 
The Students at USC should be protesting for Tracy Fullerton’s resignation. She’s not looking out for the interests of students, but simply in pushing an agenda.
If Tracy Fullerton hates men so much she should be removed from her post. It is clear that her misandry has totally blinded her judgement.
great article
“the right side of history” i really hope he has trouble sleeping at night. game development is a rich landscape and i’m sorry but there are quite a few men who have made fantastic contributions to the industry they love.  discounting everything they have done simply because they were born male, and canceling LAST MINUTE when all of these A-listers had already made work and travel arrangements is an INCREDIBLE display of pandering, and “postponing” probably will not happen after such a shockingly disrespectful gesture on the part of USC.  Way to discount all your gaming students male AND female who wanted to learn something and get fired up at the seminar.
There is infinitely more to gaming, game development, and gaming history than GENDER.  interactive entertainment is about story telling, and to reduce the entire industry to identity politics is reductive and abusive.  right side of history my ass.  when the pendulum swings back to LOGIC and REASON and people remember they are free to think for themselves as INDIVIDUALS and not simply as part of a collective grouping, the world will be the better for it.  Men have grown out of the culture of thinking of themselves only as men, we are empowered because we are individuals.  Women are empowered the same way, and it’s time they stopped silencing those voices.  Being born female does not cripple you prompting special treatment and constant propping up, nor does it require perpetual guarding against offense and virtue signaling.  Women are not infants.  
Stop treating them that way.
Good to know people at USC don’t know what fascism is. It certainly takes a certain amount of brain power for them to think the cancellation of a panel that was entirely within the rights of the people organizing the panel is somehow fascism, just terribly used brain power that helps no one.
Nothing about this is sexist toward men or racist toward white people, so please stop appropriating social concerns to try and pretend you’re the one being oppressed. I’m also glad the entire first page is made up of right-wing bigotry, really makes me feel good about spending four years at USC.
I would like very much for all of you to stop making up stories about snowflake culture and finding whatever “emotionally hysterical” people you can to prop yourselves up as the rational ones in your imaginary war on Christmas, I mean white men.
Cuck
No one cares what you think about anything.
Why don’t you go solve some more of the worlds problems by enforcing mandatory diversity requirements. I’m sure you people are doing a lot of good.
Jerk off 
This is what people write when they have lost an argument. Cameron just handed your ass to you.
See earlier comment.
Oh and people who declare themselves to have won arguments are generally in the wrong.
You’re a nobody and it’ll always be that way no matter what you think or say loser.
You forgot the comma before “loser”. Say hey to your mom for me.
As a game industry professional of 21 years, I’m really disappointed in this short-sighted and unprofessional move from any educational institution, let alone an institution with the massive stature that USC commands. Ms. Fullerton has robbed your students (female and male) of access to true legends (this is not hyperbole) of the industry. Professionals in this industry run — even pay — to see leaders like these, male or female, speak on their experience. And to have the opportunity to meet/greet and present ideas to them? Priceless. The fact that 0 of the 7 speakers were female does not represent a non-inclusive event, it represents the current ratio in the games industry. Put your hand in a hat full of game industry names and pull out 7 of them; you will be lucky to pull out more than 0 female names. 
Is this unfortunate? Sure. But if Fullerton really wants to change it, cancelling a program that would have benefited the women currently in the program is the exact opposite of logic. She had the opportunity to chip away at that ratio, to inject more women into the industry and change that ratio in the coming years. But instead she chose to shut the door on your female (and male) students and thus take away just one more opportunity for them, and alienate leaders in the space in the process. 
My impression of the USC Games program has been seriously compromised; there is a major disconnection between the educational goals and the industry itself, and the students will be the ones receiving this disservice.
Such sacrifices have to be made in the pursuit of mediocriity.
The leaders of the industry should send out a joint message demanding she steps down.
So this is what USC has become?  Males have no voice unless there’s a woman in the room to validate them?
And make them a sandwich. There should always be a woman around to get some coffee and make sandwiches.
When I pull up a university newspaper, to read about the “Social Justice Community’s” newest outrage, I have to remind myself that I haven’t pulled up a satirical site.  The Onion has become less amusing as the gap between it and the real world has closed:
“College Encourages Lively Exchange Of Idea Students, Faculty Invited To Freely Express Single Viewpoint”
It is abundantly clear that there will be less and less education at once prestigious institutions like the University of Southern California because of the smothering blanket of political correctness.  
It is simply a fact, that over the past five hundred years, virtually all the great art, music and literature, what was once the core curriculum of a liberal arts education, was painted, composed or written by people of European descent, mainly white males.  Since while males are now seen as
“white devils” by college professors across the country and the root of all evil by the studies majors, there is less and less that can be taught, all apparently replaced by ersatz knowledge, perhaps written in Swahili or Nahuatl, so it isn’t in the conqueror’s language.
The gaming industry is something as an old curmudgeon that I have little interest in, but this wonderfully inventive and versatile medium was overwhelmingly the product of men and just like the computer industry that made it possible, a small number of pioneering men who bet big on a new technology and it changed the way that young people use their spare time away from work or school and of course, made other technologies possible because of their genius.  If the pioneers were mainly men, it may be inconvenient for the Tumblr brigade, the Social Justice mob that creates their own DOS attack on anyone who does not bow down to their rule diktat, but it is a fact.  
The fact that USC has cravenly given in to mob rule means yet another scalp has been taken by the maladjusted feministas, and another institution has fallen and can’t get up.
Lazy thinking peppered with cliche. C-
Says one of the foremost paragons of lassitude and drive-by shilling. F-
As someone who assigns the grades, I would suggest that you show some respect to your intellectual superiors and see me in office hours.
Dumb-ass comment. Not funny
Not true. It was hilarious.
Where was Tracy Fullerton when these invitations to industry were going out?  Where was Tracy Fullerton when the poster ad was created?  How did this advance so far without Fullerton’s knowledge and consent?  It seems more than a little suspicious that the panel was cancelled within hours of the highly publicized event.  Was this event and its cancellation a premeditated media stunt staged at the expense of students and industry leaders?
To figure out who is in charge of you, find who you can’t criticize.  This goes to the top or they wouldn’t get away with it.
Disgusting.  What “value” was she supporting?  The value that mandates destroy anything that her tribe isn’t a part of?  The only value at issue is non-discrimination.  So long as no one was barred or discouraged from participating based on sex, then the sex of the participants is a matter of supreme irrelevance.
Yes. Ideas are spawned by active brains, not by closed minds, regardless of surface characteristics.
So the “right side of history” involves fucking your students over because of “Muh Diversity.”
Pathetic.
Wow, the cartoon doesn’t even match the point of the article. Did the editors even give context to the cartoonist? Or just “lack of diversity in video games panel”.
Anyways, great article. Perfectly shows the state of USC Games. I’m all for diversity, but canceling events due to a lack of it shows a lack of respect for people who worked hard to get where they are today.
She will remembered on the dumb side of history.
She will be on the wrong side of employment. 
The Interactive Media program has been infested by these lunatics for a while now. Looks like the schism between the film school’s games program and Viterbi’s games program (which I proudly graduated from) has ultimately been a positive for Viterbi, as it shields them from this idiocy.
Fire Fullerton who is politicizing her position
It seems like this is yet another article that didn’t take the full discussion thread into account (with over 100 comments and replies with opinions from all sides) and only took pieces of the discussion to create a very biased opinion and create an issue that was non-existent and tieing all together with a ribbon of “gender.” 
Do you know how hypocritical it is to hold a panel that goes against your vision? When articles and awards are given to you for your dedication to being an ambassador and creating positive change?
For a woman with a vision to make it a point to bring not only more women into the field, but also people of color and people who represent the various spectrums present not only in the games industry but in society in general. Oh how terrible. How awful.
So yeah lets make a progressive decision that some people aren’t going to like but that will benefit all of us in the long run. Lets not just recreate the panel, which the panelists were on board with, and to the existing line up, lets include a woman or two but lets also bring in a black developer or executive, oh and a Latino one, maybe a developer who is low income as well, just to give students a wide range of professionals who they can be inspired by and not just try to impress to land an internship an/or a job.
When you have students in the department, like me, who don’t have anything in common with a rich white guy, who do we look up to? To genuinely make a relationship with, not just a superficial fake smile and exchange of business cards in self interest? I wouldn’t be in the program if I hadn’t had a mentor who took me under their wing because they knew where I came from, understood my culture, and wanted me to succeed and be an inspiration to younger people like me. 
I’m Hispanic. For a fact, my work and success is an inspiration to Hispanic kids because they can look at me and say, “Hey, You are like me and you understand me. And if you can make it, I can too.” That’s what this is about. I’m tired of people making this a gender issue. It’s not. It has little to do with it.
So, I’m cool with the fact that they will make a new panel. With more people, with more representations across the board. To inspire.
It’s not about you.
It’s about sharing knowledge.
No one on that panel cares about your identity politics & was doing all of you a favor.
I hope they all refuse to come back after such a flagrant case of discrimination against them based solely on their gender.
I disagree. It is about me and all my classmates. It is about sharing knowledge but also about making relationships and networking. That’s how the industry works. 
And I disagree with you again. No executive chooses to come to a panel at a school if they didn’t care about the students they are talking to. They weren’t doing anyone a favor. They did it because they wanted to. 
They won’t refuse because they were part in the decision of calling the panel off. And you missed my entire point in the previous message. No one was refused anything because of gender. As a collective, they decided that bringing in more people would make for a better panel.
Of course they are doing you a favor.  These are highly paid people whose time is  extremely valuable.  When they chose to come to speak at a collegiate function and not to charge for their time, they are in essence doing the students a favor.  
All you have to do is to spend five minutes in the narcissistic world of entertainment, to see how film or recording stars are paid to attend “benefit” events with riders a mile long, flown to and from on corporate jets, to see that when someone who is a major industry figure come to speak, it is a favor.
As a professional and a consultant in another business, when I go to speak at to a non-profit, or to a group of students, without charge, I am doing them a favor.  Whether I feel I am giving something back or not, I am doing them a favor, that is why people thank you publicly and privately for taking the time to make the effort.
But that’s a pessimistic and narrow minded way of looking at information sharing. Just because you are in an industry doesn’t make you better than a student who is aspiring to be there. No one is ungrateful. If anything, I’m beyond grateful for all the professionals that have come in to speak to us on a weekly basis.
But I’ll tell you this. Through the program, I was able to get a writer at Ubisoft to be part of my thesis committee. This person flew from Montreal to Los Angeles out of pocket to be at my thesis defense because we form a relationship and they want me to succeed. Sure, technically, you can say he did me a favor. But it’s so much more than that. That’s the kind of relationships and connections we make theough the program. 
It doesn’t make them a better person, that’s not what anyone would say, it makes then better in your chosen field Juan.  As a student, you are there to learn.  Speakers and panels are brought in so that someone younger and less experienced can learn from someone older and more experienced.  A professor only knows so much and has often been teaching for years, so he or she should bring in all sorts of interesting people in the field.  I never charged to meet with groups or students and if there was an honorarium, I endorsed it back to the group, transportation, that of course was fine, especially by private jet, no one likes commercial aviation if they can avoid it. 
This is the problem I find when I visit campuses, finding college freshmen or sophomores who have often never worked at a job, never traveled to any extent and never read widely who feel they know it all, who are going to tell the dean or chancellor to remake the university in their image.  
This is why writers like Hemingway went out and lived life, adventurous, perilous lives, then became writers, rather than attending writer’s workshops.  Now we have film directors like Tarantino who only watched other movies to make movies, where most of the greats had been to World War I, traveled, lived, then made films.  When you get out and knock around the world, you find out how good people have it in the west.
Juan, you are a student there? I’m in the gaming industry. For talented people who get shit done, bullshit like this is anathema. Tracy is a perfect example of a talentless hack being placed in charge and is now enforcing her administrivia agenda on people who actually accomplish things.
Not satisfied with the diversity of this panel? Fix it next time around. That is the logical decision, instead of ruining the day for hundreds of people because  the panel doesn’t have someone with breasts. Absolutely ridiculous.
I am a student at the program about to graduate.
I believe Tracy is human. I believe she has made mistakes. I believe she isn’t perfect. But I don’t believe she is talentless. There’s a reason why her game design book is used in major game design programs. 
Sure, the panel could have just been changed next time. But it would have been hypocritical. I think that’s what really irked the faculty, not just Tracy.
Again I’d like to reiterate that the panel wasn’t postponed because of lack of women; it was postponed because of a lack of diversity as a whole. What they should have done was to create a panel that included a wide spectrum of industry professionals. But they didn’t. It was their mistake and that’s okay. They’ll learn from all of this, move on, and hopefully won’t let it happen again.
Do you know what the word hypocritical means? Clearly not 
Yes, in the real world, it’s who gets things done, who can deliver the product on time, on budget.  Most of this is of course nonsense, there will never be an equal number of any racial or ethnic group or sex in any occupation unless it is by totalitarian diktat.  
People make their occupational choices based on many factors, so who cares of the number of blacks or women or Asians or Hispanics isn’t exactly how it is in society at large?  Are we do order all the Vietnamese out of the nail business in California, the Cambodians out of the donut shops, the East Indians out of the motel business or create a law that fifty percent of the beauticians have to be men and order people from the Philippines out of nursing?
It’s always most amusing that the Diversity Police are only worried about high-paying, sit-on-your-arse-type-at-a-keyboard jobs or glamorous ones like feature film director or CEO, rather than all the dangerous and physical jobs that are virtually all male.
You’re not actually saying anything, just spouting phrases that you’ve heard “it’s about me and my classmates”…
If it was about making relationships then I’d love for you explain why cancelling the panel was a good idea.
I didn’t realize how haaaaaaaard it must be for you to talk to someone who’s a different race or gender then you. Poor you. Identity is so much more important than actual output and quality of work. You’ll fail. 
Why can’t you look up to the rich white guy, it’s his position in the industry you should be aspiring to not his life experience outside the games industry/academia.
Only taking the advice of people of the same race/sex as you is quite frankly a bigoted way of doing things.
The panel is call “LEGENDS OF GAMING”, if that latino or black executive that nobody has heard of is just gonna be there for being a token, Whats the point?.
He is not there because he is a legend of gaming, he is there to satisfy the diversity quota. That shit right there is whats insulting and condescending about the SJW logic in this. 
Nobody cares if the panel dudes are not gonna add you in facebook or becoming your pals and Best friends forever. If you can’t get the success of a developer because the color of his skin then thats on you.
Like do you think any western dude has anything in common with the culture of Hideo Kojima?. NOBODY CARES.
Is not like because the panelists are from your culture or race that they are gonna make a relationship with you and take you under their wing. Am latino too and from the little i know you i don’t think we would get along.
Jesus Christ, your thoughts are utterly reeking of bigotry and ideological brainwashing.
Get a grip of yourself.
He and the rest of the SJW crowd have clearly been sitting around for years in a circle gripping themselves, that is the problem.  The one type of diversity they can’t stand is diversity of opinion. 
From Thursday’s Onion:
“College Encourages Lively Exchange Of Idea Students, Faculty Invited To Freely Express Single Viewpoint”
I disagree. I’m all for diversity of opinion.
But the reality is that the decision happened weeks ago. We had an open forum after the postponement of the event. And we discussed our differences amicably.
And the other reality is that the panel was made for us. Not for any of you. But for students. At the end of the day, the backlash that our department is receiving is irrelevant. The decision happened and a new panel has been made and the event will happen at a later date.
You may claim to be for a diversity of opinion, but on campus after campus, speakers whose opinions differ from the majority view are prevented from speaking, disinvited, or of course blocked from speaking, or shouted down when they try.   When the event is cancelled, then postposed with a different slate of speakers to please the activists of the Social Justice world, the mob has of course won.
No, I don’t believe the event was postponed for any type of social justice agenda. It was a judgement call on behalf of our faculty. Also, I’d like to reiterate that all the panelists were involved in the decision. 
I can say that of course, when you differ on opinion you will have backlash in some way or another. I personally have had a differing opinions with a few faculty members, including our chair. But that’s okay. It makes the world a colorful place. 
What is not okay is the way this has blown up to attack our chair personally. It’s just inhumane. We as a student body are over it.
Of course it was a social agenda.  The legends of gaming were unfortunately white, so the panel was not allowed to speak, the “judgment call” was made because of racism, because the speakers were so clearly white, thus not “diverse.”  Now, in reality their opinions, their life experiences could be incredibly varied, much more varied than if there were register, authentic minorities present, because our diversity comes from our experiences, our values, our thoughts, our dreams, not some surface characteristic.
How is it even possible that you are this stupid?
A judgement call ? Yes a judgement call based on the need to advance a social agenda. The head f the department said as much and noted that she wanted to be on the right side of history. ( which of course means rigid gender based quotas being enforced on any type of event). 
Not true
You are so articulate.  There have been instance after instance of speakers being shouted down, prevented from speaking, blocked, countless.  The left does not want debate or to exchange ideas, it wants a monoculture.
This is why usc republicans opposed Angrla Davis coming to USC? Be consistent. Intelligent conservatives are more than welcomed. Diversity of thought is great but we should be shamelessly elitist in stopping clowns from polluting the discussion.
That’s funny, I assumed the panel was made up of computer industry legends, not clowns like yourself.
As someone often invited to take part in such things, I often also ask a female colleague to attend with me or sometimes in my place. Women often don’t put themselves forward and men tend to select people like themselves for such panels. It’s both good manners and good practice. Too many men- as we can see from this comments section- are long on chutzpah and short on anything intelligent to say.
They oppose Angela Davis because she is a fucking moron. But you do make her look intelligent. Maybe you should help her out by being on a panel with her.
That’s the sixth reply. Angela Davis is considerably smarter than you and the “conservative” speakers who were protested.
How do I reek of bigotry and idea logical brainwashing?
I’d like to understand your personal anger towards me and how it relates to the big picture.
Bob is intimidated because he is not as smart as you. This he is acting out.
I have no personal anger towards you, sweetie. I have animosity towards your bigotry and demanding the world revolves around it.
Juan – you cannot “genuinely form a relationship” with someone because they are white? That is an extremely racist statement dude.
I never said that? Please don’t take my words out of context to create an issue that is not there.
But I am most inspired by people who are not white because, most often than not, they struggle and persevere at a larger degree. 
I can and have formed genuine relationships with white people. White people have mentored me. But do I form deeper connections with people who have a similar background to mine, aside from skin color and culture, who are low income, who are disabled or have health issues, who have not lived their lives in prosperity and who are constantly looked down upon in prejudice? You bet I do. 
“I am most inspired by people who are not [race, gender]” – Juan 2016
Dude, that is one of the most bigoted comments I’ve ever seen.
I really believe you just want to argue and attack me personally, I’m being very respectful to you. I’m sorry that you can’t see things from any other perspective other than your own.
We can go on a tangent and talk about race, privilege, whitewashing, etc. if you want. 
I’m not attacking you, just pointing out your bigotry. BTW, Jeff Kaplan, who is on the panel, started at Blizzard as a quest designer. He was just a working dude who played too much Everquest. He had no game design degree from a prestigious college. 
In that respect, you are far more privileged than he is. In fact, on a world scale, any US college student is more privileged than literally billions of other kids. You need to seriously check your privilege.
I am inspired by whoever inspires me, no matter what their race, sex or national origin.  I am no more inspired by someone because they are a minority.  
Frederick Douglass was born a slave, almost completely self-educated, get he became one of the most articulate spokesmen against slavery and for human equality.  On the other hand, Abraham Lincoln was also self-educated, from the most humble of beginnings, yet he rose to the greatest heights.  Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand was born to the planter class, a patrician, yet he inspires me as well, despite his failings.  
I am constantly inspired by figures from the past, but while I am perhaps more impressed by some of those who came from very modest backgrounds, regardless of skin color or ethnicity, the people who make those sort of leaps can be any skin color.  
There are millions of very affluent, patrician minorities today, whose children have every advantage and millions of poor whites still who grow up disadvantaged.  It’s a very complex world today, it’s changed massively in my own lifetime.  When I was a young guy and spent time in East Germany, I saw just how bad life could be for everyone, all of them white, in a totalitarian society and understood how good people in the modern west have it, even those who start with little.
Great. That has nothing to do with the cancellation of a panel hours before hand because one person got sick and thus the mandatory diversity requirements were not met. That is mental. 
This is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen written.
Truly. 
“University of Texas cancels all-women panel to stay on the right side of history”
Once again, USC makes the news for all the wrong reasons.  Confirms my decision to no longer donate to the university, though.
Good comment below an article on this topic at one of the major news outlets: “Liberals need to uninstall ‘Stupid 2.0’.”
By the way, how much longer do you think USC is going to remain at #1 if it makes a habit of alienating the industry like this for clownish reasons?
USC climbed the rankings when it started becoming more liberal. It’s no coincidence. Look at the litany of stupid emotionality on here from other posters.
“USC climbed the rankings when it started becoming more liberal.”
*Some* of the rankings. And of course it did.  Look who’s doing the ranking.
In some of the rankings by European groups, which place a higher emphasis on papers published and research, USC doesn’t make the top 100.
Lazy answer. What elements of the rankings bias it towards liberalism? Would you include metrics like student yield? Most institutions ranked higher are more liberal than USC.
Of course it’s a lazy answer, it was in response to a lazy implication.
And this is hardly the forum for a long, digressive discussion about ranking methodologies.   I’m not particularly interested in having one, either.
So you have nothing.
Please stop with the inane bullshit
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
“the right side of history”?  You have an unjustifiably high opinion of yourself.
This decision did affect the hundreds of students that would have attended, and likely learned a lot, from this panel.
This woman is an example of what happens when you place vapid, talentless, hacks in charge of people who get things done.
Artists, designers, engineers, create the games and technology of this world. Regressives like Tracy just impede their progress.
And yet she probably earns more than you. Shut your pie hole and try learning a thing or two
Your posts are always precociously fact and idea free, the equivalent of a drive by shooting, rather than an honest attempt to contradict what someone actually wrote.  What the person above earns or doesn’t earn has nothing to do with whether canceling the panel because it had too many white “legends” on it or not has nothing to do with one’s earning.  It’s a non sequitur.
Good Latin. I was responding to this fool’s ad hominem to Tracy, which was totally without cause or merit.
Please stop being a moron
please don’t speak to your betters until I give you permission.
Your posts are the equivalent of a lonely MRA jacking off into the void and pretending anything you do is valued or matters. Yes, I’m responding to your post, but not because you’ve struck a nerve, more because you put a face to a problem festering deep within culture and I’m going to castigate you like the personality-less parroting cipher that you are.
And you, a paragon of virtue signaling, who is unable to write a four line reply without relying on pornographic imagery, like a modern film writer who is so devoid of ideas or intelligence that he has to film each “comedy,”scenes of retching, belching or passing gas, who cares what you post?
You are clearly unable to write an articulate or cogent response to the matter at hand, the fact that a panel selected to represent “legends” of the gaming industry had to be cancelled because it was made up of white men.  
Now, if a similar panel had been assembled at a major university for a course or class that was made up of all women, or all black men and then it had to be cancelled because there were too many African-Americans or too many women, you would be the first person to be leading the usual social justice mob in the direction of the organizers.  
Deciding that there are too many male or white “legends” on a gaming panel represents the rankest form of prejudice and is politically correctness run amok.  
And “personality-less cipher” makes no sense at all in the context of a series or posts and counter-posts on a subject such as this.  Everyone here is anonymous by the nature of the medium, thus not a complete personality, thus a cipher.  Making a persuasive argument is not a matter of “personality,” nor is it a matter of relying on sexual insult or assuming someone’s identification with a particular movement or group that I was previously unaware of, it requires a little more thought and intelligence than you are clearly able to muster with your remaining synapses.  
“We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.”
Benjamin Franklin
Decided not to read that, not worth my time. I’m sorry you have to live as yourself.
Typical cuck.
A lot of people could have learned from that panel, but it was interrupted for bs reasons that have nothing to do with game design.
Would have been better if they had managed to have ONE woman on the panel. It is not hard. We have a problem with diversity on many panels- I believe that there is a humorous tumblr which lists them all- but a little bit of effort would help. Women can give insights in being a woman in the profession that men cannot. It is a shame that the panel did not go ahead, I agree, but there needs to be MUCH more effort made providing guidance for all kinds of people who want to break into the profession.
dumb
dumber
You’re just a no-dick/effeminate, white-guilt cuck. You’re the same as a hippie. Get the fuck out of here bitch boy, 4chan has your number now.
I love keyboard warriors who are probably thanking their mom for bringing soup down to the basement and whack off to brony porn. They read Ayn Rand and imagine themselves spurned geniuses but in reality their only act of great creativity is jacking off into their sock drawer. Loser.
If there was hypothetically a power panel consisting of former presidents of the United States, would it be cancelled due to a lack of gender diversity?  Would the information and experience such heads of state could impart be rendered worthless and unwelcome just because they happened to be male?  Would the school seriously say “that’s great, but don’t bother”?
This is idiotic. There ARE women in the video games industry who could have attended.
False.  Women were invited, they couldn’t come.  The cancelation (and to a greater extent your pathetic attempts to defend the asinine) are what’s idiotic.
She wasn’t  hired to be the head of the PC police.  Fire her
A student should sue the moment they allow an all female panel to go forward as it shows precisely what this is really about — hatred of men. Equality seems to be the opposite of what these feminists want. They’re just bigots who now have a bit of power. Time for the law to step in and kick these people in the teeth.
“an industry which is finally beginning to eliminate a sense of otherness for women in games”
The only sense of otherness they might have had is due to their low numbers of participation – most guys who like games try as hard as they can to get their lady friends / romantic interests into games, but it most often doesn’t work.
And the industry isn’t eliminating the “sense of otherness”, since the only way it actually exists is in their low participation numbers, and that hasn’t really been changing (if you don’t count phone minigames like Angry Birds).
2016 Princeton Review rates Utah as the top game design program, folloed by USC. 
I hope for USC’s sake we see alumni and donors rebuke this political agenda pushing, just as Oxford alumni did when groups demanded the removal of a Cecil Rhodes statue from campus. Look at the fallout at Mizzou and realize you’re devaluing a USC degree.
This is stupidity.
To compare USC to Oxford? Yes, it’s certainly a stretch. The article also erroneously claims USC’s game design program is ranked first by the Princeton Review, though Utah is ranked higher.
You mischaracterize the Oxford response to fit into your preconceived agenda.
Did I not just say that? Foolish to expect the actions of a world-class university to be mirrored at an overpriced California daycare. 
Having attended both, I should say so.
Tiana Lowe gives me hope for the future. Tracy Fullerton makes me shudder for the future. I hope the Tiana Lowes defeat the Tracy Fullertons…
Excellent article.  Denying students the chance to learn hurts everybody.  I hope the author reads this comment – you just illustrated the difference between liberals and conservatives.  Liberals want equality of outcome, so their policies mean everyone will be equally poor.  Conservatives want equality of opportunity, so their policies mean people can rise to the level they desire.  Your article is a condemnation of liberalism.
Conservatives don’t want equality of opportunity. They want to preserve existing hierarchy. Liberals want equality of opportunity and some socialists want equality of outcome.
Might want to call it a day dude. You are getting destroyed here.
Haha. The first good argument in these comments will be the first. Just a bunch of bottle middle-age men with erectile dysfunction who listen to too much Limbaugh and are not very smart
You are criticizing “arguments” while making dick jokes. Also, age-discriminition is bigotry dude. Check your privilege.
It is MY privilege to make you look like a contemptible oxygen burglar.
And its my privilege to point out that if you don’t know the meaning of words like privilege you should not really be using them. Is English your first language?
Also, it is “it’s”. I could give you some English lessons if you can afford it?
Why are you so stupid?
That is the fifth really insipid response to my comment which don’t measure up. Stop spamming this section.
You’re feeding the troll.
So, the next nursing career panel that is over-represented by women should be cancelled too. Got it.
You can’t have an academic panel unless at least one of the panelists is a woman.
Will the converse of this new “rule” also apply to future panels discussing feminism and gender issues?
Probably. There are men studying feminism and a variety of topics.
FIFY: There are “men” studying feminism and a variety of topics
Unfortunately they’re studying (and likely supporting) a movement where the most vocal members hate men (including those men who support it). These vocal members push for unfair biases against men in many facets of life, from education to law enforcement. I’m sure you’re one of the ones who are supporting this movement, considering your previous comments.
How does it feel to support a movement that says if a woman accuses you of a crime, and you deny that you committed that crime, your gender should be weighed against you in deciding who to believe. And I sincerely doubt it will stop with “men”. As soon as the white cis-gendered males are crushed, I’m sure they’ll turn their attention to the males of other races, then the trans folk who identify as male. It isn’t about equality, no matter how much they quack that line. Hiding behind a dictionary definition they wrote is one of the ways they attempt to make their movement unassailable. If they were truly for equality, they would try to dismantle the biases in every place where there is not equality. But they don’t. They push for more biases, more segregation (what they call ‘safe spaces’), more power, more control. You can argue against this if you like, but the proof is quite visible. Although I’m sure you’ll either ignore this or throw out a one-line insult that has no bearing on the argument I’ve presented.
These people do not hate men. This is a lazy stereotype, betraying a closed mind.
This isn’t feminism. It is exactly about equality. And I am a white, cis-gendered male
“Unfortunately they’re studying (and likely supporting) a movement where the most vocal members hate men (including those men who support it)”
I don’t understand why you choose to live in this fantasy universe you’ve made up, sounds awful.
Stop cucking here.
What was Tracy Fullerton trying to accomplish by denying a group of industry leaders from presenting at USC due to possessing the wrong genitalia?
The article says:  “There was no perfect choice here,” Director of USC Games Tracy Fullerton said. “There was only the choice to stand for one set of values or another. So, I chose the path I believe in. You all are free to disagree, but I think it is the right side of history.”
It is my understanding that Tracy Fullerton’s job is to advance the USC games department, not to be a social advocacy leader.  She may believe she is on the right side of history, but she is certainly on the wrong side of her job description. She should transfer to another department if her highest priority is a social agenda she wants to impart on the world.  As the article correctly points out, she deprived a whole lot of women (and men) games majors from making connections and advancing in the field.  This is an embarrassment for such a highly regarded program.
Best comment by far. Bravo.
“It is my understanding that Tracy Fullerton’s job is to advance the USC games department, not to be a social advocacy leader.”
You’d be wrong.  Fullerton is quoted in a googleable article as saying:
“That was part of a huge push,” said Tracy Fullerton, chair of USC’s
Interactive Media and Games Division. “That has been on my agenda since I
 became chair.”
She sounds like a raging bigot.
Sounds like she might be on the wrong side of the law as well.  The article can be found on the AAUW site.
That’s not as clear as you might think it is.
Who put [having more female than male freshmen] on her agenda, her employers at USC, or herself?
In either case, it’s public knowledge that she considers it her job.  If her employer disagreed, it’d have put a stop to it by now.
Sunlight is the best disinfectant, I am hopeful it can clear USC’s games department of the cancer and fungus that is @kinojabber.
Class of 82.
Ah, back when USC was far less academic.
Social advocacy is of course the first priority of almost every teacher and administrator today.  They have been marinated on politically correct nonsense for their entire lives, so any actual education that occurs in the process of indoctrination is a bug, not a feature.
This is factually not true. Have you attended a university?
It is factually true. Clearly you are the one that is lacking in understanding.
As someone who has and does work in various universities, this is definitively not true. It’s paranoid nonsense.
You are part of the problem.
So that’s a “I know nothing about this but I have a paranoid and ideological worldview so I am going to continue spouting nonsense despite direct evidence from someone who knows”. Bravo. Thank you for confirming every stereotype. Why are you SO scared to think for yourself?
You made a claim.  That’s not evidence.  The irony is, that while asking him to believe what you say, you say he’s scared to think for himself.  Yet the alternative is to blindly believe…
  The evidence of our claims is in this very article.  It’s exemplified in the Mizzou staff, and UC Santa Barbara professor of Feminist Studies, Mireille Miller-Young.  Portland Community college’s ‘whiteness’ event.  
The advocacy is in the very claims that they make.  1 in 5 raped or sexually assaulted on campus.  The fun-house mirror view they promote of the wage-gap.  Patriarchy and privilege theory.  It’s professors giving students course credit to attend protests.  
“Mr. Huish, a Dalhousie professor, is perhaps the first university instructor in Canada to award 20% of his students’ grade on “active protest”
“Professor Beth Lueck at University of Wisconsin-Whitewater (UWW) sent a memo to her freshman English class offering students extra credit for attending an organized rally to protest Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed budget cuts to the University of Wisconsin System.”
“MU’s Peace Studies chairman John Galliher and other faculty in his department have publicly recommended students skip classes to protest the “arrogant and stupid” war in Iraq.– and are willing to give extra credit to those who go – and to remember those who do not. An MU Biology professor even gave students extra credit to protest a David Horowitz speech.”
David Rolfe Graeber   is a London-based anthropologist and anarchist activist. He is Professor of Anthropology at the London School of Economics.
His activism includes protests against the 3rd Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in 2001, and the 2002 World Economic Forum in New York City. Graeber was a leading figure in the Occupy Wall Street movement, and is sometimes credited with having coined the slogan, “We are the 99 percent”.

Administrators, including Minow and Harvard President Drew Faust, said they’re committed to making the Ivy League college a more inclusive place. Last year, the school created a working group on diversity and inclusion. It recommended more diversity at the college and better support for affinity-based students groups on campus and in multicultural centers, among other proposals.

 In the 1960s, they began to reflect society at large. The humanities and social sciences expanded rapidly. Women, minorities, immigrants and working class Canadians came to campuses in record numbers and, later, showed up at the front of the classroom. With some exceptions, faculty members and administrators stood behind student radicals and protestors. Many faculty members used the classroom and their writing to support hitherto unpopular causes.
Faculty members, graduate students and undergraduates routinely pressed at the boundaries of conventional debate, often taking their commitment to causes, principles and policy matters into the public realm. The public pressed back, complaining about Marxist teachers, feminist “propaganda,” pro-Aboriginal courses, and overt advocacy for causes from environmentalism to homosexual rights.
 While professors probably devoted too much effort to their university affairs and too little to broader societal debates and issues, the reality was that universities were leading a social revolution, one that had profound implications for Canada and much of the world.
In some instances they get paid (and often paid very well) for this work; in other instances, particularly with community and not-for-profit groups, their contributions are pro bono, with some pay-off in terms of peer-reviewed publications and merit pay. With so many applied researchers and teachers on campus—from engineering to accounting, from nursing to marketing—it only follows logically that the campus life would tip away from “pure” research to more practical, externally connected activity. The idea that universities are now (if they ever were) places where faculty members and their students explored the world of ideas unfettered by interference or influence from external agencies and organizations has been sharply diminished.
While it is wrong to idealize the “old days” into some form of intellectual paradise, the reality is that there used to be a greater connection with the world at large, less preoccupation with collecting the accolades of the international academic profession, and (but only for a few decades) more willingness to speak truth to power, or at least to the powers out of favour with the academy.
This was far too long but David Graeber is great. His book on Debt was wonderful and really destroyed Menger’s theory on the origins of money and Austrian economics writ large.
the problem with social advocacy is it attempts to teach us hate in the name of love. Jesus, Buddah, Muhammad, Gandhi, MLK, you name it.  would all be rolling over in their grave.  THE POINT HAS BEEN MISSED.
Very silly
The Students should be demanding her resignation. She clearly cares more about her diversity agenda then the students.
These are not at odds.
She cancelled an event, just hours before it was set to begin, that could have provided students with important insight into the games industry and the potential to make connections because the event didn’t have any female panelist. I’m sorry, but it’s pretty clear that Tracy Fullerton desire to see diversity overrides important educational opportunities for students.
Since gender is a now considered to be a social construct, couldn’t they have just gotten one of the men to check off the “transgender” box and one ahead with the panel?
Dumb
Yes you are, and your replies clearly show it!
Take your hateful transphobia somewhere else, bigot.
Clever. If he self-identifies as a female, it’s all good.
Oh wait. None of the men would do such a thing because it would mean a life of being hounded by SJWs.
If one or more of the male attendees had only self-identified as a woman after the cancellation was announced, then the panel could’ve proceeded as planned.
Dumb
I’m sorry, was that a rebuttal of some sort?
You’re like a child who wanders into a conversation….
Dumb
Clearly, there is no diversity among the faculty.  Demand that the no teaching continues until the faculty is fifty-percent conservative.  
and yet this seems to be the only diversity you care about…. Strange that!
I don’t care about diversity. At all.
White man, amiright?
“Diversity,” in the academic context, is usually a euphemism for affirmative action, itself a euphemism for discrimination–variously racial, ethnic, gender or sexual preference based–in favor of groups viewed as disadvantaged. In the employment context, a diversity hire is someone hired in part because he is black, or she is female, or …. .
What I find particularly irritating about this usage is that those who adopt it are typically opponents of actual diversity. In the academic context, what matter are ideas. Two professors with different gender or skin color but the same views provide less relevant diversity than two professors of the same gender or skin color but sharply opposed views.
Supporters of “diversity” try to obscure this by arguing that a different racial or gender background leads to a different viewpoint. There may be cases where this is true, although it is hard to see its relevance to most academic fields. But in such cases, favoring prospective hires whose work shows a different and original viewpoint is surely more sensible than favoring members of minorities in the hope that they will turn out to provide a different viewpoint.
In fact, at least in my observation, the people and departments most inclined to favor “diversity” in the conventional sense are among those least likely to want to hire professors whose viewpoints differ from the consensus. What they want are people of the desired gender or skin color who agree with them.”  – David Friedman
Yes, this is precisely the point I have been making in my posts.  There is nothing special about sitting next to someone from a different race or ethnic background who views and experiences similar to your own. Only someone who is permanently stuck in 1965 would not understand that there are millions of black Americans or Asians or Hispanics out living in the suburbs with the rest of America, whose life experience differs very little from their neighbors.  Consequently, someone who is white from South Africa, educated in England or France could add diversity to a faculty to someone from a minority group who is a second generation professor for example.  Real diversity is based on one’s experiences, education, thoughts and philosophy, not on skin color or ethnicity.
“Under the guise of “diversity training,” the intolerance of the political Left has penetrated corporate America. Initially implemented to both insulate companies from lawsuits while fostering a more harmonious working environment, corporate diversity training has turned the twenty-first century workplace into a war zone. Throughout the last decade, corporate diversity departments and well-paid external “diversity consultants” have instituted training programs specifically designed to enforce political correctness in corporations.
The demand for conformity inherent to these programs is undeniable. Despite their stated purpose, corporate “diversity” departments have demonstrated a fundamental lack of tolerance for any diversity in employee thought and have made basic decency in the workplace a matter of swallowing political correctness. Employing behavior modification techniques popular with totalitarian regimes, they have spent the last decade intimidating and indoctrinating employees.
Before many corporate diversity programs begin their campaign of employee behavior modification, a workshop facilitator often attempts to identify the employees most in need of re-education. For example, the opening exercise from a diversity program used by AT&T, Chevron and Nabisco works as follows. When the workshop begins, employees must sit in a circle and give an immediate “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” response to statements provided by a workshop facilitator on subjects such as affirmative action, inter-racial marriage and AIDS in the workplace.
According to the program’s creator, the statements are designed to provoke a “gut” response, so that the facilitator can essentially gain insight into each employee’s susceptibility to the message of political correctness. If any employees’ responses “indicate confusion or bias” or seem incompatible with the ideology being presented by the workshop, facilitators are urged to “waste no time in seeking help from a diversity consultant, corporate attorney or other human resource facilitators.”1  In other words, Maoist self-criticism circles have come to the office.”   From: “The Corporate Diversity Scam”

“White man, amiright?”
Must you really stereotype everyone, @jon?
Yes, because of of course on the most vile and pernicious racist actually believes that one’s skin color, ethnicity or racial origin dictate the way one thinks or the content of their character.  True diversity comes from one’s thoughts, one’s views, one’s own experiences, none of which one’s outward characteristics determine, unless one is of course an adherent of some sort of discredited racial determinist ideology from the 1920s. 
Most of who live in the real world, the world of 2016, in Southern California, Paris, London, New York, Seattle or other places I have landed in my life are surrounded by people from every racial, ethnic and civilizational background imaginable.  They are all just people.  
There is nothing neither negative, nor positive that accrues to a workplace environment, nor an educational one by being surrounded by people who have varied physical characteristics.  
There is a shop I go to when I am in California that has about eight employees, the owner is of Japanese descent, there is a girl of Laotian descent, white female, a Mexican-American male, a white male who is Jewish and a young black man.  No, to someone reptilian, this absolutely random assembly would be a diversity specialist’s wet dream, a model for the rest of the world to follow.  But in reality, despite their varied racial and ethnic backgrounds and the representation of the two sexes, there is little diversity at all, because all of them grew up in the same, small ring of suburbs, went to the same public schools and the same public universities.  So, in terms of life experiences, educational and cultural background, they are all quite similar and so you could have the same number of people, all white, all Asian, all black from a variety of backgrounds and actually have a much more diverse workplace.
Only a stone cold racist, one who should be wearing a pointy little hat believe that one’s surface characteristics create diversity, determine what one believes or how one acts.
Tl;dr
Your a credit to your costume.
It’s “you’re”. “Your” is a possessive.
@jon:  “Tl;dr”
(laughing)  You can’t make five paragraphs?  That about says it all.
It’s pretty glaring. The usual number is 0%.
“You can’t have an academic panel unless at least one of the panelists is a woman”.  
Explain to me how this maxim applied generally and not selectively leads to anything but disaster.
So in the name of diversity, it’s OK to be sexist against men? Suppose the conference had been about hip hop and all the panelists where black and male, would that get cancelled? I doubt it. Diversity is the enemy! Diversity destroys people’s ability to think as individuals.
“Diversity is the enemy! Diversity destroys people’s ability to think as individuals.”
And diversity reduces social cohesiveness.  At least, it does according to research by Robert Putnam, at Harvard.  This idea that diversity ought to be a primary goal anywhere in the university environment, is mostly just a tool of manipulation and guilt relief among the Kumbaya crowd.
Yeah, as much as people like Al Sharpton anger me, the white PC class are even more infuriating. Did you hear the story of the white kid who got attacked for wearing dreadlocks? The irony is that kid is a huge liberal, majoring in Environmental Science, but some black woman got offended over his hair. Really? I don’t get offended when black people dye their hair blond, or use hair straighteners, or bleach their skins. I’m not a fan of white people going to the tan salon, but it’s none of my business, it’s not my skin after all. 
I don’t know how or when PC will end. It’s just too bad that the people with positions of power are PC. That’s why I’m voting for Trump, maybe he can make political incorrectness popular again.
I don’t think you understood Putnam.
“I don’t think you understood Putnam.”
There’s no question that Putnam’s results showed that diversity damages social cohesion, especially among particular groups.  
Making broad statements like yours is a political tactic, not an intellectual comment.
Well he talks about bridging and bonding capital. Both are to be encouraged. He also blames TV for a precipitous drop in social capital. Would you expropriate Time Warner Cable?
It is diversity of ideas that matter, not some surface characteristic or whether the person has male or female sex organs.  Only the most primitive creature thinks that there is some great benefit to seeing faces that don’t look like theirs.  These people are all living in the past, in Selma, in 1963, not in the real world the rest of us live in.
Precisely, Johnathan, it’s the diversity of ideas that matters, along the ability to evaluate them.
Thanks for the thoughts Mr. SellingTheSecondAmendment, but unfortunately nothing about this is sexist against men so you’ve just wasted my time.
Really?  A panel discussion can’t be held because there’s no woman to validate the men, and that’s not sexist?  Pretty sure it is.
No, I’m sorry, you might be pretty sure but not validating men when they dominate the industry is not sexist.
Chicken goes CUCK!
This “joke” wasn’t funny the first time. Some people just don’t get humor; you’d do better just to stop trying.
Another self-hating white man, or a woman pretending to be a man. Lowest form of scum.
Hopefully all the game devs who were going to attend this event end up backing out of this train wreck now.  I wouldn’t attend if it were me.
Did you hear that sound?  It was the value of your gaming degrees at USC falling. Do you think these panelists will ever come back to USC again? Never,  after such an insult.  Also do you think these Legends of gaming will ever anyone now from USC and risk getting some SJW like Tracy in their rank?. Nope.
She just did immeasurable dame to her department and to the students.   If you guys were smart, you would demand her resignation. 
Your coursework WILL be gender studies.  I don’t care if you want to program video games.  Check your privilege!
Stupid
Don’t use ableist language when talking to me, cishet scum.
You are not as funny as you hope you are.
Boohoo.  Write a Tumblr about it.
Don’t use Tmblr. Thanks for playing.
“You are not as funny as you hope you are.”
I thought it was pretty funny.  The only problem, is that this is USC, which means its hard to tell whether @metroid is lampooning Political Correctness, or practicing it.  It’s a sad statement about how far USC has fallen.
As satire, it’s pretty funny, though.
Usc is the highest ranked it has ever been. The bums lost, Lebowski
Ah, you’re @jon… that’s why….
Lost what, exactly?  Do you even know?  
At the same time, are you under the impression that another embarrassment at USC making the national news is somehow “winning?”
“You all are free to disagree, but I think it is the right side of history.”
No, wrong, I am not free to disagree. This is the problem. If I disagree, I potentially put my career and my livelihood at risk due to people like _you_ who have no compunction against using social shaming and no platforming tactics against people who _do_ disagree. People like _you_, who make disagreement impossible, make violence inevitable.
Get some therapy for that paranoia there.
Brandon Eich would like to have a word with you, and Timothy Hunt is waiting in the wings, as is the European Space Agency guy who wore the wrong shirt while landing a probe on a comet.
It isn’t paranoia, people have lost their jobs over speech, and it is just going to get worse.
I think it’s Brendon Eich. But your point is well-taken. The SJW mobs are destroying careers left and right.
Cuck cuck cuck! Goes the SJW chicken!
You are a fool of the highest order.
Says the cuck.
Not as funny as you think it is.
Poor baby.
Stop flirting with me.
People like Tracy Fullerton are all for tolerance and diversity until someone has an opinion that differs from theirs.Then their hypocrisy kicks in and you feel the wrath of their bigotry.
Will diversity be applied to emergency medical treatment? 
Harrison Bergeron, is happening now.
I hope the program director is left to bleed out at a hospital because they cannot find a staff that is “diverse” enough to treat her.
Wow.
I wanted to include cancer going from stage 2 to stage 4 because the onocology staff was not diverse enough. 
Shall I?
I will mock her as she is dying in hospice then make sure her death is pure agony as the pain mangement team is not diverse enough.
Well, if we are lacking a moron, we’ll give you a call.
They’ve got you fam. They’re never running out.
There should be a comma after “you” and before “fam”. Moron.
Not really darling.
And a comma before “darling”. Geez.
I don’t see it honey.
Wow Tracy Fullerton sounds like a total self righteous asshole to pull this kind of stunt. The gender of the experts makes this event problematic?!? So we are invalidating their presence because a woman expert couldn’t make it. What a totally sexist view of what is considered the right side of history.
I hope this person apologizes for putting their personal agenda/ politics/ feelings before the success of their students.
I hope she is injuried in a car accident and they can cancel the emergency surgery because the surgical team is not diverse enough.
You really are a blittering idiot.
Is blittering like blithering but with added glitter?
Found the cuck!
If a hip hop event was cancelled because Eminem, Macklemore, or Vanilla Ice couldn’t make it, you’d be pissed off and you know it.
We already have Dr Dre
That is not the point. The point is that events shouldn’t be cancelled just because they don’t have enough diversity. The football program for example doesn’t have diversity, they’re all jocks. Get it? Diversity is stupid.
Perhaps instead she should refuse to take any medication that were not developed by a diverse enough company then?
There is no medication for “stupid”. You should give up now.
Well written Tiana!
I’m with you … as a two time graduate of USC in the STEM field, I always enjoyed the opportunities that USC gave me to learn … after all, isn’t that why students attend college. It is disheartening that this event was cancelled due to a singular person’s view of the “right side of history” … I’m sure that 20 years from now Tracy will realize that she over exaggerated this concern and that she took away an opportunity from her colleagues to learn. I’d even bet that the three Gents who were going to take time our of their busy schedules to promote their industry aren’t evil … only trying to enhance other like-minded individual’s growth … to those individuals, I apologize for the cancellation … USC is not sending the right message here.
Good to know that anyone ANYWHERE can simply say “I’m on the right side of history” to justify their actions/decisions. What a fucking moron.
Right back at you, Sparky.
You have  a problem with what Block posted? Exactly what?
I’m not a part of his echo chamber. SJWs don’t like outsiders.
BECAUSE IT’S 2015!
Well, it worked for those first fascists didn’t it?  Their thousand years of world domination lasted what, twelve, years, but they all knew they they were on the right side of history until the end.  These “administrators” and the “Social Justice” lynch mob is bringing a once great culture to its knees.  The rejection of someone, their ideas, their inventions, their art, their literature, based on their sex, their ethnicity, their racial characteristics, is always evil, no matter whether its fascistic practitioners claim the moral high ground or not.  They are noxious, vile and evil creatures who want to poison all discourse, to pit race against race, sex against sex and ethnicity against ethnicity.
Hitler said the same thing.
i just can’t anymore man, i just can’t
The most innovative indie game in recent time is Superhot, and that was developed by an all white, all male team from Poland who never had to take a single class on diversity. In contrast the people behind Sunset were as diverse as you can imagine, and all it got them was a trip to bankruptcy court.
Diversity has become a racket. Shit devs make shit games, shit journos praise the shit, and Gamers are left holding the bill.
This exactly.  I unfortunately gave Gone Home a chance and it was one of the worst gaming experiences I’ve ever had in my life.  There are free to play games like Modern Combat 5 that are 1000x better than that trash.  I’ll stick with AAA and some Android/handheld games from now on.
I’ve come to the same conclusion. Diversity has become a social justice billy-club to “remind” us plebes who is in control. The Japanese had the right of it.
It always has been, there is no particular value at looking across a boardroom table and seeing a black face, a female face or a Hispanic face, over a number of similar faces.  
It would take the reptilian brain of an activist to believe that a number of people from different racial or ethnic groups bring something special to the table because of their surface characteristics, right?  These markers do not make us thing a certain way, do they? 
I could assemble a group of all white males or females from eight different countries, regions and backgrounds that would be much more diverse than a group of eight people of different racial and ethic groups that all grew up in Southern California or London or some other area with lots of ethnic and racial diversity.  
There is simply no provable advantage, nor disadvantage to having a “diverse” work force or educational institution, none.  It is only the malformed, maladjusted among us, especially the guilt-stricken young white person who has been marinated in Diversity and other myths, who must constantly pat themselves on the back for knowing people of different backgrounds.  For those of us, like myself who grew up with a wide range of friends, whose friends and families have married across old racial and ethnic lines, its part of life, nothing to get excited about either way.  
True diversity comes from a diversity of experiences and opinion, something that is sorely lacking in the modern university.
It’s not. There is a lot of diversity of thought in the modern university. One reads everything from Burke to Marx and everything in between.
and then protests in favor of Marx, or is silenced.
Utter tripe
Ahem. UMass Amherst.
I am not writing about a reading list Professor Drive-By, I am wiring of the ones who direct the courses. There is copious evince of a steady leftward drift in liberal arts education. There are even a number of professors and administers from across the political spectrum who have formed Heterodox Academy to combat the new orthodoxy.
American universities have leaned left for a long time. That is not a serious problem; as long as there are some non-leftists in every field and every department, we can assume that eventually, someone will challenge claims that reflect ideology more than evidence.
But things began changing in the 1990s as the Greatest Generation (which had a fair number of Republicans) retired and were replaced by the Baby Boom generation (which did not). In the 15 years between 1995 and 2010 the academy went from leaning left to being almost entirely on the left. (The 12% in 2014 who were more conservative were mostly made up of professors in schools of engineering and other professional schools; the percent conservative for the major humanities and social science departments is closer to 5%. For more data on these trends and the rising imbalance:
The dangers of orthodoxy to the academy are many:
We do our colleagues students a disservice by not challenging their cherished beliefs. We fail as colleagues and as scholars when we allow unjustified dogmas or simply insufficiently justified claims go unchallenged.
We fail as teachers to teach students the most important skill — how to think. When we shield them from strong counter-arguments on the issues they care most about, we set them up for confusion and anger when they later encounter people who think differently.
By failing to contest inadequately justified dogmas, we risk advancing solutions that have no effect. For example, if a particular inequality does not result primarily from prejudice, and we engage in prejudice reduction efforts, we will fail to reduce that inequality.
Promoters of these orthodoxies often create an environment of intolerance for diversity of ideas and dissent in the very institution in which free exchange of ideas is its raison d’etre. Free speech and the exploration of unsettling ideas is threatened on many campuses If you think that goes too far, look at this post regarding the extent to which people have been intimidated by

The notion that the fact that Edmund Burke, Adam Smith or John Locke are part of a reading list or readings from their copious work are included in a Political Science class is immaterial. The fact that roughly 12% of the professors self-identify as “Far Left” and .04% as far right, tells you a lot. As the professors move far and farther left, they will of course move many of their students in the same direction.
This is an assumption. And you know what people say about assumptions? I’ve been taught Robert Nozick, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill and Edmund Burke (not to mention Nietzsche, Rousseau and other hard-to-classify thinkers) without knowing the politics of the professor involved. The point is the ability to convey the tools and the critical thinking ability to be able to watch Fox News or MSNBC and be able to critically evaluate what is being said rather than taking all dubious assertions as fact. USC students are particularly good at this.
To add: if the Republicans and others could invite actually smart conservatives rather than the usual array of outraged rodeo clowns, they’d have a better shot at getting students to think harder about the conservative worldview.
Yeah right, is that why Ann Coulter has to bring security when she visits a campus? Assuming they let her in? Universities have a minority of radicals making problems for everyone. I hope someday you add Ayn Rand to that reading list, maybe then you’ll learn how to think as an individual.
Ayn Rand is someone who it has been my profound misfortune to read. Terrible derivative, fifth-rate thinker. Inverted Marx mixed with ripping off Neitzsche doesn’t make for anything particularly insightful to anyone beyond the age of 13. Ann Coulter has been to USC recently, alas, and then her clown show left again. This is exactly the point- it would be GREAT to have some thoughtful, interesting conservatives on campus. But too often these attention-grabbing shills get the invites rather than anyone with something interesting to say.
Funny, I feel the same way about Marx. Marx and his  central planners, do you really believe some government bureaucrat knows how much milk we drink a year and what type? They know nothing, and even when they poll people, people will lie about what they need. They will tell newspapers they want more international news and more serious pieces, and in the end it’s the sports pages and obituaries they read the most. 
Besides, I doubt you’re interested in any conservatives. I think the only “conservatives” you like are RINO’s and liberal Republicans. It’s the same reason the anti-Israel people love it when they find a Jewish professor that hates Israel.
What a bizarre set of assertions. Firstly Marx said pretty much nothing about central planning. You should read his corpus again. Secondly, there is a world in between thoughtless libertarianism and complete central planning. Lastly, I am both a zionist and someone who has enjoyed a great deal of conservative thought. Your use of RINO suggests that you might be a bit of an ideologue, though, rather than someone interested in ideas. For example, de Maistre, Neitzsche, Machiavelli, Burke, Oakshott and others are all interesting conservative thinkers. ‘The Leopard’ is one of my favorite novels. But then I don’t live in some weird Manichean world with goodies/baddies.
Interesting contemporary conservatives to invite? Ramesh Ponnuru, Avik Roy, the people from the American Conservative, Pat Buchanan, Ross Douhat, Robert Barro, Greg Mankiw, Martin Feldstein, Sean Trende, Harvey Mansfield, Max Boot…. So many interesting conservatives beyond the morons on Fox and talk radio.
The only one I know from that list is Pat Buchanan. I prefer Horowitz, Breitbart, Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, and Tammy Bruce.
You’re a zionist? Well, you finally said something I like. Good for you. I’m glad you’re not part of the Israel Apartheid Week crowd. Yes, I’m a ideologue, as Ayn Rand teaches, one side is right, the other side is wrong, but the middle is always evil. There’s nothing wrong with making a choice, even if it’s the wrong one. What is wrong is refusing to think, refusing to make choices, embracing relativism and thinking that everything is the same. I wouldn’t call Machiavelli a conservative thinker, he’s more of a nihilist. The reason I embrace libertarianism and objectivism is because both the far left and the far right believe in some sort of collectivism. For the left, it’s economic collectivism, for the right, moral collectivism. The left wants to force you to buy insurance and make your tobacco illegal, the right wants to wage war on porn and make abortion illegal. Since I want neither North Korea nor Christianistan, I choose the most sensible of philosophies. Whether you agree or not is irrelevant, objectivists aren’t second-handers, we do not live nor seek approval from others.
Yes, I love false equivalence, let’s compare a successful game made in a 90-something percent white country with an unsuccessful game to prove my nonexistent point.
You can literally do that with anything, you’re still an idiot.
dude, go white knight somewhere else
I would be white knighting if I expected people to praise me for these comments, but I’m just angered by stupid people.
Angry about stupid people? Then do something about it: stop being stupid.
I’m not the one making up conspiracies about video games
Neither am I. I simply called you stupid on the Internet.
Tale of Tales were trying to repeat the success of Gone Home, a shit game made by shit devs that got a ton of praise by shit journos, and a lot of Gamers got tricked into buying shit.
Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice…
Thanks to movements such as GamerGate, we are on to the tricks Social Justice Warriors play on Gamers to get our money and ruin our hobby.
Nobody believes this except the deluded saps in GamerGate. For that matter Gone Home was a very solid experiment that mostly worked extremely well. Your attempt to polarize issues with gaming as some kind of imaginary crusade against “SJWs” is only working against you and I’m sorry but you are a minority and THANK GOD. Hopefully you’ll dwindle away, society doesn’t need your toxic presence.
Airport’s Law
Every day another goony beard-man gets the impression that a rainbow haired she-twink might let him cum in her if he attacks gamergate.
Fun fact, it’s called thinking.
Are you of the opinion, then, that minorities should dwindle away and die?
The virgin is strong in this one…..
Unfortunately not, sorry. However, virgins will always continue to contribute great things, whereas you will always be a limp dicked little rat no matter how many people pretend to enjoy sex with you to keep from hurting your feelings.  
Methinks the lady doth protest too much…..
Methinks you’ve never read Shakespeare.
Methinks you know I have……
Aww, poor Cameron, little crybaby.
I’m sure Hitler and the Nazi party thought they were on “the right side of history” too.  What a horrible excuse for a dumbass decision.
And Stalin, and Mao, and Pol Pot. If she had read Karl Popper she would know there is no such thing as the ‘right’ side of history.
Karl Popper is pretty terrible.
How would you possibly know that? Oh right, because he was a white male.
No. Because I had the misfortune to read him.
It is preposterous to evoke Godwin’s Law when one is discussing fascistic practices, especially ones where speakers, panels or curriculum are being canceled or erased because of the inconvenient fact that the panel, speaker, author or composer being banned is white, or male of European descent.  
Shutting down speakers or debate because of someone’s sex or race is fascistic on its face, proof of course that even the Social Justice mob can take a page from the original brown shirts marching in Munich or Berlin in the 1920s.
You don’t know what fascism is. Read Gentile.
Their hypocrisy is cast in stone.  the narrative likes to insinuate that ALL whites are racist or guilty of racism, that ALL men are rapists or potential rapists, but at the same time demands we are careful not to judge ALL Muslims based on the behavior of the deviant few.  That third point is correct, but somehow they feel to see the logic fallacy of claiming all of the above.
GODWIN’S LAW
Yup, because one man’s once-amusing aphorism is enough to rule-out consideration of one of the most important periods in all human history.  I feel sorry for Godwin that his trope’s become a cosh in the hands of fools.
No, simply modern day fascists who hate people based on sex, ethnicity and skin color, which is and always will be reprehensible, no matter how the practitioners of racial and ethic hatred cloak themselves.
Agreed, fascist, you are reprehensible.
NO U!
This ignorant, strawman bit of paranoia is the top rated comment on this article. Please examine yourselves if you agree with this, because your thought process is deeply broken.
so are in some way supporting the canceling of the event?
Fascist ideologues. Noone wins, everyone loses.
We Bobs are legion!
We Bobs do not forgive!
We Bobs do not forget!
Lol
It’s disgraceful. I hope those developers refuse to go. Talk about wasting their time, to keep a bunch of people happy who probably were on a different course and weren’t invited to begin with.
/hug #GamerGateHugPatrol
Stop it with this “snowflake” B.S. I know that you have to have a point of view when writing a column but lifting a whole lazy cliche from Fox News is dull.
So was that your only takeaway or are you just being flippant?
jon is just trying to join “the right side of history”
The only takeaway that I thought merited a comment, yes. It’s a poor column on an interesting subject. Not sure how it got past the editors.
Whats wrong? A column written by a woman not “diverse” enough for you?.
Looks like you are in the wrong side of history.
You REALLY need to do better than this.
How is it a poor column?
I found a snowflake!
bless. Almost funny.
When I went to USC it was pretty expensive, I suspect it’s more so now.
I’d be absolutely fucking incensed if an event and speakers like that were cancelled at the last minute over such trivial bullshit.
Not only is it a horribly lost opportunity for all students interested in gaming, but who the hell is paying the transportation and hotel bills of the speakers who game only to be turned away?
In the meantime, keep fiddling.
It’s not trivial, though, is it? USC should hope that there is some diversity in whom it invites to campus.
They did invite women, it says there were none in attendance due to scheduling conflicts.
Then clearly they didn’t invite enough.
Scheduling conflicts are a tool of the patriarchy to oppress wimminz.
This was dumb.
Agreed, patriarchy theory is dumb.
Holy shit you’re stupid 
Look at Socrates here with his debating skills. Are you really very intelligent? Do tell us your resume.
I didn’t pretend to try to debate you. You’re clearly an idiot. 
I make it a point to never argue with goats. You’ll never change their minds.
I lol’ed! +1
Well with that rhetorical and intellectual firepower, I am sure we’re all glad, “CoryInTheHouse”.
Yeah no one really cares what you think about anything. 
Apart from you. Who keeps replying. You’re not fooling anyone, big shot.
I wasn’t aware that calling someone an idiot online amounted to “caring what they say”.
I would say you’re wrong in that regard.
Anyway you probably are really busy standing on the right side of history. I won’t take up anymore of your bizarrely self righteous time. 
Another reply? I am touched.
That would be interesting if anyone cared what you think about anything which they don’t. Go enforce diversity somewhere since that apparently your job. 
Yet ANOTHER reply. I might have to start charging you for tuition.
It’s completely trivial.
The time to fix this problem, if there is a problem, is not when the speakers are about to go onstage, but at the next conference.
What a huge fucking travesty.
There IS a problem. We constantly get people moaning about not having enough conservative voices on campus (on this I have a little sympathy, although not when the USC Republicans invite morons rather than smart conservatives), but they can’t find any sympathy for countless all-male panels? There should be diversity of all kinds on campus and role models for everyone to look up to. Half the world are women. You can find ONE woman to be on a panel if you try hard enough.
Millennial nonsense, women don’t automatically deserve to be on a panel of “legends” because VAGINA.
I don’t think you understand the argument. It’s not that women should “automatically” be on any panel. Just that almost every panel at USC (apart from our men’s football team!) could find two women to be on a panel if they tried. They would give different advice to men about how to get on in the industry.
What is more valuable to a graduating student, different advice from a diversity quota or solid advice from a highly successful and respected member of the profession you are studying for?.
False dichotomy.
Typical.
You typically make that mistake?
What about hadicapped people? Or gays? Native American? Muslims? 
Where does this maddess end?
They brought in a female panelist, she had to cancel out of time constraints. After that, they canceled the entire event. Asinine.
Found the snowflake.
weird
And the snowflake ought to be more careful…salt melts snow *☆˚°◦☃☆*ヾ(@°▽°@)ノ☸*☆˚°◦☆⛄*
@ moonsugarlily ♡
Oh look. A troll. How quaint. 
Your mom’s first words when presented to you by the doctor.
Nah you’re just an idiot.
Sorry if I hurt your precious feelings. They’re so important after all. 
Way to prove the point of the article. You’re the problem Snowflake. . Get over yourself and Stop Whining.
You’re a moron. Stop being so sensitive and engage what brain you have.
Here we have a SJW using critical theory.
You don’t know what critical theory is. I have read much of it but I have not used it here. PLEASE engage your brains rather than be talk radio ditto heads.
Just give it up. The regressive left lost the battle by allowing free speech to become a right wing issue. And then to make matters worse they decided to make enemies with the only group who are immune to shaming tactics aka. Gamers.
And you know why Gamers are the worst enemy you can get? Because not only can we grind, we enjoy it.
Ding, ding. In the upper left corner we got a social justice warrior with several mental illnesses and a ton of student loans he can’t repay. In the opposite corner we got a Gamer with 1000+ hours of experience fighting evil. Don’t place your bets, we all know how this will end.
Deflection is the primary tool of SJWs.
Did you graduate college?
“I have read much of it”
… this admission surprises nobody
You don’t read?
I only read such BS for fun, and not much of it.
This explains why you don’t understand it.
I not only understand it, perfectly, but I guffaw with laughter at its every concept, and its every practitioner. It gives me endless mirth.
I highly doubt that. My guess is that you have read very little and that novels at the airport with gold letters on the front cover is more your speed.
Well you’re wrong, and ha ha ha to you.
Google “critical theory” and do your best to prove us all wrong, champ.
Already done.
You can “Google”? No wonder you think you should determine who is on an academic panel. Jog on, sunshine.
Wow. Your personal website says that you admire Ayn Rand and the Unabomber. And you are not a 15 year old boy. You fail.
Wow.  Your personal website is a goat.
That’s definitely a good comeback to admiring a known murderer and arguably the worst “philosopher” and “novelist” ever.
Why, I’ve moved onto critical theory now.  Hey comrade, when’s the next meeting?
No meeting. Just try reading some. And perhaps some basic philosophy of science. Popper is very passe. Try Kuhn and Lakatos for a start. But even then positivism is very limited too. Basically just try and get beyond sophomoric libertarianism. It’s intellectually vapid.
Hey, you didn’t get “passe, limited, sophomoric, and vapid” into alphabetic order, like you weren’t really trying.
Critical theory is the academic equivalent of Scientology. Lol. 
Who have you read?
I do not respond to goats…except for this response to inform you that I do not respond to goats. To be clear, this will be my only response to you Jon goat. 
So that is no one. Good to know.
Would you prefer the word pussy or wussy? Snowflake is a polite term for sensitive PC Nazis.
It shows a lack of any intellectual capacity to think.
The term special snowflake comes from Fight Club back in 1999.  The fact that you think this is a Fox New cliche and don’t understand the meaning shows a lack of depth.
It’s existed previously to that. It is regularly deployed by sad middle-aged men who feel like their achievements don’t match up and blame it on mysterious forces of “political correctness”
No, many middle aged men actually have achievements, that is why they despise political correctness, because of the paralysis it induces.  We would like to see young people of merit succeed, regardless of sex, race or ethnicity, not see talented people like these shunned because they are inconveniently members of the wrong sex or race.  You don’t end discrimination, nor ameliorate its legacy through the imposition of a new regime of discrimination.
Unlike economics, collegiate admissions and hiring are zero-sum games, so when a person is given a spot because of their race or ethnicity, even though they would not qualify for the same spot or position if they were for example a white or Asian, then they have deprived the more qualified applicant of the spot.  While this clearly pleases the racialists and ethnically-obsessed, it penalizes others for their race or ethic origin, which of course is racism and prejudice plain and simple.  
“Positive” discrimination is simply the other side of the coin from negative discrimination and it penalizes those it is designed to “help” as much as it does the more qualified people who are cast aside, for it stigmatizes the minority members who do qualify on merit and often promotes the unqualified to the level at which they will fail.  All racial and ethnic discrimination is a pernicious evil.
HAHAHA, no one uses it to point out failures of their own achievements.  Do you even English bro?  The context of the word doesn’t even come close.  That’s like saying stop drop and roll is about Elvis.
Reading comprehension fail
Hey snowflake, why not try addressing then points raised in the article if you have a problem with it?  Crying about semantics is a fox news deflection tactic, stop acting like fox news, snowflake.
If the snowflake fits…
You say you have a problem with lazy cliches, but then play the Fox News card.  Make up your mind!
The snowflake meme is getting a bit old, but of course the reason it exists is because of the ever increasingly infantilization of the modern college student.  To those of us who are older, who have thirty or forty years of live experience under their belts, the modern college student looks rather pathetic.  
We are intelligent enough to know that for every member of the Social Justice mob who spends their days on Tumblr and Twitter, tweeting and twitting away about “White Privilege,” and storming into the dean’s office with a list of demands, there are others who are actually taking a course load that may lead to actual employment and a positive contribution to society.
On the other hand, through the pernicious efforts of the left, the modern educational system, the college campus has gradually been turned into a leftist seminary where people are thoroughly educated in the left’s world view.  There is virtually no range of opinion in the liberal arts any more, with almost every university faculty ranging from left to far left, a ratio of ten, twenty, thirty to one, left versus conservative.  This myopic world view is not healthy for the nation, nor the students, that is why even some left of center professors and educators, serious people, feel it has to be changed.
Once this left world view is instituted, it then creates this type of world, what people are calling “special snowflakes,” students who simply will not tolerate opposing views, who cannot handle being opposed.  The “safe spaces,” where these overly sensitive bullies (that is one of their accomplishments, creating people who will shout others down and then run for a safe room, the “Crybully” meme) go hug plush toys when confronted with an idea they don’t like.  This movement has gone so far as to label ideas they don’t like as “threatening” and “violent,” when they are of course nothing of the kind.  
So, yes, this snowflake meme is endlessly repeated, but it sums up a very real movement that is seen on campuses on a weekly basis, whenever someone comes to speak in opposition to the left world view.  They want to prevent speech they don’t like, to speak over others, to drown them out, to block doors, entrances, roadways, rather than engaging in debate.  The free exchange of ideas was the goal when the modern university was evolving during the 19th century, not the prevention of debate, but that is where we are at now.
This is both totally inaccurate and displays a serious paranoia that demands medical intervention. Get help.
Yes, another leftist shill, incapable of intelligent thought or debate, you have proved my points, bravo!
Seriously, though. Do get help. You are so easily threatened by people different to you.
“Threatened?”  Sorry, that is one of your leftist code words, none of you people intimidate or threaten me, I can take care of myself.  The left is the ones who are generally threatened by free and open debate and who attempt to keep opposing ideas out.
Not true. I regularly read conservative thinkers and columnists. This is more often not the case with conservatives. Indeed studies have shown that they are prone to cognitive closure when they come across inconvenient facts. You are threatened by me in this comment section as you can tell by how defensive you are getting. The lady doth protest too much.

Last week, the USC School of Cinematic Arts’ Interactive Media and Games Division announced that it would be postponing a “Legends of the Game Industry” panel because of its failure to reflect the diversity within the University and the gaming industry more broadly. The cancellation of the panel, which featured only male panelists, was met with mixed responses from potential attendees who responded to the postponement, ranging from praise to frustration.
Though it is understandable that some students may have been disappointed by the last-minute cancellation, the postponement of the panel reflects an appreciation for diversity on the part of the University that should be celebrated, not condemned.
On Wednesday, Professor Anthony Borquez posted a letter to event attendees via Facebook informing them of the program’s cancellation. In addition to explaining that the panel as it stood did not reflect the diversity within both the University community and the games industry, Borquez also assured attendees of the Interactive Media and Games Division’s intent to reschedule the panel in the coming weeks — next time with a more balanced group of panelists.
The postponement prompted an array of reactions, with many students taking to the comments section of the post to voice their opinion on the cancellation. Though a majority of the commenters acknowledged the importance of diversity and inclusion on panels such as these, several voiced frustration with the last-minute cancellation of the event. Others, however, praised the decision, highlighting the fact that the event wasn’t canceled, but simply postponed.
Though it is understandable that some students may have been disappointed with the last-minute postponement of the panel — particularly one that included a number of representatives from top video game developers — the University was right in its decision to ensure that its programming represented the diversity of the industries to which it hopes to send its students. As the long-standing top game design school in North America, USC has a responsibility to help further the diversification of the games industry. It cannot in good faith market programming that disregards the very diversity and inclusivity that it seeks to promote.
Diversity is not an issue unique to this panel alone. In fact, it is one that is endemic to the gaming industry as a whole. As an industry historically geared toward the very narrow demographic of traditional gamers — namely white, straight males — the very game developers who have been tasked with designing these games have largely come from that same demographic. A 2005 study by the International Game Developers Association found that approximately 83 percent of game development workers are white, boasting very little representation among Asian (7.5 percent), Hispanic (2.5 percent) and African American (2 percent) developers. Though these numbers have improved marginally, the industry still suffers from a clear lack of gender and racial diversity.
Though improvement has certainly been slow, the games development industry is changing — and the University’s programming should reflect that. This certainly isn’t a shift that USC has ignored. In fact, the University has already begun to offer new classes to address broadening diversity within the games industry, including offering courses which focus on issues of gender and sexuality in gaming.
Significant change in the industry certainly won’t happen overnight, and meeting the demand for more diversity and inclusivity within it will require a concerted effort by all involved to ensure that such diversity is promoted and maintained. By rescheduling the panel to include a broader and more realistic view of where the industry can and should be heading in the future, the University is doing just that.
Yasmeen Serhan is a senior majoring in international relations. “Point/Counterpoint” ran Tuesdays.
The key point in the panel cancellation is that the cancellation hurt USC Games’ women students. Did they not have anything to learn from the remaining panellists? Is it not possible that they might have received inspiration from them? Could they not have been entertained by them?
By this logic, a female student should never have a male professor. She could not be moved by a book written by a man. Her life would be diminished.
The “logic” is preposterous.
“Though a majority of the commenters acknowledged the importance of diversity and inclusion on panels such as these, several voiced frustration with the last-minute cancellation of the event. Others, however, praised the decision, highlighting the fact that the event wasn’t canceled, but simply postponed.”
This is patently, blatantly, and easily provably false, and I’m surprised the author would be bold enough to assert it as a fact.  One glance at the comments section for that post shows the response was overwhelmingly,  near universally negative.  
To pretend the “majority” of the comment community for that post supports the decision is disingenuous at best and manipulative at worst.
I was just going to make exactly the same observation. This writer is extremely  disingenuous.
As a game industry professional of 21 years, I’m really disappointed in this short-sighted and unprofessional move from any educational institution, let alone an institution with the massive stature that USC commands. Ms. Fullerton has robbed your students (female and male) of access to true legends (this is not hyperbole) of the industry. Professionals in this industry run — even pay — to see leaders like these, male or female, speak on their experience. And to have the opportunity to meet/greet and present ideas to them? Priceless. The fact that 0 of the 7 speakers were female does not represent a non-inclusive event, it represents the current ratio in the games industry. Put your hand in a hat full of game industry names and pull out 7 of them; you will be lucky to pull out more than 0 female names. You say you want a discussion panel with a micro sample size of the industry to reflect diversity of the industry? 7 males and no females did just that. By brute-forcing more females into the event you’ve actually artificially skewed the reality of game companies. Claiming it was a “decision to ensure that its programming represented the diversity of the industries to which it hopes to send its students” reflects either complete ignorance or a bold-faced lie. The industry is not gender-diverse. And the reason is almost entirely not due to sexism.
Is this unfortunate? Sure. But if Fullerton really wants to change it, cancelling a program that would have benefited the women currently in the program is the exact opposite of logic. She had the opportunity to chip away at that ratio, to inject more women into the industry and change that ratio in the coming years. But instead she chose to shut the door on your female (and male) students and thus take away just one more opportunity for them, and alienate leaders in the space in the process. This, by definition, is a sexist and discriminatory decision. 
My impression of the USC Games program has been seriously compromised; there is a major disconnection between the educational goals and the industry itself, and the students will be the ones receiving this disservice.
I appreciate your industry, huge fan of Fallout 4, Hitman Absolution, Grand Theft Auto, and other M-rated games, Manhunt was excellent in spite of the censorship. 
For all the talk about more women playing games, I just don’t see it. If I go to a Games Spot or EB Games, it’s a male crowd whether it’s the teenager with pimples or the fat 40-year-old that loves how wonderful games have become. The only women I see are mothers and maybe a few sales clerks. 
Women are just different than men, for every tomboy there’s gonna be 10 ice queens. The military is a great example of this, the number of women in the military is microscopic, and most of them go to typical female professions like nursing, administration, HR. For the rare woman that graduates from the Ranger course or flies an F16, most don’t want to do that. Now that there’s talk of opening draft registration to women, the feminists are actually protesting.
I agree with the author.  For example, I attended a feminist conference on patriarchy in the gaming industry.  However, when we noticed that there were no male attendees, we felt it only right to postpone the conference because of the dearth of male voices.
Isn’t this a direct violation of Title IX?  An all-star panel was “excluded from participation in” and “subjected to discrimination under” a “education program… receiving Federal financial assistance” solely and admittedly “on the basis of sex.”
I am not a lawyer, but Director Fullerton’s decision to stand with her Whig theory of history against her actual flesh-and-blood students wasn’t just morally wrong and a dereliction of her duty — it looks a bit illegal to me.
The value of the USC gaming degree just dropped.  Do you think any of these panelists would ever return after a last minute cancellation because they were not the right sex?  Do you think they will now hire anybody out of USC and risk getting social justice warriors instead of programmers? Nope. 
I have been in business for 20 years, and such an insult is not forgiven very easily out in the real world.  The gaming industry is going to take their money, resources, and time to other places.  Count on it.
No it’s not important. If the conference had been about feminism and they could only find female feminists to attend, the conference would have gone on.  
Anthony Borquez is an idiot. Most video games are played by men, designed by and for men, with stories that appeal to men.   
Diversity is overrated, instead of celebrating differences is punishes people for not being different. Instead of allowing a wide variety of viewpoints, it only tolerates one viewpoint and damns everyone else to hell. 
Students deserve CHOICE! If one group wants to bring Michael Moore while another group brings Ann Coulter, both should get their wish and protestors should be kept outside. We don’t need the Diversity Nazis telling us what to say and what to do. We are not slaves! We are taxpayers and we deserve public universities that don’t cancel events over BS like diversity.
So… is it USC’s official position, then, that males have no voice unless there’s a woman in the room to validate them?
Where is the demand for diversity in the faculty in regards to political viewpoints?  Why do you not demand classes be postponed until there is an equal number of conservative professors?  Why demand a diversity of organs, but not a diversity of thought?
Silly argument.  If you want women to be more represented in an industry that has been dominated by men, then you have to let them listen to men.  Closing people’s eyes and ears helps no one.  Denying women opportunities hurts women, do you not understand that?  How is this any different than Afghanistan not allowing women to attend school?  You are basically using the same argument ISIS uses.
Did you consider maybe asking some of the men to “self-identify” as women so that the event could go on?
Right, and if I wanted to become a nurse, I would have to attend nursing events full of women. I would not get upset if all the panelists were female. If it’s my chosen profession, then I know that’s part of the deal.
I’m sorry, when you tell a bunch of experts to go away because they don’t have your approved mix of sexual organs, that’s called “sexism”.

When a recipe calls for chicken, pasta, veggies or cheese, I nod my head thinking, “Got it, got it, got it and got it.” But when moving to the bottom half of a recipe and noticing it calls for common herbs such as parsley, basil or oregano, I think, “Don’t got any of that.” I, for far too long, was deterred from preparing recipes that called for a long list of ingredients because being a college student, I normally don’t have a bountiful supply of fresh herbs on hand nor the pocket change to buy bunches of cilantro and mint.
And then I realized, the solution to end the shortage of recipe ingredients along with save money was to start my own indoor garden. By growing some common herbs such as chives or basil, I could easily save myself a trip to the grocery store, try out more recipes and best. I could experience that Christmas morning excitement when you go to check on the progress of your plants (me every morning). 
“I just ordered a bag of soil on Amazon,” I tell a friend only to get the confused and “What do you need dirt for?” look. All you really need to start your own gardening project are a few supplies: rich, nutrient-filled soil, seeds, water and some type of pot or jar. Mason jars are a fun alternative to the traditional plant pot, but glass jars can stifle proper drainage and can lead to root rot. If using glass jars or containers, you can drill a hole at the bottom or simply fill about ¼ of the jar with rocks or pebbles to allow the water from the soil to drain. 
Some seeds might need to germinate in water first. Germination often takes a few hours or overnight depending on the seed. You can look up seed specific information or the packet of seeds you have might give you more information like mine did. I found a muffin pan slightly filled with water was a great and easy tool to separately place seeds into little sections of water to germinate.

After you have your pot situation figured out, add soil or layer on top of your rocks or pebbles leaving room at the top. Add in your germinated seeds and add soil on top slightly packing down. Place on or near a window where your seeds will receive a large amount of sunlight per day. Water when the soil appears dry but be careful to not drown your plants. 
Though gardening can be tricky and difficult to not mess up, I have no green thumb whatsoever but currently have a windowsill of growing herbs somehow. I’m sure there are way more intricate steps and tips for gardening success, but honestly, as a busy college student, all I have time or effort for is throwing some dirt and seeds into a container. Do not be discouraged if they take a few days or weeks to sprout as some of my seeds sprouted in a few days while the others took two weeks. 
Note: Basil has been the most successful herb in our apartment as it appears to be pretty resilient. I gave my roommate a basil plant for her birthday last August, and though it’s seen better days, it’s still going strong, standing over a foot tall soaking up water and sunlight daily. Parsley and cilantro have proven to be trickier, growing more slowly, while my chives suddenly sprouted and grew inches in a mere week or so. 
Having your own garden of herbs indoors is perfect for adding flavors to your dishes and is simpler than you think. Good luck gardening, Trojans!

It’s Thursday night and the Shrine is packed full for a sold-out show. The audience is getting restless, waiting for someone to take to the stage. That someone is Canadian-born Claire Boucher, better know as synth-pop artist, Grimes.
The April 21 performance featured female-fronted openers Tei Shi, a Brooklyn-based pop/R&B singer, and French group Christine and the Queens. Both Tei Shi and Christine and the Queens musically and cohesively built each other up, perfectly setting the stage for Grimes’ arrival. Having all-female leads perform was inspirational and moving, and a total call for girl power.
Tei Shi took stage to an eager crowd, performing several songs from her most recent EP, Verde, which debuted in 2015. Songs like “See Me,” “Go Slow” and “Bassically” set a relaxed yet pumped tone that listeners totally vibed to. Her stylistically unique sound and angelic voice successfully gave the audience a precedent for what was to come later in the night.
As the evening progressed with anticipation, Christine and the Queens came on next. Dressed in all black, members of Christine and the Queens resembled a mixture between spies and something out of Vogue. Frontwoman Héloïse Letissier, along with her backup dancers, presented an aura of creativity mixed with subtle sexuality and passion. Through energetic choreography, an infusion of French and English lyrics and a mashup of some of Kanye West’s “Heartless,” the crowd embraced the liveliness and vibrancy that Christine and the Queens presented.
Letissier was authentic and true to herself. Towards the end of her set, she left the crowd with words of wisdom, expressing, “I believe in many ways to exist.” Her time on stage was not only full of energy and animated music, but also a message underlying the promotion of self-love, expression and acceptance, paralleling to several songs she performed that night. 
Finally, the lights dimmed and the classical music that had played in between sets subsided. Backup dancer Alyson Van came out on stage performing solo choreography to introduce Grimes, backup vocals Hana Pestle and fellow backup dancer Linda Davis.
Grimes, with shaggy pink hair and a welcoming demeanor, took to her musical platform of gadgets and gizmos, switching on buttons to create a mixture of sounds. She started off the show strong with “Realiti” from her newest album Art Angels, and transitioned into a crowd favorite “Genesis” from her 2012 album, Visions.
Throughout her performance, Grimes appeared comfortable with her stage and listeners, making for a personable experience. She interacted well with her backup dancers and backup vocals. While it was her show, Grimes didn’t make the performance entirely about her. With the incorporation of dancers, Van and Davis, along with Pestle, everyone on stage contributed in their own unique way, collectively making for an amazing show. 
What made Grimes’ show special was how raw and real she was in her expression and personality. Though there were a few mishaps involving the volume of her mic, as well as a bass that at times overpowered vocals, the production level Grimes presented was high-quality and professional. While maintaining professionalism, this didn’t stop her from being playful, quirky and interactive with the audience.
At one point, she had forgotten the lyrics to “World Princess Part II,” even saying during the song she didn’t remember the words. It was an instance like this that really clicked among the crowd in that no one booed or criticized her; rather, everyone applauded and cheered for her to keep going. This moment gave a realization that even artists as imperfectly perfect as Grimes make mistakes here and there, and that’s what makes people human. It was clear that everyone in the room was experiencing Grimes in their own way, and though interpretations might have differed from person to person, everyone was there in support of Grimes and her music.
Grimes was free and angsty and at times even chaotic with little howls and growls, yet she was also mesmerizing and delicate, exactly how one would imagine an art angel to be. She was sweet, soft-spoken and humble when she addressed the audience in between songs, and made sure to shout out those who had helped her get to where she is today. 
Though the whole night was a beautiful time, highlights from Grimes’ performance included (but were not limited to) “Venus Fly,” and “Go.” The entire Shrine went hard, wildly dancing along to the beat that electrified the whole room. 
In an unconventional and unorthodox way, Grimes concluded the show without a traditional encore, where the performer leaves the stage only to come back on a few moments later. Grimes explained that if she were to do it the traditional way, she’d feel too panicked to come back on stage. This only kept the audience momentum going. So Grimes concluded the night with upbeat song, “Kill V. Maim.” Grimes started strong and ended strong. 
After the show had ended, everyone began to skirt their way out, only to come to a stop when a song from the late Prince had begun to play. A fitting tribute to the legend who had only just passed away, “Let’s Go Crazy,” boomed and the crowd began to dance. It was a way of mourning for many, but also a celebration of music and love, for Tei Shi, for Christine and the Queens, for Grimes and for Prince.

Looking back, what has surprised you most about college? Based on your answer, do you have any advice?
I chose to answer this question with every intention of devising some heartwarming and profound revelation as a convenient conclusion to this column. When it came time to brainstorm my answer, however, I found myself stymied, unable to conjure up the gooey feelings of devotion to my future alma mater that would have wrapped up this blog with a lovely cardinal and gold bow.
Lately, people have been asking me how I feel going into the last couple weeks of my undergraduate education. I am increasingly sad at the prospect of separating from my friends, who are some of the most admirable, good-hearted people I have ever met. But I am absolutely apathetic about leaving USC, the institution. Excited, even.
The biggest surprise of my college experience has been my ultimate lack of pride in being a Trojan; truthfully, I didn’t always feel this way. Coming to USC as a freshman, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I was so proud of my school. I even non-ironically used the phrase “FTFO” (classic freshman move). 
Immediately upon my arrival in the dorms, I learned that everyone was rushing, and I should too if I wanted to have a thriving social life. “Are you in a house?” was a question regularly asked within the first five minutes of meeting someone new, facilitating a divide between greeks and non-greek “Goddamn Independents,” known more colloquially as “GDIs.” Living among freshmen on campus, I learned that many people drank at least three nights a week — Wine Wednesday, Thirsty Thursday, Friday day-gers, Saturday registers — and that our administration just slapped some wrists for the regularly scheduled hospital transports of alcohol poisoned partygoers. At some point during my college career, USC Athletics even encouraged its students to #turnupSC.
Persistent generic notions of “coolness” at USC include routine blackouts, hazing and flaunting wealth. Things that don’t seem cool include whistleblowing and holding opinions contrary to the prevailing groupthink constructed by the administration and perpetuated by the students — that being at USC was better than being a plebeian at any other school. As a less malleable (and much less self-conscious) upperclassman, I know better than to strive for “cool.” This newfound maturity has led me to see beyond our retrogressive social norms, and has resulted in my frustration about persisting tepid sentiments toward social progress on our campus.
This year has included frustrating conversations with peers that didn’t believe USC needed the Campus Climate Resolution, and with friends who did not feel comfortable walking out of class to #StandwithMizzou. The administration has continued to infuriate me with inadequate action on Title IX and our ugly sexual assault epidemic, infidelity to environmental sustainability by means of unholy matrimony to fossil fuel investment and lackluster responses to students’ pleas for reasonable mental health resources.
Having unleashed a diatribe in response to your well-intentioned “Ask Tiffany” submission, you probably gather I have hated the past four years. In reality, USC has gifted me with irreplaceable friends with whom I share experiences that have been the catalyst for immense self-growth. I advise you to look for your people, because they are here, sometimes in less obvious places. For me, these people were in my dorm, at my on-campus job –shout out to Ground Zero– and in student organizations like Women and Youth Supporting Each Other (WYSE) and Spark SC.
Looking back, however, I wish I had never sipped the Kool-Aid spiked with Arrogant Nation pride. Because of this, I further advise you to speak up about the problems you see at our school, and keep our administration accountable for acting in the best interests of its students.
The easy thing to do is to acknowledge the issues USC has, but do nothing about them. While it is impossible to be a righteous warrior all of the time, recognize that even inaction constitutes complicity. Progress, for me, was dropping my sorority after I realized that even being “the worst sorority girl” still supported the social structure of classism, archaic gender norms, misogyny and unwarranted superiority complexes. While actions speak louder than words, words speak louder than bystander silence. As students, we are USC’s primary customers, and have buyer bargaining power to affect change. Be true to your school (just like you would to your girl or guy or person) by asking yourself what needs to be changed to make our University better, and find the courage to do something about it. Everyone deserves an alma mater that they are proud to have attended.
