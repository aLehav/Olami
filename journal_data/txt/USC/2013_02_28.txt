Pope Benedict XVI officially stepped down from his post as head of the church Thursday, becoming the first pope in 600 years to do so.
Though the announcement shocked many Catholic students, they praised the pope for having the courage and humility to recognize that he could no longer be an effective leader of the church.
“I think he made the right judgment call to say ‘I’m supposed to be a servant of the church, I’m supposed to be a leader of the church and find God’s will and I can’t do it right now,’” said Edwin Juarez Rosales, a second-year doctorate student in electrical engineering who was raised Catholic. “It’s better for him to be humble enough to say ‘Let me go and rest.’”
Sergio Avelar, a senior majoring in environmental studies, said he was unsure whether the pope stepped down for health reasons or because of the recent problems plaguing the church involving the child abuse scandals. He agreed that the Pope’s decision, however, was a noble act.
“It was very surprising since it hasn’t been done in 600 years,” Avelar said. “It’s a very humbling thing to say that someone else is more capable. It’s a very good example to set.”
Zoe Roth, a senior majoring in narrative studies, also said she was glad the pope felt like he could make the decision to resign.
“I’m glad he’s resigning if he does not feel like he is good enough health to perform his duties,” Roth said. “In this day and age, he’s under a lot of scrutiny, and it’s important that he can do his job well.”
Since the announcement of the pope’s resignation, the selection process for his successor has been under way. Some students welcome the possibility of the Cardinals electing a non-European pope for the first time.
“I really like how they’re opening it up now,” Avelar said. “I would prefer someone outside of Europe, just to see what they can bring to the table. Based on their experience outside of Europe, whether it’s from Africa or from here, they can bring a more global perspective.”
Juarez said that election of a pope from an area where Catholicism is still growing, such as Latin America, would be beneficial for the church.
“The Catholic Church is a very large institution and, even though it is relatively uniform because of the structure of the church, we have different ways of how we live our religion in our daily lives,” Juarez said.  “[The election of a Latin American Pope] will show a willingness of the Church to embrace who we are, which is a people of all nations.”
Even with the speculation around the search for a new pope, Roth noted that the upcoming change in pontiff, will not significantly impact on her day-to-day life.
“My religious experience has mostly been related to the church I go to and the community around that,” Roth said. “I don’t really think about what the pope is doing each day. He’s important, but my church and the community I grew up in are more important to me.”
Both Juarez and Alevar said that, going forward, the greatest challenge the church would face would be to remain true to their message in the face of a  constantly changing world.
“The greatest challenge is going to be how to remain faithful to the teachings of Jesus Christ while adapting to whatever the world throws at us,” Juarez said.
“he was unsure whether the pope stepped down for health reasons or because of the recent problems plaguing the church involving the child abuse scandals”
There’s nothing to be unsure about. People are so arrogant.

The home page to the new Trojan Family Archive, a collaboration between the USC Libraries and Alumni Association to digitize all Daily Trojan and El Rodeo editions online, officially launched today.
Family tree · USC Libraries and the Alumni Association officially launch the Trojan Family Archive online at alumni.usc.edu/archive. Readers can peruse El Rodeos from 1909 to 2005 and Daily Trojan issues from 1916 to 1988. — Screenshot by Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
The Daily Trojan, which has been published daily since 1912, currently has 11,978 issues online while El Rodeo, which has been published most years since 1898, has 83 volumes uploaded.
“We kind of wanted to put this front page on it, so that you didn’t feel like you had to go into the library to find it, and you wouldn’t have to go to the Alumni Association,” said Interim Associate Vice President of Alumni Relations Patrick Auerbach.
The project was first discussed in 2000, but only gained traction five or six years ago, according to the USC Archivist and Manuscript Librarian Claude Zachary. Zachary said the process of digitization was done off campus with micro-film copies of the Daily Trojan and El Rodeo. This initiative has so far cost around $150,000 and was funded by the USC Libraries and the Alumni Association, Zachary said.
The process of digitization began in 2012, and USC Libraries and the Alumni Association expect the process to be fully completed in the next month. Some of these texts are already freely available on the USC Libraries site.
Zachary said there were some formatting problems while digitizing material, which delayed the launch. There was an initial launch planned for last November and for Wednesday, Feb. 27.
Phase two of the project has plans to digitize the Trojan Family Magazine, and the Alumni Association and USC Libraries are in discussion regarding digitizing other publications. USC Commencement programs are also scheduled to be posted.
As for the student publications posted online, Zachary said digitization will help people who use the archives for genealogical purposes.
“It could help people to relive their memories and then it could get them really interested from the library side,” Zachary said. “It could also connect them to the Alumni Association and the broader university palate of offerings.”
Currently, the Alumni Association is focused on informing people of the site.
“What we’re doing now is we’re getting word out to alumni. We’re really proud of the project. It was something that’s really meaningful to us,” Auerbach said. “We assume that everybody has access to the Internet, so this online collection is a fantastic opportunity for people to have another way to connect with their alma mater.”
Director of Student Publications Mona Cravens said the digitization will not only have an impact on current students, but will impact all members of the Trojan Family.
“I’m extremely pleased that the library embarked on this project,” Cravens said. “Both publications are extremely important and each has recorded the day-to-day and year-by-year development of the university. A searchable archive will benefit all members in the Trojan Family.”
Joe Saltzman, a journalism professor in the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism and Daily Trojan editor-in-chief for the 1960-61 school year, praised the decision to keep a digital archive.
“The Daily Trojan has been the only chronicle of what happens at USC over the decades,” Saltzman said. “It’s great that people can go back year-to-year and see the history of the university through the prism of the Daily Trojan.”
Kate Mather, a former Daily Trojan editor-in-chief during the fall 2010 semester and current Los Angeles Times staff writer, said the Daily Trojan provides a unique perspective on the history of the university.
“The Daily Trojan has, everyday for more than 100 years, captured life on campus,” Mather said. “It is really wonderful that alumni, students and community members will have easy access to look at the issues and see the history of the university.”
Though old Daily Trojan articles can show the day-to-day life on campus, the El Rodeo archives provide an even wider scope of change at the university. Justin Chang, El Rodeo editor-in-chief for the 2003-04 school year an a senior film critic at Variety, said the digitization of the archives fulfills the purpose of the yearbook.
“I spent a lot of time leafing through old El Rodeos when I was editor — and the covers and embossing and feel of the pages are important — but going through the [physical] archives is tough and takes a while,” Chang said. “It’s great to think someone could leaf through the book because it gives the book a life of its own when people look back, which is the point of a yearbook in the first place.”
Zachary said the archives make the record of life on campus available to a larger audience.
“You can always watch a football game on TV, you can go to an event if you live near campus, see a faculty member or go to a cultural event like a student performance,” Zachary said, “But this Trojan Family Archive is a collaboration that really brings the Trojan family together.”

The July 20, 1984 issue is HILARIOUS!! With the Olympics in town, USC took the time to hijack the Daily Trojan and publish staff written articles. It’s like an admissions brochure.
Best Headline: “USC has diversity and strengths in academics: Schools of Medicine, Cinema-Television and Engineering highly ranked”

The Price School of Public Policy announced Thursday that it will partner with the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon near Alexandria, Va.
The Price School was selected for the partnership from dozens of university schools on the West Coast. The new relationship will provide Price students with research and programming opportunities, in addition to special access to library resources at both the university and Mount Vernon.
The library, which is currently under construction outside the estate, will officially open in September. The facility will house the original Washington papers and volumes and a research center in addition to hosting educational outreach and leadership training programs. The project was fully funded by private donations.
A donation from alumna Maribeth Borthwick and William Borthwick facilitated the creation of the partnership. Maribeth Borthwick is the vice regent of the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association, representing the state of California.
The first event resulting from the partnership will be the Borthwick Lecture Series on George Washington, an annual bicoastal lecture program featuring USC history professor Kevin Starr.
The Price School plans to expand the program to include research opportunities at Mount Vernon through additional funding in the future.

The National Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity officially banned the Sigma Phi Epsilon California Beta Chapter on Thursday afternoon after reports that the chapter violated the university’s sexual misconduct policies in its house on The Row.
The fraternity received an email from the Sigma Phi Epsilon National Board of Directors grand president Bert J. Harris III informing them of the decision. According to the president of Sigma Phi Epsilon California Beta Chapter Peter Hess, the chapter will be allowed to return to The Row after a minimum of five years.
Ousted · Fraternities are currently bidding on Sigma Phi Epsilon California Beta Chapter’s house, which is located on 700 West 28th Street. — Lauren Wong | Daily Trojan
According to the Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson, the suspension of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity went into effect Jan. 31.
“This action was taken based on a review of reports that the university’s sexual misconduct policies had been violated,” Jackson said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The university takes any report of sexual misconduct extremely seriously.”
The names of the students involved were not released because of privacy laws and both the university and the fraternity chapter refused to comment on the specific nature of the violation.
The Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards committee began the trial against SigEp in November after an individual reported that a crime occurred on Nov. 17 in one of the rooms of the fraternity.
Hess said that once notified by SJACS, the fraternity conducted an internal investigation. The investigation resulted in a member being expelled from the house.
“We felt like the member was withholding information,” Hess said. “We also expelled the member to show SJACS that we were not trying to hide anything. But they didn’t see it that way.”
Hess believes the alleged incident is not a reflection on the fraternity.
“What occurred in the room was an isolated incident,” Hess said. “It was the fault of the person in the room and not the chapter as a whole.”
The trial against the fraternity has been ongoing since November and the final decision from SJACS came on Thursday. Because the Cal Beta chapter is no longer officially recognized as a student organization, the members of the fraternity are unable to appeal the decision.
Hess informed members of the ban through email and in meetings on Thursday.
The house on The Row is owned by the national organization. Jackson said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that the fraternity letters on the front of the chapter house will be removed and it will function as a boarding house for the current residents until the end of the academic year.
Currently other fraternities on The Row are putting up bids for the house. The highest bidder will receive the rights to move into the house. After the ban, the new group of SigEp members will be able to reenter the house.
The decision to ban the fraternity will have effects on the other fraternities and sororities on The Row.
“The loss of USC and national recognition means no other recognized fraternities or sororities may socialize or interact with this former USC fraternity,” Jackson said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
I wonder if allegations of bad conduct, impropriety, and corruption will be raised and addressed at Conclave.  The one in Rome is just about to begin.
Administrators and fraternity officials don’t come to these decisions easily.  Despite support from the fraternity’s volunteers and staff, and campus officials, this chapter wasn’t willing or capable of providing a safe and positive experience for its members or guests.
Mr. Steele,
When will the property be sold?   Are you planning an auction?   Will you consider offers now?
We are prepared to make an all cash offer with a limited escrow period.
Thanks for your consideration!
It is always sad when a chapter closes but no one should be surprised in this case.  This chapter was given all the tools to succeed but refused to use them.  From reports and reputation this was a party club for rich frat boys who thought themselves above the rules.  They shouldn’t be allowed to wear the same letters or call themselves brothers of the fraternity men who are living the ritual and the cardinal virtues of the most valued partner in higher education today.  The chapter at SDSU dominates campus and is recognized by national for its excellence.  The chapter at UCI is growing, and is competitive in intramurals and musical theater.  UCR shows manpower and leadership growth.  Northridge and San Bernardino each excel in academics, philanthropy, and chapter operations.
How many Buchanan Cups has USC won?
Best “Animal House” on campus doesn’t count.
While the membership of the USC frat boys is suspended now, they can become fully-fledged members of Sigma Phi Epsilon after they graduate.   But to get there, the suspended members will need to abide by the regulations, which involves learning good behavior and not feeding cultural issues and bad actions that got them into hot water in the first place.   As recognized alumni they can enjoy all of the benefits of membership, including going to regional events; enrolling in courses on leadership and volunteerism; earning higher levels of membership status through donations to the Educational Foundation and use an affinity credit card; and the ability to purchase approved jewelry, sportswear and other co-branded fitness gear from licensed distributors.
You sound like one of those predators from Sig Ep national.   I guess you never got the reach around from the SC boys like the other schools.  Well, they paid the price for that.
Can’t wait for that credit card!
BTW: You have one the best porn names out there
When the chapter at George Washington University got its charter under the Balanced Man Program, all the brothers got free tickets to a Manilow concert!
Brilliant, that way the national predators could enjoy the show!
To someone a few posts above: no need to get your undies in a bundle about lower tier houses (the taxi…how clever!) leaving slanderous vitriol in this comment thread. While such Row drama makes for a captivating/hilarious read, I can assure you we give exactly zero craps about stirring the  pot further. Peace!
disgusting that you could ask that question. absolutely disgusting.
Trash house. I do not doubt the veracity of the sexual conduct reports one bit. I always warned my girl friends to avoid both Sig Ep and their tropically named next door neighbor. Creepy dudes.
Seems to be a lot of alleged “top tier” fraternities posting on these comment sections.  I am beginning to suspect you’re all actually from the taxi.
I’m a real top tier frat bro.   I can’t speak for the lower tier guys.
Glad to see another dirty frat removed from USC.
Let the hating begin!
Its FIJI not FIGI you BIRD
They are so insignificant on the row proper spelling doesn’t matter.   For my first three years, I thought it was a halfway house for gay teens
FIGI came back but they have sucked ever since
SMH. As an alum of USC and SPE it saddens me to hear my fraternity has been kicked off the row. When I was in school, “FIGI” was kicked out. I don’t know if they ever came back.
There is nothing about this article that should ever be considered “lazy”. This was not meant to be an opinion piece, as any insinuation that the punishment was in either way fair or unfair would jeopardize credibility for all involved. Everything stated in the article is fact, and anyone trying to discredit the journalism work here is simply bitter about their fraternity being shut down. I applaud Ms. Holman and the DT for their work.
The agenda here so transparent.   You should be ashamed!
@ John ’88
You should be ashamed of yourself. You insinuate that the victim should be partially to blame because of having too many drinks, which is appalling. Then when someone calls you on it you resort to name calling and racist remarks. 
I sincerely hope you don’t have a daughter or son. If you did I would hope you would instill better morals upon your son than what you currently possess. And if you had a daughter I would hope you would never blame her for the irresponsible actions of another. 
You don’t prevent rape by “relieving the pressure.” You want to know how we can help prevent rape? We teach our sons the following:
1. Don’t rape
Reading all of the comments on this article is making me embarrassed to go to school here. I thought going to USC required some semblance of intelligence and awareness, but apparently I’m wrong, because it seems like everyone who goes here is more concerned about maintaining the stellar reputations of their “top-tier” frats rather than punishing a crime, or at the very least waiting for further investigation before jumping to conclusions about whether or not sexual assault occurred.
The investigation is over and they were found guilty by the University.
An individual (not the fraternity in question as a whole) was found guilty of “sexual misconduct”, not assault.
Feel free to continue with your slander…
“The trial against the fraternity has been ongoing since November and the final decision from SJACS came on Thursday. Because the Cal Beta chapter is no longer officially recognized as a student organization, the members of the fraternity are unable to appeal the decision”
Leroy, maybe you should read the article before offering foolish comments.
Are you really arguing that the entire fraternity in question is guilty of sexual assault?
I dont care what the article (which isn’t entirely accurate) states.
That is absurd and you have yet to address my point that the word assault is not mentioned once, other than by ‘Dissapointed’s post and your implications.

@Disappointed
Believe me, I know how you feel.  Don’t be too discouraged though – there are those of us here who have our priorities in check.  We’re just not as noisy.
We aren’t talking about a top tier house here.   At best Sig Ep is middle lower tier.  Girls will need to go elsewhere for the free drinks and passing out.  I’m sure there are 10 more frat houses that will learn nothing from this and will simply repeat…
The English were still goat herders who were busy picking their noses when Indians were making headways in complex math, astronomy, and medicine asshole. Go find a job instead of trolling a student newspaper.
John ’88 is absolutely right about raw sewage running down the streets and that gang rape has gotten all sorts of international press coverage.   I guess all that ancient math, astronomy and medicine didn’t create a modern public sewage system.    Even the Romans had that worked out centuries ago.  Oh but you perfected the Slurpee since then…
My god!  Do you boys ever quit with the fake girl accounts and self-promotion?  Goodbye and good-riddance to your worthless organization.   They should have closed the entire row down years ago to protect women from the “rape culture”!
It sucks for Sig Ep, but lots of other fraternities need the space.  It used to be our (KA’s) house. It sounds like their alumni are just going to cash out and sell the house to the highest bidder.  So, how much is that going to be?  Anyone have an idea based on other houses that have been sold? Also do we call their nationals or their local alumni?
Dear Kappa Alpha,
We are not “cashing out”.  And we are not giving the house to the “highest bidder”.  But based on the trashy reporting by this DT writer I can see why you are misinformed.  Sig Ep got the shaft big time from USC, but we will be back bigger and better than ever.

Frank and/or Garry,
It seems your problem is with your own organization rather than USC.  Sig Ep shut down the chapter.  The university did not, rather only “suspending” it — according to this news article. 
This is what Frank says: “The University did not rescind recognition of the organization.”
This is what Garry says: “Sig Ep got the shaft big time from USC.”
If there’s more to the story, you might get in contact with the newspaper.  Or have your organization announce it.
It could be that the allegation is overblown and there was a lack of due process on both the institutional and national fraternity sides of this.  There would seem to be a pattern with Vermont, etc.
What ridiculous lies. Sig Ep Cal Beta “got the shaft” big time from Sig Ep Nationals long before USC.
You can tell by how Frank and Garry’s stories dont match up and they are vehemently attempting to cover up their motivation for leasing/selling the house as something other than financial…
Obviously this is a troubled property outside of the fraternity’s sexual issues.  Without cash flow, I’m seeing a potential short sale opportunity down the road.
I’m a real estate broker specializing in multifamily properties.   I have not been inside the property but I can do a quick analysis of the property value from my sources.   According to public records, the building and land are worth about $710,000 for tax purposes.   However, they aren’t making any more land on 28th so you will need come up with a fair market offer on the property.   Given the demand for similar lower tier properties, somewhere around $1.25m to $1.5m would be a reasonable offer.   This range assumes the interior is poor condition as most frats are and you would need to spend significant cash to make the place liveable for an upper tier frat like Pike to move-in.
Let me add that at 6.5% on $1.5m (high but this is non-recourse rate) your payment would be $13k/month on a 15 year fixed.  I would factor in another $3k a month for property taxes and other similar expenses.   I know people are going to argue the rate but I have experience in this area and no lender is going to give your 3.3% on a frat.  Too much risk!
Commercial Broker,
Even your sober evaluation of the numbers might be optimistic.  The potential purchaser at your numbers would need to be, I think, an already recognized USC greek letter organization.  Those organization would condition the contract to purchase on the sale or lease of their current property.  Given the economy, that could be too difficult in such a tight time frame in order to put rent-paying tenants in the former Sig Ep house before August 2013.  Nevermind that most students have already signed contracts.  So the purchaser is now looking taking possession now but not being able to generate revenue until late 2014.
You are correct that conventional financing will be difficult.  If the revenue stream can be shut down by something as a tenuous as on-campus disciplinary board, then the lenders will require assurances or charge high rates for the insecurity.
What is missing from the article and your research is — who owns the property and under what conditions?
hahahahahahaha…..
I wonder how successful you are as a broker.
you gotta do more research on this.
I bet you people will pay double of your number to live in that house.
$13k sounds like a funny joke
It’s $16k (not $13k) a month to service the loan, taxes and insurance based on $1.5mil mortgage.  You are going to need at least 20% down plus sufficient capital for improvements needed for a top tier frat.   You would need $500k cash on hand for a lender to even speak to you.  $16k is not rent but a purchase if you understand the difference.   However, I will educate you on how things work if you and your lower tier bros want to rent it after I buy it.  Mortgages are paid on a 12 months basis while most fraternities pay rent on an 8 or 9 month basis.  Factoring a 8 month rent cycle to pay a 12 month debit service the rent would be more like a minimum of $24k/month.  That doesn’t include what I am going to make as a profit on my investment from you fools either.  
Stay in school and lay off the pipe…
why do you think they are selling the house………..
Upper tier frat like pike?  lol
Commercial Broker or.. Pike?
hahahahahahaha
Not to mention the B-Chugging story concerning Kappa Alpha fraternity at the University of Tennessee.
Serena,
FYI –  sexual assault isn’t just about female victims.  Men are preyed on too, and they face significant social barriers  to reporting campus assaults, particularly when the alleged perps are fraternity men.  Some do report.  For example – Sig Ep at SMU.  In that case, the national fraternity and administration has so far not taken any publicly known action.
Not to mention the B-Chugging story concerning Kappa Alpha fraternity at the University of Tennessee.
You “male rights advocates” need to take into consideration that it is highly unlikely that a woman would lie about getting raped just to spite some guy… a woman would not willingly debase herself and publicly admit to being sexually violated because of the immense social repercussions it comes with. No wonder so many cases of rape go unreported, especially on college campuses which are hives of gossip and social hierarchy- women are afraid of tarnishing their reputations. It’s about time misogynistic rape-culture-advocating institutions get what’s coming to them.
No wonder this fraternity got closed down.   Here they are attacking the girl they assaulted using fake female postings.  Truly sick and disgusting behavior!
Your frat will always be the bottom feeders of the row and no one will miss you.   I hope your national gives the house to Pike who will be a much better part of the row than you ever were.
I have banged plenty of ugly girls and felt bad about it the next day.  The last thing I would do is report to the University that some DG raped me.
There were false accusations, lack of evidence, and discrimination against the males involved because of the “frat” stereotype. 
The sig ep involved is actually innocent and his only mistake was bringing outsiders in. I don’t want to throw any other fraternity under the bus but how does one get away with a viral email that rates girls based on race and ethnicity or the sex pictures on top of WPH. Two “sexual misconducts” in one semester yet still exist. Almost torturing a pledge in a house and roofing drinks. 
Yet, some GDI females invade private property after being told to leave the room during the night of the incident and leads a non-usc student on only to report it. 
Female friend,
THATS NOT JUSTICE
I hope they sue the false accuser
I heard from a SigEp that the one being accused of the assault wasn’t even someone in the house, but a member’s friend? So why is SigEp losing their charter?
Lily,
If true, Sig Ep is the real victim!
Shame on all of you who choose to comment on whether or not the “punishment fits the crime,” instead of having some sympathy and respect for the true victim in this.  It was likely that a girl was sexually assaulted, and you choose to complain about the boys “not getting a break?”  I’m sad for those members who were not involved, but let’s keep some perspective here.  
John ’88 – you are either willfully ignorant of the world around you or a function of the misogyny that you claim does not exist.  “Rape culture” is a prevalent and serious issue in our society.  Perhaps instead of blaming men’s lack of control on whether they’d “taken care of themselves beforehand,” we should encourage young men to take actual responsibility for themselves and treat women as actual human beings, instead of blaming their actions on their erections.  I suggest you Google “rape apologist.” 
I am a current USC student who has nothing against the individuals in this  fraternity who were not involved with this situation.  However, I also believe that, in deciding to accept this individual as a member of their “brotherhood,” they must also consider who they are choosing to represent them.  I sincerely hope that USC addresses these issues on a larger scale instead of sweeping it under the rug without comment.
Shame on you for assuming a girl was sexually assaulted.   It could have been another guy that was assaulted as well.   Unlikely but still possible.
“Sad they had close up shop because some girl had a few too many drinks and a member couldn’t keep his pants zipped. They should have had the members “take care of themselves” before any event to keep the safe for the girls.”
Looks like someone is a hypocrite. To be clear: it does not matter if it was a girl or a guy who was assaulted – the message is still the same.  I think it’s sad that stuff like this still happens at a university that has made such great strides in its academic reputation.  Fellow classmates: We are all here at USC because the university felt that we had intellectual and personal merit.  Let’s respect each other accordingly. Please.
Still another house needs to be razed to the ground and a park built.   The entire row should be a park!
It is truly sad when one bad apple spoils the entire basket.   If a rape occurred (I assume this to be true),  USC has no business investigating it.   This is a matter for real law enforcement like LAPD.   Get the samples, investigate the scene and interview the parties.   If a crime is committed, people need to go to jail.   Unless the fraternity sponsored a “Sexual Misconduct” themed party or somehow directly encouraged the crime, USC has no business closing them down.   It is clear Sig Ep is a lower tier frat with no clout with either SC or their national organization.   It was easier for the national frat to close down a lower tier frat like this one and start over later.  They want to come back some day so this was a business decision and not one that appears to be based on a criminal complaint because their is no mention of any charges being filed against any party.
So give the rest of the guys in the house a break!  They committed no crime other than being part of a lower tier frat.
USC goes to very great lengths to keep unseemly statistics out of public record.  They’re scapegoating the student organization to make it look like justice has been served.  Would bet money no charges are filed against assailants.
Oh, here comes the conspiracy theory that USC kept LAPD out of the rape loop

So one member turned out to be an indecent human being, so ALL the members have been punished? Hallelujah, justice has been served! With this reasoning, in the US, with the highest prison population, all the citizens should be locked up!
It is a shame that 1 member can bring down an entire fraternity of men who did nothing wrong. The punishment does not fit the alleged crime.
Also what  is “sexual misconduct”? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? If it’s sexual assault then IT SHOULD BE CALLED SEXUAL ASSAULT. How can these issues be addressed properly if they can’t even be identified and named properly? Misconduct can mean anything – from not behaving nicely in class or awkwardly hitting on a coworker or mooning someone in public. Sexual ASSAULT is DIFFERENT and it needs to be ADDRESSED BY THE UNIVERSITY.
A fraternity was banned from The Row at USC due to “sexual misconduct.” No one is reporting on the details of what what his actually entails!!!!! Either way, this is disgusting and ridiculous and I am glad SOMEONE is finally serving up some real penalties for misconduct rather than giving frats a symbolic slap on the wrist and then returning to business as usual. Granted, this penalty should have come from USC itself rather than the national chapter. USC should stand up for it’s OWN students.
I guess I am missing something here…SAE almost kills a kid during hazing (2010) And Lamda chi members are accused of sexual assault in 2010 (same as above) yet nothing happened to either of those houses? Meanwhile an accusation is leading sig ep to get kicked off the row? This is sloppy journalism missing key points of the argument or complete Hypocrasy.
Comparing apples and oranges.  “This fraternity will be different.”
I’m sorry it has come to this.  Sig Ep was once a respected middle-lower tier house on the row.   Sad they had close up shop because some girl had a few too many drinks and a member couldn’t keep his pants zipped.   They should have had the members “take care of themselves” before any event to keep the safe for the girls.
John ’88,
I am personally insulted that you would reduce the victim as a girl who “had a few too many drinks” and the perpetrator as a member who “couldn’t keep his pants zipped.” You do not know what the details of the incident were, and you definitely do not have a right to insinuate blame on the victim. Although I am sure that most members of this fraternity are fine, ambitious gentlemen, and most don’t deserve this punishment, the extreme action that the national board took was a fantastic step towards abolishing the horrific blasé and “rape cultured” attitude that people like you have towards sexual assault – especially at the college level. Let’s not waste time thinking about what the victim should have done differently, let’s think about how to prevent (potential) perpetrators from causing harm.
Current USC Student
@Made up name:
I happen to be very familiar with the Row culture but I know nothing about this “rape culture” you mention.  This is another made up term to scare people like you and it works.
I certainly didn’t call her a hussy so I am not sure why you are so offended.  Maybe everything offends you?
We never had problems like this in the mid-eighties.  Back in our day, we relieved the pressure before the big party.   The whole house did this, individually.   As a result of this practice, we never had anything close to sexual assault reported in my four years.
Maybe the University needs a seminar on this practice in addition to all the others?
@John ’88:
First of all, Anupama is a real name. You suck for being a racist butthole.
Second of all, lol to using the word “hussy.” Did you graduate in Shakespearian time?
Third of all, expand on your definition of “relieving the pressure” before parties. I’m very curious as to what you were implying.
Thanks!
It’s sad what qualifies as names these days.  Parents should be ashamed.
Why don’t we meet up and I’ll show you.
OKAY, John ’88. Meet me outside the DPS building. Tomorrow. 8am.
Sorry Angie, I don’t do DP.
@John ’88,
First, I strongly recommend you do your research before you throw out comments about cultures of which you have no knowledge. Anupama comes directly from the language Sanskrit and means “incomparable.” Sanskrit is many hundred—if not a thousand—years older than English, the language from which your name comes.
Second, rape culture isn’t something that scares people. It is as real as what you call the “Row Culture,” and I hope you will read this article to learn more about it. I am not trying to equate the two, but instead point out that rape culture has intellectual roots and isn’t just a couple of words that a person threw together on a Saturday night. http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/07/rape-culture-libby-brooks
Sincerely,
Yes my name is real.
Thank your lucky stars the England halfway civilized your people and brought them out of the Stone age.   India is still the land where raw sewage flows in the streets and women get gang raped on buses.  That’s some culture…
Hi again, John ’88
I am actually extremely amused by your ignorance and haste in responding to people. I think you need to slow down, research what it is you are making deplorable comments on, and then maybe we can discuss.
Rape culture is the way in which unwanted sexual advances is rationalized in our society. This happens through our colloquialisms, the way we think about the victim (whether male or female) as a person who “asked for it,” and the way the assaulter is seen as somebody who was tempted and “couldn’t help it.”
Please enlighten me on what “row culture” exactly implies.
Secondly, like Angie, I am utterly baffled by this “practice” of relieving the pressure that you mention. It seems laughable to expect something like that to be a solution to the issue at hand. 
– Anupama (Indeed my real name)
Should someone who graduated college in ’88 really be commenting on a thread about a fraternity at his alma mater, fighting with a college student, and suggesting that the solution to rape is well-timed masturbation?
It’s good to see that the tendency for lazy journalism starts early.   I would guess that the university does not have a policy on “sexual misconduct” to violate, however there might be one on “sexual conduct.”  I don’t believe that SJACS had a trial, but they did conduct an investigation and render a decision.  The University issued it’s decision and the National Fraternity chose to remove the chapter’s charter.  The University did not rescind recognition of the organization.  Finally, the property is not going to the “highest bidder.”

Frank,
Where do we submit our bids for the fall for the entire property?  As you likely already know, Pike is the top house at SC and would make a excellent tenant for your property.  We have plenty of cash and over a 150 active members.   We have never been accused of sexual misconduct or any similar offense.   Looking forward to making an agreement in the near future!
Frank,
Obviously you did not read ariticle correctly. The journalist states in the lead sentence that the National Sigma PHI Epilson Frat made the decision to ban the chapter. Also, you should not assume USC policies. So before you come here to criticize hard working journalist, you should get your facts straight.

I can understand you being defensive about your daughter’s writing.  That doesn’t change the fact that it’s poorly written, at least in regard to accuracy.  Take a second and read through his titles and you might notice that he is the alumni president of the Fraternity in discussion.  He’s not assuming anything, in regard to either university policies or the preceding of the ban, given that he would actually be the most informed of any party in the situation.
J,
I would think the president of Sigma Phi Epsilon California Beta Chapter Peter Hess whom was “quoted” in the article would be closer to the situation than an Alumni volunteer. If the information Peter gave was incorrect then Frank and him should have a conversation to straighten out the facts.
Papa Holman

Didn’t know the helicopter blades reach all the way from Chicago…
Still poorly written and researched.   Let her defend her own lazy reporting Pops!
I think what Frank was pointing out–and that you seemed to miss–was that the article is clearly misquoting the situation and what the President of the Fraternity said.
May I suggest you join this new website called 4chan?
Frank,
I’ve read the DT and have known a lot of writers within the DT for sometime. Just because you’re peeved about your fraternity getting kicked off the Row for five years doesn’t give you license to misconstrue the facts and cop it all to “lazy journalism”, which – mind you – you won’t find at the Daily Trojan. All the facts made in this article are attributed to University officials or Sig Ep leadership, which is far more than anything you cared to post.
Ms. C.
Article sucks and you know it.   Poorly written at best.   
I’m not a Sig Ep and they are bottom tier house at best.
Show me ONE part of the article that was factually inaccurate. If you have a beef with anything Jackson, Hess or Sig Ep’s national organization told the DT that’s one thing, but to attack the writer is another entirely.
Please direct me to the University’s Sexual Misconduct Policies.  Explain how I violate a misconduct policy.   How is a fraternity banned and who can do this?  Fraternities actually lose their Charter or it is suspended by the national fraternity.  There is no such thing as being banned.  Universities remove or suspend recognition.
Whoops. I meant to say, “money and prestige should NOT be able to buy immunity.”
Finally. Some accountability on the row. Obviously, this is the exception to the norm, but when I was at SC, similar incidents were swept under the rug. Money and prestige should be able to buy immunity.

The Trojans can’t afford a letdown now. On senior day and USC’s final home game this season, the Trojans take on Arizona State in a Saturday matinee that will be crucial for USC’s seeding in the upcoming conference tournament.
The Trojans are coming off an upset win over No. 11 Arizona on Wednesday. Now, USC (13-15, 8-7 Pac-12) is looking to avenge its heartbreaking 98-93 overtime loss in January to the Sun Devils (20-9, 9-7).
Return to form? · Senior forward Eric Wise (above) led the Trojans with 22 points on efficient nine-of-12 shooting in USC’s 89-78 upset victory against the No. 11 Arizona Wildcats on Wednesday. It was the fifth loss of the season for Arizona, the top-ranked team in the Pac-12. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Saturday will be the final game at the Galen Center for senior forwards Eric Wise, Aaron Fuller and Renaldo Woolridge, as well as center James Blasczyk and point guard Jio Fontan, who is the Trojans’ longest-tenured player in his third season at USC.
“It’s bittersweet,” Fontan said. “I know I’m going into a bright future going forward with everything I learned here at this school on and off the court but, at the same time, it’s going to be sad knowing that I’m not going to be playing here again.”
In a 22-point showing against the Wildcats on Wednesday, Wise looks to have finally found his shot after struggling all February from the floor. He shot nine-of-12 against Arizona and leads the Trojans with 12.3 points a game. Junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell shot five-of-eight from the floor in the win and leads USC over the last five games with 15.6 points per contest.
Fontan, meanwhile, gives his teammates all the credit for helping in his role as the floor leader, playing more than 33 minutes a game.
“My teammates make it all easier,” Fontan said. “They definitely go out there and listen to what I have to say, and make the adjustments I want to make.”
The key to USC’s win over Arizona was starting strong, rather than letting the Wildcats blow them out of the water from the get-go.
“Any game, you need to get off to a good start and establish yourself,” USC interim head coach Bob Cantu said. “Especially at home.”
In true Cantu fashion, Saturday’s matchup should be a lightning-fast race up and down the court for both sides. The Trojans are coming out of an 89-point performance, their second-highest total of the season. The first? That overtime loss at Arizona State on Jan. 24.
The most challenging assignment of the night lies with Fontan, who will be tasked with guarding the Sun Devils’ talented freshman point guard, Jahii Carson. Carson is fourth in the Pac-12 with 17.7 points per game, and third with 5.1 assists per outing. He had 21 points and eight assists in the team’s first meeting.
The Trojan offense fired on nearly every cylinder on Wednesday except for junior forward Dewayne Dedmon, who had four fouls in his first seven minutes. Dedmon finished with three blocks in just 10 minutes, but will be looking for a more consistent game inside against Arizona State center Jordan Bachynski, whose 3.7 blocks per game make him one of just two players ahead of Dedmon (2.1) for the conference lead. Junior center Omar Oraby will be looking to avoid foul trouble too, after fouling out on Wednesday.
After Saturday, the Trojans head north to face Washington and Washington State to close out the regular season.

Following a bitter conference loss against Cal, the USC women’s tennis team will look to return to its winning ways on Friday against San Diego.
The loss dropped USC’s record on the year to 8-2 overall, although it should be noted that both losses occurred at the hands of top-10 teams.
With a win Friday, the Women of Troy can begin their climb back into the top-10 national rankings. They started the season ranked No. 4 in the nation, before a loss at the ITA National Team Indoor championships in Virginia to now top-ranked North Carolina dropped them to No. 7. Following the Cal loss, the Women of Troy dropped four more spots to No. 11 in the nation, putting them on the outside of the top 10 for the first time all year.
Individually, USC’s rankings fell as well. Last week, sophomore Sabrina Santamaria impressed the entire nation, earning the top ranking in both singles and doubles play (alongside her partner, junior Kaitlyn Christian). Following the loss to the Golden Bears, she dropped to No. 3 overall in singles play, while retaining the top spot in doubles play. Senior Danielle Lao, one of the most consistent players in the nation, remains in the top 10, dropping a few spots to find herself at No. 7. Rounding out the top 30 in the rankings is sophomore Zoë Scandalis, who currently stands at No. 26.
The game against the San Diego Toreros should serve as a tune-up before a rivalry matchup against No. 3-ranked UCLA in Westwood next Friday. The Toreros enter the matchup at 3-2 overall and have no players ranked nationally in singles or doubles. The two teams met last year under similar circumstances, with USC winning 6-1 to improve the series record against San Diego to 25-3 all-time.
Following the game on Friday against the Bruins, the Women of Troy enter a soft spot in their schedule. USC will play five games in a row against unranked teams, including the first three at Marks Stadium, where the Trojans have yet to lose all year. Unfortunately, those five games are played in the span of 12 days — a daunting task regardless of the opponents. Compounding that difficulty, there are two back-to-back games in that stretch, meaning the Women of Troy’s endurance will certainly be tested.
The game Friday will take place at 1:30 p.m. in San Diego (the Women of Troy are 2-1 on the road this year). The squad will have some rest before competing against the Bruins on March 8.

It’s safe to say the USC men’s volleyball team has underwhelmed at the start of the 2013 season, as the group’s inexperience, combined with the loss of two key players, has dropped the Trojans to 3-8 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation competition.
Running out of time · The Trojans started 6-5 last season but ended up making a run to the national championship game. This season, USC will have to dig itself out of an even bigger hole to make the playoffs. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
As such, the team’s upcoming four-game road trip will be crucial toward determining how much the team must do to match the success of the 2012 squad.
After a grueling homestand that saw them drop three straight matches following an opening win against Cal Baptist, the Trojans leave the Galen Center for Northern California, where they will take on Pacific and Stanford this weekend in an attempt to salvage their season.
“We had four matches in seven days, which we’ve never done since I’ve been on any staff here,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “It was taxing physically and mentally, as guys were returning to the lineup, and it was a tough time in the season to have that stretch.”
The win against Cal Baptist put the Trojans at 3-5 and offered some hope heading into matches against some of the tougher opponents in the conference. The momentum failed to generate wins, however, as USC dropped consecutive decisions to BYU, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara by margins of 3-1, 3-0 and 3-1, respectively.
“We’re starting to improve and get comfortable with the guys on the court,” Ferguson said. “Against Cal Baptist, our team did a nice job weathering the storm and controlling their serve. The next few matches, you saw us get off to slow starts in the first set. We’ve been playing very well in the third and fourth sets but, for whatever reason, it doesn’t seem to work.”
Ferguson also noted that the final three matches of the homestand were all quite similar in that the final score did not exactly represent how well the team played. Though the Trojans were outplayed both offensively and defensively throughout the majority of those matches, it was often the product of small stretches of poor play that negated longer periods of consistently strong production. Ferguson noted that the extended period of rest was critically beneficial to the team.
“The time off was huge,” Ferguson said. “The guys need it and, hopefully, it’s enough time. For the most part, we’re in a fairly good cycle for practicing and days off and playing. We saw this coming long before the season started, so we think we have a pretty good plan in place.”
Though Pacific and Stanford represent tough challenges for the Trojans, the team has the added benefit of having seen both of these opponents this season, including in a 3-0 sweep of the Cardinal at home on Jan. 18.
“We’re mired near the bottom of the league right now and Pacific’s right near us,” Ferguson said. “A win against them would be huge because we need to start climbing and beating teams near and ahead of us. We need to have a solid showing against them to stay in the hunt for the playoffs.”
Following the two tilts in the Bay Area, the Trojans will trek to Honolulu, where they will face Hawai’i twice the following weekend to conclude their last four-game road trip of the season.
Ferguson is a real good excuse maker. Starting to improve with last three pathetic losses this far into the season.
Something amiss after the two sweeps of then #1 & #2 Irvine (on the road) and Stanford. Two key players
lost assume were Ciarelli and Shandrick from last year which was not listed in your article after stated in 1st
paragraph. Your reporting needs to be improved along with the volleyball team. A good pertinent question to
have asked the Coach was why no outstanding players on the front line have been recruited in the past four
years.

If nothing else, USC head coach Lane Kiffin provides for some solid sound bites. He didn’t disappoint on Wednesday.
Quoted in an ESPN L.A. article, Kiffin discussed quarterback Matt Barkley’s draft status. Barkley took a tumble down the draft boards this season, and it’s possible he falls out of the first round. Kiffin said Barkley is a great player and emphasized it with the following:
“If Matt Barkley had the defense that Matt Leinart and Carson Palmer had, Matt Barkley would have won the Heisman Trophy just like they did,” Kiffin said. “He would have had the winning records they had.”
Here we go again.
Now, don’t get me wrong. The Trojans’ defense was not very good this season. It took a lot of blame for the team’s 7-6 record and deservedly so. Giving up 62 points to Oregon? Not going to get it done. Ever. Unless you’re West Virginia playing against Baylor.
Players who were expected to play big roles didn’t come through on defense. And Lane’s dad ended up resigning because of it. A team that gives up 24.3 points per game is not going to win many national titles, even if the team was ranked No. 1 in nearly all the preseason polls. And as far as Heismans are concerned? They always go to teams that win around 10 games. That’s why Marqise Lee didn’t get an invite to New York this year. Lane is not wrong in his analysis.
But it sure doesn’t mean it was the right thing to say.
In making the aforementioned comments, Kiffin is once again shedding blame for a disastrous season. For someone who recently accepted responsibility for the entire season in another ESPN interview, this seems like a giant step backwards The defense wasn’t great, but the offense wasn’t setting the world on fire, either.
Plays were predictable. There were too many bubble screens. They didn’t run the ball enough. First and second down were gimmes which led to third and long frequently. They turned the ball over. The list goes on and on.
Matt Barkley’s numbers suffered because of playcalling and a lack of efficiency from the offensive coordinator. Who was that again? Ah, yes. The head coach himself.
Kiffin is a good offensive coordinator in general. But the offense he led didn’t really hold up its end of the bargain. That’s fine. Teams don’t always play the way we expect them to. But to not accept that blame and to put it on the defense? That seems irresponsible.
Oh, and about that defense: As head coach, Kiffin has to take some responsibility too. A coach oversees the entire operation: He can’t just pick and choose what he wants to take credit for. And in calling out his defense from this past season, he’s burning bridges. There are at least seven starters returning from the 2012 squad. How are they going to feel about supposedly being the reason Barkley is falling down draft boards? Probably not the best way to handle the situation, all things considered.
I support Barkley. I always have and always will. I love what he’s done for this university, especially in the wake of crippling sanctions. I think he has the chance to be an NFL starter. But he had a tough 2012 season. It’s a fact. There’s no way around it. Kiffin needs to acknowledge it. It’s OK if Barkley struggled. Players struggle all the time.
But to blame your defense for being the reason he took such a tumble? It’s in poor taste. Kiffin has a team to command in 2013 — a potentially excellent team at that. He cannot play favorites because he wants to see Barkley succeed. You win as a team and you certainly lose as a team. And he has to coach — he’s not Barkley’s public relations manager.

whatever scott, maybe you should pattern your writing style after someone with real integrity like jim murray instead of following in the small minded footsteps of scott wolf, is it about blog hits or did lane hurt your feelings too?

It’s the first true road test of the season this weekend for USC baseball, as the team heads up the 99 Freeway to visit the Fresno State Bulldogs in a three-game set.
Run production · The Trojans have scored at least four runs in each of their last three games dating back to Feb. 23 against Cal State Northridge. — Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (5-3) have already played three games away from Dedeaux Field, but those were quick trips to places like Fullerton and Northridge. As has been the case in recent years, USC will travel to one of the nation’s marquee programs for their first “roadie.” In 2011 it was to Rice and last year it was to North Carolina.
“It’s going to be a great atmosphere,” junior pitcher Bobby Wheatley said of Fresno’s Beiden Field. “We’re expecting a packed house and that’s exactly the kind of atmosphere you want to be playing in.”
Wheatley will take the ball for the Trojans on Friday night under the lights against the Bulldogs (1-6). Though their record is down, Fresno State is almost an identical team to the one that made a regional last year. The Bulldogs have seven returning starters among the nine regular batters, yet are hitting just .238 as a team with an on base percentage of .296.
The Bulldogs’ pitching staff is even more confounding. Last year’s ace, Tyler Linehan, is currently sitting at the far end of the bullpen with a 16.88 ERA in four appearances this year. Fresno State’s three weekend starters have a combined ERA of 2.45 over 36 2/3 innings. The problem has been their bullpen, which is responsible for 20 earned runs over just 15 1/3 innings. That’s an ERA of 11.74.
“They’ve been struggling, obviously,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “But their M.O. is that they get rolling right as March kicks in. So we can’t take them lightly.”
That might sound like generic coach speak, but the Bulldogs are a combined 21-10 in March the last two years, compared to 6-11 over the last two Februarys.
“They may have a down record now,” Wheatley said. “But their record doesn’t indicate how good they’re going to be.”
Unlike the Bulldogs, the Trojans have benefited from fairly solid work from their bullpen. Sophomore pitcher Nigel Nootbaar has shut out all opponents in his four appearances this year, as has freshman Sean Adler, who has yet to allow a hit in his college career.
“With the guys we have in the bullpen, I didn’t think I’d get this much opportunity early in the year,” Adler said. “But [Hubbs] and I have been on the same page in that as long as I’m throwing strikes, and as long as I’m hitting my spots, he’s gonna keep me in there.”
Hubbs stressed the importance of keeping the ball down in the strike zone against Fresno State hitters.
“They have a park that the ball jumps out of,” Hubbs said. “[But] it does play truer at night. So, fortunately, we’re playing two night games. Then Sunday, [the lone day game of the series] the ball usually travels. So we’ve got to keep the ball low.”
Wheatley did just that last Friday against Cal State Northridge. In his six strong innings, he allowed just three fly balls to the outfield and one extra base hit. He’ll try to do the same tonight in Fresno. First pitch on Friday and Saturday is at 6:35 p.m., with a Sunday matinee at 1 p.m.

The USC men’s tennis team (13-2) made quick work of the University of San Diego Toreros (6-3) on Thursday as they came away with a 6-1 victory in San Diego. The Trojans are now 5-1 away from Marks Stadium this season.
Straight-set victory · Junior Ray Sarmiento earned a point for the Trojans in their match against the Toreros with a 6-3, 6-3 win over San Diego’s Romain Kalaydjian. Sarmiento is the No. 14 singles player in the country. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan 
The Toreros, ranked No. 36 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, had a tough time against the lineup of the  No. 2-ranked Trojans. It was business as usual for USC, which was coming off a tough loss to UCLA last Friday, but recovered nicely by starting strong and securing the doubles point.
USC head coach Peter Smith switched up the doubles teams in anticipation of the match by pairing sophomore Roberto Quiroz and junior Emilio Gomez at the No. 2 doubles position and the newly formed tandem of freshman Max de Vroome and sophomore Eric Johnson at No. 3.
The two newly formed pairs responded to the changes by absolutely vanquishing their opponents. Cousins Gomez and Quiroz secured an 8-2 victory over the team of freshman Romain Kalaydjian and sophomore Victor Pugliese, and de Vroome and Johnson cruised to an 8-1 rout of sophomores Andrew Carlisle and Ciaran Fitzgerald.
“I love how we played in doubles today — the energy was really good,” Smith said.
The way the Trojans handled their opponents in singles play wasn’t much different.
Sophomore Jonny Wang, ranked No. 119 in the nation by the ITA, flew out of the gate at the No. 6 position and was the first to wrap up his match, defeating sophomore Andrew Carlisle in straight sets 6-0, 6-1. Afterward, Wang noted that despite being in picturesque San Diego with pleasant, warmer-than-usual weather, the Trojans “gave it [their] all and didn’t take anything for granted.”
In singles play, junior Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 14 in the nation, dispatched Toreros’ Kalaydjian in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3.
No. 5-position Max de Vroome returned to form after his tough outing last week against UCLA.
“The match went fine … [the] courts were really slow so I think everybody had some trouble with that,” de Vroome said. “I played OK. [I] started really strong [and] aggressive and didn’t give him much time to do anything.”
In the second set, de Vroome was serving for the match at 5-3, but lost the game because of some unforced errors. De Vroome would go on to recover and finish the match out for a 6-2, 7-5 victory.
Smith also noted that the courts played slower than expected.
“Every court’s different,” Smith said. “It’s a different challenge — the courts were really slow and it affected the way we played.”
When asked if the memories of last Friday’s match were erased completely, Smith had no doubts of his team’s mental toughness and ability to recover.
“Definitely,” Smith said. “The best thing to do is to just go out and compete again.”
Thursday’s match wasn’t all good news for the Trojans, however. Sophomore Yannick Hanfmann sat out all week with a knee injury that has plagued him from the start of the season.
“[Hanfmann]’s knee has really been bothering him ever since the UCLA match,” Smith said.
It would not be evident from the score, as Hanfmann won his match last week, including a bagel in the final set, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0. Regardless, Hanfmann is resting for the Trojans’ trip to San Diego.
The Trojans continue their mini-trip in La Jolla for the United States Tennis Association’s Pacific Coast Doubles tournament from Feb. 28 to Mar. 3. In an interesting wrinkle attributed to the Pacific Doubles championships’ open-registration policy, Sarmiento, who usually pairs with Hanfmann in doubles, will be partnering with volunteer assistant coach Peter Lucassen for the tournament. Lucassen, 24, hails from the Netherlands and was once ranked as high as No. 541 by the Association of Tennis Professionals before becoming inactive to take up his current post as volunteer assistant coach of the Trojans.
Lucassen and Sarmiento, as well as the newly formed doubles teams in Gomez and Quiroz and de Vroome and Johnson, will get additional time to adjust to one another as they face off against top-ranked representatives from Cal, Pepperdine, Stanford and UCLA.

Take a classic French dessert and mix in some unique, fragrant Filipino flavors — ube, pandan, turon — and the result is staggeringly delicious. It is this extraordinary combination of tastes and textures that the bakers of Crème Caramel, a Los Angeles-based dessert business, have mastered.
Sweet Tooth · Kristine de la Cruz (left) sets up shop at the Atwater Village Farmers Market. She sells homemade custards and bread pudding. — Elena Valeriote | Daily Trojan
Kristine de la Cruz, founder of Crème Caramel, has always been interested in baking, but practicality told her to stick to her stable job in marketing. Yet, every night, she found herself surrounded by recipes, thinking of how she might pursue her culinary passion.
Finally, just a little more than four years ago, she decided to make a bold move on her dream. So far, de la Cruz said, the decision has been worthwhile, especially when she sees how customers react to her products.
“When you work with baked goods, there’s this look of love on people’s face,” de la Cruz said.
The idea for her business started with a family recipe for a simple dish called crème caramel, a vanilla custard drenched in a caramel glaze.
Amid the proliferation of cupcake shops, such as the popular Sprinkles chain and other bakeries that have gained a A-list popularity, de la Cruz felt confident that the family recipe for crème caramel was good enough to break into the dessert business on its own.
“I wanted to focus on a niche,” de la Cruz said.
With this idea in mind, de la Cruz worked on perfecting her own version of crème caramel, a delectable French-Filipino hybrid with touches of a Filipino dessert called leche flan.
On Sundays, de la Cruz can be found at the Atwater Village Farmers Market. De la Cruz said that Crème Caramel makes a point to let customers sample their flavors.
“People don’t always know what crème caramel is, so we want them to give it a try. Chances are they’ll come back,” said de la Cruz.
De la Cruz is generous with her samples. She typically lets people sample four flavors, all doled out in little white paper cups. The first sample, the original crème caramel, is a perfect bite of creamy, perfectly thick vanilla custard with a touch of the delicately sweet caramel.
Following that, de la Cruz usually offers prospective customers a piece of her vanilla bread pudding with salted caramel sauce, which has similar flavors blended into chunks of soft, moist bread.
Next comes one of the more exotic flavors — an upside down ube pie. Though many customers initially shy away from this dish once they learn that ube is a type of purple yam, a pleasant experience awaits those who are willing to give it a try. Like an exotic, colorful cousin of a Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, the upside down ube pie has a buttery, crumbly crust that tops off a sweet interior. The treat was inspired by de la Cruz’s childhood.
“Ube is found in Filipino dishes. The flavors we use are inspired by what I grew up with,” de la Cruz said.
Though the business started with one simple custard, de la Cruz has expanded the menu to include dozens of flavors, featuring both custards and bread puddings. Vegan options are now available as well, so no one has to miss out.
“The original crème caramel sells out every week, but we’re surprised at how popular others, like the caramelized bread pudding, are,” de la Cruz said.
From Meyer lemon lavendar to turon (a Saba banana and jackfruit combo), de la Cruz has expertly paired dozens of rare flavors and is always looking to experiment with new ones.
Part of the process also involves working out the tricky baking issues, such as getting the marshmallows right for the upcoming Rocky Road flavor. But mistakes can sometimes inspire new ideas. Such was the case with the upside down ube pie, an idea that developed from having a difficult time getting the tops of certain custards to be perfectly smooth.
For de la Cruz, it’s important that ingredients used in Crème Caramel’s products come from local sources and small businesses. The bakers begin with the ingredients they find around them at the farmers market and then buy from nearby stores.
“We want to support our community,” de la Cruz said.
The workers at Crème Caramel hope that similar support will be shown when they open a storefront within the next year. Currently, desserts are made in a kitchen co-op and are sold online, at farmers markets and at The Park’s Finest restaurant.
Whether you’re craving salty or sweet (or even purple yam), Crème Caramel will certainly satisfy. Make a day of it and visit the Atwater Village Farmers Market — you won’t be disappointed.

There is something to be said for cinema’s ability to provide an escape. Sometimes you just need to wind down by watching something pointless, unrealistic and — at times — outrageous for a couple of hours.
Barely legal · Miller (Miles Teller, left) and Casey (Skylar Astin, right), return home from their respective colleges to celebrate their best friend Jeff ’s 21st birthday. Predictably, chaos ensues throughout the night. — Courtesy of John Johnson
 
Hollywood seems to have taken that idea to heart, ushering in another era of mindless entertainment ruled by crude humor about sex, bodily functions and crazy shenanigans.
The newest film to come out of this trend is 21 and Over, which, by its name alone, might carry low expectations for wit or empathy.
Nevertheless, the directorial debut of writer/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore manages to take a refreshing turn from what is quickly becoming standard Hollywood fare.
The movie centers on the 21st birthday of Jeff Chang (Justin Chon). His two best friends, Casey (Skylar Astin) and Miller (Miles Teller), plan on taking Jeff out to get drunk and laid on his birthday.
The problem is that the birthday boy has an early morning medical school interview the day after his birthday and his controlling father forbids him from doing anything that night other than getting a good night’s sleep. After Miller convinces Jeff to go out anyway for just one drink, things predictably spiral out of control.
Though there is a pervading sense of immaturity and lack of consequences throughout the film, the underlying message in it is an endearing one: Follow your dreams in life and trust your friends to help you achieve them. For those who come to enjoy the silly hijinks, though, don’t worry — the movie still has plenty of juvenile jokes and physical comedy moments (including a scene where a character graphically throws up from drinking, then proceeds to ride on an electric bull).
Panic and hilarity ensue after Jeff eventually passes out from too much alcohol and his two friends must take him home, except they have no idea where Jeff lives. The increasingly desperate best friends try and bring Jeff home, only to be confronted by the challenges of overly angry frat boys, a pack of revenge-seeking sorority girls and a rampaging bull.
You’ve seen this script before. But the layer of realism and touching emotion hidden away underneath the film’s bells and whistles is what makes it different. Casey and Miller come to the realization that living far away from one another because of college has made them drift apart.
The film also takes the time to explore some pretty dark details about Jeff’s life at school. Though the film centers on Jeff’s 21st birthday, it is the boys’ friendship that carries the film.
Another great thing about 21 and Over is the bawdy, but highly realistic, acting. Teller especially stands out with his cocky, abrasive and selfish portrayal of Miller, a character that you just love to hate because of his egotistical tendencies. Yet, Teller manages to bring heart to the role, inspiring sympathy toward him throughout the film.
Of course, any film centered on a 21st birthday is going to be filled with crude jokes, a couple of seemingly pointless nude scenes and excessive abuse of alcohol and drugs. And this film is no different. Still, much like The Hangover, 21 and Over  leaves you feeling energized and a bit disgusted. There’s something very satisfying about its ending. The crazy antics in the movie allow audiences to live vicariously through the characters, knowing that they themselves will never have to deal with the consequences of the night.
21 and Over is no great artistic film (though it does include some impressive cinematography and visually beautiful shots). But as far as “bromantic” comedies go, 21 and Over is definitely up to par with its predecessors and is a pleasant surprise for those going to the theater for mindless droll.

Last weekend was about as unsurprising at the box office as the majority of the Oscar winners at the ceremony this past weekend. Predictably, most people decided to watch the awards show at home than go out to the movies, as Identity Thief was able to return to its former No. 1 spot with just $14 million while both Snitch and Dark Skies failed to generate much interest.
This first weekend of March, though, brings some major releases, such as USC alumnus Bryan Singer’s fairy tale epic Jack the Giant Slayer, Relativity Media’s college comedy 21 and Over, the horror sequel The Last Exorcism Part II and the submarine drama Phantom.
For the past several years now, studios have treated March as a proto-summer month, releasing big-budget blockbusters and high-concept features that would normally debut during the summer. At times, this has worked out brilliantly, no more so than when The Hunger Games shattered every spring box office record in the books last year with a $155 million opening.
March 2012 was a huge month in general, with 21 Jump Street breaking out and The Lorax earning more than $200 million just last year.
However, this strategy doesn’t always work out. Last year also saw the release of John Carter, Walt Disney’s $250 million action epic that performed badly, getting back just a third of its gigantic budget. Unfortunately, it’s this movie, not The Hunger Games, that shares the most similarities to the big release of the weekend, Jack the Giant Slayer.
The Singer-directed film, starring Nicholas Hoult, Ewan McGregor and Stanley Tucci, was originally scheduled in June 2012 but was delayed a good nine months. Reports seemed to indicate that not only did early preview screenings flop, but that the majority of the action scenes had to be redone, ballooning the budget in the process.
Regardless of which scenes were re-shot, the film has taken on an over-produced look, with everything seeming to be excessively CGI. Though an ambitious feature like this was going to use CGI regardless, audiences recently just aren’t into features that look fake; there has to be some level of believability instead of just looking at an action reel for two hours.
The reviews have said that the film manages to strike a tone similar to 1980s fantasy films such as Excalibur and The Princess Bride, so it might gain a cult audience in the years to come. Still, there’s just not enough buzz to justify the estimated $195 million budget. Look for a mid-20s opening in the range of last year’s fantasy disappointment, Wrath of the Titans.
The fourth horror feature this year, The Last Exorcism Part II, is a direct continuation from the previous film. Nell, the main character played by Ashley Bell, returns to deal with the aftermath of her former possession and her struggle to fight the return of the devil.
Having a sequel called The Last Exorcism is silly enough in and of itself. The twist ending of the first film was so jarring and random that it derails the entire feature, ruining the “realistic” aspect of it completely. People are going to look at Part II and remember how much they hated the ending; it really doesn’t seem like the film will manage anything above $10 million.
From Relativity Media comes 21 and Over, a comedy that’s been bounced around for a few months and follows a student who goes out for a night on the town to celebrate his 21st birthday before his medical school exam. This is the directorial debut of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the writers of The Hangover, and it seems to be going for the same humor.
It’s being released a year after Project X, another college party film from people associated with The Hangover. What that film had that 21 and Over doesn’t was an effective viral campaign, anticipation over what exactly happens at this party and the found-footage aesthetic.
21 and Over seems downright old-school, more akin to the American Pie movies than the edgier Hangover features. A sub-$10 million opening is likely, but it might just be better to go find somebody celebrating their 21st and party with them.
Phantom is a Cold War-era submarine drama starring Ed Harris and David Duchovny from RCR Distribution, the film company behind those random direct-to-DVD/Netflix sequels such as Lake Placid 3, Stomp the Yard: Homecoming and Wild Things: Foursome. Despite this film seeming like a Syfy channel knockoff of K-19: The Widowmaker, it’s getting a wide release with over 2,000 theaters.
It’s a bad sign when you’ve never even heard of the company releasing the movie. This probably won’t even get one million, but at least it’ll likely be on Netflix by April if you really want to see Agent Mulder play a Russian.
Despite four movies coming out this weekend, it seems the box office really won’t get started until next week with the release of Oz: The Great and Powerful.
Or maybe Jack will end up being a giant success after all.

Newly elected South Korean President Park Geun-hye smiled for the cameras, waved to a cheering crowd and confidently asserted her ability to deal with North Korea, one of the most unpredictable dictatorships in the world.
As South Korea welcomed its first female president to office this week, the talking heads will surely be asking one of the most asked questions regarding the future of American politics: Should the United States be the next to welcome a woman to the White House as commander-in-chief?
The answer is inevitably yes. A woman in the Oval Office would not only add to the already impressive landmarks in equality that have come over the last few years, but would bolster and enhance the United States’ image abroad.
Furthermore, America’s preference for a female president in 2016 is strong; Fox News released a poll showing Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice leading the charge for the White House. Clinton, whom 55 percent of American’s think would do the best job, also garnered the largest response among strictly male voters — 47 percent. Support within the Democratic Party is even more overwhelming: The poll shows she would be a good president in the eyes of 83 percent of registered Democrats.
For the United States, these are encouraging signs. Legislative trends also bode well: A 2009 law extended the statute of limitations for filing lawsuits about equal pay for women in the workplace, a 2013 decision permitted women to serve in combat positions for the first time and just yesterday, Congress voted to keep the Violence Against Women Act.
The United States is poised to continue these historic developments with the election of a female to the presidency in 2016. When President Barack Obama’s second term comes to an end, he will leave behind a legacy of equality. And there would be no greater end to his presidency than the swearing in of the first female president in United States history.
Recent political battles that have taken a distinctly gendered air and have painted some members of Congress as waging a “war on women” also demonstrate the necessity of supporting the election of a woman to the United States’ top office. Though the most recent congressional elections resulted in a record 101 women in both houses, there was also plenty of misogynistic language and behavior, including insulting comments about rape from right-wing politicians, such as Todd Akin, and the censoring of Michigan Rep. Lisa Brown for say “vagina” on the state house floor.
The record number of women in Congress should clearly overshadow the latter incidents, but the mass media unfortunately determined that a record number of women in Congress doesn’t make as flashy a headline as another comment about rape and God.
Electing a woman to the presidency would make a bigger headline than either of those and would assuredly prevent the mischaracterization of the current crowd in Washington as waging a “war on women.” The election of Park in South Korea puts the number of female world leaders at 17. The United States should be one of them.

Harassment, humiliation, teasing, aggression. Cyberbullying, at a glance, seems identical to the traditional school-yard fights and classroom antics that have always existed. In the years since the advent of social media, however, cyberbullying has posed challenges that can be more difficult, in a way, than physical belittling.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
Though cyberbullying and its dangers have stepped from behind screens into the light long ago, it needs more attention and action from communities, schools and parents. Above all, it needs addressing by teens and young adults themselves — bullies and victims alike.
Though extremes, such as banning cyberbullying altogether — as a recent case in Maryland is seeking to do — are a stretch, stepping seriousness up a notch will do a world of good.
Cyberbullying — the use of instant messaging, email or social media to harass, threaten or intimidate — undoubtedly treads uncharted waters in today’s increasingly wired society. It poses unique challenges, from anonymous perpetrators to the ability to harass someone around-the-clock. A recent special report by CNN found that up to 25 percent of teenagers have experienced cyberbullying at some point. And, in the last 30 days, 10 percent of teens have been cyberbullied, according to a University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire survey of 15,000 middle and high school students.
What’s more is that it has arguably more impact on a child’s development and mental health than physical bullying. Another recent study by the International Criminal Justice Review reported that 28 percent of those cyberbullied — compared to 22 percent of those physically bullied and 26 percent who receive only bullying texts — were most likely to have considered suicide.
From the statistics alone, cyberbullying should definitely be considered a threat. The issue takes on a human face through stories such as those of the late Amanda Todd, whose high-profile suicide epitomizes the danger of cyberbullying when kids, emboldened by anonymity, go to vicious lengths to torment others. Cyberbullying can follow both victims and bullies from youth to adulthood, with onsets of depression, panic disorder, agoraphobia and thoughts of suicide. Bullies themselves are at risk of antisocial personality, according to CNN.
There’s a harder way to regulate bullying online because Internet activity does not have regulation or an organization that steps in when things get out of control.
There are some things that can help. Historically, there have been schools that refused to discipline students if the bullying didn’t strictly happen on school grounds. In the coming years, school authorities should intervene to prevent the escalation of cases.
Speaking out against cyberbullying, for oneself and for those around, is another way to help. WeStopHate.org, a nonprofit organization, does just that. Founded by Emily-Anne Rigal, a victim of bullying in elementary school, WeStopHate.org is just one group dedicated to helping people who have been bullied and providing a safe space to share stories.
Using the Internet for the better, scientists at MIT have been working on another solution: A system that will give bullying victims coping strategies, encourage bullies to think twice before typing and allow onlookers to defend victims. Just these solutions alone open the door for many more alternatives that could yield a better solution in the future.
There are still many out there that dismiss cyberbullying as an issue that can be easily “fixed” by just telling victims to quit Facebook or other social media sites. Shutting down the computer doesn’t make the problems go away, though. For victims who have had fake Facebook pages made by perpetrators, the issue creates not just rumors, but self-esteem-destroying lies told by faceless bullies. The cyber world extends into the real world, with real-world consequences. To seriously fix the issue, people have to change the mindset of victim-blaming and address cyberbullying for the monster it truly is. Getting both the bystanders and the bullies of the world, online and offline, to understand this will lead to change.

Solutions are being offered by the creators of “Submit the Documentary” they have an online resource center for educators, parents, and teens on this growing topic. They also just released a cyberbullying documentary that tells the stories first hand from the victims families that are affected by this epidemic. They also have free screenings and paid screenings for school to spread awareness on this cyberbullying topic.
Need help, My kids are active online user, and they are more exposed about this cyber bullies. How can i monitor what they’ve been doing online and who are they communicating.? any recommendation for this problem where i can keep updates about their online stats… Hope someone can help.
hi Janice, we do have the same problem, my kids spend most of their time online, they’ve been accepting lot of friends without even checking if they knew them. It also bothered me, so i found several solution on how can i monitor their updates while they are online, what are their postings and who are they communicating with. I have tried some online software like netnanny, but now i’ve been using pg guard. You can try it, it works well though.. Hope this helps..
You people are all too sensitive!
It’s sad to know that bullying has becoming into an online-form already. As parents, we should be vigilant with our kids’ activities especially that all these bullying issues are on the rise, leading them to becoming the victims or worse, the bullies themselves. I just read a blog that really stuck me to the core. A mother, writing about her own child’s safety and their heartbreaking experience.
Bystanders have a huge role to play in combatting cyberbullying. We created a documentary on cyberbullying called Submit the Documentary. If you think cyberbullying is an issue that needs to be addressed, check out submitthedocumentary.com
No Bystanders is the only way!
Cyberbullying is a legitimate, serious issue but if people really want change, the answer is to do something about the awful Communications Decency Act Section 230. Many internet companies do little to stop cyberbullying because of greed. Backpage, for instance, knows they have child sex trafficking ads on their site, but they do nothing about them because they don’t want lose ad hits as sick as it is. Websites like the the worst of the lot, Topix, don’t require users to register and accept no responsibility because of that law. It isn’t a case of free speech because libel and defamation aren’t protected speech. Because of that law companies can’t be sued directly and that is why they do nothing. Change that law where they can be sued directly if they fail to provide stronger safety measures or knowingly allow bullying and defamation to go on, yet do nothing about it and you will help immensely with the problem.
