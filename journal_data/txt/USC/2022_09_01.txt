Benefits outlined in a newly ratified contract between residents at the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center and L.A. County were paid out to members of the Committee of Interns and Residents/Service Employees International Union Tuesday. The agreement includes a 5.5% pay raise for all represented housestaff during its first year and 3.25% raises for the next two years, along with an increased housing stipend and funds for diversity training initiatives. 
Nearly two months after the contract was tentatively ratified June 5, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Aug. 2 to authorize the payment of $10,000 for the housing allowance and an additional $3,000 for CIR members employed with L.A. County as of June 15. Members also received a $1,375 signing bonus, as voted on during the Board’s June 28 meeting — a payment paid out to 23 SEIU Local 721 bargaining units.
“These payments are the result of good faith negotiations with our labor partners,” wrote L.A. County Chief Executive Officer Fesia A. Davenport in a Board letter Aug. 2. 
Base wage increases that cover cost of living adjustments will be paid out in October and additional payments will kick in October 2023. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Fund has been formed, and the establishment of a committee to administer the funds is underway, said Frances Gill, a second year psychiatry resident at LAC+USC and a member of the resident union’s bargaining team. 
Gill said her co-workers are “so happy” that the contract is now resolved and benefits have been paid out.
“It makes such a big difference in everybody’s lives, especially for the interns who are just starting and probably had to incur a lot of a lot of debt to move across the country and start up a new job,” Gill said. “It’s so expensive to live in Los Angeles.”
CIR/SEIU members advocated for the L.A. County Board of Supervisors contract ratification vote to be agendized following a delay from the tentative ratification. The resident union took several actions — an email campaign that saw more than 500 members email the Board in less than 24 hours and a public comment issued at a Board of Supervisors meeting — in an effort to expedite the resolution process.
A tentative agreement was reached three days after the resident union voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike that was set to take place between June 13 and June 15. LAC+USC residents alleged bad faith bargaining — including canceled bargaining sessions and little movement on proposals — from L.A. County throughout contract negotiations. 
The CIR/SEIU resident bargaining team was in touch with the L.A. County bargaining unit as of several weeks ago, following the payment authorization vote, while the teams were agreeing to a payout date. 
In an emailed statement to the Daily Trojan, the L.A. County Chief Executive Office wrote that though the three-year contract agreement was reached, the process is awaiting negotiation of the “comprehensive” Memorandum of Understanding, a document that describes in detail expectations and responsibilities between parties. 
“The County and the union have exchanged multiple drafts of the MOU, and the final MOU must also be reviewed by County Counsel, coordinated with the Auditor-Controller, and ratified by the Union’s general membership before being presented to the Board for approval,” the statement read.

I love a good collaboration. 
It’s hard sometimes when you are in transition between brands or only want to buy one item, and when in doubt, collaborations are the perfect compromise. Bigger brands this year have been pushing collaborations. One of the biggest collabs in the luxury market is Jacquemus x Nike, which shut down Jacquemus’ site and created warehouse and shipping problems, and as of Aug. 25, Levi’s x GUIZIO. 
Collaborations also tend to be more cost-efficient, especially when it comes to luxury brands working with “regular” apparel brands. For example, with Fendi x SKIMS, although $120 for a bodysuit seems arbitrary when considering Fendi’s luxury prices and the fact that SKIMS bodysuits often retail for $60, for a collaboration, it’s a fantastic deal. 
Yet, there are other brands that seize this opportunity to increase their prices to match the status of the more affluent partner. 
This is not news — we all are aware of this when browsing brands’ socials. So then why am I bringing this up?
Because The Business of Fashion reported that large apparel companies such as Walmart, Target, Victoria’s Secret, Urban Outfitters and Kohl’s  had to offer deep discounts due to a cutback in spending from their customers. 
Part of this comes from  consumer preference for deals and their willingness to pay for items. Whether this means they are entering stores with a budget in mind or are deciding between options, personally, unless I am in LOVE with one item over the other, I’ll often choose the cheaper and more cost-efficient option. And, almost everyone would rather spend $50 on three items instead of one. 
Simultaneously, what I’ve noticed is a change in what people are wearing in my demographic. While brands like UO and VS were the major companies in the world during my adolescent years, as I’ve gotten older, I have been straying away. My age group is getting older, and as a result, companies that have passed their prime are losing us in lieu of professional attire and capsule wardrobes. 
This isn’t solely because we’ve all discovered Pinterest, Aritzia and Matilda Djerf; we’re simply entering adulthood and the professional world, and in many traditional business settings, we can’t wear tube tops and parachute pants to give a presentation on quarterly sales reports or cybersecurity breaches. And, facing the beginning of paying our first month’s rent, understanding taxes and our first call to AAA, I, too, would rather build a capsule collection I could mix and match to save money for the scary unknowns of the future. 
Still, Margiela has created a new pair of shoes with Reebok, DIOR by BIRKENSTOCK has released a  $1,100 pair, and Adidas has just given us a preview of its collection with Thebe Magugu. 
So, do we “treat ourselves” every once in a while to a collaboration of our dreams as a way to be cost efficient? Or should we turn our backs once and for all on our younger days of begging our parents for overpriced necklaces and skirts?
With a pullback on spending, could this be an attempt for high(-er) end and luxury brands to prove their status again? Or is it their slow transition to more affordable prices in an attempt to gain more customers amidst the beginnings of global economic decline?
What does this mean for our newly rebirthed trend cycle? And how does this affect the role of influencers whose job is to stay “on-trend?”
I don’t have the answers; I am merely a 19-year-old fashion enthusiast. But maybe you do! Take this in, digest it and let me 
know what you think.

USC Hospitality reinstated pre-pandemic dining procedures following the rollout of new meal plan terms and accommodations for the 2022-23 school year. 
“Last year, we made a temporary change to our dining plans based on the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictions that were put upon us from the [Los Angeles] County Health Department,” said assistant vice president of USC Hospitality Dirk De Jong. “We had to de-densify the campus.”
The Apartment Meal Plan, required for sophomores, juniors and seniors living in USC Housing apartments, offers 40 residential meal swipes for use at any of the three on-campus residential dining halls and $150 dining dollars. However, the plan no longer provides  meal swipes that can be used at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Students on the Cardinal Meal Plan, required for all freshmen living in USC Housing and sophomores, juniors and seniors living in housing residence halls and suites, can use unlimited residential meal swipes at the three campus dining halls and two Campus Center meal swipes per week at the RTCC quick service restaurants — Burger Crush, C&G Juice Co., Seeds Marketplace and Taco Taco. 
Within RTCC, USC Hospitality will include new restaurants and meal options that students can purchase with Campus Center swipes or dining dollars, starting with the addition of the famous Law Cafe salmon bowls to the Seeds Marketplace next week. 
De Jong said USC Hospitality rebranded Verde as Taco Taco in order to reflect a modified menu inspired by the authentic flavor profile from an L.A. street taco stand. Set to open in September, a signature salad and sandwich concept will open in the space that Lemonade used to occupy in Seeds Marketplace. An Italian deli and pizza concept will replace The Kitchen restaurant in October.
Lindsay Thomas, a sophomore majoring in biology, said she doesn’t appreciate the “lack of freedom” in the Apartment Plan, which prompted her to reconsider applying for USC Housing.
“We can’t use meal swipes basically anywhere but dining halls,” she said. “It takes away a lot of the choice and flexibility that we should be able to have — living independently, having a kitchen — but we’re forced to pay $700 each semester … It makes it even worse for low-income students who are required to purchase this plan.”
The prices of all USC meal plans have increased by 4.5% in 2022-23 compared to 2021-22. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the consumer price index for food has increased by 10%. USC Hospitality said this difference provides more value to students in spite of inflationary pressures. 
USC Hospitality is developing a series of new dining accommodations for students, De Jong said. The first stretch of this plan began Wednesday, with the introduction of one to-go meal per day from any of the three on-campus residential dining halls.
“This is something that the student body has asked for quite some time, so we’re very excited,” De Jong said. “It will be set up at the stations as students walk in at the cashier station and they swipe and can indicate if they want to have their meal to-go. Then they will be issued a container and disposables so they can make their selections and then make their way out.”
USC Hospitality has also recently relaunched its Instagram page (@usccampusdining). Run by USC’s registered dietitian Lindsey Pine, the account aims to better facilitate communication and feedback between the student body and USC Hospitality.  
“[Pine] is highlighting all the various options that we have and for every student that has specific dietary restrictions or needs to have help for finding a healthy diet based on their specific situation,” De Jong said. “She has consulting opportunities where [students] can meet with her and where she can tell the students like where to go for what, including in our dining hall.”
This effort to provide more resources for students with dietary restrictions has received mixed reactions from students who have food allergies and restrictions. Ella Lavian, a gluten and lactose-free sophomore majoring in environmental studies, currently uses the Apartment Plan and said she relied heavily on meals from the RTCC last year to get by. 
“I knew that I could eat [at the RTCC], which took a weight off my shoulders and being able to eat socially is such an important part of actually building friendships because, of course, meals are a bonding experience,” Lavian said. “I don’t want all my friends to go eat at [the Village Dining Hall] together, and I’d have to be like ‘Sorry, there’s actually nothing I can eat there. I have to eat at [Everybody’s Kitchen] by myself.’”
At EVK and the Parkside Restaurant, Lavian and other gluten-free students use a gluten-free corner of the dining hall. Such an accommodation doesn’t exist at the USC Village Dining Hall, and Lavian said she has to ask chefs to make her something she can eat — which, she said, she often can’t get. 
“In [the Village Dining Hall], make a gluten-free corner,” she said. “They have those private dining rooms that nobody ever uses —  turn one of them into a gluten-free closet. Put it in a little fridge with some bread, some bagels. Give us a little bit more independence because it’s really, really frustrating.”

The beginning of the school year: a time of frivolity and seemingly endless freedom. Better capitalize on it while you can, as September has some major titles you can catch with many serious awards contenders for both film and television making their way to our screens. With a healthy dose of titles coming to streaming after runs in theaters as well as exclusives, there’s plenty to keep you busy while you continue to procrastinate. 
HBO Max
“Elvis” – Sept. 2
Maximalist is an understatement when describing Baz Luhrmann’s filmmaking style. “Elvis,” the hotly anticipated Elvis Presley biopic, is absolutely no exception. Having premiered this past May at the Cannes Film Festival, the film hit theaters worldwide in late June with significant praise directed towards Austin Butler’s impressive performance in the titular role. The film has been held as an exemplar of Luhrmann’s divisive idiosyncrasies and artistic tendencies. “Elvis” struck gold with audiences, grossing $277 million worldwide against a budget of $85 million, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all time. The film’s robust soundtrack is sure to impress avid music listeners and moviegoers alike with talent such as Doja Cat and Kacey Musgraves coming aboard to provide original new music in addition to modernized covers of Presley’s hits. If you feel like engaging in a little less conversation and having a night in, consider “Elvis” as your next watch. 
Prime Video
“The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” – Sept. 2
The first eight-episode season of this “The Lord of the Rings” television prequel series is finally landing on Prime Video on Sept. 2. This comes after the company made a five-season production commitment valued at approximately $1 billion, making the prequel the most expensive television series ever created. The series is set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, thousands of years before “The Hobbit” and the original “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. “The Rings of Power” arrives on the heels of the premiere of HBO’s “House of the Dragon,” another prequel series for the revered multi-season epic “Game of Thrones.” If you’re looking for something with a little bit of old and a little bit of new, you might find exactly what you’re looking for with “The Rings of Power.”
Netflix
“Blonde” – Sept. 28
The long-awaited Marilyn Monroe biopic “Blonde” finally arrives on Netflix this month, starring Ana de Armas as the eminent Hollywood actress and cultural icon. Production on “Blonde” began three years ago in August 2019 before finally wrapping up nearly two years later due to the coronavirus. The film is adapted from Joyce Carol Oates’ novel of the same name, which reimagined Marilyn Monroe in the eyes of the general public. The film already garnered significant awards buzz and praise from industry A-listers such as Jamie Lee Curtis and Brad Pitt (who is credited as a producer), who directed high remarks toward de Armas for her performance. “Blonde” is also the only film released this year to earn a NC-17 rating. Speaking on the matter, director Andrew Dominik said, “It’s a demanding movie. If the audience doesn’t like it, that’s the f**king audience’s problem. It’s not running for public office.” Although the NC-17 rating is attached, the film will have a theatrical release to coincide with its Netflix premiere.
Hulu
“The Handmaid’s Tale” Season 5 – Sept. 14
Hulu’s television sensation “The Handmaid’s Tale” is returning to screens this month with its fifth installment. The season will premiere with its first two episodes on Sept. 14 before releasing new episodes weekly. The series shows no signs of slowing down with 75 Emmy nominations and eight wins under its belt. Elisabeth Moss’ character June will face a major reckoning this season, with few other details provided. Be sure to catch up on the show now before the middle of the month rolls around!
Disney+
“Andor” – Sept. 21
The television prequel series don’t stop coming; “Andor” acts as a prequel to the “Star Wars”spin-off film “Rogue One,” following Rebel spy Cassian Andor during the five years prior to the events of the 2016 film. Andor will be played by Diego Luna, who played him in the 2016 film as well. “Andor” is the second “Star Wars” prequel series of the year, following “Obi Wan Kenobi,” which premiered in May to positive reviews and fan reception. The show’s creator, Tony Gilroy, emphasized in press appearances that he wanted the show to appeal to the sensibilities of “Star Wars” fans as well as those completely unfamiliar with the franchise. “Andor” will premiere its first three episodes on Sept. 21 before rolling out its remaining nine episodes weekly. A second 12-episode season is already in development, officially taking “Andor” out of miniseries territory. Between this and “The Rings of Power,” September might just be the month of familiarizing yourself with intellectual property you thought was long gone.
“Hocus Pocus 2” – Sept. 30
Here’s a curveball just about no one saw coming; 1993 cult classic “Hocus Pocus” is getting a sequel nearly 30 years later, and with part of its original cast no less. Stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy, and Doug Jones will reprise their roles from the original film. The sequel has been in talks for almost a decade at this point, with its original stars having made contradictory statements about their intentions or willingness to return for a sequel. By 2019, however, the stars put pen to paper for the project, delighting fans of the original. Part of the film’s production took place in Salem, MA, which is sure to satisfy the witchy cravings of “Hocus Pocus’” dedicated fan base. “Hocus Pocus 2” will be the perfect title to cap off September as we move into October and its onslaught of scares and thrills.

When selling the claims of a high-quality education at a prestigious institution with the prospect of a promising future, USC argues that affordability should never hinder one’s desire to become a part of the Trojan Family. 
The University’s Affordability Initiative, specifically designed to aid students receiving need-based funding, has been a hallmark of this marketing strategy in an effort to appear more affordable and in reach, despite the jarring $85,648 yearly price tag. One specific aspect of the initiative was that beginning Fall 2020, incoming first-year students coming from households making $80,000 or less would attend tuition free.
If all of this sounds too good to be true – especially considering USC’s past scandals regarding money and donations – you would be correct. 
Recent outcries from students online recount all the ways USC’s financial aid system has failed its students, leaving certain individuals on the brink of homelessness. From Instagram to Reddit, Trojans have shared distressing stories about their experiences with USC financial aid services.  
One student shared on the Reddit thread r/USC how the financial aid office practically stole their fellowship grant saying, “Over the summer, I was awarded a Undergraduate Research Associate Program fellowship position and was granted money for working 24 hrs per week. This fall semester I found out my university grant had lowered by the same amount as the amount I got awarded by URAP… now I owe money to the university for working those hours over the summer and am in the negative for the summer because of my summer rent.”
Others have shared how students can save money by giving up their meal plan. One would hope that the University holds the belief that students should not have to choose between their education and their health.  But they don’t and it doesn’t just stop at physical health. 
Another student shared on r/USC, “this is honestly extremely stressful. I’ve burned out from trying to find workarounds for the past month. It’s giving me panic attacks and meltdowns, and I think it’s best to just throw in the towel and take the next semester to year off until USC can offer me housing … I’m extremely uncertain about my future here and I’m hoping to just seek therapy after a suffocating summer I endured.”
According to USC’s 2020 Financial Report, the University maintains a “need-blind” admission to guarantee a high-quality education to its most deserving applicants, and claims to “meet in full” the demonstrated financial needs of undergraduate students. However, all these claims are empty promises, upholding USC’s embarrassing reputation of being an elitist institution that works for the rich, upper class students, leaving other students to fend for themselves. 
With an endowment of $8.1 billion as of 2021, USC has more than enough money to meet the needs of low-income and financially independent students. If anything, the institution has a moral obligation to do so, considering the need-blind admissions that paint USC as an equitable university that values merit and talent above all. 
However, this is not the first time USC has acted fraudulently. In the past year, a group of residential assistants went on a strike after receiving cuts to their financial aid. Financial assistance was lowered after it was revealed that the financial aid office no longer considers housing costs when calculating aid for residential assistants, leaving many in a worse financial situation.
What appears to be the most ominous aspect of this plan is that many students needing financial aid will be left with very little options in terms of their futures. Some students may need to drop out of school, while others may take out huge loans to pay back in the future. Seniors looking to graduate this spring don’t even have the option of leaving USC unless they give up their hopes of obtaining their degrees. Even when students try to appeal or talk to anyone from the financial aid office, they get placed on hold for so long that many just give up. On the Financial Aid Services and Tasks page, the office has asked for students’ patience, as they are receiving a high volume of calls and emails, but students have been beyond patient and many can’t afford to wait any longer.
If USC can’t keep the promises outlined in their Affordability Initiative, they have the responsibility to stop making false pledges to their student body. 
Attending USC should be for the educational growth of its students. Education is one of the most valuable tools that can help students climb the social ladder to avoid poverty and homelessness in the future. Despite this, USC’s constant prioritization of profit over their students wields education as a weapon rather than a helping hand to its most vulnerable population. 
Don’t lure in students with the guise of covering their tuition just to trap them in financial debt and turmoil. 
If USC truly believes that they are an equitable institution able to provide quality education to all, it must begin there.

USC men’s water polo is back  and the team is going for an NCAA title this season. The Trojans are coming off of a successful 2021 season, finishing second in the NCAA tournament with an 18-3 record overall. 
USC has made it to the NCAA tournament for 17 consecutive years, and the 2021 season marked their 16th year competing in the championship match. Last season, the Trojans fell to UC Berkeley, a tough ending to an impressive season for Southern California. While the Golden Bears are looking for a back-to-back title this season, the Trojans are looking for something, too: redemption. 
Head coach Marko Pintaric, a former USC All-American believes the competition will be close this season.
“Competition is very level this year … Aside from the usual suspects — Cal, UCLA, Stanford — there are teams that are more evenly balanced, and it will be interesting to see how everybody will perform this season,” Pintaric said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “You can’t relax against anybody.” 
Pintaric has been on the USC coaching staff for 21 years, and has an overall record of 23-15 as the head coach of the men’s team. In his first season as head coach in 2019, Pintaric led the Trojans to their 16th consecutive NCAA Tournament and a 15-6 record. 
In terms of roster changes this season, there has been quite a bit of turnaround.
“We have significantly changed our roster from last year in terms of who played in the NCAA final game. We will greatly miss our All-Americans Nic Porter, Hannes Daube and Jacob Mercep,” Pintaric said. 
However, new blood and strong leadership are two things that Pintaric believes will balance out this season’s roster. 
“This year, we have plenty of players who  stepped in. We have two returning seniors, Jake Ehrhardt and Ashworth Molthen, and a supporting staff of Marcus Longton, Chris Sturtevant [and] Carson Krantz, who really performed [well] during the summer,” Pintaric said. 
The team spent all summer training and playing against teams in Croatia and Spain. This trip marked a turning point for this group of players, not only skills-wise but in regards to team chemistry as well.
“I think that our time abroad this summer was really valuable to our team because not only did it expose us to a different style of play – which helps us be better adapted for whatever we might face this season – but it was also an incredible opportunity to get closer as a team, not just through water polo,” said senior driver Longton. He is starting his fourth season at USC as a top scorer, scoring 28 goals last season with a career high of five goals in one game against Pepperdine University. 
Alongside Longton is fifth-year Ehrhardt, a 2-meter who played for the National Team this summer. 
“I learned a lot this summer,” Ehrhardt said. “[I] got to play in my first world championship tournament, so that gave me a lot of experience and it taught me a lot of things about how to be a leader.” 
Ehrhardt scored five goals at the 2022 Fédération Internationale de Natation World Championships in Budapest. At USC last season, Ehrhardt was a top scorer, bringing in 35 goals over the course of a season. Ehrhardt has been an All-American for the past four years, and is ranked No. 26 in scoring, with 124 goals total in his career. 
The Trojans’ main competition this season is Cal, the final team USC could not beat last December at NCAAs.
“I know they’ve been working hard this entire offseason, so I’m assuming they’re going to be our toughest opponents,” Ehrhardt said. 
This season, both Longton and Ehrhardt have one main goal in mind: an NCAA championship. 
“We want to bring a ring to this generation of players,” Ehrhardt said. “We were able to do that in 2018, but since that championship, we haven’t been able to get a ring for this group of seniors right now, so it’s going to be really important.”
Longton agrees, saying that the “…overall attitude for this season is the same as any other season. Our goal is that national championship, and that never changes with this program.”
For their first competition of the season, the Trojans will head to San Diego to face Concordia University and UC Irvine on Sept. 3 at the 2022 Triton Invitational. USC returns home to face Long Beach State and Golden West Sept. 8.

After opening the season 1-1 on the road, USC women’s soccer gets ready to host the No. 6 Texas Christian University Horned Frogs this Thursday.
USC started their season with a 0-3 loss in West Lafayette against Purdue University, before returning to the West Coast and defeating Long Beach State 1-0 Sunday afternoon. Sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer scored the lone goal for the Trojans. 
However, the Trojans are far stronger than their record thus far would suggest. 
“Last spring, we were playing more with each other, with more freedom as our lineup became older,” junior defender and midfielder Zoe Burns said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We have more experience this year going into this season, and so I think we feel really confident in what we have been building for the last six months.”
Now, the Trojans are getting ready to take on their toughest opponent so far this season.
“We feel pretty prepared. We feel like we have taken a good amount of rest and also mixing it with hard trainings to prepare for TCU, because they’re a really good team,” said sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall. “We feel good coming off our win from the week before, so we’re going to try and take that momentum into this game.”
Offensively, the Trojans are looking for a hot start to keep their momentum running from their previous win.
“We have a really fast team, we have really fast forwards and people out wide, and I feel like that’s an area that we could win games with,” Courtnall said. “Our speed, getting crosses in and then we have people in the middle that are really good finishers.”
USC will also benefit from the return of three of their top players from stints with their respective national teams: both Courtnall and Burns played with the Canadian National Team at the U-20 World Cup, while sophomore forward Simone Jackson joined the United States team. Courtnall and Burns were also joined on team Canada by sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo, who remains on the national team to join them in their upcoming matches.
Now, USC looks to show off the work they have put in since the spring and the new direction they are taking under first-year head coach Jane Alukonis.
“I think we are really excited to show the NCAA and show everybody watching that we have been working and we are coming out with a different style,” Burns said. “But I think that a lot of us just love what we are doing and we are all really buying in. I think TCU is very good, and it’s a huge opportunity for us to make that known.”
The TCU game will be the Trojans’ first opportunity to show off for USC fans in person, as Thursday marks their home opener for the season.
“It gives us more energy for the game,” Courtnall said. “Getting to see your classmates and friends and family at your game, watching you in person, just brings a whole other level to the game, because you want to play well for them.”
More than anything, with the return of their top players, the Trojans are ready to take on TCU and every other team they face on the path to the NCAAs this season.
“We are a national championship caliber team, and if we really put all of the steps we need to do together, that we could reach that level,” Courtnall said. “The end goal is always to win a national championship, and I think we have so many talented players that we could do that if we just work as hard as possible and do what we need to do each game.”
USC takes on TCU Thursday Sept. 1 at 3 p.m. at Soni McAlister Field.
