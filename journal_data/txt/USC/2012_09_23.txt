The USC men’s water polo team’s matchup against No. 4 California was one that could have easily knocked it off its championship stride.

Instead, the Trojans gutted out a back-and-forth game Sunday and came out with a 7-6 victory at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
“We needed to outwork them,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said, who earned his 400th win Sunday. “Against Cal, you cannot let them beat you up and down the pool. I thought we did a very good job of that today.”
In a rare nationally televised contest on ESPNU, junior driver Nikola Vavic struggled throughout the game against Cal’s defense, but came through in the most crucial moment to score the winning goal with 1:38 left in the game.
“I played an all-around bad game,” the younger Vavic said. “I’m just glad that I had an opportunity like that, and that it all worked out.”
In the first half, each team was able to take advantage of 6-on-5 opportunities. The two sides alternated goals in the first quarter, until Cal scored at the buzzer to take the early 3-2 lead.
No. 1 USC struggled through most of the second quarter to contain the Golden Bears’ attack. Goals by junior Hunter Gettelfinger and freshman Colin Mulcahy pushed Cal out to a 5-3 lead before junior two-meter Jeremy Davie scored just before halftime.
“We were giving up easy shots in the first half,” Vavic said. “Their goalie got hot, and it’s tough to score on a hot goalie. But we played 13 players [in the first half], so our key guys were well-rested for the second half.”
That extra rest paid dividends, as USC would hold Cal scoreless in the third quarter. The Trojans were able to draw level after sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias fought hard against two Cal defenders to score his second goal of the game.
“In the beginning, our defense was not focused enough, but we got better in the second half,” Genidounias said. “We were trying to drop the ball into the 1- and 2-meters to get some ejections, and we did that and scored a couple goals. That’s what won us this game.”
In the fourth quarter, a defensive lapse led to a Cal goal that gave them the lead with just more than seven minutes remaining. With 5:25 left, USC answered with a goal by junior utility Mace Rapsey that was set up after a key block by junior goalie James Clark.
“James played extremely well today,” Vavic said. “He made some really key blocks, but also just his presence in the goal was very effective.”
After a USC foul gave Cal a power play with just more than two minutes remaining, USC’s defense tightened up to force a turnover. In the ensuing possession, a foul on Cal gave the Trojans a power play of their own, and unlike the Bears, they were able to take advantage with Vavic’s only goal of the game.
After the go-ahead score, Cal had two opportunities to tie the game but was turned away by Clark and the USC defense.
In addition to giving the Trojans the lead, Vavic’s goal moved him up to No. 20 on the all-time USC scoring list, an achievement that Vavic placed little to no importance on after the game.
“It means nothing,” Vavic said. “As long as we win, I’m happy.”

The USC women’s volleyball team saw its remarkable season-opening winning streak come to an abrupt end Friday, as Pac-12 rival Oregon recorded a 3-0 victory at the Galen Center to hand the Women of Troy their first loss of the season.
Not enough · Junior outside hitter Sara Shaw had five kills and seven digs in Friday’s loss to Oregon. USC now stands at 13-1 overall. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The No. 2 Women of Troy, who entered the match having won their first 13 matched and swept nine of them, couldn’t muster enough strength to overcome the No. 8 Ducks, who took the match 25-19, 25-15, 25-23 and extended their own season-opening winning streak to 11. The loss marked the first time USC fell to Oregon at home since 1990.
Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller, one of the team’s most steady contributors thus far, led the Women of Troy with nine kills at a hitting percentage of .318. Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio recorded seven kills to back up Fuller.
The Women of Troy faced the Ducks just two nights after a resounding 3-1 victory over No. 1 UCLA Wednesday night, but struggled to maintain consistency throughout the match.
Oregon began the match with a strong attack and never looked back, holding the lead the entire way to capture the first set 25-19. The Women of Troy tied the score at four different points throughout the set, but were unable to penetrate the Oregon defense.
The Ducks posted an impressive .486 hitting percentage in the first frame, logging 19 kills on 35 swings. Meanwhile, the Women of Troy, for whom attacking has been a point of concern for USC coach Mick Haley, hit at a .235 clip, but could not generate any momentum as Oregon went up 24-17. A kill by Bricio failed to start a rally, as senior Katherine Fischer knocked down her sixth kill of the set to give the Ducks the win. More importantly, the Ducks recorded two errors in the set, a statistic that has plagued Haley’s team as well.
Before the TCU Molten Invitational on Sept. 14 and 15, Haley was adamant about consistent offensive improvement, saying, “We need to work on individual improvement so that we have options in our rotation.”
The second set, however, saw even more dominance by Oregon, as they registered 16 kills and compiled a steady .414 hitting percentage. The Women of Troy struggled to develop offense, hitting at a clip of just .036. The Ducks maintained a strong push, overcoming an early 4-3 deficit to take a 13-7 lead. The Women of Troy again failed to rally, and Oregon closed out a 10-point victory to take the middle frame.
In an attempt to salvage the match, the Women of Troy put forth their best effort in the third set, but once again came up short. The set was by far the most competitive of the match, as the teams exchanged leads six times and registered 14 ties throughout the frame. A kill by junior outside hitter Sara Shaw gave USC a 9-7 lead, but Oregon came back to take a 14-13 lead on a kill by senior Alaina Bergsma. The Ducks overcame eight errors to take the set 25-23, handing the Women of Troy their first sweep of the season.
Statistically, the Women of Troy were done in by their offensive woes, as only two other players (junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard and Shaw) recorded five kills. By contrast, Oregon received double-digit kills from three players and hit at a clip of .357, while the Women of Troy attacked at a rate of .189.
Haley insists the loss won’t mean much to the team in the long run.
“We can’t afford to lose our confidence if we lose a match or two,” Haley said. “We can’t think so much about wins or losses, but instead about improvement. We need to stay hydrated, practice and focus on winning each rotation.”
The Women of Troy will head north next weekend for two Pac-12 matches, taking on Washington on Friday night before a matchup against Washington State on Sunday night.
First match I attended this season, and sat on opposite side usually sit behind the team benches for first time
at Galen Ctr. This is the 2nd worst performance after ucla of last year in home arena. This has to be a wake up
call for team or season lost. The sad part that there was no real adjustment made to offset the first set of going
through the motions once Ducks got a few pts. ahead. Emily Young gave the team some spark and should have
played more using her left handedness to disrupt the defense used against the Trojans.

The USC women’s soccer team opened Pac-12 conference play  Friday by earning its first shutout of the season, as senior forward Samantha Johnson notched the game-winning goal in the 100th minute to defeat Washington 1-0.
As they have all this season, the Women of Troy (4-4-1, 1-0) created plenty of chances against the Huskies (7-2-1, 0-1). USC outshot Washington 24-9 at McAlister Field, and had 10 corner kicks, including three in the 10-minute overtime period.
But none managed to get past Washington goalkeeper Kari Davidson, who recorded seven saves, until Johnson’s shot with 11 seconds left in the first overtime period.
“I was just hoping someone would get [a goal],” Johnson said. “I didn’t care who it was. We all just tried to work hard for each other.”
A long throw-in from freshman defender Marlee Carrillo sent the ball into the box, where junior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy tapped it to Johnson, who unleashed a screaming blast from her right foot.
Davidson got a hand on it, but she couldn’t stop the final strike from reaching the back of the net.
It was Johnson’s second late game-winner in a week, after the senior scored with 15 seconds left on the road against San Diego last Friday for the win.
“It was just a matter of time, I was hoping,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “But the way things have been going, I was also very fearful of giving one away.”
Fortunately for USC, the defense held strong, bolstered by the returns of senior Kristina Noriega (concussion) and redshirt sophomore Mia Bruno (quad strain) to the starting lineup.
“The experience and the composure we gained in the back with the two of them is huge,” Khosroshahin said. “It was a total team commitment of being aware of getting back [on defense] and not taking unnecessary risks in the back.”
Noriega agreed with her coach. “We just came together and worked as a unit,” she said. “[Washington] had a little bit of speed up top but for the most part we handled it well.”
USC sophomore goalkeeper Caroline Stanley was impressive, posting four key saves, but the Women of Troy dominated possession so well that the Huskies’ chances were few and far between.
USC, on the other hand, had lots of opportunities to put the game away.
Junior midfielder Jordan Marada slotted a dangerous pass to junior midfielder Haley Boysen in the 81st minute deep in the left side of the box, but Boysen’s attempt was blocked just before the goal line and cleared.
A Washington handball in the 86th minute gave USC a golden opportunity right outside the box, but Johnson’s attempt of the ensuing free kick sailed just over the crossbar.
A few minutes into overtime, Eddy passed to freshman forward Katie Johnson for an early look at the winner, but the Huskies managed another team save on the goal line.
“We just kept talking about getting numbers forward and taking care of the ball,” Khosroshahin said. “Anytime you can get opportunities like that along with the run of play, it bodes well for your team.”
Johnson said shutting out the Huskies in the home conference opener will do wonders for the confidence of the young Women of Troy, who don’t have another home match for almost a month.
“It was really important only because our preseason was pretty rough,” Johnson said. “So we weren’t all that confident, but it’s good today because this actually brings up our confidence, so we’re ready to go on the road and get a few wins.”
The Women of Troy visit Arizona State in Tempe on Friday for a 2 p.m. match before going to Tucson, Ariz., for a 1:30 p.m. clash on Sunday against Arizona.

In the waning moments of USC’s 27-9 victory over California on Saturday, the “Twitterverse” exploded with harsh commentary.
Standing tall · Senior center Khaled Holmes’ physical play against Cal signaled a marked change for the Trojans’ entire offensive demeanor. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
No, it wasn’t about senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s pair of interceptions. It wasn’t about the team’s nearly 300 rushing yards or the fact that the defense didn’t give up a single touchdown.
No, most of the attention centered on senior center Khaled Holmes. More specifically, the criticism dealt with the fact that he left the field with an injury again after writhing on the ground in pain.
Now, we don’t know specifics, but given the fact that Holmes left the Syracuse game with assistance from a cart, it’s safe to assume the injuries were related, although we can’t say for sure. Though many on Twitter lauded Holmes for playing through the injury, more of the comments were negative.
Namely, they were attacking USC for letting him play.
I understand where people are coming from. No one ever wants to see a player get hurt, especially one like Holmes, a team captain and a future NFL Draft pick. It would have made sense to sit him in a game like this; there is a lot of season left and Holmes needs to be healthy for the “big games” like Washington and Oregon. If Holmes is out for an extended period of time, things could take a turn for the worse.
But the decision to play Holmes, even given the fact that he left the game in obvious pain, was one USC needed. Last week, without Holmes, the Trojans were completely manhandled on the offensive line by Stanford’s defensive front seven. They ran for less than 30 yards on the day and Barkley was sacked four times. For perspective, he was sacked seven times all of last season.
USC needed to make a statement. They needed to be physical. They needed to be tough. They needed to run the ball down someone’s throat.
Senior running back Curtis McNeal ran for 115 yards while junior Silas Redd ran for 158. In total, the Trojans ran for 296 yards. Barkley wasn’t sacked once. The offensive line got a push that was clearly not there in Palo Alto.
USC’s offense had to physically dominate an opponent to show that they still had a chance in the Pac-12 race and on a national level. Holmes provided that. Do I think the Trojans could have beaten Cal without Holmes? Absolutely. USC is too talented. But it wouldn’t have been the type of win that they needed. The Trojans needed to dominate the game, and while the scoreboard might not show it, they did. They manhandled Cal like Stanford manhandled USC the week before.
And it was in large part because of Holmes.
If Holmes doesn’t play for a while, I might look stupid for praising the decision to play him Saturday. If he misses time, there’s a chance the Trojans lose more games and fall out of the national title picture.
But during a season where things were hanging in the balance after a tough loss,and where things could have turned sour for USC if the offense hadn’t come out with a good performance, Khaled Holmes was there to make sure that the ship was righted.
And there was no way that he was going to make that sort of a difference watching from the sideline. For all we know, this win could have saved USC’s season. At least, it did for now. And without Holmes, it wouldn’t have been the same, regardless of any outcome.
USC had to win with toughness and raw physicality. A finesse win was not going to cut it.
And for that, I cannot fault the Trojans for playing Holmes. In fact, I applaud them. Kiffin and company knew what they had to do to make a statement to save their season. They had to be nasty on the offensive line. And the only way to do that was with Holmes on the field, regardless of injury.
I certainly hope Holmes isn’t out for any extended period of time. ESPN’s Brett McMurphy reported that he was told by Khaled’s brother Alex that he “just tweaked his ankle,” and that he’ll be “OK.”
But regardless of what happens, his play Saturday set the tone for the Trojans for the rest of the season: Barkley might get the headlines, but offensive line play and the running game are where the battles will ultimately be won.

I have to agree with the author. USC had no choice and needed to play Holmes. Without him they looked lost and vunerable… I hope he is ok so USC can salvage the season!

Curtis McNeal spent about five minutes Saturday standing in the middle of a battered Coliseum field answering questions from reporters. His message, however simple, proved telling.
Running away · Senior tailback Curtis McNeal ran for 116 yards on just 10 carries Saturday afternoon at the Coliseum. The No. 13 Trojans ran for a season-high 296 yards in their 27-9 victory over the Golden Bears. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“It was the offensive line,” the senior running back said of USC’s 27-9 win over California. “It was all just the offensive line.”
McNeal got his point across: USC at last got its running game going, thanks in large part to its offensive line.
One week after rushing for just 26 yards on 28 carries in a crushing seven-point loss in their Pac-12 opener at Stanford, the No. 13 Trojans bounced back with 296 yards on the ground to notch their ninth consecutive win over the Golden Bears.
USC’s pair of running backs trudged all over a Cal front seven with 158 yards coming from junior Silas Redd and 115 by way of McNeal, the first time the team had two players each rush for more than 100 yards in a single game since a 2008 contest at Washington State.
“They opened up holes for me and Silas and we just hit them,” said McNeal, who finished with his fifth-career 100-yard game.
USC (3-1, 1-1) posted nearly 500 yards in total offense, but for a change, a majority of them came on the ground as the team made a concerted effort to re-energize its running game, which had not only struggled at various points in the previous weeks but had been seemingly neglected as well.
On the third play from scrimmage, McNeal took a handoff from senior quarterback Matt Barkley for 62 yards, racing down the south sidelines before being knocked out at the 4-yard line. Though the Trojans would fail to score on the drive following an interception from Barkley two plays later, the tone was set early: USC was going to run. The team finished with 153 rushing yards over the first two quarters to grab a 17-3 halftime lead.
“The game was won at the line of scrimmage,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “That’s really the story of the day: up front.”
And so USC’s efforts running the ball overshadowed a passing game that never really got going, with drops from sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee and junior wide receiver Robert Woods. Barkley would also finish with two interceptions, moving his total to five on the season. He finished with just seven interceptions in 446 attempts in 2011.
“It’s fun winning 50-0, but that doesn’t happen every week unfortunately,” Kiffin said. “And so some games will be like this.”
To give its offensive line a boost, USC played a bit of musical chairs with its front five. After being sidelined the week prior because of an ankle injury, senior Khaled Holmes returned to the lineup to start at center. Meanwhile, senior Abe Markowitz replaced sophomore Marcus Martin at left guard, while sophomore Aundrey Walker, who started the first three games, rotated with freshman Max Tuerk at left tackle.
Kiffin opened up the competition at left tackle earlier in the week after expressing displeasure with Walker’s effort in the team’s Pac-12 opener against Stanford.
“It got some fire under my butt,” said Walker, who eventually played most of the snaps during the second half. “I liked it. It got me to work harder, to get better.”
As controlling as its offensive line was, perhaps, the Trojans’ defensive line was even more impressive. Led by junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, as well as the return of a fully healthy senior defensive end Wes Horton, they would record seven sacks, pressuring Cal quarterback Zach Maynard, who would complete just 18 of his 33 passes. He also threw two interceptions.
“They’re coming around,” USC defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron said. “They’ve done some good things. They still have some things to get better at. We were more productive than we have been, though. We made some plays.”
Breslin, in particular, had a few big plays. The junior college transfer led the group with three sacks, the most for any USC player since Rey Maualuga had three against Illinois in the 2008 Rose Bowl. Horton would also record his first sack of the season during the second quarter.
“[Breslin’s] a natural pass rusher,” Horton said. “He has a great mindset of taking it from the film room onto the field. He just keeps getting better and better every week.”
USC has held Cal (1-3, 0-1) to nine points or fewer in five of their last seven meetings.
“That is an explosive offense, and at the end of the day we won it up front,” Kiffin said. “I’m extremely proud of our players. Throughout the week a lot of people were trying to get in and tear them apart. They did a great job of preparing.”
 
Quick Hits
— Andre Heidari resumed field-goal kicking duties against Cal after missing the previous two weeks because of a leg injury sustained in the season opener against Hawai’i. The sophomore kicker made both of his attempts: a 40-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 41-yard kick in the fourth. He was also 3 for 3 on extra-point attempts.
— USC’s announced attendance of 83,421 at the Coliseum was about 10,000 shy of a sellout. The school had sold out its last two home games, Sept. 1 against Hawai’i and last season’s finale against UCLA. Its upcoming November contests against Oregon and Notre Dame have also been announced as sellouts.
— USC does not play next week. Its next game is Oct. 4 when the Trojans travel to Salt Lake City to face Utah in a rare Thursday primetime matchup. The game kicks off at 6 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN.

Going Greek remains a part of the college cliché: Join a house, get wasted every weekend, schlep your way through classes and make lifelong friends — essentially, Animal House but in real life.
Last week, an article from a website called Betches Love This highlighted USC as a top national school, worthy of the “betchiest of betches.” Though true in many regards, something was missing from the portrayal of our school, as a large portion of the article was dedicated to Greek life.
Though it’s highly entertaining — who doesn’t love reading about scandalous house reputations? — Greek life isn’t the only way to become socially active on campus.
Non-Hellenic collegiate society, fear not! If you didn’t rush a house, then you’re automatically part of an even larger community known as Gamma Delta Iota. Though it uses the same lauded alphabet as our school’s finest, GDI means you belong without belonging. The term, which alternatively stands for godd–n independent, can be used ironically or seriously. Some join this group by choice, others when the rush process doesn’t pan out the way they imagined it would.
Either way, not being Greek doesn’t mean you’re out of the loop when it comes to having an enviable social life, despite what recent articles might suggest. There are plenty of ways to make the most of it even when you can’t partake in Fratty Friday. After all, GDIs invented GDIF (godd–n it’s Friday) — kind of like TGIF, but so much better.
Greeks may have The Row, but GDIs have rows and rows of other streets at their disposal. Nobody throws a real house party like the houses located beyond the relative safety of 28th Street; the danger of not knowing whether the Department of Public Safety or the Los Angeles Police Department will show up only adds to the hedonistic revelry. Isn’t everything a little more thrilling when you know you’re not allowed to do it?
GDIs might not have personalized tank tops, but that’s half the charm. You can’t encompass their interesting qualities in a witty shirt phrase.
Being GDI is really more of an attitude; in fact, you could be in a house and still think like a GDI. This attitude entails doing what you want, regardless of others’ opinions. The Betches article does a nice job of conveying this demeanor in its writing style, but its content is sorely lacking in diversity. The social life of any Trojan involves so much more than Monday night dinners and deliveries.
Trojan GDIs know how to make the most of their city; whether you’re originally from Los Angeles or not, there’s no excuse for not knowing your city like the back of your hand. GDIs at USC realize this and thus can navigate this neck of the woods far better than those written about in the Betches article.
Our school’s choice location allows us the best of nearly all Los Angeles has to offer. Unlike our furry rivals across town, we get street cred for living, as the article points out, “deep in the a–hole of Los Angeles.” We can engage in philanthropic activities with the surrounding community that enrich our students in ways other schools can’t offer.
Equally as important, Downtown Los Angeles is down the street. As in, go a few blocks up Figueroa Street and you have an endless supply of culturally rich entertainment at your disposal. LA Live is adequate for dinner and a movie, but a true Trojan GDI knows how to access the burgeoning neighborhoods and districts of Downtown.
It’s common knowledge to every GDI at USC that the Arts District is the go-to area for a good time. Urth Caffe and Wurstküche are popular destinations, but this district also has Eat.Drink.Americano, a tasty New American brewery, and the Novel Café, a great spot for coffee and finishing homework. Not to mention, the streets of this area are lined with thought-provoking street art that ranges from the mainstream — D*Face has graced some buildings with his work — to the abstract and absurd. What else could a free-thinker ask for?
For the classier nights that we all attempt to have, the Rooftop Bar at The Standard and The Edison are actually good selections, so there’s one thing done right in the Betches article. If you’re not into braving the streets of Downtown, however, our campus is surrounded by plenty of freeway options that can take you to other GDI hotspots: Los Feliz Village, Abbot Kinney and Silver Lake.
A large factor that separates Trojan GDIs from those of other schools is that our students actually do intermingle. Normally, GDI is used to separate the Greeks and non-Greeks, but being the culturally savvy Angelenos that we are, we know how to embrace the term and exploit the opportunity for diversity.
Like any other social label, such as being Greek, GDI and its implications should be taken with a grain of salt. Nobody can really be categorized by a few simple adjectives, especially Trojans. We play by our own rules and wouldn’t have it any other way — keeping true to the betchy spirit that makes us both envied and hated.

Sometimes I wish we could poll the entire community at USC with their image of fraternities with two simple answers: good or bad. 
Maybe there is a good side to fraternities, but the image that comes out of The Row is not entirely a positive one as many of the above comments have pointed out. Moreover, the more prevalent frat guys always seem pompous and obnoxious. I don’t think that Greek life is all about this, but the image I get is it’s all about partying and screwing every “hot” girl you see. 
Greeks have an image problem; it’s not our fault the rest of us may think negatively of you guys. Most importantly, you say we don’t know because we aren’t exposed but the whole system is quite selective and closed. You either have to be Greek or a girl to be exposed to The Row.
Criticizing “Betches Love This” for only highlighting Greek Life at USC is like criticizing E! News for not covering the 2012 political campaign.
How can I make your picture bigger so I can finish?
This article, but most notably the comments section, has instilled in me some real sadness about this school that I love so. Never seen so much hideous jealousy oozing from ill-intended words. Get a life, geeds.
I just think it’s interesting that greek life at USC seems to only be The Row.  There are 4 other greek councils aside from what we see on the row but no one mentions us. Good thing is that we are never associated with the more negative comments and such but the bad thing is that people don’t know enough about greek life at our school to know there is more to the diversity in Greek life than people assume and that we don’t all fall into a common stereotype.
Being in a Fraternity or Sorority does not necessarily mean getting drunk every nite, etc. Rather, most of the Fraternities and Sororities I am familiar with, and I am a regional officer for one of the very best Fraternities, made very famous by one of your Graduates who was very prominent in many motion pictures, etc. Our Fraternity teaches us the three main ingredients for a good life are Friendship, Justice and Learning. It has nothing to do with Animal House and, for what it is worth, that picture made its backers many millions of dollars at the expense of the Fraternities and Sororities it slandered and made fun of. But, in truth, one of the greatest benefits I personally have derived was the great networking that I was allowed to enjoy over the past 44 years since my initiation, not to mention the many wonderful friendships I have made since then and the great pleasure I have giving back to the undergraduates who I regularly interact with several times during the school year. I am very proud of what I see of the many young men who have chosen to become Fraternity men in my fraternity and several others I am familiar with. Of course you do have your exceptions and we are only too painfully aware of those but, to our credit, we do take the necessary steps to correct their behavior or, pull their chapter charter if the need calls for it. But, you should not condemn the many because of the few. My advice: find out more about your subject before you condemn everyone of them.
Richard,
Maybe you can explain the whole gang shower Sigma Chi thing.   Is it mandatory or just bi-curious?
“Of course there are exceptions…. “I seriously hope you’re not trying to suggest that all frats and the ridiculous frat boys running around campus are mostly like yourself, Richard. Your experience with frats as “young men” who make “wonderful friendships” and “great networking” is the real exception. 
Shall I repeat: YOU’RE the exception. You cannot deny the inordinate amount of homophobia, sexism, and racism running rampant in the Greek Row at USC. I’m so tired of the few whiney frat people who are subject to slight criticism and jest like this article, and then y’all throw around  the fact that you actually do a bunch of philanthropy and other BS y’all spew it as IF it makes up for or legitimizes the insipid frat and sorority culture you all have festering. Maybe you should quit doing philanthropy and work on educating your own communities instead.  And you’re an absolute joke if you think frats address or “Take the necessary steps to correct their behavior.” 
My advice: Get a clue. The condemnations are completely legitimate, and rather than deny the obvious discrepancies from what YOU think frat world is like (which sounds like a la-la land of white people prancing around the corporate world while holding hands in brotherly love…sober) and from what’s reality, take responsibility for the community you seem to have so much pride in. Reality is females at USC are date-raped on the row frequently. Homophobia is rampant. Sexism is rampant. Wake up.
Beta is totally gay friendly
Fight on.
Melissa,
You words are truly spoken like someone who only has familiarity with Greek life through what you have seen on TV and in films and what you have read in articles like this one. So my advice to you: get a clue. 
We preach about “wonderful friendships” and “great networking” because they are not the exception, they are the RULE. It is the number one benefit that has become the product of those 4 years in the fraternity, and I have seen this amongst “young men” from every single house on the row. 
Of course the things that you associate with our “insipid” culture do occur: we do drink, we do throw parties and certain members throw out homophobic and sexists slurs. But these are 17 and 18 year old boys who join these fraternities, I would hasten to bet that you would find the exact same behavior in a group of 17/18 year boys in the college environment outside of the fraternity system. But the truth is that the men who mature in their 4 years in the fraternity system will by and large, and disproportionately, be not only the biggest contributors to the university, but to their communities and society at large – and I am not just saying this, we have statistical proof. And please refrain from throwing out accusation of date rape without any real argument – in my 4 years at USC and involvement since then there were far more sexual harassment and sexual abuse cases brought forward involving non-Greeks than Greeks. 
And for our alleged 20 percent presence amongst undergrads it is a fact that we are far more involved in philanthropic activities than our 80 percent non-Greek peers – and not just our on Row activities but involvement in JEP, the USC Volunteer center and community outreach. 
So wake up Melissa, maybe visit one of the sororities in any of our Greek Councils and see the contributions that the system makes to the lives of its members. 
So wake up Melissa.
“I laugh knowing you reside in the chlamydia, gonorrhea, yeast-infected cesspool known as 28th St. Keep acting cool knowing the only friends you have are the ones you were forced to artificially bond with.” 
“I’m sorry my family doesn’t make enough money for me to waste on your precious frat-star life that you seem to only know about.”
It’s funny how much these GDI’s seem to stereotype the Greek population. 
I’ve had a single lifestyle while being in a frat and never had to deal with sexually questionable situations or the STD’s you’re referring too. I am now in a healthy, stable relationship with a girl in another house. 
As for the bonding i’ve had with my friends, while it may be considered “artificial” in some way, it took me out of my comfort zone and has created what will be true, loyal, and lasting friendships. And that’s with all of the brothers in my house, not only a small group.
My fraternity has also instilled in me a great work ethic and taught me never to be complacent and always strive to be a better person.
Regarding the financial issues of going greek, I’m fortunate enough to have my parents pay for part of my dues, the other end of which I pay for myself. I have friends who take jobs and pay for the entire share of their dues, and others who have found ways to negotiate their dues to be more convenient for them. Money should NEVER be a reason to not join a house; some arrangement can always be figured out. 
With all of this said, the Greek community has a higher GPA than the collective USC student body AND we party harder than you. 
So please, don’t be bitter.
Bahaha, yeah, you guys go SO hard. I went to a few frat parties as a freshman before learning to avoid them like the plague and find the real fun. From what I can tell, they’re just a bland, watered down excuse for a good time. You guys don’t know the meaning of the word ‘party’…. so I guess the guys act sexually predatory to make  up for the boring vanilla-ness of it all. When I think of all the sexual assault that goes unreported/covered up, I feel so bad for the girls :(
Also, you guys whine about your poor reputation, but you bring it all upon yourselves. Oh yeah, and no one else cares about your garbage including the artificially inflated GPAs. You don’t have any relevance to the rest of us here, but I had to reply to this.
You could come up with all the bullshit stereotypes in the world, and spout them until the end of time, like I know you will, but don’t try to tell us we don’t know how to party.
If you partied in high school, you must have known how cool it would be in college to have your own house with tons of friends, a great ratio of guys to girls guaranteed, and an absurd amount money to use on parties (in relation to high school, there are also no noise complaints from the neighbors!). This recipe has held constant since the beginning of time, and in any context holds true.
I am only neglecting explaining the other innumerable benefits in this short comment for the sake of time. Actually, you know about them all – you just don’t know them at all.
It is hard for me to hold a grudge against a guy named “Kane” – I am sure you must have had it hard so far in life…You do understand most non-frat people treat Greeks like a buzzing fly – it only comes to mind when it is in front of you – otherwise you really do not give it a second thought. The only reason most non-frat ppl are even responding is that they ones we do run into – always end up being “that guy” who can only be described as having Spencer Pratt – level douchebaggery. Who is Spencer Pratt you say? Isn’t he a has-been for 4 years now? Exactly – that is what will happen to you boys after you graduate…
did this geed really not get the whole ‘kane liffin’ thing? and then try to mock the guy for his name? hahahhah
…nothing like a frat douche beating his chest and screaming there is a “hidden” joke when everyone is already in on  the joke. Thx for being that guy douche-bro-guy!!!
*skank row
LOL, FUN EXISTS OUTSIDE OF SKANK THE ROW?!? The mouth-breather who wrote this must be a freshman
for the record, I’m on my 5th year here (MA) and I’m sure I’ve had far more fun than any of these one-celled brain Greeks
Sorry Mike for all your shortcomings
RB, in a scant 3 years, you will be very ashamed you used the word “bro”. Sort of like feathering your hair in the 80’s and then having the incriminating photos haunt in later in the future. You sound like a colossal douchebag. I laugh knowing you reside in the chlamydia, gonorrhea, yeast-infected cesspool known as 28th St. Keep acting cool knowing the only friends you have are the ones you were forced to artificially bond with.
Sorry for partying bro!
RB – no need to be sorry for partying – in fact I want you to party harder! I want you to bang your way through all the sororities and then start with the fraternities (we all know you boys know the full meaning of Greeking…) After all the keg stands and beer bongs go find another frat bro that graduated 10 years prior and see if he will give you a job. I graduated a while ago and it is hilarious how you can always spot the office douche that was in a frat. Sort of a sad sight. He always ends up being “that guy” in the office.
That’s funny Ras – in all the companies I worked at and had internships at, including Apple and Disney, the fraternity men were the ones that had advanced their careers the fastest but I guess that could be “that guy”. But maybe you didn’t get the best job out of college – what with having no fraternity connection and an inability to recognize a play on words (FYI, the poster above Kane Liffin is making a play on Lane Kiffin, who happens to be the football coach of USC, his name probably isn’t Kane as you seemed to think above).
GDIs suck!
I’m sorry my family doesn’t make enough money for me to waste on your precious frat-star life that you seem to only know about.

Often in comic book adaptations, the filmmakers seem to have a need to humanize and overcomplicate a character to the point where the audience misses what made the character special in the first place. This ideal doomed the Sylvester Stallone version of Dredd, a film so bad it took Stallone more than a decade to recover.

Dredd 3D, however, sticks to the basics and delivers an unadulterated and concise action-thriller with plenty of violence and gore. Directed by Pete Travis and written by 28 Days Later scribe Alex Garland, the film corrects nearly everything that the 1995 Stallone version did wrong and stands on its own as an solid piece of entertainment.
The Judge Dredd character, originally designed by John Wager and Carlos Ezquerra, evolved from a satirical short story of America’s obsession with vigilantism into a three-decade-long sci-fi epic about fascism, class warfare and the ramifications of blind judgment.
The film adaptation takes place in a post-apocalyptic America in a gigantic metropolis called Mega-City One, where law enforcers act as judges, juries and executioners, able to deliver justice swiftly and without discretion.
Exemplifying this draconian method is Judge Joe Dredd, played by Karl Urban, who maintains a constant scowl and grizzled Clint Eastwood-like demeanor. In the spirit of the source material, the character represents justice and  law on a monomaniacal scale and never takes off his helmet or his uniform. He doesn’t behave this way out of joy or honor or even for personal reasons: He just believes, more than anything, that he is the law and that it’s his purpose in life to judge others.
Dredd partners up with a rookie judge named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who has a limited form of telekinesis. The two investigate a series of drug-related murders in a towering slum. Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a notorious drug lord, rules the slum and peddles SLO-MO, an experimental drug which manipulates a person’s perception of time.
When they arrest one of her lieutenants, Ma-Ma locks down the building, trapping Dredd and Anderson with  villanous thugs and residents out for their heads. One might be reminded of Die Hard or the recent foreign action film The Raid: Redemption, but it’s actually refreshing to see a comic book adaptation that doesn’t have to have an end-of-the-world plot device.
The script never glorifies Dredd’s questionable and arguably unheroic actions, and that’s ultimately the point of the character: He’s a man who takes no joy in what he does and ends up becoming strangely admirable in his near-fascist attitude.
The well-edited action sequences and tightness of the script keeps the film intense and zipping along nicely without dragging. The South African locations used in the film also adds an unique environment and the 3-D filmmaking, while a bit overboard, leads to some memorable sequences. That’s especially the case in scenes involving the drug SLO-MO, in which the film cranks up in frame rate and saturation to a candy-colored symphony of carnage.
It’s not a complex piece of filmmaking, however; the characters don’t evolve and there’s really no plot development. If anything, the fact that everything remains as bleak in the end as it does in the beginning seems intentional. Still, it doesn’t seem to hurt that Dredd 3D is very accessible to anyone who hasn’t read the comics.
But while this simple approach is appreciated, it’s a little disappointing that the more absurd details from the source material, like the cybernetic Angel Gang or the dimension-hopping Dark Judges, aren’t present. Dredd 3D features the gritty realism of District 9 more so than the gunmetal hyperbole of Warhammer 40,000, although in this case the approach works in keeping the film grounded and more appealing to people who have no idea who Dredd is or don’t remember Stallone struggling to say “I am the law” properly.
Dredd 3D is an amoral and bleak experience to the very end, but that’s why it works so well. It keeps to the spirit of the original Dredd character and doesn’t use a cheeky ironic approach. It never feels like the filmmakers are winking at the audience; Instead, they fully commit to the extreme form of justice that the judge dishes out — without questioning his method.

House at the End of the Street sure sounds like a typical horror movie title, the kind with a stereotypical dose of slasher killings and rowdy teenage antics.
Horror games · Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Elisabeth Shue star in House at the End of the Street. The two play a mother and daughter who have just moved to a haunted neighborhood in rural Pennsylvania. – | Photo courtesy of Relativity Media
 
But then something unexpected happens. Eerie opening credits drop viewers right into the middle of a brutal murder that sets the stage and pacing for the rest of the film. It soon becomes obvious that this is no ordinary horror picture; it is something much smarter and way more intense than its PG-13 rating lets on.
The plot seems simple enough. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Elissa, a 17-year-old student and songwriter who moves to rural Pennsylvania with her divorced mother, Sarah (Elisabeth Shue). They make for a highly attractive pair, so the film can check “eye candy” off its conventional horror to-do list.
Then the neighbors come in. They seem nice enough, and among them is Tyler (Nolan Gerard Funk), a high school jock who throws parties and thinks he can hook up with Elissa based on nothing more than his overinflated ego. Add another check onto that horror film to-do list.
It turns out, though, that this peaceful little neighborhood has a dark history, one that the neighbors believe brings down the values of their homes.
The story goes like this: A teenage girl by the name of Carrie Anne Jacobson murders both her parents in a violent rage and flees into the surrounding woods, where police say she died. The catch, however, is that they never found the body. Potential psychotic killer on the loose? Indiscernible rustling in the woods at night? Check and check. This film completes the horror to-do list in the first 15 minutes.
But viewers should not be fooled by the presence of these stereotypical conventions. House at the End of the Street swiftly takes expectations and flips them upside-down, taking the plot to unexpected and pulse-pounding territory.
The only Jacobson family member left is Carrie’s brother Ryan, who was living with his aunt in another location at the time of the murder. Now, however, Ryan has inexplicably chosen to live in the very house where his sister murdered their parents, hoping to fix it up and sell it one day.
Played masterfully by Max Thieriot, Ryan is good-looking, soft-spoken and quite understandably disturbed by what happened to his family. He comes across like a lost puppy, and Elissa can’t help but take him under her wing.
Lawrence and Thieriot capture the spirit of awkward young love with an undeniable chemistry that frightens Elissa’s mother into banning them from being alone together, an order which they, of course, they ignore.
Perhaps Sarah’s ban of their relationship is not the biggest hurdle they have to overcome, though. It turns out that Carrie Anne is not only alive and just as psychotic as ever, but Ryan happens to be holding her hostage in the basement of their house.
What follows is a tale with so many twists and turns that it’s almost hard to remember to take a breath. This exhilarating, unconventional narrative is not something that waits until the final minutes for a big reveal. Instead, it intricately weaves in more and more details as the horror of the situation unfolds.
Why is Carrie Anne so hostile? What are Ryan’s plans for her? Is Ryan just damaged from the trauma his sister caused, or is there something more sinister to it? These questions are the ones the film gradually answers to tie everything together for a knockout ending.
The cinematography is top-notch throughout, and director Mark Tonderai incorporates some interesting point-of-view camera angles in addition to swirling character close-ups that create an undeniable sense of dread as the film progresses.
All of this is not to say that the film doesn’t have flaws, but they mostly exist in regard to the secondary characters. Elissa’s friend Jillian is practically useless as a character, and a convoluted love story between Elissa’s mother and a cop ends up slowing the film down at random points when it should just be firing on all cylinders.
The horror genre has been suffering a noticeable drought in recent months, and there is no better way to fix it than with a film like this — one that defies typical conventions and brings something totally unexpected to the table. It is scary, suspenseful and mysterious; Alfred Hitchcock would be proud. It might have a generic title, but House at the End of the Street is just the surprise horror fans have been waiting for — whether they know it or not.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Thursday, Sept. 20, and Friday, Sept. 21. 
miscellaneous incidents
At 11:13 p.m. on Sept. 20, DPS officers responded to a report that an unidentified male grabbed a female student’s hands and began dancing at Birnkrant Residence Hall. The student went along with the gesture and danced with him. When the student got tired of dancing and stopped, the unidentified male grabbed her again to continue. The student pushed him away, and he grabbed her hands and arms to continue. The female pushed him away again and the male left.
At 3:38 a.m. on Sept. 20, DPS officers responded to a report of a student’s boyfriend pounding on her apartment door at Menlo Apartments and repeatedly calling her phone after she refused to allow him entry. The student declined to speak with the officers when they arrived at the scene and the boyfriend left the premises upon being asked to do so.
Crimes against property
At 6:43 P.m. on Sept. 20, DPS officers responded to a report that an unidentified suspect riding a bicycle grabbed a cell phone from a student while the student was talking on the phone at the intersection of Exposition Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.
I hate these stuck-up sorority girls who won’t dance with a guy that isn’t wearing letters.

With a new online voter registration system that launched last Wednesday, registration to vote in California is now only a click away.
In a state with 6.5 million eligible residents  who have not yet registered to vote, the 3,000 registrations in the first 12 hours of the system’s launch bodes well for a boost in turnout for the Nov. 6 presidential election.
The online system matches the information provided on the registration form with information pulled from the Department of Motor Vehicles database. Before, Californians were required to mail in signed forms to an official election office to be listed on the voter rolls, a process that takes several weeks.
Ange-Marie Hancock, an associate professor of political science and gender studies, said the new system should improve turnout.
“I do think that it will help a lot, especially for new voters — people who are just turning 18,” Hancock said.
Young voters historically turn out in smaller numbers, a fact that online registration seeks to change in the upcoming presidential elections. The perceived hassle of voter registration could be one of the reasons for this trend, according to Ann Crigler, a professor of political science.
“There are a number of reasons,” Crigler said. “[Young voters] don’t have the habit of it. They tend to move around more, and therefore, it’s harder for them to register. They haven’t done it before.”
Yet voter turnouts might not be the only factor affected by online registration. Voting representatives who work for a profit to recruit voters will also be impacted by the change.
“The positive effect will be on the groups that are more familiar with social media, but the more traditional groups that you see at Trader Joe’s will have a harder time with it,” Hancock said.
Many students, however, said they have not heard about the online registration system.
“They need to get the word out that it exists and that it’s an option in order for people to take advantage of it,” said Rachel Barton, a graduate student studying social work and a registered voter in California. “It needs to be publicized so people will do it.”
Some students, like Max Sherman, a registered voter and a freshman majoring in cinematic arts, voiced optimism about making registration more accessible.
“[It’s] hard to get to places where it’s easier to vote, so if you can register from your phone or wherever you are, it’s much easier,” Sherman said. “If you don’t have a car, [aren’t] familiar with public transportation, don’t have a lot of money or didn’t want to go around, busy all the time, doing it online is much easier than having to go to the post office to get the forms and do it.”
Just knowing that an online option was available encouraged some students like Alex Sleight, a graduate student studying occupational therapy, to register to vote.
“I’m actually going to check it out online,” Sleight said. “I’m not joking. Just the idea of having to fill out paperwork was super overwhelming.”
According to Hancock, past efforts to boost voter turnout for young voters have been successful when they were connected to something students already wanted. Hancock cited the Motor Voter Act of 1993, which asked individuals if they wanted to register to vote when they received their driver’s license, as an example.
“I’m not sure if online registration will be as successful because it’s not tied necessarily to something that young people already want, like the Motor Voter Act would tie to a driver’s license,” Hancock said.
Crigler said expanding registration is only the first step in increasing turnout. Registered voters still need to show up on Election Day.
“Any way that’s going to expand people’s opportunity to register should at least help them get through the first barrier, but it’s only the first barrier, because beyond that, they actually have to go out there and vote,” Crigler said. “There’s no guarantee that online registration will make the turnout increase.”
Oct. 22 marks the deadline for voter registration this year.

USC received praise in its efforts to close the achievement gap between white and minority students, specifically black and Latino students, according to a report released by The Education Trust last week.
Though graduation rates for black and Latino students hovered in the low 70th percentile in 2002, these groups now have a graduation rate of about 88 percent. The graduation rate for white students is 89 percent, according to data from College Results Online. Nationwide, the graduation rates for black and Latino students are 40.6 percent and 47.2 percent, respectively. The overall graduation rate for college students is 63.7 percent.
The report lauded USC for its efforts to close the achievement gap. USC has made a conscious effort to raise the graduation and retention rates of all students, including hiring a staff member specifically dedicated to the effort, according to USC News.
A USC report titled “Enhancing USC’s Quality and Diversity” notes that USC’s Academic Information Office gathers extensive data about the student body to create a “predictive model of academic success at USC.” The university then uses this information to target at-risk students in a proactive manner.
Jared Brow, a freshman majoring in international relations and global business, said USC’s effort to close the achievement gap should be used at other universities.
“USC is really becoming a leader in providing equal access to education,” Brow said. “The model USC is using will encourage other universities to follow in our path.”
Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning, wrote the leadership of top USC officials has been essential for the school’s achievement.
“[They were] successful in creating a culture of shared accountability for student success that starts with the student but then extends out to faculty, academic advisers and even to the staff who review degree profiles in the registrar’s office,” Harrington wrote in the report.
Some students said USC’s work to narrow the achievement gap is indicative of its commitment to academic achievement.
“This [report] shows something important about the school,” said Steffi Chen, a freshman majoring in biochemistry. “USC’s effort to close the achievement gap is just one of the ways in which it is aiding all its students to obtain academic success.”

Around noon on Friday, students, faculty and staff huddled on the rooftops of buildings to catch a glimpse of the retired space shuttle Endeavour’s last flight. The shuttle flew over Los Angeles as part of a statewide tour before it goes on permanent display at the California Science Center in Exposition Park, adjacent to the University Park Campus.

The shuttle flew up and down California atop a Boeing 747, eventually landing at Los Angeles International Airport. En route to the airport, the spacecraft flew over many popular California landmarks, from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Hollywood sign.
Many students said they saw the Endeavour as a symbol of unity and expression of human achievement.
“It was really cool to see that piece of history so close to home,” said Alex Bell, a senior majoring in film production. “It was one of the few things that we, as such a diverse nation, can be united about and celebrate. Every child looks up at the sky with desire and wonder, and it’s amazing that this piece of machinery has actually been in space and circled the earth thousands of times.”
Bell also said that the act of anticipating and watching Endeavour fly by proved to be a distinctly unifying experience for the USC student body.
“I’ve never seen so many people on USC’s rooftops, and it was fun to look around and see all these people sharing in the excitement,” Bell said.
Some students said the shuttle’s flight symbolized a rich piece of American history.
“I felt like this was one of those truly American moments, as it marked the end of an era,” said Julia Bonestroo, a senior majoring in political science and economics. “I know that NASA receiving government funding was controversial, but this provided good closure and it just got me excited to see so many people excited.”
For Gabriel Icaza, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering, Endeavour was fascinating from a purely technical point of view.
“Considering the machine can handle thousands and thousands of degrees of heat is amazing,” Icaza said. “We’re dying when the temperature reaches 100 degrees and this thing can withstand so much more and still fly into space.”
Though other students were unaware of why Endeavour flew by USC, they sensed the significance of the occasion.
“I honestly didn’t even know what it was for, but it’s a space shuttle so of course I would watch,” said Katherine Canfield, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering. “It was amazing, though, and it was really cool to see something that had actually been in space.”
Though Endeavour will never again fly through the air, it will make its way through the streets of Los Angeles from the airport to Exposition Park. The move is scheduled to begin Oct. 12 and will take approximately two days.

The targeted killing of U.S. ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens two weeks ago preceded a rise of intense violence in an already violence-ridden region. The spread of an anti-Islamic film, originally from the United States and translated into Arabic, has been pegged as the catalyst for Stevens’ death and the outbreak of violence that followed it. The Obama administration’s immediate condemnation of the film, however, was overzealous and could have dangerous implications for free speech in Middle Eastern countries striving for democracy.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Innocence of Muslims, was reportedly made by a Coptic Christian immigrant from Egypt named Nakoula Basseley Nakoula — working under the false name Sam Bacile — according to the Associated Press, although the details surrounding his identity are still hazy. The 14-minute film portrays the Islamic prophet Muhammad as a womanizer, pedophile and homosexual, because according to Nakoula, “Islam is a cancer.”
The Obama administration responded by condemning Nakoula’s film, even airing ads on Pakistani television that feature Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama denouncing the video.
But to blame the events of the last couple weeks on a film is to completely ignore the real issue at hand: the failed foreign policy strategy of the United States and its allies in the Middle East. In addition to trivializing the conflict and pushing aside substantial discussion about policy, the attention given by the Obama administration to Nakoula’s embarrassing film sends the wrong message to a region already struggling with the transition to democracy. Obama has simply added fuel to the fire, in the process essentially giving anti-democratic leaders in the Middle East justification for cracking down on speech and individual liberty — concepts without which there is no hope of establishing sustainable democracy in the region.
There is no question that this poor excuse for a film epitomizes ignorance, intolerance and stupidity. Muslims — whose religion prohibits the portrayal of the prophet — are outraged, and rightly so. “We never insult any prophet — not Moses, not Jesus — so why can’t we demand that Muhammad be respected?” an Egyptian textile worker named Khaled Ali told The New York Times. This criticism is a fair one, but that does not mean that a useless amateur film should be used as a scapegoat for the uncontrolled violence taking place in the Middle East.
Despite the trend toward democratization kickstarted by the Arab Spring in late 2010, censorship still pervades in the region. Most notably, leaders and religious groups desperately seeking to maintain power have cracked down on free expression in the name of combating anti-Islamic blasphemy. In Egypt, the election of former Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi has brought improvement, but even his leadership bears some resemblance to the nation’s authoritarian past. Just last month, an Egyptian court ordered that a Christian-owned newspaper, Al–Dustour, be confiscated because of allegations of anti-Morsi content and igniting sectarian conflict.
If the United States is truly to be an exemplar of liberal democracy for the world, reactions such as the Obama administration’s this month must not happen again. Its leaders must stand up for all speech and expression, regardless of whether said speech is positive or negative, respectful or offensive. Defending the continued presence of the film on the Internet in the inevitable legal battles that will follow could ultimately speak louder than the administration’s feeble initial response.
Freedom of expression remains absolutely fundamental to a working democracy and, ultimately, to political stability. With this in mind in the future, our leaders must defend it at all costs and turn their criticisms into sustainable solutions. If this does not happen, there is much less of a hope for peace or democracy in the Middle East in our lifetimes.
 
Sarah Cueva is a junior majoring in political science and Middle East studies.
The bottom line is that films like this are protected forms of expression in this country, regardless of anyone’s personal opinion on the matter.  The violent response by much of the Arab world remains unjustified, and one could certainly make the argument that the anti-American sentiment we’re seeing is as much an attack on America’s liberties, including freedom of speech and expression, as it is a response to the film itself.  In any event, American Muslims, and groups like CAIR (Counsel on American Islamic Relations) should focus greater attention on the reasons behind anti-Muslim sentiment (most notably Islamic terrorism)… rather than attempting to foster fragile peace by demonizing Americans who are genuinely disturbed by a pattern of behaviour associated with Muslims from around the world. Americans and others have legitimate concerns about what some refer to as Muslim “extremists” and others might consider Muslim “purists”.   Perhaps the question isn’t whether the film justifies the violence (which is certainly doesn’t)… but whether the violence justifies the film.
Also, I have to wonder why everyone (especially the media and America’s left) is so quick to condemn this film as outrageous and despicable, while simultaneously turning out in droves to see the play “The Book of Mormon”, lauding it as brilliant and engaging.  The irony is compelling, especially considering both represent artistic expressions on the topic of religion and faith.  Why is one horrible and unacceptable, while the other is wonderful and funny?
Jet, Please wake up, even the WH and his talking heads (Jay Carney) have admitted this was a terrorist attack. The administration was caught with their pants down and unprepared. To add insult to injury they buy ads on Pakistani TV as mentioned by Trojan Student above. 
Sarah, well written article indeed. But I do have to agree with Will. Unfortunately some Muslims do denigrate other religions. India had a well known Muslim artist, MF Hussein, who routinely painted pictures of Hindu goddesses in the nude in the name of artistic license. This would have been ok in the name of free speech if he had used the same artistic license to depict muslim figures in the same light – but he did not or should I say dared not?
This is an outstanding article, the fact that the Obama Administration has not only blamed the attacks on the video but have PURCHASED public service announcements in Pakistan apologizing for the video and free speech in our country is shameful and embarrassing. The administration is avoiding questions about the security of the consulate on and before 9/11 this year, it is simply unacceptable. Furthermore, the fact that President Obama is skipping his daily intelligence briefings is irresponsible, the administration is now claiming this a terrorist attack on American soil and the fact that it took them over a week to admit that is shameful. We should never be apologizing for our freedom of speech. 
The author is absolutely correct that the policies of the Obama Administration are failing, he cant even decide if Egypt is an ally or not. He goes into NYC today to do a fluffy interview with the view but he doesn’t have time to go to the UN and meet with world leaders? What is wrong with this picture? By not meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel this week during his visit to the US and referring to his concerns as “noise” is a sure way to not only ruin the relationship with that country but to bring on attacks geared towards America due to the ignorance and naiveté of our President and his administration. 
He is too busy campaigning to have even addressed the nation from the oval office about these attacks and clear up any misconceptions that his administration who is clearly having a hard time communicating has put out. The thing that is most upsetting is the fact that the media is too busy trying to get him re-elected and attacking Mitt Romney instead of focusing on the real issues that are facing our nations. Americans are being killed and peoples lives are in danger. I don’t know about all of you but I think that focusing on the source of these terrorist attacks is more important than blaming the death of Ambassador Stevens on a video and then moving on.
Ambassador Stevens was NOT IN the consulate when it was attacked – he WENT THERE during the attack.
Stevens died of SMOKE INHALATION while destroying secret documents (doing which was his purpose in going to the consulate in the first place). The possibility that he and his aides started the fire accidentally or deliberately to prevent the discovery and dissemination of the secrets should not be overlooked.
How is that a “targeted killing?”
Of course it is targeted when a mob of dumb cavemen decide to attack the US Embassy. The fact Ambassador Stevens went to his people’s aid – walking into danger is more a testament to him as a hero – not to the ugly mob not aiming at US targets. Has political correctness rotted out your entire brain?
This statement is false: “The spread of an anti-Islamic film, originally from the United States and translated into Arabic, has been pegged as the catalyst for Stevens’ death and the outbreak of violence that followed it.”
That statement is not false. The attacks in Libya were a display of terrorism, the Obama Administration (finally) has come to admit that.
…its okay though I like to watch NBC too when I want to ignore the real problems that are going on with the world and our country…
I like the overall direction of this article, but the author is clearly uninformed and quite naive on the subject.  The line she quotes from a random Egyptian “We never insult any prophet — not Moses, not Jesus — so why can’t we demand that Muhammad be respected?” and goes on to call a fair point is actually on the contrary a complete and utter lie that would be uncovered from just a few minutes of basic research. Publications throughout the Arab and Muslim world on a daily basis publish hate speech, including illustrations and cartoons, against Jews and Christians that would put Nazi propaganda depicting Jews as rats to shame. There are numerous watchdog organizations that observe and track these types of publications in the Muslim world. See this Anti-Defamation League page that shows the protrayal of Jews in the Arab media for just one example: http://www.adl.org/main_arab_world/arab_media_portrayal_jews.htm
More examples can be found here:
http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/ArabCartoons.htm
I would suggest the author does more research into this subject before taking such a statement at face value since this hits the heart of the problem- these protesters are not mad at someone for hate speech, they are mad that the hate speech was directed at THEIR prophet. If such speech is directed at Jews, or Christians, or Bahais, or any other group, then it is fine in their books. The author has completely missed this essential point. The concept of free speech is not the issue to these people- they have never known or understood free speech. All they know is that the speech that they don’t like shouldn’t be allowed, period. 
I agree with the author’s idea that our leadership should not put the blame on the film, but rather vigorously defend the right to free speech, including hate speech. However, how she makes the connection to the new leadership in the Arab world suppressing their people is somewhat of a mystery. Leaders like Morsi in Egypt are not censoring the people, but rather adding fuel to the fire and manufacturing outrage to solidify support and give the protesters the justification that they demand. Our problem in these countries is not that the new leaders are suppressing free speech, but rather that the free speech that is being allowed consists of ugly and radical ideas. We witnessed the so-called Arab Spring, and now we witness the more accurately named Arab Winter. The Muslim world is still hundreds of years behind the rest of the world, and we would be best to recognize this and protect ourselves

At this very moment, you could be using the Internet for something more productive than Facebook. As of last week, California allows state residents to register to vote online. This translates into easier access to the voting process for all Californians, but more importantly, it is a change rife with opportunity for the voting demographic that is arguably most connected to the online world: college students.
USC students who want to register to vote no longer need to visit the Student Government Office, pick up a voter registration form, fill it out and mail it in; registration is a click away. All you need to do is to visit the secretary of state’s website and fill out a registration form with your date of birth, the last four digits of your Social Security number and your driver’s license or ID card’s number. The system will search the Department of Motor Vehicles database to verify your information, and you sign off on it electronically.
The most tangible benefit of the online system is the direct potential for increased voter participation, something especially important in a state where more than a quarter of eligible voters are unregistered, according to the Los Angeles Times. Even more important is what it means for the college-age cohort — one that consistently has the lowest voter turnout of all age groups. In the last presidential election, which was touted as one for which students came out in droves, still fewer than half of college-aged voters cast ballots.
Whether the trend of college students’ low voter turnout is because of political apathy, distrust of the government or not having enough time to labor through a registration form, these numbers must change. The option of online registration in California makes this change a very real and feasible possibility.
Despite the appeal of time-saving convenience, online registration is not without its problems. Unlike other states with online voter registration, such as Arizona, California’s system does not ask for proof of citizenship. Critics of the online system worry that non-citizens will be more likely to attempt to cast ballots by registering online. But this is not a new concern unique to online voter registration; this problem has existed before in elections where voters registered on paper.
Moving registration online might, in fact, actually make the process more secure. Similar to the electronically verified signature on credit and debit cards, online registration allows the state to confirm voter information through expansive databases. Not only does this save time, but it also reduces cost. The Sacramento Bee reported in Arizona that every online registration saved the state 80 cents relative to paper registration. Considering California`s population of nearly 40 million people, California’s move online has the potential to provide a much-needed bolster to a state in financial crisis.
The Internet can and should be used as an active tool of democracy. College students, as children of the digital generation, should support it more than any other group. If you’re a California resident who is eligible to vote and you’re still unregistered, get online before the Oct. 22 deadline so you can make a change come November.
To register, visit the secretary of state’s website at www.sos.ca.gov.
