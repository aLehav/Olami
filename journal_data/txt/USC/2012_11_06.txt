After Saturday’s demoralizing loss to No. 3 Oregon at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, No. 19 USC felt it had a lot to work on in Tuesday’s practice. Though senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw two interceptions against Oregon, USC head coach Lane Kiffin still had much praise for his play this season.

“I thought Matt played great,” Kiffin said. “Oregon had given up 10 touchdown passes the entire season combined. Matt threw for five … Everything really for the most part is similar or better than last year outside of interceptions.”
Regarding Barkley’s higher interception total — he threw seven in 2011, Kiffin gave Barkley a goal of not throwing an interception over the next three games.
“It’s always a goal not to throw a pick,” Barkley said. “But I’m going to make more of an emphasis on finishing the season with no more picks.”
Though Oregon did generate some pressure against USC, the Ducks only sacked Barkley once. USC’s improvement along the offensive line can be attributed to the switch that was made at left tackle. Freshman offensive tackle Max Tuerk, who started the last two games against Arizona and Oregon, has been one of the keys for an improving USC offense.
“[Tuerk’s been] phenomenal,” Kiffin said. “You have to give the kid a ton of credit for what he’s been able to do.”
USC’s biggest problem in its loss to Oregon was its inability to stop the Ducks’ offense. USC allowed 730 yards on defense, and the 62 points allowed was the worst in school history.
“If you give up those numbers it has to be [defensive scheme and execution],” Kiffin said. “It really was a combination of every aspect of defense that you can think of for it to get to the level that it was at.”
USC waited until late in the fourth quarter to attempt an onside kick against Oregon, which had several people confused as to why Kiffin waited until so late in the game to do this. Kiffin defended the delay as a matter of field position.
“We kept having faith that we were going to stop them whether it was us making a play or them screwing up on a play as opposed to giving them the ball at midfield,” Kiffin said.
On a non-football related note, Tuesday was also election day. Kiffin declined to say whether or not he was going to vote in the election.
“I don’t answer political questions,” Kiffin said. “They’re a no-win [situation].”

When Lane Kiffin took over as head coach of the Oakland Raiders in 2007, he was 31. One of the stars of his defensive unit, defensive tackle Warren Sapp, was more than two years his senior.
Kiffin’s stint at Oakland was far from a success — the youngest head coach in NFL history crashed and burned through a 4-12 season that eventually ended a little while later in a bizarre war of words with owner Al Davis. He quickly recovered, signing on with the University of Tennessee to become the youngest Football Bowl Subdivision head coach in the country before controversially leaving that post for USC.
Now Kiffin is 37 and about three-fourths of the way through his third season with USC. The Trojans have woefully underperformed based on preseason expectations, which launched them to the No. 1 spot in the Associated Press top 25 poll.
As is the case with any struggling high-profile organization, the calls for Kiffin’s dismissal have already begun. Sports Illustrated’s Pete Thamel was particularly harsh toward the team’s failures of late, saying, “At Lane Kiffin’s two previous coaching stops, the Oakland Raiders and Tennessee Volunteers, Kiffin baffled everyone by somehow landing better jobs despite not accomplishing much. With a team in shambles, his father looking overmatched and his quarterback failing to live up to expectations, it’s unlikely that Kiffin will fail upwards again.”
Thamel certainly has a point, that Kiffin deserves a large portion of the blame for USC’s woes. Ultimately, though, he should not be fired.
Kiffin is this football team’s most important prospect — a mix of youth and smarts that, down the road, could help result in some serious accolades for the university. As strange as it might sound, Kiffin, like many of the collegiate athletes he oversees, has yet to reach his potential.
Lane Kiffin was 15 years old when Matt Barkley was born. I’ve tried to keep this in the back of my mind when the coach does something immature — namely the infamous recruiting accusations made against then-Florida coach Urban Meyer, the petty lies he told about his preseason coaches’ poll vote and most recently, his decision to switch Cody Kessler and Kyle Negrete’s jerseys just to attempt a silly two-point conversion.
Though Kiffin has yet to work out the kinks with his conduct, his coaching experience is anything but lacking. Almost immediately after his playing days ended at Fresno State in 1996, the future USC coach transitioned to the sidelines. He’s remained there ever since — a 37 year old with 16 years of coaching experience.
It’s an important distinction to make, as Kiffin’s maturity has cost him in the eyes of his peers. But he’s been coaching longer than several of those peers — some of whom are old enough to be his father — and he’s got plenty of time to put the pieces together to make sure the quality of play on the field matches the talent on paper.
I get the criticisms of the argument I just laid out. If Kiffin is experienced, why does he get the benefit of the doubt for being young? What has he shown over the last three years that points to future national titles?
Foremost, Kiffin has masterfully guided USC through the crippling NCAA sanctions that threatened to tear the football program down. The Trojans’ roster lacks depth, but is still constructed to take a few blows.
That’s not going to change anytime soon. With Kiffin leading the way, USC has the best recruiting class in the country coming to Los Angeles in 2013, according to Rivals.com. So fans and pundits thinking Kiffin is a bad coach appears to be irrelevant to the most talented high school football players in the nation.
Others point to Kiffin’s time here and argue that he has just one signature win — USC’s 38-35 victory at Oregon last season.
True, the Trojans have fallen in games they should’ve pulled out, including last year’s triple-overtime loss to Stanford and all three defeats this season. Improvement in that department needs to be seen, and sooner rather than later. I’m just not ready to pull the plug at the first sign of trouble, which in truth has come in 2012. USC was an average 8-5 football team no matter who coached them in 2010. You could argue the Trojans’ overachieved without any bowl hopes last year. This year has been a disappointment, sure, but is it really worth scrapping everything USC has put in place?
It’s important to remember that youthful coaches for big-time teams in the pro and college ranks are nothing new. Kiffin might have been a pioneer in the NFL, leading the Raiders while barely on the other side of 30, but there’s a track record of success for plenty of other young guys out there.
Three years ago, then-36 year old Mike Tomlin won a Super Bowl with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Last season, a barely 40 Erik Spoelstra was the leader of a Miami Heat squad that dismantled the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals. Of course, young coaches are by no means guaranteed to lead their teams to the promise land, as proven by Kiffin in Oakland and Raheem Morris for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But Kiffin isn’t some sort of test dummy for coaches in their mid-30s — he’s a genuinely talented coach who could pay dividends for the university.
As athletic director Pat Haden recently told the Los Angeles Times, “He’s definitely a work in progress. It can be challenging, but I think we’re making progress with Lane … I think he has a big future in front of him and a long runway.”
I agree. And I am hopeful that his plane will land on that runway sooner rather than later.

Let him get his training somewhere else. His ego is a big problem. The athletic dept. will not buy out his contract with at least two years left after this season. The defensive coaching staff needs an overhaul starting with his father while keeping only Ed Orgeron.

Just days before the men’s basketball season opener, the team’s starting backcourt has finally been established.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill announced after Monday’s practice that junior J.T. Terrell would start at shooting guard in Friday’s season opener against Coppin State, making him the only confirmed starter alongside senior point guard Jio Fontan.
Welcome addition · Junior J.T. Terrell earned the starting job at shooting guard, USC coach Kevin O’Neill announced Monday. He averaged 11.1 points per game at Wake Forest in 2010-2011. – Photo courtesy of Sports Information
“J.T. has made some great strides over the last seven to nine days,” O’Neill said. “He’s finally starting to play hard. He knows the game, and he’s very intelligent — more intelligent than I thought he was.”
Terrell, who played at Wake Forest two years ago, was the top-ranked junior college player last season after transferring to Peninsula College in Washington, where he averaged 24.4 points per game.
“I’m glad to be a part of the starting five,” Terrell said. “[But] it’s not really that big of a deal. I just gotta get in and play my minutes hard, whenever they are.”
Terrell started practicing with the Trojans in June and immediately started to develop an on-court rapport with Fontan.
“Ever since we started practicing, me and Jio have always been on the same team so we can kind of get a feel for each other,” Terrell said. “As of right now, I think me and Jio know each other’s game pretty well. Obviously it’s going to get better as the season goes on, and the more we play together.”
The pair is expected to provide a jolt to the team’s offense, which scored just 52.6 points per game last year.
Fontan, the team’s captain, averaged 10.5 points and 3.9 assists per game during the 2010-11 season before missing last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
“[Fontan] is just like your perfect point guard that you want to play with,” Terrell said. “He knows how to get everybody open, knows how to pick spots. He’s a pass-first guard even though he can score whenever need be.”
With Terrell starting, sophomore guard Byron Wesley will likely come off the bench after starting all 32 games and averaging 9.6 points for the Trojans last season.
However, with Wesley’s size (6-foot-5, 210 pounds), it’s possible he may slide over to small forward, where he spent some time for an undersized USC squad last season, to give the Trojans a swifter pace on offense.
“This year, we have so many athletic players,” Wesley said. “We can get out and push the ball in transition and get some easy baskets.”
The Trojans possess depth in the backcourt with freshmen guards Brendyn Taylor and Chass Bryan — a luxury the team didn’t have last season, when it was down to six scholarship players midway through conference play.
“When one good player goes out, we’re gonna have one more go in,” Wesley said. “We have great overall athleticism and quickness.”
Taylor and Bryan have both impressed their older teammates with their work ethic.
“They’re trying to do whatever they can in order to help the team out, and they’re doing a good job of that,” senior guard Greg Allen said. “They’re not worried about their playing time, they’re worried about trying to contribute to the team. That’s what we need.”
Allen was second on the team last season in three-pointers with 29 and is expected to fill a similar role as a sharpshooter off the bench this year.
Walk-on redshirt juniors Tyler Sugiyama and Daniel Munoz round out the Trojans’ deep set of guards.
In his debut for Wake Forest two years ago, Terrell set a school record for points in a first game when he scored 26 in the season opener against Stetson.
Fontan thinks his new running mate in the backcourt could be poised to post more impressive stat lines for the Trojans.
“[Terrell] is a playmaker,” Fontan said. “J.T. is one of the best one-on-one players in America, to me.”
But if Terrell or any other starters don’t pan out, O’Neill won’t be afraid to make a change.
“Hopefully guys understand that if they aren’t playing, they gotta do what they gotta do to play,” O’Neill said. “And if they are playing, they gotta take care of their business or they won’t be playing.”
Terrell doesn’t anticipate lack of effort being a problem.
“Practice is always competitive, whether you know who’s starting or not,” Terrell said. “We just got that type of team, where every day we step on the court it’s always competitive.”
Whether the Trojans can stay competitive with other teams remains to be seen — but with Fontan and Terrell anchoring USC’s backcourt, their chances look better than they did a year ago.

With the Expo Line up and running, it’s never been easier for USC students to explore Los Angeles and see for themselves all the city has to offer. Sometimes, even well-known and important places are overlooked because they’re just too far away.
Not anymore.
Past pleasures · Heritage Park has long displayed a series of Victorian-style homes that have been transported from other parts of Los Angeles. The latest addition to the park is a reconstructed pharmacy. – | Photo courtesy of Heritage Square Museum
Just a metro ride away in Highland Park is Heritage Square, which was recently named “Best Outdoor History Museum” by LA Weekly. The museum features 11 historic structures — eight houses, a barn, a train station and a church — that were constructed during Los Angeles’ Victorian Era and moved to the site during the 1960s to prevent them from being demolished.
To provide some background, the 1950s were a time of rapid expansion for Los Angeles. The freeway systems were allowing drivers to come and go (but mostly go) from the city, leaving the once-prominent area of Downtown to become an overlooked area susceptible to blight.
One course of action was to redevelop Bunker Hill by grading the area and building new, modern buildings to attract people to  Downtown. Unfortunately, this meant that the Victorian homes characteristic of the neighborhood were at risk. Students of L.A. history, architecture or urban form might remember photographs of Bunker Hill being constructed as Victorian homes were systematically torn down to make way for new tower construction.
Throughout the 1960s, concerned citizens worked to establish the Cultural Heritage Foundation, which would eventually organize Heritage Square as a last-ditch effort to save a sample of Bunker Hill’s Victorian structures. Now, the museum provides the opportunity to see this particular piece of L.A. history.
Los Angeles is home to many fantastic museums — LACMA, MOCA, the Grammy Museum, the Getty. Can Heritage Square join those ranks?
Sort of.
Instead of looking at artifacts in glass cages, this living history museum offers a spatial, interactive experience. Complete with guided tours with docents in period costumes, the museum works to transport visitors to the turn of the 20th century, specifically between 1850 and 1950.
One of the greatest criticisms of Heritage Square is its context. Most of the houses are visible from the 110 Freeway, which detracts from the immersive experience that the docent tries to create. Some architectural critics have called the museum an “architectural petting zoo,” since it’s a collection of homes removed from their original locations. While the homes weren’t originally neighbors, with the rapid development of Bunker Hill, how else would these structures have survived?
The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission, active at the time of Bunker Hill’s development, could only mark historic structures on a list, not save them. Now, the LA Conservancy lobbies for specific buildings and zoning ordinances to protect historic structures. Back then, redevelopment — and therefore progress — was the primary focus of city planners.
Heritage Square offers Angelenos a little bit of both. A reflection of what Los Angeles used to look like, progress in how the city deals with its past.
Where the museum falls short is with its latest project, a newly constructed pharmacy that breaks the characteristic moved-and-restored methodology. The pharmacy, in the works since last year, is a reconstruction of community mainstay George Simmons’ workplace that was built in the 1920s. Even with a donation from the Simmons family, the building’s attempt to disguise itself as an old structure is futile and only acts as a disappointment to visitors that are excited to see authentic Victorian Era structures.
From the Expo Line’s Expo Park/USC station, the trip takes approximately one hour. Heading toward Downtown, travelers have to make two metro connections. The first is at the end-of-the-line for the Expo Line at the Seventh Street/Metro Center station to either the Red or Purple Line heading to Union Station, and then the Gold Line to Heritage Square station. From there, it’s a short walk across Pasadena Avenue and north up Carlota Boulevard to safely cross the 110 Freeway on foot to Homer Street. The street ends at Heritage Square, so it can’t be missed.
On the way back to school, travelers can hop off the Red or Purple Line at Pershing Square and take a look at Bunker Hill today. Imagine if the Hale House or Palms Depot were still standing today at the top of Angel’s Flight: How differently would USC students experience the city?
Heritage Square is a beautiful place that is for sure.  If you want to learn more about Los Angeles history, read the book  “The Art Dockuments” by author Carlton Davis.  This a non-fiction book with a collection of stories about the Los Angeles art gallery in the 1980s, The Art Dock.  It is truly amazing!  http://artdock.net/
1880, you must be very old to know all this.
“Sguare” must be olde English for “Square”, right?
Heritage Sguare is like a petting zoo for old houses. It is not authentic since all the buildings have been relocated from somewhere else. 
USC students don’t have to go that far to see authenticity. USC was founded in 1880. Some of the houses in North University Park, just North of campus, are older than the University. Unfortunately, many of the students do not appreciate the treasure they have in their own front yard.

Twenty-three films, six faces and countless martinis (shaken not stirred) to its name: James Bond stands, without a doubt, the most iconic film legacy of our time.
Back Attack· Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in Skyfall. The film, receiving rave reviews, makes a convincing case for the endless franchise. – | Photo by Francois Duhamel, courtesy of Sony Pictures Publicity
The series has crossed generations, spanning a whopping 50 years. But it wasn’t always the cultural staple that it is today. A good film series needs time to build a reputation.
The films were originally inspired by the spy-mystery book series by Ian Fleming. And like most film franchises, James Bond began as a single film: 1962’s Dr. No, starring Sean Connery and directed by Terence Young. The film has proven to be tremendously successful — it has scored a 98 percent critical average on Rotten Tomatoes and was wildly successful at the box office — and launched a series, with 22 following films.
Since Connery, actors George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and most recently Daniel Craig have all given 007 a whirl.
Today, so many film franchises are dragged out past their due. Hollywood just can’t seem to leave a series alone, even if it has nothing left to offer, because they know a series is bankable on the merit of its name.
Over summer, we saw a fourth installation of the Bourne series. Following The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit hits theaters this December, with two more films to follow. The fifth, yes fifth, installation of Die Hard — A Good Day to Die Hard — comes out in February. Most recently, Disney bought out Lucasfilm, a deal in which George Lucas himself announced that he could make Star Wars films for the next 100 years — 100 years, really?
And, of course, Daniel Craig recently signed on for another two Bond films.
Clearly, Hollywood has a habit of dragging series out, squeezing every last bit of profit out of them.
From the industry perspective, it’s easy and smart to capitalize on something that’s a proven financial and cultural success. Films are huge investments that are risky enough as is. Filmmakers and studios invest millions into films that won’t prove their worth until completion.
From the viewers’ perspectives, however, it’s safe to say that many moviegoers would strongly prefer to see a new franchise rather than a tired one any day.
Studios need to realize there’s something to be said for a series that quits while it’s ahead. Why let it all go downhill?
But, then again, how are we to know when a film has nothing left to offer?
There’s no sure-fire indication of how much is too much, but it’s safe to say that a series should not continue unless there’s a story worth telling, one that will advance the series and engage audiences — think the Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings series. It would be easy to say that James Bond has gone on too long — we’re talking 23 films here — but that’s not the case. In fact, it’s thriving more than ever.
The series has gone through a roller coaster ride. Some films have fared far better than others —  Dr. No was a hit, and Octopussy a miss — but the series is constantly evolving. It changes its face, style and tone nearly every time it gets revamped.
In Craig’s turn as 007, the films have gone from great with Casino Royale to so-so with Quantum of Solace, and now — with Skyfall’s release on the horizon — the James Bond franchise appears to be on the upswing yet again.
Skyfall is being lauded by critics as one of the best Bond films yet.
“[Skyfall] conveys the melancholy of loss, mortality, and future-shock anxiety, while at the same time leaving us plenty of space to enjoy one of the most complexly unhinged villains in Bond history,” wrote Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly.
James Adams of The Globe and Mail puts it more bluntly.
“Suffice to say, Skyfall is one of the best Bonds in the 50-year history of moviedom’s most successful franchise,” Adams said.
And Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News believes the series to be as good as ever.
“Though a notch below Royale, Skyfall follows that reboot’s lead, making a now 50-year-old icon as cool as when he began,” Neumaier said.
If the critics serve as any indication, this doesn’t sound like a tired franchise.
If we had pushed James Bond out when it delivered earlier flops, we wouldn’t have seen the greats we have now.
It isn’t as simple to say that once a film falters, there’s no creative juice left. Sometimes, a series needs time to evolve. Creative teams need time to develop. Actors need to find their footing.
Continuing a series is acceptable provided there’s at least a good idea behind it. With James Bond, there have been plenty of good ideas throughout the series history, and because of its record as a mostly successful and incredibly iconic franchise, it’s one that’s worth continuing.
Does this mean all film franchises should continue in case a new, good idea could evolve? Please, God, no. If that were the case, we would easily be on Transformers 13, or worse.
James Bond is more than a series; it’s a legacy and we can at the very least afford it two more films to see where Bond takes us next. Who knows, the filmmakers might have more tricks up their sleeves, and I don’t think anyone can really object to a little more Craig.

Red Barn, a new musical by the Independent Shakespeare Company, is nothing short of magnificent.
Don’t let the low-budget appearance of the set fool you — there is no part of this performance that feels amateur. The production’s all-white set serves as a pristine alternative to the traditional black box theater. The actors perform barefoot and hardly use any props. Overall, Red Barn is executed with a refreshing simplicity.
Cast over cash · Despite its low-budget set, Red Barn proves a worthy piece of entertainment. The play, based on a true story, entertains with stellar acting, strong vocal talent and original music composed by David Melville. – | Photo courtesy of Xavi Moreno
The plot, on the other hand, is wonderfully complex. Based on a true story, Red Barn follows the illicit affair between a mole catcher’s daughter and a wealthy gentleman in the small English village of Polstead in the 1820s. There’s murder, sex, pig stealing, heartbreak — and a circus. This story has it all, handling heavy themes with dark humor and a sharp sense of self-awareness.
David Melville, who wears many hats as co-founder of the company and the composer, lyricist, co-writer, guitarist and star of Red Barn, was born in England near Polstead, and grew up hearing the story of the doomed mole catcher’s daughter.
Melville provides stellar material in every arena of this musical. Regarding his acting, he portrays the shady ex-con Beauty Smith with a Tim Curry-esque zeal, growling through songs, joking about his rhyming lyrics and explaining that pigs are “financially remunerative things to steal — and very tasty.” Similarly irreverent dialogue overflows in the script and lyrics, providing the actors with content that they can run wild with — the team behind Red Barn seems to understand how enjoyable it is to watch actors have fun with their work.
Mary Guilliams plays Maria Marten, the mole catcher’s daughter, instilling every glance with an allure so intense it becomes almost disconcerting. All eyes are on her as she glides in and out of scenes with haunting grace; all of her reactions are compelling and natural. Guilliams is also an impressive singer, although her breathy style is atypical for a standard musical theatre ingenue. She powers through her songs with a retro, soprano flair more reminiscent of Zooey Deschanel or Norah Jones than Patti LuPone.
Guilliams’ fearless acting style swings into full force in the climactic Act I finale, but her real star moment comes in Act II with a stunning ballad called “Red Barn.”
But the highlight of this show is the original music. Composed by Melville, the songs sound as though they could be new singles by The Decemberists. Instead of beating the audience over the head with predictable melodies and rigid verse-chorus-verse-chorus structures, Melville’s work fits in nicely with the understated technical aspects of the play. The band consists of only guitars, bass and piano, many of which are played by actors who hop in and out of scenes to take up their instruments.
The music is by no means simplistic, though; many of the songs have complicated counterpoints and tough harmonies. The lofty lyrics combined with the acoustic arrangements yield a pleasant sound that fans of folk music will love, though it does seem like the inclusion of a drum set may have aided in building the tension in some numbers.
Another asset comes from the strong, versatile ensemble. These six actors are all endowed with tremendous vocal talent and broad acting ranges, allowing them to fill any necessary roles with apparent ease. The actors are at the top of their game in the silliest scenes, in which they parade around as a creepy carnival troupe and later as a group of prim little girls, complete with hair bows and a pillow fight.
Though this production is without much official choreography, the members of the ensemble all contribute exciting movement styles. In one song, they even provide some percussion by rhythmically clinking their teacups and spoons against one another. Another bold directorial choice keeps a few cast members sitting upstage at all times, watching scenes unfold downstage — perhaps meant to evoke the lack of privacy in life in a small village — and conveniently performing harmonies when necessary.
Before heading down to the Pantages and dropping hundreds of dollars for a chance to see Book of Mormon, consider Red Barn as a worthy (and cheaper) alternative. It might not have the expensive-looking company numbers nor giant set pieces that Book of Mormon does, but this performance provides an intimate entertainment experience that viewers will treasure.

President Barack Obama finished off a hard-fought race with a victory, becoming re-elected as the 44th President of the United States on Tuesday night.
As most major networks began calling the election around 8:20 p.m., hundreds of students keeping tabs on the results in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center erupted in screams and cheers.
Though the popular vote remains close, Obama took enough key states to make it nearly impossible for Republican challenger Mitt Romney to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
Obama won the battleground states of New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and was widely projected to win Wisconsin, making it highly unlikely that Romney could catch up.
Exit polls and most major networks also predicted that Obama would carry Ohio, taking 18 more key electoral college votes that Romney would have needed to win.
The president was also leading in Colorado, New Mexico, Florida and Virginia, as of 9 p.m.

One of the most admirable actions taken by USC for the local community has been keeping its campus open to local residents so it can serve as a community as well as a student space. USC’s open-campus policy is one that celebrates the coexistence of the university and its neighbors, in spite of enormous differences in wealth, background and demographics.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Last week’s shooting outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, however, raised widespread concern among students, parents and administrators that allowing outsiders to come and go as they please puts students in danger.
The university’s amendments to the policy, announced Tuesday in an email from President C. L. Max Nikias, however, are not the solution to violence. Moving closer to a closed campus will devastate USC’s relations with the community and would fail to address the real issues at play in last Wednesday’s shooting.
The security issue, for one, arose not from USC’s open campus, but from the university’s own failure to enforce its regulations regarding after-hours social events.
A policy adopted this year disallows any social event taking place on a school night that involves loud music, serves alcohol or goes past 10 p.m. Wednesday night’s “Freak or Greek” party did two out of three.
Attendance at on-campus parties is also supposed to be restricted to those who can show a valid USC or other college student ID; however “Freak or Greek” was promoted by L. A. Hype as open to anyone 18 years of age or older.
The crowds, chaos and substance use at late-night parties justify the restriction of attendance to USC students, who are easier to identify and who can be held accountable under a specific code of conduct.
But the hundreds of local residents who pass through our campus each day aren’t here to party; nor are they here to do harm. They are avid readers hoping to take advantage of a library far superior than what their municipality provides. They are school kids looking to practice skateboarding tricks or take a safe shortcut home late at night. They are canvassers hoping to move students to social change. They are struggling individuals and families collecting recyclables in order to make a little extra cash.
Do we, who have so much, really need to suddenly cut off all these resources? Would kicking out all of these individuals peacefully enjoying our campus really make a difference for our safety?
In fact, it could have the exact opposite effect.
The new restrictions to the open-campus policy are not as harsh as they could be, but further alienating local residents could lead to resentment of USC’s presence in the community, particularly in the wake of widespread community disappointment in the potential gentrifying effects of the plan to redevelop the University Village.
If students, faculty and staff of the university become unwelcome in the neighborhood, the risk of violent incidents will go up, not down. History abounds with examples where the demonization of an identified “other” has led to extreme and often violent hostility between groups, from Los Angeles gang rivalries that seemingly arise over nothing to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
Such animosity would not only jeopardize the safety of those in the USC community. It would also jeopardize their abilities to enjoy the surrounding area. ’SC students, for example, frequent stores, markets, Laundromats and restaurants owned and staffed by local residents.
What if hostility incurred by the exclusion of locals from campus made visiting these places a less pleasant experience? Would we see a drop in the number of student discounts or businesses that proudly sport a Trojan theme? Would students become even less likely to interact with their non-USC neighbors?
This would be a serious shame, as would losing the campus-community partnership the school has worked hard to cultivate for decades.
Though Nikias’ new policy of a closed campus after 9 p.m. doesn’t do as much damage as it could have, the consequences of alienating the community will still be reflected in miniature. Many locals still make use of the campus after dark and the sudden restriction because of an event which they had no control over is bound to sting a little. Social events might need reform, but by further building up the wall between campus and community, USC would do this university and the surrounding community a disservice.

Editor’s note: This is an alternate viewpoint to Tuesday’s article, “USC must reconsider open campus.”
It is also important to note that USC was here first. It did not insert itself into the surrounding neighborhood. The surrounding community grew around it. The real question is why USC, one of the areas largest property owners, allowed the once vibrant area to slide into poverty and neglect.
This is not accurate. The slide into poverty was not the fault of USC. It was the virtual gentrification of the area from the construction of the 10 and the 110, essentially isolating the area, among other demographic and labor changes. I suggest a course in LA History before spreading misinformation.
“once vibrant area to silde into poverty and neglet.”
 A bit of history: 1965 riots, 1992 riots, Hoover Redevelopment Project mid to late 1970s: By law a Redevelopment area must be declared legally “blighted” for a project to be declared. USC saw it as a chance to be the hidden hand behind redevelopment. It also expanded into the community North and East during this period, often picking up real estate at bargain prices.  USC made an oral pact with community activists and politicians not to expand West. This pact is still in effect. Redevelopment, with its threat of eminent domain, also discouraged private development. The rent control law of 1978 encouraged landlords to prefer students (since they move frequently) over other tenants. The establishment of the North University Park Specific Plan in 1983 slowed expansion North of campus but did not stop it altogether. USC did try to stop the SP from being enacted into ordinance.
All of these factors have contributed to the community we now have.
Nor do you have a fully accurate history. The entirety of the neighborhood shift is not the sole responsibility of USC, as you seem to insinuate. I suggest you pick up a book before continually throwing USC under the bus. There were many well-documented instances of neighborhood-centric problems throughout the region of “south central” that caused labor opportunities to vanish. Might I recommend The History of Forgetting?
Shortly after the construction of the freeway system the middle class began to flee to the suburbs. this happened in all large American cities. In Los Angeles what was called “South Central” was hit particularly hard with demographic changes. By the mid to late 1970s and with the advent of the Hoover redevelopment Project the USC administration made a pact with community activists, led by the pastor and congregation of St Mark’s Episcopal Church and with politicians of the time to not expand West of Vermont. As far as I know nothing is in writing but the pact is still being honored. USC owns nothing West of campus even though West of campus may be closer to the heart of campus.
North and East of campus is a different story. The D T does not permit the posting of a URL which would be the easiest way to access the information but if you are interested in North of campus go to your browser and type in “North University Park Specific Plan”
If you are interested in the U V makeover do the same and type in “USC Specific Plan”
It is always best to access first hand information rather than opinion and innuendo.
Even public parks have hours. This is least USC can do to protects our children.
“But the hundreds of local residents who pass through our campus each day aren’t here to party; nor are they here to do harm. They are avid readers hoping to take advantage of a library far superior than what their municipality provides. They are school kids looking to practice skateboarding tricks or take a safe shortcut home late at night. They are canvassers hoping to move students to social change. They are struggling individuals and families collecting recyclables in order to make a little extra cash.”
The groups you mentioned have no reason to be on campus  past 9 pm. Even those needing a safe shortcut are capable of walking the perimeter of campus. The article seems like a gross mischaracterization of what the policy is actually doing. This is a private campus and I refuse to be held hostage by the fear that stronger security policies might “sting” the local community’s access to some privileges.
The point of this article is that USC must maintain an open campus – and by and large it seems like it still is. I am not sure what the author of the opinion would like to see more being done to accommodate the community. Would you like to share your dorm room with the many homeless bums scavenging around the campus? If you would like to have the campus be even more open then the recent policy changes allow then I have a proposition. I do agree many of the members of community re not looking to cause trouble. If we allow PROFILING then I think we can have a more open campus policy. I think most intelligent, reasonable people can look at most people and make a snap decision whether they are trouble or not. If you are going to walk around with huge cholo, neck tattoos and a sour puss hard look, and you are not in the NBA, security will check for I’d and throw your ass out if you have no business. People who cry for making the campus more open are also the same liberal, naive idiots that want gangbangers to have as much access to our campus as the elderly citizen looking to read at the library or the neighborhood women who want to jog on the track in the morning. We look for the crazy anomalies and cry “slippery slope” when in reality and in all honesty, we practice profiling each minute of each day in our lives. That is why even though liberal LA loves poor people, they themselves, often do not live near them when possible.
Why is it so hard to understand for people that USC must do all it can to keep the gangs of its campus? I’m extremely happy with the new measures. Afterall, many nice living complexes, even in great areas are closed to the public and have guards at their entrances. Noone complains about that. We all know that SC is in the ghetto. It is bad enough that our students have to be afraid to walk the streets outside of campus they should at least be able to feel safe and secure on campus. You well know well that the shooting that happened on campus was a gang shooting. Had the victim not been able to enter campus [he even tweeted to all the homies when he entered SC campus “here comes the neighborhood” [referring to the Rollin 40s neighborhood crips of which he is a member].”This in turn brought his enemies to campus. USc must do all it possibly can to keep these people of campus because LAPD does not do anything to keep these people of the streets of South Central.
USC is not a public park.
Why don’t these same people go play basketball on the floor of the staples center whenever they want? Oh yea its Private Property.
Look, I’m all for looking out for the community and all, but some things must be said to crash this pity party. Namely, there’s a limit that needs to exist.
First off, I’m sorry – I must have missed the part where WE pay tuition to attend this school, not them. These measures are done with our interests in mind. If the locals can’t understand that we pay for this privilege and need to have some restrictions, well then that’s just tough s***. It disgusts me every time I see some local skateboarder on our campus doing tricks with cameras, making a scene if they fall by shouting, and running into people. Not to mention the disrespect for our property shown by grinding on it.
And what business do these individuals have after dark on our campus? Most libraries are closed. The one that’s open, Leavey, kicks non-USC people out at 10 anyway. Let’s not even bring up all the property theft emails sent out by the DPS alert system. Again, we pay for these materials with a hefty sum, so we get first dibs. No exceptions. And we are right to have the measure to guard entrances to residence halls. I don’t care about those that rummage for recyclables outside, but if you need to come into a residence hall to do it, you better believe you’re mistaken. I guess if you think it’s ok, I’ll just come to your house next time and rummage through – it’s a safety issue and also of respect for person and property. In fact, why did you choose to come here? I highly doubt it’s just for the community.
Let me reiterate: there is freedom. And then there is taking advantage of that freedom at the expense of others. And USC students are those “others” here. Those that don’t attend here need to learn that USC is to be respected if it is to provide for others. Those that label these new measures as profiling are just plain ignorant. It’s not race, etc. Are you a USC-authorized individual or not? That is, do you either pay or get paid to be here? If not, you don’t get in. Traddie’s checks ID’s: your license to see if you can drink and a USC-based ID. Now, we just do it for the campus itself at evening hours.
The individual with the gun clearly didn’t recognize where he was or have respect for life, as many USC students were put at risk. I don’t extrapolate by assuming he is from the surrounding area (he is from Inglewood), but a group of USC students alone greatly reduces the chances of violent crime. After all, as a student, you have a responsibility to act with respect for others and for USC, lest you get kicked out. Assign blame all you want (I certainly have), but not changing anything is just plain dumb.
Overall, you neglect to mention the good USC does for this suddenly ungrateful community, not to mention LA (largest private employer, anyone?). Non-USC people would know best to not bite one of the hands that feeds.
@Manny – in general, you have good comments.
@Ann – Starting off your response with “you are high” and ending with a commentary about “your son” is a bit odd.  (“Sarc on” tag missing?)
You are right on Manny! I agree with you 100%!
You are high. I was nearly run over by skateboarders–drunken teens on campus launching off VKC on move in day; I witnessed a fight between two bums over whose garbage can is was to plunder, both in the dead center of campus. i AM TIRED OF SEEING DEGENERATES ALL OVER CAMPUS. First and foremost USC is for its students. Let the new village be the neighborhoods playground–until of course gunshots destroy that as well. USC is not the neighborhood, if it were no paying students would attend. All you financial hardships can go protest somewhere else. I am tired of paying for the neighborhoods fun. This is a private university not public. There is a distinct difference. I would ask the neighborhood to show its support of USC by other means than blackmailing us for $20m dollars in order to build The Village. USC is not a government sponsored housing project. The paying students and parents demand security even if you do  not. Try Cal State Dominguez, I am sure you will find their crime rate equals ours, if that is the atmosphere you want to attend college in. I assure you it is not what I want for my son.

Our long national nightmare is over. The 2012 presidential campaign has ended.
Was the election the most divisive the United States has ever seen? No. Was it the one of most consequence? No. But it has been one of the most inane and depressing elections in recent decades.
This election was a sobering snapshot of American democracy. This isn’t to say that voting in the election wasn’t important. But in the seemingly endless buildup to Nov. 6, there was a serious failure — both from elected officials and from those responsible for keeping tabs on them — to do their jobs.
On one hand, there were Republican members of Congress swearing to block anything President Barack Obama pushed for in the name of keeping him from becoming more than a one-term president. That meant everything, including a jobs bill that never left the House of Representatives. Then, politicians opted for petty arguments blaming each other for stagnated job growth.
Not to mention the inane comments on the scale of severity in rape, the lies spread about where Obama was born or rumors that The Dark Knight Rises was actually an anti-Bain Capital film.
Yet, this inanity and misuse of power went underreported thanks to the media. Of course, not everyone in the media is bad. Dozens, if not hundreds of journalists have spent months covering the election, reporting on important events and fact-checking candidates. But there are also the big media entities like Fox News, CNN and others that tried to sway the election by pushing a “narrative” that would portray a neck and neck race, even until the end. Superficial stories got the big coverage, while discussions on actual issues were swept aside. Reporting and facts gave way to punditry.
Want proof? Look at the presidential debates. They were poorly handled by moderators who failed to reign in candidates and let them ignore questions, and in the actual debate as well as the media coverage afterward, important issues from financial reform to climate change were ignored. Voters were instead treated to hours of discussion on binders, bayonets and more.
And worst of all, there was no major fact-checking of the candidates’ plans or speeches. No one really went up on national platforms to call out lies from either side. This is why so many of these lies still persist. But even misinformed voters can still vote.
Unfortunately, there was a push to prevent Americans from voting, such as efforts to require identification in Pennsylvania. These were thankfully shot down, with officials saying it would help elect Romney. And on Election Day on Tuesday, there were a number of reports across swing states of machines altering votes or people trying to prevent others from casting ballots.
Misleading or blocking people from voting sounds like something out of an oppressive regime’s tactics, not something that campaigns or officials in the United States do. The fact that it happens today shows how much work this country still has to do to live up to its reputation as a land of freedom, democracy and tolerance.
Perhaps the saddest part is that the election cost more than $6 billion. That impressive sum of money could have gone toward education, fixing roads, loans to businesses and so forth. Instead it went to negative ads, propaganda, huge rallies and voter suppression.
Americans deserve better. Democracy, debate, a healthy discourse of the issues facing the country — all of these things are invaluable and must be encouraged. There isn’t a grand overarching conspiracy to prevent that from happening — there’s incompetence, gullibility and the influence of money. The year 2012 was a depressing look at how our system can be manipulated, willingly or not, to prevent an informed public from having its say.
But it’s done. So instead of spending time, money and effort on lying, manipulating and blocking constitutional rights, let’s focus on issues that matter. Let’s rebuild the East Coast after Hurricane Sandy. Let’s help Haiti recover from the hurricane and the earthquake that destroyed much of the country. Let’s send relief to the civilians in Syria being massacred in a civil war. Let’s do something constructive before this process starts again in 2016.

I echo your sentiments fully. The news media in far too many cases comes across instead as advocacy infotainment. Accuracy is considered far less important than the agenda being put forth, and the profit model is simplified when you merely have to reinforce the prejudices that serve your agenda. While Fox News does well in the ratings, studies have shown that their viewers are the least informed. Their use of the slogan “Fair and Balanced” is downright Orwellian. 
With all the crucial issues this country faces, imagine how easily the results of the presidential election could have been altered at any point over something mindlessly trivial. Supposedly the campaign process itself is meant determine who is qualified by who performs the campaign Kabuki dance sufficiently well to convince a majority of voters they are “more presidential.” Relentless spin and unlimited corporate cash have served to render even facts as intangibles.
Ronald Reagan famously said “Facts are stupid things” misquoting John Adams who said “Facts are stubborn things.” I fear we’ve reached the point where regretfully, facts are trivial or inconsequential things. When Adolph Hitler wrote of effective propaganda and asked rhetorically whether it should be directed at intellectuals or the masses, he basically said, don’t worry about the intellectuals, there aren’t enough of them to matter. In a democracy where power is bestowed/wielded by convincing 50%+1 of voters (at least those who are not prevented from voting by illegal and unscrupulous means and whose ballots are counted accurately – certainly not a given) to channel that power to your side, a win based on lies, distortions, and gaming the system is still a win.

Students from both sides of the aisle came together in a final match-up to take part in a phone-banking competition in the Annenberg East Lobby for the final day of the 2012 election.
The competition, sponsored by USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, aimed at motivating and encouraging voters to turn out on Election Day.
For USC College Democrats President Aaron Taxy, the goal of the competition was to encourage eligible and capable voters to cast their ballots.
“In the few precious days leading up to the election, now we transition to make sure that everyone who is committed to vote for the president has the opportunity to submit their ballot and make their vote count,” Taxy said. “We do this by calling them to remind them about Election Day, let them know where their polling place is and making sure that they have a ride to the polling place if they are unable to drive themselves.”
USC College Republicans President Maddy Lansky emphasized the impact that voters will not only have on the presidential election, but also on the localized ballot measures.
“What we’re hoping to accomplish today is just to call as many voters as we can in California — and also possibly Nevada — to remind them to get to the polls and vote,” Lansky said. “Especially in California, this is important because a lot of Republicans might not want to get out and vote because the state is most certainly going to Barack Obama. However, for the congressional candidates, for the state assembly candidates and for the California propositions, it is critical that they get out and cast their vote.”
Throughout the election cycle, both Democrat and Republican students have mobilized in an attempt to solidify support for their respective candidates among voters. According to College Republicans Membership Director Lisa Ebiner Gavit, in the final hours of the election, the focus has shifted from swing-states to more local voters.
“We have been doing a lot of phone-banking, both off campus and at the Republican victory office in Thousand Oaks to precinct walk and phone-bank for both Romney and for local candidates,” Gavit said. “We’ve been trying to impact the swing states, but now we’re just calling locally to get out the vote and make sure that people don’t forget to turn in their absentee ballots or show up to the polls.”
The USC College Democrats set a goal of making 5,000 calls this election, which, Students for Obama President Kaya Masler said, they are close to meeting.
“The reason that we want to make calls is because a call means more than any kind of online advertisement or any kind of ad on TV that people can see —  it’s personal,” Masler said. “We get to talk to voters about why we think this election is important to us and we get to have an honest conversation.”
To Masler, the grassroots efforts made by Americans across the country can have a profound effect on the outcome of the election.
“If [Obama] wins, it will be because thousands —  no, millions — of people got out and just out of the goodness of their hearts decided that they were going to spend 30 minutes making a call instead of making dinner — it just makes the hugest difference in the world,” Masler said.
Masler added: “They talk about this election being polarizing, but nothing has ever brought people together this way.”
I don’t really understand phone banking competition.

Axwell, Ingrosso and Angello, otherwise known as Swedish House Mafia, are calling it quits, as most people have heard by now. Since making the announcement, the trio released its second and final full-length album, titled Until Now on Oct. 22 with EMI Records. The group’s first album, called Until One, was released in 2010.
If you’re expecting entirely new tracks from the world famous trio, this is not the album for you. This “soundtrack,” as Swedish House Mafia calls it, is more of a collection of the group’s favorite songs. Taking inspiration from live mixes and a wide range of collaborative artists, the tracks are built upon existing songs and feature each artist as an individual for a good portion of the album. Though many fans might be disappointed with the lack of new material, the album is a solid comprehensive piece that flows well from one track to another.
The deluxe version of the album includes handpicked original tracks from Until One. The album’s hard-hitting beats are best heard on a sound system with proper bass, and many of the tracks are definitely club-ready.
The album heavily relies on mashups and collaborations with other artists’ works, from Steve Aoki, Dirty South and Ivan Gough to Coldplay, Florence + The Machine and Usher. All bring their own flavor to the tracks, and this adds diversity to the final album, which otherwise doesn’t look much different from what the group previously released.
The lyrics on the tracks take the listener on a journey, as the songs hit melodic notes that probe the emotional depths of its listeners. The wide appeal of hope and wonder about the unknown are common themes that take the listener on a ride through the peaks and valleys of each song, while still making the album easy to dance to, with plenty of punchy bass.
“Calling (Lose My Mind),” featuring Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic is a prime example, as Tedder sings, “Can we freeze karma and surrender our rights and wrongs / Can we just for a night let the stars decide where we belong.” The addition of Tedder’s vocals to the original, already-outstanding track, “Calling,” gives the revamped song more depth and meaning.
Many tracks also have a common thread of a feeling of hopefulness regarding love, a positive outlook and a wonder of the unknown. In “Calling,” the lyrics “I will find you / I will reach you / or I will lose my mind” also reflect this theme, as do the lyrics from the track “Don’t You Worry Child,” featuring John Martin.
Martin sings, “There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind / We ruled the world / Thought I’ll never lose her out of sight / We were so young, I think of her now and then / I still hear the songs reminding me of when.” There is a sense of sadness, yet hopefulness to the song, as the singer’s father assures him, “See heaven’s got a plan for you.”
The album’s entirety features dream-laden lyrics, heavy on fantasy and nostalgia, often tapping into the darker emotions of its listeners, then bringing them back up to feel as though, with music, everything is going to be alright.
By focusing on broad, universal topics, the trio achieves a level of relatability that touches a wide audience and ultimately led to the group’s mainstream appeal when it began releasing music. The meaning behind the song lyrics in general can often be interpreted in different ways depending on the listener’s perception, even more so in Swedish House Mafia’s songs because they cover broader themes. This, along with melodic delivery, rounds out the sound of the varied parts of each song. There are mellow, melodic segments that ramp up to a harder-hitting bass that uplifts the listener and makes him or her forget about the trivial matters of this world in favor of journeying to the dreamy world Swedish House Mafia has created. In other words, Until Now creates the perfect escape from everyday life.
Though the final album is a solid recording from the group, it feels incomplete without new additions to the group’s repertoire. It seems as though they had already finished producing new tracks, and thus opted to use existing songs to create remixes and mashups instead of creating fresh ones. The album gets kudos for its depth, variety and thematic concept, but new material would have been ideal for the final album, as fans would have undoubtedly liked to have one more set of new tracks by which to remember the iconic yet short-lived group.
Since their careers took off a few years ago, the members of Swedish House Mafia have become the poster children of mainstream progressive house music. On occasion, music fans crossing over into electronic music have tended to like Swedish House Mafia’s music before getting into other niche sub-genres.
The group’s popular dance music has carved its place into a wide range of parties, and its hits can be heard in dance clubs all over the world. The group hit a milestone when it sold out all the seats in Madison Square Garden in record time for a show in 2011.
Formed in 2008, the group has become one of the most recognizable house trios in the world, playing at top venues and sold-out shows globally. What started as a chance meeting between members became an international music sensation. As of July, however, the group announced via its website that it would no longer be making music together after its final tour, aptly named “One Last Tour.”
“We just decided that we reached a point where we didn’t know what the next move would be,” Angello told Rolling Stone magazine. “We’ve had (success) beyond our dreams and we’ve come very, very far.”
It is almost certain that each member will make the most of their solo time to work on their individual projects and passions. Angello has also previously stated that he plans on further developing his own label, Size Records, in the near future.
Fans have had many questions since hearing the unexpected news of the still-rising stars ending their careers as part of the legendary electronic music group. Are they trying to end at their peak? Or is it too early? Perhaps they will come out of retirement in a few years? Maybe they are doing this in part for the publicity and to capitalize on the jaw-dropping proportions of sales for their One Last Tour tickets.
The one thing that’s certain is that Swedish House Mafia will be missed, and though the group will cease to exist, its music and footprint on the electronic and mainstream music scene won’t fade away anytime soon, if at all. In the meantime, the trio leaves us with a new album to enjoy, and one last pair of L.A. concerts in March.

In response to last week’s Halloween shooting, President C.L. Max Nikias announced new campus safety measures Tuesday morning, including restricting access to campus from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and requiring anyone entering campus after-hours to show appropriate identification.
Several changes to event-planning policies went into effect immediately. The new policies include banning the use of outside event promoters for all social events, both on-campus and on The Row. All student event applications will also be subject to a higher level of review by Student Affairs, and Dept. of Public Safety officers are now responsible for checking IDs of anyone attending on-campus events.
Nikias also announced several policies that the university will begin implementing now, but will not go into full effect until classes resume after winter break. Access to the University Park campus will be restricted to students, faculty, staff and their guests between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. seven days a week, and anyone who wants to enter campus during those hours will be required to show identification to DPS officers. Anyone who wants to enter campus during the day on weekends could also be required to provide a valid form of ID.
Security personnel will also check identification of students entering residence halls on campus, and DPS will increase the number of their officers and yellow jacket ambassadors on and around campus. The university will also install more security cameras around the perimeter of campus and near entrances to campus.

Dear USC community,
The safety of USC students, faculty, and staff on campus is a top priority for me and for my leadership team.  Like you, I was unsettled and troubled by last week’s shooting.  While the situation was resolved quickly and without physical harm to students, faculty, or staff, an event such as this is a sobering reminder that we must work constantly to ensure the safety of our university community.  My administration has taken a number of steps over the last few years that have significantly improved the security of our campus and neighborhoods, but this incident made it clear that more must be done.
Let me begin by recounting what we believe led to this incident.  A student group held a Halloween party on campus and used a third-party promoter that advertised the event throughout Los Angeles, even though the event was open only to students with student IDs.  As a result, many non-students arrived on campus who were not admitted to the party.  I want to emphasize that the USC students who organized the party never intended for this situation to develop.  A disagreement took place between two non-students outside the event that led to the shooting.  This incident does not reflect our neighborhood safety, but instead was a case of the wrong people being drawn to campus by a promoter.  The measures I will describe are intended to prevent that circumstance from arising again.
Immediately following the incident, I directed USC’s leadership to conduct an expedited review of our campus security and event policies.  After consulting with students and community leaders, we agreed on some key changes that I would like to share with you.
Effective immediately, we are making a number of changes to our policies related to the planning, approval, and hosting of events.
The following additional measures to improve campus safety will start to roll out immediately and be fully implemented when classes resume after winter break, on January 14, 2013.  I emphasize in the strongest possible terms that we remain and always will be a campus that welcomes all our neighbors for recreation, entertainment, education, and the community programs that have made USC a proud University Park neighbor for 132 years.
These new policies and safety measures are important for the entire campus community, including our neighbors who spend a great deal of time on our campus.  Each of these actions builds on the extensive safety improvement efforts that we have undertaken over the past several years and that have resulted in a significant decrease in crime incidents in the surrounding neighborhood.
I feel very strongly that the safety and security of our entire campus community outweighs small inconveniences such as showing an ID when we enter the campus at night or on weekends.  I appreciate your support and cooperation as we strive to protect and enhance the remarkable campus life and environment that is so special to the USC community and our neighbors.
Sincerely,
C. L. Max Nikias
wow
:D about time..
Profiling starting at 9pm every night at USC.
Sounds like progress USC?
Be sure and VOTE today for someone who doesn’t promote profiling like USC!
If it keeps out ignoramuses like you, we’re all for it. Just because USC is in this neighborhood doesn’t mean you get 24/7 access to it. No one is entitled to be on our campus any time they want except students, who, by the way, PAY for it. If you’re gone, well, good riddance.
“Profiling?” Someone’s imagination is running a little wild. It’s checking ID’s. It’s just like Traddie’s: no ID, no entry. Simple. Why can’t you get that?
I hope you are joking! SC is not profiling! THE GANG BANGERS HAVE NO REASON TO COME ONTO CAMPUS – KEEP THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD!
Every time I step outside I am profiled.  You people will never understand.
Hey, the Row don’t deserve anything more than the BSA.   Once we have a Black Row, we can talk about loosening things up for the White Row!
Lastly, I have been out all day working the Get Out the Vote campaign!  If you haven’t voted please do so before the 8pm closing time.  Our president needs your vote!
Also, our kids and the schools need Prop 30!
Despite all you bigots and haters, Peace!
Thank you America!
“Use of outside event promoters will no longer be permitted for USC social events in university facilities or on Fraternity and Sorority Row.”
That’s absurd. Why should the Greek system be penalized for the actions of ghetto thugs? People don’t get shot at frat parties. Nikias is just using this as an excuse to crack down on the Greek system and further restrict SC’s social scene.
I knew it!  It was the Greeks that did it!  You guys are responsible for this happening.  I don’t know exactly how you are implicated in the now infamous “Halloween massacre” but you did something!
The Administration is not going far enough!  Shutdown the Frats now!  Only then will parents be comforted that the campus, the community and greater Los Angeles are no longer under a threat!
ID checks from MLK to Pico!  As a worried parent, I want this NOW!
How long has the campus existed within an urban core?  
It is 2012 and 20 years from the L.A. Riots and some 3rd-rate punk-, reprobate-, criminal brings the campus to its knees!  Seriously?  This event is what merits that the campus enter lock-down mode, enact a police-state  (welcome to the new stasi) and “a taser for you?!”
What’s next?  
Because there is always a next!  Laws-Policies-Procedures never get rolled-back; they never get rescinded.  They only grow and grow and grow (like a cancer).  But no, it is not politically expedient to limit power, is it?!  So what’s next…construction of a new USC jail coming to a corner-of-campus near you!
Seriously, hasn’t the US had enough of the growing encroachment on personal liberties?  Does USC have to model the Federal government in abuse of power  — everyone had better have ID on them at all time, or you will be thrust out onto the edges of the street, to be eaten alive by the wolves (sarc).
I know what should happen; let’s do this: ALL THE ADMINISTRATION and everyone living outside of the 90007 zip code should sell their homes and move into the area.  (1) You would feel all of the policies that you are creating, for yourself  (2) You would learn how bad or good the neighborhood actually is; therefore making informed policy changes (and just how many of the administration are in the area at 2am)  (3) You could look yourself in the mirror, knowing you are no-hypocrite.
A “police state”? You’re an idiot. They’re adding measures so non-USC students aren’t welcome at night on campus. Which they’re should not be unless they are given permission.
You’re the idiot: Use your imagination.  
There are many entry points to the campus.  So what is intended?  Are they going to lock-up vast areas of the campus, funnelling everyone into select entry-points?  And you must have ID!  Yes, you are the potential criminal until you prove yourself otherwise.  You are naive and ignorant and scared.
What level of staffing is needed to “enhance” the monitoring of the campus?  Restrictions on mobility and social life are certainly key attributes to a police state.  But don’t fret, I am not comparing USC to North Korea.  Rather I am highlighting “the direction of” increased authority to a “security apparatus”.  
Maybe USC is getting dumber?  Who was the guy that committed the shooting?  Oh, yeah, he was someone that works in security; someone with state-licensing; but these are the guys worthy of “controlling” your movement!  By going along, you are playing the role of the idiot, the useful-idiot: You are not a criminal (assumingly) but you are okay with ALL of the negative repercussions falling onto you!
“Naive, ignorant, and scared”? I was a student for four years and did just fine by being aware of my surroundings and not getting involved in shady business. Are you even a student? If not, what business do you have on private property at night? None. If you’re not, you don’t pay tuition. Therefore, you don’t deserve to feel the entitlement to enter the premises. It’s simple, and apparently, you just don’t understand. You know who the guy was who did the shooting? A non-USC individual. People blame our neighborhood, but he was from Inglewood. If I was still a student, I would have no problem with these mandates. If you aren’t affiliated with USC, you don’t deserve to be there any time you want. This is no different from any other privately owned institution.
And no one is saying they’re keeping out the “potential criminals” except you – some students have been involved in wrongdoing, no denying that. They’re keeping out people not authorized to be there. It’s USC’s property – it belongs to students that pay for the privilege of attending, and thus, they are allowed to make their own rules. Leavey Library, for instance, already kicks out non-students after 10 PM. If any of these measures offends you, who cares? I have no problem with the surrounding community, and the community can adopt USC as their school. However, it still doesn’t make you a member.
This party was intended to be for USC students. LA Hype expanded the scope, and look what it got us. And I laugh at the fact that you’re expanding to include “LAPD” in your username. These aren’t measures involving LAPD – it’s an internal matter, and that’s how Nikias is handling it. All this shows is your paranoia. There is no naivete here. Measures like some of these have been requested for years. Example: when people who don’t live in USC housing try to enter for whatever purpose, be it to collect recyclables or not, it should not be tolerated. You don’t live there, GTFO. How would you like it if I just walked into your place a) without your knowledge and/or b) without your permission?
Sorry I’m not sorry.
Without divulging my status (because I don’t want to know who you are), and from reading the expressions of who you claim to be, I can assure you that I have stronger, deeper and more significant ties than you; and as far as my permissibility on the campus, procedurally, the policy will have no impact on me, regardless of the hours that I am on campus, if need be.  So, FO.  Your comments are offensive to me.  Your arrogance is offensive to me.  The school that I cherish and its evolving (devolving) hypersensitivity is offensive to me.  (And it is sickening that is come to this.) 
My prior interest in commenting was not to make personal attacks but to explore the issues.  Unless you want to control the comments too?  Unless you would you like to check my papers before I voice my comments in this text, I think I have the right to extend the argument.
Since, you want to challenge the intelligence of others; what is your intelligence?  I mean: Can you answer questions?  What makes you think that new policies will change anything?  When has there been evidence that the policies proposed are reflective of past, negative events, thus potentially limiting said events?  What is the relevance of non-campus policing and how will that be impacted?  Is there a greater need for control on-campus or off-campus, respective the data?  If those who commit crime do not care about laws to begin with, what makes you think “procedures” will have an impact on their thinking?  And no doubt, there are “events” that happen all the time and at all-hours; why are these hours excluded?  When is more crime committed: in the evening hours, on campus, or off-campus and other hours?  What level of cost is justified?  How much cost should be expended for security?  How many “agents” (DPS, LAPD) should be employed to enact an appropriate level of security that makes you feel comfortable?  If approximating a closed campus is effective then why limit it there: and extend to erecting greater walls, absolute restrictions?  Why limit the prospective, new procedures to those periods?  What quantitative effect does it actually have?  Do you have any evidence to weight the proposed procedures as cost-efficient from just closing the campus, if having an open campus presents a threat?  Where are the lines?  Why do you approve certain lines (arbitrarily) and then react against others drawing alternate lines?  At least existing lines have historical precedence; do yours?  Or does your support of existing lines have any precedence or weight or merit; or is it just what you want; is it just your prejudices, fear, naivety, superstition evident?
I already said what status I have, and I’m not afraid of it. Perhaps your comments would compromise yours, so I’m not going to force you to give that up. What I do encourage yourself to do is question your disparaging: “a taser for you,” “the new stasi,” “USC is getting dumber.” You talk about my arrogance. How arrogant are you that you feel you can disparage my university? And if you call arrogance the feeling that one’s own property should be protected from others that need not involve themselves, then fine. I won’t hide from that, and I don’t care if you think that’s offensive. In order to avoid yourself becoming “arrogant” like me, I hope you are open to someone coming inside your house or some institution you subscribe to with their own intents at any hour, lest you look hypocritical. There’s freedom, and then there’s taking advantage of that freedom. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. In USC’s case, it’s a private institution just like many others with investments that need to be protected. No one just has a right to walk in whenever they feel like it. Even with just this in mind, these changes are logical.
You mention the Watts riots and how this small-scale (though not less tragic) event is the straw that broke the camel’s back. I’ve got news for you: times have changed, and danger still exists. It has even gotten more sophisticated. It’s one thing to call out beefed-up security measures, but what you’re doing is extrapolating by calling it a “police state.” What it’s doing is limiting the property to a group of people that have paid for it. If non-USC individuals weren’t there, would this have happened? You can look at all the statistics you want, but they’re meaningless – “there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” You can manipulate the statistics for anything you want, but that’s all they are: anything you want.
You ask what the cost of all this is. Well, if you desire fewer incidents and decide to lower risk to protect life and property, then it’s common sense. Do you have bars on your windows? If so, was the cost worth it? Additionally, if so, why put them there besides cost? It’s not just about the money. It’s what the cost provides: a heightened sense of security among students, faculty, staff, etc. who don’t care to share their campus (at certain hours of the day, mind you) with people who haven’t paid or been selected to be there.
You can call it nothing personal, but to simply disparage a university for reacting in the best interests of the students (yes, I said it – people have been wanting this for years) is rather pathetic. I don’t agree with your position, but nowhere have I tried to limit your argument. I’m calling you out on it.
My question above all is this: why should the details you request concern you? If they don’t impact your checkbook, student or not, what difference does it make? And you can claim to have significant ties all you want; omitting them doesn’t exactly boost your credibility in this issue over those that attend this university, and especially those that experienced the recent incident. All you’ve done is extrapolated to call USC a “police state” just because you don’t seem to like the measures, for whatever reason that might be. My guess is, like others, you equate this to profiling, which is BS. If you think that I am dealing in hypotheticals of the benefits of these changes, then what do you call what you’re doing with the potential costs and risks of them?
I’m not discouraging a debate over these. I am simply in support of action being taken, and, as a recent vocal critic of the failure to act quickly, I feel good about these changes. Just because these changes were made to make USC less accessible, which apparently, as you’ve stated, doesn’t even affect your status of entering at the particular hours during which the campus is closed, doesn’t make them “a police state.” If you have so many questions for me, I ask you one back: what do non-USC individuals (i.e. those that aren’t students, staff, or faculty) need to do so desperately at night on campus that they don’t need one of the members in parentheses for to accompany them?
If measures had been enacted to close the campus completely, then, yes, I think that would be an overreaction. But to enact these measures, which students are reacting to positively anyway, isn’t going overboard. I have been on the record stating the past incident was isolated. That doesn’t mean we can’t learn anything from it.
May I remind you that while USC shouldn’t alienate those that aren’t a part of it, those that aren’t should respect our property and person. USC, after all, thrives off precisely those. Sometimes, it’s necessary to look out for #1. There are more important things to protect than feelings.
I fell very unsafe and not assured if the president thinks that the measures he has taken will “….prevent that circumstance from arising again…” Also, how can he state that the shooting does not reflect the “neighborhood safety” when this shooting as well as the shootings in recent history all took place very close to the USC neighborhood. Can’t have it both ways and stop trying to draw retarded lines in the sand saying that USC is not in the ghettos. We need to stop walking on eggshells and call out these idiots when these incidents of violence occur. Otherwise USC and LA at large are being very complicit with these horrible acts of violence and thug culture.
*Places hand on Ras’s shoulder*
You feel very safe and not assured? Look Ras, take the silver spoon out of your mouth and hop off your mother’s lap. If you are an actual student, you know that even before this event happened USC increased it’s security measures by leaps and bounds compared to what it has been in the past. With all the time you spend behind this computer you should take some time to fact check. On the night of this occurrence there were only 15 DPS officers present, and most (if not all) were inside the party when the shooting happened. There are more officers patrolling bike lanes on Trousdale everyday than at this party which was attended by the masses.
It’s absurd to me how the “neighborhood” makes you feel unsafe when you specifically have probably never even experienced an unsafe situation. If you don’t go to USC, I’ll give you some homework. Check the statistics on the number of fights, thefts, and rapes that occur every weekend on the row to the amount of “thuggish,” “ghetto” acts committed by the community.
This is an unfortunate situation, but I refuse to continue to read these ignorant comments. I do agree that LA Hype should issue a statement, but by you making comments such as these provoke even greater measures to possibly ruin the college experience for current and future generations to come.
It is important that we all become cognizant of the various associations we place with groups of people. The members of the BSA are exceptional people and do not deserved to have the same negative stereotypes that are constantly perpetuated by media sources and “bold” bloggers. There is a sort of generalized skepticism of minorities that has been ingrained in our privileged American minds. As Trojans, you should understand that our reputation is under attack. We cannot rewrite history and I think we can all agree that moving forward, we need to work towards having a collective voice in how the new policies will be implemented. If you want your actual voice to be heard instead of the clicks on your keyboard help us all organize a town hall. Stop being emotional and reactive, and become proactive. If the classes haven’t taught you anything, here is your first lesson on how to lead. Your opinion matters (to some), but don’t have your words fall on deaf ears Rasy.
Class over..
saR,
How do you know I do not live in Compton and blacker then a Haitian off a boat? Are you assuming I am a whitey with a silver spoon in my mouth sitting on mommy’s lap? Does that mean YOU ARE PROFILING ME!?!?!?! :)  I thought Liberals like you are so against profiling – i guess your hypocrisy has made you blind that that fact.
If I pay 10’s of thousands of dollars to go to a university – guess what – yes I do feel I am privileged enough to be provided reasonable security. If I think an armed gangbanger should not be allowed onto campus and gun down 4 people because of a “disagreement” then call me an unreasonable racist but I believe I am in the right. 
I can not believe how far political correctness has poisoned your mind that basic common sense and values have all been surrendered for an opportunity to pretend you do not subscribe to the kind of profiling you employed on me when it comes to murdering gangbangers — precisely just because they happen to be black.
What is most pernicious about your kind of arguments is that you harbor all the same feelings I do deep inside – you are just not able to be honest about it in the open.
Was it really necessary for Nikias to state that the USC students involved in organizing the party never intended for the shooting to occur? I thought that was a parody until I realized he actually made that statement. I still have not heard USC or BSA make some reference to LA Hype, the other party responsible for organizing the fiasco. In fact we have not heard any words of remorse from LA Hype. This is the exact opposite of taking responsibility for oneself. This BTW is exactly the opposite of what an organization like BSA should be reinforcing. Is it any wonder in the black community, young black males father kids and walk away without taking any personal responsibility? I guess LA Hype can create a ghetto event that results in 4 people getting gunned down and neither USC nor BSA has the stones to call them out or compel LA Hype to make some public statement. Shame on you all.
I support these measures (particularly the banning of the third-party promoter involvement), although I have to scratch my head at the statement that “this incident does not reflect our neighborhood safety, but instead was a case of the wrong people being drawn to campus.” So where did those “wrong people” came from? Bet they weren’t from Brentwood. But kudos to the president for taking quick and decisive action to make positive changes.
The perpetrator was from Inglewood, more than 5 miles from USC.
The vast majority of the serious crimes committed around USC in past years were committed by people from far outside the community. The neighborhood is not the problem. The men charged with the murder of our two graduate students are not from the neighborhood. The robber who was shot by DPS shortly after that incident was from Compton (Compton is more than 12 miles from USC. USC is closer to UCLA than Compton). The man who stabbed a student in the fall of 2008 on Orchard St. was from out of town.
As an alum I do not like these changes. But they are necessary to satisfy the ignorant parents with no knowledge or understanding of the neighborhood who were complaining by the hundreds for changes, any changes.
I call BS on that. If the community is so marvelous, then why does the “first family” live out in Pasadena or wherever? Why is the USC house for its president not right there in the community? Pretending it’s not a dangerous area is a terrible disservice to the students there.
You call BS on what? The known identities of criminals in police custody or prison?
There’s a huge difference between wanting to live in a multi-million dollar mansion with a view of the ocean as Nikias does and avoiding a neighborhood because of its safety. Bring something of substance to the table or go on living with your ignorant prejudices.
gangs are everywhere in that area. those kids – victims and shooter – were all gang members. You all know that, don’t you?
The ‘Trojan Family’ which is touted so often by the administration, is larger than just “Students, Faculty, and Staff’.” Where do alumns fall under the new ID program? Many of us still hold Lyon Center memberships and Credit Union accounts. Will we be denied access to the gym/ ATMs after hours and on the weekends? If so, it doesn’t feel much like the ‘Family’ I remember being a part of, and certainly not worth the quarter-million dollars I spent to join it!
This is a travesty! One of the main selling points and reasons I went to USC was because of the open campus amongst a bustling city-life. The more ‘SC walls itself off from the community, the more hostile the environment becomes. Common-sense is the best defense and efforts should be focused on stopping the advertisement of campus events to the South-L.A. public, not establishing a walled-off fortress. Lets not forget that the criminals responsible for last weeks tragic events were technically INVITED to campus, whether by accident or not. If you attract criminals to campus, violence inevitably follows. 
As Trojans, we are certainly capable of using common-sense to keep our campus safe rather than resorting to over-bearing policing. Lets take our campus back – As TROJANS – and keep it safe and welcoming to the community as well as current, former, and, most importantly, future students!

Class of 2011
RW makes some considered points.    I have two additional points to offer:   (1)  On campus social activities should Not be advertised to the community at large; why take any chances attracting strangers?   (2)   The safety of the students is Paramount and the campus is Private, so why not say that Private property and those associated with the university, or with some legitimate purpose, can be allowed; and those who are not associated or without legitimate purpose can be asked to leave?
Personally, I still feel that President Nikias needs to address the time lag that occurred with the Trojan Alerts System. When I talked with Sargent Alex of DPS, he told me that there is no dedicated person who consistently mans the Trojan Alerts System station. I feel that this must change. We as members of the Trojan community are entitled to a quick system that alerts us to threats that compromise our safety.
[…] Nikias announces new security measures Several changes to event-planning policies went into effect immediately. The new policies include banning the use of outside event promoters for all social events, both on-campus and on The Row. All student event applications will also be subject to a … Read more on Daily Trojan Online […]
