He’s the perfect combination of Cody Kessler and Marcus Mariota. Like Kessler, he’s a standout student athlete at USC, he leads a prolific Trojan offense and he does not get the attention that he deserves in the national media. But like Mariota, he’s arguably the best player in his sport in all of college athletics; he can attack teams in more than one way; he leads a team that will factor prominently in the national championship discussion and he’s a proud Hawaiian.
He’s Micah Christenson, the starting setter for the Trojan men’s volleyball team. If you’re new to the Daily Trojan sports section and have never heard of him, this just goes to show that he doesn’t get the attention he deserves because he is arguably the best college volleyball player in the country.
Kessler has done a great job leading the USC football team the last two seasons. Playing the most important position for the most popular sports team on campus, Kessler is the face of Trojan athletics. He passed up a chance on entering the NFL draft and elected to return for his senior season; I’m beyond stoked to see him lead next year’s team. With this year’s star-studded recruiting class, some writers have already predicted that USC will finish the regular season in the Top 4 and make the playoff. Kessler is now even getting some of the national press that he deserves; some writers have him on their early Heisman watch-list for next season.
But with all due respect to both Kessler and the football team, I think Christenson is the best male athlete on campus. I think the football team will factor into the national championship conversation next year, but that’s not in the near future. Kessler could also very easily get an invitation to the Heisman ceremonies in New York come December, but he has a lot to prove until then.
Christenson, on the other hand, is already on that next level. Likewise, this year’s men’s volleyball team is factoring heavily in the national title discussion midway through the season. Given his talent level, the success of his team so far and his playing style, Christenson reminds me much more of Mariota.
My loyalty is undoubtedly to USC, but I couldn’t help but root for Mariota and the Ducks a little bit in this year’s first College Football Playoff. Regardless of Oregon’s conference affiliation, I simply loved watching Mariota play. He was so exciting to watch because of his dual-threat abilities. He was a prolific passer and runner, making him the perfect leader to run the Ducks’ high-powered spread/read-option offense. He was a very deserving Heisman Trophy winner as the definitively best player on one of the best teams in the country. But on top of all that, he was very humble all year and avoided any of the off-field issues that have plagued other star college athletes. Though the Ducks just couldn’t put it together against Ohio State in the national championship game, he still had one of the best seasons ever as a college football quarterback and I hope his skills translate over to the NFL.
Christenson’s similarity to Mariota is almost striking. As the setter, Christenson is essentially the quarterback of the volleyball team, distributing the ball to his teammates around the courts. Like Oregon’s trademark hurry-up style, the Trojan men’s volleyball team’s offense runs a similarly aggressive, up-tempo style. After someone makes the first pass, Christenson can read where the opposing team is positioned before attacking better than anyone else in the country can.
The team has made a point of not only spreading out different attacking options across the floor but also attacking openings quickly before defenses have a chance to move over blockers. The success that the team has enjoyed so far has hinged on Christenson’s ability to quickly and masterfully set.
Christenson really is the best in the business at what he does. Last year, he won the award for the top college volleyball setter in the country. He is also the setter for the U.S. national team.
The men’s volleyball team is a very legitimate national championship contender this year. The Trojans are currently ranked No. 2 in the nation behind only Loyola-Chicago, the defending national champions. The Trojans are currently in first place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference standings. In men’s volleyball, the MPSF is like the    Pac-12 and the SEC combined — clearly the best conference in the nation. The Trojans were undefeated through their first seven games this season but they suffered their first loss last week at Hawai’i.
The Trojans’ loss to Hawai’i was particularly heart-wrenching. The Trojans won the first two sets of the match but lost the next three. Instead of being mentally drained after such a brutal defeat, the Trojans came back the following match against Hawai’i and won in a thrilling five-set fashion.
It was a particularly exciting trip for Christenson because he grew up in Honolulu. The victory showed not only the mental strength of the team as a whole, but also that of Christenson, who must have been under pressure from playing in front of his friends, family and the home crowd. But similar to Mariota, also from Honolulu, Christenson seems unfazed by pressure or high expectations.
The Trojan still have a lot of volleyball to play before even thinking about the NCAA tournament, but there is no better player than Christenson in the country to be leading the team.
The Trojans play two matches at home against BYU, who finished first in the MPSF last year, this weekend. I would highly encourage any Trojan sports fan to make it out to at least one of those games. Not only will you get to see some great volleyball, but you’ll also witness who I think is USC’s finest student athlete practice his craft.

The No. 6 USC women’s golf team came close, but just missed the hole for first at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes, Calif. It was the team’s first match of the spring semester.
The Women of Troy went 4-over 288 (287-292-288) on the final round for a 15-over 867 finish, but it wasn’t enough to catch Baylor with an 11-over 863. No. 13 Arizona placed third with a 28-over 880.
The Women of Troy won this event last year with an 866. While they did place second, they played hard throughout the day and cut down a 10-stroke deficit to three by the end of the day, coming up just short of beating the Bears.   Freshman standout Amy Lee completed her debut collegiate match with a 2-under 211        (68-72-71) third-place finish. Only three-back from the individual winner Bronte Law, a sophomore at UCLA, Lee proved to be a promising asset for the Women of Troy on the course. On the final round, Lee golfed even on both the front and the back nine, having a birdie and bogey on each.
Along with Lee, sophomores Gabriella Then, Karen Chung, Elizabeth Doty and junior Kyung Kim all turned in good final rounds for USC.
Then had a 2-under 69 on the final day to place 10th with a 3-over 216 (73-74-69) to earn her second-best collegiate appearance. In her final round, Then had four birdies and went 2-under on the back nine.
Kim tied for 13th with a 6-over 219 (72-72-75). In each of her three matches this year, she has finished in the top 14. For her final day she was one-over on the front nine and had three birdies on the round. As a 2013 and 2014 All-American first team, she will be intergral to the team’s 2015 national title run. She will also be competing to become the first ever USC player to earn All-American first team honors three times.
Chung tied for 18th overall with a eight-over 221 (74-74-73). This was the fourth time this season that Chung placed in the top-20.
Both Doty and junior Victoria Morgan — playing individually — tied for 66th with a 19-over 232.
Morgan’s number was called three times last season, twice as a starter and finished 2014 with an average stroke of 76.
Missing on the course for the Women of Troy were senior Doris Chen and junior Annie Park. Chen and Park are the defending NCAA individual national champions, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Chen, who hails from Bradenton, Florida, is a three-time All-American, who is looking to build on her successes as a national champion and the 2012 Pac-12 individual champion with another title in her final season with the team.
In her three seasons at USC, Chen has finished outside the top 30 in only four collegiate events and has posted 10 career rounds in the 60s, as of the beginning of this season.
Even though they won the event last year, finishing second revealed that the Women of Troy could still find success with the young girls on the course for this year’s Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.
The Women of Troy have a bright season ahead of them. Lee, specifically, could follow in the footsteps of Park, as both women graduated high school a semester early and debuted their collegiate careers at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.
Other than the six players at the Northrop Grumman, junior Kim Santiago and junior So Young Hwang were out on the course at the Matador Invitational in Northridge. Santiago tied for second with an 11-over 227 (71-76-80) and Hwang tied for 10th with a 17-over 233 (75-76-82).
The Women of Troy will remain in California for their next match. The Women of Troy will next head down to Santa Ana Community College for the UC Irvine Invitational, which will take place Feb. 23-24.

The USC Arts Leadership program will partner with the League of American Orchestras to present the “Essentials of Orchestra Management” seminar in the summer of 2015. The League of American Orchestras initiated the partnership with Robert A. Cutietta, dean of the Thornton School of Music, because of the changing dynamic of orchestras in Los Angeles.
“Essentials” is an intensive two-week boot camp designed to develop future orchestra leaders through a hands-on curriculum that tackles real-world problems.
The curriculum for the program has a multidisciplinary platform organized around four content areas: artistic vitality, business and operational models, community engagement and leadership.
Brent Assink, San Francisco Symphony executive director, and Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, will continue to serve as seminar co-directors in consultation with USC’s own Kenneth Foster, director of ARTL.
This will be the first time the program will be held in Los Angeles. For the past 14 years, ARTL has been held in New York City.
Foster explained that the shift from the East Coast to the West Coast is positive because the West Coast’s development of orchestras is more relative to the orchestras all over the country.
“New York is in a way sort of too traditional,” Foster said.  “On the West Coast we’re quite a bit more engaged and because of the way the environment is changing all of the arts in the country, people need to find a new way of doing things.”
Elena Sloman, a senior majoring in oboe performance, also agreed that the location brought a different dynamic to the program.
“The culture is pretty different from the east coast to the west coast,” Sloman said.  “L.A. has a large center for pop music so it’s going to bring a different vibe to the orchestral music scene.”
Foster said the program focuses on four disciplinary areas to foster a sense of community in the program.
“Artistic vitality says there is artistic importance to a range of different programs and configurations, it’s not about are you the best orchestra but are you a vital engaged orchestra,” Foster said.  “The community piece is a huge part of that.”
The program will provide a mix of presentation, discussion and interactive role-plays and simulations, as well as the opportunity for participants to visit local orchestras, such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Participants will also have the opportunity to engage in individual discussions as well as career mentoring with faculty. Participants with fewer than three years of performing arts organization are eligible to apply, as are graduate students, musicians and people outside the industry interested in a career in orchestra management.
Students at the seminar were pleased to hear that the opportunity was extended to those who may not necessarily have the most experience.
“To get into the music industry it’s not who you know it’s who knows you, so by pairing up, that builds connections for newcomers to enter the industry,” said Scott Lau, a freshman majoring in music industry.
Participants of the program will be housed together at Cardinal Gardens and the Radisson at USC.
Sloman discussed how the residential aspects of the program will increase the retention of topics covered in the program.
“I think it might make it more intense for the participants because if they’re going home every day they kind of forget about the things they do maybe, so staying here, its 24/7, and you’re really involved in it,” Sloman said.
The deadline to apply for the program is April 14, and the program will run from July 7 to July 16.

The Dornsife Washington, D.C. program sent its first group of students to the nation’s capital to study and intern for the spring semester.
After going through an application process that included essay questions, recommendation letters and a formal interview, eighteen students were selected to participate in the program. All students are currently enrolled in three classes called, Espionage and Intelligence, Formulation of U.S. Foreign Policy and Managing New Global Challenge. Students can receive up to 4 units from their internship through the program.
Jeffrey Fields, USC alumnus and assistant professor of the practice of international relations, is the director of the spring 2015 Washington, D.C. program.
Fields first heard about the idea for the program from Steven Lamy, a professor of international relations and vice dean for academic programs.
“The main idea of this program is to take students interested in politics and policy and bring them to Washington where they can take classes and work, but the idea is to pull all those things together, the academic studies, the work and seeing practical politics come to life,” Fields said.
Students are required to participate in an internship which requires 20 to 30 hours of work per week. Though only international relations are currently offered, Fields anticipated offering classes in political science and economics in the future.
Every participant will be living together in apartments and will be taking the same three classes, each student has been assigned to a unique internship. Students are interning in many different sectors, ranging from think tanks on Capitol Hill to government agencies.
For example, Dan Morgan-Russell, a junior majoring in international relations and global economy, is working as a scholar intern under Diana Negroponte and Paul. D Williams at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
In addition to researching small, individual questions on topics such as the Cold War and Somalia, Morgan-Russell also is able to conduct his own research. Morgan-Russell applied to the program to figure out his plans following graduation.  Through his internship experience with a think tank, he said that he would like to work in the future with a non-governmental organization.
“I feel really fortunate to be in the first iteration of this program, and I’m really looking forward to hearing how it continues to grow in the years to come,” Morgan-Russell said. “I really think it’ll be a feather in the cap of the University of Southern California if we continue to nurture this program and give the opportunity to young scholars, like myself, access to the kinds of opportunities you can only find in our nation’s capital.”
Meanwhile, Kara Junttila, a sophomore majoring in international relations and political economy, is a research intern at the Henry L. Stimson Center.
Junttila helps research associates by conducting background research, drafting grant proposals and coordinating various events. She had the opportunity to write an op-ed with one of the co-founders of the Stimson Center that was published in Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol Hill. As a result of her time spent in D.C., Junttila plans on staying for the summer to see what’s it like working in the government sector.
“It’s such a good experience to get outside of L.A. and to see what there is to do professionally after school and to make sure you like what you’re studying,” Junttila said.
Riyana Chakraborty, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business), is a research assistant at the South Asia Center with the Atlantic Council.
Chakraborty performs intern duties such as planning events, but she also does research for acting director Bharath Gopalaswamy. Her current research focuses on Indian space security objectives and policy initiatives.
Chakraborty explained that her favorite part of the program is having the opportunity to listen to the guest lecturers who come in to talk to students. “Every single class is a class you can take at USC, but when you take it here, the professors are constantly bringing in outside speakers who are experts in their field here in D.C.,” Chakraborty said. “The material we’re learning comes to life when they come to speak to us and when they tell us about what it’s really like to be here, and that’s something that’s very different from sitting in a classroom in L.A.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated the students are enrolled in one class and are able to receive 16 units through their internship. They are actually enrolled in three classes and able to receive 4 units through their internship. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

On Tuesday, the USC Institute for Global Health invited TOMS Director of Social Innovation and Impact Shira Shafir to speak about the concept of the “One for One” business model, which vows to deliver a free pair of shoes to a child in need for every sale a business makes, as part of the organization’s “From Activism to Action” lecture series.
Shafir is a faculty member in the department of epidemiology at UCLA and has been at TOMS for the last 13 months.
The institute partnered with USC’s Marshall Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab to put on the event, which emphasized social entrepreneurship. To coincide with the lecture event, the Institute also presented the results of their USC Global Health case study competition.
Heather Wipfli, associate director  the Institute, opened up the event by recognizing the winners. This competition challenged students to tackle a critical global health issue, requiring them to come up with realistic and innovative solutions within five days that they were given a case.
Each team had to represent at least three USC schools, thus emphasizing a multi-disciplinary approach. The winning team of the competition incorporated local Cameroonian arts of song, dance, and storytelling to educate the community about sanitation, water quality and shoe-wearing.
As part of their reward, the team was invited to participate in The Emory Global Health Case Competition in Atlanta, Georgia.
Wipfli then spoke about social entrepreneurship and multi-disciplinary approaches within the philosophy of TOMS to segue into Shafir’s lecture.
She began her lecture by supplying the audience with some numbers that illuminate the history of TOMS, beginning with the company’s inception in 2006. Since then, TOMS has sold and hence given 35 million pairs of shoes in more than 70 countries with 100 different partners.
“It used to be that we go to these organizations and say, ‘Please consider implementing and integrating [these shoes] into your programs,’” Shafir said. “Now, we have programs and partners who are coming to us instead so we can choose the best partners to work with.”
Shafir also introduced the company’s “Giving Model,” which begins when consumers make a purchase. TOMS’s supply chain team will then work together with partners who are knowledgeable about needs of different countries to allocate where the shoes go. The company’s “giving” team will work with various resources to further distribution. There is also a fund called the “Last Mile Contribution” to support the costs of such processes, including the costs of freight, vehicle rentals, fuel, storage and labor to deliver the shoes to more remote locations.
Demonstrating her background in epidemiology, Shafir emphasized the importance of shoes in context of its significance in disease prevention. According to Shafir, the simple act of wearing shoes can help prevent diseases such as podoconiosis.
“If children wears shoes, it creates a physical barrier that prevents contact from the soil, and it decreases their risk for devastating diseases,” Shafir said. “If you provide a child with a pair of shoes, it can be a life transformative experience.”
In addition to the existing “One for One” program, which sells eye care and supplies water to areas in need, the company now also sells glasses and coffee. In addition, Shafir introduced the company’s newest “One for One” initiative — selling bags to consumers in order to support maternal and infant health and to tackle the issue of infant mortality.
When Shafir opened time for questions, she received various questions regarding how TOMS’s corporate component might harm the company’s role in giving, especially after the company sold a 50 percent stake to a private equity firm.
“That was critical in the conversation and was actually insured in the contract — that the giving [program] would be protected,” Shafir said. “And in terms of missions and values, those are already hardwired in company culture.”
Natalie Mata, a junior majoring in global health, commented on how impressed she was with TOM’s program.
“I didn’t know how expansive TOMS’s “One for One” program was,” Mata said. “I didn’t know they were getting involved in optical care and now maternal and child health. These initiatives are really awesome.”
[Correction: A previous version of this story misattributed the quote in the last paragraph. It was Natalie Mata, not Shira Shafir, who said the quote. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]

Stepping off the fourth-floor elevator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a visitor’s first encounter is a row of fluorescent neon signs that create intricate Arabic script. These signs are the beginning of a new exhibit, “Islamic Art Now: Contemporary Art of the Middle East.” With LACMA’s impressive permanent collection of traditional Islamic art which is one of the most extensive collections in the United States now on an extended tour, the exhibit of modern Middle Eastern art has opened in its place.
The exhibit is an effort to connect the past and present. Much of the art reflects the history and tradition of the Middle East, but parts of it incorporate modern artistic mediums to depict social or political commentary. The neon signs at the entrance set the tone for the theme; the first sign reads “God is Alive, He Shall Not Die,” the other simply reads “Allah” in Arabic, and has mirrors positioned behind to make it reflect endlessly — to portray the infinity of God. The focus on religion is common in traditional Islamic art. The display simultaneously relies on the beauty of traditional Arabic calligraphy and uses modern technology as well as a contemporary medium to ellicit a response.
The exhibit is definitely varied — photography, paintings, digital art, two video clips and even an Iranian tombstone are included. Additionally, the art comes from Muslim, Christian and Jewish artists from every corner of the Arab world. This diversity gives the exhibit its necessary sense of depth and complexity, and mirrors how the realities of life differ vastly between Middle Eastern countries.
Despite the varied media and diversity of the artists, the exhibit feels cohesive, because many of the pieces focus on women and their roles in modern Middle Eastern life. An aspect of the Middle East that is condensed and over-simplified by the West is that the women are oppressed and restricted from participation in daily life. The exhibit projects an image of Middle Eastern women as strong, powerful and complex, not to be reduced to a single stereotype. Some are shrouded by a veil, screen or Arabic letters, and others are naked and staring straight into the camera. These women compel viewers to recognize the nuances of the issue and the difficulty in completely overcoming it.
Iranian artist Abbas Kowsari clearly condemns the double standards often applied to women in Iran in his pieces from the series “Police Women Academy,” taken at the graduation ceremony of the first women in the Iranian police force. These photographs mimic action movie posters, featuring women completely covered by the hijab, rappelling up a wall. The obvious irony of the photographs is that it evokes a sense of progress while simultaneously depicting a continuation of conservative tradition. The policewomen have now essentially been rendered useless, and represent, to Kowsari, how distant progress truly is.
Other artists tell a different story. Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj’s piece “Gang of Kesh Part 2” shows five women in conservative Muslim dress, but in bold fabrics of polka dots, leopard print, and camouflage. The women are confident and powerful, seated on motorcycles, their demeanors not unlike those of characters from Sons of Anarchy. They are clearly not meek or fearful. Another piece shows an Iranian girl wearing contemporary ’70s-era clothes and superimposed over an early 20th-century carpet. It harkens back to the liberal rule of the Shah of Iran, when women were not required to wear a veil and were allowed to be photographed; it was a time of liberalism and the championing of Western ideals. Portraits like this challenge the Western notion of an almost-fetishized Middle Eastern woman as powerless and weak, and show that the women of Iran were at one time very Westernized.
Some of the art is politically charged. A tombstone from Iran marks the death of a purposefully nameless political dissident; an untitled photo collage by Naghmeh Ghassemlou shows the fragmentation and devastation of the country following the Persian Gulf War. Most strikingly, a 1978 photograph shows graffiti on a wall in Iran that reads, “Down With Communism,” and is painted over with dripping red spray paint. The paint looks like blood and foreshadows the violent 1979 revolution that would depose the Shah and signal the institution of the Islamist Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini.
This exhibit emphasizes that though Middle Eastern issues are complex, they are not impossible to overcome. It shows us the vibrant and diverse culture in the Arab states, and that the region is not notable merely for its artistic history; its artistic present is equally relevant. “Islamic Art Now” was not a quiet, personal experience; strangers freely discussed and debated the neon signs, video clips and more. The diversity of the art reflects the diversity of the Middle East, and the discussions that took place echoed the display’s purpose: to promote discourse about the contemporary Middle East and the art it offers.

There is a lot of controversy and hype surrounding the new movie, Fifty Shades of Grey, coming out this Valentine’s Day weekend. The novel it is based on was the fastest selling paperback of all time in the United Kingdom and immediately sparked controversy for its glorification of BDSM and rough sex. The film adaptation raises similar concerns, as no one truly knows how far the on-screen version will go when depicting the overtly graphic sexual encounters present in the novel.
With all this in mind, however, the filmmakers have done an incredible job thus far in marketing their movie to a broad audience, and the soundtrack has played an instrumental role. Featuring incredibly prominent artists and a generally slow atmospheric mood, the album is smooth, creating not the BDSM sex playlist everyone was expecting, but instead a compilation of sultry slow jams sure to inspire both love and lust this Valentine’s Day season.
Featuring tracks from Ellie Goulding, Beyoncé, The Weeknd and a slew of others, the soundtrack has already generated plenty of interest in anticipation of the movie’s release. There are new tracks as well as classics on the soundtrack, and even a few alternate versions of major hits, such as Beyoncé’s “Crazy In Love.” The covers are also notable, including AWOLNATION’s cover of the Bruce Springsteen classic “I’m On Fire” or the album opener “I Put A Spell On You,” originally by Nina Simone, performed here by Annie Lennox.
The first single released was The Weeknd’s “Earned It,” which instantly got fans fired up, as The Weeknd’s often overtly sexual style was expected to bring to life the imaginations of many future filmgoers. The track itself was actually a departure from expectations as well as from The Weeknd’s typical style. It was not the aggressive, dominating track expected of the Canadian songwriter, but instead a slow orchestral ballad with the chorus “I will care for you.” By no means does it underperform, but it does set the precedent for not only the album, but also the image of the whole film.
The marketing and seeming production of this film are based less on the hardcore BDSM that characterize the best-selling series, and focus more on creating a sultry and loving tone. This is reflected through the slow, sexy love ballads of the soundtrack as well as a Valentine’s Day release date targeting date night crowds. An example of this is the inclusion of The Rolling Stones’ “Beast Of Burden” on the soundtrack. This classic is an exercise in slow seduction, standing as a love rock ballad years after it was originally recorded, and appealing to an older crowd that might not have be too interested in the film.
Though the book series was widely known for its explicit content and housewife cult following, the movie is clearly attempting to appeal to a larger audience. Beyoncé is arguably one of the most influential musical artists today, and she has two songs on the album, both of which are sure to be classics. Aside from “Haunted” off her newest self-titled album, she reworked her hugely successful hit “Crazy In Love” into a slow, bare bones ballad that screams sex scene, and if Hollywood has any idea of what people want, there will be some friction when this song comes on in the theater.
Capping off the lyrical section of the album is an incredibly moving track by Skylar Grey, who is absolutely an artist worth watching. She has a strong vocal presence and has been featured on tracks with Nicki Minaj, David Guetta, TI and Eminem as far back as 2013. Her song “I Know You,” written for this movie, is probably my favorite on the soundtrack. It has a slow build and barely features any instrumentation beyond light violins. Grey’s voice carries the entire song from start to finish, and it never gets boring. Even though there are two songs from Beyoncé, two newly written songs from The Weeknd, and a cover of one of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs, Skylar Grey’s voice is the most mesmerizing and could captivate even the most cynical of listeners.
The final two songs on the soundtrack to Fifty Shades of Grey come from the legendary Danny Elfman. Throughout his career, the composer has been nominated for four Academy Awards, so it is a pleasure to hear his work on this film. The last two tracks are tense, driven pieces by Elfman entitled “Ana and Christian” and “Did That Hurt?” both of which give hints to their usage in the film. While everything is speculation at this point, there is no doubt that Elfman’s work will be featured heavily in the film, and these two pieces are a great showcase of the film’s mood.
The Fifty Shades of Grey Soundtrack is an odd choice for a review, but with  high profile artists, original works for the film and well-chosen classics, it is actually one of the better albums of 2015 so far. It might defy expectations, as the themes of the film evoke assumptions of rough, angry love songs, but the slow, melodic songs on this soundtrack are both tasteful and sexy, and will be incredibly helpful in getting viewers into theaters this Valentine’s Day.

The people of Los Angeles are stereotypically famous for their diet-conscious habits. While some may see these habits as a hinderance, they have led to innovation in the city’s food scene.
This innovation might be best exemplified by Kippy’s! Ice Cream Shop in Venice, California. This local creamery has no actual “cream” in their products. Instead, Kippy’s! serves organic coconut-based ice cream sweetened with raw honey. The sweet treat has a place in any diet, as it is free of dairy, soy, nuts and gluten.
Kippy’s! became a phenomenon after its Kippy’s! Ice Cream Cleanse was featured on Good Morning America.
Backed by scientific research on the benefits of consuming large amounts of saturated fats, the cleanse promises weight loss. According to the company’s website, fat absorption increases metabolic activity while aiding digestion and reducing inflammation. Coupled with the nutrients from the other superfood ingredients, those following the cleanse should expect health-boosting results.
If going on a full-blown ice cream binge makes you a bit queasy, try just a scoop at Kippy’s! The shop has a simplistic atmosphere accented with vibrant colors, reflective of its product. Customers can choose from one or two scoops and a variety of toppings. Though $4.50 for a scoop of ice cream might seem steep, each serving is so generous that some customers even ask for half of one.
This ice cream alternative is in no rut when it comes to flavors. From the basic yet flavorful Honey Coconut to Chocolate Cappuccino, there is something for everyone. All appear to make an equal impact, with no clear customer favorite according to employees.
One Venice local raved about the melted chocolate coating that hardens upon touching the ice cream.
“Every time I come here I have to get the cinnamon with the magic shell,” said customer Stacey Kurtz. “The experience just wouldn’t be the same without it.”
It sounds too good to be true. The company seems to tout itself as the perfect answer to ice cream cravings. While the ingredients are locally sourced and the product the product caters to many dietary restrictions this sweet treat is definitely not free of calories, sugar and fat.
One half cup of Truly Raw Coconut is 159 calories. These calories are comprised of nine grams of fat, 21 grams of carbohydrates and 18 grams of sugar. While this might be better than a 250-calorie half-cup of vanilla ice cream from Ben and Jerry’s, the sugar levels of both desserts are almost equal. Compared to Edy’s slow-churned coconut pineapple ice cream, which contains only 100 calories and 13 grams of sugar, the aforementioned options pale in regard to health.
Despite the considerable sugar content, Kippy’s! creations contain beneficial nutrients from superfood ingredients. While it might not be totally guilt-free, Kippy’s! is an ideal option for those looking for a healthier dessert.

In late January, tabloids across the Internet announced the four leads for Paul Feig’s reboot of Ghostbusters. As if a remake of the 1984 classic weren’t great enough, Feig’s Ghostbusters quartet features actresses Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. Yes, that’s right — all four leads are female.
Unfortunately, sexist scum reminded us why female-driven comedies are scarce. Bustle tackled the backlash with humor and grace but was unable to conceal the awful stench of deep-rooted misogyny. One Twitter user suggested that producers change the title to “LADY Ghostbusters” in order to avoid “irate ticket-buyers asking for refunds.” Another user lamented, “Ghostbusters is now a chick flick wtf.”  Even Donald Trump chimed in, exclaiming in a recent vlog post, “They’re remaking Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford. You can’t do that! And now they’re making Ghostbusters with only women. What’s going on?” Donald Trump might not be the best litmus test for the morality, but the number of people who share his sentiment is disconcerting.
Of course, the casting decision has also received a great deal of praise. Slate points out, “the casting, and largely positive reaction to it, is also yet another reminder of how far we’ve come from the dark days of 2007, when Christopher Hitchens managed to provoke an actual debate over whether women are funny.”
Progress has been made, but the battle for three-dimensional female representation continues. Just take a look at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. According to Huffington Post, AMPAS is 94 percent white and 77 percent male. Moreover, there has never been a single Asian-American or Latina recipient of the Best Actress Award. Granted, the lack of diverse representation is not entirely the Academy’s fault, but big-name moviemakers must keep their judges’ tastes in mind if they want a shot at an Oscar.
Whoever is to blame, it is no secret that there simply aren’t enough complex female roles out there. Possibly the most disturbing evidence for the lack of female representation in the industry comes from casting calls great and small. In recent years, several frustrated bloggers have shed light on the degrading nature of female casting breakdowns for those outside of the industry. BuzzFeed featured actor Katrina Day founder of the popular Tumblr blog, Lady Parts. Lady Parts showcases examples of sexist casting calls for the sake of “calling bullsh-t, cultivating selectivity, and fostering discussion.” Day posts “laughably bad” casting calls excerpted from prominent casting websites, including ActorsAccess, Backstage, Playbill and Craigslist, with the intent of transferring the “punchline” from “the women they refer to, to the bumbling, sexist nonsense they contain.” Two of the most degrading breakdowns included in the article read, “Ultimate fantasy woman of a sexually frustrated college graduate,” and, “The dream of any teenage boy, sexy yet wholesome, perfect physique, and always eager to please her man.” Day laments that “interesting, complex roles for women are far too scarce, period,” but she hopes that her blog will allow actors to “reflect on their own standards for what projects they interact with as actors.”
Yet, combating sexism in casting goes beyond an actor’s self-reflection. A Telegraph article discusses inappropriate casting breakdowns and the work of three prominent bloggers: Everyday Sexism founder Laura Bates, actor/blogger Briony Rawle and an anonymous actor/blogger going by the name Miss L. In discussing the problems of mass exploitation, Bates, Rawle and Miss L saw the problem stemming from the media’s misrepresentation of women, even though the majority of drama students are female. According to the article, “Rawles, L and Bates all suggested that tighter legislation and regulation was needed to stop the current level of exploitation,” but this does not change the fact that there are not enough three-dimensional female roles.
In short, the Ghostbusters casting decision set off alarm bells because Feig dared to deviate from the norm. Casting four female leads for a science-fiction comedy is a step in the right direction, and complex female roles do exist. Still, sexist stereotypes continue to inform casting, from non-union theatrical productions to award-winning blockbusters. Film and theater shape our consciousness in inexplicable ways and provide us with role models. We cannot truly eradicate sexism without addressing its grip on entertainment. We need more directors, screenwriters and producers who are willing to break tradition for the sake of social progress. So, “who ya gonna call?”

On the evening of Jan. 26, the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity at USC threw a party unofficially themed “Colonial Bros and Navajos.” While the theme was changed on the day of to “Colonial Bros and Western Hoes,” it did little to change the interpretation of the theme. Some partygoers donned Native American headdresses as their counterparts dressed in collared shirts and other related attire. While the party was held for the purpose of having fun, it was based on ideas of racism, misogyny and insensitivity.
Several layers of insensitivity are underscored in the theme Colonial Bros and Navajos. First, the idea of dressing up as Navajos, especially considering the Native American population that attends USC, is offensive in its own right. Just as the idea of painting one’s face black is inconceivable, dressing up as a Native American group should similarly be off-limits. What took it even further was the juxtaposition of this minority group with the colonials, a population that participated in the systematic mass murdering of Native American groups.
Fraternity leaders need to consider the implications when deciding on party themes. Additionally, the channels for approving parties need to be properly addressed to ensure standards are met.
There is a specific set of guidelines that fraternities follow to throw a party. A house is assigned a date and a meeting must be held seven days prior  to review party details including security, alcohol and other logistics. During that registration time, a house needs to present the theme for approval. According to Interfraternity Council President Jake Simon, Lambda Chi Alpha had presented a theme that was different from the one that was ultimately displayed at the actual party.
According to Simon, IFC had no awareness of the change until after an anonymous student reached out to complain about the party. Generally, in the event that a fraternity opts to change an aspect of its party, including the theme, the change must be submitted to IFC and the university. Lambda Chi Alpha on the other hand changed the theme of their party a couple days prior, without alerting either entity. Even the third theme change, “Colonial Bros and Western Hoes,” maintains strong undertones of racism and misogyny. On his own opinion about that particular theme, Simon said, “that is not the notion we want to put out there. That is not what we [IFC] are about.”
In response to the event, IFC has decided to conduct its own investigation in accordance with Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, as the party could possibly have violated IFC standards. In addition, the fraternity was instructed to contact its national office.
Responsibility to community standards falls short in an environment of peer pressure, as opinions of dissension are stifled. Moreover, a lack of oversight diminishes accountability. The investigation, though, will hopefully illuminate the need of community members to uphold community standards even on the individual level.
While the issue of insensitive party themes might fall into the area of freedom of speech, a protection from policy should not be interpreted as a green light. There should be less focus on celebrating differences and hate; a party need not be offensive to be enjoyable.
Considering how diverse USC is, with 67 percent of the population identifying with a race other than Caucasian, including 23 percent of students who are international, no student should be marginalized by hyperbolic stereotypes. That idea is counterintuitive to the mission of USC, and tactlessness encourages exclusion.
There should be no tolerance for intolerance, especially with regard to a choice in something as frivolous as a party theme. While there should be a space for the Greek system to continue throwing parties and creating social engagement, there should be no space for insensitivity.
Please explain how the title  “colonial bros and western hoes” has the slightest undertone of racism. Would the harmless theme of cowboys and Indians be too “insensitive” as well? You said Some partygoers donned “Native American headdresses as their counterparts dressed in collared shirts and other related attire.” Where do you get this information to make this claim? Were you physically inside the fraternity house that night participating in this “celebration of difference and hate?” Or did you receive this information from another anonymous source of yours? Also To state that wearing a headdress is comparable to “black facing” is absolutely absurd. Based of of your article you are insinuating If a little girl is inspired by the movie Pocahontas and chooses to wear a headdress and moccasins for Halloween they are being racist, and it is on the same level of racism as black facing. While on the topic of racism and insensitivity by stating in your article 67 percent of USC is a race other than Caucasian you suggest that Greek life and more specifically lambda chi as being all white. While stereotyping Greek life you Also associate colonials, the people who founded the United States of America, all as mass murders and savages. Insulting the people whom fought and died building a country that allows people like you to make such wild accusations and spit in the face of U.S.A’s founding fathers. That in its own right contains more racism, insensitivity, and stereotyping than your entire article. Their should be “community leaders”, as you suggested, to read your articles before releasing such insulting and insensitive story such as yours. In addition their should be channels for the approval of your write up to make sure that the standards of USC are met. Side note you being a supporter of the Rini Jordan campaign your article seems to conveniently include themes of their ideas and representations. Such as these “community leaders” and an increased regulation on the row “bill of rights” etc… Furthermore their should be “no tolerance for intolerance” especially with regard to an article such as this. While there should be space for articles that have meaning, thoughtfulness, and relevance. There should be no room for articles such as this that misrepresents USC and insults the fathers of U.S.A. 
It seems like we got a butthurt fratboy over here.
How hard is it to understand that another culture or race’s total lived experience, especially in this case, an experience that involves suffering, rape and bloodshed, isn’t yours to condense into a costume and wear to a party for fun and recreational purposes? Also, your defense of colonialism is laughable. Did you know that the Americas were to some extent built up and industrialized by the natives themselves, and the European colonists didn’t have to build from the ground up or chop down jungles with machetes just to get through? Or do you still believe that the Indians and colonists sat down to a nice and peaceful turkey dinner when they first met?
Final note- if you don’t see anything wrong with the title “Colonial Bros and Western Hoes” I’d be surprised if you haven’t been smacked in the face by a woman yet. The whole point of intersectionality on college campuses is so we can tackle misogyny, racism and classism etc. all in one. Or maybe we need to break it down into baby steps for you, bro.
Serena, you did not read my response thoroughly. I never said “colonial bros and western hoes” wasn’t offensive towards women. I was addressing in what way did that contain racism, but I have to as you said “break this down into baby steps for you”. Not all native Americans were the same, just like how not all colonists were the same. Some more associated with murder and bloodshed, and some more affiliated with peace and prosperity. You joke about thanksgiving that celebrated a time of this peace and friendship. And it did not happen immediately as you state.
It was after controversy and death that a small group of colonists and native Americans were able to achieve such a celebrated day. In addition Europeans did not come to a land that was already developed. It was very much in its primitive stage just as the Europeans were. Both groups were able to learn from each other exchanging ideas and techniques that facilitated farming, irrigation, or hunting. Absolutely nothing to do with “industrializing” as you say that occurred hundreds of years later. So please Serena read a little more in your elementary school text book so I don’t have to waste my time explaining this to you. Thank you

Jessica Burdzinksi | Daily Trojan
As I hopped on a bus for my next day trip, I ventured out of Florence in hopes of checking another experience off of my bucket list — Venice for Carnevale.
Each year, the celebration lasts about 10 days, starting in late January and continuing until the day before Ash Wednesday. Known for its intricate masks and elaborate costumes, during this time of the year the romantic streets of Venezia transform into a huge, non-stop party. With themes differing from year to year, I was ecstatic to discover that this year’s theme was a topic very dear to my heart: food. After driving through the countryside and snowy mountains of Italy for about three hours, we finally arrived in Venice, the awe-inspiring city that floats atop the water.

Wandering down the winding and crowded cobblestone streets on our way to the Rialto Bridge and St. Marks Square, we stopped in few Murano glass and mask shops until we found our perfect souvenirs of Carnevale. Every direction we looked, there were breathtaking views of antique buildings and beautiful canals with picturesque bridges.

After enjoying paninis in a quaint cafe in St Marks Square with a view of the Doge Palace, we stumbled upon a parade featuring Venetians dressed in typical Carnevale costumes from throughout the ages. Following a relaxing gondola ride down the Grand Canal, we started our journey back to the train station. The streets were filled with colorful paper confetti, people in decorated masks, and the smell of delicious sweets in the air.
One traditional Carnevale dessert I had to try before leaving was cenci, fried or baked rectangular dough with powered sugar sprinkled on top. Crunchy, delicate and sweet, each strip of cenci seemed to melt in my mouth with every bite. Cenci can be found at any pasticceria and can sometimes be referred to as crostoli or chiacchiere. To make this mouthwatering dessert at home, all you need to do is mix flour, eggs, sugar, butter and salt into a dough like consistency, roll out and cut into rectangular strips, and then fry them in oil until golden. Leave the fried pieces on paper towels to cool off and for the finishing touches, dust generously with powered sugar.

I hope you will be able to get a taste of this simple yet delicious Carnevale treat at home — be warned, they are very addicting.
XOXO,
Florentine Foodie

Philosophers have, for centuries, struggled to define truth. And so many theories and basic logical relationships rely on the basic assumption that something is true; namely, 2 + 1 = 3 because 2 indicates two things, 1 indicates one thing and 3 indicates three things. Whether that assumption is in line with reality is another question; number theorists assert that in mathematics, truth exists based on the form of a function. Namely, the beauty of mathematics is that if something follows the form v1 + v2 = v3 in a way that satisfies the function, it can be deemed as mathematically true.
Yet, 2+1 can only equal 3 if we as a society deem true that the symbol 2 denotes two distinct objects and the symbol 1 denotes one; the mathematical form of v1 + v2 = v3 requires a greater truth of v1, v2, and v3. It brings us back to our original question: can we ever really know the objective truth?
It’s easy to get bogged down in number theory and the definition of truth, but the point is that truth is subjective; something is true if we commonly agree that it is. So what about truths that come into existence? Gravity, for instance, existed before Isaac Newton deemed it to be a true phenomenon, yet no consensus existed on its truth. It is so often mind-boggling to think of our vast array of knowledge — not just as an individual, but also as a university and as a human race — as only microscopic in the scope of everything that is true.
It is this realization that humbles us and reminds us that we are very, very small in the grand scheme of existence. But it also reminds us that we constantly stand on the precipice of innovation and discovery.
One of the most beautiful things about undergraduate research is the ability to participate in the exploration of a new truth — whether in the natural sciences, social sciences or other fields of study. It’s a deeply underappreciated way to make some small contribution to the greater development of a subject, a university, and ultimately, the human race. It connects the individual to a community at large, contributing to the human process of slowly dismantling truth and rebuilding new ones.

USC’s Undergraduate Student Government politics can sometimes feel removed from the everyday lives of students. USG might send out the occasional survey or host a forum on a timely campus issue, but when it comes to the day-to-day, much of the work they do isn’t highly visible.
We, as the source of campus news, are perhaps particularly aware of USG’s impact on this university. Each week at Senate meetings, elected student officials fight for initiatives to improve students’ lives and to promote USC’s continuous evolution. What they fight for, however, is up to you, the student voter.
Election season serves as an important reminder that USG is more than just a campus organization. They are our representatives, and they are ours for the choosing.
Instead of endorsing a candidate for USG president, the Daily Trojan would like to encourage students to thoroughly examine each candidate’s platform, experience and values in order to make their own informed decision when it comes to voting. USG elections have a history of low voter turnout — though last year’s election saw a record amount of voters — and we hope that this special issue will help to promote more student involvement in university affairs.

I am a third-generation Trojan majoring in international relations. I currently serve as the senior advisor to the USG president on the executive cabinet of USG. I am also the editor in chief for the Southern California International Review, a global undergraduate international studies journal published biannually. As a member of USG for three years, I know the power USG Senate holds over creating legislation that impacts all undergraduates at USC. I want to represent the residential student constituency and work with students to enhance USC as a thriving diverse university.

Alec White — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
I am a junior studying political science from the Bay Area. I joined USC as a spring admit in January of 2013 and I have felt at home ever since. Since then, I have served as the President of the USC College Democrats and as an E-Board member for QUASA (Queer and Ally Student Assembly). As President of the USC College Democrats, I have worked to increase political awareness across campus. I also have coordinated events such as bringing anti-sexual assault advocate, Sandra Fluke to USC while coordinating with WSA and PSA. At the same time, I value bipartisanship and I have reached across the aisle to coordinate events with the College Republicans. On QUASA’s Eboard, I have increased the welcome back program for spring admits and transfers. Through these positions, I have experience working with diverse groups across campus. I am honored to ask for your vote for Residential Senate for 2015 so we can work for a stronger USC!

I was born in Huhehot, Inner Mongol and grew up in Beijing, China. To pursue a world-class education, I came to the Golden State to attend an American high school and take part in a host family program. From a timid boy that barely spoke any English and knew nobody in this country, I graduated from my high school as the most likely to brighten your day by my peers and won Mr. Oaks Christian High School with a comedy routine.  Going to new places and doing things that challenge the status quo is my second nature. I have always wanted to make USC a truly international institution, where any international student here is not just a number, but a person with adequate representation. Unfortunately, international students are underrepresented in student government and many other leadership positions. I want to work with both administration and students to close the representational gap for international students. My passion for improving USC goes beyond international students. I was a delegate on university affairs my freshman year and a senator aide this year. Both USG positions taught me how to work with administrations and other students to achieve our goals. As an RA, I also want to enhance students’ residential experiences by providing more dining options.

Dubbury: During my junior year of high school in Seattle, Washington, I discovered a video of the Trojan Marching Band performing their pregame show at the 2005 National Championship. During the time this video played on my computer screen, I got goose bumps. The pride, prestige, and legacy of the University of Southern California shone through. Now I am fortunate to be part of this tradition. I am majoring in music industry and triple minoring in finance, entrepreneurship, and jazz studies. I am also involved in a multitude of campus organizations and clubs. USC and the student body has been here for me every step of the way.  As residential senator, my goal is to be there for you every step of the way. I have put myself into numerous diverse leadership positions over the past 3 years, whether academic, extracurricular, artistic, or professional. My goal is to help you overcome your challenges while at USC, and make this university a place where every single student ascends towards their ambitions. We are a family after all, the Trojan Family. Let us rise together this coming school year. Fight on!
Giuseppe Robalino — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
Robalino: I am a junior at the USC Marshall School of Business concentrating in finance. My educational background includes studying politics at Harvard University’s Summer School Program and lately, risk management at the London School of Economics. I have an extensive background in finance, having interned for a private wealth manager and a hedge fund. I am also a contributor for an international investing and financial news site. My leadership roles involve having led a major Orange County political youth group and participating as a repeat guest panelist for the USC Unruh Institute of Politics. Early in my college career, I served as USG Delegate and currently am a member of the USC Student Alumni Society. Eric and I share synergies, so we are running as a team. To this team, I bring my personal pledge to improve the academic environment at USC — reforming the course selection process and further bolstering our educational excellence.

I am currently a freshman majoring in economics from Redondo Beach California. I am the Birnkrant Vice President, as well as a delegate in USG University Affairs. I am also a member of Phi Delta Theta. In high school, I was the sophomore and junior class president of a class with 600 students. As a senior, I was the student body president at a school with over 2,500 students. I believe that my leadership experience will help me succeed in the role of Greek senator at such a young age. I plan to use my experience to help collaborate with my peers as well has act on certain initiatives to make sure that I leave the Greek Row better than when I found it.

Chris Fong — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
I have been involved with Greek life since my freshman year, and consider joining a fraternity to be one of the best decisions I made in college. I grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, where fraternities and sororities are uncommon, and the notion of Greek life is tainted by its depiction in movies. It was not until I joined a fraternity myself that I discovered the value of a small community within a larger university setting. As treasurer of Phi Psi, I have learned to work with my peers on divisive issues and handle them in a sensitive and respectful way. Getting involved in one’s house is a great way to create lasting friendships and develop professional skills. These overlooked qualities of Greek life are what inspire me to represent the Greek contingent on campus. I want to ensure fraternities and sororities continue to be a constructive experience for USC students. However, houses can only maintain these qualities if students feel safe, comfortable and included in activities. As senator, I will work to create this type of environment so all USC students have the opportunity to enjoy the Greek experience.

I am a junior at USC, and I’m ecstatic to be running for USG Greek senator. Originally from San Clemente, California, I’m majoring in print and digital journalism with a double minor in business finance and accounting and aspire to one day make the leap into the sports representation industry. Ever since stepping onto USC’s campus two years ago as a spring admit freshman, I have gotten involved in many different facets of the school, including Undergraduate Student Government, serving as the assistant director of Wellness Affairs, where I have worked on projects such as Revamp Lyon.  I am currently the sports editor of the Daily Trojan, where you can read my weekly column, “Persian Persuasion.” Within the Greek community, I sit on the executive board of my fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, better known as FIJI, and am also the IFC Director of Safety and Risk Management. You can also catch me on Trojan’s Vision’s weekly sports talk show, The Water Cooler. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to work with the USC community and the rest of the Trojan family in order to take this university to new heights!

Cassie Aguayo — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
My name is Cassie Aguayo and I commute to USC from Long Beach, California. Last semester was my first semester here at USC after transferring from Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. Recently, I switched my major to international relations, and I am now working towards declaring a minor in business entrepreneurship. Before I started my college education, I was a tutor for elementary school kids in math and language arts. Now, I help out with my father’s small family business with my siblings doing secretarial work. Working alongside my tight-knit family has taught me the vitality of cooperation and teamwork, which I feel I can put into use as a part of the Undergraduate Student Government. Being a commuter, I strive to make my time on campus valuable, which is why I am especially passionate about taking on the responsibilities being a commuter senator would entail. Although I am often immersed in my schoolwork during the semester, I enjoy leisurely reading, hiking and spending time with close family and friends. I also like to hangout at local coffee shops and concerts in the greater Los Angeles area.

Bulk Lao — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
I was born in a Christian refugee camp in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. My parents were refugees from the Vietnam War, and we started in the United States with nothing. My family didn’t know what success was, and we struggled for a long time. I finally found myself here at USC, where many windows of opportunities are available to me. I am a rare spring admit. I was encouraged and supported by many wonderful administrators and faculty at my former junior college, East Los Angeles College. I wanted to do more for the entire campus so I moved on to student government and became a part of the Associated Student Union Family. I served as the vice president of finance where I revived the Lunar New Year Festival running alongside our Covered California Sign-up Campaign. The event provided the community with joy, happiness and good health. Students enjoyed the lion dance show and got started in the process of being medically covered. As of today, I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in business administration with a focus in accounting and management in the Marshall School of Business. I am currently working as a program assistant for ELAC Outreach, as well as a teacher’s assistant for the Joint Educational Project linking students with information and resources in their pursuit of student success. I am so grateful for all the opportunities that have been provided to me, and I want to pay it forward as your next commuter senator. I know that by working together and pooling our community resources together there is nothing that we cannot achieve together. We should feel empowered and I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for all of us.

 
 
Jacob Ellenhorn
Jacob Ellenhorn — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
Born and raised in Beverly Hills, CaIifornia, it has always been a dream of mine to attend USC. I have always believed strongly in getting involved and getting my hands dirty. When I came here I became very strongly involved in on-campus activities, especially with the College Republicans. I feel that too many candidates come to USG with the hopes of “changing the campus.” I am not running to change the campus, but to give a voice to my fellow commuters and conservative minded students. I feel that there needs to be someone on the body that will stand for common sense principles. As a senator, I will reject any and all proposed fee hikes. I believe that USG has been able to prosper on smaller budgets, and I believe it should. Resolutions to award $2,500 to groups for bike powered performance stages, and resolutions to fund giant inflatable vaginas are simply wasteful and unnecessary. As a senator, I will stand against such wasteful and extravagant budget allocations. Furthermore, I will promise to vote against any and all bills that attempt to boycott, divest from or put sanctions on the Jewish state of Israel. I believe that our student government has no business taking a stand against democratic countries, and I will not tolerate any attempt to do so. As commuter senator, I also hope to improve parking on campus. I believe that if you pay for a parking spot in a certain lot you should be guaranteed that spot in that lot, no matter what. I find it particularly unfair when USC hosts special events on campus and entire parking lots become full. Students who park in these lots are never notified about these events and are then forced to drive aimlessly around campus to find a spot in another lot. Parking spots, if paid for, should be guaranteed. If there was one thing I would change about USC, it would be to make the university a friendlier place for diversity of thought. As a campus, we place importance on diversity of race, but I think that it is equally important to think about diversity of thought. All too often I feel that students who think differently than their professors are too scared to speak up for what they believe in. Efforts to impose comfortable speech on campus only restrict the speech of other students with different opinions.

The structure of GSG. Design by Samantha Chiu.
Graduate students account for more than 50 percent of the student population at USC, yet Graduate Student Government is often much less visible on campus than its undergraduate counterpart. It tackles many similar issues and faces many of the same challenges, but because of the nature of the graduate student experience, GSG has a much different process from USG.
GSG held elections on Feb. 9 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the Radisson Hotel at USC. Unlike USG, in which the entire student body votes for officers, the GSG Senate elects GSG officers. Elections are only for three positions: president, vice president and director of Health Sciences campus.
The president of GSG serves four primary functions: representing GSG to the administration and other university committees; maintaining and supporting internal programs and staff; managing the GSG office and administrative budget; and representing GSG to external organizations.
The vice president is responsible for administering the GSG Travel Grant program, acting as chief of staff for the executive board, planning weekly meetings, supporting the GSG residents and running the GSG Special Projects Committee.
The director of Health Sciences campus represents HSC at the university level, runs the HSC Concerns Committee, oversees and supports the HSC Governing Council and serves as a liaison for HSC to the University Park campus.
Representatives from each graduate program make up the GSG Senate. Each program receives one representative for each 2 percent of the total graduate student population in their program, up to six senators. For example, if a program’s population made up 10 percent of the total graduate population, it would have five senators. Each program can decide their own process for selecting senators.
Travis Brashears, a second-year law student, is the current director of Elections and Recruitment. He is in charge of organizing the elections and recruiting new GSG members.
“The hard part about our job is that because all of the grad programs are so siloed and so different, we really don’t have the ability to know exactly what’s going on and what the graduate students need,” Brashears said. “That’s really what the Senate does — we try to find as many ways possible to express what their concerns are.”
The executive board of GSG is divided into departments, each led by its own director. These departments include areas like community service, campus affairs and finance. After the election, the current director, along with the current and incoming elected officers, will select the directors. Once these nominations have been made, the senate has two weeks to pull candidates before a confirmation vote of the full Senate.
In order to be eligible for executive board positions, a student must serve for at least one full semester in one of the following positions: GSG Senator, executive board member, GSG committee member, University Committee member or USC-recognized graduate student group executive board member.
Brashears said that one of the unique challenges for GSG that directly affects his job is a lack of student involvement.
“Grad students are very busy,” Brashears said. “Their schedules don’t really work well with having student government and other obligations on campus. Sometimes it’s hard to find people at all. So that’s the big concern — trying to get the word out and get people involved.”
Students can get involved in GSG in many different ways. All Senate and executive board meetings have an open-door policy. Students can either drop in at meetings or give advance notice to have time set aside to address the full Senate. They can also contact their respective senators directly about any issues or concerns. If students want to be considered for one of the three elected positions, they must have a candidate statement and application prepared by the time of the election.
Brashears stressed the importance of student involvement, even for those students not directly involved with GSG. Because the graduate experience differs so greatly between schools, senators rely heavily on feedback from constituents.
“The hard part about our job is that because all of the grad programs are so siloed and so different, we really don’t have the ability to know exactly what’s going on and what the graduate students need … we try to find as many ways possible to express what their concerns are. We then look into finding ways to improve the experience of the students,” Brashears said.
The topics that GSG addresses vary greatly, depending on the specific needs of graduate students. GSG has worked to create an intercampus shuttle between the Health Sciences campus and University Park. They have also passed bicycle safety resolutions and are currently looking into creating designated smoking areas on campus.
Brashears also said that there has been a renewed push for greater cooperation between USG and GSG recently.
“Historically, there’s been a big division,” he said. “We share support staff, but our president and USG’s president have made a big push trying to get more intertwined. It’s tough because most of the big events that are thrown at school are done every year. and they’ve been historically paid for by one group or another, historically attended by one group or another, and so it’s tough sometimes to come together.”
Though USG and GSG generally operate independently, they cooperatively planned last year’s Green Initiative with over 45 different environment-focused programs.
Yohey Tokumitsu, a second-year doctorate of education student, is the current president of GSG. He praised the freedom the university gives GSG to address challenges facing graduate students.
“The opportunities that I get — I sit on the Board of Governors, I meet Trustees. The university gives us a huge voice in what happens in the university,” he said.

USG presidential candidate Providence Ilisevich — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
Providence Ilisevich and Ehren Elder hope to bring an outside perspective with insider knowledge to Undergraduate Student Government. A junior studying industrial and systems engineering from Potomac, Md., Ilisevich hopes to take on the role of president. Her running mate, Elder, is a junior from Los Altos, California double majoring in philosophy, politics and law and economics. The two worked together extensively this year before deciding to run together.
“I couldn’t believe in someone more than [Providence],” Elder said. “She’s so passionate, so talented and so knowledgeable about the issues she cares about.”
Ilisevich and Elder’s range of campus involvement provides them with a breadth of experience that they can use next year if elected. Besides being a Senate aide her sophomore year and a Greek senator this year within USG, Ilisevich has also participated in RISE Student Alliance, Alpha Pi Mu and Women and Youth Supporting Each Other. 
Ilisevich’s running mate, Ehren Elder — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
Elder, on the other hand, has a different perspective on student life as a result of his experiences as an orientation advisor, spirit leader and executive vice president and director of Greek education of the Interfraternity Council. Though Elder was never an official part of USG, he has worked extensively with its members in the past.
“We have the balance as a ticket of inside and outside experience,” Ilisevich said. “Ehren brings in this outside perspective as a leader who has served the school in many different aspects and who has worked closely with [Vice Provost of Student Affairs] Dr. [Ainsley] Carry and other administrators, but who also knows what it’s like to be a student not in USG and to face the frustration of not being able to get to the table.”
Ilisevich and Elder run on the platform “Because your voice matters.” Design by Samantha Chiu
Ilisevich and Elder are running under the platform “because your voice matters.” In an effort to bring a stronger student voice to USG and administrators, they have reached out to different on-campus organizations to gain a better understanding of students’ concerns and have expressed interest in organizing town hall meetings to allows students to meet with administrators to discuss important issues, as well as having senators make the most of their external office hours. The duo wants to implement more of an open-door policy that would allow students to freely express their thoughts. 
“I think there is a need at this university for more of a focus on the student voice and the experiences of current students, and I think that with a new provost coming this spring, it’s an incredible opportunity for us to reframe the conversation and reexamine the relationship administrators have with students,” Elder said. 
Besides establishing a stronger student voice in university affairs, Ilisevich and Elder also hope to implement changes to student life, the academic experience, safety, wellness and sustainability. They support ongoing work of student advocates for gender-neutral housing and bathrooms and would like to begin initiatives to create programming space, a fall break and longer library hours. Ilisevich also hopes to build on her current successful partnership with Academic Affairs in extending the drop deadline to seven weeks. Both want to increase the number of two-unit art classes and other electives that are available to students and push for more student input in the curriculum. 
 “A lot of parts of academics in higher education can sometimes just be focused on research, but I think it’s really important to have a university that’s focusing on all aspects of the academic experience,” Ilisevich said. 
Another key component of their platform is addressing sexual assault. Ilisevich and Elder hope to improve on-campus resources for the survivors of sexual assaults, whether in the form of prevention programming or more training and advocates that can connect students to the Rape Treatment Center in Santa Monica, California.
“For sexual assault, there’s a great opportunity to work on specific programming that will empower student leaders within their respective organizations to really make change and plant seeds that will change the dialogue,” Elder said. 
Ilisevich and Elder, aware of the challenges that come along with implementing such changes and policies, plan on using their connections and their past leadership experience to bridge the gap that sometimes exists between USG and the student body and between the student body and administrators. 
Having served in student government and worked on multiple committees, Ilisevich feels that she has seen it from the inside. Meanwhile, Elder sees himself as providing an outside set of eyes and ears. The two may have worked in separate spheres of student life in the past — which does have some overlap, as both are leaders in the Greek community — but if elected, they are confident that they will make an effective team.

Cafés in Los Angeles are a dime a dozen. Lunch on Melrose, drinks in Beverly Hills, coffee in Silver Lake – they’re about as common as sunshine. With so many options, how do you decide where to go? Look no further than the hidden gem in Los Angeles, The Alcove Café and Bakery.
The Alcove is archetypal L.A. Nestled near the Griffith Observatory in Los Feliz, it’s the answer to your every lunch need. Want a healthy-conscious salad that tastes like a cheat day? Want a burger with a boat-load fries? Literally – the fries are massive – the Alcove has it all.
Let’s talk décor. You feel like you’re in Alice in Wonderland. The trees, the ivy on the walls, the cobblestone, it’s as if you’re in a small village in fairy tale, yet the patio still emanates L.A. posh. Stand outside and it feels like a dream. When you applied to USC and thought of the fun you’d have in the city, pretending you’re a movie star or having lunch with some real estate magnate who offers you an internship, this is the spot you’re imagining.
Worried about money? You won’t be burning your pocket here. For what you get, it’s a great value. With great food, the coffee and tea are some of the best in town, and dessert is a must at the bakery. Their classic blackened chicken salad is what keeps people coming back. It’s a relatively hidden location and isolation from main roads makes it a hot spot for celebrities, so it won’t be uncommon to spot a famed face here and there while you’re enjoying your food.
Street parking is usually available on Hillhurst Avenue. Don’t park in the shopping center close by, you might get towed — and they do check. Valet is available at the front as well. There is always Uber as well and it is possible to Metro from campus, but you may find yourself walking and taking up time.
Next time you’re free for lunch or just want to explore L.A. with friends, check out The Alcove!

Jordyn Holman | Daily Trojan
In London, the cost of being cultured is relatively cheap. In my three weeks studying in the heart of the British Empire, I’ve explored a wide range of the free museums, churches and art galleries. Among the museums I’ve visited are the Museum of London, the British Museum and the National Gallery. By visiting these cultural hubs, which for the most part are free, those interested are able to get a real taste of the politics, history and current issues facing my adopted city of London.
In Los Angeles, USC sits adjacent to the city’s museum campus, which includes the African American Museum and the California Science Center. Yet when you consider the more than 300 museums London has to offer, it pales in comparison. Museums offer a window into the society. So when a society is completely new like Britain’s was to me that was my best resource for getting a crash course history lesson.
London also has a plethora of palaces, large cathedrals and historic abbeys to visit. Despite my low chances of ever being royalty and me not being Church of England congregant, touring those venues offered more insight into British culture. The high-rising ceilings, intricate stained glass windows, portraits of royalty from the Tudor dynasty down to Prince William and Kate Middleton have all helped inform me of some aspects the country has valued over the centuries: religion, custom, class. (Also, as an American, the fact that these cultural centers have nearly 2,000 years of history to cover is daunting.)
Before coming to London, I would never have thought I’d wake up early to tour a museum before class. But now I do just that. There’s just so much to learn — and for free. You can’t beat that.
Plus, it helps me save money. According to Europe Backpacker Index, London is regularly one of the most expensive cities to travel to because of pricey tourist attractions. Therefore, the museums, art galleries and churches are a great way around that.
Museums also supplement the lessons taught in my classes (or “modules,” as they call them at British universities). Often when discussing arts culture in London, I’m able to contextualize it because I now know about Queen Victoria’s lengthy reign or how King Henry VIII changed England’s religion from Catholicism to Protestantism.

Oh, sunny Los Angeles. This city hails some of the best temperatures in the state. But what happens when the clear skies and warm rays are gone? USC rarely experiences rain, but when it does it may seem like all hell breaks loose. The smallest puddle has the ability to cause complete mayhem. Here’s a run through a rainy day at USC.
Students leave for their class in shorts and a tank expecting a blast of hot air as they leave their room. Not bothering to look out the window because L.A. is always sunny, the unexpected rain and wind throw off everyone’s day. Just getting to class can pose the ultimate battle. The thousands of bikers and skateboarders fight through the rain with their wheels. Yet, avoiding puddles while moving at high speeds is not an easy task while students are walking to their 11 a.m. class.
Then the inevitable happens.
Water is splashed up and people are drenched in some not-so-sanitary water. Accidentally walk in a puddle? Well, it looks like you are going to have some sopping feet for your next class. For the most part, the students at USC despise the rain. Many people leave their cold hometowns for the warm weather of L.A. When it seems like all hope is lost, students try to find ways to make what seems like a tropical storm less sad. Here are some ways different people do.
Women daydream about getting swept off their feet and enjoying a romantic evening with a special someone.

The men imagine things more questionable, such as lovely ladies in Burger King commercials washing a car.

When the rain is finally looking like it is going away, students rejoice at the weather forecast for the following day. Back to sunny and 75 degrees, the real USC weather.

USG presidential candidate Rini Sampath — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
Aside from having set historical precedent as the first female presidential ticket, Rini Sampath and Jordan Fowler have created platform points that strive to produce their mantra of “real results.” 
During their campaign, Sampath and Fowler stressed the importance of collaboration and communication. By bringing together student organizations in a collaborative problem-solving effort, the duo hopes to create a positive impact on the entire student body.
“I think the vision that we have for USC is to see it change from an institution where students who feel disconnected from their administration to a school where they feel connected and integrated,” Sampath said. “When we have that goal in mind, I think the pursuit of that is going to always keep us going.” 
Both Sampath and Fowler have been active participants within various branches of USG since entering USC. Sampath currently serves as USG vice president and Fowler serves as director of university affairs. 
USG vice presidential candidate Jordan Fowler — Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
In past years, Fowler worked as a delegate for external relations, where Sampath was the assistant director. When Sampath was promoted to co-director, Fowler took the position of assistant director and was then hired by Sampath to become the director of university affairs.
“I think having the USG experience for both Jordan and I, does give us that full understanding of how the organization itself functions,” Sampath said.
Of the campus organizations that chose to give endorsements to the presidential candidates, Sampath and Fowler’s campaign received the most. Some of these sponsors include, Public Relations Student Society of America, Trojan Knights and Motivate & Empower. 
Sampath has had a variety of international experiences. Born in India, Sampath resided in the country until she was 3 years old and then moved to Singapore, where she lived until age 6. Since moving to America with her family, Sampath has lived in a total of 15 cities. Sampath’s family currently resides in Irvine, California, where Sampath attended high school and served as student body president. 
Sampath and Fowler have created platform points that strive to produce their mantra of “real results.” Design by Samantha Chiu
“I think that in the process of growing up in a traditional family, there were a lot of expectations to become an engineer or to become a doctor and I was the one who kind of came out of left field and wanted to go in the government and work for my country,” Sampath said.
Fowler described her childhood and adolescence as a fusion of two worlds. Her father is of Jamaican descent and her mother, Russian. She grew up with a heavy emphasis on the importance of balancing work and education. Aside from her duties as a full-time student and director of university affairs, Fowler serves as a peer-leadership counselor at the Office of Campus Activities and student involvement coordinator for the USC Media Institute of Social Change.
Sampath is currently a junior majoring in international relations. She hopes to attend law school after college and aspires to eventually work in the U.S. State Department as a diplomat. In addition, Sampath spends her free time tutoring for Upward Bound, a program that offers low-income students in the south Los Angeles area the opportunity for guidance in various school subjects.
As a spring admit, Sampath has worked towards creating fall housing for spring admits to facilitate easier transition. Additionally, Sampath and Fowler’s platform points carry over from changes they have worked to implement during current terms in USG.
“I think each of these really reflects how expansive our reach is in terms of our platform,” Sampath said. “Instead of just focusing on one community, we’re looking at every community on campus or nearly every community. If students feel like something is missing, we want to implement that in our platform as well. It’s more of a two-way street.”
Furthermore, Sampath explained that she was motivated to run in the presidential race again after she and Fowler took on a large project to improve accessibility for students with disabilities. 
“Moving forward, a lot of people asked me if I was going to run again,” Sampath said. “At that time, my honest answer was, ‘Probably not.’ I thought, ‘You know, this is my year to give it my all.’ But, as I was picking up some projects I really cared about, like sexual assault prevention on campus or accessibility for students with disabilities — the momentum that we had was so unparalleled, that if I had that one extra year, especially with Jordan, if we had that year together, I think it would just be really incredible to just continue the projects, to continue the change on campus.”
Fowler commented that Sampath has been a role model and inspiration to her since the beginning of her time at USC. 
“I say she’s been my role model and mentor, since day one,” Fowler said. “She’s one of the first people I met when I stepped on this campus, so having someone like that ask me to run with her and be by her side, was absolutely the biggest honor I’ve ever been given in my whole life.”
Sampath explained that a balanced ticket requires a connection on both personal and professional levels.
“We’ve worked together since day one. Not only do we see each other on a personal level, but we are always connected on a professional level. If students were to place that trust in us to elect us as president and vice-president, we can assure you that we’re actually going to be able to run an effective organization and run an effective school,” Sampath said.

U.S. House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke to nearly 200 USC students, faculty and guests Monday morning, discussing her rise to political office and the feasibility of bipartisanship in a Republican-dominated Congress.
The event was a part of the political science department’s Political Conversations series, a string of discussions that seeks to engage contemporary political leaders on trending issues from Washington. Pelosi has been the most prolific guest to date.
“Thank you so much for the invitation to be here,” Pelosi said during the event’s opening. “USC is a beacon of light in the world of education and research.”
Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics Robert Shrum, a longtime friend of the congresswoman, hosted the conversation. Pelosi, who affectionately referred to Shrum as “Shrummy” throughout the event, spoke candidly on her initial hesitations regarding entering political leadership when she was a member of the Democratic National Committee in the 1980s.
“We [all] have to take responsibility for the direction of our country,” Pelosi said. “[But] I had absolutely no intention of running for office … I was more behind-the-scenes.”
The aversion to campaigning, however, did not last long. Pelosi would go on to be elected as the representative of California’s 5th Congressional District in 1987 (now she represents the 12th) and later as the first woman speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011. She described her political escalation as “going from housewife to House speaker” and from “kitchen to Congress.”
The discussion quickly shifted to the current political landscape, where Pelosi currently serves as the House Democratic leader and the Republicans hold the majority in both the House and the Senate.
The topic revolved heavily around the possibility of bipartisanship, and Pelosi described her stance as hopeful, but was critical of the opposing party’s current behavior. She described the Republican Congress as being more concerned with “obstructing” rather than “legislating,” and described its nature as “anti-governance.”
Pelosi stressed, however, that there is recent precedence for the two parties to work together in some capacity, something she witnessed when the Democratic Party held a majority in both houses under President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2008.
“For two years, we worked with President Bush and got a great deal,” Pelosi said, specifically mentioning the raising of emission standards and amendments to the Voting Rights Act, among other pieces of legislation.
Not unconscious of her audience, the congresswoman also stressed the need for proper education funding, speaking disparagingly of Republican-recommended cuts.
“[Cutting education] is one of the dumbest things you could do,” Pelosi said, citing a Republican desire for reductions in Pell grants (need-based money for undergraduate education) to lower the national deficit. “Nothing brings more money to the treasury than the education of the American people.”
Pelosi’s frustration with the Republican Party was evident during the discussion, and the conversation wasn’t without subtle jabs at the GOP. She described the Republicans in Congress as being anti-governance, anti-science and anti-Barack Obama.
“They have a trifecta of justification for shutting down government [and] not lifting the debt ceiling,” she said. “That’s what we’re contending with.”
Shrum, who was a Democratic political consultant before coming to USC, was also not without choice words for the opposing party.
“There is a visceral hate of Barack Obama and a belief in the Republican Party that he is not a legitimate president,” he said. Pelosi advised those in the audience who were members of the GOP to change their party from within.
In the second portion of the discussion, Pelosi took questions from the students and faculty in the audience. A student questioned the congresswoman on whether Congress’ current state of gridlock is a modern phenomenon or indicative of age-old political tensions.
“There’s always been a healthy difference of opinion … [but] I have never seen it this bad,” Pelosi said.
She elaborated that today’s Congress is worse than the political divide that existed in the 1990s, or what she referred to as the politics of “personal destruction,” during which the Republican-led House in 1998 impeached former President Bill Clinton.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan following the event, Pelosi discussed matters pertinent to students at USC, such as the escalating cost of college and how her party’s focus is on eliminating hindrances to the access of federal aid money.
“We have to recognize that the United States has to invest in our future by investing in our young people and your education,” she said. “From my experience now, most young people don’t really care about [political] parties so much, and that’s okay, as long as we have shared values we’re fighting for.”
The congresswoman concluded by reflecting on the desire for increased participation among college-aged students in the political area, and that the turnout at Monday’s event was indicative of a demographic willing to get involved.
“The fact that this many people showed up for a discussion of the political stuff and how to be involved and how to be effective, it gave me hope and I hope it gave them hope.”

Though Undergraduate Student Government can seem insular, student leaders utilize the methods at their disposal to create campus change.
One powerful method is the resolution.
“Resolutions basically gauge student interest,” said Samantha Cheng, a USG residential senator. “They’re not really binding but they’re a way for us to show administrators that yes, this is something students want.” 
Issues from the student body often arise during various committee meetings, which always have at least one attending senator with the authority to spearhead a resolution effort if it materializes.
“It can be brought up by regular students,” Cheng said. “If they have an issue, they can come to us. The resolutions do have to be sponsored by a senator who normally helps in drafting it.” 
Senators and members of the particular advocacy committee then do preliminary research. 
“They ask, ‘Has it been done before?’” Cheng said. “Has it been approached by USC students in the past? How is it at other schools? If you do the research behind it to back it up, it’s effective.”    
Cheng explained that the keystone of a resolution is evidence from polls surveying students on a particular issue after doing the research behind it. 
“We go to the entire student body; we promote it on Facebook and through our website so students can take the surveys and we see how relevant it is to them,” Cheng said. “If they say, ‘Yes, this is something I want to do,’ then we start to come up with the resolution.” 
The extension of the drop deadline, for example, was one of two resolutions passed last semester; student support played a crucial role in the effort’s success.
“A resolution basically says we have gone to USC students, we have the statistics, we have the poll which is supposed to be representative of the selected body,” said Aaron Rifkind, USG senior adviser and current residential senatorial candidate. “It’s saying, ‘We have data in support of this idea.’” 
From there, USG officers speak with administrators before drafting the resolution.
“Senators don’t pass resolutions if they know they’re not going to be successful,” Rifkind said. “The ones we do pass usually have sway. They carry weight, and to keep it that way we don’t want to start doing silly things the administration doesn’t care about or we know they won’t pass.” 
The resolution itself then includes the history of the issue on campus and at other schools of similar size, what change students want, and evidence of why it should be changed. Senators often take advantage of insight from administrators to guide them on policy.
“Most of the time you can try speaking to undergraduate advisers or ask people on campus affairs, they’re really attentive to what you have to say, and they’ll give their opinions,” Cheng said. 
 A completed resolution is then presented to a 12-member senate one week and voted on in the next. There are three Greek, three commuter and six residential senators. 
Cheng said the success of a resolution ultimately depends on which facet of campus affairs it addresses.   
“With the drop deadline, for example, it was ultimately up to the administration because it was an administrative issue, so when the resolution passed they were the ones who said, ‘Yes, we’ll implement this,’” she said. “With issues on things like SCampus, though, you can run into legal issues.” 
Changing parts of the SCampus, for example, requires going through a legal process in addition to the administrative motions of passing a resolution, as SCampus serves as a contract. 
In addition to the extension of the drop deadline, the ongoing renovations of Leavey Library stemmed from a USG resolution that articulated student interest.   
“I think USG members are the best ones to make those kinds of changes,” said Sean Thomas, a freshman majoring in biology. “They should have a say in what goes on in the libraries and on campus in general because they know from a student perspective what people like.” 
One misconception Rifkind has observed about USG is that students believe it to be more exclusive than it actually is, since resolutions and other work confined within the walls of TCC 205.   
“What most students don’t know is that anyone can come to hear the presentations made for resolutions,” Rifkind said. “Committees have to present once a month to senate and I don’t know if students are aware that this happens, or that it’s a venue they could use if they wanted to get something changed.” 
One student proposed that USG do more outreach and promotion of what the organization really gets done. 
 “A town hall-type meeting would be a good idea, or some digital form of it, and then making an effort to talking to student groups on campus more and actually going up to them instead of waiting for them to make a complaint,” said Tyler Matheson, a freshman studying business administration.        
Ultimately, the senators and the resolutions they create to improve the school are meant to be representative of the needs of the student body. 
“The senators are here to represent the students on campus,” Rifkind said. “The only elected positions on USG are senators, the president and vice president, so the senators do their best to voice the student support.”

If you’ve been hearing a lot more about Undergraduate Student Government than usual this past year, you’re not alone. The executive team behind USG President Andrew Menard and Vice President Rini Sampath has been hard at work publicizing and promoting the efforts of USG in order to make student government more transparent and accessible to those whom they represent.
“This is not about Menard or Rini taking credit for things that other people have worked on — we literally have been very fortunate to have the most amazing people helping us and working with us for this past year,” Menard said.
Among the many goals USG has pursued this year include the proposal for a fall break, the reduction of fees charged for student use of campus facilities, the expansion of current tuition to cover 20 units instead of 18, increased accessibility for students with disabilities, the Black House initiative and increased outreach to students admitted in the spring semester with a spring admit guide and discussion of potential housing for those students.
Some of the hoped-for changes have yet to be made, though progress has been ongoing. Much of the outcome depends on the university’s response to the policies for which USG advocates.
“A lot of these projects take time and a hefty amount of research.  For example, in compiling the Black House initiative, we looked at nearly every university that has something similar — Georgetown, Yale, Stanford — we even visited Stanford to obstain pictures of what their house looked like there,” Sampath said. 
Sampath is part of the leadership team on the communication, public relations and social media task force that aims to establish a Black House at USC that would provide academic and social support as well as mentorship for students. The project is not expected to be completed for another five to 10 years.
Menard and Sampath feel that they have had productive conversations with administrators, including President C.L. Max Nikias as well as Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, who are willing to listen to student voices.
“I think administrators are definitely here to listen, it’s just a matter of making sure that we take advantage of all of those opportunities and ensure the voice is heard at every level,” Sampath said.
Menard and Sampath expressed that Nikias has been receptive to issues they’ve raised with him, including increased access for students with disabilities as well as reduced expenses that students are mandated to pay the university for programming. 
Menard said that students are forced to pay USC for large-scale events that require Dept. of Public Safety officers, security ambassadors and fencing. Other examples of expenses include a charge for keeping the sprinklers off during an event, even if the sprinklers were not scheduled to be on.
“[Nikias] said students shouldn’t have to pay for the security expenses, which I agree with, and I appreciate the support, but now we have to get into the logistics of how we’re going to do that,” Menard said.
Accountability and a sense of getting things done have been priorities for Menard and Sampath. Menard noted that this mentality was a deliberate choice for his presidential ticket.
“That was my main priority this year — Rini and I and the rest of our execs wanted to emphasize that we were not just going to talk about the things that we were going to do. We were actually going to do them,” he said.
Sampath noted that student outreach was one of her priorities as well. 
“I really do enjoy the responsibility I have to answer to students,” she said. “I’ve gotten messages on Facebook or people have stopped me on campus asking me everything from, ‘Rini, the hourly wages I have in my position as a student worker simply aren’t enough to support my lifestyle,’ or ‘What’s the status with expanding hours at Doheny? Leavey isn’t necessarily my favorite place to study.’ I love talking to students in that context, being able to earn their trust so that we can actually make a difference for their needs or concerns.”
Though administrators have been meeting with USG about a variety of proposals, ongoing student concerns include expanding tuition to cover 20 units as opposed to the usual 18. Sampath noted that administrators were not as receptive to the expansion as they had been regarding other proposals.
“We didn’t have the same reception because maybe USC isn’t financially equipped to handle that kind of expansion, so moving forward, we have to try a different avenue in which we can accomplish that,” she said.
Through SpeakSC forums established this year, Menard and Sampath hope they have brought a greater sense of connectivity between students who are not involved with student government and administrators. Further plans include the creation of a video to better communicate USG’s next steps as well as a potential State of the Union-type address. 
For their future plans, while Sampath is running again this year, this time for USG president, Menard has a position lined up at Eastdil Secured, a real estate investment bank in Santa Monica, where he will work after graduation.
“Ultimately, I feel very fortunate to have met some amazing people on this journey and very, very grateful for all of our friends and everyone who worked on our campaign team to put Rini and I in this position,” he said.

Just a block down from the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Bunker Hill, Pez Cantina sits in front of a large bank that does not initially scream “authentic Mexican food.” Once inside, however, one is immediately drawn to the cool ambiance and artful decor that promise an eventful dining experience.
Pez Cantina, the most recent project of ice cream parlor Milk’s co-founder Bret Thompson, only opened in December of last year. The restaurant seems to still be in the process of playing around with its menu and setup, as the menus were slightly different from each other — much to the chagrin of the waiter — and restaurant staff adjusted tables in the main dining room repeatedly throughout the night. The space Pez Cantina sits in is a bizarre L-shape that surely proved to be a challenge for its interior designer. That said, it does a good job of making the area feel coherent, and as its website says, like “an oasis-type atmosphere.”
The staff is attentive and friendly, though possibly a little stressed. Recommendations from the waiter are very welcome as the extensive menu offers so many enticing dishes that it can be difficult to decide on even a salsa flavor. Chips and salsa are $3. At first glance this might seem excessive, as they are usually offered at restaurants for free, but what Pez Cantina offers is more than worth the money. The chips are fresh and crisp, making it impossible to stop eating them, and the poblano crema salsa is creamy and aromatic. It is tempting to fill up on this alone, but well worth it to pace oneself as there is a lot at the restaurant worth tasting.
Pez Cantina’s menu has a lot going on, ranging from smaller plates perfect for sharing and reasonably priced at around $10 each, to pricier entrees starting from around $25. They also have an extensive taco menu offering more familiar tacos like al pastor, as well as unexpected ones like crispy sweetbreads and beef tongue. The restaurant offers up so many twists on traditional favorites that ordering a meal is an experience of its own.
The Yucatan pork taquitos are crispy and rich, but the real winning part of this appetizer is the bed of toasted almond guacamole they are artfully set upon. The subtle and fresh avocado pairs perfectly with the smoky nuts to provide a balanced and delicious dip.
The pez (fish) and chips, not a food one would usually expect to find at a Mexican restaurant, is buttery and rich with a wonderfully light batter that doesn’t overpower the fish. The lime aioli that comes with it is practically worth eating alone, and goes deliciously with almost anything dipped in it.
Their tacos are generously portioned, with plentiful heaps of meat on steaming tortillas and sprinklings of fresh onion and cilantro. The carne asada is tender and flavorful and pairs wonderfully with the salsa verde that comes next to it. The chicken tinga is sweet and smoky though a little bit watery, and the chile verde carnitas is rich and perfectly spicy. Grilled pineapple complements the al pastor taco, which is by far the best of the bunch. The crisped meat and the light bits of succulent fruit together create an amazing taco that is far too quick to go.
The only disappointment came from the watermelon agua fresca, which was more ice than drink and lacked the sweetness one expects from an agua fresca. But, dessert more than made up for it. Apple fritters generously dusted in cinnamon come with a scoop of made-in-house almond ice cream was the highlight of the dessert, if not the entire meal. The richness of the ice cream and the subtle bite of the cinnamon work wonderfully together to create a balanced end to dinner.
The tasteful presentation and fresh quality of the food suggests a pricier meal, but in fact, Pez Cantina provides a good deal for a reasonable price. Pez Cantina is a great dinner destination for students looking for a fun but upscale date spot that won’t break the bank, or a dinner with family after a visit to the Los Angeles Philharmonic down the street. Amid the bustle of downtown Los Angeles, the restaurant is a comfortable oasis and a must-try for those seeking a fresh twist on south-of-the-border cuisine.
