Many sports fans had been anticipating this year’s NFL Draft for a while as it provided some of the first live sports coverage since the coronavirus outbreak. However, as in every draft, there were clear winners and losers: Some teams most definitely improved while others made questionable decisions. 
Winner: Indianapolis Colts
While many teams had amazing draft classes, including the Baltimore Ravens and Arizona Cardinals, the Colts got the best value out of their picks, even though they traded their first-round selection for defensive lineman DeForest Buckner. This in and of itself was a win for the Colts because they weren’t going to attain a player of Buckner’s caliber with that pick anyway.
The first need that the Colts filled was a wide receiver. The Colts have almost no experience or reliability in that position aside from T.Y. Hilton, who was forced to take on a heavy workload the past few seasons. Despite missing six games and losing quarterback Andrew Luck, Hilton’s stats took a nosedive: His 90.7 receiving yards per game in 2018 fell to 50.1 yards in 2019. It was clear he needed help and the Colts got exactly that by picking USC receiver Michael Pittman Jr.
With 11 touchdowns and more than 1,200 receiving yards in 2019, Pittman should make an immediate impact on the Colts’ receiving corps and should probably be the second option for quarterback Philip Rivers next season. 
After Pittman, the Colts took Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor, an explosive, exciting athlete. Taylor will provide a lot of support for Marlon Mack, who is coming off of an over 1,000-yard season. Even though Mack is a solid starter, Taylor could eventually compete for his spot and become an even better player behind one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. 
While these two picks were already impressive, the team’s best value pick was a fourth-round steal in former Washington quarterback Jacob Eason. With Rivers aging and nearing the end of his career, it’s possible that the Colts foresee Eason learning and growing his game under the tutelage of Rivers before eventually taking over the starting role. Eason fell very far in the draft because of his inconsistent performance, but his big arm and high ceiling should put the Colts in a great position for the future.
Loser: Green Bay Packers
The Packers hurt themselves more than they helped themselves during this draft. The team has created a lot of controversy by using their 26th pick on former Utah State quarterback Jordan Love, which didn’t make much sense. Current starter Aaron Rodgers is still performing at an elite level and seems to have several more years left in him before he starts to decline. At first, it seemed like Love would be a long-term replacement for Rodgers, but it’s not feasible to make an investment that won’t pay off for several years so early in the draft. This has raised a lot of questions about Rodgers’ relationship with the organization and whether or not there is tension.
Rodgers himself said before the draft that he’d like to see Green Bay select a skill position player and after the Packers traded up from the 30th pick with the Miami Dolphins — who selected promising Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and USC offensive lineman Austin Jackson — ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. was on air saying that Green Bay desperately needs a wide receiver to help Rodgers. It seems as if new head coach Matt LeFleur and general manager Brian Gutekunst wished to ignore both opinions by selecting Love.
The Packers made another strange choice by picking running back A.J. Dillon in the second round. With Aaron Jones proving himself as a solid starter this past season, this selection also lacks logic. Neither Dillon nor Love will make an impact this season for the Packers, and even their long-term impact is uncertain based on Green Bay’s current situation with Jones and Rodgers. 
In the third round, the Packers picked tight end Josiah Deguara of Cincinnati to add further doubt to the team’s draft class. What makes this move intriguing is that there was a noticeable lack of talent at the tight end position in this year’s class and an overwhelming amount of talent in the wide receiver area. 
The Packers failed to address immediate concerns by not drafting players at necessary positions as they desperately needed some help at wide receiver. Other than Davante Adams, the Packers lack the weapons they need for Rodgers and the offense to flourish outside the run game. The Packers had the opportunity to improve their team in several areas this year, and put simply, they failed to do so. They’ll pay the price for these costly mistakes in both the short and the long term.

From their respective homes across the nation, activists and USC students came together Monday evening to perform “Pause,” an original and interactive play about restorative justice and the failures of the U.S. prison system.
The Visions and Voices event was a product of “Performing Policy: The Justice Project,” a theatre performance program that connects students from professor Brent Blair and Sol Price School of Public Policy doctoral candidate Jocelyn Poe’s classes with formerly incarcerated people.
Blair, who leads the program and is a professor of theatre practice, worked with Poe, who is also a Price faculty member, and Javier Stauring from Healing Dialogue and Action, an organization focused on restorative justice.
Unlike most Vision and Voices events, the play was presented on Zoom, instead of in a traditional theatre, which made for a memorable performance. Despite a few brief technical difficulties, the production proved to be a success with 190 people in attendance, learning that theatre and policy are in fact interconnected.
“I can’t see any of you, I’m trusting that you’re there,” Blair said. “I hope that you can trust that I’m here and that we’re together in the same space and heart.”
The play centers on Christian Branscombe and Tobias Tubbs, two individuals who were convicted of separate violent crimes and sent to the California State Prison in L.A. County. Branscombe was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole while Tubbs was given two life sentences. Both men have since been freed and perform as themselves in the play.
Students from Blair and Poe’s classes “Theatre in the Community” and “Topics in Public Policy and Urban Studies,” respectively, act in secondary roles as a prison guard, a game show host and reporters, among many other roles. All scenes were skillfully crafted to explore different aspects of restorative justice, a form of criminal justice that focuses on rehabilitation rather than retribution through communication between victim and offender, and the reality of the prison system.
“It’s a story about challenges in the prison industrial complex and a hope and a prayer and action for restorative justice solution,” Blair said. 
Poe said one goal of the play is to help people understand that “each day the decisions we make, the choices we have are all influenced by policy.” She further shared how “using theatre as a method to explore policy provides us a unique opportunity to understand how policy impacts lived experiences resulting in better policy.”
The scenes are primarily set in a prison art room, Bare Bones. Prison’s art rooms provide a special place for the incarcerated to heal through activities like painting, reading and writing, and both Branscombe and Tubbs were advocates for these spaces while serving their time.
“We’ve created a space for Christians, Muslims, … Black and white people,” Tubbs said in the play. “For everybody to come in here and to heal and to love one another. Now that’s the truth, that’s the truth that’s gonna set us free.”
Throughout the play, the scenes “paused” and videos with statistics and information on the U.S. prison system and restorative justice were shared.
“Restorative justice programs have been proven to reduce recidivism by nearly 50% over time,” a voiceover stated. “One program in Wisconsin showed significant declines in youth violent arrests, crime and recidivism. Five years after the program began, violent juvenile offenses decreased [by] almost 49% and overall juvenile arrest rates decreased almost 45%.”
The hard facts aimed to dismantle a common narrative that restorative justice programs are a waste of taxpayer dollars and generally unhelpful.
The play also reenacted the many times Branscombe and Tubbs were targeted by prison security guards who impeded on their art sessions, seemingly just to get a rise out of them.
“Alright, ladies, break it up,” said an officer played by Adam Torres, a sophomore majoring in theatre. “Pack up your stuff and get back to your cells.” 
Branscrombe replied, “Back to our cells? We have the room for a full two hours, we just got in here.” 
These scenes detailed the tribulations the duo faced as inmates, but also the power of restorative justice. 
“There’s only two entities — entities of light and entities of darkness,” Tubbs said of overcoming the hostile environment that was prison. “Torres, he’s given himself over to a mean and vindictive spirit, bro. Imma reject it every time with my heart and with my mind.” 
To these men, restorative justice is anything but useless. Rather, it is a resource that leads to their releases and rehabilitation.
“Art healing programs have miraculous results,” Tubbs said. “I wouldn’t have been looking at freedom in five months if it wasn’t for Bare Bones.”
After the play ended, an audience member, Dr. James Gilligan, made connections between what he saw in the play and his own research. Gilligan is a psychiatrist and author of a series of books entitled “Violence,” where he draws on 25 years of work in the U.S. prison system to describe the motivation behind violent behavior.
“If you really care about the victims of violence then you want programs like this because this is how you prevent them from becoming victims in the first place,” Gilligan said on Zoom after the play concluded.
In one particularly relevant scene, mass incarceration was compared to the current coronavirus pandemic, providing a lens into the complexity of the U.S. prison system.
“Imagine social distancing in a cell with another person for your whole life — maybe not another person if you’re in solitary,” Mikki Benjamin, a senior majoring in theatre, said in a scene. “Prison is like having COVID-19 all the time.”
The play reminded audience members that prisons are meant to be a place of rehabilitation and not serve as a purely punitive environment. Restorative justice has the power to heal both survivors of violent crimes and the perpetrators, if the U.S. prison system chooses to embrace it.
“Hurt people hurt people,” Branscombe said, “and healed people heal people brother.”

As I’ve stated in this column many times before, stand up comedy, for many reasons, is a much different breed of cat than other art forms. Unlike film, music and visual art, comedy — especially stand up comedy — doesn’t often get the same pretension of subjectivity that these forms do. For one, people tend to think of themselves as intuitively good judges of comedy because it’s the one art form they participate in every day by telling jokes, even when they’re not that funny.
However, there is another equally important factor for why stand up comedy can be so difficult as both a performer and consumer. The work of comedians is almost entirely judged by the audience’s immediate, in-the-moment reaction to it. Audiences are the ultimate judge of whether or not a joke works — because they’re who it’s meant for. 
Sure, sometimes a comic might get a bad crowd that seems more inclined to judge than enjoy a performance, but for the most part, the consumer is always right. It’s why the notion of “political correctness” has been such a hot-button issue in comedy — it’s a perceived battle between the audience and the performer.
Still, as I’ve discussed in earlier columns, the concept of political correctness means many different things to many different people. Why shouldn’t comedians joke about marginalized communities? Why is it that some comedians are able to talk about certain things but others aren’t?
One of the most obvious, if sometimes unfortunate, rules in stand up comedy is that half of a joke’s success depends upon who is telling it. Reputation plays a pivotal role in how well an audience receives a joke from a comedian in the moment. A live audience is much more predisposed to laugh hard at a half-baked joke from Whitney Cummings than a meticulously conceived joke from Joe Schmoe.
There’s no way some of Dave Chappelle’s material from his recent specials would be lauded as brilliant if he wasn’t already grandfathered in as an all-time talent. Some of his jokes — especially those about alleged rape victims and the LGBTQ+ community — have received a fair amount of backlash from critics and viewers. Yet, audiences were overwhelmingly pleased with what Chappelle put out. Hell, he even won a couple of Grammys for it.
Would these jokes get the same kind of reception coming out of Shane Gillis’ mouth? Almost assuredly not. We know Chappelle; that’s just the kind of humor he’s always done and we continue to praise him for it. Audiences and critics obviously love him enough for him to receive the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2019.
Are these jokes bad? Is someone a bad person for laughing at them? That’s certainly up for debate. What’s not debatable, at least to me, is that they definitely sound a lot funnier coming from Chappelle than they do from many other people. 
In addition to reputation, context also matters in why we laugh at some jokes versus others. It’s always been my belief that certain, darker types of comedy operate on a suspension of belief. When Anthony Jeselnik jokes about dropping a baby, the audience laughs because of their fundamental understanding that he’s not being serious.
It’s for this reason why I believe Louis C.K.’s attempt to come back to stand up has been an ill-conceived dumpster fire to watch as a consumer. Some Louis C.K. diehards might claim that, no matter how he went about it, there was no avenue for him to convince certain audiences to forgive him and allow him to continue performing comedy, and they’re probably right. Many people would not forgive him after he admitted to sexual misconduct.
However, there was a large number of fans and nonfans willing to let the disgraced comic at least try to demonstrate that he had truly learned from his mistakes through his material, which is as dark and self-reflective as one can get. 
Unfortunately, his comic response, which is included in his new special titled “Sincerely Louis C.K.,” was so tonedeaf and irresponsible to not only his career but the notion of dark comedy in general. 
Again, dark comedy thrives on the suspension of belief — you know that the people joking about these subjects aren’t actually bad people. You wouldn’t be laughing at Jeselnik’s dead baby jokes if he had a history of clumsiness around infants. It’s the same reason why Louis C.K.’s once-brilliant darkness seemed rebellious, groundbreaking and strangely comforting when he didn’t have the reputation of being a real-life scumbag. It’s strange that the man whose whole stage persona once revolved around his fragile self-esteem now seems so eager to protect it.
In the special, C.K. does pull out some classic Louis-isms, including one bit about how he understands how one could be attracted to teenage boys, but these jokes that once seemed unbelievably dark and hilarious now seem strange and sinister. His act used to be so effective because it seemed to be him talking earnestly about his worst demons, the ones you never act on and are scared to talk about. 
The jokes hit differently when you know he’s the type of person to actually act on some of the disturbing things he talks about. Add the fact that he won’t apologize for the horrible things he’s actually done, and it becomes difficult to still find his material all that funny.
These situations are obviously all very different, and I am not the ultimate judge of comedy’s moral line. If I was then I’d be killing the open mics (in 2021). Though, if there was any purpose in writing this column, it was to spread one gospel — that comedy is an incredibly nuanced and legitimate art form, and it must be treated as such. It’s not just the jolt of “haha” that you get from consuming a funny TikTok (although it can definitely be that as well). It’s an art form built upon analyzing the missteps of life and finding truth within them. When it is done well, comedy is as important of a reflection of our culture as any creative interpretation. When it is watered down and weaponized, it only corrodes the medium for everyone who wants to participate in and enjoy it. It’s not that serious, but take it seriously — ya know?

The coronavirus pandemic has caused turmoil in virtually all sectors of life, including the workplace. In the United States, more than 26 million people have lost their job as of April 23. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, told The New York Times that he expects unemployment to hit 17% in April — higher than any rate since the Great Depression. 
Among the recently unemployed are student workers. As colleges across the nation have had to temporarily close down and move classes online due to the coronavirus, thousands of students have had to return home — for some, home is a drive away, while for others, home means crossing borders and oceans. This means that many students who hold on-campus jobs will no longer be able to work.
Fortunately at USC, some students have been able to continue working through the pandemic from home. However, there are many other students who work jobs that require an on-campus presence and for whom working remotely is impossible. USC has announced that all student workers will still receive payment for the hours they are normally scheduled through the end of this semester, regardless of whether or not they are actually working. However, it is unclear whether this can continue in the coming months.
As universities make the transition to remote instruction, they face substantial financial losses. Schools across the country, including USC, have started issuing refunds to students to accommodate for unused meal plans and vacated housing agreements. In addition, they will likely continue to lose money as facilities remain unable to operate and Class of 2024 student enrollment remains up in the air. 
Even if the University does reopen come fall, this does not eliminate the potential for financial aftershocks. If, in the future, USC is no longer able to pay student workers who are unable to work from home, there will need to be protections put in place.
Student workers play an important role in USC’s operations. They ensure that essential University facilities such as the libraries and USC Bookstore, among others, are running smoothly. Student workers are employed in virtually every department and college on campus. The University should ensure that students who have contributed to its operations in such an integral way receive the help they need if the continuance of their jobs is in question, especially given that financial aid is given by semester and doesn’t necessarily apply to summer.
Some students depend on the money they make by working on-campus jobs to afford tuition and other expenses. The federal work-study program allows students with a demonstrated financial need to pay for part of the cost of attendance by working part-time as they are enrolled in classes. Therefore, it would place a significant financial burden on any work-study student if this money was suddenly taken away. These students would then have to find an alternative way to shoulder the cost, which may not be feasible, especially during a time in which many families may already be struggling financially.
To ensure that work-study students still receive the financial support they need through the coronavirus crisis, the University must continue paying work-study funds as long as remote instruction continues. While this means that the University will have to pay salaries for hours that are not actually being completed — essentially giving away money for “free” — its first priority must be to protect its students.
Alternatively, the University could consider eliminating the work-study option temporarily and lowering tuition as a whole. This way, students would still be able to pay for tuition without having to worry about whether or not their jobs will endure the length of the pandemic. This also means that USC would not have to pay money for labor that is not actually being done. 
As the coronavirus crisis continues to evolve, it is not yet clear what the financial future of USC holds. Despite this uncertainty, USC should endeavor to support student workers who are too facing financial uncertainty and make up a valuable part of the student population.

In a difficult and distressing time, USC has stood as a leader for the student body and the Los Angeles community in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Communication from the administration has been frequent and thorough. USC Student Health has provided several resources for both mental and physical health, and the offices of the president and provost have kept students and parents updated on grading policies as well as changes to international and summer programs. The administration’s leadership has also spearheaded the creation of the USC Student Basic Needs Fund and the USC Employee Support Fund to help students and staff financially affected by the pandemic. 
The University has also taken steps to make the online college experience more interactive. The school has set up a virtual career fair and events such as Visions and Voices programming online. Keeping everyone in the USC family updated on the evolving situation, as well as hosting virtual events and activities, embodies the commitment and care the University has for its student body.
On a more tangible scale, the school has also accommodated more than 1,600 students with housing on campus. While the University deserves credit for organizing a contingency plan to support these students, the dedication of the school’s residential and food services staff has been indispensable. 
Beyond student and employee affairs, USC has made an impact on the broader Los Angeles community and the world. Over the next few months, USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign, which focuses on community education and safety, will give local nonprofits $1.3 million in grants. Additionally, USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a college-preparatory program serving more than 1,000 students from local schools annually, has continued its efforts through Zoom and other online formats.
The University has also stepped up in a large way in the medical fight against the virus. The Keck Medicine of USC COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund was created to raise money to obtain medical resources, such as masks, gloves, testing kits and ventilators for USC medical workers and their patients. Through the Keck School, University researchers are studying the virus to help create better public safety measures, as well as develop potential treatments.
The Iovine and Young Academy and School of Architecture have both pitched in as well, using their respective 3D printers to make N-95 equivalent masks and deliver them to Keck Medicine, the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles and the L.A. County+USC Medical Center.
In this time of crisis, USC has done exactly what universities were designed to do: serve society. Over the past month or two, the University has shown its resilience as well as its ability to make a profound impact. 
Not only has the school made considerable efforts to accommodate its students, it has also taken a leading role in the community and the worldwide fight against the coronavirus. Although to an extent it is what should be expected out of a school, it is a reminder of how pragmatic USC is.

President Carol Folt spoke on plans to resume normal University operation, the incoming freshman class and the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic at her first annual State of the University address Wednesday. The event, typically held at Town & Gown, was conducted via Zoom in light of the closure of public-access buildings on campus due to the spread of the virus.
Folt opened by acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the event and recognized medical staff, faculty and essential campus workers that have maintained University programs’ functions throughout the semester. She also praised USC students and alumni for their community involvement throughout the pandemic, citing examples such as vaccine development research at Keck Medicine of USC, efforts to expand coronavirus testing and the Athletic Department’s blood drive for the American Red Cross.
“For 140 years, USC has been part of the fabric of our region and our city, and from the start of the crisis, Trojans joined hands with community-based organizations to support our most vulnerable neighbors,” Folt said.
Lauding the accomplishments of several USC schools and departments over the year since she took office, Folt said the number of top-10, top-20 and leading rankings the University received during the past year constituted a marked increase from the year prior. She also applauded the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Marshall School of Business for their incoming classes’ gender parity and commended the diversity of the admitted Class of 2024.
“Our students continue to say they are coming to USC because it’s the best place for them to explore and pursue their passions, improve communities and become game changers,” Folt said. “Here, they have the chance to work with some of the greatest minds of our times and to get involved in so much.”
Folt discussed USC’s plans for the coming months, announcing that campus housing facilities would remain open through the summer for students unable to return to their permanent residences. 
University administrators are currently considering plans for reopening in the fall. Most classes, even if offered in person, will have virtual options as well, Folt said. She confirmed that students from all academic programs would continue to make normal progress toward their degrees, regardless of the format of classes next semester.
“Our teams are actively exploring options, including delaying the start of on-campus classes by several weeks, retrofitting our facilities for social distancing and pursuing hybrid models that include online and in-person activities in all classes,” Folt said. “We plan to decide about that in the next two months. We appreciate your patience, and we will keep you closely informed.”
According to Folt, the University projects an operational deficit of $300 million to $500 million through June 2021 due to increased expenses and reduced revenue, grants and donations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. USC has responded to the shortfall by reducing pay for top officials, suspending hiring and merit raises and cutting discretionary costs.
Folt emphasized that despite budgetary difficulties, USC would remain committed to affordability and financial aid. She said the University has begun to disburse its $19.3 million CARES Act appropriation and would continue to distribute payments from its newly created emergency funds.
“There is no doubt we will need to do better with less, but I’m convinced we will emerge from this even stronger, with a nimble infrastructure and a culture that takes risks, learns from mistakes and puts people first, all while remaining a leader in research, education and discovery,” Folt said.
Thanking essential workers, trustees and the USC administration for their service, Folt encouraged students to look forward to USC’s future growth, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.
“Above all, we want to make sure that all our students continue to dream big and act boldly,” Folt said. “You are needed more than ever. You have so much to offer, and we’re going to work with you to make your USC experience, rewarding and successful in the face of so much uncertainty.”

My father was a little surprised seeing me up at 4 a.m. He seemed to forget how volatile a college education makes your sleep schedule. I wanted to join him for the first time in years on his daily trip to Saigon Bakery, one of our bakeries located in a Vietnamese neighborhood called Little Saigon in Orange County. I grew up going on these trips with my father, watching him prepare the dough that would become the heart and soul of the bakery as customers began to line up for baguettes early in the morning.
This time the drive was different. It was the first day of California’s stay-at-home order and my first day back home since leaving USC due to the increasing spread of the coronavirus. Despite it being early morning, the usual traffic was gone, as was the line of early customers trying to get Vietnamese coffee and croissants before work. It was an eerie feeling all around the plaza where our bakery was located. 
While my father began his daily bread-making ritual, I realized how easy it was for our bakery to become the next hotspot for an outbreak: Our small interior and open display bakeries coupled with a tight line of customers coming into the store made me realize the necessity for social distancing. So I taped the ground, pushed the spring rolls and straws behind the glass displays and enforced the social distancing restrictions that many businesses were starting to implement in the neighborhood. 
It was strange seeing my second home, usually with a line leading out the door, become a desolate quarantine zone. Undoubtedly, our family business was hurt because of these regulations, as were many other restaurants and stores in the area. Soon masks became the common accessory for both customers and workers, all desperate for bread amid the pandemic. While our bakery did lose customers for the first days of the shelter-in-place order, other restaurants closing and our quick and easy takeout system made our bakery busier than ever. 
But this short breath of relief did not stop all of my family’s worries. The conversation of whether or not we should stay open during the pandemic has shifted to whether or not we should stay open amid the growing worry that our workers or my parents may get sick. I quickly took up the role of the coronavirus specialist for the bakery, regulating social distancing measures and ensuring any point of contact between workers and customers be mitigated to hopefully prevent any exposure. I used the general paranoia that many of us have over the pandemic to make sure everyone who entered the bakery was as safe as possible. 
Coming back from these daily shifts by noon to start classes was definitely rough in the beginning — extremely rough. But with more time to spend with my reduced extracurricular responsibilities, the bakery has become my escape from the uncertainty of the world. I used to despise being stuck in the bakery for hours as a child when I was unable to properly work in the store, and the few trivial tasks I could complete were sweeping the floor or restocking the shelves of soft drinks and Vietnamese desserts. Now, I am finally in a position to begin the sacred practice of dough making. When we were finally in a stable position, both financially and mentally, I was inspired by a post on NextShark, an Asian and Asian American news website, of a banh mi store in Minnesota donating banh mi sandwiches to local hospitals to do the same. 
The donations from our bakery to a couple of local hospitals and Keck Hospital of USC have been one of the few ways my parents and I have tried to show our support to health care workers — people who are guaranteed to be exposed to the virus but still decide to go all in, putting their health and safety aside for others. 
While the coronavirus has canceled my summer internship plans in Sacramento and Maymester in Rome, it has reconnected me to a drifting part of my childhood. I am lucky to have the opportunity to be able to work with my father again, reunited by our father and son business. Despite the raging pandemic in the United States and the world, our bakery remains a cornerstone of the community, delivering fresh bread to people who need it and following the public health guidelines necessary to stop the virus from spreading. While I am ready to come back to USC to have classes and see my professors and peers face-to-face, the quarantine policies are crucial to saving lives. In the meantime, my family and I will continue baking bread to serve the community and those who are fighting to protect us from this disease.

Student Health will launch a study to test students for coronavirus antibodies, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman announced in an email to University administrators and student government Wednesday.
The study will use a randomized sample of 500 to 800 students from different demographics, including U.S. and international students. The stipulations for recruitment to the study include a minimum age of 18 and require students to reside close enough to the University Park Campus to be able to commute to the Engemann Student Health Center to be tested. Both on- and off-campus students may participate if contacted by Student Health. 
Participation in the study is open only by invitation, and the population sample will comprise solely USC students. Student Health professionals will administer the antibody tests at no cost to students, and participants will receive their individual results one to two weeks after participating, Van Orman said. 
“We’re trying to get all the specimens collected in about two weeks,” Van Orman said. “We want to turn the data around pretty quickly because we’re very interested in it from like, ‘How do we plan for next fall based on this information?’”
While the presence of antibodies has not yet been confirmed to indicate immunity, further research may help to ascertain whether contracting the coronavirus precludes an individual from a subsequent infection, Van Orman said. Currently, antibody studies are used to determine the proportion of a population that has been exposed to the virus.
“Many people are hopeful that over time, COVID-19 antibody will mean that someone might be immune to reinfection — we don’t know that yet,” Van Orman said. “We do know it may be an important part of understanding who in our community might be at risk.”
According to Van Orman, the study will help the University better determine the prevalence of coronavirus exposure of different student populations within USC, which will play a role in virus screening recommendations for students in at-risk groups. The study, which will close by May 8, may also influencempact the University’s plans for the return of students to campus and the resumption of in-person classes. 
“We know that during the spring, we had a significant number of students test positive for infection, and we also know that within young adults in particular, infections appear to be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic,” Van Orman said. “We’re very interested in knowing what the seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies is in the student population.”
While several studies on the presence of antibodies have recently been conducted, the Student Health study will focus specifically on college students and their exposure to the coronavirus. The student population has a unique infection pattern because of their constant interactions within both residential and academic settings, Van Orman said.
“We’re trying to understand within a population that tends to circulate with each other, how might it have spread during the spring semester,” she said.
The announcement of the Student Health study comes after the first iteration of a study launched by Price School of Public Policy vice dean Neeraj Sood in partnership with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health earlier this month to test L.A. County residents for the presence of coronavirus antibodies. The preliminary results of the study estimated that between 2.8 and 5.6% of adults in L.A. County have been exposed to the virus and developed antibodies.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate approved an amendment to USG’s bylaws that reinstated annual stipends for assistant directors of departments within the funding, communications and programming branches. 
In February, the former USG Executive Cabinet approved an amendment to USG’s bylaws that eliminated stipends for assistant directors of these branches and raised stipend amounts for students in higher-level positions, including the president and vice president. Assistant directors were not involved in the decision-making process for this change. 
“I was an intern last year, so I knew I wanted to stay in USG and apply to be an [assistant director] because I’d get paid and I could still do work for USG,” said incoming creative services assistant director Gary Wu. “[Not getting a stipend] wasn’t known to a lot of us who were applying.” 
Wu said the cuts to assistant director stipends and the pay raises for higher USG officials felt “like they took [the pay] away from us to give to the directors.” 
“Doing four hours of work a week gets kind of tiring,” Wu said. “I’m super grateful that they kept it because we’re doing a lot of work for the student government, so we do deserve to get paid for our time.” 
Establishing stipends for assistant directors resulted in salary reductions for members of the USG executive team. 
“Everybody on the executive team took a pay cut — the president and vice president took the largest pay cut to make this happen,” said Speaker of the Senate Gabriel Savage. “It took a little bit of deliberation amongst everybody in the executive team … but I think it was the right move. I’m very pleased with how it went. I think that people made their voices heard.” 
The Senate also approved the creation of an intersemester senatorial committee to address student concerns related to the coronavirus. 
Savage worked with President Truman Fritz and Vice President Rose Ritch to create a means to continue advocating for students given the circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic throughout the summer. Issues under the committee’s jurisdiction include ensuring student housing refunds go through and responding to questions regarding the potential resumption of in-person classes this fall. 
“What we know is that this is a dynamic and evolving situation and that we don’t want our hands tied in how we can address any things that come up over the summer,” Savage said. “We don’t know exactly what challenges may present themselves moving forward, but we want to make sure that we have a task force ready to mobilize whenever that might happen.”
Tuesday’s meeting concluded the Undergraduate Student Government’s semester of weekly meetings. The Senate will resume its meetings next fall.

The Class of 2020 is no ordinary graduating class. Its members have borne witness to major change at USC, such as the construction of USC Village, three different University presidents and a multitude of scandals. A virtual commencement ceremony is just one of the unexpected challenges thrown their way as they prepare for life after USC. 
With commencement being held online, students are missing out on the integral college experience of celebrating their success together and saying goodbye to their friends. 
Isabella Hauptman is one of these students. Since she was little,  she knew she wanted to be an epidemiologist. The graduating senior chose USC so she could pursue a progressive degree in applied biostatistics and epidemiology along with an undergraduate degree in cognitive science.
While her journey at USC will continue next year, Hauptman was selected as valedictorian for the Class of 2020 from a pool of qualified students.  Seniors Gavin Kress and Thomas Kim were selected as salutatorians. The online commencement ceremony will take place May 15, and Hauptman does not yet know if she will give the commencement address that valedictorians give each year.
While this wasn’t the graduation ceremony she envisioned, Hauptman remains positive and proud of what she has accomplished during her time at USC. 
“I think it’s really making us question our values and think about our priorities and put things into perspective,” Hauptman said. “While this isn’t necessarily what I had dreamed of [when] graduating college … just trying to stay positive and be proud of ourselves for getting this far is important.”
Being involved with Camp Kesem, a camp for children whose parents have cancer, defined a large part of Hauptman’s time at USC. She joined as a freshman who saw herself among the campers. 
“When I was about 6 years old, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and I remember how scary that felt and how isolating it was for me,” Hauptman said. “I definitely wish [Camp Kesem] was something that I could have been a part of to know that I wasn’t alone and to see and hear the experiences of other kids.”
Much of Hauptman’s other free time has been spent in labs conducting research. She has been working at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles for the past two years in the Biobehavioral Pain Laboratory conducting research and has spent both summers after her sophomore and junior years looking into using virtual reality as a tool to help children undergoing operations manage pain. 
“When I was in middle school, I was diagnosed with a rare pain disorder and so I actually spent time at a children’s hospital up north seeking treatment for my condition,” Hauptman said. “This is also something that I think I could have really benefited from personally just because VR is a really effective tool … to mitigate some of the pain that children feel.”
For Kress, one of the two salutatorians, research has served a similarly integral part of his life during his time at the University. Kress found his home within the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC where he worked on projects such as culturing and testing tissue from surgical samples. While he is currently finishing his undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering, he too will continue at USC for his progressive degree in mechanical engineering. 
“It’s really great because I can go around and I can learn about anything,” Kress said. “There’s biophysicists, chemists, data scientists, tons of people to learn from and I’ve really taken full advantage of that. I’ve learned a ton since I’ve been there.”
Kress believes that gaining this knowledge was the result of immersing himself directly in his subject material through his extracurriculars and research. He started the Vaccination Information Awareness Initiative, a nonprofit focused on vaccine awareness and accessibility, while in high school and wants to combine his engineering experience with the health care field.
“[I want to] bring engineering research and engineering applications directly to the medical profession because that’s kind of rare it happens,” Kress said. “It really takes a lot of time and a lot of difficult collaboration to actually get novel engineering innovation directly to the medical side. It’s important to expedite that process and bridge the gap that exists between engineering and medicine.”
Thomas Kim, the other salutatorian, is graduating with a degree in international relations. Entering USC undecided, Kim said he wasn’t sure what he wanted to study, but after spending fifth through eighth grade in South Korea, he knew he was interested in understanding how countries interact.
“When I came back [to the United States] for high school, I had this different mindset compared to my other peers in high school where the world didn’t just exist in San Diego or within the suburb or within Southern California,” Kim said. 
Kim said that although his focus in the beginning of his college experience was tangible success such as high grades, he has learned along the way that the friendships he has made along with becoming a part of the Trojan Family have truly defined his success. 
“Very honestly, my first two years here, I [believed] college was just high school round two where you just get the highest grades, participate in extracurriculars, just build your resume,” Kim said. “But after that summer [between sophomore and junior year], college became more of, ‘This should be about building relationships and building those support networks.’”
For Kim, finding a place as tenor saxophone in the Trojan Marching Band and taking on leadership positions in international relations fraternity Delta Phi Epsilon have provided him a community in which to thrive. Finding a sense of family helped Kim succeed and he wants to provide a similar environment to others in the Trojan community. 
“Being in leadership positions where I got to interact with far larger and wider groups of [DPE], I feel like I made my mark by keeping that spirit and familial integrity,” Kim said. “Even though the org, by the time I left presidency, grew to 100 people, it still felt as if we were a group of 40 people in terms of how close everyone was with each other.”
Despite facing the additional challenge of graduating amid a pandemic, Kim said he is certain that the entire Class of 2020 is united in shared experience and can tackle any trouble ahead.  
“I have the entire Class of 2020, not just at our school but across the country and the world, where we can rely on each other through these relationships that we build,” Kim said. “I think we will find a way through this. It’s completely unprecedented but if anyone’s going to find out a way to do it, it would be my class.”
With an in-person commencement ceremony to be held at a later date, the graduating seniors believe it is important to celebrate what they have achieved and to be proud of their accomplishments. 
“Our class has gone through so much in the last four years,” Hauptman said. “I really want everyone to still be proud of themselves and to celebrate all of our time here … Even though this isn’t what we expected, I think we should all share and celebrate our successes.”

USC will not provide prorated tuition refunds for the spring semester or upcoming summer sessions, Provost Charles Zukoski announced in a campuswide email Tuesday. He also announced that both summer sessions will be conducted online.
“While this is not the semester any of us envisioned, we are continuing to provide a high-quality education, ensure academic progress towards degree, and offer a robust learning environment,” the email read. “Whether our instructors present their classes in person or online, they bring the same expertise, depth of knowledge, and commitment to their teaching, and students continue to earn credits toward a USC degree.”
The summer sessions were moved online in light of the safer-at-home orders currently in place in California and most other states and the uncertainty regarding when the restrictions will be lifted. Summer courses will use the typical University grading policy, including the unit and deadline restrictions on pass/fail courses.
USC has not yet come to a decision on the status of the fall semester but plans to make an announcement within the next two months, the email read. Several other universities, such as CSU Fullerton and UCLA, have announced they will either require or offer the opportunity for students to take classes remotely this fall.
“We are focused on returning to activities in clinical care and clinical education, research, teaching, learning, and creative and athletic experiences that recognize the risks of the spread of the disease,” the email read. “All of this forward planning is being done with the full recognition that what we do at USC forms the foundation for successful lives and careers, and is the basis of a strong civil society.”
The dean’s list will also be suspended for Spring 2020 to lessen pressure on students amid the transition to online classes and the adjusted grading policy, the email read. 
The email also announced that the University has received $19 million in government funding through the CARES Act, half of which is federally mandated to go toward students who are in need of emergency financial assistance. Students who are undocumented or international or who have not met academic progress requirements for the spring semester will be unable to access these funds and may apply to the USC Student Basic Needs Fund instead, Zukoski wrote. 
“We are disappointed that our international and DACA students, as well as those enrolled in online-only programs, are not covered under the CARES Act,” the email read. “We are working to assist those students in myriad ways, including through the USC Student Basic Needs fund.”

As some universities release their plans for the fall amid the coronavirus pandemic, students from the School of Cinematic Arts took to social media to circulate a petition April 21 calling for the School to pause production classes. 
The petition asked for SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley and Division of Film and Television Production chair Mike Fink to pause the production track should USC decide to continue online in the fall until in-person classes can resume. With over 750 signatures at time of publication, the petition notes that these students will consider taking a leave of absence for the semester if this change fails to be implemented or considered.
But before the coronavirus disrupted the USC community, there was another public health crisis on campus — and more specifically at SCA. 
Early November, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman confirmed to the Daily Trojan that nine students died over the Fall 2019 semester. Two were SCA seniors: John Moore, who was majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, and John Lynch, who was majoring in screenwriting. Both died from accidental overdoses.
On April 27, Van Orman confirmed to the Daily Trojan that three additional online students died over the Spring 2020 semester. According to Van Orman, these students were older than the college student demographic, and the causes of death were different from those in the fall, which she said saw a “cluster effect” in the deaths.
Moore’s and Lynch’s deaths were not isolated incidents at the School. In April 2018, SCA was rocked by the death of screenwriting student Mckenna Martin, who died by suicide. The SCA community — along with the entire USC community — was left “shell-shocked,” said Leo Allanach, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production.
In response to the deaths last semester, SCA partnered with USC Student Health to integrate an expansion of Let’s Talk, a drop-in program for students to seek guidance from mental health counselors in an informal discussion setting. 
According to Dr. Kelly Greco, assistant director of outreach and prevention services at Student Health, the expansion has transitioned to one-on-one counseling with two full-time clinicians at SCA this semester. Amid the pandemic, counseling has continued online.
Aside from counseling, director of student services Marcus Anderson among other faculty and staff has held forums and meetings with students to discuss their concerns. Though most have been emotionally driven, Anderson said in December they started to brainstorm pragmatic changes that they want to make at SCA.
“Conversations now are very practical in nature of what do we need? How can we do that? What is the most effective way to implement change, and how can we do things quickly?” Anderson said. “And then what do we need to do long term? Ultimately, we’re running a long-term approach here because we want to make sure that SCA is a place where students, faculty and staff, everyone can thrive.” 
Despite these efforts, Allanach said the deaths are proof of a systemic issue of failing to address the mental health of students at the School. 
“Until we’re making more of a student movement and student stance, it is so easy for them to say things behind closed doors and agree to certain things and play up these niceties and not do anything,” Allanach said. 
The culture of SCA production
For Allanach, and for many of his classmates, the fall semester of junior year was his most difficult. 
Allanach was taking “Intermediate Production,” a required mid-curriculum course otherwise known as “310” among production students. Notorious for being mentally and emotionally taxing, 310 puts students in trios to produce three films in 15 weeks, rotating them between filmmaking roles so that each can develop skills in producing, shooting, writing and directing their own films. 
The course tested Allanach’s limits. While 310 is a six-unit course, translating to six hours of instruction per week, Allanach found himself in class for 12 hours per week and spending his weekends working on the films. Even though he came into the class with the expectation that he would have to take better care of himself during the course, he said it was nearly impossible to prioritize his well-being.
“It’s tough,” Allanach said. “310 was absolutely the hardest semester for me, and it’s weird seeing almost the repercussions of that and the fallout of that a year later.”
Poor mental health among students is tightly woven into the culture at SCA, but such a culture has been perpetuated by the School itself, said Oona Wuolijoki, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production. When Wuolijoki first came to SCA in 2018, she said Daley didn’t shy away from stressing the rigor of the School when she welcomed new students.
Daley said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that through its curriculum, SCA aims to provide students with a realistic view of the entertainment industry.
“It is a rigorous curriculum,” Daley said. “This is a professional school, and the last thing on Earth we ever want to do is not to give students the education that they need in order to be successful when they leave.”
According to professor Bill Yahraus, who has been the 310 course coordinator for more than 20 years, the class is not a weeder course. The level of stress that comes with the class depends on the student and how much weight they place on it within their overall curriculum, he said.
“This is not that difficult of a course, and you have tons and tons of support,” Yahraus said. “I really try to say to everybody, these [projects] are exercises, so … it’s not designed to be that kind of a course. That doesn’t mean that some students take it very seriously.”
According to Yahraus, amid the pandemic, some work for the second films in 310 went online and has yet to be completed. Students will finish their third films next semester in “The Production and Post-Production Assistant” course, another required course.
Other students such as Dylan Mondschein, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, found that while 310 was tough due to its tight deadlines, she expected its level of rigor. She added that her friends in the program cautioned that she’d need to give up her social life for the course.
“That was a really daunting thing for me,” Mondschein said. “But the amount I learned in that one semester is mind-boggling. I grew more in that semester than I have in any other semester in college, at least creatively.”
Moore, who died in October 2019, was in Allanach’s group but ultimately decided to take a leave of absence for health reasons before they started their second film.
Allanach recalls one weekend shoot about two weeks before Moore’s leave of absence where Moore took frequent trips to the bathroom because he was not feeling well. Allanach asked for Moore to leave and get some rest, reassuring him that he would not get in trouble, but Moore, who was the cinematographer, decided to stay, since class rules prohibit students other than the cinematographer from touching the camera. When Moore later explained the circumstances to the professors, they told the group they should have stopped shooting until Moore was physically able. 
“They kind of push this thing as you have to follow every rule, but then also the most important thing is that it gets made no matter what,” Allanach said, adding that the short deadline frustrated him. “It’s like, OK, we can either have one or the other. We can either have it presented to you, and you can ignore the process, or you can emphasize the process and recognize that the finished product will not be what you want it to be.”
While the group’s professors made arrangements for them to work without Moore by letting them complete only one more film, the two were only allowed to work on their next film while other trios were completing their third films. Additionally, Allanach and his partner were instructed to split Moore’s responsibilities rather than find someone else to help. To help lessen the workload, Allanach brought a friend in to unofficially step in as the producer, but they got into trouble because the faculty wanted the two to complete the film by themselves.
“It was this whole mess of like, I don’t know what you want from us,” he said. “We’re trying to do the best that we can in the circumstances that were given.”
Dave O’Brien, Allanach’s producing professor for 310, declined an interview with the Daily Trojan, but indicated that he and other 310 faculty had been in regular contact with the students to make arrangements that would guide them toward an agreeable outcome. 
There is no way to completely buffer against the realities of a trio losing one of its members, but O’Brien told the Daily Trojan that he believes the faculty responded appropriately. 
“There’s just a big difference in what the faculty see and what the students see even if they try their best to communicate, unless they’re really making an effort to be empathetic of the different circumstances,” Allanach said.
After speaking at an SCA forum in 2018 regarding the school’s structural issues, Allanach said he was pulled into Anderson’s office for a meeting. There, he was advised to consider dropping out of his major. 
Anderson said SCA would never recommend that a student drop a program, but if a student is not happy with their major, he talks with them about whether or not they want to continue pursuing the field. With Anderson’s help, the student can then look into other programs within and outside of SCA they may be interested in transferring into, he said. 
“Our primary concern is the mental health of our students,” Anderson said. “So it’s not a recommendation that they transfer over, it’s more of a sit-down discussion to make sure that the student is comfortable with the program and actually wants to continue it.”
But for some students these forums and talks are simply not enough. Mondschein said SCA should provide more of a nurturing environment where students can feel safe having important conversations with their teachers and build deep relationships with them. 
“People are really afraid to criticize anything because these are people who hold a lot of power, who could change our lives or careers, and so this is not an environment in which people feel necessarily safe to discuss the things that are plaguing them,” Mondschein said. “And I think that’s its biggest downfall.”
The issue of drug use
When it was confirmed by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner that both Moore and Lynch died of accidental overdoses, Nancy Forner, head of the editing track in the production division, believed it was necessary to discuss with her students the issue of using drugs, namely fentanyl, of which traces were found in Moore’s blood.  
“I stopped and took time and I explained to them … there is a drug out there that you might not know about,” Forner said. “And I explained to them the dangers of that … I wanted them to know because not everyone knows these things.”
To Wuolijoki, drug use on campus has been more stigmatized than mental health issues, noting that it is “absolutely insane” that the discussion surrounding addiction has been discussed entirely separately from mental health. She explains that they are “intimately linked.”
Wuolijoki said while most professors have taken drug issues at SCA seriously, she said that during a memorial for Lynch, Daley advised people to not do drugs, which Wuolijoki likened to an attempt of former First Lady Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign in the 1980s. 
“We’re talking about addiction,” she said. “That’s not fixed by some sort of Nancy Reagan shit. Sorry.”
According to Mondschein, self-medication with drugs and alcohol is normal behavior for some students. During her time at SCA, she said she observed young artists often aspiring to embody the personas of the successful artists that came before them, but these artists are often people who have dealt with addiction and mental health issues.
When Mondschein first got to college, she decided to take a break from going to therapy, as she had done in high school. But as her mental health steadily declined her sophomore year, Mondschein sought help from the Engemann Student Health Center, which referred her to an external psychiatrist who she said prescribed her medication that caused her to develop suicidal thoughts and a poor appetite.  
As a result, Mondschein found herself drinking frequently. That year, Mondschein dealt with substance abuse and developed a dependent relationship with alcohol. But when Martin passed away in April 2018, Mondschein, who was close with her, said her death was a wakeup call. She decided to go back to therapy. 
“That was something that only therapy could really change for me, talking about my problems, working through them,” Mondschein said. “[Self-medication is] a valid way of protecting yourself, it’s not like coming from a place of, ‘I want to get addicted to drugs.’ It’s like ‘No, I want to take care of myself, and I don’t know how.’”
Mondschein said there needs to be more conversation surrounding drug and alcohol use — not just in the context of addiction, but rather as a mental health issue, since it is often comorbid with depression, anxiety and other mental health illnesses. 
Anderson said that while there has been conversation around drug use among SCA faculty, there needs to be more of a dialogue throughout the University, since it concerns all staff.
“It’s kind of a delicate balance though because conversations around drugs can very quickly and easily steer into lecturing,” he said. “And that is not the type of conversation that needs to be occurring, and so it’s more of engaging in those individual dialogues with students and having discussions about it.”
Since Martin’s death, Mondschein has served on the board of directors for Mckenna’s Grace, a nonprofit organization in honor of Martin that aims to eliminate suicide on college campuses. The nonprofit is currently developing the Grace App, which will provide students a platform to “both give and receive support and affirmations, as well as access mental health resources,” according to its website.
“By being associated with Mckenna’s Grace, I think it also just kind of inspired me to be very open about my own issues and very candid about mental health,” Mondschein said.
Moving forward
As a 310 professor, Forner said faculty members have well discussed mental health issues, with every meeting dedicated to brainstorming ways to make improvements to SCA’s curriculum while maintaining its rigor. Forner said it’s a difficult balance to achieve.
In Spring 2019, the 310 faculty implemented a change in the way they assign “dailies,” or raw footage students gathered from the prior weekend of shooting. Instead of having students watch each other’s dailies frequently, faculty now requires only the trio whose dailies are to be shown to go to class and get feedback. With this change, Forner said other students can take the extra time to catch up on sleep or do other work.
Forner said she has been like a “mother hawk” to her students, making sure to check in with them frequently. In her years teaching 310, she has had a handful of students who have come to her to talk about their stress and mental health. Forner said she would walk students over to Engemann to meet with counselors and then check in every night to make sure they were eating and getting enough rest. In some cases, students opted to take a leave of absence as Moore did.
“We do this little thing until they’re past the hurdle, and I’ve suggested to other teachers, and other teachers do it — I know they do, I’m not the only one,” Forner said. “The faculty really cares. I mean, we think of these students as our children, and I know that sounds corny … but it’s true.”
Looking ahead, Daley said the School is working with Campus Wellbeing and Education to repurpose the “Reality Starts Here” course every SCA freshman takes to get introduced to the School’s resources into a “life skills” course focused on health and well-being, spearheaded by Anderson and Interim Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Evan Hughes. 
Additionally, the School will offer a new required course on collaboration for production MFA students titled “Collaboration and Creativity,” given the amount of teamwork that is required in SCA and beyond. These courses, which will be offered Fall 2020, will help students get a more realistic and holistic view of the entertainment industry, Daley said.
“You’ll never make a film or a game or a television show not on a team, so I think we want to get some deeper understanding of what it is people really want to do and what their skillset is,” Daley said. 
Additionally, Anderson helped integrate SCA Chats, biweekly sessions for students to drop in and discuss concerns. The sessions are held at different times and days of the week to accommodate students’ schedules, and SCA rotates who is leading the sessions in case some students feel more comfortable speaking to some faculty more than others, Anderson said. Due to coronavirus-related restrictions, Anderson said the School is holding SCA Chats via Zoom.
Students have also been doing their part to bring more attention to the issues they see at SCA. After Lynch’s death in November, a production major published a letter in the Daily Trojan detailing her experiences — and frustration — during her time at the School. 
“We may be hurting right now, but this is an opportunity to make meaningful changes to a program that has lost too many students,” Alyssa Callahan, who graduated in December, wrote. “Cultivating a more supportive culture where students are able to make mistakes and able to step back when necessary is what so many students not only want, but need — and we need it right now.”
That same month, Wuolijoki and a few other students surveyed production students on their mental health. With the responses, Wuolijoki said they created a list of changes they want to see at SCA for Daley, including hiring full-time counselors on campus. 
But due to the pandemic, Wuolijoki said the momentum they had achieved seems to have diminished. With graduation in a few weeks, she said she is afraid that future classes are not going to be as proactive with demanding change because they are more removed from the deaths. 
However, students like Lauren Rothman, a junior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, still plan on further mobilizing the community. For her “Production III, Documentary” course this fall, Rothman is directing “Life on the Line,” a documentary investigating the student deaths at SCA. Although the coronavirus has brought some uncertainty to how production will move forward, Rothman said she and her crew are still motivated.
“We all had this sense of, ‘We can’t just let things move on after this,’” Rothman said. “The second things shifted [due to the coronavirus] … we all kind of admitted that yeah, we’ve lost focus, and I think that kind of was the driving force that everybody needed to ramp it up and come at it even stronger than before.”

With the coronavirus pandemic forcing many to work from home, radio stations across the country have continued to provide content to their listeners remotely, transitioning their high-tech equipment to at-home operations. KUSC, a USC-affiliated classical music radio show, has aimed to provide listeners a series of programs during the pandemic, including its “At Home With …” series, a program aimed at sharing a group of guest artists’ curated music selections and their thoughts behind the pieces, kickstarted by Los Angeles Philharmonic music and artistic director Gustavo Dudamel. 
Reaching out to KUSC, the LA Phil conceived of the idea of a radio program where Dudamel would select and discuss his favorite pieces of inspiring and uplifting music during this time of social distancing and isolation. Since “At Home with Gustavo,” the program has garnered a national and global audience, with the series available on several radio stations including those in Philadelphia, Kansas, Mexico and Spain. 
“For me, and I imagine for a lot of you, music has been the thing that brings people together, even when we are apart,” Dudamel wrote in the LA Phil press release. “It’s important maybe now more than ever that we find ways to connect and find comfort and inspiration. While I can’t perform for you right now, I am excited about a new way that I can share music.”
Brian Lauritzen, KUSC announcer and host of the “At Home With…” series, has interviewed various classical musicians and artists, including Dudamel, since the latter’s conductor debut in 2009. Lauritzen said the new radio show is meant to provide a sense of comfort to listeners, especially during the pandemic, by discussing with Dudamel how his music selections can provide a sense of unity among listeners. 
“That [had] always been the focus of the show is to showcase the unique power that music has to inspire, to uplift, to move us and even when we’re apart, bring us together,” Lauritzen said. 
The program includes eight shows in English and two shows in Spanish. Spanish actress and Dudamel’s wife María Valverde also hosted the Spanish version while Lauritzen announced the music selections in English for non-Spanish-speaking listeners. According to Lauritzen, having the Spanish component of the show was important to Dudamel to involve this community with the show. 
“He’s always been about connecting with the [Latinx] community in Southern California ever since he got here,” Lauritzen said. “He’s just so passionate about the world of classical music being accessible beyond what traditionally people think of in terms of audience for classical music, that this music can reach you no matter who you are, no matter where you come from.”
Alejandra Lopez, a Pomona resident and avid follower of the station for five years, said she was listening to the station during dinner with her family when the program switched to Dudamel’s Spanish broadcast, to her surprise. 
“We were listening to KUSC, and then they said … [Dudamel] was going to be doing a live broadcast in Spanish,” Lopez said. “Literally my family was jumping out of their chair during dinnertime because they said ‘What, in Spanish? Oh my gosh, that’s fabulous, never heard [of that] before!’”
For Lopez, incorporating Spanish into radio stations’ English-formatted shows will not only increase the viewership of the stations but also be inclusive to this prominent population in L.A. 
“Music has no language,” Lopez said. “However, if [listeners] hear someone talking in Spanish and that’s their native language, of course I think they’ll be a little bit more interested … It’s important for people to make a little bit of time and try to reach out to the Spanish-speaking community because they would tune in more …  or if they’re searching on the radio and they heard someone speaking Spanish, [they] would probably stop and listen to it.” 
Greg Gilquist, a California resident of five years, stumbled upon the station during his first few days driving through L.A. traffic. While he said he enjoys the “At Home With…” program and looks forward for the radio show to continue, Gilquist believes the station and its affiliates should expand to allow listeners to share music and the importance it has to them.
“[To be] interactive in a kind of personal way, [this] could be a great thing to keep that going, to hear other people’s stories in addition to [artists] — what music gets them going and feeling back to a better place when things are stressful,” Gilquist said.
Since KUSC is partnering with the LA Phil for the new series, Lauritzen said the program had access to archived concert recordings, including some that have not been released publicly — a new aspect of the show he enjoyed sharing. 
“That was an element to me that was really cool that we get to share something that you can’t hear anywhere else,” Lauritzen said. “That was one of the benefits of working with the LA Phil to make this program happen, and to have the access to these recordings and to be able to share those recordings with the audience is something that I really appreciated.” 
Listening to the “At Home with Dudamel” show during his drive home after a late shift at his architecture firm, Gilquist said he had a different experience than when he usually listens to the classical station. According to Gilquist, the show, which provides a sense of calm after a day at work, instead energized him. 
“Listening to that recording that Dudamel picked out, it was exhilarating — it took me from being a little bit of a blur of work and all of a sudden very much awake,” Gilquist said. “Listening to that, I turned it up a little high and got my heart racing a little bit — maybe not such a great idea [while] driving, but that’s the effect that it had on me.”
Laurtizen said he attributes the show’s success to Dudamel connecting with the audience by sharing personal stories, such as his current home life during the pandemic and his interpretation of musical selections, something that would not be possible in a traditional concert setting. 
“Gustavo’s warmth, his humility, his humanity is something that is unique in people in his position and his level of fame,” Lauritzen said. “[Dudamel] kept saying, ‘I want you to ask more personal questions, I want to share more of my personality with the audience. I don’t just want to just deconstruct these pieces of music, I want to share who I am and how I think about music to the audience.’” 
As KUSC transitions the show to include more artists involved with the LA Phil, with Finnish composer Esa-Pekka Salonen as its next guest to air April 28 through May 1, Lauritzen said his experience with the show and working remotely has provided an opportunity to connect with listeners. 
“You’re not just someone pressing play,” Lauritzen said. “In my case, in the closet of my master bedroom at home, telling stories about the music, being empathetic to the situation that our audience is in. All of that, helping to create a little bit of community, a little bit of togetherness, even while we’re apart — that’s something that I view as a privilege and responsibility.”

A quarter of USC’s student population is international, and yet this community is often underrepresented in the stories that are told at the University. In our special “A Long Way From Home” supplement issue, the Daily Trojan aims to spotlight the perspectives of international students who shape the culture of USC. Find all the stories here.
Living in his off-campus apartment in Los Angeles, Niranjan Kadam has been spending most of his waking hours the last few weeks fervently searching and applying for job opportunities as the semester comes to a close. 
Like other graduating international students, Kadam, a graduate student from India studying engineering management, is facing roadblocks navigating job prospects before graduation May 15. Compared to U.S. students, international students have to take extra steps each year to search for career opportunities. They must turn in forms to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services months in advance to renew or change their visa status and find a job before the three-month deadline to secure employment approaches.
“[Students from the United States] don’t need to worry about whether they can be here legally or not,” said Hongen Ma, a graduate student from China studying applied behavior analysis. “We also have very limited time to make our decisions and think about whether [we] can stay here after graduation … So, I feel, for international students, we have very limited options, so it can be really challenging.”
When international students graduate and stay in the United States to work, they have finite options for work visas. For short term employment — one to three years — they can apply for Optional Practice Training, an application that allows international students to pursue job prospects in their field that the government must approve as an extension of their student visa. 
OPT permits students to work in the United States for 12 months after earning their degree, and graduates from specific STEM fields listed on the USCIS website may apply for a two-year extension of their work.
Before graduating from USC in 2017, Benny Lau, a computer science and business administration major, found a job as a software engineer at a payroll company. But for international students after graduation, employment does not guarantee a stay in the United States. For three years, Lau failed to secure a work visa and, now that his OPT is ending, he will have to pack up his apartment and return home to Hong Kong in July. 
“I’m getting ready to go back home … I feel a combination of anger and disappointment after having spent so much time in the States,” Lau said.
To be allowed to work in the United States, international students start the process by submitting an I-20 request, a form issued by schools that provides information on the student’s visa status, which is later sent to the USCIS office as a part of their OPT application.
But for students like Lau, who want to stay longer than the one-to-three years allowed by OPT, there’s the H-1B visa, which grants graduates up to six more years in the U.S. To qualify, an international worker must be sponsored by their employer, but most U.S. companies are hesitant to take a chance on employees from outside the United States. Since H-1B visas must be applied for by employers, the employing company must bear the cost of petitioning, which ranges from $1,000 to $4,000 depending on the size of the company. 
However, even after petitioning for a visa, there is no guarantee that it will be approved. The chance for selection in the lottery for the 2019-20 season was 32%, according to SGM Law Group, an immigration law firm. Each year, only 65,000 visas are available and awarded via the lottery system. Despite finding sponsors, Lau lost the lottery all three years of his OPT status. 
For some students, even finding a company to sponsor them poses a challenge. 
Napa Aramthanapon, who is originally from Thailand, graduated in 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in communication. She said that the job search process was difficult because employers wouldn’t easily grant interviews to international students.
“A lot of companies ask you right away if you require sponsorship, and you have to be honest, and then that’s a factor in the decision to even get an interview,” Aramthanapon said. 
Aramthanapon ultimately found a job at an education nonprofit in San Francisco, where she worked for her year of OPT.  But the company was unable to sponsor her at the end of the temporary employment period.
International students with degrees in STEM fields can not only extend their employment for two years but are also more likely to be sponsored by employers. H-1B visas are only available to those in specialty occupations who can prove that they possess specific technical skills other American job applicants lack. 
For students like Aramathanapon, who studied humanities, this limits job prospects even more. As a result, she decided to go to graduate school at the University of Washington to extend her time in the United States. 
“Without grad school, there was pretty much no way for me to stay longer than a year,” Aramathanapon said. “It seemed like grad school or leave.”
Ma plans to extend his student visa by applying to the data science certificate program at UCLA to increase his prospects of staying in the United States instead of looking for job opportunities after graduation. With this plan, Ma hopes to give himself optimal time to search for work in the future and apply to a psychology doctorate program in the United States, a path that would be difficult to pursue if he returned to his home country after graduation, especially considering current coronavirus travel restrictions. 
“If I can graduate in May, I can either stay here or go back to China, but since I plan to apply for a PhD, I definitely had to make sure [that after] graduation, I can stay here legally,” Ma said. “That’s why I [made the] decision to apply for [the UCLA program] so I can be here for another one or two years … During time staying here, I can also probably look at another job and apply for a new OPT.”
The need to enroll in school to stay in the United States puts a financial burden on international students, who already feel they have to rack up more and higher degrees to fare better in the U.S. job market. H-1B lotteries favor those with master’s degrees, meaning that going through that extra phase of schooling doubles one’s chance of being selected. 
Aramathanpon said that while she found help with interviewing and resume writing at the Office of International Services and the USC Career Center, she ultimately felt overwhelmed during the job search. 
“I remember feeling really lost.” she said. “I knew there’s OIS and then there’s career fairs, but I didn’t really know how to piece it together.” 
Jennifer Kim, director of employment relations and research at the Career Center, acknowledged the many hurdles international students face in navigating the job market. She said students should begin their job search as early as possible to cultivate an edge before graduation. 
“From day one, our students need to work with us, come see us, utilize our resources, work with OIS [and] work with the school-based, more specialized career services offices because they’re really the experts,” Kim said.
The Career Center began hosting an international student career fair in 2017 to help students find employers that sponsor visas. Companies that have attended past fairs include Amazon, Adobe and CBS Interactive. 
Kim said international students should try not to get discouraged during the job search, as they are valuable assets to U.S. companies.
“Our international students are uniquely positioned to offer their cultural diversity, their language skills, their unique perspective,” Kim said. “They came to the States, and they’ve had to acclimate to a new culture and a new country, so they’re very adaptable.” 
In 2017, President Donald Trump and his administration signed an executive order that encouraged employers to “hire American.”  Since then, the USCIS has made the OPT and H-1B application process more difficult for international students by imposing more restrictive guidelines.
“During the past couple of years, we have seen more instances of denied OPT applications due to stringent enforcement of application rules and eligibility requirements,” said Tony Tambascia, executive director of OIS, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Some of these denials were for seemingly minor technical errors made by applicants in the submission process, so we’re strongly advising that it’s more important than ever to follow all instructions exactly as stated when preparing and submitting their application.”
According to a 2019 National Foundation for American Policy analysis, the denial rates for H-1B petitions increased to 24% in 2019 from 6% in 2015, partially due to USCIS requesting more information, including requiring guaranteed work assignments, from a rising number of employers. 
An added challenge facing international students this semester is the spread of coronavirus that has impeded job prospects. 
While the process for applying for OPT status remains the same despite the pandemic, USCIS still requires students to be physically present in the United States to be eligible to apply, making it difficult for students who have since returned home.
Like other graduating students, international students have also lost out on on-campus networking events and are finding that companies are reluctant to hire new employees amid the pandemic.
Kadam, who started his job search last semester, said he has actively been applying to as many job positions as he can find online and communicating with users on LinkedIn in an attempt to mimic the networking opportunities that would have been available on campus had the semester continued in person. 
Even with these efforts, Kadam has had little luck securing a job after graduation. 
“Initially, it was difficult to get a job for my major, but now with this pandemic it’s gotten worse because now so many companies that have been hiring … are currently laying off or holding up positions that were open,” Kadam said. 
Kadam said he believes OIS has been extremely helpful, providing timely updates on the process of I-20s. A large portion of the problem is USCIS itself: Many international students are still waiting for a reply informing them of when applications will be processed. Kadam, who has listed a June 10 work start date on his OPT application, is unsure of when he will receive approval. 
“Companies are also asking me, ‘[What] is the earliest start date you can give us?,’ [and] I’m like, ‘I’m graduating in May, but I can’t start till June 10,” Kadam said. “But given this situation, I don’t even know if I’ll be able to start on June 10.”
With classes moved to a remote format to enforce social distancing and quarantine guidelines, many students, including 2019 graduate Linda Chen, have noticed a backlog in receiving necessary forms from OIS to complete visa applications.
“I gave them the material I wanted them to sign and bring back to me, but it’s taking over four weeks for them to get back to me,” Chen said. “They reply by email pretty quickly [saying] ‘We got your message … we’re processing based on the urgency of it.’”
With USCIS policies remaining unchanged, USC is also awaiting a statement from the immigration agency regarding whether there will be issues in processing visa forms during this time.
 In the meantime, international students are forced to play the waiting game — as the pandemic-focused government lulls in its response to student visas, students remain unsure of how their future will unfold.
“USC, along with other universities and major national associations, is asking USCIS and other government agencies for more flexible policies on OPT during this emergency,” Tambascia said. “If any changes are announced, we’ll share this information with the international student community as soon as we have it.”
Bella Marten, a second-year graduate student from Germany studying strategic public relations, said the coronavirus places added pressure on international students. Marten, who applied for her Optional Practice Training through the Office of International Services in February and who is graduating this year, said she hopes the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services will relax OPT regulations, which prohibit more than 90 days of unemployment, during the economic downturn. 
“I think international students should have the same chance [in the job search] because we also now don’t have the equal opportunity anymore to get our work visa or OPT,” Marten said.
 Marten is unsure if she will be able to remain in the U.S. post-OPT status. She said that it’s difficult to accept that she may have to return home after living in the United States for seven years. 
“I get one year to work in the U.S., and likely nobody else will hire me after or sponsor my visa after,” Marten said. “And then after my six years of work, I will have to go back to Germany and nothing applies really, anything that I have worked for. It will have to be all translated.”
Rio Funaki, a senior majoring in linguistics, finds herself in a different situation compared to most international students because she already secured a job in Tokyo as an assistant associate at Bain & Company, a strategy consulting company, in September. Although she considered an offer from a Los Angeles company, the lottery visa process deterred her from considering the position since the company would have required her to work in their Japan office for one to two years before transferring to an office in the United States if she could not obtain the visa.
 Having set her mind on her work in Japan, Funaki was initially nervous about whether her employer would terminate her upcoming position, but the company was quick to reassure her that she would still be employed.
 Even so, Funaki acknowledged that she will likely be working remotely from her home country of Singapore for the duration of her employment if social distancing guidelines continue. Although it may not affect her line of work, Funaki said she’s concerned that the transition back into the office setting will be difficult after months of working online. 
“I’m looking forward to being in the office, meet-ing [my coworkers], interacting with [them] casual-ly and just being motivated by [them], but I feel like that’s going to be a bit harder when we work remotely,” Funaki said.
Although she hasn’t personally experienced any discrimination from her peers at USC arising from pandemic fears, Funaki said she’s concerned as to whether her experience will change once she starts her job.
“I might feel a little bit more vulnerable, a little bit more conscious about my race and my backgrounds, but I want to take that as a learning opportunity to kind of grow,” Funaki said.
Yi Yang, a graduate student studying applied behavior analysis, is also facing an employment concern. An employee at Trojans with Autism, Yang will continue working at the company for three months before traveling overseas to pursue a doctoral program in psychology at the University of Edinburgh. With current delays in receiving Optional Practice Training documents from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, her current employment has been temporarily cut short. “[The company does] not have the ability to have me … during this period of time because [they are] also suffering from financial problems,” Yang said. “I have to temporarily resign from my company, until I get OPT approval from the government; then I will go back to work for the company again.” 
After submitting her I-20 request to USC in March and being asked to resubmit the request in early April because of missing documentation, Yang received her I-20 in mid-April and quickly mailed the form and required documents to USCIS for her OPT application. Still waiting for approval, Yang doesn’t expect to receive the work visa until June. Although Yang is not too worried about the financial loss from leaving her job, since her family in China is supporting her during this time, she said she believes that international students are not the only group vulnerable during this time, with economic insecurity occurring at a global scale. “I think people all over the world have problems finding jobs and have financial problems to some degree,” Yang said. “I think we don’t always have to think of our international students as a vulnerable part of this population.”
A previous version of this article misspelled Yi Yang’s last name and incorrectly identified her doctoral program. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

A quarter of USC’s student population is international, and yet this community is often underrepresented in the stories that are told at the University. In our special “A Long Way From Home” supplement issue, the Daily Trojan aims to spotlight the perspectives of international students who shape the culture of USC. Find all the stories here.
When people think of Greek life, the first things that come to mind are often humiliating stories about hazing and pledging rituals, hard partying and superficiality. While some or all of these may be present in different organizations, students have said Greek life also provides college students, especially international students, an opportunity to feel at home and find community.
Students often struggle as they’re thrust into new routines in a new city, state or country and have to navigate their academic and social lives in an unfamiliar context. It can be particularly challenging for international students, who are not only arriving in a different country but are often met with cultural differences and new traditions. To find a sense of belonging, many international students look toward Greek life.
Carlota Rodriguez-Benito, a 2019 graduate, moved every two or three years throughout her childhood, growing up in North America, Europe and South America. After finishing high school in Mexico City, Rodriguez-Benito attended USC, where she graduated with bachelor’s degrees in Russian, French and international relations. 
Although moving around made it quite difficult for her to find a single place to call home, Rodriguez-Benito said she felt included at USC through the friends she made in the Delta Gamma sorority. However, she explained that joining Greek life is a different adjustment process for international students given all the cultural differences.
“As an international student, I think it’s hard at first to grasp the tradition part of sororities,” Rodriguez-Benito said. “Anywhere you move, anywhere you are, you need to be open-minded about everything, and I think that is a good way to incorporate yourself in a different culture when you’re not from it.” 
After participating in the various rituals that come with rushing and pledging, Rodriguez-Benito bonded with the other students she met and created memories that have lasted beyond her time at USC.
“Most of my memories at USC — studying in the library, going on trips, having social events and just going through life and through big changes in life — have been with these girls,” Rodriguez-Benito said. “[You] meet a ton of people that can then in the future be your business partners, your best friends, your bridesmaids, your child’s godmother.”
Rodriguez-Benito also got involved with Expat Society, a nationwide network for international students, during her freshman year and eventually became the director of recruitment and an adviser to the strategy team. Expat Society aims to build a community based on members’ international connections and experiences, according to the organization’s website. On college campuses, Expat Society’s group activities include art gallery visits, biking excursions and road trips, as well as parties. 
Through Expat Society, Rodriguez-Benito has formed friendships with people from all over Asia, Europe, Latin America and the United States. As part of a community of students bound together by their international experiences, she felt comfortable and, once again, at home.
“It was a very good getaway at times when I needed that connection with people that had an upbringing  more like mine,” Rodriguez-Benito said. 
She met people from different backgrounds, cultures and majors, yet she fondly recalls how she and the friends she made had such similar values and lifestyles that made them feel like family.
However, joining Greek life doesn’t provide all international students with the same kind of bonding and comfort that Rodriguez-Benito experienced. For Kasvi Malhotra, a sophomore from India majoring in communication, it was quite the opposite. 
Last year, Malhotra rushed for Delta Omicron Zeta, a professional leadership fraternity, in hopes of finding a diverse community where she could meet other international students and expand her professional network. However, after pledging, Malhotra found it hard to connect with other people and find the community she was looking for. 
“[Greek life organizations] need to have more international students,” Malhotra said. 
Malhotra said the organization lacked opportunities for international students to connect with each other organically rather than through the assigned task-based events, such as dancing in the middle of Ronald Tutor Campus Center or wearing shirts with funny quotes on them. She said the fraternity would benefit from creating direct opportunities for international students to freely connect with one another through a forum or space where they could get to know each other. 
Malhotra also expressed disappointment in the lack of activities that she was able to participate in during her time in DOZ. When she joined, she expected having an opportunity to get involved in volunteer work or philanthropic events, but she said that wasn’t the case. After a while, she found herself feeling disconnected from the organization, an issue that eventually led to her leaving. 
“A lot of Greek life is kind of centered around your first semester in Greek life, where people are super connected and you’re doing a lot of tasks, but after that … once you’re an active member, you’re not really doing anything,” Malhotra said. “There’s no way for you to actively participate, in my opinion.” 
Although Malhotra’s experience in Greek life fell flat after her first semester, some international students have been able to find a lifelong family through their organization, like Rodriguez-Benito.
Luciana Suero, a junior from Peru majoring in communication, transferred to USC from Santa Monica College in the spring semester of her sophomore year. She decided to join the Alpha Delta Pi sorority and the Delta Kappa Alpha film fraternity, which brings together students with various cinematic interests.
As a transfer student, Suero said she felt behind in terms of finding friends. The relationships she formed in class often felt superficial because she didn’t spend time with those friends outside of class, so Suero turned to Greek life as an alternative method of feeling connected to people at school.
Most of my memories at USC — studying in the
library, going on trips, having social events and
just going through life and through big changes
— have been with these girls … [You] meet a
ton of people that can then in the future be
your business partners, your best friends, your
bridesmaids or your child’s godmother.
While she felt a bit out of place navigating the Greek life culture at first, she eventually adapted and was able to find her people. 
“I came here alone,” Suero said. “I don’t have my family members here in the States, so these girls, the sisters that I have now, are literally my family, and that’s something that I don’t think I could find as a student without joining ADPi or DKA.” 
In DKA, Suero was able to meet people who shared her passion for film while at ADPi, she had the opportunity to be involved in more social events and volunteer work, by fundraising for charities such as the Ronald McDonald House by selling pizza or clothes and holding soccer tournaments.
Despite its flaws, Greek life has guided many international students in discovering new sources of comfort and security.
“I remember some days just being sad and missing my family, and one of my [sorority sisters], came back home and brought me kombucha and cookies,” Suero said. “She sat down with me, listened to me and comforted me, and it felt like I was with my family. Every time I’m with them, it feels like I’m with my family.” 
That sense of community and belonging is something Suero expects to hold on to for a long time. For international students, Greek life has the potential to provide a chosen family and support away from home.
“You end up in a house where people have similar values, similar hobbies, similar perspectives on life to yours and that’s what I love about it,” she said. “I think the people here are my people, and we will be friends forever.”

A quarter of USC’s student population is international, and yet this community is often underrepresented in the stories that are told at the University. In our special “A Long Way From Home” supplement issue, the Daily Trojan aims to spotlight the perspectives of international students who shape the culture of USC. Find all the stories here.
For junior Maddy Ledger, it was learning how to navigate the health care system and finding out that Target sold groceries in addition to furniture and clothing. For sophomore Julia Leb, it was adapting to the pressure of U.S. college culture and adjusting to the “stupid funny” humor that replaced the abrasive jokes she was accustomed to. For senior Tia Razafy, it was getting used to the lack of diversity among the student body and coming to terms with the idea of spending holidays alone on campus.
Ledger, Leb and Razafy, along with many other international students who made the decision to pursue their studies at USC, found the transition strange at some points and difficult at others. They’ve learned to adapt to new norms and a college culture distinct in its social and academic values, and that shared experience is something that has made the international community at the University tight-knit, despite the wide range of backgrounds. 
USC prides itself on its global diversity. It is surpassed only by New York University in the 2019 Institute of International Education survey for the size of its international student population, which makes up nearly a quarter of the student body. The incoming freshman class hails from 96 countries, with large representation from China, India, South Korea, Canada and Mexico.
For Razafy, who is majoring in global health and public health and hails from Madagascar, arriving at USC and living outside of the African continent for the first time was a massive culture shock.
Razafy encountered adjustments she didn’t expect, even though globe-trotting was nothing new for her since she grew up living in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Senegal and attended international schools since the second grade. She and her classmates were expected to go through American school and then attend a university in the United Kingdom, Canada or the United States, but the lack of a diverse student body and living so far from home made it difficult for Razafy to adjust to USC at first. 
“Although I was surrounded by American teachers growing up, it was my first time being in such a homogenous environment,” Razafy said. 
Despite USC’s emphasis on supporting its international student population by tailoring specific orientations and programming to them, Leb said institutional help only goes so far when adjusting to a new environment. 
As an international student and the first in her family to attend college, it was challenging for her to be in a new place away from her home in Canada during her first semester. Moving into her dorm in August 2018 was Leb’s first taste of Los Angeles and her first time witnessing campus life.
“Honestly, I don’t know what I was expecting,
but I wasn’t expecting it to be super rough,
and it ended up being super rough.”
“I think part of that is that I didn’t have anyone telling me, you know, ‘This might be really hard at first, but then it’s gonna get really fun,’ or ‘You might experience culture shock, even in America, even though America and Canada seem to be so similar,’” said Leb, who is majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “Honestly, I don’t know what I was expecting, but I wasn’t expecting it to be super rough, and it ended up being super rough.”
Though the language was the same, along with the clothing styles and media consumption, there were references Leb didn’t understand and a large divide in how students had grown up academically. While Leb didn’t feel strong university pressure from her school until she started taking government exams in the 10th grade, many of her American peers at USC had been planning for college their whole lives.
“All these Americans came to college, hit the ground running on a mission to accomplish what they knew to be what you’re going to college for,” Leb said. “Like, what is the college experience? What friends do you have to make? What things do you have to do? What are [the] bucket list things of college freshman year?”
For Ledger, who is from Australia, having an international roommate freshman year helped smoothen the transition. With her British roommate, Ledger navigated U.S. college culture as she rushed Greek life in Fall 2017 and observed fellow U.S. classmates experience drinking for the first time, something they had both already been through in their own countries, where the legal drinking age is 18.
“By the time you get to college, you’ve kind of had your crazy times,” said Ledger, who is majoring in architectural studies. “We definitely noticed there was a disconnect between a lot of the other kids that were in that, especially in Greek life, and us. So we just kind of had each other, and I’m really glad that we did because it made our adjustments much easier.”
However, some international students encounter the transition period earlier.
Junior Ashley Lyu and sophomore Pria Koll both attended boarding high school in the United States; because they primarily dealt with adjusting to U.S. culture then, the transition to USC was much smoother.
Lyu, a junior majoring in public relations, moved to Ohio from China when she was 15, driven to take advantage of educational resources unavailable in her hometown such as robust SAT preparation and a wide range of AP classes. But new resources were accompanied by new challenges.
“When I was in high school, I had a lot of trouble making friends because … I wasn’t able to have a proper conversation with anyone,” Lyu said. 
Socializing looks very different from culture to culture, and people who have their first experience abroad at USC often encounter sociolinguistic barriers that prevent them from feeling at home, Lyu said.
That’s how Koll first felt when she started high school. She was thrown off by the individualistic nature of her new environment, accustomed to the collectivist culture in her home country of Japan. 
Holidays [make you realize] you’re an
international student, when everyone
leaves and then you just end up being the
only one on campus.
“Whether it’s in the classroom or I don’t know, with my society or whatever it is, I feel like I always just try and stay conscious of the other people’s feelings and just do whatever I can in order to not only benefit me but benefit the group,” Koll said. “I feel like I just noticed that a lot of, I don’t know, just the West in general is just very one-track minded, [the] one goal is to benefit myself.”
While some international students already felt at home in America when they arrived at USC, for others, a wave of culture shock accompanied their transition to college. Some said they identified exclusively with those from the same country or background, while others felt a sense of community with the international student population at large.
“Kids at USC bond a lot, not necessarily over being from the same country, but from not being from America,” Leb said.
Under immigration law, some international students are citizens, while others are permanent residents or temporary residents with student visas. According to the Office of Admission, an international student is any noncitizen who applies to USC. However, this narrow definition does not capture the full scope of international identity and how that might differ from one student to the next. 
Ledger, who is a U.S. citizen because her mother is American, was born in the U.K. and grew up in Australia. She has family in the United States and has visited numerous times on vacation but has never lived or spent an extended amount of time here.
“Going on holiday and spending a month there is very different than living there and getting your everyday life sorted out,” Ledger said. “It was a huge adjustment, just little things like how do I go to the doctor — tiny things that you’re so used to at home, but it’s just different.”
Though being an international student never explicitly defined her college experience, Razafy said her expat status feels more salient as a senior: While American peers are easing through the transition from graduation to working life, international students are confronted with a litany of bureaucratic and immigration-related obstacles if they want to work in the country. 
Because of high costs, distance from home and the possibility of having to reapply for a student visa if she leaves, Razafy elected to stay in the United States until she graduates. While her parents have come to see her in California, she explained it can be tough to watch her friends visit their loved ones so frequently. 
“Holidays [make you realize] you’re an international student, when everyone leaves and then you just end up being the only one on campus,” Razafy said.
Razafy is not the only international student dealing with the stress brought on by the process of acquiring and maintaining a student visa. Depending on the region from which one applies, one’s student visa might be usable for multiple entries while others may require the student to reapply for a visa in their home country after a single entry.
It was a huge adjustment, just little things
like how do I go to the doctor — tiny things
that you’re so used to at home, but it’s just
different.
Of the three different visas available to international students entering the U.S., the F-1 visa is by far the most ubiquitous and popular, as it provides students with the opportunity to work while they study.  Depending on the immigration laws at play, students may elect to remain in the U.S. throughout their undergraduate education or to travel back and forth.
Outside of differences in the education system and navigating the visa process, international students are also left to manage the costs of USC’s private education, which exceeds $77,000 in estimated cost of attendance following years of steady increase. Need-based financial aid doesn’t apply to international students, meaning they must navigate the price of higher education largely on their own. 
The Office of Admission typically points students to merit scholarships, Undergraduate Admission director Lisa Rhone said. International students are eligible for USC’s merit scholarships along with some scholarships provided by individual departments that are given directly to students in the form of monthly stipends.
Through the Office of International Services, University programming and student- and alumni-led organizations, USC works to guide its international student community through life on campus and beyond, Rhone said.
Students go to OIS when they have visa- or work-related inquiries. The office is also a key player in international recruitment and the architect of events and programs designed to strengthen the sense of community among the international student body. While some international students may be more or less involved with the office depending on their specific needs, every international student interacts with OIS over the course of their studies.
Abroad, USC Global Offices and local alumni associations keep the Trojan family strong, Rhone said. The University opened its ninth office in London in 2018, but before then the region’s alumni club had been active, hosting workshops and meetup events to build the USC community. 
Just as individuals differ in the extent to which they identify as an international student, they also take on a variety of approaches when adjusting to life at USC.
For Lyu, student-led organizations such as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association are among the most effective resources for helping international students feel at home. USC’s large international student community and Los Angeles’ diverse population, she explained, mean that there is a place for everyone to feel comfortable.
“I feel like overall, it’s easy to find one’s own place here,” Lyu said.
USC harbors myriad clubs and organizations tailored to bringing students of similar backgrounds together, including the Armenian Students’ Association, the Italian Club and the Korean Business Student Organization.
Under the Undergraduate Student Government, the International Student Assembly hosts career workshops and informational sessions to teach students how to navigate feats such as getting a U.S. driver’s license and understanding the rules of football. The organization also hosts the annual Globefest, which is open to the entire USC community and showcases food, traditions and performances from different countries.
Lyu said strong connections like these are what has made the international community at USC feel like home.
“I feel like it’s easier to find your place here,” she said. “Like, no matter if you want to be more ‘Americanized,’ or if you still want to stay within your culture, there’s always a group here.”

USG’s Guide for Undocumented Students
The college landscape is an uneven playing field. With nearly 100,000 undocumented high school graduates every year, the vast number of undocumented students preparing for college will have to transition without the same access to financial aid and scholarships as many other students. 
However, undocumented students are not entirely excluded from scholarships — the Undergraduate Student Government created a resource list for such students, which include scholarships for undocumented students such as the Los Hermanos de Stanford Scholarship and the La Unidad Latina Foundation Scholarship (specifically for Latinx students). 
The guide also lists specific search engines for finding scholarships, including the Act on a Dream’s database of national scholarships for DACA students. The Salvadoran American Leadership and Educational Fund also provides scholarships for undocumented students, focusing on those with Central American and Latinx backgrounds.
Interstride 
Interstride is a career services page that has partnered with USC and other higher education institutions throughout the country to help graduating international students in their career search. 
Interstride’s Visa Insights feature allows students to look up which employers have sponsored H-1B visas in the past. The Country Insights tool provides descriptions of the economic states of countries across the globe and links to important information including health recommendations, cost of living guides and job postings.
Graduates who aren’t sure what country they want to live in yet can use the Jobs tool, which searches for opportunities at H1-B sponsoring employers both in the United States and internationally. Interstride also provides advice from its employees on job search strategies and posts frequent webinars for students looking to enter any professional area, with topics ranging from job search optimization by country to education on how to begin a startup company.
Students can find the link to Interstride on the “Explore Resources for International Students” page on the University’s Career Center website.
International Student Careers
On USC’s Career Center website, International Student Careers provides guidance to international students hoping to work in the United States. The site hosts similar resources on H-1B-friendly companies to Interstride, including a tool that outlines the best global cities for tech jobs. For those frustrated with H-1B, ISC has a number of educational blog posts that explain the processes that help students get jobs step-by-step.
One such post is a guide to finding jobs abroad, giving students a defined checklist of goals to accomplish on their search that will make them more attractive to potential employers. This checklist style is replicated in other posts that describe how to stand out at an international career fair, how to write an American CV and how to ace an informational interview.
In addition, students who subscribe to International Student Careers’ free newsletter receive the International Student Job Search Guide, a 33-page document that gives aspiring professionals a strong base for their job search, including two sections that explain H-1B in extensive detail.
USC Cultural Assemblies
Joining communities of students with similar experiences offers an intimate way to build a second home. The International Student Assembly is a group for students from all countries and backgrounds and hosts events such as Global Cultural Month, Globefest and other activities. Students can also join cultural assemblies with more specific demographics, such as the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and Latinx Student Assembly.
Edupass – International Student Loan Finder
Navigating which loans are available can be a daunting task for international students. The International Student Loan Finder on edupass.org, a site dedicated to informing international students in the United States about financial resources available to them, allows students to learn about a variety of educational loans. After the student inputs whether they are a U.S. citizen, have a U.S. cosigner and other information related to their degree, the International Student Loan Finder provides a list of loans the student qualifies for.
International Scholarships 
Attending universities in the United States can be very expensive — finding relevant scholarships can be crucial to affording higher education. Internationalscholarships.com provides a comprehensive list of scholarships international students can qualify for in addition to grants and loans. Students can use the site to discover more than 1,600 scholarships, which can then be filtered to find major-specific scholarships.
The Institute of International Education
The Institute of International Education is a multifunctional organization that finds many ways to accomplish its mission statement, which is “to help people and organizations leverage the power of international education to thrive in today’s interconnected world.” Its top service is managing global scholarship programs, but it also uses its vast network of 1,600 higher education institutions to connect members across the world. 
The Institute of International Education’s website connects students to potential opportunities, including fellowships and internships in countries abroad. The website also publishes news and studies on developments that impact international students and launched a fund earlier this month to provide $1 million to aid international students affected by the coronavirus.
NAFSA’s Financial Aid for International Students page
The National Association of Foreign Student Advisors’ sole mission isn’t focused on assisting international students, but its page for international student financial aid is useful. Financial aid is scarce for international students, so NAFSA designed a page that provides information on many common financial concerns and links to sites that specialize in those areas.
The site outlines many methods of funding one’s education, with links to pages that provide scholarships, grants and loans. There’s also a section on tax credit, providing students with the resources to find out when they are tax-exempt.
NAFSA also provides guides for international students to educate them about the costs of going to school in the United States and to help them organize their spending. The glossary of financial aid terms defines any potentially confusing wording that students may encounter on their paperwork, while the simple budget spreadsheet breaks down everything a student will need to spend money on.

A quarter of USC’s student population is international, and yet this community is often underrepresented in the stories that are told at the University. In our special “A Long Way From Home” supplement issue, the Daily Trojan aims to spotlight the perspectives of international students who shape the culture of USC. Find all the stories here.
Before assuming the position of head coach last year, Marko Pintaric had already spent 18 years dedicated to the development of USC’s water polo program. While his transition from associate to head coach brought the stability and guidance the men’s and women’s teams needed in the sudden shift of leadership following the involvement of former coach Jovan Vavic in the college admissions scandal, Pintaric had always provided that sort of direction and mentorship to his international athletes. 
Pintaric made the choice to stay with the program after his successful stint as a student-athlete. He transferred to USC from the University of Zagreb, located in the heart of Croatia’s capital, after playing for the Croatian Junior National Team from 1989 to 1994. Leaving his home — which has an extensive appreciation for water polo and encourages talented young players to skip college to go pro — was not the easiest transition, but it paid off, he said. 
“I liked my story, I loved my experience,” Pintaric said. “I did have a culture shock at first, but my team helped me greatly and I tried to turn those positive experiences and kind of teach the incoming freshmen, especially international students, what I went through. You know, bad experiences [and], in my case, more good experiences, hardships and all that.”
Pintaric was in a good position to get playing time with the recruiting efforts of Vavic, who became an assistant coach at USC in 1992 and took over the program from John Williams in 1999. After competing on the international stage as a member of a four-time national championship-winning club in the former Yugoslavia, Vavic was prepared to start building up the international talent that USC is now known for drawing. 
In two seasons as a starter, Pintaric racked up 103 career goals, with 59 in his 1997 season alone. He then earned National Player of the Year in 1998 for his part on the NCAA Championship team. Pintaric credits the success of his team — and the generations of USC teams to follow — to the different kinds of talent that are welcomed to the University, both international and domestic. 
“It’s about creating a good team atmosphere and for everybody to feel welcome and that’s what we’re trying to provide: trying to treat every player the same,” Pintaric said. “My experience as being a foreign student-athlete and competing [is], in my opinion, very valuable because I can relate to them because I know what they went through.”
While Pintaric has compiled game plans and techniques he learned from playing in Croatia for his players at USC to incorporate, both he and associate head coach Casey Moon recognize the diverse playing styles that have come from different international players on the roster. 
“In regards to water polo, just their international experience, they get to play top-notch water polo against the best players in the world,” Moon said of the unique contribution international players make when deciding to play at USC. “Especially in three of the countries — in Holland, in Spain, in Australia — water polo is so up-and-coming, and they have such a big, big pool of athletes that they are obviously competing against. This is [an] invaluable experience that they get to bring and show.”
Senior utility Maud Megens, sophomore driver Alejandra Aznar and sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns represent the water polo culture of the countries listed by Moon, respectively. They attempted to make their run for the 2020 Summer Olympics before the Games were postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
You always feel that you have to give
something back to these men and
women because they’re trying so hard
to compete not only for this University,
but for their own countries as well.
Despite the Games being moved back, Aznar was more than appreciative of the support that Pintaric and Moon provided for her to get the training experience necessary to compete for Spain at the highest level.
“It’s hard but I’m very grateful to have it,” Aznar said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It will be a lifetime learning and worth it. [It’s] one of the reasons that makes it attractive, being able to combine both and having people around helping to achieve academic and sports goals.”
Kearns also said Pintaric’s coaching has allowed her to develop a more refined game style that has given her an advantage when playing with the Australian national team.
“It’s a lot more structured in the U.S. — I had never been exposed to the amount of thinking and studying required for each and every game,” Kearns stated in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Back home we would just grit it out till the final whistle, but in the collegiate system you need to have every team and its players’ tendencies memorised to be successful.”
On the men’s side, last season boasted the talents of redshirt junior utility Luka Karaman, junior driver Jacob Mercep and senior driver Marin Dasic, the latter two of whom were members of the Croatian Junior National Team and made appearances at the FINA Junior World Championships. 
Dasic said the international experience both Pintaric and former head coach Vavic displayed was what solidified his decision to attend the University.
“I think it was the coaches — I would say I knew I wanted to play [for] someone who has a similar background [in] water polo as me,” Dasic said. “And I think there was no better combination than Jovan and Pinta to be a part of here in [the] U.S. … And I actually did not think about going anywhere else. I did talk a little bit with some coaches, but I knew I wanted to end up here because of them. And I think that was my good chance to come here and continue playing good water polo as I always wanted.”
The dedication and thought that goes into a decision like committing to play at USC, especially when it might mean giving up a spot on a professional team for four years or more, is not something that the coaches take lightly. 
“You always feel that you have to give something back to these men and women because they’re trying so hard to compete not only for this University, but for their own countries as well,” Moon said. “And they need to balance [a lot] — so much is on their plate.” 
Pintaric also factors in the pressures that both international and local athletes might be facing in addition to practices, including adjusting to a new environment, forming friendships and keeping up with schoolwork. He remembers the sort of rigor the athletes have to manage every day from his time as a student. 
Sophomore goalie Nic Porter, who came to USC from Australia in 2018, said he is appreciative of being able to turn to his coaches for foundational support. 
“USC is, in my opinion, the best possible place for me to be right now,” Porter said. “In terms of the facilities that we have, the coaches we have, the players that this program brings in are some of the best young players in the world. And so for me to be able to train with them and learn from our coaches each and every day for four years is only going to make me into the best possible goalie that I can be.”
The USC women’s team also hosts some of the best young players in the world. While the team lost Megens, Aznar and Kearns for the season as they trained with their respective countries for the Olympics, the remaining players stepped up. Nonetheless, the team felt the absence of three of its top contributors. 
“Most importantly, I think these girls on our team now are wanting them to come back,” Moon said. “It’s much bigger than water polo here. We truly have a family sense and relationship building, and those are their sisters that [are] gone for a whole year. 
“Now obviously, they communicate with them,” he added. “But for them to be back here on campus and be with us every day, I think it’ll just change the dynamic of our team for the better.”
That team dynamic and the ultimate goal of getting a championship ring doesn’t falter when new players come in from outside the U.S. Even players from just outside the coveted Southern California water polo region are trained completely differently from those in USC’s immediate vicinity. Pintaric’s experience helps consolidate these styles to create the Trojans’ near unstoppable level of play. 
“Like I always, always said, we are getting so many different players from so many different places, and in terms of water polo, in terms of language, everybody speaks their own foreign water polo language,” he said.
Moon and Pintaric, who has now spent more than half his life in the U.S., recognize that there is a certain draw to USC that allows it to take hold in the minds of burgeoning players when they make the life-altering decision to move across the world to train while earning a degree.
“I think that the dynamic of college sports here in the States, there’s nowhere like it in the world for us to get challenged in the classroom as well as get challenged in the pool,” Moon said.
