Any indication of the notorious remarks suggesting that no one dances in Los Angeles were left at the door of KXSC’s house show on 24th Street Saturday night. 
USC’s radio station chimed in the new year with their Welcome Back Show that garnered a significant attendance to enjoy DJ XOXO and indie rock bands Frank Pellegrino and Rain on Fridays. 
When doors opened at 8 p.m., the venue welcomed in a line of students and company that wrapped around the corner, suggesting an eagerness for the first live music experience of the semester hosted by the University organization. 
The radio station’s general manager Spencer Churchill, a senior majoring in environmental studies, said he was extremely pleased to see the big turnout.
“I’m really stoked that all these people are into KXSC,” Churchill said. “I’ve been here since before COVID and so it’s wild to see that this many people like KXSC and know about it. It’s cool to see all these people like what we’re doing”
While white indie rock bands might be as common as the bright-eyed freshman, KXSC truly does succeed in finding small talent that deserves a crowd of rowdy college students. 
L.A. rock band Frank Pellegrino, whose first single on Spotify has just over 2,000 listens, opened the night. Though the crowd was seemingly warming up to the night’s festivities — often more chatter than audience engagement — there was still noteworthy attendance and a satisfaction found among those who took to moshing. 
The true highlight of the show followed as San Diego band Rain on Fridays took the stage. With over 24,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, the band has truly made a name for themselves in the indie rock scene since their first single release in 2019. 
They opened their setlist with “Hey Man,” and lead singer Madi Coe immediately captured the attention of everyone in the backyard with their powerful voice. There was a fervor seen throughout the crowd that left everyone embracing the rock-out garage show in the perfect encapsulation of collegiate adolescence. Strained necks and jumping bodies were crashing into one another for what felt like too short of a setlist. 
According to brothers Ryan and Matt Levy, seeing their family friend, guitarist Jesse Miller, grow from a self-taught instrumentalist who once played in friends’ garages to a part of this established band was nothing short of admirable. 
“It’s just a testament to her dedication to the craft and her amazingness in general,” said Ryan Levy, a senior majoring in computer science. “The fact that she taught herself from nothing by herself and now she’s playing in front of hundreds of people. It’s very cool to see, I’m very proud of her.” 
According to KXSC’s live show director Ava Kalenze, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture and cinema and media studies, the live music experience is one she significantly values. Having grown up in Minneapolis surrounded by music, working within L.A. has introduced her to new feats that she welcomes.  
“I think it just feels like it’s happening at a really different level because a lot of people are like ‘I want fame’ and that’s the goal, so I think there’s a level of artist officiality,” Kalenze said. “I’m used to people just slumming it in basements in Minnesota, and it’s just for fun.”
In an effort to honor the DIY sentiment she grew up around, she utilizes her role to book artists by tapping into the local scene and typically having a student performer involved in each show. Kalenze said she tunes in to the “Fans also like” feature on Spotify and pulls from the vast network of bands she’s come to know from hosting the weekly Live Show Fridays at 4 p.m. 
“To me, having authentic experiences with live music is what has made my adolescence and early 20s, so it’s important to be able to do it for other people,” Kalenze said.
A similar sentiment is shared by others on KXSC’s staff team. Though a radio station first and foremost, the live music experience is one that hones in on the community that the organization hopes to establish. 
“For me, live music is one of the most pivotal parts of building community,” said Betsy Schmeler, a sophomore majoring in music industry and KXSC’s street team director. “All of music is about the experience that’s happening with it.” 
For an organization that receives no funding from USC’s undergraduate student government, Churchill said events like these are possible because of the “people who are dedicated because they want to see cool things happen for the sake of cool things happening.”
“It’s kind of incredible to see it go from five to ten people being like ‘a show should happen’ to it happening,” Churchill said. “We’re here just because we like it. We like seeing things happen.”
Though it’s easy to find majorly-funded concerts on campus such as Springfest hosted by the Concerts Committee, Churchill said he believes it is necessary for the station to raise the money themselves and that working with a smaller budget can be an advantage.
“With industry stuff, it’s cool and it’s like okay ‘We have a lot of money so we can do something bigger’ but then we have to make the money back,” Churchill said. “Even with this we kind of have to make our money back and we need people to come but when there’s lower stakes, you can kind of take bigger risks.”
For KXSC, the goal will continue to be putting on the best show possible with what they’ve got, for the people that are in it for the right reasons. 
“Live music is a farce without people who care,” Churchill said.

Right now, if someone asked me what object physically personifies fashion, my answer would be that robot toy that continues to push its own lever back into place. Fashion is constantly pushing back against norms and causing change, in both good and bad ways. 
We see this daily as people work — or rather, rework — regular clothing items to give a new breath of fresh air (the good) or when retail giants like Urban Outfitters attempt to provide affordable, but obviously copied, luxury items to their consumers (the bad).
Even in high fashion, this past Paris Fashion Week had huge press coverage, particularly on Schiaparelli, their animal heads and guest outfits — most notably, red-crystal covered Doja Cat, and Kylie Jenner’s dress that Irina Shayk officially debuted in the same show. Viktor & Rolf also got coverage for their physically off-centered gowns, which were worn flipped on their side, upside down and even next to the model. 
A special shout-out is owed to Maison Margiela. I will always have a soft spot for them. Their latest collection was a fantastic homage from Creative Director John Galliano to the late Vivienne Westwood and her doctrine of the classical, coy and feminine application of punk past anarchy into creative, visual journeys. Leon Dame’s closing walk felt so soft, delicate and — dare I say — maternal, and overall the collection was incredibly cohesive. It felt like listening to that song your favorite artist had been teasing for a long time. 
But with these fashion victories, I’m keeping my eyes on the futures of three brands.
First: Louis Vuitton. Since former creative director Virgil Abloh’s passing in 2021, the brand has not yet named nor demonstrated taking any steps to find its new creative director. But after three successful collections, including their latest menswear collection featuring Rosalía and live music from Kendrick Lamar and conductor Gustavo Dudamel, there may be a future of fashion houses without leading directors. 
Instead of pulling back, Louis Vuitton has increased funding in their marketing, acquired new A-list and international spokespeople and has still managed to keep their consumers engaged. Their starting sprint isn’t looking like it’s going to slow down anytime soon, so it will be interesting to see how LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) will move forward regarding the face (or lack of) for the luxury powerhouse. 
The second is Valentino. Their PFW collection received a standing ovation from Anna Wintour (not only that, she was the first to stand up in the audience), but the show went viral for another reason: the continued feud between models and Valentino shoes.
Don’t get me wrong, these models are doing much better than I ever could. Some shoes are incredibly difficult to strut in, and even the most experienced veterans take a tumble — throwback to Naomi Campbell and the “super elevated Gillie” heels at Westwood’s AW93 show. 
But what is up with Valentino’s shoes? Their newest collection had supermodel Kristen McMenamy give up entirely, taking off her shoes mid-runway to finish her walk after a large tumble. But in October’s Spring/Summer23 runway show, models were not only teetering side to side, but were also confused about where to walk and the layout of the runway. Some speculated a publicity stunt to gain more attention from the media, but I think it’s just poor fitting, poor planning and not enough attention to detail in regard to the models. 
The third brand is the one-and-only Gucci, who has actually had a rough couple of years after being hit harder than other luxury brands.
Interestingly enough, the newly named creative director as of Jan. 28 is Sabato de Sarno, who is a close associate of Valentino’s own creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli. While not new to the world of fashion, as de Sarno worked at Valentino from 2009 after Prada and Dolce & Gabbana, his name is not (yet) a fashion-household name. 
According to Business of Fashion, previous creative director Alessandro Michele tripled the company’s annual sales and quadrupled profits in his years before the pandemic slowed Gucci’s growth. Part of this came from his maximalist aesthetic and incorporation of bright designs, streetwear and logo mania; heavier emphasis on classic styles like the Jackie bag, stripes and the bumblebee; as well as bringing in A-list ambassadors, including Harry Styles and Billie Eilish. 
However, BoF’s prediction is that de Sarno will be “likely to keep the focus on stabilising its brand image with more classical identity.” 
I personally hope this means returning to the classic, minimalist era of Gucci by Tom Ford. 
I don’t have a problem with Michele’s Gucci, but two characteristics have caused me to stray away from his era of Gucci: my love of the black and silver combo and the less-flashy designs, as well as a feeling that Michele’s Gucci was — and bear with me — too Gen-Z. 
The former is a matter of personal taste; my mother dresses this way and gravitates towards quiet, luxury and minimalist design, and I am, after all, my mother’s daughter. 
The latter, though, stems from a desire for brands to stick to their classic roots. I know this is wishful thinking, because all brands must grow and change as people do, but I truly believe that Ford’s era was the best. It was exciting, it felt luxurious in the classic, old-money, quiet luxury-“my dad has a yacht,” way and it was a style that was so obviously Gucci. Playing devil’s advocate, Michele has also created a Gucci that is iconic in its own right. 
However, the vibrant oranges, greens and purples felt almost too rich for the eye to take in and appreciate the actual quality of design — including the careful choices of fabric, stitching, hems and silhouette. It became almost a distraction, and with the striped sneakers and logo mania blowing up, the ready-to-wear collection no longer had the same feeling as their runway. Of course, I don’t mean this in a literal way — collections and ready-to-wear collections are different, and not all runway pieces are sold retail, especially couture and high fashion collections — but since 2018-ish Gucci seemed to be listening to numbers, sales and customers more than the voice of the brand and the history behind their name. 
I’m excited to see de Sarno’s first collections and where he will take Gucci. He has some large shoes to fill, but that doesn’t mean he can’t meet or even exceed expectations. As seen with Ford, sometimes a quiet name is what a brand needs – and, just as excitingly, we all love a good underdog story. 
In bocca al lupo e buona fortuna, de Sarno! Let’s see what you’re made of.

It’s safe to say that Ghetto Rodeo’s showroom grand opening revived Latine culture in East Los Angeles Saturday. The Californian sun seemed to be shining brightly on the El Sereno neighborhood of East L.A. Families and friends relished the perfect weather by gathering at 4671 Huntington Drive to indulge in unique forms of social advocacy. 
Ghetto Rodeo kicked off the celebration with brand owner Brian Saucedo performing a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The entire event spanned from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. with an after-party following the showroom’s closure. The event’s clean structure created a safe and welcoming environment for guests to partake in everything Ghetto Rodeo has to offer, and the community did not have trouble resonating with the event.
Ghetto Rodeo as a brand is able to produce distinctive pieces in a consistent manner like no other streetwear brand in the fashion game. As a philanthropic organization, Ghetto Rodeo promotes and provides a community like no other. The brand’s goal to redefine the beauty standard and re-write stereotypes for the Latine population creates a genuine attempt to make the world better for future generations. However, unlike many other organizations with the same mission, Ghetto Rodeo will succeed. 
“Being a Latina myself, coming here made me feel super welcome because of a lot of the art that’s out here, the music, the food, the people,’’ said Letty Manriquez, an attendee of the event and L.A. native. “It feels like home, I don’t feel unfamiliar.”
The event was separated into three main sections taking up two buildings and a small-sized parking lot. Focusing on community engagement, the parking lot became the hub for guests to gather and speak with each other. At the outside portion of the event, Ghetto Rodeo offered food, drinks and a mechanical bull. The taco vendor on the front side of the lot contributed to a swap meet festival kind of atmosphere.  
The flow of people into the first building led into a white room bursting with the sound of a blend of Latin and hip-hop music coming from the DJ set up in the center point. The rest of the fairly big room was filled with tattoo artists and individual art galleries. At the very left of the room was a collection highlighting the beauty of the average blue-collar male Latino worker. The collection featured pictures of male blue-collar workers in Los Angeles, from construction worker to custodian. 
Another section of the gallery depicted the plight of minority communities in L.A. in past and current times through the development of film taken from disposable cameras. The room ended with a section dedicated to two tattoo artists open for business. 
“The whole brand of Ghetto Rodeo is a tribute to my older brother because without him I wouldn’t know anything about my representation,”  Saucedo said. “He taught me everything I know about my culture.”
The preservation of culture is something that Ghetto Rodeo does extremely well. It’s as if the brand encapsulated what it means to be a Mexican in L.A. who wants more for the community. 
“I was always into fashion and one thing I noticed in fashion and in Hollywood is the lack of representation there is for brown people,” Saucedo said. “I wanted to make a difference.” 
A difference is surely felt. In about a year and a half, Ghetto Rodeo has spurred from an idea to a dominant streetwear brand with its very own showroom. 
“A lot of kids who grew up in worse environments than me, who grew up in the ghetto, being called ghetto, we’re only programmed to know one thing. How to be a gangster or a cholo because it’s how they portray us,” Saucedo said. 
It’s with that in mind that shoppers should look at the array of clothing Ghetto Rodeo offers. The brand resonates with the Mexican community of L.A but does not feed into stereotypes.
Ghetto Rodeo includes a lot of references to L.A. in their backdrops in the majority, if not all of, their marketing campaigns. Saucedo describes Ghetto Rodeo as a representation of “the real faces of our real culture.” Ghetto Rodeo gives representation to the Mexican communities of L.A. while normalizing Latine beauty. 
The main attraction took place in the farthest building from the lot. Upon entering the sizable warehouse-style room, guests were greeted with a telling collection that featured unique forms of expression through hoodies, t-shirts, jeans and more. The core collection of the gallery, located at the center of the room, featured the soon-to-be iconic “I [red heart] Latinas.” Simple yet effective, this t-shirt collection highlights the beauty behind Latina women, which tends to be forgotten when it comes to beauty standards. 
Another classic piece featured in the collection comes in the form of a t-shirt and hoodie. The brown-colored clothing items located on the front right side of the room had no graphics. It simply presents a white-lettered font that reads “NO ONE IS ILLEGAL ON STOLEN LAND” on the front with “FUCK I.C.E” and “GHETTO RODEO” on the back. This t-shirt, although simple in design, is straight to the point and weighs heavy with meaning — like many other current and prior Ghetto Rodeo pieces.
Jannie Maciel, gallery worker and long-time friend of Brian Saucedo, explains that “everything [Saucedo] does is with good intention. I feel like that’s very important and why he’s so successful” Given the recent brand success, it’s safe to say Brian Saucedo seems to be carrying out the brand’s meaning.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all?
A young woman studies her reflection in the glass. Ebony-haired with dark almond eyes, her lips are full, cheekbones subtly peachy. Her eyebrows are straight, skin clear and pale, nose gently sloped. She gives a shy, tight-lipped smile. Swishing wispy layers out of her eyes, the woman studies herself for a moment before flipping the mirror in her hand.
Suddenly, the young lady we became acquainted with is gone. In the glass is another, with sunkissed skin, arched brows and heavier makeup. Strands of blond streak her hair. She flashes a bright smile, crinkling her eyes while revealing rows of pearly whites. Her face looks stronger, more angular … perhaps even more muscular? 
“Mirror, mirror …”
Twice the culture, twice the food, twice the number of holidays! But, as a “______ American,” — Korean American, in my case — this also means twice the beauty standards. Each culture has different values and interpretations of  “beauty.” Separately, this isn’t really an issue, but it’s not often that I find myself able to float seamlessly between the two standards. Much more commonly, it feels like they’re at war with each other.
My Korean side champions pale “glass” skin, a dainty nose and wide eyes with double lids and aegyo sal. Everything should be dainty, light and feminine but natural at the same time. Makeup should be minimal, but also represent a shy, well-mannered and polite personality. Cheeks should have enough fat to be cute, but not too much, of course. 
My American side insists that everything should be viewed through gold-tinted lenses that are too tiny to be practical. Don’t ask why. I’ve been asking for ages, and I still don’t know. Something about Sunkist and Jennifer Coolidge …? Everything here is stronger. The makeup. The features. The personality. The approach. It’s bolder. More colorful. Assertive. 
Let’s put it this way: If my Korean side is Athena, my American side is Minerva. 
My Korean side is soft-spoken but still strong.
My Americ— “WAR WAR WAR WAR WAR WAR WAR WAR WA—”
<CRASH!>
<SLAM!>
Sorry. As you can see, things are pretty chaotic around here. 
Akin to the stylists that give Mulan a makeover, each side pulls my face in different directions to fit its standards.
“Let’s go in the sun, we need to tan!”
“Here, take this umbrella and sunscreen. Stay in the shade.”
In Korea, light skin is associated with being young, innocent and beautiful. A history of deep-rooted, classist culture favors pale skin — it’s seen as a sign of high socioeconomic status. Traditionally, those in society who had lower levels of income typically undertook high labor, outdoor work, which tanned their skin. Even today, beauty products are catered toward lighter skin tones; it’s rare to find Korean cosmetics designed for darker complexions. Skin whiteners are easily found on the market. 
American beauty trends typically favor looking older and more mature. A cosmetic surgery, called “buccal fat removal,” has recently been circulating on social media platforms and among American celebrities. Buccal fat pads are pockets of fat in the corners where your cheeks meet your mouth. This surgery removes pads to thin and hollow out the cheeks, creating a more pronounced, striking and gaunt impression. 
American beauty standards align strongly with sensuality and individuality. To be distinguishable as an individual is to be iconic. However, in Korea, trends serve a different purpose: to be followed, not led. 
Perhaps it’s in culture that we can find context for these warring expectations. 
America is a melting pot of diversity, cultures, ideas and individuals. It’s not an ethno-state, nor could it be due to its expanse. In America, freedom, liberty and individualism are celebrated — to the point that it’s entwined in core legal documents, like the Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
South Korea is a homogenous society. Ethnic Koreans hold an absolute majority. Korean culture is traditionally conservative, and while there has been some change and activism with modern times, it still holds many of its traditional values today. 
Growing up with both standards was challenging. Even today, I’m not exactly sure where I fit in with all of this. Do I style my closet with Korean fashion or American trends? Arched or straight brows? Should I be the suntanned Korean or the sun-deprived American?
Yet, amid this confusion, I’ve incorporated the beauty of both cultures into my life. Korea’s graceful nature, subtlety and calm-kindness are all traits I admire. Likewise, I respect the assertiveness, confidence and vibrancy present in American culture.
Like strands of hair in a braid, I am weaving my experiences, background and culture together to form my identity. This is all that I have. Regardless of whether my experiences as a Korean American are positive or negative, they are incorporated nevertheless. I learn from both.
Unless I have no hair and I’m Professor Quirrell with Voldemort. Can you imagine that?

As a die-hard New York Knicks and New York Jets fan, I have grown accustomed to seeing my favorite teams lose a lot. They lose during the season, they lose during free agency, they lose during the draft, they lose in ways I didn’t even know were possible. I’ve watched as a variety of players only some sports fans would have possibly heard of (Bryce Petty, Lance Thomas, Allonzo Trier and Quincy Enunwa, to name a few) were signed or drafted in hopes of changing the course of these teams for the better — but flopped.
The Knicks and the Jets are by no means the only sports franchises in the last 25 years that have been known as perpetual losing teams. Even though these teams did not have the rosters to compete for the playoffs, let alone a championship, they would still try to spend money on what free agents they could and try to win with the roster they had. That old roster construction philosophy has recently gone out the window; now teams will either go all-in to compete for a championship or dump their entire team in hopes of getting the number one pick in the draft. Welcome to the age of tanking, folks. Whether you like it or not, this is our reality as sports fans.
The idea of tanking, purposely losing games by trading away or resting key players to get a better young player in the draft down the road, has existed for a while. The Houston Rockets did it in 1984 by benching all their starters when they realized they weren’t going to make the playoffs and ended up getting the number one pick in the draft. The strategy seemed to work, because they drafted future Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon with that number one pick. The following year, the NBA instituted the draft lottery so that the draft order of the teams that missed the playoffs would be decided randomly, a hard-hitting blow for all tank-loving general managers.
Most modern-day sports fans know more about tanking from the Philadelphia 76ers and their “trust the process” mindset. When new general manager Sam Hinkie took over, he inherited a team who had just missed the playoffs by two games but finished with a 34-48 record. Hinkie decided it was best to trade away all his players that had value in return for as many draft picks he could get, and then fill his roster with as many players as he could sign for the cheapest amount possible. The 76ers and Hinkie would never say that they were purposefully losing games, but it was clear they sure weren’t trying to win. They didn’t win more than 19 games for three straight years and were one loss off from tying the NBA record for most losses in a season in 2016. But hey, it did work to some extent given they got a ton of high draft picks and are now a top-three team in the Eastern Conference.
Ever since the 76ers employed it, this tanking philosophy has spread to every major sports league, with at least a couple of teams succumbing to the tanking mindset every year. You probably don’t care as much when you see other teams do it, but it could not be more gut-wrenching when your team does it. Knowing your team is doing all they can to trade away your favorite players in an effort to win in three years down the line, if everything even goes according to plan, is the worst.
How can sports leagues enforce stricter rules to ensure teams don’t tank? Most of the time, it’s pure opinion on whether you think a team is tanking or not. There are no set guidelines to enter into “tanking territory,” it’s utterly subjective. Possible rules you could implement could also hurt teams trying to win.
If leagues made a rule that you can’t rest your starters to make sure a tanking team plays all the players they have, that would also hurt teams trying to win and have their players on load management. If leagues set a limit on the number of trades a team can make or the amount of total draft picks a team can have, I’m looking at you Oklahoma City, that could also hurt teams that are trying to add more pieces to their team and win a championship now.
While the NBA is doing it better than most leagues with having the lottery so a team isn’t guaranteed the number one pick, it won’t stop teams from trying to tank. The Oklahoma City Thunder are in such a deep tank that they have asked for and received a draft pick for the 2029 draft in a trade. That draft pick will turn out to be a kid who is currently 12 years old and in sixth grade. These teams will do anything to get their monopoly on young talent when they can.
While tanking may be around for the long haul, it doesn’t always work out for these teams, and sometimes they don’t get what they want after trying to lose as much as they can. Look at my two beloved sports franchises, who somehow couldn’t even tank properly. The New York Jets tried to tank for the 2021 draft to get Trevor Lawerence, but won one too many games and missed out on the first overall pick.
And three years prior, the Knicks tried to tank for Zion Williamson and even finished with the worst record in the NBA, but to my dismay, the lottery fooled their plans. The number one pick went to the New Orleans Pelicans, who had 16 more wins than the Knicks.
It’s now commonplace for a general manager to be under fire for not blowing up his roster and starting over. Fans are adapting and calling for their teams to start from scratch as soon as expectations aren’t met for a given season. We live in a world where instant gratification is above all, and that has seeped its way into sports. There isn’t much we can do to fix the tanking epidemic; it’s the new norm for sports fans. All you can do is hope and pray that your team won’t be the next to dismantle their entire roster before your eyes. For better or for worse, tanking is here to stay.

Being in Los Angeles, USC has earned the reputation of being a hub for fashion. My friends and I once joked about the pressure to look good every day, and while “good” at my state university back home might mean the “fit/athletic” look — dressed in all lululemon at best — the bar is much higher at USC. One of my friends even told me that during her internship over the summer, she always showed up to work make-up free, but now she spends half an hour or more every morning on makeup and hair because she feels the pressure to look good on campus.
On the other hand, maybe you wake up, go to your closet in the morning and randomly pick out a sweater and put on a pair of jeans, all with your eyes still half-open. You may think that none of what goes on in the lofty high-fashion world has anything to do with you. Perhaps you’re trying to tell the world that you don’t care about what you put on your back, or perhaps you’re not trying to make any statement about yourself at all — simply trying to be. No unnecessary attention. No struggling to find an outfit to impress the public eye. 
Unless you live life on the edge and present yourself as so comfortable in your own skin that you risk being arrested for public indecency, you do put on something in the morning, and, in doing so, you make a choice. That choice says something about you, whether you like it or not.
Indeed, you are what you wear in today’s society and what you throw on in the morning is a medium of forming identities from commodities. The fashion of politics has long been studied in the departments of gender studies, cultural history and other academic disciplines. There are inseparable links between culture, politics and aesthetics, all threaded together by clothing that can be directly observed in the real political world: Bernie Sanders’ suits are intentionally always too big, conveying his image of being too busy studying policy to change his clothes — the opposite of slick — while the GOP candidates and their zip-front-pullovers that seem straight out of a L.L.Bean catalog clearly make them more approachable and endearing than a suit would. 
While miniskirts nowadays may symbolize the comeback of the Y2K aesthetic, they were first invented in the 1960s as a great fashion revolution, a symbol of women’s liberation in a time when whether a woman could expose her thighs was a dividing question in American society. 
Feminist movements over the past few decades have made us realize the power of fashion as well as the implicit messages behind clothing. We are more conscious of who we are dressing for and why. While the hoodie and sweatpants look may not seem like anything more than a casual but comfortable outfit without much thought put into it, the very fact that women have the power to choose to wear gender-neutral clothes instead of being constricted to traditionally feminine clothing reveals fashion as the nexus of the political and the personal. 
Even one’s indifference toward fashion speaks to something about one’s identity. Just as a person of color tends to be more aware of white privilege or a person of nonbinary identity is more likely to notice the gender binary in everyday life, those who don’t experience internal struggles with their identity — because they conform to socially constructed narratives of who they should be — are likely less concerned with carving their identities through external things like clothes. 
In that sense, there is nothing simple about feeling comfortable in a simple white-tee: The absence of the need or desire to make statements through what you wear is, in itself, a privilege. Not everyone gets to feel comfortable in the style that is deemed the most appropriate and normal for them by society. For example, if the question of “who am I dressing for?” has never come across your mind, then you probably have not experienced what it feels like to have to dress for someone else by objectifying your body. 
Class, politics and privilege are woven into clothes. What we wear has long been a tool and symbol for religious, social and political movements, and in an age where fashion is still intimately linked to our gender, cultural and religious identity and where the fashion industry’s impact on the environment is more noticeable than ever, we should make conscious dressing more relevant.

Despite a slow start for the USC women’s basketball team, their high-percentage 3-point shooting allowed them to beat the then-No. 25 Colorado Buffaloes 71-54 Sunday afternoon. Following an 83-73 loss to the then-No. 9 Utah Utes Friday night, the Trojans closed out a two-game road trip against top-25 opponents with a dominant victory. 
Although the Trojans came into the game as 6.5-point underdogs, the Trojans’ high-percentage shooting — especially in the third and fourth quarters — allowed them to keep their lead out of reach. USC began the game without much success on the offensive end but were able to find the hot hand in the second half, in which they scored 45 of their 71 points.
On the first possession of the second half, senior guard Destiny Littleton, who has been a huge part of the team’s success this season, drilled a 3-pointer that would be the start of a 15-5 run for the Trojans. Along with contributions from graduate student guard Okako Adika, sophomore forward Rayah Marshall, senior guard Alyson Miura and graduate student forward Kadi Sissoko, the Trojans’ run allowed them to maintain a comfortable lead throughout the rest of the game. Littleton, Sissoko and Marshall led the way offensively with 21, 18 and 19 points respectively. Miura came off of the bench and hit two crucial 3-pointers that crushed any hope of Colorado making a late-game comeback. 
Littleton, a transfer from South Carolina, has recently been impactful on the court for the Trojans. She’s averaging nearly 16 points per game over her last 6 outings, including the team’s upset over No. 2 Stanford on January 15. 
As a team, the Trojans shot the ball extremely well, going 44.8% from the field and 47.4% from beyond the arc. On top of shooting 10 of 12 from the stripe, the Trojans’ recent theme of high-scoring games continues, even during tough road trips against high-quality teams.
After giving up a season high 83 points to Utah, the Trojans hoped to improve their performance on the defensive side of the ball and did so in their contest against the Buffs, holding them to just 54 points. While a strong offensive performance certainly overshadows any other statistic, Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb praised the team’s defensive effort. 
“Our connectedness on the defensive end and really just knowing that’s our calling card,” said Gottlieb in a postgame interview. “Like going back to our identity and making it a priority to get stops.”
After several long road stints, the Trojans will return to Los Angeles for four straight home games as the second half of Pac-12 play begins. Upon reflecting on several close games throughout their away trips, Gottlieb said the team has learned much from difficult road performances, and expressed that she feels hopeful for the rest of the season. 
“[This trip] proves that we’re capable of doing really hard things,” Gottlieb said. “This is a tough trip, both physically because of altitude and travel and also because these two teams are really good, so just knowing that we’re capable of beating anyone when we play the type of basketball that’s worthy of getting a win in this conference.”
The Trojans, now 6-4 in the Pac-12, good enough for sixth place in the conference, look to continue their climb up the standings as they return home for a much-needed travel break.
“I think we take a lot of confidence away from [this trip] and we’re not done setting our standards high,” Gottlieb said. “We know we have a bunch of home games in a row but that’s no license for us to relax at all so I think that this is a group with a lot of confidence and a lot of belief.”
The Trojans look to continue their winning ways against Arizona State next Friday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.

October 2022 saw a decade-high peak in crimes committed in the University Park neighborhood, an area of Los Angeles that includes USC’s University Park Campus. 
Data from the Los Angeles Police Department reported 236 crimes in the month of October, a number higher than any recorded month since January 2010. This amounts to an average of seven crime reports a day. The second highest count was recorded the following month —  221 in November. 
In addition to the October high, 2022 as a whole saw an increase in reported crimes, with 1,914 crimes reported in University Park alone for the entire year. Crosstown LA’s University Park newsletter documented a 36% increase in crime reports from 2021 to 2022 by the LAPD, though they acknowledged that some of the most violent offenses, such as aggravated assault and murder, began to slow at the end of the year.
Gabriel Kahn, professor of professional practice of journalism and the founder of Crosstown —  a non-profit, data-focused news organization — wrote in a Crosstown L.A. newsletter that “crime means many things … from aggravated assault to misdemeanor vandalism. There is also a lot that the LAPD data doesn’t capture, such as wage theft and most white-collar crimes.” 
Some types of crime have spiked while others have fallen slightly. For example, homicides fell in 2022, but they remain above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, armed robberies jumped by more than 30%.
The neighborhoods surrounding University Park also saw an increase in crime over the past year, but not by quite as much. The number of reported crimes in Adams/Normandie went up by 12%, those in Exposition Park were up by 15% and those in Historic South Central up by 26%.
In interviews with the Daily Trojan, some students said safety issues in USC’s surrounding area are not a big concern for them — despite the rising number of crimes reported in the University Park neighborhood. 
“If it’s within one block, two blocks [of USC], I feel like it’s fine because we have a lot of patrol people go around the campus,” said Kevin Ou, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science. 
“[USC is] worried about people engaging in unsafe behavior and having to walk back home, [but they are] forcing people to either separate or wait for a long period of time. I don’t see how that’s helpful.” 
University safety ambassadors are contracted by USC to patrol street corners within a two and a half mile range of campus. This program has been in place since 2009, an addition to the Department of Public Safety’s patrols to ensure students’ safety in the surrounding area. 
Another program to ensure public safety is the blue light emergency phone system, which has locations across campus and surrounding areas that students can use to call for an escort, report crimes or report suspicious activities directly to DPS. If the caller is unable to talk, DPS can identify the location of the phone.  
Although USC offers several programs to ensure public safety, a few students said the change in the USC-Lyft partnership program — students must now select the shared ride option to be financially covered by USC — is not considerate of students’ safety. 
“[USC is] worried about people engaging in unsafe behavior and having to walk back home, [but they are] forcing people to either separate or wait for a long period of time,” said Memphis Johnston, a freshman majoring in public relations. “I don’t see how that’s helpful.” 
Dweepa Honnavalli, a second-year graduate student studying computer science, expressed misgivings about the safety of the University Park neighborhood and said it was challenging to adjust to as an international student.
“I actually recently had to call the cops because an unknown man and I were arguing and he refused to leave,” Honnavalli said. “Everyone is safe, but it’s still kind of scary, especially if you’re not from the country … to come and see a crime in like a week; It’s kind of hard.”
Honnavalli echoed the worries that other students have about the Lyft program and said the change makes her feel even more unsafe. 
“It’s hard to even get a Lyft and it takes longer for you to get home at night,” Honnavalli said. “All of that adds to how unsafe people feel around. [USC] should first bring back the individual rides, and then they should expand the Lyft zone to maybe two or three more miles.” 
DPS did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment in time for publication.
