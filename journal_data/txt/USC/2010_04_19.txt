The USC Viterbi School of Engineering’s graduate program fell from seventh to 10th on this year’s U.S. News & World Report Best Engineering Schools list after the administrating body corrected a reporting error that was largely responsible for the school’s high rank last year.
Pitfalls · USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering dropped three places in the U.S. News Rankings after correcting last year’s reporting error. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Viterbi ranked seventh last year, but in June Inside Higher Ed reported that Viterbi had inaccurately listed the number of faculty members who are part of the National Academy of Engineering, a high distinction in the field. U.S. News uses the percentage of NAE members on a school’s faculty as a criterion for ranking.
Because of what administrators said was an honest mistake, Viterbi reported the total number of NAE faculty members, not just full-time, tenure-track professors as the U.S. News survey stipulates.
This year, better attention was paid to the numbers reported, and Viterbi fell three places in the rankings.
“In the rankings that were published a year ago, the USC Viterbi School said they had 18.3 percent of faculty with NAE membership for the 2008 year,” said Robert Morse, Director of Data Research for U.S. News & World Report. “For the 2009 year, they said it was 8.9 percent. That was more or less the main reason why the school fell from seventh to tenth place.”
According to Leslie DaCruz, executive director of communications and marketing for Viterbi, the school, in response to U.S. News’s request, reported the number of tenured faculty with NAE membership for the 2010 rankings.
“Basically, we went to a stricter way of reporting and we knew it was going to affect our ranking in some way,” DaCruz said. “Being ranked 10 this year keeps us in great company.”
In addition to the change in the number of NAE faculty reported, the drop in rankings was also influenced by a combination of other factors, including the performance of other schools in the 10 metrics used for the calculations. Because schools submit new information for the rankings every year, there is always movement up and down.
For students considering graduate programs in engineering, rankings can factor into the decision.
Xiaoran Wang, a graduate student from China studying electrical engineering, said she looked at rankings over a period of years for the graduate programs she considered applying to and also considered admission rates, cost and location. The most important factor she considered, however, was the academic reputation of the school and the program she wanted to study.
“I think ranking was a very important factor when I chose a graduate school, [but] I think reputation was the most important because people in China prefer to go to high reputation schools; and reputation will help you find a job and get into doctorate programs,” Wang said.
Wang also added that USC’s drop on the list is not significant to her.
“I don’t think a change of three or four places is a huge drop. Ranks rise and fall, and [the drop] is not that important,” she said.
DaCruz said that the school is not concerned by the drop because of the natural fluctuation in rankings it has experienced over the years.
“Over the last 10 years, Viterbi has been from No. 12 to No. seven,” DaCruz said.“The rankings are one of many different measures and they really change. The important thing is the quality of education people get, and that’s the reason why they choose to come here.”
U.S. News & World Report surveyed 198 graduate programs in the country to get information used for the rankings. It calculated the rankings based on 10 criteria, including research expenditures, number of Ph.D. graduates, enrollment and graduate record examination scores.

Before the Trojans take the field for the first home game of the 2010 season, one student will be tasked with leading the Trojan Marching Band onto the field and kicking off the day’s events with the ceremonial stabbing of the field.
Marching in · Drum Major Kenny Morris leads the Trojan Marching Band onto the field at a football game at the Coliseum this fall. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
Five band members will compete for the coveted drum major spot tonight: Kyle Wilson, a junior majoring in theatre who plays trombone; Keith Yoerg, a sophomore majoring in astronautics and space technology who plays trumpet; Josh Zieve, a junior majoring in fine arts who plays trumpet; Iwari Dewees, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering who plays the tenor saxophone; and Timothy Larson, a junior majoring in neuroscience who plays trumpet.
On Tuesday night, the candidates will take turns giving vocal commands, marching and giving motivational speeches. The entire marching band will then vote on who will carry the sword come fall.
Kenny Morris, this year’s drum major, said the drum major must provide leadership to each section in the band.
“How effective, cohesive and powerful the band is comes down to the leader. These guys will have to step into that role. It’s something that I had to do,” Morris said. “To be that fire, to be that person that says ‘We are great, but we can be even greater.’”
Morris won the drum major position last year over Larson, though the selection was tough.
The original audition resulted in a tie between Larson and Morris that was decided by a spring scrimmage. Larson and Morris split the time as drum major during the scrimmage, and a re-vote declared Morris the winner.
Larson said losing out on the position last year has prepared him to audition again this year.
“I think I am more driven this year. I don’t regret not getting it last year, but I’m not entirely sure if I was ready for it,” Larson said. “It has pushed me to try even harder this year.”
For Wilson, the decision to try out was simple because he has been immersed in the USC band since an early age.
“My brother and sister are both graduates of USC, and they were both in the band, so I’ve known of the position since I was about six years old,” Wilson said. “That’s when I absolutely fell in love with the band.”
As a member of ROTC, Wilson feels he is prepared to lead the Trojan Marching Band.
“I was taught to be a leader, not a follower. Having been around the band for so long, I will be able to continue to uphold the traditions and take charge,” Wilson said.
Yoerg is the youngest drum major hopeful.
“Initially, people might think [my age] will be a factor, but when it comes down to my audition, it won’t weigh as heavily on their minds,” Yoerg said.
Yoerg is excited by this chance to usher USC football into a new era.
“I think that I can definitely bring the enthusiasm, and part of the reason is that I love USC football,” Yoerg said. “Now we just have to prove that we’re still the Trojans and that it’s not just Pete Carroll who held the team together.”
Zieve has prior experience as a drum major for his high school.
“I’ve had many leadership positions in the past, so I feel like I’m ready to be drum major. It’s really something that I’ve aspired to since I’ve been a freshman at USC,” Zieve said.
Zieve said it is important for the drum major to connect with all types of people in the band.
“The drum major should be someone who everyone can get along with and relate to,” Zieve said. “No one wants a drum major who thinks they’re better or doesn’t work as hard.”
Dewees said he has worked since his freshman year to reach the level of skill required to lead the band. 
“I just didn’t give up, and I put in four years of hard work to get to the point where I am in a good position to lead the Trojan Marching Band,” Dewees said. “Not giving up on your dreams can help you realize them no matter how far you are from the picture at the beginning.”
Members of the band said that the most important characteristic for a potential drum major is having leadership skills.
“The drum major is the leader of the band, both on and off the field,” said K.C. Busby, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “[He’s] in charge of keeping up the intensity at practice, making sure we’re all doing what we’re supposed to and keeping our enthusiasm at a really high level.”
The auditions will be held Tuesday and, except in the case of a tie, the winner should be announced immediately after the vote.
Bruce, I am cool with that. As an OIF  VET I am proud that an ROTC person is trying out. But in the future, I would like a Veteran Student from OIF or OEF to try out. Male, female, I don’t care.
Jim,
I understand what you mean. Maybe one day hopefully in the near future, we can have a male and a female drum major to lead the band. Tommy and Tammy Trojan =D
Bruce, no offense to women, but this is a warrior-type of gig.  I am sure a woman will hold the position some day but I think most women would agree TOMMY Trojan should be a guy.
Why can’t a woman lead the band?

Professors’ salaries nationwide increased less this year than ever in recent history, and this was especially true at USC, though the move was intentional.
An annual study from the American Association of University Professors revealed a miniscule 1.2 percent increase in academic salaries across the United States in 2009-2010. USC raised its salaries less than half that amount.
“We instituted a pay freeze,” said Martin Levine, vice provost of faculty affairs. “The economic recession hit everyone hard, but we are increasing salaries over the two-year period to counteract it.”
The pay freeze meant that administrative staff earning salaries above $57,000 did not receive an increase in salary during the 2009-2010 school year.
“Our endowment dropped almost a third in value, so we would either have had to let valuable staff and faculty go or have raised tuition substantially,” said Alex Capron, president of the Academic Senate. “We didn’t want to resort to either.”
Capron said the Academic Senate agreed to the pay freeze after reviewing the university’s circumstances.
“It was the best solution in a bad situation,” he said.
Thanks to the pay freeze, USC was able to keep its faculty members and raise tuition by just 3.95 percent, the smallest percentage since 1969.
“Our main source of revenue is tuition, so we’re grateful that families and students continue to love us and to apply,” Levine said. “Our budget did very well compared to that of our peer institutions.”
USC plans to resume its salary increases next year.
“We set our salaries individually on the basis of merit, and we’re now determining the faculty salaries for next year,” Levine said. “The average increase will be appreciably greater than inflation over the last two years. We want to pay our faculty what they’re worth.”
The 1.2 percent national salary increase reported by the AAUP is the smallest jump in at least 50 years, falling even below the rate of inflation for the year, which was 2.7 percent.
According to Levine, USC’s faculty pay increases for the 2010-2011 school year will exceed the inflation rate for the same two-year period.
“Some universities always give increases on a two-year cycle,” he said. “We usually do it every year, but this time we’re doing it on a two-year basis.”
The AAUP report also did not include the effects of midyear salary cuts and furloughs at public universities.
“We use the data provided by universities at the beginning of their school year, and they weren’t anticipating furloughs and state budget cuts,” said John Curtis, AAUP director of research and public policy.
Curtis is currently working to find how much the furloughs at institutions like the University of California schools affected the AAUP’s average. The UC system reports that furloughs could account for anywhere from 4 to 10 percent of unreported salary decrease.
“Many of our peer universities across the country had furloughs not reflected in the [AAUP report’s] numbers,” Levine said. “We’re quite proud that we did not have furloughs or pay cuts.”
Curtis said the AAUP was expecting the drop in salary increases given the nation’s economic condition.
“We knew this year would be tough — our last report was titled ‘On the Brink,’” he said. “Higher education tends to take longer to recover from recessions than the economy as a whole does.”

Students and community members from both sides of the aisle gathered at Exposition Park on Monday to welcome President Barack Obama, who visited Los Angeles to speak at a fundraiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer’s re-election campaign.
Speaking out · A man protests on Figueroa Street during President Barack Obama’s visit to Exposition Park on Monday. He and 35 others argued against the military presence in the Middle East. About 20 others attended to protest re-electing Sen. Barbara Boxer. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
Obama arrived in Exposition Park at around 5 p.m. by helicopter. Both protestors and supporters were in attendance to greet him.
Though Exposition Park was gated off and entrance to the night’s events was too expensive for many students — tickets for the reception at the California Science Center ranged from $250 to $2,500 and tickets to the dinner at the Natural History Museum cost $17,600 — some chose to stand along Figueroa Street to protest or show support.
Several members of USC College Democrats turned out to the event in support of Boxer’s campaign.
“The Democrats are out here because we support President Obama and we support Barbara Boxer,” said Aaron Perman, a junior majoring in business administration and the vice president of USC College Democrats. “We believe Barbara Boxer is the right choice for California.”
Perman said the group had hoped to get more members out to Exposition Park to be a stronger presence.
“Unfortunately, we’re spread out. We all had classes now, and we have a meeting later tonight,” Perman said.
About 50 protestors, including USC students, were also on hand for the president’s arrival. Members of USC Students for Carly, a support group for Republican senatorial candidate Carly Fiorina, attended the event to show their support for Fiorina and voice their opposition to Boxer and Obama.
“It was a  really positive experience for everyone who was there,” said Lauren Korbatov, co-chair for Students for Carly. “One group of people was anti-Obama because they opposed the war, and our protestors were there to support Carly Fiorina … We were there to represent Carly’s campaign and voters who want to see Barbara Boxer defeated.”
Some students happened upon the fundraiser unintentionally and found themselves unable to get through. Because of security concerns, officials closed several heavily trafficked streets, including Figueroa between Exposition Boulevard and Martin Luther King Boulevard, Exposition between Figueroa and Vermont Avenue, Flower Street between Exposition and 38th Street, and Figueroa between McCarthy Way and Exposition. USC gates 1 and 2 were also closed from 5 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.
Though students understood the need for enhanced security, some found the traffic barriers inconvenient.
“It’s already pretty hard to get around campus because the streets are always under construction, so I think it’s really unnecessary,” said Jonalyn Abraham, a sophomore majoring in architecture who was turned away at a gate near Exposition as she was biking with a friend. “Our campus doesn’t need to be closed off if it’s over there.”
Thank you , DailyTrojan. By mentioning that there was an actual, real protest or two on Fig; you bravely demolish the media blackout. Kttv L.A.-11 showed it. You Trojans have now shown it; and that’s it. Everyone else ( on the alphabet tv stations), faked it.  That’s right, they faked it. 2,4 and 7 very carefully cropped their shots so as to only show one small faction  of about 15 single-issue sign waivers. I stood there and watched them do it, knowing they were making the war protest  disappear. That’s me in the red shirt , out of focus in the background; that’s right , I’m one of those insane crackpots who objects to the lack of prosecution after the mass-murder of one million Iraqis. And yes, I attended every protest I could during Cheney\Bush. Oh, and yes I voted for Obama;who warned us he would escalate Afghanistan. Life contains regrets.
 Thanks again for mentioning the war protest.
This says next to nothing about people protesting the president and his policies, but leads with a photograph referencing the protest?  I know the number of people in “liberal” California opposing the POTUS–because of moral/ethical matters of politics and not Republican party ones–is small, but this makes the presence and effort of these students and community members mean even more. Real protest is hard. These people deserved more than a sentence in this article, especially given the lead-line and traffic-driving photograph are about them.

Coachella is always a desert transformed — an oasis for the noisy, the avant garde and those who get down and dirty. This year, business executives and punk rockers commiserated in the name of rock ‘n’ roll, electronica and hip-hop — anything to make their head spin, hands clap or hips shake.
For first-timers, the most immediate sensation is the smell — a pungent combination of aerosol sunscreen, cigarettes, horse excrement, french fries and marijuana smoke that wafts to the sky, as if an incense offering to the music gods above.
A crowdsurfer enjoys the Bassnectar set. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
This is hipster Christmas: high-waisted shorts, fanny packs and suspenders abound. There were endless bad tattoos, fedora hats, exposed bellies (flat and round alike), multicolored dreadlocks, surface piercings, kilt-wielding men, war paint, whimsical feathers and bare feet.
The elaborate campgrounds contained shelters fashioned of car doors, tarps, sticks, PVC pipes, places for community sculptures — even a roller rink and a swing set.
It was strange to see something so subversive and so corporate at the same time. Littered in between giant sculptures made of trash, a huge origami crane and a tube that shoots up intermittent flames were mini marketing havens. H&M, Red Bull and even State Farm Insurance enticed attendees to buy stuff from their white tents.
There were foreign tourists whose English only functioned when rapping along to De La Soul and 12-year-old girls sitting on their fathers shoulders reaching out to B.o.B. Elderly men in mohawks rocked out to The Specials, and groups of frat tanks spun glowsticks to the tune of Tiësto.
Everyone comes back from the weekend with feet covered in a film of mud, dry grass and various food sauces that were spilled on the ground.
Coachella is three days of heightened unreality, hula hoops and ferris wheels spinning to the high-pitched screech of a turntable scratch. It leaves your heart ringing, your wallet empty, your heels aching, your nose burnt and your mouth dry. You mught have lost your phone, broken your camera and forgotten in which dusty, hot lot you left your car, but even during that slow, long trudge back to civilization, one thing can be said — Coachella is a trip.

Saturday, April 17, 6:59 a.m.: A line of bleary-eyed yet eager shoppers snaked along the sidewalk adjacent to Fingerprints, an independently run music shop in the Belmont Shore section of Long Beach.
The throng, a shoddy assortment of teenagers and adults donning jeans and sneakers, plaid button-downs and band T-shirts, was a somewhat unusual fixture on Belmont Shore’s Melrose Boulevard-reminiscent Second Street, the well-groomed community’s main drag that consists mostly of chain coffee shops and retail boutiques.
On an ordinary Saturday during normal store hours (10 a.m. through 11 p.m.), Fingerprints hardly blends in, despite its unassuming stucco exterior that bears only several windows usually clouded with colorful posters and do-it-yourself fliers announcing album releases and local shows.
The inside is even more of an anomaly on the pristine block with its deep wooden cases of vinyl and CDs packed like a can of sardines and partitioned by white plastic cards adorned with Sharpie marker scrawl.
Yet, most peculiar about the corner of Second Street and Roycroft Avenue Saturday morning was that every customer waiting for Fingerprints to open its doors at 7 a.m. did not exactly know why he was out and about at that unholy hour. According to Fingerprint’s website, the store ordered more than 150 “exclusive releases,” but wouldn’t know which would be in stock “until the boxes hit the floor.”
“If there is something you’re determined to add to your collection, you’re gonna want to get here early,” proclaimed the webpage.
And so they did.
Meanwhile, in Claremont, Calif., music enthusiasts young and old gathered outside Rhino Records at 10 a.m. to receive wristbands for an in-store performance by New Jersey-based trio Yo La Tengo. For the experimental noise pop band, Rhino was not just a pit stop on the way to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival but also Yo La Tengo’s first acoustic set in California since 1993.
In the hills of Los Angeles’ East Side neighborhoods, Echo Park’s hole-in-the-wall record shop, Origami Vinyl, held an afternoon concert that featured L.A. locals Dum Dum Girls, U.K. natives Male Bonding and Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh founding member Lou Barlow. Further west on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, Amoeba Music hosted a wristband-only Smashing Pumpkins performance at nearby Space 15 Twenty, while Amoeba browsers were treated to a book signing with hard-rock musician Slash and various D.J. sets.
And that was just Los Angeles.
Up north in San Francisco, French actress/singer-songwriter Charlotte Gainsbourg made a detour on her way to the Coachella Valley, stopping for a few hours at that city’s Amoeba Music for an in-store concert. On the East Coast, the already-buzzing streets of New York City were even more abuzz with music lovers swarming stores from Greenwich Village to Brooklyn.
Across the pond, audiophiles in the United Kingdom were treated to a series of exclusive vinyl pressings, including a newly released limited edition single, “Plundered My Soul,” rediscovered from the homegrown Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street (1972) recording session.
It might have been Coachella weekend for some 75,000 concertgoers, but for the rest of us it was Record Store Day.
The brainchild of Bull Moose employee Chris Brown and established in 2007 by Criminal Records manager Eric Levin and a coalition of independent music retailers, including Michael Kurtz, Carrie Colliton, Amy Dorfman, Don Van Cleave and Brian Poehner, Record Store Day has become a Christmas morning of sorts for record collectors, vinyl nerds and advocates of Mom and Pop stores.
Struggling to stay afloat in this age of multimedia chains and iTunes downloads, Record Store Day was conceived in order to connect independently owned music shops, artists and consumers to show that music is meant to be bought and appreciated with care.
Now in its third year as a globally recognized event, Record Store Day continues to grow exponentially. More than 1,400 stores spanning the United States and United Kingdom participated in this year’s event, compared to 300 stores in 2008. Additionally, 2010’s record of 150 exclusive releases is a significant jump from 2008’s 10 special releases.
“It was crazy this morning,” said a staff member at Fingerprints over the drone of psych-rock band Dios, which was throwing an album release concert in the store late Saturday afternoon, as customers continued to file in and out. “There must have been over 100 people lined up outside.”
The inception and increasing attendance of Record Store Day comes at a prime time for vinyl record sales and the music industry as a whole: According to Nielsen SoundScan, an information system that tracks music and music video product sales throughout the United States and Canada, vinyl sales were the highest in 2009 since SoundScan began tracking music sales in the late 1980s. Overall, 2.5 million new albums were sold, presenting a 33 percent increase from 2008 sales.
Though the resurgence of vinyl and, on a lesser scale, cassettes still remains a mystery, it seems that no one minds if it remains unsolved. For indie-minded musicians, the reasoning is simple: Vinyl and cassette releases are an easy way to get your music out to the world on a limited budget.
But in our contemporary lifestyle, vinyl by design is inaccessible. It’s clunky, oversized and incapable of being uploaded to our iPods or played in our car stereos. With its cohesiveness as a medium, however, vinyl is a vehicle for appreciating an album as one unified work of art.
Akin to creating mixtapes, which required more labor than simply dragging MP3 files from one folder into another, uncovering the much-lusted-for record is like discovering a gem among a pile of rubble — you have to earn it.
More than anything, vinyl forces you to cultivate your musical knowledge. Perusing floor-to-ceiling stacks of records compels you to learn the difference among first editions and reissues, stereo and mono versions, and the history behind an artist’s discography. Like Tom Waits, who performed during the 2009 Record Store Day, said in support of independently run record shops: “Folks who work here are professors. Don’t replace all the knowers with guessors — keep ’em open, they’re the ears of the town.”
Although local stores like Amoeba and Origami Vinyl frequently host events, Record Store Day reminds everyone from music snobs to casual listeners that audio stores outside of retail hybrids, such as Best Buy and Borders, exist on a larger scale. And although cynics like to contend the recent increase in sales is a minor blip on the music industry radar, which continues to fight stagnant CD revenue, vinyl’s morphing connotation from antiquated to classic represents a much-needed change in consumers’ need for high-quality rather than faddish or mass-produced items.
If only Record Store Day could do for 35mm film and independent bookstores what it does for vinyl, there would truly be a revolution of the obsolete on our hands.

Fewer than three years after the little-seen British dark comedy Death at a Funeral was lauded for its eccentric ensemble cast, the American version — which opened in theaters Friday — attempts to recapture some of its appeal.
Bereaved · The American version of Death at a Funeral opened Friday. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Studios 
The farce centers on a death that brings together a plethora of zany relatives and extended family members who would have otherwise not associated with one another. Though classified as a remake, the American version clearly distinguishes itself from its British counterpart.
In fact, actors Chris Rock, who plays an unpublished, aspiring writer and son of the deceased, and Tracy Morgan, who plays a semi-obnoxious family friend, did not even watch the original to prepare for their roles.
“We wanted to add our own flavor to it,” Morgan said. “I wanted to complement the role that I saw [in the script].”
Without the influence of its namesake predecessor, the new Death at a Funeral was able to craft American-themed humor around the movies’ similar story structure. Whereas the British version caters toward more subdued British tastes and sentiments, the recent remake is a more brash and outlandish comedy aimed to appeal to all Americans, despite the largely black cast.
“The British are very mannered, very polite about this,” Rock said. “This is an American audience movie. This is not soul play. Me and Tracy are two guys that have worked for mass audiences for more than a decade.”
Despite the distinctly American flavor, the structure of the story is very similar to the original with scenes that closely resemble its British counterpart.
In one of the earlier scenes, Elaine and Oscar, an interracial couple played by Zoe Saldana and James Marsden, express their anxiety at the thought of another encounter with Elaine’s disapproving father. To calm him down, Elaine gives Oscar a pill from a bottle labeled “valium,” which the audience knows has been replaced with a hallucinogenic pill. Just as in the original, what unfolds from that particular plot line is a running joke filled with dramatic irony.
Both versions also cast Peter Dinklage, a dwarf who plays Frank, the deceased’s secret gay lover. Like the character in the British film, Frank attempts to blackmail the bereaved brothers Aaron (Rock) and Ryan (Martin Lawrence) with photographs that proves their father was a homosexual.
The funeral is the film’s “MacGuffin,” a term coined by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock to describe an essentially pointless plot device that motivates the characters’ actions. As family secrets unravel, it is clear that any similarly unifying event could have instigated the movie’s hilarious situations. And several times throughout the film, the various characters seem to acknowledge this as they are reeled back in and reminded to respect the memory of Aaron and Ryan’s father.
These times ease the tension and conflict of the story and become rare moments for the family to bond, not argue.
At its core, Death at a Funeral is a lighthearted look into family misunderstandings, but the film’s title tells more about its moral than its plot devices. In addition to being about the death of the protagonists’ father, the movie is also about the death of intolerance within family relationships. Throughout the film, for example, Aaron and Ryan cannot stand each other. Yet, in the end, they accept each other for who they are.
“The movie is about acceptance,” Rock said. “This guy’s dad was gay, but he loves him to death. It is not even a ‘but.’ It’s just ‘I love him to death.’ With family, it’s no matter what.”

“We’re very excited to be here tonight,” Grizzly Bear’s Ed Drost said to an ocean of fans Friday at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
The Coachella crowd reacts to music in the Sahara Tent this weekend. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
“LCD Soundsystem, Jay-Z, Fever Ray … Is it too much?” he asked with a grin.
The answer turned out to be yes, actually. The January announcement of the festival’s notably rich 2010 lineup had been the talk of music blogs and magazines for months.
Unsurprisingly, over 75,000 people snatched three-day passes, selling out the festival just days beforehand. In spite of capacity concerns from festival veterans, event organizer Goldenvoice seemed more than happy to open the gates to the largest weekend audience the festival has ever brought together.
The sun hung low in the air Friday, baking the Empire Polo Fields with radiation as the early birds trickled in, filling the stages faster than at previous festivals.
When P.O.S. entered the Gobi tent at 1:25 p.m. to deliver a rousing set of hip-hop, the crowd was already spilling out of the tent’s side entrances. The Minneapolis rapper, visibly stunned by the human sprawl, thanked the audience profusely for its attendance.
This sort of shock became a motif throughout the weekend.
Boston electro-pop outfit Passion Pit was similarly surprised to see the size of the crowd that had assembled in the Outdoor Theatre to hear the band’s set in the coveted sunset slot Friday evening. Vocalist Michael Angelakos remarked that the crowd was the largest the band had ever played to. The turnout seemed to invigorate the band, fueling the members to a fist-pumping finish.
The energy in the fields grew throughout the night. Grizzly Bear gave the tracks of Veckatimest new life under sinister green lights, LCD Soundsystem brought its disco punk dance party to the Main Stage and Fever Ray unleashed her tribal electronica upon the Mojave tent near midnight with demonic costumes and a frightening laser show to enhance the experience.
By Saturday, the excitement brought on by the large crowds began to crumble into mass frustration. Festivalgoers became visibly confrontational, pushing their way toward the stage barriers as early as 4:25 p.m., when indie poster kids Beach House showcased its icy dream pop in the Mojave tent.
While polarizing alt-rock veterans Coheed and Cambria and Faith No More took the main stage, the Outdoor Theatre again drew a growing audience as Pitchfork darlings the xx and Hot Chip delivered respective sets of atmospheric sex rock and funky electronica.
As the sun disappeared behind the mountains, The xx’s Oliver Sim pointed to the main stage where a small fire had broken out, already releasing a stream of black smoke into the sky.
After dark, the experience of navigating between stages began to feel like being an extra in Spartacus. With tens of thousands roaming the grounds — not to mention the throngs of ketamine-eyed teenagers splayed on the grass outside the Sahara tent as trance D.J.s Kaskade and David Guetta pounded away — the act of simply drifting from Muse’s melodramatic, distortion-heavy headlining set on the main stage to Devo’s New Wave throw down in the Mojave tent was an act of remarkable physical endurance.
On Sunday morning, Indio coffee shops were packed with concert attendees, visibly exhausted and storing up energy for the final day, headlined by Damon Albarn’s much-hyped Gorillaz project. Once again, the Outdoor Theatre became a mob scene by sunset, as Sigur Ros frontman Jónsi began the night with a deeply moving set of songs, his cherub-like vocal highs piercing the warm air with aural beauty.
French rockers Phoenix followed with an infectiously fun set, playing heavily from its recent pop masterpiece Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. Frontman Thomas Mars leapt into the euphoric crowd twice along with several inflatable animals.
The night — perhaps even the festival — ultimately belonged to Thom Yorke. Under tubes of light and backed by his supergroup Atoms for Peace (boasting Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, among others), the Radiohead frontman played from his solo album The Eraser, giving the songs incredible passion and diverse emotional power.
As if his first set were not enough, Yorke returned to the stage after 10 p.m. for an encore of Radiohead favorites “Airbag” and “Everything In Its Right Place.”
Gorillaz, with lackluster energy and unimaginative video-screen animation, paled in comparison, playing to a largely bored crowd.
Without transcendent sets from artists like Yorke and Fever Ray, the weekend would have been nothing more than a failed experiment in crowd control. Coachella has clearly outgrown its independent roots, but in order for the festival to preserve its friendly communal atmosphere, serious revisions need to be made. If Goldenvoice is unwilling to sell fewer tickets, then perhaps a larger grounds or even a sixth stage might be in order.
However the event organizer decides to address its capacity issues, the future of the festival will hang in uneasy balance for those that remember its more pleasant years.
2010’s overselling of the event is a dangerous step toward the reckless commercialization that made Woodstock ’99 a disaster.
Unless such problems are addressed by the festival organizers, it won’t be long before someone gets seriously hurt.

Comic book companies doing tie-ins for movies is nothing new. Warner Brothers owns DC Comics, so various adaptations or companion comics come out through the various imprints of the company. However, the recent partnership between Dark Horse Comics and Hammer Films is one to get excited about.
Dark Horse and Hammer Films are names that hold weight independent of each other.
Dark Horse Comics is one of the major publishers in the comic book industry, and one with a very diverse catalogue. They are known for great horror and suspense series, including Mike Mignola’s Hellboy and Arvid Nelson’s Rex Mundi.
Hammer Films is most known for their genre-defining horror films during the 1950s and 1960s. Hammer was to that time what Universal was to the 1930s and 1940s — the premier horror studio. Classic monsters like The Wolfman and Frankenstein came to life, and Christopher Lee gave his iconic performances as Dracula under the Hammer banner. Collaboration between the two of these companies is exciting news to film and comics fans alike.
So far, the union seems to be off to a good start. The first product of the collaboration is a companion piece for the upcoming film Let Me In. The film is the American remake of the Swedish film Let the Right One In — a smart, interesting vampire film. The remake is a bit precarious, but Matt Reeves, the director of Cloverfield, is behind it, so it has a strong chance of being good. The companion piece is set to be written by Marc Andreyko, also a very talented comic book writer. All signs point to this being a fruitful collaboration.
The pairing of Dark Horse and Hammer could lead to some very interesting directions. In additions to new projects from Hammer, there might also be a chance that the classic films of the 1950s and 1960s will get comic adaptations. New stories of Christopher Lee’s Dracula? The Wolfman? Some classic psychological thrillers? One can only hope.
I love Rex Mundi and all the awesome comics Arvid Nelson writes.

If you were to scour Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary to find a word most fitting to describe USC tailback C.J. Gable, perseverance might suffice.
That is because Gable, a fourth year junior, is on track to earn his degree next month and will graduate with the rest of his class according to a report from the Orange County Register.
“It means a lot,” Gable told Michael Lev of the Register. “Everybody’s real proud of me. [My family] wanted me to play football, but most importantly they wanted me to graduate. And I’m doing that.”
After a disappointing 2009 season under former coach Pete Carroll in which he carried the ball just 24 times for 102 yards, Gable could have bolted for the NFL in January like many of his fellow draft-eligible teammates — Everson Griffen and Joe McKnight.
But instead, Gable, who coincidently became the first true freshman in USC history to start a season opener at running back in 2006, decided to stick around, and now, it’s beginning to pay dividends on and off the field.
Although the value of a college degree can never be overvalued, Gable is also getting the chance to have a bounce back season for the Trojans in 2010 under new coach Lane Kiffin, who declared that there was no depth chart going into spring practice — thus presenting him with the chance to get more carries in the fall.
If his past is any indication, it’s clear that Gable won’t let such an opportunity go to waste, as he plans to persist.
“Never give up,” Gable said. It’s going to be hard at first, but it’s going to pay off in the end, big time, (in) anything you do. Like last year. I was angry (about not playing), but I didn’t show it. I came out here and did what I had to do.”

In American Psycho, ruthless Wall Street businessmen flash their version of ivory-crusted pistols: business cards. The small pieces of paper wielding their name and profession in different shades of off-white, with slight font variations, makes a difference in caliber — in quality.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
In today’s business world, the weapon that distinguishes individuals from one another is instead the cell phone.
Be it the hip iPhone, businesslike Blackberry or the media-driven Droid, the model of your phone and whether or not it has “smart” capabilities, including access to the Internet, e-mail and applications, can be considered the burgeoning determinant of an individual’s net worth.
This trend has thus created a strange and obnoxious cellular caste system that has created a fleet of people pathetically tethered to their mobile device, which carries with them an often costly data plan.
The fascination starts young, too ­— countless college students have fancy phones in tow, sometimes not realizing that it costs around $30 a month for them to stealthily update their Facebook profiles during class. That adds up to $360 a year. It’s a pretty uniform rate too, among basic data plans for Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T.
As they advance their careers, they’ll get used to having music, GPS and Facebook instantly, and both their peers and employers will assume they have that capability as well.
Even college professors have all but assumed that anyone who’s worth anything has e-mail and Google on their person at all times. Employers expect those who work for them to answer urgent e-mail queries right away. Eyebrows raise in shock when someone has been in class for more than two hours and not responded to an e-mail.
Whipping out a clam phone circa 2005 will solicit guffaws from board members, ridicule from classmates and not meet the demands of an increasingly competitive workplace.
Marketers have sniffed a youth market in which many have grown accustomed to handheld smart phones. Windows unveiled the new Kin One and Kin Two phones this month, smart phones meant for the 15 to 25 demographic.
It’s what Wired magazine’s gadget blog is calling “social-media-centric” and has Twitter and Facebook feeds as its central feature on its egg-like interface.
Based on Windows 7 technology, the Kin’s distinguishing characteristic is that it automatically puts all of a user’s information, such as texts, e-mails and instant messages, onto an exclusive website accessible on more than one platform.
As young adults, do you really need a standing account of all of your tweets and posts — and to pay more than $300 a year to keep them?
And it wouldn’t hurt to gain relevant information, say, from a computer. Or, God forbid, a book.
The practice of selling both expensive phones and expensive services (data plans) is simply unfair. Yes, the practice of selling a product in demand at inflated prices is a common practice of good old capitalism, but one must question the product itself.
Sure, there is no way to make every American buy a smart phone (the tiny processors can cost upward of $250 or more), but the data plans should not significantly add a lump to a cell phone bill or be a way of weeding out viable social or professional contacts.
The Internet is filled with useless drivel — videos of chubby babies, mindless Facebook poke wars and silly games. That kind of instant access to information that could make or break professional and social interactions is the kind of gold everyone should be privy to, such as the dictionary, GPS and e-mail.
The pressure to be able to extract information and directly communicate with one another at the touch of a button is appalling. There is simply nothing wrong with responding to an e-mail later than within the hour.
This culture reinforces our young generation with a total instant gratification problem. What will happen if they don’t get or can’t find something within the next five keystrokes? Being out of the loop of current information on a constant basis puts those with slimmer wallets at a distinct disadvantage in the workplace. And though money has always had an influence on success, the silly obstacle of not having an iPhone has nothing to do with work ethic or skill set, but rather the size, model and speed of a handheld device.
Perpetuating a culture that classifies its population by looking at what’s at its ear, however, is just a petty exercise in what is electronic elitism.
Clare Sayas is a junior majoring in public relations. Her column “Spitting Cents” ran every other Tuesday.
This article is all over the place…
Is the author claiming the problem is Smart Phone “Elitism” – is an issue of keeping up with the Joneses on the latest and greatest tech gear OR is the author saying there is too much media overload and connectivity expectation in our everyday lives? These are two different issues.
The author also claims — “The practice of selling both expensive phones and expensive services (data plans) is simply unfair. Yes, the practice of selling a product in demand at inflated prices is a common practice of good old capitalism, but one must question the product itself.” — I am not quite sure what is unfair about this. This smacks of typical tween sense of entitlement and naiveté. The tech industry is an extremely competitive business with millions invested in R&D continuously to come up with the next big thing. Perhaps the writer and Michael Moore can go live in North Korea where capitalism is poo-poo’d and things are cheap because nothing is worth paying a price for.
It is also funny to think that so much attention and judgement is based on the phone people have clapped against the side of their head. At USC I would say you are more likely to be “judged” on the clothes you wear, car you drive, how fat or thin, do you have a big butt…honestly after all this other pre-screen info is scanned and noted by people (which usually takes a few seconds and you know you have done it as well) – then POSSIBLY people will care what kind of phone you own.
Relax Clare – whip out that Motorola Razr and go about your day – no one cares – really.

The USC track and field team performed well in a field containing some of the world’s best athletes at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays, coming away with several first place finishes and strong showings.
Double threat · Freshman Reggie Wyatt ran a season-best 50.45 in the 400-meter hurdles and also ran in USC’s champion 4x400-meter team. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“There were a lot of good performances out there,” USC coach Ron Allice said. “I thought we had a pretty solid weekend.”
Senior sprinter Ahmad Rashad highlighted those performances by winning the men’s 100-meter dash with a wind-aided time of 10.08 seconds. Rashad’s sprint is the second-best collegiate time all season, and his first place finish was even more impressive considering he ran in the same heat as 2008 Olympic sprinter Rodney Martin.
Sophomore sprinter Joey Hughes added to USC’s first place finishes at Mt. Sac, winning the men’s 400-meter dash with a time of 45.37.
In addition to being the fastest time at the Invitational, the time placed Hughes fifth in the world, second in the country and eighth on the Trojans’ all-time list in the event.
The USC hurdlers also made their presence felt. Junior Brendan Ames finished first in the men’s 110-meter high hurdles with a time of 13.80, a new personal best. Freshman Reggie Wyatt also ran his best time of the season in the men’s 400-meter intermediate hurdles, a 50.45 that was good enough for a second place finish behind two-time NCAA champion Jeshua Anderson of Washington State.
Hughes and Wyatt, along with redshirt sophomore Bryshon Nellum and senior Nate Anderson ,made up the men’s 4×400-meter relay team, which closed the Mt. Sac Invitational with a winning time of 3:03.70.
“All four of those guys ran great legs,” Allice said. “It was really the ultimate team effort.”
For the USC women, senior Elizabeth Olear won the 400-meter dash with a time of 53.95, a second better than her previous personal record. Senior hurdler Shalina Clarke also had a solid day, placing third with a time of 13.38 in the women’s 100-meter high hurdles.
Next up for USC is the Triton Invitational on April 23, hosted by UC San Diego, and the USC-UCLA dual meet the following week. Allice said the meet helped prepare USC for the rest of the season.
“Now we start evaluating where we stand as far as the dual meet and within the conference,” Allice said. “We now have a much clearer picture than we did before. From here on in, it’s championship time.”

The USC women’s golf team is holding its own at a talent-heavy Pac-10 championships at the Eugene Country Club in Eugene, Ore.
The Women of Troy sit just one stroke back after the first day of play after getting strong performances from their entire roster.
USC is matched up against five of the top 20 teams in the nation this week, including No. 1 Arizona State and No. 2 UCLA. Another, Oregon, is playing in its own hometown. But make no mistake: the Women of Troy intend to win.
Curtain call · Senior Belen Mozo, playing in her final Pac-10 event, shot a opening-round 72, good enough to tie her for ninth overall.  - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
“I think we’re ready to bring another championship home,” said two-time All-American junior Lizette Salas.
Leading the team into the postseason is sophomore Jennifer Song, the No. 2 golfer in the country.
Song, who shot a first round of two-under-par 70, leads the nation in scoring average at 70.63 strokes per round and already has two victories as an individual this year.
If she maintains that average, she will break the school season scoring record that she already holds by .92 strokes. Song will leave USC at the end of the season to turn pro and wants to end her final season as an amateur with an NCAA championship, something she has not yet achieved.
Salas, a junior, was on the NCAA championship-winning team in 2008. That team won its last four events, including all three postseason tournaments.
Salas shot a team-best 3 under par on Monday.
“We expect to play better than we did at [the ASU/PING Invitational], because we left a lot of shots out there,” Salas said “I think we took the wrong approach to certain shots, and we need to be more alert to the type of shot we have to make.”
Salas finished tied for sixth place at ASU and won an individual title at the Turtle Bay classic in Hawaii in November.
Three-time All-American senior Belen Mozo is looking to become the first four-time All-American in USC history. Finally healthy after battling injuries throughout the fall, Mozo shot even par during the first round.
Rounding out USC’s first day was senior Caroline Kim (4-over-par 76) and freshman Cyna Rodriguez (1-over-par 73).
Kim’s final season with the team has been highlighted by a 30th-place finish at the Mason Rudolph Championship in September. Rodriguez’s best tournament was the Bruin Wave, where she finished 15th. Both have fought for a roster spot all season with senior Stefanie Endstrasser and sophomore Inah Park and look to make the most of this postseason opportunity.
The Women of Troy said they are well aware of the expectations that come with their program. The team has finished in the top-seven at the NCAA championships nine times in the last 12 years, including victories in 2003 and 2008.
USC is confident they can continue the tradition of success in Eugene and beyond.
“We all know the course really well,” Salas said. “We’re all really excited about this.”

What does it take to be No. 1?
Apparently more than whatever USC junior cornerback T.J. Bryant and sophomore wide receiver De’Von Flournoy have been doing this spring.
Lane Kiffin stripped the players of their jersey numbers (No. 1) last week because he felt they were not meeting the standard of the number set by former USC All-American wide receiver Mike Williams.
Williams caught 176 passes in his two-year Trojan career for a combined 2,579 yards and 30 touchdowns in 2002 and 2003. His 95 receptions in 2003 are the most ever in a single season by a USC receiver not named Keyshawn Johnson.
Williams’ time at USC was cut short by fluctuating NFL draft rules that blocked him from entering the draft or returning to college ball, but he clearly left his mark here at USC.
But, to steal a phrase from The 40-Year-Old Virgin, should Kiffin be putting his number on a pedestal?
Williams was a great wide receiver during his days as a Trojan, but I don’t see a No. 1 hanging in the Coliseum next to No. 3, 5, 11, 12, 20, 32 or 33. That’s because Williams’ number was never retired.
And last time I checked, numbers that aren’t retired are up for grabs.
For obvious reasons, Kiffin has close ties to Williams. The USC coach was in charge of wide receivers during Williams’ brilliance on the field and pushed Williams to earn All-American first team honors in 2003.
But it’s an uncertainty as to whether or not Williams was even the best Trojan wide receiver that Kiffin coached in his first stint at USC.
Kiffin also coached Dwayne Jarrett, USC’s first two-time All-American wideout in 2005 and 2006. Jarrett’s college career was so successful that he topped Williams’ 176 receptions and set his own USC record of 216. Jarrett also set the Pac-10 record for career touchdown catches with 39.
Block number · USC coach Lane Kiffin changed the numbers of junior cornerback T.J. Bryant and sophomore wide receiver De’Von Flournoy. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
But his jersey — No. 8 — seems to be used by players without any comment from the coaching staff.
And how about Jarrett’s partner in crime, Steve Smith?
Smith earned All-American honors in 2006 and has had by far the best NFL career of the trio. He’s arguably Eli Manning’s most valuable receiver on the New York Giants, and his 172 career receptions in the NFL blow away Williams’ career total of 44.
But Kiffin doesn’t mind players wearing Smith’s old No. 2 at all.
I don’t mean to downplay Williams’ achievements at USC. He helped bring Trojan football back to national prominence and ended his college career with a national championship, and was a vital piece to the great teams under Pete Carroll’s reign.
But should a USC football player have to earn No. 1 before he can wear it on the field?
Carroll didn’t think so, and neither do I.
After his glory days at USC, Williams tanked in the NFL. He was often criticized for being out of shape and unmotivated.
When Carroll, now coaching the Seattle Seahawks, invited Williams to camp this year for a possible comeback, Williams admitted that he, again, wasn’t in shape and had done “nothing important” in the past three years.
He likely won’t make the team.
That’s not really a role model you want to motivate players with.
A Trojan shouldn’t wear       No. 5, 3, 11 or any of the other USC Heisman winners’ numbers for valid reasons. Those numbers are retired. They are enshrined. Those jerseys represent the best in the college football world and should be untouched forever.
Williams’ No. 1 doesn’t fit in that category.
Bryant and Flournoy were reportedly informed of the decision via text message from an assistant coach, and both players were upset with the outcome.
I would be too.
“Soft Hands” runs on Tuesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Jon at jhaber@usc.edu.
Although I agree maybe #1 was not the most valuable player number based on past performances, isn’t there a statement in the use of #1 as a reference to being the best? If this applied to being the best on offense that I think they should have to earn the #1 jersey just as the defense has to earn the #55 jersey. And although, #55 is representative of some of the best former defensive players, who BTW did NOT receive Heisman awards, the best of course on offense having already retired numbers, I would think the #1 jersey would be the ONLY appropriate “EARNED” jersey number for an offensive player.

USC looks to snap its six-game losing streak tonight at Dedeaux Field when it hosts UC Santa Barbara in non-conference action at 7 p.m.
The Trojans (15-20, 2-10) suffered their second straight series sweep last weekend — this time at the hands of   Pac-10 leader Arizona State. After taking a 4-1 lead in the first inning of Sunday’s series finale, USC allowed 11 unanswered runs to the Sun Devils (31-3, 9-3) and dropped its 10th game in its last 13 contests by a score of 14-6.
Slick fielding · Sophomore infielder Ricky Oropesa leads the Trojans in a number of statistical categories, including home runs and RBI. Oropesa has also been solid for the USC in the field, holding a .997 fielding percentage on 307 chances. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
USC coach Chad Kreuter has a few options that he can turn to for starters tonight. Sophomore right-hander Chad Smith lasted only one and one-third innings in Sunday’s outing, allowing five runs on five hits with two walks.
Junior righty Logan Odom pitched two innings of relief Sunday, but he might be ready to start tonight as well. Odom (0-0, 6.14 ERA) last started against Cal State Bakersfield on April 7 where he gave up two runs in two innings.
Kreuter could also go with senior Kevin Couture — who did not start over the weekend but pitched in relief Sunday — or senior Shuhei Fujiya, who failed to record an out in his only start of the season March 30 against Loyola Marymount.
The Gauchos (16-14, 3-3) come into tonight’s contest having dropped their weekend series to Cal State Fullerton after losing the rubber game Sunday 6-1.
UCSB will likely start junior Greg Davis. In his last start against Loyola Marymount, Davis (1-0, 2.63 ERA) lasted three innings without giving up a hit. He struck out three.
UCSB is batting .291 on the season with a staff ERA of 5.02, compared to USC’s team average of .284 and 4.75 ERA.
Sophomore infielder Ricky Oropesa continues to pace the way for the Trojans’ offense, leading the team in batting average (.321), hits (45), doubles (12), home runs (11) and RBI (34). He is also second on the team with 29 runs scored.
On the other side, the Gauchos have a few top hitters USC pitchers need to keep in check. Five of their starters have a batting average of .297 or better.
Infielder Matt Valaika leads the Gauchos with a .327 batting average, 24 runs scored and 25 RBI, to go along with his four home runs. Infielder Trevor Whyte is tied for second on the team with 21 RBI. He also sports a .309 batting average. Infielder Gunnar Terhune has a .304 average, 23 runs scored, 21 RBI and six stolen bases.
USC is hoping to notch a much-needed win tonight before it travels to Eugene, Ore., to take on the Ducks this weekend. The Trojans have yet to win a Pac-10 series this season.
Kreuter has another option to resign his position as head coach.

Art has the power to encourage people, universities and even nations to change their ways. It has the power to introduce new ideas — ideas that lead to unlimited change and transformation. As military and diplomatic efforts are beginning to fail in the war-torn nation of Afghanistan, the powerful force of art is taking its best shot at reforming the nation into a peaceful, modern state.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
A new influence is beginning to take root in Afghanistan. It’s not a political figure, religious leader, ideology or even an organization. It’s Bollywood — the musical and fantasy-like Indian movie industry.
Images of love-stricken couples dancing in mountains singing in high-pitched voices and manly heroes saving innocent young women from the clutches of evil-looking villains fill the screen at the movie theaters still operating in Afghanistan.
At first glance, many might shrug their shoulders and wonder why Bollywood’s increased presence is a big deal. The most immediate reason is that young men in their 20s usually fill up the seats — men that can’t find work and are looking for a place to spend their time. Radical preachers and militants find easy recruits in idle men who are frustrated with their socioeconomic positions, thereby making Bollywood an alternative (but temporary) refuge for those upset with their present conditions.
Bollywood provides these men with not only a hobby that doesn’t lead to radicalization but also a window for them to witness the world beyond their war-torn homes — a modern world in which people live comfortably with modern amenities, safety and food.
Under the Taliban regime, Bollywood movies were banned in the nation. Following the militia’s collapse in 2001, however, Bollywood movies and music were the first to make their way into Afghan marketplaces. Accused of being anti-Islamic because they show women without hijabs (traditional head coverings), men and women interacting in public and on-screen singing and dancing, Bollywood movies were seen as a threat to Taliban rule.
By viewing the possibilities and rewards of modernism in Bollywood movies, some believe the movies could play a role in motivating young Afghans to work harder in improving their nation and bringing it up to par with other developing nations in the region. According to some experts, Bollywood offers Afghans a glimpse of what a modern Afghanistan could look like — an image that appeals to the vast majority of average Afghans.
Another practical benefit to Afghans is that Bollywood producers have indicated they might consider Afghanistan as a possible location to shoot songs that are set in natural settings. Bollywood, which produces an average of 1,000 movies per year, routinely films in environments such as the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland, beaches of South Africa, the deserts of Egypt and the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. Afghanistan has a vast selection of natural wonders ranging from mountains to deserts, leading many Bollywood directors to consider traveling to the nation for movie shooting. It is a lot cheaper than other nations, and geographically it isn’t that far from India. This would provide many jobs to local Afghans — something the nation desperately needs.
However, Bollywood’s future could have some hurdles to cross before it stays for good. Recently, the Afghan parliament began to encourage the ban of Indian soap operas in Afghanistan because of reasons similar to the Taliban’s ban years earlier. They pointed toward the women who weren’t fully covered, singing and other so-called “anti-Islamic” qualities of the soap operas. Several presidents of various T.V. channels, as well as the public, have voiced dissent, but it appears as though their voices will be quelled.
Though it is true that the banning of Indian soap operas can be interpreted as a threat to Afghanistan’s journey to modernity, it can also be looked upon as evidence that the power of art — in this case cinema — is beginning to have a significant enough impact on the thoughts of the population that the more stringent Islamic members of parliament are voicing their concern.
It is imperative that the United States, along with non-governmental organizations and other concerned groups, continue to advocate for Bollywood and other foreign art forms to be freely displayed in Afghanistan. Its impact on the lives of average citizens cannot be underestimated.
Art has the power to influence individuals and introduce them to different lifestyles, points of view and belief systems that previously would have remained unknown.
The art of Bollywood is beginning to take root and have effect on the ideas of many young Afghans, thereby planting the seeds of ideological change in the future.

President Barack Obama will be in Los Angeles today to help raise money for Sen. Barbara Boxer’s re-election campaign, in a race which is already shaping up to be a tough battle.
Obama will attend a fundraiser at Exposition Park, right across the street from campus, a reception at the California Science Museum and a dinner at the Natural History Museum.
Tickets to the reception cost between $250 and $2,500 and entrance to the dinner costs $35,200 per couple.
Boxer and the Democratic National Committee will divide the proceeds, which are expected to reach $3.5 million.
The President will arrive by helicopter, but several sections of Figueroa Street, Exposition Boulevard and Flower Street will still be closed from 5:15 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.
The visit will cause problems for USC Transportation, which has issued warnings about increased traffic and road closures near campus. Transportation services including Campus Cruiser and USC Tram service will be limited during the evening.
According to the Los Angeles Independent, several anti-war groups will also be at the site to protest U.S. Presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to show support for Obama’s decision to remove all troops from Iraq by 2011. In attendance as well will be members of March Forward!, an anti-war group comprised of veterans and active duty service members.
