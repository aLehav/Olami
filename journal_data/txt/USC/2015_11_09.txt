Following a resolution passed by the Academic Senate, student leaders and administrators are engaged in an ongoing discussion over potentially deferring greek recruitment to the spring semester for freshman students.
Representatives of the Interfraternity Council met with administrators last Tuesday to discuss the proposed changes. Panhellenic Council members met with administration on Monday.
On Sept. 30, the Academic Senate unanimously passed a proposal to defer greek recruitment. The proposal also requires transfer students to wait to rush until they have obtained a USC GPA. The Academic Senate hopes this will ease recruitment for students on both sides of the process, but greek leaders are opposed to both the proposal and the way the resolution was reached.
This proposal is not an action or policy adopted by the administration. Instead, it expresses the opinion of the USC faculty and is serving as a formal impetus for a conversation about greek recruitment at USC. This conversation is led by Ainsley Carry, vice president for Student Affairs, whose main focus is easing the transition into college for new students.
“We want to give new students a softer place to land when they come to college,” Carry said. “What is so bad about that idea? We want to make sure you feel comfortable before we put you in the game. I can’t see what’s wrong with that.”
The Senate attributed its concerns to a nationwide pattern of decreasing mental health and academic performance in first-year students. This pattern is reflected at USC, and many faculty members feel that it is especially true in the 45 percent of new students who participate in fall recruitment.
Academic Senate President Ginger Clark said that many professors feel that the recruitment process hits students too hard and too fast in their first weeks in a new college environment. Many are adjusting to life on their own, far from their families. In the Senate’s opinion, the week-long process of rush — followed by a period of pledging for many fraternities — provides too rigorous of an environment for new students.
“We know that grades suffer during the rush period,” Clark said. “We know that there is a lot of stress reported to us due to the rigorous social expectations, as well as the fear of being rejected. And then there is the impact of not being accepted for those who are not chosen. All of this in one’s first semester as an independent young adult? It doesn’t make sense.”
For senior Jake Simon, president of the Interfraternity Council, the proposal came as a surprise. The Senate and other members of the administration approached Simon and other chapter presidents in the past for informal conversations about the pros and cons of moving greek recruitment. However, Simon did not feel that the Senate gathered an adequate amount of student opinions to make an informed decision.
“What we’re mostly upset about is that, up until a few weeks ago, there was absolutely no student involvement here,” Simon said. “There’s a lot to be discussed when it comes to moving recruitment, and we need to be involved with that.”
Simon’s concern is shared by the Undergraduate Student Government, which is coordinating between the greek organizations and the administration. USG President Rini Sampath said that USG has yet to take an official stance on the proposal, but that they are prepared to make a formal statement in the future in support of what is most beneficial for students.
“My biggest concern is that the student voice isn’t being heard in this process,” Sampath said. “Our number one priority, regardless of their position on the proposal, is supporting the students this is going to impact first and foremost and ensuring that their concerns are being heard at the administrative level.”
Carry hopes to finalize conversations surrounding recruitment by the end of this semester. If he reaches the conclusion at that time that deferred recruitment is the best option, that policy will be implemented for the 2016-2017 school year. This means that sororities and fraternities would be expected to overhaul their recruitment processes in less than a year.
This timeline for deferred recruitment raises many concerns for the IFC presidents and chapters, including financial challenges for smaller fraternities who rely on fall recruitment to generate revenue and bring residents into their houses. These concerns are echoed by the Panhellenic Council, which also fears that deferring recruitment would complicate the process for active members and lead to potential “dirty rushing.”
The current formal sorority recruitment process takes place during the first week of enrollment. For active members, this week is preceded by a “polish” week to prepare for recruitment. According to Panhellenic Council President Caroline Cannan, moving this process to the spring would be a drastic and difficult transition for every sorority.
In order to prepare for recruitment, active members would have to return from winter break a week early, creating a logistical difficulty for out-of-state and international students. In the meantime, Cannan said that deferred recruitment increases the probability of “dirty rushing” — situations where potential new members interact with active members, either innocently or in the hopes of boosting their chances of success during rush.
On top of these concerns, the Panhellenic Council holds their positions for a calendar year,  spending their first semester preparing for recruitment. This schedule would be entirely flipped, and the council’s timeline and leadership would have to adjust as well.
“I can’t imagine a smooth transition into it at all,” Cannan said. “Pushing it to the spring semester, you’re still going to have the same difficulties. Classes still exist, responsibilities still exist. I don’t think it will solve our problems.”
Concerns such as this are why both sides believe that the past three weeks’ meetings only serve as the beginning for a widened discussion. And during these conversations, both Carry and Clark emphasize that the Senate’s proposal is not meant to be “anti-greek.” Their hope is to analyze a significant portion of the new student process and to open this topic up for a campus-wide discussion in order to improve as a college community.
“I know it provides tremendous benefit to our University,” Carry said. “The Greek community creates a tremendous amount of good. I wish everyone could have that intimate interaction and engagement with a group of people. We need to lift it up. But we can’t ignore what is happening. We need to look at the process as a whole and start asking questions.”

Richard Montañez’s voice boomed through the room as his intense gaze met the eyes of several dozen students. Gesturing with his hands and speaking with complete conviction, Montañez told the crowd that when he was growing up in Guasti, a small town near Ontario, California, one moment in the second grade changed his life.
“At my school, everyone spoke English, and I didn’t know English,” Montañez said. “On the first day, when I pulled out my burrito for lunch, everyone stared at me — and I put it back in the bag, because I was embarrassed. I wanted to be like everyone else.”
But when Montañez went home and told his mom that he didn’t want to be different, she told him something that stuck with him.
“She said, ‘No, mijo, this is who you are’ — and the next day, she made me two burritos,” Montañez said.
On Monday night, Montañez addressed the Latina/o Student Assembly in a talk that covered his journey at PepsiCo, from working as a janitor at a Frito-Lay plant to serving as the executive vice president of multicultural sales and community activation for PepsiCo North America. As the inventor of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, Montañez discussed his pride in his Latino heritage as well as his determination to succeed when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds.
Montañez, who never completed high school and made his way through the corporate world without a college degree, stressed the importance of pursuing the education that he was never able to attain.
“When I was a kid, I didn’t know how to dream — my generation weren’t dreamers,” Montañez said. “Our fathers and grandfathers weren’t dreamers, because they didn’t have time to dream — they were too busy working. The generations that came before me kicked down the door for me, but you don’t need to kick down that door, because you have the key: your education.”
While working as a janitor at the Rancho Cucamonga Frito-Lay plant in the 1970s, Montañez came up with the idea of creating snack products specifically marketed toward Hispanics, a market that hadn’t been touched by an American company at that point. Taking the initiative, Montañez developed his own recipe for what would later turn into Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, and pitched his idea to the plant’s CEO.
“There’s one thing you need to start a revolution: a revelation,” Montañez said. “There are so many ideas in front of us that nobody else can see. You have to be a leader and a visionary in seeing what no one else can see.”
Today, Montañez teaches leadership to MBA students, delivers keynote speeches at universities around the country and has met several U.S. presidents and spoken at the United Nations. He runs two charitable foundations, Kits for Kids and Feed the Children, and gives away college scholarships to young Latinos. According to Montañez, the secret to success is to embrace what makes you unique, as well as to have confidence in taking the initiative.
“I never once went looking for money,” Montañez said. “It just so happened that money found me. The first thing that I wanted was happiness, and I wanted to be respected, but you have to respect yourself first.”
Ultimately, Montañez emphasized that although it’s important for students not to let their background — zip code, skin color, or education level — define them, minorities should also never forget their heritage. When asked if he had ever considered going back to school, Montañez said he had decided not to — even if lacking a degree made him ineligible for a CEO position — because it “wouldn’t be him.”
“I’m proud of you being here and trying to get an education,” Montañez said. “I don’t have an education. But I’m the most brilliant uneducated person you will ever meet.”

Students gathered in McCarthy Quad Monday morning for a DIY De-Stressing Workshop hosted by the Environmental Student Assembly, Special Events Committee and Academic Culture Assembly.
The event kicked off ESA’s Healthy Living Week, which takes place from Nov. 9 to Nov. 13.
Students had various activities to choose from such as a free yoga class, DIY arrowroot deodorant, DIY charcoal and bentonite clay face masks, DIY inspiration jars, DIY lavender eye masks and soothing tea from Rewts.
“This event gives students an opportunity to relax, take a break from their busy days and do fun non-stressful activities,” said Elizabeth Bricker, director of SEC.
Larkin Wynn, a student ambassador for ESA, helped students create their masks and deodorant.
“This is the first of our workshops for our Healthy Living Week,” she said. “Right now, we are trying to show students that there are ways to be natural while also being able to relax at the same time.”
Wynn said that the event comes during a time of high stress for many students.
“We’re applying ESA’s mission of bringing sustainable practices to campus while also helping students de-stress, which is hard for them right now with the endless midterm season that’s going on,” Wynn said.
As students milled around, sipping tea and making stress-relieving products, others participated in a open-air yoga class, which took place on the grass in the quad.
“I think this is a really cool event. I think it’s a really important thing, especially right now, as the coming weeks are very stressful, so it’s nice to be able to vent,” said Bella Shary, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism.
Shary said there could have been more publicity for the event.
“The only criticism I have is perhaps that the organizers could have advertised the event more,” she said. “I only knew about the event because my friend told me about it.”
Other events being held during Healthy Living Week include a healthy food fair, a composting workshop, yoga under the stars and an APASA Formal.

Scholarly · Joseph Porter won a diversity scholarship Thursday.– Photo courtesy of Joseph Porter
Joseph Porter IV, a second-year student at the Gould School of Law, won a 2L Diversity Scholarship from the global law firm, Latham & Watkins, on Thursday.
The firm reviewed nearly 300 applications coming from 90 U.S. law schools. A Yale undergraduate and currently member of the Gould School class of 2017, Porter was one of 10 law students chosen to receive this award.
The 2L Diversity Scholarship is one of the firm’s signature initiatives. It includes a $10,000 stipend and a position as a summer associate at Latham & Watkins. This program was implemented in 2005, and since then, it has awarded over $500,000 in scholarships to law students throughout the U.S. The application had students detail their academic and leadership achievements, their previous work and personal experiences, and their commitment to diversity. Other scholarship winners include students from Columbia University, Northwestern University, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Maryland and the University of Virginia.
Manu Gayatrinath, a partner of the firm and the chair of the recruiting committee, said the program aims to provide diverse law students a way to pursue their careers and increase the diversity in the profession.
“It’s really just supposed to be a way for Latham to be at the forefront of ensuring that we’re increasing diversity in the legal profession overall, not just the firm,” she said.
According to Gayatrinath, the law profession tends to be lagging in terms of diversity.
“We really strongly believe that one of the major ways that we can really broaden this community and to have a better voice in this community is by ensuring that we have various viewpoints reflected in all of our teams,” she said. “Over and over again it’s been proven that diversity really leads to better problem solving.”
During the competitive application process, the firm looks for students who have had different experiences from other students at major universities and who show the firm’s values of excellence and character in their personal and work experiences.
“The 10 students we selected represent the very brightest future of our profession,” Bill Voge, chair of Latham & Watkins, wrote on the firm’s website. “Each one possesses a tremendous amount of talent, tenacity, ambition and dedication to the law.”
Porter was initially offered an intern position at Latham & Watkins after he applied in August. Impressed by his application, the firm sent him an email suggesting that he apply for the scholarship, and the very next day he was contacted saying he had won. Porter thought it was a mixture of his previous work experience and his passion for advocating for diversity that got him the scholarship.
“They saw that I was well-rounded and a good person to have working [at their firm], not [that I was] only diverse,” he said.
After earning a bachelor’s degree in political science from Yale University in 2011, Porter worked for three years as a business analyst at Deloitte in New York City. Soon after, he decided it was time to come back home to Southern California. A second- generation Trojan, Porter said the USC emphasis on diversity played a big role in his decision of coming here.
“I don’t think I can speak directly at the undergrad level … but law school generally is not very good at getting diverse candidates, and I think USC is doing a good job in focusing in diversity and making it important to them,” Porter said.
Porter also believes that the law industry tends to be mostly white and uniform. As part of both the Black Law Students Association and the Black Entertainment and Sports Lawyers Association, he is looking to inspire others to make the legal workspace more diverse. He believes law firms can benefit from diversifying, like Latham & Watkins is doing through its scholarship program.
“I’m working in making initiatives that will help more black law school students come to the law firm,” he said. “Having more diverse people helps provide different perspectives because legal work can be really collaborative, and you can understand different points [of view]. All around, having a more diverse community will better the legal work space that you can provide.”
Porter will be interning at Latham & Watkins for 10 weeks during the summer of 2016 and hopes to get a full-time position when he graduates from USC in May 2017.

Drop it like it’s pop · Ellie Goulding returns for her third studio album, Delirium. For Goulding’s latest musical effort, the singer worked with studio heads such as Greg Kurstin, who has produced Adele’s music. – Photo courtesy of Polydor
After a string of smash hits, singer Ellie Goulding is back with the highly anticipated Delirium. The 28-year-old British singer’s breakthrough single, “Lights” was first released in the U.K. in 2010, but it took two years for the song to reach the top 5 in the United States. Since then, Goulding has received attention for singles such as “Anything Could Happen” and “Burn.” With her third studio album, Delirium, however, Goulding breaks free from her original image.
When the release of Delirium was announced back in September, Goulding said, “Part of me views this album as an experiment — to make a big pop album. I made a conscious decision that I wanted it to be on another level.” For Goulding, Delirium tried to achieve exactly that.
Delirium starts with one of Goulding’s most memorable hits to date, her Fifty Shades of Grey song “Love Me Like You Do.” Yet instead of flirting with indie pop and diving head-first into the world of EDM — where she’s had success alongside Calvin Harris — Goulding’s choice of partners in Delirium are some of the biggest producers in pop music. Greg Kurstin, who produced and co-wrote Adele’s comeback single “Hello” and Max Martin, the Swedish music producer behind some of Taylor Swift’s No. 1 hits, have credits on all but two songs. With the wind of the Fifty Shades of Grey backing her and the recruitment of the heaviest hitters she could find, Goulding attempts to reach mainstream pop.
“Aftertaste” opens up the album confidently with a fast- paced pop vibe complemented with drums and a repetitive chorus. It is a nice place to start, and plays right into what she has played over the years. The beat and thumping of “Around U” and “Something In The Way You Move” also feel right on track. However, it is noteworthy that “Something In The Way You Move” has a similar chorus to “Love Me Like You Do,” which could feel like a bit of a misstep, but Delirium does not feel like a careless album at all.
There is a more bittersweet drive on the lead single “On My Mind,” which stands out as an obvious attempt at a more mainstream sound. Goulding reveals her weaknesses on the empowering ballad “Army,” which sounds perfectly fine by itself but is the type of song that pop queens like Katy Perry could turn into a hit. That is the fundamental problem with Delirium — as Goulding attempts to take a shot at the A-list, she is competing with the same singers who use the biggest guns in the industry as their weapons.
Delirium’s mood is upfront. Granted, it is upbeat, but Goulding’s romantic propositions are realistic, unlike the adolescent and yearning questions that are prevalent in mainstream pop. With a track like “Codes,” the sentiment is clear. “Stop talking in codes / stop talking to codes / let me know what’s up / can’t do it no more / I need a love to celebrate,” she sings. In “Don’t Panic,” Goulding sings, “I got big dreams, baby / So don’t you overcomplicate it,” another example of her emotional maturity.
Goulding’s third-studio album manages to be cool and collected. It rarely hyperbolizes what love is. The last song of the album, “Scream It Out,” picks up after a few beats. The song summarizes Goulding’s attempt to lay out her emotions. “I’ve always had a thing for silence / But lately I just need a voice I recognize / Baby, it’s perfect timing now to … / Scream it out, out,” she sings.
Goulding has the formula for success with this third album, but she fails to reach her desired goal even though she did everything right — maybe too right. Her energy and ability to craft great dance music are still present but rebranded into something more emotionally tangible and real. If she is lucky, she won’t have to wait two years this time to achieve a hit.

For years, I have told anybody who would listen that my dream would be to turn the Ocean’s trilogy series — all notoriously male-driven films- — into films comprised of solely women. This isn’t to say that I have problems with the original series. On the contrary, the Steven Soderbergh 2001 reboot is one of my favorite films. However, I always wondered if an audience would think that a similar Las Vegas heist story line, featuring women instead, would be just as suave and charming. I wondered if we could swallow such a change in the female narrative — one where female characters aren’t tied to the kitchen or clerical office jobs. The premise of these films would require a transformation of normal societal bounds — women liberated enough to not only steal, but to also get away with it too. I had little faith that such a remake could ever exist, but this past month, it was announced that Clooney’s production company would be financing another Ocean’s Eleven remake starring — you guessed it — an entirely female cast headed by Sandra Bullock. Upon examination, however, this news isn’t as celebratory as one would hope.
This announcement comes at the head of a string of films that feature female leads in previously male roles, the most recent being another Bullock film entitled Our Brand Is Crisis, which was originally to star Clooney. In the film, Bullock plays the same single bachelor Clooney would’ve played had he taken the part. The role was not rewritten drastically to make way for a husband or kids, but instead allowed Bullock to play the same crisis-managing, career-focused woman she should be allowed to play.
Next month, Julia Roberts stars as an FBI investigator in another female-heavy fast in Secret in their Eyes — a role originally meant to be for two male characters. In response to the gender-swapped role, Roberts stated confidently, “It takes two men to make one me.” Next year, there is also the Ghostbusters remake starring Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, in addition to The Gray Man starring Charlize Theron in a role originally intended for Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton as Marvel’s Doctor Strange. All these casting decisions are positive steps in the right directions when it comes to equality for men and women in the industry.
This change of pace is especially welcome when considering this past weekend’s release of yet another James Bond film. Not only is Daniel Craig’s Bond the typical misogynistic womanizer the series has continued to reinforce for 52 years, but the character of M is now played by yet another white male — a role which was formerly occupied by the powerful Judi Dench until her character’s death in Skyfall. When watching the film, I wondered if there really was any place for a protagonist like Bond in 2015, whose principles and ways in which he deals with women seems outdated to the maximum. It had been three years since I had seen a Bond film of any kind, and I was dismayed to watch just how ridiculous his character really is. Bond tosses women aside left and right, and theoretically “falls in love” with Léa Seydoux’s character at the end — but this character arc stems from no place of reality. The four male screenwriters who wrote the film must’ve had a tough time coming up with motive for this old fashioned Bond because it comes off as forced and improbable when only days prior Bond abandons one woman in a hotel room and inexplicably seduces a grieving widow a few hours later. This is further substantiated when considering that the filmmakers could’ve cast anyone to be the new M — why precisely they went with Ralph Fiennes may never be known. It doesn’t seem like they wanted to work too out of the box. Bond has not been met without criticism, of course, and just this past year waves were made when online outlets and blogs proposed a new actor to play Bond: Idris Elba. Fans were both horrified and ecstatic at the prospect, but I for one believe that the problem doesn’t lie only in the casting, but the role itself.
Therefore, the idea of filling in roles with women where men were previously slotted does raise questions of whether we are truly transcending the confines of gender biases or rather just making quick fixes to fill quotas and push diversity. If the roles are still being written for men initially, then what are the actresses but simply runners-up in the casting game? And with even all those years of wishing and hoping for a female Ocean’s Eleven, I’ve now reached the point where I wonder if it should be done at all — because then the women will simply be compared to the male version once the new one is released, pitted against each other in a male versus female type competition. In turn, there should be an entirely new heist film set somewhere completely different, allowing women their own original treasure to steal and get away with it.
Maybe my idea from so long ago was rooted in wishful thinking and, perhaps, misinformed thinking. In Spectre, the old MI-6 building — which was blown up in the previous Bond installment — is slated for demolition because it’s “cheaper to knock it down than to rebuild.” Part of me wonders if, like MI-6 and like the James Bond character who had made it his home, it would be best to simply start anew than try to redo the old. This goes for Ocean’s Eleven, too.

Coffee with Casey · Senior Casey Prottas’s Instagram feed serves as her personal travel diary and as a coffee spotlight. Prottas was inspired to start the account after interning in London last summer. – Photo courtesy of Casey Prottas
Casey Prottas, a senior majoring in journalism, uses her Instagram as a sort of travel diary — but a very specialized one. Her Instagram account, @coffeeshopcasey, is dedicated to photographing coffee  wherever in the world she is. Her feed features a delightful and creative assortment of photos revolving around the coffee theme, capturing latte art, coffee ice cream and coffee shops in both the United States and England. When she’s not too busy coffee shop hopping all over the world, Prottas enjoys browsing independent book shops, playing board games with her friends and watching classic movies.
Daily Trojan: What inspired you to make an Instagram entirely about coffee and coffee shops?
Prottas: It all started during the summer I spent interning in London, England. I went to a coffee shop there called Kaffeine and had the best conversation with the barista about the London coffee scene, and I was immediately intrigued. I started exploring all over the city and was inspired by each coffee shop’s personality and theme and the locals each would attract. I met all sorts of interesting people and learned a ton about different types of beans, blends and roasts. I’ve always enjoyed taking photos, and I didn’t already have an Instagram, so I thought making a coffee-themed Instagram would be a fun hobby.
DT: What do you think sets your Instagram apart from others’ (other than the coffee)?
CP: I use it as my own personal little travel diary. Whenever I go to a new city, I try and find a unique coffee shop to feature. It’s my way of keeping memories and also motivating myself to get out there and try to live life as the locals do while I’m in a certain place.
DT: Has there ever been a time where you wanted to post something else but felt restricted by the theme?
CP: Not really. I don’t always post just the cup of coffee — I try and mix it up by taking photos of the cool interior of certain coffee shops or by taking my coffee to go and taking the photo with something interesting outside. One of my favorite photos I’ve taken is of my coffee cup at night in Times Square while it was raining.
DT: How did being in the U.K. change the way you view lifestyle, art and culture?
CP: Living in London was life changing. I’ve always appreciated art and culture, and I love what Los Angeles has to offer in terms of these things, but I came across so many unique installations, performances, pieces, writings — the list goes on — that I had never experienced or seen before while I was in London. My British co-workers taught me so much about expressing myself creatively and just doing what makes you happy. They would take me to everything from plays and pop-up shops to live art gatherings on rooftops, and I was blown away by it all.
DT: What are some of your favorite places to travel?
CP: Outside of the U.S. — London, England; Cork, Ireland; Paris, France; Barcelona, Spain; and Brussels, Belgium. I’ve never been to New Zealand or Thailand, but those are the next places I want to go. Inside of the U.S. — New York City, San Francisco, Big Sur and Joshua Tree.
DT: What do you want to do in the future?
CP: I would love to go into television production or the marketing field for a nonprofit or media company.

Moving forward · Senior forward Jamie Fink (left) and junior midfielder Morgan Andrews (right) of the No. 4 seed Women of Troy will host Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the NCAA tournament. – Photo courtesy of Sports Information
The women’s soccer team finished the regular season with a resounding 2-0 road win over UCLA. Now, head coach Keidane McAlpine and his team must wait to see which team they will face in the NCAA Tournament.
The Women of Troy (14-5-1), ranked No. 14 in the country, are a lock to make the tournament and have quite an opportunity to make a championship run.
The program last captured the national title in 2007, defeating perennial powerhouse Florida State 2-0. That same kind of magical run could happen again this year. Every position group is strong, and through 20 games, there are no visible flaws with this team.
Last year, USC made an appearance in the NCAA tournament but was eliminated in the first round. The Women of Troy fell to Pepperdine on penalty kicks in agonizing fashion. There was nothing separating the Waves from the Trojans after 110 minutes, causing a shootout to ensue.
The NCAA Tournament will commence on Nov. 13 and will conclude on Dec. 6. With so many elite teams taking part, it is safe to call this tournament “November Madness.”
The concept of the tournament is essentially the same as March Madness: win or go home. There is no round robin. There are no second chances.
Sixty-four teams compete, but only two will meet on the pitch at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, North Carolina, for all the marbles.
Florida State took home the hardware last season, defeating ACC foe Virginia 1-0 in the title game. The Women of Troy took on the Seminoles early on this season, barely losing but looking awfully promising.
USC legitimized its reputation by following up a strong showing against the reigning national champs. The team went 9-2 in the conference and defeated talented sides like Washington State and Cal.
The team was superb on the road this season, going 7-3. Also, home-field advantage was very real for USC during this campaign, as the team recorded six wins, one tie and zero losses at Soni McAlister Field.
The team has enjoyed a terrific season, but McAlpine and his players could just be getting started.
The No. 4-seeded Women of Troy will host Cal State Fullerton on Friday at 1 p.m. in the first round of the NCAA tournament.

USC women’s volleyball senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio made history on Monday by becoming the first student-athlete in Pac-12 history to earn six weekly awards in one season. The 6-foot-2 outside hitter was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for her play during Nov. 2-8 after averaging 7.36 points per set and leading the No. 2-ranked Women of Troy to a pair of home victories against Colorado and Utah.
The Guadalajara, Mexico, native has now won the award six times out of the 11 weeks of play this season. Furthermore, this is the ninth time in her career to win a weekly award, tying Logan Tom (Stanford, 1999-2002) for second-most    all-time in conference history for career selections.
Over the weekend, Bricio put up big numbers against the Mountain schools to propel her team to victory. She compiled 42 kills (6.00 kps) with just seven total errors for a .422 hitting percentage, while also adding seven service aces (1.00 saps), five blocks (0.71 bps) and 14 digs (2.00 dps). On Friday against Colorado, Bricio had 21 kills and a whopping six aces, marking the 18th time in her career that she has served at least five or more aces in a single match. Two days later, she followed that up with another 21-kill performance against Utah on a stellar .450 hitting clip. Overall, Bricio recorded 51.5 points on the weekend and remains as the nation’s top point scorer with 6.32 points per set.
Already the leading candidate for National Player of the Year, Bricio has also moved up USC’s career record books this season. She took over the top spot in USC history for points scored (2,318.5) two weeks ago in a match against Washington State, and currently sits in second place for career kills behind Alex Jupiter (1,918 kills; 2008-11). Bricio needs just 22 kills to surpass Jupiter and will more than likely become USC’s all-time leader by the end of this week. In addition, she will move into 10th place in Pac-12 history if she can do that when the Oregon schools come to town starting this Wednesday.
Bricio and the No. 2-ranked Women of Troy have a 25-1 record (13-1 Pac-12) and will face off against Oregon and Oregon State back-to-back on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Both matches are set for 7:30 p.m. at the Galen Center.

With only one loss on his record, interim head coach Clay Helton is making his case for the permanent head coaching position, and it seems to get stronger every week. Helton started his campaign with a loss, but that was a well-played game against a team that the AP poll currently lists as the No. 6 team in the country.
Since that loss, Helton has gone on to upset the former No. 3 team in the country and add two additional wins against Cal and Arizona. Though the two most recent wins are less impressive than the win over Utah, Cal and Arizona are both teams that started the season off looking like legitimate Pac-12 contenders.
If Helton can double his current three-game win streak and close out the season with a win over UCLA, I think he’ll be given fair consideration for the job. He’ll be up against stiff competition, however, as many fans and donors are expecting a big name to be the next head coach.
The current situation draws comparisons to two years ago when interim head coach Ed Orgeron caused a lot of excitement and turned the team around but, ultimately, was not named head coach. The decision to go with Sarkisian over Orgeron was controversial, but I agree with Athletic Director Pat Haden’s choice not because I think Sarkisian was the best choice, but more so because Orgeron was not. Orgeron was fueled by raw emotion. He also had a talented roster of players and was able to use the unfortunate circumstances of the season to motivate his team.
Helton has a stacked roster as well and certainly isn’t lacking in emotion. He, however, has made the team his own. After the loss to Notre Dame, Helton slowed down the tempo of his game. Sarkisian ran a fast-paced offense designed to run a lot of plays, while Helton has opted to slow things down and increase the Trojans’ time of possession. So far, Helton’s strategy is undefeated.
On the field, Helton’s game plan has turned the team around, but it seems the biggest impact has been off the field. Many players have said that Helton has made the team a family and has them playing for more than themselves. Many players have also said they hope to see Helton named the next head coach.
Orgeron had the support of the team and the Trojan Family, but lacked the on-the-field success. Orgeron upset No. 4 Stanford but lost to UCLA. If Helton can close out the season with a win over UCLA, he’ll be able to do what Orgeron, and even Sarkisian, couldn’t.
Unfortunately for Helton, his predecessor’s departure caused such a controversy that Haden needs to make a splash with his next hire, and Helton might not be enough. There is a lot of speculation that Haden might step down at the end of this season, though, and Helton could potentially benefit from that.
I think Helton has certainly earned enough credit to enter the head coaching discussion, and if USC does not hire him, I think he’ll likely be offered a head coaching job at another school. I am rooting for Helton. If he gets an entire offseason to prepare, he’ll give USC a shot at a title, and if not, he’ll make a great head coach at another school.

Winter might be coming, but USC is still working to keep their recent hot-streak alive.
Quarterback Cody Kessler said that the “two-back” formation that USC has been running these past three wins, has become an identity for the USC offense and that the team has been inspired by its own ability to run the ball and maintain control of the game. This past Saturday, USC’s rushing attack accumulated 229 yards while Arizona had 60, which led USC to have more possession time.
“Coach Helton has always emphasized running the ball and play action,” Kessler said after practice Monday. “I think we’re starting to find that identity on offense. Guys are sticking to it, and this young offensive line is really starting to find itself.”
But though USC and Los Angeles got its first glimpses of fall weather this past week, the temperatures were incomparable to what USC is expected to face in their game against Colorado on Friday. It is projected to be within 30-40 degrees at kickoff in Boulder, CO.
Consequently, the team is leaving Los Angeles on Thursday to try and acclimate to the altitude and cold they’re going to have to play through. Furthermore, because of the short week, Monday’s practice, which is usually dedicated to studying film and resting, turned into a “competition Tuesday” practice, the most physically demanding and competitive of the week.
Running back coach Johnny Nansen is challenging his players to come to practice prepared for the cold and for another fight this week if they want to continue winning in the Pac-12.
“It’s a mentality thing that starts in practice. That’s why I’m challenging my guys to not wear sleeves We’re going to be tough and work to get the win,” Nansen said. “They have got to do their jobs and not let the weather be a factor. I think that the Notre Dame prepared us well for this game.”
Helton said that the  “championship-like” mentality his team practiced with Monday, after having just defeated Arizona late Saturday night, exemplifies the dedication USC has shown during its last three games, which has put them in position to possibly win the Pac-12 division.
“I just told the guys how appreciative we are as a staff for them to come out with a championship mentality like they did today and really have one of their best practices of the year. I am just thankful for them,” Helton said. “I told them that we’re having a blast as a coaching staff because these guys came out and gave the effort they did …. with a late night game two days ago — that’s really, really incredible.”
USC’s past three wins have largely been defined by the emergence of their young talent, and none have been had a greater impact than freshman Ronald Jones II, who exploded for 177 yards on 19 carries Saturday. USC coaches say that Jones is special because when he makes contact with a defender he never stops moving his feet. His “downhill” running style allows him to get into a second gear that seemed uncatchable at times against Arizona.
“It’s just a natural thing that he has got,” Nansen said. “You have to watch him play to see that he never stops his feet on contact; it is hard to bring him down. It is going to take a couple of guys because he is such an aggressive runner. If they can’t, he’ll look up field.”
USC coaches said that Jones’s relentless drive to improve on his “weaknesses” is the main reason for the incredible success he’s had in his first collegiate season. Jones already has 710 yards and could potentially scratch the 2,000-yard mark. Since spring training, he has been working with Kessler and other quarterbacks on catching quick passes.
“We all knew that he was a great runner, but I really like what he is trying to do with the things that might have been a weakness of his when he first came in — like catching the ball,” Helton said. “He is really focusing on things he wants to get better on. He made huge play catching a ball in the flat scoring that touchdown. And he has made strides in the blocking game too. I’m really proud of him.”
USC’s running game has also been fueled by the play of the Trojan offensive line and fifth year senior Kessler. Kessler’s efficient passing numbers all season has combined with Jones’s ability for a dynamic play action option on offense. Kessler says that because USC’s coaches are trying to utilize their outstanding playmakers such as Jones II, Juju  Smith-Schuster and Adoree’ Jackson, the offense is much more focused on speed and rhythmically going forward with their plays before the defense can set up.
“The offensive line loves it. I get pumped when we get a big run and those guys feel like they did all the work, which they did,” Kessler said. “It’s just a cool feeling to see Zach Banner last game come running down the field chest bumping and fist bumping everybody.”
Despite a large emphasis on the run in today’s practice, Kessler and Helton similarly talked about USC’s ability to make big plays in the passing game. Though Helton said that Juju                  Smith-Schuster didn’t practice Monday in order to protect his surgically-repaired hand, despite leading the team with 136 receiving yards against Arizona, he expects Smith-Schuster to have a productive game Friday. Smith-Schuster similarly didn’t practice last week.
“Obviously, he is a freak of nature,” Helton said. “To go out there and have the game he did, really after not catching the ball all week. But getting some catches on Friday, do and does what he does. He is pretty special.”

The world that people my age are growing up in is not fit for saying goodbye.
I’ve tossed around this idea before. It’s the over-discussed one that says technology has made life for millennials so convenient now. Social media lets us instantaneously connect or reconnect with people whom we haven’t seen in awhile. Today you’ll never have to wonder what happened to high school friends because you’ll see them getting their first jobs and posting about serious relationships via Facebook. On Snapchat, each day, you’ll watch them go out to parties and pull all-nighters.
But the caveat to this is that sometimes, unfortunately, you’ll also watch them pass away. Sometimes tragedy takes the young. You’ll watch them become memorialized on social media in the wake of an unexpected death.
I’ve seen it happen too much. This past week, my Facebook timeline broke the news of a peer’s death. She was an aspiring model killed by a stray bullet in one of those “wrong place, wrong time” scenarios on the Southside of Chicago. It’s a scenario that, as a Chicagoan, I have seen tragically played out time and time and time again.
And each time it makes me wonder, how does social media play a role in millennial grief?
During my freshman year of college, my friend Kevin also died in a “wrong place, wrong time” shooting in Chicago. This past Saturday made two-and-a-half years since that night. It’s a weird date to mark, but thanks to my Timehop app, I didn’t have to remember it all by myself.
The app sent me a push notification saying that on that day four years ago, Kevin and I had shared an extensive wall-to-wall exchange on Facebook (remember those days?). Receiving that reminder shook me. It was an unexpected reminder of loss; one that was not predicated by an anniversary or triggered by a thought. Instead it was social media, serving as a memory bank to moments I don’t think I was ready to deal with yet.
I don’t think a lot of people in our generation are ready to deal with loss for this exact reason. We were never taught how to say a final goodbye. Text messaging and Skyping and IM have cushioned the blow of final chapters. Social media prevents definite endings.
But then there’s death. It’s an ultimate ending.
For a long time, I remember trying to avoid seeing Kevin’s Facebook page. He was gone. Being on his page would just serve as a reminder that there was not a person behind the screen anymore. I’m not the only millennial who feels this way.
Other people my age have experienced this grief. And based on some statistics, we might all be closer to knowing death than we would like to think. At the end of last month, the USC Dept. of Public Safety said they saw the highest amount of suicide attempts on the campus — 12 reported ones — since the start of fall semester. Death is not just for older people, and young adults sometimes reckon with bereavement as well.
But can you ever truly lose someone when social media is there, preserving their memory?
Divorcing individuals from the technology they inhabit seems nearly impossible now. We use hashtags and Instagram photos to keep memories alive. Tech companies have also tried to help us figure out this situation. Facebook has outlined policies about memorializing accounts. If notified, the company will put “remembering” next to your name on Facebook.
Yet, for millennials, those memories are still there. Logging off does not help. Nor will a hashtag or Facebook status. Experiencing grief as a young adult in the technology age is a path no one wants to go down. We need help.
For a generation of kids who have never had to completely leave a situation behind, we won’t immediately know how to say goodbye in an age of “forever.” Yet, acknowledging that it might be difficult and an additional burden to the grieving process is necessary.
It took me a while to work up the strength to go back and check Kevin’s Facebook profile. In fact, I just went back for the first time this week, right after I saw the news about my other peer. His page now says “remembering.”
So that’s what I’m doing for now, until our generation figures out how to say goodbye. Or figures out how to make social media hurt less.
Maybe one day there will be a clear solution to this; the kinks in technology always seem to work themselves out. But for now, I think understanding how millennials grieve is a discussion that we won’t be saying “goodbye” to for awhile.
After reading “Wait An L.A. Minute” on Tuesdays, join Jordyn Holman in her millennial conversations on Twitter @JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.
Jordyn, I’m probably not the first to suggest that you wean yourself off of facebook.  If you do not, and continue to get those “remembering” hits, then “social media” problems are you.  There may be other sites out there you can do without, freeing yourself from collaborative Internet hassles that bring you little or no satisfaction.  Good luck.

Last Monday, VICE News released a list of the top 100 militarized universities in America. The rankings were determined by a dataset of 90,000 workers in the U.S. Intelligence Community since 9/11, analyzing factors such as the distribution of students’ college majors to Department of Defense research funding.
As a major source of defense and information systems engineers, as well as huge sink for military research grants, it was unsurprising that USC ranked 21st on the list. Research centers such as the Institute for Creative Technologies and the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events were cited as large recipients of Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security money. The change in funding, however, highlights a decade’s upgrade in the military landscape into the information age, but still fails to deliver improvements across international communities. Moreover, post 9/11, higher education has become increasingly militarized, but that’s not necessarily a good thing.
For instance, in a military dominated by Middle Eastern operations, fewer than 100 people from the heaviest academic pipelines into security intelligence actually have degrees in Middle Eastern Studies. Of the total, less than 1,000 actually identify as fluent in Arabic, and of those, 60 percent are national security contractors, not internal staff. For an institution that stores massive amounts of data about the Middle East and consistently espouses intervention rhetoric, it’s shameful how few actually understand Middle Eastern cultures and values.
Rather, personnel are focused in fields of information technology, computer science, criminology and business administration. Tools of asymmetrical warfare such as GIS, drones and big data analysis have demanded talent in IT and engineering but distanced military agencies even further from the social landscapes of these areas. Employees from those fields tend to come from highly specialized degree programs at schools such as the online for-profit Phoenix and American Military Universities but lack the general education necessary to approach these committees tactfully. In addition, recruitment continues to focus on engineers who develop the systems to manage this intelligence.
This skewed relationship between research universities and the military isn’t just an isolated case; military innovations have dominated academic pursuit in STEM fields as early as the 1950s, while hiring for regional studies has remained stagnant. Those with bachelor’s degrees in area studies tend to pursue careers in NGOs, journalism or translation — fields far removed from military strategic purposes. The few large-scale systems for social science performance and research have been beleaguered with internal bias and organizational failure. While research partnerships between governments and academia produce positive technical results that have huge trickle-down effects on civilian life, the pattern of militarization in our own universities belie an approach that ignores its societal effects.
This has real consequences. American troops stationed in Iraq are famous for egregious acts of misconduct that disrupt local communities and inflict trauma on the local populace. It’s not uncommon to hear accusations of institutional racism at the hands of American soldiers on counter-insurgency missions. Time and time again, political leaders are pressured into apologizing for far-too-common mistakes during symmetrical tactics like drone strikes. Counterinsurgency efforts by western troops have consistently escalated resentment from community leaders while failing to actually reform these environments.
It’s been more than 14 years since the night almost 3,000 people were killed on 9/11. Since then, defense growth has burgeoned, from the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to the creation of the U.S. Africa Command in 2007. Classified research at national universities, a once controversial and protested measure, has now become commonplace and even accepted as a symbol of academic prestige. It’s clear that military institutions have the money and the power to change the landscape of higher education, but the federal government has not come closer to truly understanding the communities at hand. Complex warehouses of international data and an army of information scientists only further highlight an international community that is just as chaotic as it was before.
At USC, it’s all too common to see disciplines in the arts and letters downplayed in favor of the applied disciplines. The huge disparities in research funding only highlight our failure to study the consequences and impacts of these applied disciplines. Developing skills for an evolving job market is an important goal in pursuing higher education, but the post-9/11 military narrative only exemplifies how the reason for our chosen work may be more important than the job itself.

If you want to hear mainstream music re-imagined, then you should look no further than acoustic covers. They allow you to appreciate the songs you already know and love. In a world of electronic instruments, acoustic covers help you get back to your music roots.  Here are some of my top five acoustic covers.
After attending his concert at the Microsoft Theater and hearing this cover live, I knew that I had to include it here. Hozier takes the original music and molds it to fit his own style by tearing the song down to its roots and building it back up again. Even though it seems vastly different from how the Beatles imagined it, Hozier’s interpretation of it is unbelievable.  

This song, which was released in 1967, has undergone many remakes, but none as unique as Jamie Cullum’s version. He changes the mood of the song dramatically through his acoustic interpretation. Cullum’s version is more laid-back and takes on a jazz motif as opposed to the 60’s pop original. He does this only with three instruments — piano, drums and stand-up bass.

While John Mayer’s acoustic re-interpretation is not too far from the original, he is still able to put his own twist on Tom Petty’s world renowned song.  Mayer only uses three acoustic guitars as opposed to the Petty rock configuration, which makes the song more intimate and less mainstream sounding. Because Mayer’s voice is completely different than Petty’s, you can almost characterize the original and cover as individual songs.

Katie Melua’s take on the Cure’s hit track provides yet another acoustic interpretation that strips a song down to its original form. The Cure’s track is heavy rock, while Melua’s interpretation is slowed down and light. Melua uses a classic acoustic guitar to get the same melody as the synth used by the Cure. These two takes are very different, but each in their own are great.

I had to include this one because of the complete contrast with the original I found in this cover.  Most of the other songs that I have talked about were covers of relatively old tracks. This cover is unique because it is a recent, well-known song that has been completely stripped down to its roots. It features two voices harmonizing and an acoustic guitar as opposed to the heavy electronic instruments of the original.

Dear Tifffany, 
I’m currently ardently in love with someone we’ll call Steven, and we’ve been together since this March. Before Steven and I were together, he was with another girl for three years. He slept with me while they were together without telling me about her existence, but I forgave him when I found out. She broke up with him shortly afterward for an unrelated incident, and we continued our relationship. She recently left a letter, and a positive pregnancy test, in my mailbox. In the letter, she noted that he’s a serial cheater and left his first girlfriend for her after they slept together. I later contacted the first girlfriend on Facebook, and she confirmed this fact, though Steven denies it, and says they’re simply out to ruin our relationship. Then his second ex-girlfriend also said that she’s eight months pregnant with Steven’s baby and has recently decided to tell him on the advice of her psychiatrist who suggested that she give him the option of adopting the baby himself if he doesn’t want the child to be put up for blind adoption. I confronted him about this, partly because I was deeply uncomfortable she found my address, and he said that he’s just ignoring her because he doesn’t believe her. Considering the positive pregnancy tests she placed in both of our mailboxes, her trustworthy and prudent reputation after talking to his friends, the emotion in the tear-spotted letter, an assent to a paternity test and the timeline, I do believe her. I can’t believe that he would simply ignore her pleas and would decline to even contact her regarding something as momentous as his first child. Is this grounds for breaking up with him, even if it technically doesn’t include me? I’m worried I’m seeing a true and ugly aspect of his character.
— Pregnant Pauses
Unfortunately, the fact that his ex-girlfriend found your mailbox is probably the least of your worries, unsettling as it is. What’s more unsettling is this sketchy, heartless bloke, Steven. These recent events have definitely made him exemplify some nasty behavior — conflict avoidance, projection, a total lack of empathy — but the red flags started well before this. 
Serial cheater or not, Steven seems to be a bit of a serial liar, or at least a repeat offender on many serious counts. Though he might have grown out of this pattern, his recent behavior doesn’t argue a good case for keeping him around. Even you say that you believe his ex, and with all the mounting evidence you’ve cited, I am inclined to believe her too. If she is making all this up, Steven’s chosen solution of ignoring the problem away still suggests a dearth of emotional maturity. Let’s not forget that this is how he is treating someone he dated for three years, and may have dated for longer had it not been for the unspecified transgression that caused her to dump him. 
Contrary to what you may think, this totally does include you. I don’t want to urge you to break up with him, but it’s definitely time to wake up and smell the roses (they smell like sh*t).

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.  
I started going on Tinder dates while studying abroad in Turkey. “Tinder tourism” we called it, and it worked out great. I joined a swim team, found my favorite coffee shop, and met some great friends. It wasn’t so bad for my ego either – Turkish men were eager, responsive, and attractive. It wasn’t until later that I found out how unbalanced Turkish Tinder was and that I was one of only about one hundred women using it in all of Istanbul.
None of these interactions ever amounted to anything more than a friendly meal and stimulating conversation. Somehow all the men I found attractive in five pictures weren’t as attractive to me in person. They were all wonderful people, interesting and sweet, but the truth was I was still wrapped up in a romance from back home. No one compared to him and no matter how entertaining my dates were, I always found myself online when I got home, exchanging messages with the infamous (if unattainable) one.
I chalked it up to wanting what I couldn’t have and resigned myself to getting all I could out of our digital romance while I could. There was always a sinking sensation that it would never work out between us, even once we were back on the same continent. But it was an easy suspicion to ignore. I Facebook-stalked my nostalgia away, and spent my bus rides to school fantasizing about when I would be back.
Even then, I was aware that I might not have been fully acknowledging the potential of my romances abroad. I never went out with anyone more than once and my mind never lingered on any one person. I wanted to spread my wings, diffuse my obsession for this far-away one with indiscriminate, almost-romances. I was the stereotypical cultural consumer, dating, wandering, living without consequence. I had a threesome, went out with someone I met on a bus. I did it for the story, for the “experience,” to forget my infatuation back home. It was easy to brave rejection from people around me when there was always someone else on my mind.
It wasn’t until I was about to leave Turkey that I realized how much I had used the people close to me. My roommate, who I had occasionally hooked up with, bashfully asked me to spoon with her our last night together. I did for a while, then got too hot and rolled to the other side of the bed. When we went our separate ways, she to Germany, me back to Istanbul, I hardly gave it a second thought. It wasn’t until my other steady fling insisted on saying an official goodbye (he wasn’t content with sneaking out of my apartment the morning before) that I realized that people had actually cared about me. People had loved me. People would miss me. And I had held myself apart from all that.
It was a difficult realization to come to, and a sleepless last fifty hours in Istanbul didn’t help. I missed my flight out of Canada and sobbed to the woman at customer service. She chased me down the hallway with a calling card after she made arrangements for my next flight, imploring me to call someone, anyone. I took it and thanked her, bleary eyed and shaky. I didn’t call anyone.
I spent that summer hiding. I was confused and ashamed and I wasn’t sure why. I knew that I had not been emotionally present during my stay, and that somehow made it feel like the past six months hadn’t ever happened. It was a blank space, an alternate reality, a sample of what life is like in sensory overload. That was all an excuse though – I was mentally checked out while I was there. I had been living a hypothetical future, not the life I was in, and that was the hardest thing to reconcile. I had wasted my time in a fantasy that would never pan out, using the people who were closest to me in the process.
The far-away one did me a favor by having a girlfriend when I returned. I should have known – he hadn’t initiated conversation in a month. The little exchange we did have was formal and halting, but I chalked it up to us both being busy. I didn’t worry about it. I didn’t worry about anything then.
I knew something had to change, something drastic, something immediate. The longer I waited to dive into my present, the longer I abused the people I loved. I sent long texts to my friends and lovers, trying to explain my new understanding, to apologize, to promise to be better in the future. This was a turning point for me and I wanted to let everyone I ignored, hurt, or been otherwise inconsiderate of, know that I was going to change my ways. I spent some time wallowing, enumerating all the ways I had been a horrible person, and purging them into sorrowful, self-deprecating texts. Then I went back to Tinder.
At first, it was just to make myself feel wanted again, to regain some sense of confidence, if a shallow one. It only took maybe one or two boring conversations for me to realize how useless this tool was when the goal was not to explore the city but to hook up in some dimly lit apartment after half-heartedly browsing Netflix. I changed my bio line to something purposely obscure and absentmindedly browsed through boy after boy while I sat on the toilet. I worked a lot and wrote a short story. I stayed in most nights and devoted my days to reestablishing my real life.
Then to my surprise, someone commented on my bio line. “Walter Benjamin’s my boi!” he wrote, “It’s rare to find a girl on here who reads.” He wanted to meet for drinks at a bar Downtown, somewhere I’d never been before, and I thought why not, it’s like Tinder tourism in my home base.
When we sat down, he asked me if I liked White Russians and I knew he was going to be a good one. We talked for four hours, I had the best White Russian of my life and we shared an awkward kiss as we parted ways. He was interesting — he worked as a chef, studied engineering, and dreamt of ways to combine the two. He had two chickens named Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. For the first time in along time, I felt romantically present.
I saw him at least twice a week before he left for school in NorCal and almost every day for the last week he was in town. He said if he had more time with me, we’d be falling in love, that I had set a new standard for people he would date in the future. I, unable to be quite as eloquent, sat in meaningful silence trying to suck tears back into my face.
We talk every day still, via text or on the phone. There hasn’t been a day since I met him that we haven’t been in contact and I have plans to go see him in a couple weeks. But I can’t help but wonder what the hell I’m doing in this situation again, living in this future fantasy of someone far away. I still struggle with the fear that I’m sinking back into the nowhere mindset I had in Istanbul, discounting the importance of my everyday interactions because I’m thinking of someone else, somewhere else.
Is this the millennial, post-modern, cosmopolitan fate? To have the capacity to carry on long-distance relationships via video chat, texting, and calls, but not the maturity? To be forever confronted with the transience of romance, never knowing where academia and jobs will take you? To be restricted to a thousand short love affairs because of the day and age? We’re all embarking on our adulthoods, or our conception of them, following jobs, schools, aspirations. Things change so fast it makes more sense to swipe right and meet for drinks with a new person every month. But there’s something so secure in knowing there’s a text waiting for you, someone specific out there longing, something a million eager Tinder matches couldn’t replicate.
Who knows. Maybe it’s easier for me at this point in my life to seek affection from someone I rarely see. I’m a senior with two jobs and a full class load. I have projects, literary, artistic, and professional to complete and a future to plan for. Realistically speaking, I know I get too invested too quickly when romance is actually available and I don’t have time for a relationship like that right now. My life functions better being alone, but yet, some part of me needs the gratification of being loved by someone, even if I can’t see them.
Maybe this is what some people get out of religion ––  the reassurance that some benevolent being has them on the brain. And maybe that’s the same as Tinder, just as diffuse but perhaps a little more tangible. There are bottomless pairings to love you, date you, woo you, maybe, somewhere, when the time is right. Someone invisible but real, someone you’ve never met but might. How can I make myself be present here when the best person for me right now is so far away? How can I make myself be present there if there may be someone better (and closer) a right-swipe away? But most importantly, how will I know when I’m present and when I’m slipping away?

If you’re like me, you’re probably out of sandwich bread or toilet paper but you’ve got bags and bags of leftover sweets from Halloween. Here are some creative ways to use up all that candy.
If you want to feel warm from the inside during this holiday season, do some charity and ship your candy to the troops. For more details, visit Operation Gratitude’s site. 
Since I’ve collected a lot of leftover peanut butter cups this year, I decided to make chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter middle. I poured the batter into the cupcake pan until each cup was a quarter full. Then, I placed the peanut buttercup in the middle and poured more batter over it. When it came out of the oven, I had delicious cupcakes with warm gooey peanut butter centers. It was ambrosial. *hearts for eyes emoji*
Make your Christmas presents more special and throw in some candy with the main gift. It’ll be sure to make your friends and family smile even bigger, especially the kids.
Leave the candy outside your door in a large box with a kind note to make someone’s day better. I know I would be very happy to see someone give out free candy in the middle of my bitterly busy day.
Okay, this may be harder than you think, but it can be very beneficial if you have good self control. Use your candy as a reward for any small goal that you achieve. Got an “A” on that quiz? Treat yourself to a mini Twix. This can be great way to motivate yourself and avoid post-Halloween binge eating. Just remember that you don’t need a reward for doing your laundry or making your bed.
