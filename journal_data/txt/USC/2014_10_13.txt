A team of USC researchers has released a study analyzing the science behind what makes a particular song a hit.
Joseph Nunes, a marketing professor at the Marshall School of Business, along with Andrea Ordanini, a marketing professor at Bocconi University in Italy, analyzed Billboard magazine’s Hot 100 list to determine what makes a song a No. 1 hit and what prevents another from ever climbing above No. 90.
“There is research on music preferences, but there really [isn’t] a lot that [is] empirical in the sense of going out and getting secondary data, or big data sets and thinking about what became popular and what didn’t based on people’s perceptions of the song,” Nunes said.
The goal of the study was to take a consumerist perspective and study what and why certain songs become popular.
Nunes enlisted a team of graduate students from the Thornton School of Music to help with the study. The team was led by Brad Sroka, a doctoral candidate studying historical musicology. Together, the research team analyzed all 1,029 songs that took the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 list between 1958 and 2012, as well as the 1,451 songs that made the list but never climbed above the No. 90 spot. Using the audio recordings of as many of those songs as possible, they coded the types of instruments and vocals audible in each hit.
Two different methods were used in analyzing the songs. The first, Qualitative Comparative Analysis, involved comparing the set of songs that reached No. 1 with the set of songs that never surpassed No. 90 to determine which combinations of instruments were most common in each set.
The second method utilized logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship between the number of different audible instrument types and the popularity of the song.
The study found that the main instrument combinations in top songs were background vocals, synthesizers and either clean guitar or distorted electric guitar.
Nunes indicated that the success of a song could partially be determined scientifically.
“I do think that like most things in life, there is a little bit of science and a little bit of art, and to be truly successful, you have to mix the two,” he said.
 
 
If you want a formula for writing hit songs, just look at the masters of song writing like Lennon and McCartney, and other songwriters from the 60’s, 70’s, etc….  You need a hook line, that is repeated throughout the song. Song cannot be too long, and it usually flows like this:  Intro, verse1, hook line, verse2, hook line, chorus, hook line, verse1, hook line, hook line….

The USC Sports Business Association hosted its annual fall panel Monday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center with Los Angeles sports industry leaders.
Break it down · Steven Esparza (left), Blaine Skinner (center) and Bobby Scales (right) joined a panel discussion Monday night. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
The panel included Blain Skinner, executive director of corporate partnerships for the Los Angeles Lakers; Mark Madsen, assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers; Jonathan Lowe, vice president of marketing for the Los Angeles Kings and Anschutz Entertainment Group; Steven Esparza, assistant director of communications for the Los Angeles Clippers; and Bobby Scales, director of player development for the Los Angeles Angels.
“We chose a team panel this year because of the lure of these teams in the Los Angeles area, they are so well respected and have such rich history,” said Jake Kelfer, president of the Sports Business Association. Kelfer was in charge of coordinating the event.
The event began with an introduction to the panel by Annenberg Professor Jeff Fellenzer and an overview of what Fellenzer calls his “Four Ps”: passion, preparation, performance and persistence.
Lowe opened the spirited discussion by emphasizing that passion is a huge part of working in the sports industry and being successful.
“There is a difference between being a fan and working in the industry. You have to love what you do on a day-to-day basis and be passionate for the teams you work for and your product,” Lowe said.
The conversation quickly shifted to social media and its impact on the sports industry, particularly on players and fans. Skinner, who has spent 34 years with the Lakers and is a USC alumnus, spoke about this impact.
“Technology has taken what we do to another level, it really changed the game in terms of fan interaction,” Skinner said.
Scales then promoted his newly created Twitter account to the crowd and admitted he was not very active on social media but that it is a huge part of the clubhouse both in the minor and major leagues and promised to get more involved.
Madsen, a two-time NBA champion with the Lakers, recently completed his M.B.A. at Stanford. He spoke about how personal relationships helped him get to where he is today.
“I got my offer from Los Angeles due in large part to relationships I created along the way when I was in the NBA. You really never know when you’re being interviewed so you must always be auditioning and prepared,” he said.
When Fellenzer questioned the panel on crisis management from a sports standpoint, Esparza was quick to respond. He touched on the Donald Sterling controversy last year. Sterling, the former owner of the Clippers, was recorded on tape making racist comments about blacks.
“TMZ called us to tell us they had audio tapes of our then-owner saying horrible things; however, they wouldn’t tell us what they had,” he said. “When the tapes were released we obviously realized the magnitude of the situation, and it was a nightmare. The sponsors began to drop, as it became local, national and then global news. The toughest part was as it affected our players; our job is to make sure our players are shielded from distractions and this was obviously a huge challenge given the situation.”
Esparza and his colleague then came up with the “We Are One” slogan that caught on quickly amongst teams and players, and even the league.
He expressed optimism about new owner Steve Ballmer and the future of the franchise.
The event closed out with each of the panelists discussing advice to students as to how to make themselves more marketable towards sports different sports teams.
“USC has always had great foresight and great vision in bringing a lot of different types of people together from various aspects of any industry, it has a strong brand that translates well into the sports industry,” Madsen said.

Former Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa met with students from the Sol Price School of Public Policy and the Environmental Student Assembly on Monday to discuss the city’s environmental policy efforts as part of the course PPD 225: Public Policy and Management, taught by Professor Nicole Esparza.
Keepin’ it green · Former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa speaks to students as part of Professor Nicole Esparza’s PPD 225 course. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
Prior to being elected, Villaraigosa served as Speaker of the California State Assembly and as a member of the Los Angeles City Council. Last year, Villaraigosa was named a professor of the practice of policy at the Price School, a title reserved for faculty appointments of individuals who have made significant contributions in the public practice of their field of expertise.
During his visit, Villaraigosa discussed his efforts as mayor to improve Los Angeles’ environmental sustainability and the challenges the city continues to face in implementing new strategies.
Villaraigosa’s interest in environmental protection was sparked by his childhood observations of the city’s poor air quality.
“Back when I was growing up, you actually couldn’t leave the classroom because of the bad air quality … you couldn’t see the mountains most of the time,” he said.
In the early 1990s, when Villaraigosa was first elected to the California State Assembly, there were debates about air quality regulations and whether they were too strict for businesses.
“Legislators like myself challenged the notion that we shouldn’t do something dramatic to fix the environment,” Villaraigosa said.
Despite facing backlash from private industry, Villaraigosa and others held their ground in the state assembly to change the city’s environmental status quo and address the concerns of constituents.
Once elected mayor, Villaraigosa said he took a hands-on role in rewriting the city’s environmental policy. He spoke about his efforts regarding four main issues: the city’s air quality, availability of public transportation, reliance on coal and port pollution. Upon Villaraigosa’s election, Los Angeles was 42 percent dependent on coal, but by retrofitting existing power plants for natural gas and transforming the Port of Los Angeles to solely electric power, environmental regulations put in place by Villaraigosa’s administration will eliminate the city’s coal dependency by 2025.
Villaraigosa said the drought was a focus of his while he was in office. To respond to California’s worsening drought conditions, the city restricted households to watering lawns twice a week and only at specific times of day. In addition, Villaraigosa said he created a program to help households replace grassy lawns with desert landscaping that better conserves water. Today, Los Angeles uses less water per capita than any other city in the United States with more than 1 million people.
“Through discussion of his experience as mayor and creating new environmental policy, Villaraigosa tied the legislative processes with the same implementation challenges that we are learning in class,” said Brandon Delijani, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development.
To address the issue of limited public transportation, Villaraigosa invested in expanding the city’s Metro lines. According to city plans, the Expo Line will reach Santa Monica by 2015. Under Villaraigosa, Los Angeles also established the only public bus system operated completely on natural gas in the United States. Students had the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with Villaraigosa and apply his insights to concepts introduced in the course.
“As a student new to the Price School, it was interesting to hear from an experienced policymaker like Villaraigosa,” said Xander Mason, a freshman majoring in policy, planning and development. “It was definitely a unique experience to hear him talk about the policies he introduced as the mayor of Los Angeles and think about how they have affected our lives for the better.”
Though Villaraigosa said his environmental policy agenda was initially perceived as too ambitious by other elected officials, he said he invested in improving the city’s sustainability anyway because he knew it was sound policymaking.
“Don’t accept the idea that public life is just about hitting singles and doubles. You can’t be afraid to swing for home runs,” Villaraigosa said. “If you want to make investments for the good of the public, you can’t let a few individuals block progress.”
Shawn Rhoads, executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly, said he was glad to hear Villaraigosa speak.
“Mayor Villaraigosa’s lecture was very energizing,” he said. “USC is an intellectual center for Los Angeles, so it is important that our campus moves forward with sustainability initiatives to keep pace with the city. We are glad that the Environmental Student Assembly could partner with the Price School to bring Villaraigosa to campus and create a dialogue among students.”

Most people do not get excited about eating oatmeal. College students regard it as an efficient albeit unpalatable weekday breakfast, made somewhat more appealing with toppings such as brown sugar and chocolate chips. I, too, shared these sentiments until discovering Megan Gordon’s cookbook, Whole Grain Mornings.
Surprising taste · The two-part method of first toasting the oats then steaming them in cinnamon-scented milk provides great flavor. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
 
The book is filled with healthy and inspiring breakfast recipes, including one for “The Very Best Oatmeal.” Despite my initial skepticism, one bite of the tender, fragrant oats, served with toasted nuts, fresh fruit and a drizzle of maple syrup, had me convinced. Gordon employs an ingenious two-part method — toasting the oats to achieve nutty flavor and delicately steaming them in cinnamon-scented milk.
After falling in love with this recipe, I began searching for creative ways to transform the old standard. Chilled oatmeal is a light and satisfying make-ahead breakfast that comes together in less than five minutes. Simply combine all of the ingredients in a portable container, allow the oatmeal to soak in the refrigerator overnight and take it with you on the way to class. As with most of the recipes in this column, you can customize chilled oatmeal using whichever fruits, nuts and sweeteners you have on hand.
My adaptation of Gordon’s baked oatmeal tastes like a dessert crumble in disguise. Layers of sliced bananas and delicately spiced oats are baked together until golden brown and caramelized, making for a hearty and comforting meal. Since the recipe requires a longer cooking time, I make a batch over the weekend and store it in the refrigerator throughout the week. Even if you are a loyal member of the oat opposition, these inventive and delicious recipes are sure to change your perspective.
 
The Best Classic Oatmeal 
Slightly adapted from Whole Grain Mornings by Megan Gordon
• 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
• 1 cup rolled oats
• 1/2 cup milk
• Generous pinch of salt
• Pinch of cinnamon (optional)
• 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water
• Maple syrup, for serving (optional)
Active: 5 min; Total: 15 min. Serves 2.
1. Melt the butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the oats and toast them, stirring occasionally, until they begin to smell fragrant and nutty, about five to seven minutes. Transfer the oats to a serving bowl.
2. In the same pot, bring the milk, salt, cinnamon and water to a slow boil over medium heat. Add the toasted oats and gently stir once or twice to incorporate them into the liquid. Cover the pot and turn off the heat. Allow the oats to sit on the burner untouched for seven minutes. After seven minutes, uncover and check the oats. If the oatmeal is too watery for your preference, allow it to sit on the burner for a few more minutes.
3. To serve, transfer the oatmeal to the reserved bowl and top with maple syrup, fresh fruit and nuts.
 
“Apple Pie” Chilled Oatmeal
• 1/2 cup rolled oats
• 1 teaspoon chia seeds
• 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
• 1/4 cup low-fat milk
• 2 tablespoons diced apple
• 2 tablespoons walnut pieces
• Pinch of cinnamon
• 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup
Total: 5 min. Serves 1.
1. Mix oats and chia seeds together in a Mason jar or airtight container. Add Greek yogurt, milk, apples, walnuts, cinnamon and vanilla and stir to combine. Place mixture in the refrigerator overnight.
2. To serve, top with more diced apple and nuts. If a looser consistency is desired, add a splash of milk.
 
Banana Baked Oatmeal
Adapted from Whole Grain Mornings by Megan Gordon
• 2 cups rolled oats
• 1/2 cup sliced almonds
• 1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
• 1 teaspoon baking powder
• 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon
• 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
• 1 teaspoon salt
• 1 1/2 cups plus 1/2 cup milk, divided
• 1/3 cup maple syrup, plus more for serving
• 1 large egg
• 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
• 3 ripe but firm bananas cut into 1/2-inch slices
• Butter for greasing
Active: 15 min; Total: 50 minutes. Serves 6-8.
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease an eight-inch square baking dish with butter.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the oats, almonds, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of the milk, maple syrup, egg and vanilla. Add to the oat mixture and fold together until just combined. Do not stir too vigorously, otherwise you will break the oats, making them mushy when baked.
3. In the prepared baking dish, spread an even layer of sliced bananas (about two full bananas), and then spoon half of the oat mixture on top. Top with the remaining banana slices and the rest of the oats. Pour the remaining 1/2 cup milk on top. The mixture will seem really wet, but the oats will soak all of the liquid up.
4. Bake until the oatmeal is bubbling and has a slightly golden top, about 35-40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm with a dollop of creamy yogurt, a drizzle of maple syrup and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt. Cover and refrigerate leftovers for up to five days.

Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumna Ngosa Chungu recently produced a documentary film, e18hteam, focusing on the inspirational story of the Zambian national football team recovering from a tragic airplane crash in 1993. The film is a Spanish-Zambian collaboration between Chungu and Spanish writer, director and co-producer Juan Rodriguez-Briso of Omnicorp Estudio. The documentary, which will also be released to commemorate the country’s 50th year of independence from British colonial rule, focuses on the “never give up” attitude of the Zambian football team, the Chipolopolo (The Copper Bullets).
Comeback story · e18hteam recounts the story of the Zambian win in the 2012 African Cup of Nations in the same country where they suffered a tragic airplane crash that killed 18 team members in 1993. – Courtesy of Purple Tembo Media
The film effectively narrates the story and history of Zambian football, the country’s pride and joy when it comes to sports. The theme of the movie revolves around how the Chipolopolo emerged victorious at the Africa Cup of Nations, co-hosted by Equatorial Guinea and Gabon in 2012. The focus of the film is on the victory of the team, which occurs in the very place where the team lost 18 of its crucial major players in a horrible plane crash, which was a huge blow to Zambian national spirit. Eighteen years and nine months later, the team emerges victorious on Gabonese soil. Another aspect of the movie focuses on a similiar loss of 18 players on the Italian team. In doing this, the film includes other voices who, beyond empathizing, share similar experiences such as the one which occurred.
Another important theme of the film is the number 18, which recurs throughout. Eighteen players were lost in the tragic crash and 18 penalties were needed to obtain their victory in 2012. This, as explained by the producer, is the reason why the film is called e18team. Another distinct feature of the movie is the enthusiastic and eclectic artists who have contributed their music, such as Pompi, one of Zambia’s most popular artists. The background score of the film was done by celebrated British composer Micheal Nyman, who wrote the score for the Oscar-nominated film The Piano. E18hteam also features the late Dennis Liwewe, Zambia’s legendary football commentator, who covered games locally and internationally for media such as BBC since the 1960s. In the movie, he talks about on how football is more than just a game and it unites nations. Some other narrators in the film include Captain Christopher Katongo, Football Association of Zambia President Kalushya Bwalya and Coach Herve Renard, who explained this seemingly predestined win.
“I grew up as an ardent football fan,” Chungu, the film’s producer, said. “We aim at preserving the Zambian history by making this film.”
She believes a “divine intervention of the 18 players who died in the crash” might have aided the team in winning the cup in 2012.
Chungu also said her father knew several of the team members who passed away on the day of the tragic incident. She vividly remembers her father crying and cannot forget the incident, a dark day in the hearts of many Zambians. Chungu plans on circulating the film around Italy in the near future to raise sponsorship since she funded the production of the film herself.
Chungu considers herself to be a proud Zambian and is happy to have been given the opportunity to make such an important film that will help preserve, “When a Zambian dies, so does a library,” she adds.
The film will premiere at Fresh View Cinemas in Lusaka, Zambia, on Friday, Oct. 16, a week before Zambia’s Golden Jubilee independence celebrations on Oct. 24. It also will be screened in Spain on Zambia’s Golden Jubilee at one of Europe’s oldest and most prestigious film festivals, Seminci (Semana Internacional de Cine — International Week of Cinema), the Laboratorio de las Artes de Valladolid and at LAVA, Sala Concha Velasco.

It was a tough weekend for the USC women’s soccer team as it found itself on the losing end of two matches, falling to No. 23 California by a score of 2-1 on Friday and to No. 3 Stanford 1-0 on Sunday.
Golden goal · Freshman midfielder Sydney Johnson recorded her first career goal during Friday’s dramatic 2-1 loss against No. 23 California. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (8-4-2, 2-3 Pac-12) were coming off a 2-0 shutout win over Utah, but their stellar performance failed to transfer over to this weekend’s games. USC fought hard and lost by only two combined goals, but the results nonetheless give the team an unappealing record in Pac-12 conference games so far.
Friday’s game against the Golden Bears (11-3, 3-2) was especially tough as the Women of Troy battled against a physical Cal team and fell victim to a controversial finish. The first half was tightly contested, with each team holding their own and neither able to finish any of the half’s nine total shots.
“I thought they started the game fantastic, that energy and pressure of the first 15 minutes was great,” USC head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “What I wasn’t happy with was that we had momentum, but we still couldn’t get many shots on frame.”
In the second half, however, freshman midfielder Sydney Johnson struck gold and slotted in her first career goal.
“It felt amazing,” Johnson said. “It was kind of unreal that it happened, and I just stood there in awe for a little bit.”
Johnson’s goal in the 64th minute of the match — which was assisted by junior midfielder Jamie Fink — gave the Trojans the lead and quickened the match’s pace. But the surge and momentum that resulted from the goal was extremely short-lived.
Without batting an eyelash, the Bears responded with an incredible shot into the upper-corner of the net out of senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley’s reach.
Cal then took up the search for a winning goal and after adding a total of eight second-half shots, they finally found the winner, but not without plenty of controversy.
A seemingly harmless cross turned into a disaster, as Stanley appeared to be cut off by one of the Cal’s Arielle Ship while attempting to corral the ball. No call was given and forward Arielle Ship took advantage of the open net, giving the Bears the advantage and the eventual win.
“We just have to be better in the final third,” McAlpine said. “We’ve gotta know how to be more composed and keep that momentum going throughout the match.”
The Women of Troy took that mindset into Sunday’s match against third-ranked Stanford (11-1-2, 3-1-1), whose resume listed impressive wins over No. 7 North Carolina and No. 5 Florida .
“Stanford is by far one of the top teams in the country,” McAlpine said. “Any time you play games like these, those are the best teachers for us.”
The Cardinal were coming off their only loss of the season after falling 2-1 to No. 1 UCLA on Thursday and were looking to get back to their winning ways.
But the Women of Troy were determined, and in response to Stanford’s stellar attack — 27 goals in 13 games — the team took a different approach. Instead of pushing forward with energy and speed from the get go, they sat back and defended, fending off Stanford attacks while trusting their defense and their goalkeeper to keep the game even.
“We had different game plans for each half,” Stanley said. “The first half was more defensively based and I thought we executed what we had planned tactically very well.”
The strategy worked briefly, but the Cardinal attacked relentlessly, and the box score showed it as they outshot USC 13-0 in the first half.
The Women of Troy’s defense held their ground until the 24th minute. Stanford broke through after Stanley’s initial save on an outside shot was not enough to keep the rebound from going in.
The Cardinal lead did little to bolster USC’s hopes of a comeback as they remained in their tactical shape and started attacking more and more. The Women of Troy had their chances, especially in the second half when they were able to push forward and get some shots on goal.
“We decided to take the last 45 minutes to press hard and use our energy towards that and try to get a goal,” Fink said. “That was pretty much the game plan.”
But it was not to be. Despite the reenergized second half attack, the squad failed to convert in their search for a draw against arguably their toughest opponent thus far.
“I thought all weekend we struggled with our final pass, and that’s the difference between having more shots and not having shots,” McAlpine said. “That is one thing we will definitely work on moving forward.”
With even tougher Pac-12 games soon arriving, the Women of Troy look to bounce back quickly to revitalize their preseason hopes of reaching the NCAA tournament.
“This is what postseason is gonna feel like,” McAlpine said. “If we remember that we still have our goals in front of us and take the positives and build on them, then it will be very easy to focus on the last six games.”

The Trojans’ win against Arizona saw USC fall victim to some more of the same symptoms that contributed to their loss to ASU: namely, a lack of depth and serious fatigue that rendered the Trojans unable to put the nail in the coffin late in games.
For all of the criticism head coach Steve Sarkisian is receiving for playing “not to lose,” this season’s team is suffering from the same depth problems as last season.
Sarkisian’s play-calling, much like his predecessor former head coach Lane Kiffin, involves running the ball often to bleed out the clock and shorten the overall game to spare the players fatigue and risk of injury. Kiffin and Sarkisian were strategically limited due to a thinned-out roster and a lack of scholarship players to take the field, and their game plans both reflect a low-risk, maximum return approach.
The only way for USC to start playing more confidently and with a more cutthroat edge is to deepen their bullpen, and the Trojans have been making strides in this regard with a recruiting class that is already filling out needs at many positions.
Despite featuring two young, talented true freshmen offensive linemen starting for the Trojans this season, USC has locked in a commitment from five-star offensive tackle Chuma Edoga. The 6-foot-3, 276 pound behemoth is currently rated as the 12th ranked recruit in the nation by 247sports.com.
Add to the mix Alabama defector and five-star pro-style quarterback Ricky Town (ranked no. 23 in the nation) and four-star defensive tackle Jacob Daniel (ranked no. 37), and the Trojans have an impressive recruiting haul already. It’s the pieces the Trojans haven’t received a full commitment from yet, though, that are most intriguing.
The first target is Long Beach Polytechnic High School product and No. 1-ranked cornerback Iman Marshall. Marshall is 6-foot-1, 190 pounds with an unofficial 4.5 second 40-yard dash. Game tape from the recruit’s junior season shows incredible coverage instincts. On one play, Marshall studies a quarterback while assigned to the flat receiver, backs off his assigned wide receiver early as the quarterback prepares his release, and times a hit on the targeted deep receiver so well that his tackle forces an incompletion.
Normally, a quarterback would see Marshall play far off his man and adjust to throw to the open man. But the game seems to move in slow motion for Marshall, and he seems so accustomed to the opposing quarterback’s movements and telegraphed passes that he knows when to gamble off his man to make the play. Marshall undoubtedly has the physical gifts to make plays at the college level — but it’s his coverage instincts that place him on a separate plane. The best news? One hundred percent of 247sports.com’s 40 critics’ predictions have the coveted cornerback going to USC.
The other exciting not-yet-committed prospect is Junipero Serra High School defensive tackle Rasheem Green. The No. 3-ranked defensive tackle in the nation will add much-needed depth to the Trojans’ defensive line. If these two top prospects are secured, the Trojans will immediately lock up one of the top-five recruiting classes in the nation.
The season is far from over, but USC’s recruiting continues to impress and sustain a strong future for the Trojans moving forward. The scholarship reductions and NCAA penalties have made their mark on the program — you only need to look so far as an ill-timed bubble screen to junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor or exhausted looking redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen crashing between the tackles in the fourth quarter.
USC has dealt with the bitterly unfair circumstances the only way they know how: by fighting on and continuing to build for a stronger future.

Though USC nearly blew another late fourth-quarter lead, the Trojans were able to escape Tucson, Arizona, and crack back into the AP Top 25 following a 28-26 upset victory over the then-No. 10 ranked Arizona Wildcats (5-1, 2-1 Pac 12).

The Trojans (4-2, 3-1) are now ranked No. 22 in the AP Poll, and sit at the top of the Pac-12 South standings after a game that seemed like it was going to be a repeat of last week’s heartbreaker against Arizona State.
Fortunately for USC, however, Arizona kicker Casey Skowron pushed a last-second field goal attempt from 36 yards out wide right, sealing the Trojan’s dramatic victory.
Instead of having to explain what went wrong in the fourth quarter, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian can take his team into Homecoming Week with some momentum as they prepare to host Colorado (2-4, 0-3) at the Coliseum on Saturday.
Even with the Trojans looking solid record-wise through six games, Sarkisian pointed out that the team is still searching for parts of its identity.
“We are still learning,” Sarkisian said. “We are still trying to figure things out.”
Overall, Sarkisian was pleased with his defense’s performance against an up-tempo Arizona attack. The Wildcats’ freshman quarterback Anu Solomon attempted a remarkable 72 passes, at least partially due to running back Terris Jones-Grigsby’s injury. The Wildcats ran 101 total plays, only five of which Sarkisian considered “explosive.”
The wear and tear of so many plays did take its toll on the Trojan’s secondary, as both junior cornerback Kevon Seymour and freshman cornerback/wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson exited the game with injuries. Redshirt freshman Chris Hawkins and true freshman Jonathan Lockett were forced to carry the majority of the load during the final quarter. Sarkisian said that Seymour and Jackson’s health problems could linger into this week. Senior fullback Soma Vainuku also missed the majority of the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury.
Another issue Sarkisian brought up was redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler’s apparent reluctance to throw the ball deep. Sarkisian said that he wanted Kessler to throw more passes down field against Arizona, though the plan did not work as well as they wanted it to.
“When we’ve called the deep ball, I’d like Cody to let it rip,” Sarkisian said.
Sark’s air-it-out strategy might have led to Kessler’s first interception of the year, which happened during the closing stages of the second quarter. The long ball did open up the running game, however, which allowed redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen to break out for 205 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries.
With the win, USC was able to knock the Wildcats down to No. 16 in the AP Poll and hand them their first loss of the season, while also leapfrogging them in the Pac-12 South Standings. Cross-town rival UCLA is now unranked in the AP Poll after falling to No. 9 Oregon 42-30 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, ending their 24-week streak in the polls.
Here at home, the Trojans will now use the week to prepare for a Colorado team that has yet to win a Pac-12 matchup this season. The Buffaloes are coming off a bye week, so Saturday’s game will be their first since Oct. 4, when they fell at home to Oregon State. USC’s tilt with the Buffs will kick off at 3:00 p.m.

This Nov. 1 will mark 29-year-old Brittany Maynard’s date with death. Diagnosed with stage four brain cancer, Maynard plans to take a pill prescribed by physicians to allow her to “die with dignity” on her own terms and avoid hospice care and the suffering to come. While her choice is a personal one, giving people like Maynard the “right” to die is not only morally unsound, but also dangerous.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
 
Maynard wrote a piece for CNN reflecting on her choice. “Now that I’ve had the prescription filled and it’s in my possession, I have experienced a tremendous sense of relief,” she wrote. “I am not suicidal. If I were, I would have consumed that medication long ago. I do not want to die. But I am dying. And I want to die on my own terms.” Maynard and her family chose to move to Oregon, one of five states in the United States that has legalized physician-assisted death.
While seemingly reasonable, Maynard’s statements resound with the reigning philosophy of our times — the choice of complete autonomy and self-determination over any deeper considerations of community. It begs a troubling question: if people are allowed to kill themselves under the pretense of dignity, then what other acts of consent could make suicide a morally acceptable possibility? The impact on society, something that Maynard left out, is disturbingly significant.
As David van Gend, a Brisbane medical doctor, told Bill Muehlenberg of blog CultureWatch, “It corrodes community, so that when [someone] gets lonely and tired of life, the community comes to him or her not with encouragement and involvement, but with a needle.” With more than 40,000 cases of suicide a year in the United States, legalizing the right to die would only exacerbate the conditions.
The immediate circle of friends and family that an individual shares his or her life with is forced to bear an even heavier load of loss. In Maynard’s case, her decision would take away any of the numbered and increasingly precious moments her family would still have with her in the event of a natural death.
In a courageous step, Kara Tippetts, a mother of four who has terminal breast cancer, recently wrote an open letter to Maynard pleading with her to reconsider. She reminds us of our duty to keep living as long as possible — if not for the sake of ourselves, for the sake of loved ones. Her plea abounds with a love for life and a unique perspective on death.
“I too am dying, Brittany,” Tippetts wrote. “But in my whispering, pleading, loving voice dear heart — will you hear my heart ask you, beg you, plead with you — not to take that pill. Yes, your dying will be hard, but it will not be without beauty.”
Relieving suffering doesn’t have to translate to actively killing the sufferer. Palliative care is an alternative out there for the terminally ill besides assisted suicide. While euthanasia gives power to doctors, lawyers and even family members to determine who should live and die, palliative care goes down a safer road for which the physician withholds or withdraws undue treatment at the request of the patient. On the other hand, cases like Maynard’s undermine trust in the medical profession, bringing into question whether doctors are here to treat rather than terminate the frail, elderly and sick.
Euthanasia is a simple solution only in a society that champions individual rights above all else — even when it means setting detrimental precedents for the world that’s left behind.
 
Valerie Yu is a junior majoring in English. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Tuesdays.
 
I’m going to disagree with you, Yu. My younger brother suffered from stage IV gastric cancer, and eventually succumbed to it. He was physically so weak and frail, the last few months of his life, that if he requested to go in this manner, I would’ve fully understood and supported him.
It’s easy to speak on behalf of those who you cannot vicariously live through. But when you watch them suffer physically, emotionally, etc. I don’t think it’s your call as to whether right-to-die is moral or immoral. It’s their call. 
This is a very interesting perspective.  I like the argument presented.  In the end, most people agree that “suicide” in any form is fundamentally selfish.  I suppose the question then becomes:  When is selfishness appropriate?  Certainly there are times when one should assert their individual liberties, but I feel that modern society has bred a culture of unprecedented selfishness where rights trump responsibilities,  Few people stop to consider one of life’s great maxims:  Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. 
I further find that modern society has cheapened and undermined the meaning and value of family, marriage, love, and even life itself.  This slow but deliberate erosion of values makes the personal decision to end one’s life.. even in this context… that much easier, or certainly more acceptable to society.  I certainly don’t envy this young woman’s position.  My heart goes out to her, and her loved ones, who stand to lose no matter what choice is made.

Last January, 29-year-old newlywed Brittany Maynard received devastating news. Her frequent and often debilitating headaches were symptomatic of a far more serious diagnosis — glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer. Further tests revealed that her condition was worse than initially anticipated and that her cancer had progressed to stage four, making her situation terminal with an expected life span of about six months.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
 
As a result, Maynard made the decision to end her own life on Nov. 1, asserting her right to “die with dignity.” Her public decision was met with expected criticism, as many charged her with choosing suicide in the face of terminal illness. Her decision, however, is far more complex than that.
“My glioblastoma is going to kill me, and that’s out of my control,” Maynard said in a YouTube video. “I’ve discussed with many experts how I would die from it, and it’s a terrible, terrible way to die. Being able to choose to go with dignity is less terrifying.”
Should Maynard decide to go through with the process, she will be take medication that, if ingested, will end her life peacefully and painlessly.
The “Die with Dignity” laws allow patients to self-administer lethal medication prescribed by a physician. After being evaluated by a physician to ensure that the decision is not made hastily or as a result of mental incompetence, the patient must then submit a written request for the prescription. Once this is complete, the prescription is filled within 48 hours.
Those who wish to view Maynard’s decision solely as that of a woman who is too afraid to deal with the impending pain and suffering her terminal illness will cause her are clearly not listening carefully enough. Maynard isn’t adopting a “fight to the death” attitude that most within our society would find more palatable and hopeful in instances like these, but she isn’t giving up on her life either, as most of her critics seem to suggest.
“The reason to consider life and what’s of value is to make sure you’re not missing out,” Maynard said in a video. “Seize the day. What’s important to you, what do you care about, what matters? Pursue that, forget the rest.”
Her insistence to seize the day and live life to the fullest are sentiments we as a society tout constantly. These don’t sound like the words of a woman who is eager to end her life. Rather, they sound like the words of a woman who is making the choice to live the rest of her life in the way she sees most fit. For Maynard, that’s spending time with those who matter most to her and doing the things she cares about in the limited time that she has. Though her decision is not necessarily the one most people would choose, it is unfair to morally judge a decision that is ultimately hers and hers alone. The decision of a terminal patient to endure until a natural death shouldn’t be afforded moral superiority over a terminal patient like Maynard who chooses to live the remainder of her life on her own terms.
Though not everyone will understand her choice, however, we can at least appreciate the fact that most people don’t receive a time limits on their lives. How Maynard chooses to live the rest of hers is a personal decision, and it is not one that makes her any less of a credible person. We can only hope that Maynard and her family will be given the peace and privacy they deserve.

Mankind is wired to end human suffering. That is most evident in the advancement of medicine. Today humans, around the world, no long suffer from such infectious diseases as smallpox. Global eradication of other such diseases as polio and malaria are underway. In short, the machine of reason is moving forward to allow an individual to also engage in ending human suffering … their own.
Though we all feel bad for her, self administered euthanasia and suicide is illegal in this  country. Next thing ya know, girls are going to kill their babies. Uhhh, oh wait….

The college football landscape is changing. This year, there is more parity within the major conferences than ever before. Just look at the Pac-12, as every team has at least one loss to a conference opponents.
USC still leads the Pac-12 South after nearly being handed its second conference loss at the hands of the Arizona Wildcats.

Although there are many factors that contribute to the balance of power across the college football world, the primary reason for this is the advent of the up-tempo, spread offense.
Many successful offensive coaches utilize the up-tempo spread offense. Chip Kelly most famously turned a consistently mediocre Oregon program into a perennial powerhouse that was just one possession away from winning a national championship.
Art Briles consistently puts up video game numbers within the Baylor offense and has turned that program around and Kevin Sumlin brought his up-tempo offense to Texas A&M, where he has averaged around 40 points per game.
Non-traditional powers such as Oregon, Baylor and Texas A&M have risen to elite status by incorporating their respective versions of the hurry-up, spread offense. The spread formation enables a team to stretch a defense laterally, and utilize the open spaces of the field. Also, the break-neck pace at which these offenses operate often tire out opposing defenses, prevent defensive coordinators from making substitutions and can allow for big plays, especially in late-game situations.
The last decade has been one of SEC dominance. These championship teams (Alabama, Auburn, LSU) have been contingent their elite defensive lineman, which for the most part, have controlled the line of scrimmage.
 An elite defensive lineman is a rare commodity in college football recruiting; more often than not, these 300 pound behemoths come from the South, California, and a few metropolitan areas. Traditionally, these elite recruits sign with powerhouse programs like Alabama, Florida, Texas, USC and a select few others. As a result, these programs have been able to dominate the line of scrimmage and the college football landscape.
The hurry-up, spread offense is designed to negate the defensive line advantage of these traditional powers. By operating at warp speed and forcing 300 pound lineman to move side to side quickly, the up-tempo spread offense wears out the traditionally dominant defensive line and creates opportunities as the game progresses.
Consider the teams that have given Alabama the most trouble the past two seasons: Auburn, Texas A&M and Oklahoma. All three programs use a version of this up-tempo spread offense and each has scored more than 40 points on the “vaunted” Alabama defense.
This season, USC has transitioned from a traditional pro-style offense to an up-tempo attack. Although sometimes this season the offense has looked stagnant and uninspiring, the foundations of a truly dynamic offense are being put in place. This current Trojans team is still going through the growing pains of switching offensive schemes and continues to search for its identity week in and week out.  As their young offensive line matures and the team’s depth improves, USC will soon have a cutting-edge offense that will be able to go point for point with anyone in the country.
