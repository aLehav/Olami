“Tradition – Honor – Success” is the new mission statement of USC’s club wrestling team, which has seen a great deal of change since its creation two semesters ago. For the first time, the team will be eligible to compete against varsity squads from other universities.

Previously, the team had only been wrestling against other universities’ club teams. USC recently joined the National College Wrestling Association and is now able to compete with opponents on the NJCAA, NCAA, NAIA and NCWA levels.
Up until early last semester, the team only had about 10 wrestlers. Peter Ferra, the president of the wrestling club and a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, says that since then, the program “has been growing at an unbelievable rate.”
Nick Cegelski, the web director for the wrestling program and a freshman majoring in public relations, says the team recruited new athletes via social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as by posting advertisements on campus. The club now features about 40 wrestlers, including a small women’s team led by Raquel Cannon, a freshman majoring in human biology.
This upcoming season is not only special because it is the first time USC wrestling will compete at the varsity level — it is also the first season the team will have an official head coach. Jack Schwartz had personal success as a wrestler in the past, winning third place in the Junior World Olympics and second place in the Pan American Games. He has also won the Senior National Olympics three times. In addition to personal success, Schwartz has an impressive coaching record: In 1981, he coached a South Hills High School team that won the California state championship. In his first season, Schwartz is looking forward to “fielding a complete team that is super competitive and creating the excitement to recruit other athletes to USC.”
In addition to Schwartz, Wesley Fulkerson, a USC alumnus, will be joining the coaching staff, while Marty Lockwood, who was an alternate for the 1976 Olympic Games, will continue to serve as an assistant coach.
Schwartz and Fulkerson’s arrivals have the athletes looking forward to the upcoming season, as their help will be necessary to compete against higher-level teams.
“I am very excited to work with our new coaches,” Cannon said. “I see great potential in our rising team and can only see the coaches as an extension of that potential. We are all very happy to have their help.”
The team hopes the new coaches will help build upon the success of last year. In a tournament on Dec. 1 at UCLA, USC’s somewhat young team fared well, recording 10 wins and nine losses against wrestlers from UC Irvine, UC Riverside, UCLA and Ventura College.
This season, the team will travel to Santa Barbara for a dual meet with UC Santa Barbara on Jan. 26, and will later compete in the California Collegiate Open, hosted by San Francisco State University, on Feb. 2.
“We have fairly high expectations for this season,” Cegelski says. “Even though we are a new team, we have a few guys who wrestled at community college before coming to USC, guys who competed in the high school nationals and a few state placers.”
The wrestling team welcomes new members and no experience is required.   The expansion of the wrestling program is simply good news for Cannon, who says wrestling is a sport that more people should watch and more schools should adopt.
“There’s just something about wrestling; the blood, the sweat, the tears, the training, the accomplishments and the falls … it’s just something that the world needs to experience.”
Take down, escape, nearfall and pin!
Not an Ohio State, OSU, Penn State or Iowa…but a start.
Hopefully the athletic department gets wind of this and starts funding them. I’ve said for years that USC needs wrestling!
It’s more popular in the Midwest and Northeast schools, unfortunately.
Wow, this is awesome! great job guys starting this up
Congrats!  Love to see the sport continue to grow.

Beginning the season ranked No. 4 in the country, the USC women’s tennis team will look to build off the success of last year’s Final Four run and make a push for an elusive NCAA championship.

For the second straight season, USC will open up their season against UC Irvine, who it defeated handily in last year’s opener.
Despite being led by senior and All-Big West first-teamer Kristina Smith, the Anteaters will be hard-pressed to avoid their second straight defeat at the start of the year to the Women of Troy.
The USC women’s tennis team comes into this year with their core still intact after losing only senior Alison Ramos to graduation. Though Ramos’ departure will surely be felt in the locker room, as her senior leadership was a driving force last season, USC still trots out a trio of top-20 ranked players in sophomores Sabrina Santamaria and Zoë Scandalis (ranked No. 17 and No. 19, respectively) as well as de facto leader and senior Danielle Lao, who sits at 14th nationally.
“This year we’ve got a great group of girls. High talent and high character all around,” USC coach Richard Gallien said.
On top of their strong singles play, the true strength for the Women of Troy lies in their doubles squads, where they boast the nation’s top team in Santamaria and junior Kaitlyn Christian. Along with that duo, Gallien’s squad also has the combination of Scandalis and Gabrielle DeSimone, who rank at No. 13 in the doubles rankings. Lao, meanwhile, is paired with fellow senior Valeria Pulido to make up the No. 40 team in the country.
Looking to supplement last season’s 24-4 record will be incoming freshman Ellie Yates and sophomore Giuliana Olmos, who hope to add to the firepower for the Women of Troy.
Yates, who was signed last November, was a top-notch athlete in high school, setting school records in swimming and track,while proving her acumen in tennis as a top-10 player. Though playing time might be hard to come by on a deep USC team, she could see her court time increase, as Gallien has never been shy to play a younger option if the talent is evident.
One player who could fight for time early on is Olmos, who sat out last season because of an NCAA technicality. She’s poised to make her mark for the Women of Troy, and Gallien said that “no one at USC is hungrier to compete than Giuliana Olmos.”
After their match against UC Irvine, the Women of Troy will split up and head to Las Vegas and Palm Springs for the Freeman Memorial in Nevada and the National Collegiate Tennis Classic at home in California.
Getting off to a fast start was a boon for last season’s squad and the players on this year’s roster are hoping for some similar success.
“We’re going to win some big matches and we’re going to lose some matches. But we just want our girls and everyone within this program to have fun,” Gallien said.

On Monday morning, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden dismissed USC coach Kevin O’Neill after more than three seasons on the job. O’Neill was 48-65 during his time at USC, despite the fact that the team was coming off a 76-59 road victory over the Utah Utes and seemed to be gaining some momentum.
Tough Decisions · USC athletic director Pat Haden will need to choose between a head coach with experience in the NBA and a head coach who has made a name for himself in the college ranks. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Haden said in a press release that “despite a nice road win in our last game, I felt it was best to make a change now, with most of the Pac-12 season still ahead of us, in order to re-energize our team.” Whatever the reason, assistant Bob Cantu has been handed the reins and will have a chance to finish out the season.
Now the question is: Who’s the long-term solution at the head coach position?
First, the most immediate (albeit unlikely) option: Cantu himself. The 38-year-old has been a steady source of dependability during some rocky times in USC basketball history, serving on the coaching staffs for Henry Bibby, Jim Saia, Tim Floyd and O’Neill. He knows the ins and outs of the program and has seen the team make NCAA tournament appearances and flounder to six wins for an entire season. That’s an important qualifier for the position as the interim coach tries to keep a ragtag roster intact for the remainder of the year. And don’t discount his recruiting, which has played an instrumental part in getting a few NBA-level talents to choose the Trojans over the well-esteemed basketball program across town.
Cantu hasn’t counted himself out yet — in a press release Monday he told reporters, “As an assistant, your goal was always to become a head coach. It’s always been my goal, [but] you never envision it happening this way, that’s for sure.”
Realistically though, it’s unlikely he’ll be able to keep the job. It’s not for a lack of ability or experience, as Cantu has certainly paid his dues to put himself in position for an upgraded role.
What it ultimately comes down to is heightened expectations, and barring a Cinderella run to the NCAA Tournament, USC fans are going to want an established, big name running the struggling basketball program. Cantu will likely get a legitimate shot at a head coaching job sooner than later, but it’s doubtful that opportunity will come with the Trojans.
So that leaves two other options: a current/former college coach, or a current/former NBA coach. Haden would be wise to stick to a college option, especially after the indiscretions of Tim Floyd and the lack of victories produced by O’Neill. Both had experience in the pros and couldn’t get the Trojans over the hump for a sustained period of time (technically, Floyd got USC to three straight NCAA tournament appearances, but those years are now looked down upon).
Former Sacramento Kings coach Reggie Theus has expressed interest in the position, according to Yahoo!’s Marc Spears, but Theus doesn’t have sustained success at any level other than one strong year at New Mexico State. The Trojans would be better served looking for a candidate with a consistent track record.
Former Virginia Tech coach Seth Greenberg is also rumored to be interested, but his resume features long periods of mediocrity during his previous stints.
The most logical choice would be University of Pittsburgh  coach Jamie Dixon. He’s from North Hollywood, Calif., and maintained the momentum Ben Howland created with the Panthers in the early 2000s into a full-on powerhouse. He reached the 200-win mark faster than any other coach in NCAA history (sharing the record with Mark Few and Roy Williams) and has done so without any superstars on the roster — the highest-drafted player under his tenure was Sam Young with the 36th pick in the NBA draft. That would bode well for the Trojans who, for every O.J. Mayo and Nick Young, have had dry spells without NBA-level talent on the roster.
Dixon also gave a classic, non-committal answer when asked about his interest in the USC job.  “I don’t talk about it or think about it,” Dixon said.  “We’re just going about our business getting ready for Villanova.”
It might be a long shot, but it’s a long shot worth pursuing. The Trojans have settled for guys with NBA backgrounds who haven’t proven they have what it takes to build up a contender in the college ranks. Dixon would bring some real legitimacy to the program and satisfy basketball-hungry fans looking to root for a winner once again.
 
I agree on Dixon, but please do some research WRT Floyd – he was cleared of any wrongdoing by the NCAA, which is why he is still coaching basketball at UTEP.

The California Legislative Black Caucus expressed strong opposition to giving USC control of the Coliseum’s parking lot, part of a deal that would allow USC to control the Coliseum and surrounding areas.
Turf wars · The most recent proposed lease agreement for control of the Coliseum could result in continued access to parking lots for football fans, but no additional parks for the surrounding community. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The caucus wrote in a letter last week that the parking lots near the arena should be converted into parks for the South Los Angeles neighborhood.
The proposed agreement between the state of California, which owns the Coliseum, and USC would allow the university to lease the Coliseum, the Sports Arena and parking lots one through six in Exposition Park. The Coliseum Commission currently manages the stadium complex for the state.
As determined in meetings last year, the proposed agreements would allow USC to enter into consecutive 20-year leases for the next century. It would also give USC the option to demolish the Sports Arena and build a professional soccer stadium in its place.
Vice President of Real Estate Development and Asset Management Kristina Raspe said the university is considering this new lease of the facilities because the Coliseum Commission is in breach of the lease it entered into with USC in 2008 after the commission failed to make needed repairs and improvements to the Coliseum.
“We believe that the Coliseum is a local and national treasure that should be improved and preserved for many generations to come, and the Coliseum Commission does not have the financial ability to preserve it any longer,” Raspe said. “USC is willing to invest its capital to improve and maintain the Coliseum so long as it is given the ability to manage, operate and preserve the venue on a daily basis, again at USC’s expense.”
Raspe believes USC will only have this ability to operate if the venue is surrounded by ample parking space.
Though critics say that the proposal would allow USC too much power over the taxpayer-owned parking lots, USC officials argue that this space is crucial to the preservation of the Coliseum.
“Available and affordable parking is essential to the financial viability of both the Coliseum and the Sports Arena,” Raspe said. “If USC is to invest a minimum of $70 million into the Coliseum, it must be assured that the venue is given every ability to compete with other local venues.”
Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a caucus member whose district includes the Coliseum, thinks differently. The former Los Angeles City Hall real estate expert said that the deal violates a promise made by the state to eventually transform the lots into parks for the South Los Angeles community.
“When the entire Legislative Black Caucus looks at the parking lots, we see green space,” Jones-Sawyer told the Los Angeles Times. “We see families. We see picnics. We see soccer fields.”
The CLBC could not be reached for comment.
Some students think USC should be more actively involved in running the facility, which hosts the football team’s home games.
“The Coliseum is a huge part of what defines USC, our football program and our incredible school spirit,” said Mandy Raeder, a sophomore majoring in accounting. “The stadium is a historic part of USC culture, and we should be in charge of maintaining it in order to preserve those traditions. I think the parking lots are crucial to that, because it allows for more fans and alumni to come see the games.”
The parking lot proposal was developed by USC and Anna Caballero, a member of Gov. Jerry Brown’s cabinet. The deal stipulates that USC would pay the state rent for the Coliseum and parking lots and also provide tens of millions of dollars in funding for improvements to the facility.
The California Science Center board, which has the final authority on what will happen in Exposition Park, must approve any agreement before finalizations are made.
There are 2 choices here – give USC what they want or demolish the Coliseum.  Parks are great but they don’t help pay the bills.  USC is the only entity ready, willing and able to revitalize the stadium but they aren’t going to do it with one hand tied behind their backs.

Kevin O’Neill is out as USC’s men’s basketball coach. His long-term replacement has yet to be determined but, for now, Bob Cantu will take over as interim head coach.
Fresh start · Interim head coach Bob Cantu will lead the USC men’s basketball team for the final 14 games of the regular season, as well as the Pac-12 tournament, beginning March 13 in Las Vegas. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
Cantu has resided as an assistant at Troy for 12 years, and now the power to lead the basketball program is in his hands. With the team’s record standing at 7-10, Cantu has changes planned for the squad and spoke Monday afternoon about what might be different for the rest of the season.
The first order of business for Cantu will be speeding up the Trojans’ offensive pace, or lack thereof. The Trojans are 11th in the Pac-12 in scoring at 63.8 points per game, and also 11th in field goal percentage with 42.5 percent.
“I want to play a little faster and I want to press a little bit,” he said. “[I want to] try to create easy baskets. I think a lot of times you sit and try to grind out in a half court and it’s difficult to score. We’re going to make adjustments to one of our basic offenses and get the ball rolling.”
Cantu also mentioned the possibility of divvying up playing time, including giving minutes to players that found themselves in O’Neill’s doghouse. He specifically mentioned a pair of transfer forwards, junior Ari Stewart and senior Renaldo Woolridge. Expected to be an athletic, slashing forward with 3-point ability, Stewart is averaging nine minutes per game and hasn’t played in eight of the Trojans’ 17 contests; Woolridge, meanwhile, is getting just 4.1 minutes a game.
“Guys that are here have shown that they have been successful at other places,” Cantu said. “Renaldo, Ace [Stewart], [and] other guys that haven’t played as much need to come out and have a great practice [on Tuesday and Wednesday].”
Senior point guard Jio Fontan is the program’s most tenured player, and was generally given the reigns of the offense by O’Neill, something that Cantu plans to continue.
“I talked to Jio about becoming an extension of me on the court, and being an associate head coach on the court,” he said.
Fontan has struggled to find his shot and take uncontested looks, shooting 32 percent from the floor, but is third in assists in the Pac-12 with 5.2 per game. The Trojans’ floor leader hasn’t paid the notion of switching coaches midseason much thought yet.
“For the most part, I don’t really think you have much time to think how hard it is,” Fontan said.
It will be an uphill battle for the Trojans to find success, but Cantu has confidence in his inherited squad as it moves forward in the Pac-12.
“You just look at the league… and I just see us having our chances in every game,” Cantu said. “We have great kids and they love the game of basketball, and I think they’re going to think about some of the things we discussed today and they’re going to come out focused.”
Though the Trojans’ interim leader did express that his goal is to become a permanent head coach, Cantu deflected attention away from any potential consideration for the vacant USC position.
“I want to do the best job I can, but my main focus is not on me,” Cantu said. “It’s on the players.”

USC Information Technology Services reported that the hardware problems that caused frequent USC Wireless outages during December have been fully resolved.
Caught in the Web · Catherine Price, a senior majoring in business administration and political science, uses USC Wireless to access the Web. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
ITS added new hardware that can better manage and support large influxes of data. The department also reconfigured the networks to improve performance.
“The USC Wireless network is growing on a daily basis,” said Russ Kaurloto, ITS associate chief information officer. “Many students, faculty and staff come to campus with multiple wireless devices. ITS is always evaluating improvements to the network to improve access and performance.”
USC experienced numerous outages across its USC Wireless and USC Wireless Plus networks during the week before finals last semester, causing widespread frustration among students. While technicians at that time identified that the problem was with the hardware, they experienced difficulty pinpointing the root of the problem.
Since December, technicians have worked to identify and resolve the outage problem.
“The cause of the problem was an inordinate amount of network connections and traffic, including video streaming, which saturated the network,” Kaurloto said.
USC ITS recorded more than 27,750 devices attempting to connect to USC Wireless simultaneously on Dec. 5 alone.
Initially, the performance issues facing USC Wireless were intermittent and limited to short intervals, allowing the network to recover from high demand. However, without a continuous outage, it was more difficult for technicians to identify the precise cause of the issue.
First, technicians had to identify the types of traffic creating an excessive load on the network. Then, once the channels were identified, technicians were then required to evaluate the available technical options to ensure that they would effectively resolve the problem.
To ensure these issues do not resurface this semester, Kaurloto explained that USC ITS has incorporated several preventive measures into the network, including limiting the types of traffic allowed on the wireless networks.
“ITS is constantly evaluating network performance and adding new monitoring and networking tools,” Kaurloto said.
The wireless issues last semester were disruptive both in and outside of the classroom.
“Everything in the classroom has become more digital. Many of my professors send out study guides, assignments and notes online,” said Sabrina Fung, a graduate student majoring in urban planning. “Without the Internet, it was difficult to access and download files from Blackboard when I came to study on campus.”
Because of the high demand for an Internet connection, students also found it difficult to access alternate Internet resources on campus, particularly at the libraries.
Katherine Wu, a junior  majoring in biomedical engineering, who also works at Leavey Library, said that Internet outages led to the unfamiliar problem of overcrowding in the library.
“There were long lines for computers and it was really hot,” Wu said.
For some students, however, the lack of Internet led to an increase in productivity.
“Since I could not access the Internet, I spent time getting work done that did not require the Internet,” said Melinda Grodsky, a graduate student majoring in public administration. “I actually found this to be productive. It allowed me to focus on readings and assignments without distraction from the Internet.”
Despite the frustration the outages caused last month, students did not express concern or worry that the USC Wireless issues would present additional problems for them this semester.
“I’m not concerned about future problems with USC Wireless,” Grodsky said. “I think USC is on top of it.”

Established by The Friends of the USC Libraries in 1988, the USC Libraries Scripter Award recognizes the screenwriters behind the year’s strongest cinematic adaptations, in addition to the author of the written work upon which the screenplay is based.
The finalists for this year’s 25th annual ceremony are the authors and screenwriters of Argo, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Life of Pi, Lincoln, The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Silver Linings Playbook.
Only five adaptations are traditionally chosen as finalists, but this year a tie caused six to be chosen from a field of 82 candidates. Notable Scripter winners of the past include The Descendants, The Social Network and Schindler’s List. The inaugural awards in 1988 honored author Helene Hanff and screenwriter Hugh Whitemore for 84 Charing Cross Road.
USC Libraries will name the winning authors and screenwriters during a black-tie ceremony on Feb. 9 at Doheny Memorial Library, and the selection committee will feature award-winning screenwriters, authors and faculty.
Golden Globe-winning screenwriter Naomi Foner and Howard Rodman, USC professor and vice president of the Writers Guild of America West, will co-chair the event, with Academy Award winners Helen Mirren and Taylor Hackford serving as honorary dinner chairs.

Hallelujah! 2012 has come to a close, and the world didn’t end. However, some beleaguered souls  may have packed on a few extra pounds from anticipatory stress eating, and some ambitious ones might have made New Year’s resolutions to finally get fit. With the right soundtrack, those distant goals just might come to fruition.
It can be difficult to see through an overly regimented resolution; in fact, some journalists have even written that resolving to do more than one usually does — as opposed to seeking a real change in behavior or outlook — can, ironically, stifle one’s work ethic. In any case, exercise is best in moderation. Some might even say that minimal exercise is preferred. Minimal exercise that does not interfere with eating or watching TV, perhaps.
But if you are that fantastic person who loves to work out and loves to follow through on resolutions, then congratulations, you’re in the right place! And if you are that sympathetic person who always dreamed of loving exercise, but the relationship just didn’t work out (so to speak), then you too have arrived at your destiny.
Because great art can get us through the hardest of times, an exceptional gym playlist is vital to any exercise operation. The following ten songs could motivate the most sedentary Trojan to get off the couch and to keep on moving all year round:
1. “Power” – Kanye West (2010)
You are a superhero. You have all that power no one (wo)man should have. After all, New Year’s resolutions are about egotism as much as they are about self-improvement. So start with a big boost, even if this level of fantasizing at the gym seems downright ridiculous.
2. “19-2000 (Soulchild Remix)” – Gorillaz (2001)
You’re finding your stride. You’re dancing. You love exercise. According to Gorrillaz frontman Damon Albarn, those Nikes you’re wearing are tethering you to the ever-spinning earth! The familiar drum track, apparently lifted from Sly & the Family Stone’s “Sing A Simple Song,” is whimsical and bouncy and could get any elliptical session off to a smooth start.
3. “Get Back” – Ludacris (2005)
This song should not need too much explanation. Besides being a completely absorbing tune, the music video features Ludacris wearing huge fake arm muscles. You might never look quite like that — nor should you want to — but you might get so motivated you’ll never relinquish those weights.
4. “Valerie” – Mark Ronson ft. Amy Winehouse (2007)
Amy Winehouse might have been a melancholic figure, but this is one of the most fun songs out there. If “dance party” counts as an exercise routine, then the soundtrack should always have “Valerie” on a loop.
5. “Lonely Boy” – The Black Keys (2011)
The reason for this is simple: Everyone should dance like the guy in the music video, directed by Jesse Dylan.
6. “Take A Walk” – Passion Pit (2012)
Sometimes people just like to walk. This is a song that will let you go outside and enjoy the scenery. A nice stroll definitely still counts as exercise.
7. “Police On My Back” – The Clash (1980)
Say you’re getting a bit out of breath, slowing down into a rut or getting languid instead of serious — everyone has a mid-workout slump. Totally understandable. Do you know what might help? A really stressful punk song. The scenario: You’re a criminal on the loose and the fuzz is catching up. So run like your life depends on it. (If this works for you, the Sex Pistols are also loud motivators.)
8. “Countdown” – Beyoncé (2011)
If the prospect of incarceration didn’t put a fire under your behind, then maybe the prospect of grinding it up on your (wo)man will get you moving. Show everyone at the gym that you’re the fly-est. But looking great doesn’t just happen. It takes serious work to look like Beyoncé. You have a few good decades to go, so you’d better start in 3…2…1…!
9.“Settle Down” – No Doubt (2012) 
Looking like Beyoncé may be a few light-years away, so focus your workout on a specific area. Maybe Gwen Stefani’s intimidating mother-of-two abs will motivate you to do some sit-ups. They will. You can be “hella positive for real” about that.
10. “Dancing On My Own” – Robyn (2010)
This song might be so last year, but it’s a timeless gym staple. It can be a pump-up song or a time for reflection; it has a great beat for crunches, good tension for stretching and emotional depth to carry you on your gym-rat journey. Keep dancing, readers. But don’t dance like Robyn in the Lyon Center.
Honorable mentions include: “Come on Eileen” by Dexy’s Midnight Runners, for the break down at two minutes, 55 seconds; “Battle Scars” by Guy Sebastian and Lupe Fiasco, for its intense twists and turn; and “Close To Me” by The Cure, because Robert Smith is also out of breath and you probably have less weight to lose than he does.
With a fun, motivating playlist, pretty much anything is possible. Anyone serious about getting to the gym should make sure to have all the tools for success at the ready: good arch supports, plenty of fluids and of course, a solid soundtrack.
go sara wooo!

When A$AP Rocky stumbled onto the rap scene in 2011 with his debut mixtape Live.Love.A$AP, much of the hip-hop community didn’t know what to make of him. Rakim “Rocky” Mayers is a gangly, French-braided Harlem 20-something named after East Coast hip-hop legend Rakim. The shared name of Rakim is the extent of the similarities between the two. Despite Rocky’s East Coast roots, his sound on his debut is heavily influenced by, and borrowed heavily from, Houston’s chopped-and-screwed, bass-heavy production, which saw its apex with the likes of artists like DJ Screw, Lil’ Keke and U.G.K.
Live.Love is a master class in downtempo hip-hop production, and though its sound might have divided devoted hip-hop listeners and purist critics, the appeal was undeniable: Rocky parlayed the mixtape’s success into a  $3-million deal with Sony, and his promotional tour sold out across the country. Rocky’s spiritual follow-up to Live.Love.A$AP is in fact Rocky’s major label debut album, the highly anticipated new Long.Live.A$AP which was released on Tuesday.
The album opens with the title track — a clap of thunder, grinding bassline and plinking synths sprinkled in the background. Rocky opens with the words “I thought I’d probably die in prison, expensive taste in women / Ain’t had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes.” The two lines represent much of Rocky’s lyrical content — well-worn rap clichés like the classic “rags-to-riches” story narrated with a reedy delivery that doubles as its own rhythmic instrument. Rocky is no stranger to internal rhymes and complex assonance, and he knowingly stresses the right vowels in the interest of musicality better than any emcee since Eminem.
With this holistic approach to music comes compromise in the form of actual content: there’s very little substantive lyricism to be had here. Rocky’s lyrical themes rarely stray from his rough upbringing, his success, his gold teeth, his peerless swagger, his enjoyment of alternative medication and the fact that women are rather fond of him. Despite this, no rapper can match the musical and poetic flourish with which Rocky delivers what would otherwise be outright hip-hop banality.
Long.Live.A$AP’s success relies primarily on the syrupy, atmospheric production of relative newcomers in Clams Casino and A$AP Ty Beats as much as it does on Rocky’s charisma and technical gifts as an emcee. Long.Live.A$AP builds on the two primary strengths of Rocky’s first effort but also provides more uptempo production and experimentation in collaborations, including a surprising co-production with dubstep artist Skrillex.
Clams Casino returns for two contributions to the album including “LVL,” a more polished production in line with his previous contribution on Live.Love, with gritty, stuttering synthesizers grinding over a booming bassline. An ethereal voice chanting “ASAP Rocky” only adds to the overall celestial feel of the track.
“1 Train,” produced by Hit-Boy, places a string loop over traditional boom-bap drums, an effective canvas for the litany of featured rappers that reads like a “who’s who” in underground hip-hop including Big K.R.I.T., Danny Brown, Kendrick Lamar, Action Bronson and Yelawolf. Danny Brown’s verse stands out in particular, a heinously raunchy affair with a couple gut-busting punch lines unfit to print.
“Wild for the Night,” the much-ballyhooed collaboration with Skrillex, opens with Rocky rapping in his chopped-and-screwed voice over a simple drum pattern. After the first sixteen bars, the doors on the track fly off; pairing Rocky’s irresponsible lyrics with Skrillex’s screaming synthesizers generates an infectious energy, and it becomes clear Rocky has a club banger on his hands.
For all of its strong points, the album falters when Rocky is forced to step out of his comfort zone and slog away in
label-compulsory exercises. Rocky sounds noticeably uncomfortable name-checking expensive labels in “Fashion Killa,” a shameless attempt to pander to the female demographic. The only thing more painful than the awkward hook on “Fashion Killa” is probably the boardroom arm-twisting accountable for the track’s inclusion.
“PMW (All I Really Need)” finds Rocky’s tour mate and Black Hippy member ScHoolboy Q collaborating once again, except this iteration fails to deliver on the frenetic energy of previous joint-effort “Hands on the Wheel” or the raw machismo of “Brand New Guy.”
The album draws to a close with the Rocky-produced “Suddenly,” which sports a minimalist production that sees Rocky at his most candid over a muffled vocal sample fading in and out of earshot. Rocky focuses more on lyrical content here, as he narrates vignettes of his childhood and expresses genuine surprise at his meteoric rise to fame. The track is a fitting close to a startlingly well-conceived debut. After all, only fifteen months have passed since the release of Live.Love.A$AP when Rocky was a relative unknown. With Long.Live.A$AP, Rocky has launched himself to the forefront of hip hop along with Kendrick Lamar as potential ambassadors for the genre to future generations. Perhaps for Rocky, it’s one more thing he could share in common with the elder Rakim.

Amid the seriousness of skyscrapers and corporate buildings in Downtown Los Angeles, a new center has emerged, bursting with color and promising a variety of culinary delights. Simply called Fig at 7th, this semi-circular complex serves a wide range of tastes, offering the flavors of India, Greece, Mexico, Korea and, for the less gastronomically adventurous, good old American favorites. The restaurants are clustered together as small, quick-service venues accompanied by a clean, spacious eating area that spans both indoor and out.
Fresh on Figueroa · The $40 million upgrade of Fig and 7th has brought a City Target, a gym and several culinary dining experiences. – Elana Valeriote | Daily Trojan
Not far off, another American-style eatery, Juicy Lucy, offers the classic burger, fries and shake combo. A fresh take on this traditional meal might include the namesake burger (which has cheese stuffed inside the beef), a salted-caramel shake and the Sriracha cheese fries.
Those who try to eat consciously and sustainably will be at ease munching at Mendocino Farms. Inspired by the Northern California county that has shown great support for the Slow Food movement, this restaurant “promotes eating seasonally and locally,” as explained on their website. The menu offers numerous healthy options, including robust salads and vegan dishes, alongside a long list of sandwiches inspired by seasonal produce, including “Chef Judy’s Special Sandwich Pick,” assembled from “the best the Farmer’s Market has to offer.”
Indus by Saffron brings the taste of India to the West Coast in an array of colorful, aromatic dishes cooked by renowned Chef Bhupender Singh. Singh developed his cooking skills in his home country at a restaurant “regularly named the best Indian restaurant in the world.”
Through open glass doors, passerbys walking by the Downtown L.A. location are able to watch as the chief reproduces the authentic flavors of India in the clay ovens, called tandoors.
A craving for Asian food may be satisfied at Oleego by Park’s Barbeque, which serves a traditional Korean menu, including dishes such as prime beef tongue and seasoned special pork belly, which might not appeal to less intrepid eaters. As explained on the Fig at 7th website, Oleego falls under the “fast-casual … category that combines high-quality and healthy food, with quick services and a comfortable dining environment at accessible prices.”
Joe Kim, owner and chef of The Flying Pig Café, uses his traditional culinary background with his travels over the world to create an international menu. The effect of these different cultural tastes is evident in the menu, which ranges from escargot to duck-fried rice to grilled Santa Barbara calamari.
Even more exotic tastes can be found at George’s Greek Grill, which serves traditional Greek dishes including gyro, keftethes, falafel and spanakopita. For those who prefer dishes they can pronounce, soups, salads, burgers and sandwiches are also available.
Loteria Grill, which has been successful in a number of locations including Hollywood, Santa Monica and the Farmers Market, boasts “the very best regional Mexican cuisine, handmade tortillas, [and] refreshing aguas frescas.” Chef Jimmy Shaw of Loteria Grill has been featured on the Today show, in the magazine Bon Appétit and the “L.A.’s Original Farmer’s Market Cookbook.”
Perhaps the most exciting of all the additions to the Fig at 7th complex, Sprinkles Cupcakes has appeared in its usual shades of pink and chocolate brown. Declared by the Los Angeles Times as “the progenitor of the haute cupcake craze,” Sprinkles — having perfected the soft cake texture and delicately sweet, smooth frosting from the start — remains a favorite even amid an ever-growing number of competitors. You can’t go wrong with a classic red-velvet cupcake, but (speaking from experience) the triple-cinnamon cupcake deserves high praise as well. With gluten-free and vegan options, everyone can enjoy the cheerful environment and impending sugar rush promised by Sprinkles Cupcakes.

Though the Mayan calendar miscalculated the end of the world in 2012, new information published by the National Climactic Data Center forebodes an equally concerning future for the planet.
The report, released last week, named 2012 the warmest year on record for the continental United States — a record previously set in 1998. And though the year’s average temperature — a chilly 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit — might seem undesirably low for USC’s student body, it marks the 15th straight year of temperature increases for the country and furthers evidence backing claims of climate change.
Data collected by the federal government since 1895 demonstrates a continual increase in U.S. temperatures. Not coincidentally, rates of fossil-fuel consumption
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
and greenhouse-gas emissions have been on a steady incline for decades. Current Environmental Protection Agency inventories have U.S. emissions projections on an upward trend through 2050, assuming no reforms are made. Additionally, global scientific consensus — as collected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — backs the notion that it is in fact these harmful, man-made activities that are causing the increases in temperature.
The data is alarming, and the consequences could be catastrophic. Climbing temperatures at home and abroad will result in the loss of land to rising sea levels, the spread of tropical diseases, worldwide food shortages and, of course, an increase in the occurrence of extreme weather, the likes of which were most recently seen with Superstorm Sandy.
The social, ecological and economic costs will be tremendous. Forget the iconic polar bear — if action isn’t taken, the planet will soon be unlivable for ourselves.
And action must be taken now. Unlike many current political issues, that of man-made climate change comes with a time limit. If new proposals for reform continue to be met with the type of gridlock that has plagued Washington for years, the problem will soon be insurmountable. For too long, policymakers and voters alike have placed short-term interests ahead of our long-term responsibility to protect our way of life for future generations.
This dangerous trajectory will inevitably bring about our own destruction if immediate adjustments are not made.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the necessary reforms will be initiated from the top-down. Even as President Barack Obama emphasizes an “obligation to future generations to do something about [climate change],” it appears that the problem will once again take a secondary role on the national agenda to issues such as jobs and the economy. What’s more, Big Oil has already reared its ugly head in the new year, with Jack Gerard, the chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, warning Congress and the White House against any actions that might impede domestic fossil-fuel production.
So, with precarious support from the government and intimidating opposition from the increasingly powerful oil companies, everyday citizens are left with the task of addressing climate change themselves. It’s a daunting endeavor, to say the least, but grassroots initiatives seem to be the most promising with regard to solving the problem. One group, 350.org, has spearheaded numerous campaigns to move toward a more sustainable planet. With notable success, the organization has mobilized thousands of global citizens in support of the cause.
With the latest figures on U.S. temperatures for 2012 now available, we must inform business leaders and policymakers that the American people will no longer settle for more of the same detrimental complacency. We must reject ignorance and work toward a society that addresses today’s issues today, instead of placing the burden on future generations, when the problem will only be magnified.
Climate change skeptics beware: Following a year of relentless Midwestern droughts and extreme hurricanes along the East Coast, the NCDC’s most recent report only strengthens the argument that unfavorable changes in climate are largely the result of human activities. And though even top scientists cannot say with absolute certainty if 2013 will continue to follow climate-change trends, officials at every level should take note. New and bold policies might at be unpopular at first, but it’s certainly better to deal with that than a disastrous future.

I noticed our parties have be getting hotter and hotter over the years.
Climate science is still in its infantcy. With nearly every climate “solution” looking like austerity for the masses, like a king raising taxes beacause the rabble have too many luxury items, I am a climate solution skeptic. We have more college basketball teams than we have temperature monitoring stations in the USA. There is not enough data to force us to act NOW. Nearly 90% of climate science funding comes from one side of the debate – the side that wants more taxes and more control over the spectrum of choices by individuals or groups of individuals. Liberty allows ideas to flourish and create solutions, rent seeking quells ideas.
The riches of the internet boom brought new ideas to alternative energy, central planning kept all the alternative ideas stuck in the 1960s. Tesla started as a dream for an electric car that the rich would envy, now government subsidies and controls will doom the company to mediocrity. 
Mental health science has had more than 100 years to mature and it is also decidedly lacking in cures. To tie ourselves to climate “solutions” that only limit economic liberty, will only stunt our society for countless years and prevent that bright future that the climate scientists envision. Let us not jump to climate “solutions” too early. 
On the dark side, if man is the root of the climate problem than only WAR and mass MURDER is the solution. AUSTIN, I don’t think that you want that.
The single largest producers of greenhouse gas are the animals we grow for food.  According to the World Health Organization 1/3 of all greenhouse gasses are from this single source.  Our SAD (Standard American Diet) also causes us to feed these animals more food than it would take to end starvation on the globe.
If you really want to set the doomsday clock back, start with your fork and what is at the end of it. You can do more to cut greenhouse gasses by giving up animal protein one day a week than you can by cutting 1000 miles of driving.

Chuck Hagel’s nomination for secretary of defense has drawn a lot of ire for many reasons, but one criticism that should be discarded is in regard to a past comment with clear anti-gay sentiments. His recent apology aside, continued focus on the comment not only detracts from serious debate of Hagel’s qualifications for the position but also does nothing to advance gay rights.
Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, has been slammed by opponents and gay rights activists for a 1997 comment he made about then-President Bill Clinton’s nomination of James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. Though he did not initially oppose the nomination, Hagel later withdrew his support on the grounds that Hormel, an “openly, aggressively gay” man, would not effectively represent the best interests of the United States abroad.
He has since backtracked, saying after the comment resurfaced a few weeks ago that his statement was “insensitive” and going on to say that he is “fully supportive of ‘open service’ and committed to LGBT military families.”
For the sake of furthering more serious debate over whether he is qualified to head the United States’ defense policy during the upcoming term, the public and its representatives need to accept his apology and move on to considerations more directly related to the responsibilities of defense secretary.
Hagel’s views on gay rights could have an impact on the implementation of the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell. As a senator, he supported DADT, but has since said he would support the Obama administration in its repeal if he becomes the next secretary of defense.
Though it is true that an apology does not make everything better, especially in the political world, a poorly thought-out comment made years ago should not discount Hagel’s word on how he would treat the repeal of DADT and the treatment of gay military members, nor should it have so much bearing on whether Hagel becomes secretary.
Former U.S. Ambassador to Romania Michael Guest has weighed in on the debate in support of Hagel, and he is openly gay. He points out that Hormel accepted Hagel’s apology almost as soon as it was made, yet no one else has. Guest asks why these people should “freeze-frame” one comment made over a decade ago “even as many of us … acknowledge that America’s understanding of, and attitudes toward, sexual orientation and gender identity are changing rapidly.”
By forgiving and forgetting an intolerant comment made in the past, gay rights supporters would not be abandoning the cause — in fact, such forgiveness would be a step forward for cultural change and would refocus discourse.
Moreover, failing to evaluate Hagel on his entire record of public service would be a disservice to America and to those affected by its defense policy abroad. The most important thing to consider in choosing the next secretary of defense is deciding whether the candidate would be able to defend America at home and abroad in the most peaceful and least deadly way possible. It is safe to say that Hagel’s opinion of homosexuality is not the best measure of his competence in this regard.
None of this is to say that gay rights in the military should not be a factor in choosing a secretary of defense. Instead, it should be one of many considerations in Hagel’s upcoming Senate confirmation hearing and must not eclipse all other factors. The apology has been made and accepted by many; it’s time to proceed unimpeded by distracting commentary.

It is easy to say “NO” to any nominee. Let us consider what a nominee has done to qualify himself or herself to be the nominee. What actions has a nominee taken to show qualities and values? What qualities and values SHOULD a Defese Secretary have? Remember that in the past this cabinet office had a decidedly different name. What are we looking for: Likability? Honor? Loyalty? Warmongering? Infidelity? Hate? Violence? Stragic thinking? Executive experience? Ruthless? Are we looking for a Boy Scout, a Hell’s Angel, Peacenik or a Pink Pistol?

Frat bros everywhere, rejoice: The much anticipated book version of the wildly popular website Total Frat Move, affectionately referred to as TFM by its fans, has been released Tuesday.
The book sets out to provide the public with a national update on college fraternities, claiming that Greek life today “makes Animal House look like a Pixar movie.” It promises a hilarious and enjoyable reading experience, tracking the journey of college freshman Townes Prescott as he encounters the college party scene for the first time.
Current and former college students alike might find themselves smiling at the familiarity of the classic college experiences he describes, such as Prescott’s first college party, first college hookup and initiation into his fraternity.
Other familiar issues are introduced to the reader as well, most notably the freedom that ensues following the separation from one’s parents and a failed attempt to make that classic long-distance high-school relationship work.
The book seemingly intends to be every teenage boy’s dream and every mother’s nightmare. TFM flaunts a barrage of alcohol, drugs and debauchery from page one, said W.R. Bolen, the book’s author.
“The point of me writing it was to create the most entertaining and hilarious book possible, focused on capturing the unique insanity that comes with this incomparable lifestyle,” Bolen said. “I want people to have the [best] time they’ve ever had reading a book. Personally, I can’t get through a chapter without wanting to go out and rage.”
The website that inspired the book rose to notoriety over the past few years for its postings about fraternity life in college, amassing comments and stories from Greek communities across the United States.
The site was so successful that it garnered the attention of literary agent Byrd Leavell, who submitted an inquiry to the TFM website.
“I came across the message, we got in contact with him and the next thing I knew I was writing this thing,” Bolen said. “A few months of writing later, Byrd sold the book to Ben Greenberg at Grand Central Publishing, and the rest is history.”
Bolen started his career writing for TFM in college. The original founders of TFM, Madison Wickham and Ryan Young, were two of Bolen’s older fraternity brothers. They reached out to Bolen during his last semester of college and he began writing for TFM, launching the “Columns” section. A few weeks before graduation, they offered him a job as a staff writer, and Bolen was brought on as TFM’s first employee.
“Writing was always something I wanted to do and I was already working as the staff writer for TFM, but I never would’ve imagined the opportunity to write a book would come just weeks after I graduated,” Bolen said.
As far as inspiration for the actual material inside the book goes, everything was either ripped from events in Bolen’s life, friends of his or stories he had heard.
“It was obviously very important to me that the book be as real as possible,” Bolen said.  “I made sure there was inspiration behind everything, instead of just [making stuff up] and slapping it down on paper.”
Bolen is new to publishing, but he said the creative process ran pretty smoothly, even if it did go by in a blur.
“The writing part was a nice little crash course for me as a first-time author. It turns out that writing a book isn’t like writing an essay for class, or writing a column to post on your comedy website,” Bolen said. “Fortunately, I got the hang of it pretty quickly.”
And it’s a good thing he did, as Bolen has crafted a tome of over-the-top collegiate hijinks that will likely trigger a bit of nostalgia in many who peruse it.
“[The book will] make you wish you were still in college, wish you’d done more when you were there or want to go out right now,” Bolen said.
k
Never forget!
I heard WR Bolen skipped a book signing to go dove hunting.

New Eating in LA
As 2012 came and went, so did many restaurants in Los Angeles. But the new year ushered in an upspring of brilliant and novel eateries that are hopefully here to stay. From modern gastropubs to authentic Italian pizzerias, the melting pot of cuisines in this city continues to impress.
BESTIA
Hidden among the tall warehouses in Downtown’s Arts District is Bestia, an Italian restaurant that specializes in incredible appetizers and pizzas. Bestia is no ordinary Italian restaurant. At dinner, the lights that hang above patrons’ heads and shine against the brick walls make for a trendy ambiance. The chatter and the clanging of silverware make the experience slightly more intimate. But the food, most of all, is what makes Bestia so great. To start, try the Midolla al Forno a Legna, the roasted marrow bone with porcini breadcrumbs and aged balsamic.  Or perhaps the beef carpaccio with rich parmigiano cream and wild arugula. One thing is certain – the artisan pizza is a must at Bestia. The ingredients are fresh and unlike that of many pizzerias, incorporating surprising ingredients such as anchovies, scallions, brussel sprouts and housemade salami. A dinner here will surely be one to remember.
Muddy Leek
A quaint gastropub-inspired eatery in Culver City, Muddy Leek embodies the small-plate dining experience. Almost everything on their menu is meant to be shared, so it’s advisable to bring a couple of adventurous friends along in order to taste everything this strangely named restaurant has to offer. There is duck with cranberry kumquat relish and an earthy broccolini spring roll, as well as diver scallops from Maine with a touch of orange-braised fennel. Charcuterie is taken seriously here. Fancy some duck rillettes and bitter orange? Crab and harissa with crispy and fragrant poppadoms? They’re all worth a try. And there’s no better way to end a meal than with one of their desserts -— namely their toasted coconut panna cotta with tangy lime meringue and coconut wafers.
Eat This Café 
At first glance, the menu at this Hollywood cafe seems a little too ordinary. There are no candied-jalapeño pecans or caviar-infused oysters to be seen anywhere on this menu. But what each and every patron comes to find out after a meal at Eat This Café is that the food is carefully prepared and incredibly fresh. There is something for everyone here, be it a raw kale salad with fingerling potatoes, asparagus and refreshing mango avocado yogurt dressing for the enthusiastic vegetarian or a classic corn beef Reuben with melty swiss cheese for the meat lover. Aptly named, Eat This Café is not for sipping espressos -— it’s for enjoying well-prepared, authentic food.
Bar Amá
Inspired by memories of food and family, Chef Josef Centeno, the owner of the extremely successful Bacö Mercat, opened Bar Amá, an interpretation of Tex-Mex cuisine, combining the rich culinary culture and tradition of Mexico and the United States. The “Amá” in “Bar Amá” means “mother,” and through Centeno’s food, it’s easy to see that the food he serves is just that personal. Mom’s Mexican fried rice, Amá’s enchiladas and Dad’s burgers are just some of the menu items that feature the traditional comforts of home. There are, of course, other dishes that are a little less traditional, offering a twist on what Centeno’s Amá would normally make. Take the snapper ceviche and tuna cruda, for instance. The former is a delicious chilled dish with tomatillo, red chile, onion and mango and the latter is savory, with ahi tuna, pumpkin seeds, mole chile oil and apples to give it that tang and zest. But above all, the puffy tacos cannot be overlooked. Choose from cheesy potato, grilled shrimp, carne guisada or pork barbacoa and prepare to enjoy a tasty, texturally vivid experience.
Maccheroni Republic
Tucked away in a small plaza, a couple of blocks away from the Grand Central Market, Maccheroni Republic is a pasta restaurant that stays true to its Italian roots. With waiters elaborating on specials in thick Italian accents and the smells of garlic and olive oil wafting in from the kitchen, this is as close to Italy as it gets in Downtown Los Angeles. Think hand-pulled noodles, homemade sausages and carefully crafted sauces. It’s a quaint place, with its granite tables and gorgeous interior pieces, but the food is tremendous. The fettuccine is recommended by waiters, with Venetian braised duck sauce, as well as the ravioli di zucca, pumpkin ravioli covered in decadent truffle cream sauce. But there is no “right” pasta. Everything at Maccheroni Republic is excellent, and multiple trips may be required.
 
Whether it might be trying new foods or eating out more, make it a resolution to enjoy at least one of these new and fantastic places in Los Angeles.

Like a poorly drawn caricature at a county fair, the highly anticipated film Gangster Squad is only an empty sketch of a picture — all outline and no filling.
It looked so good on paper. A debonair Ryan Gosling, a tortured Josh Brolin, a sexy Emma Stone, Nick Nolte and Anthony Mackie in a ’40s period flick about the notorious L.A. gangster Mickey Cohen, played by the venerable Sean Penn. Sex, drugs, violence, beautiful clothes — the movie was supposed to have it all.
Yet instead of capitalizing on such great potential, Gangster Squad always feels like a movie that should be funnier, should be smarter, should be darker and much, much better. Director Ruben Fleischer wanted the film to be this generation’s Goodfellas, but Martin Scorsese didn’t get to where he is today by blindly following the rules. As Ryan Gosling’s character says, “You gotta die of something.” And he doesn’t mean by watching this rather boring film.
The movie employs every textbook gangster trope — Josh Brolin plays haunted war vet O’Mara who puts together a ragtag group of police officers from all backgrounds to take down the evil Mickey Cohen. Cohen’s gal (Emma Stone), by the way, is a bombshell who just has to fall in love with one of the officers.  This plotline might have excited the audience if it hadn’t been seen so many times before.
That’s Gangster Squad’s main problem. Each plot twist is just as predictable as the one before it, each character is such a thinly written piece of screenwriting that you feel as if you’re in a videogame instead of watching lives play out onscreen, and each scene of intense violence makes you jovial because you don’t have to listen to contrived dialogue once again.
It would be one thing if the actors had decided to dive headfirst into their roles and give it everything they’ve got, but unfortunately it appears as if none of the talent decided to show up on their respective shooting days. Lead Josh Brolin is the only one that exhibits some sort of emotion, while his wife Connie (Mireille Enos) offers a nice rooted performance, one void of caricature and ridiculosity. When she cries, the audience cries, and when she’s had enough, she reflects the audience’s sentiments exactly.
The others? Well, Ryan Gosling’s squeaky-voiced lady-killer role is one of the least hackneyed performances in the film. Of course there’s a nice black officer who wants to take down Cohen to save his neighborhood from heroin. Of course there’s a nice Mexican officer who everyone else calls racist names but ends up respecting. And the two actors playing them, Anthony Mackie and Michael Peña, both excellent in other films, seemingly checked out of this one. When you’re in a gangster film, you have to step up the energy to more than just a soft whisper.
And on the opposite end of the spectrum, Sean Penn decided that there is no such thing as too much energy. Acting as if we were in a Shakespeare play, Penn decides to push Mickey over the edge, showing us not a man obsessed with power, driven by greed, but a cartoon villain, that could easily be put out with a large hammer.
There’s no real danger, nothing really to lose. People die, often in horrible ways, so that Fleischer could show off his special effect skills, but none of the characters are really worth crying over.
The film obviously aims to honor the gangster classics that have come before it. But by honoring them, Gangster Squad forgot to freshen up its material, and create an entirely new story. Just how fresh butter can’t make a piece of stale bread taste good, not even the glossy production design and eye-opening violence make this film interesting.
What makes gangster films legendary is the perfect mixture of thriller, drama, romance and a touch of comedy. But the laughs are scarce, the romance yawn-inducing and the thrill and drama stripped away by trite subplots. If the audience knows what’s coming, it takes the excitement out of the ride.

I don’t understand a variety of things. I don’t understand people who choose — without being physically threatened — to major in economics. I don’t understand why tourists flock to Times Square on New Year’s Eve to see a completely unsatisfying ball drop. And I don’t understand people who put ketchup on their eggs.
But though I might not understand most things that are considered “normal” and upon graduation will be forced to learn how to rent an apartment, pay taxes and figure out how the stock market works, I somehow get the crazy world of fashion.
Now, when people say that they’re into “fashion,” nine times out of 10, they’re misspeaking. What they’re trying to say is that they love everything to do with clothes, jewelry and more. They think that by memorizing obscure pre-fall runway shows, that somehow proves how stylish they are.
But being obsessed with the fashion world does not mean that you are a stylish dresser. As the famous Coco Chanel once said, “Fashion changes, but style endures.” When you know fashion, you can accurately rattle off the creative directors of each major fashion house in Paris. When you’re stylish, you don’t give a crap about who’s the creative director of each house, as long as the clothes they create inspire you.
Those who are too cool or too busy to put time into their appearance don’t realize that fashion is not necessarily all about vain appearances. No, when you wake up in the morning and decide what you’re going to wear, you are essentially telling the world what kind of person you are. You put on jeans? You’re low-key and go for the classic. You put on a dress? Why, how soft, you must be a nice person (fools them every time). You’re wearing all black? Move back to New York, Tisch transfer.
Your style is an immediate reflection of your personality that day. Mondays? I wake up early and put on jeans and sneakers and a pair of sunglasses that say “Talk to me and I cut you.” Tuesdays? Don’t have class till 3:30— look at me in my fun dress with a smile!
To understand this concept is to truly understand fashion, and not just “know” it. To those die-hard fans, fashion is the most ridiculous yet important thing in the world. We all need clothes — legally — and most of us have a tendency to gravitate toward certain kind of clothes to such a degree that we fall into a rut. That’s why every student at ‘SC should make a pledge to try something different.
This is 2013. We survived the apocalypse. No more throwing USC sweatshirts over our clothes as an easy way to get through the day. No more wearing the same pair of Converse since the ninth grade because they’re “comfortable” — they also smell incredibly bad.
So let’s agree to a new list of the Ten Fashion Commandments for Spring of 2013. Don’t break any of the commandments, or else God will inflict her wrath. And in fashion heaven, God is Coco Chanel, and she is not forgiving.
1. Thou shall not wear yoga booty shorts to class. Yes, they are comfortable. Yes, for some reason boys love the sight of a gal in them. But, honestly, they’re way too short to get away with. Just because it’s “spandex” doesn’t make it class-appropriate. We can see a sliver of your butt cheeks, and it is not a cute look.
2. Thou shall choose the best footwear possible for thy outfit. While you may want to wear sneakers with everything, unfortunately sneakers do not go with everything. Conversely, don’t wear heels to class, it does not make you look better when you have to hobble around University Park.
3. Thou shall wear clothes that actually fit thee. This means no too-tight jeans as “inspiration” to lose weight. This means a shirt that actually fits and doesn’t look like a tent. You look your best self when you’re the most comfortable, so stop torturing yourself.
4. Thou shall wear clothes that are neither too old nor too young for me. Pantsuits at twenty? No. Pigtails at twenty? No. You’re graduating and you still don’t have a decent tie? Not okay. Dress your age.
5. Thou shall be more adventourous when it comes to experimenting with trends, but not when said trend breaks commandment numbers three and four. Just because leather leggings are in does not mean that everyone can try them. Just because Kanye West can pull off a kilt doesn’t mean that every guy can. Know your limits. Experiment, but stay relatively normal.
6. Thou shall not purchase knockoffs. Not only does it encourage a black market that costs the fashion world millions of dollars a year, no knockoff is a good knockoff. People can smell a knockoff from a mile away. A $10 purse from Forever 21 looks better than a fake Coach bag. Trust me.
7. Thou shall stay away from all Ed Hardys. I can understand people’s fascination with Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister, but there’s no excuse for Ed Hardy. Just stop.
8. Thou shall not dress according to other people’s wishes. Unless it involves other people saying that Ed Hardy is okay, because it is never okay. If you have friends that tell you it’s okay, you need to get new friends.
9. Thou shall not make fun of other people for the way that they dress. Your classmate wants to be seen as the kid with the Crocs, or else he wouldn’t wear the Crocs. This commandment does not apply, however, if a person is wearing Ed Hardy. Don’t make fun of them, take them to a mall and get them the help that they need in the form of less rhinestones.
10. Thou shall look to thy ancestors for inspiration. It turns out your mother was quite the fashionable gal in the ’80s. Every trend makes a comeback.
Whatever you think about fashion — dumb, amazing, riveting, overhyped, ridiculous — you can’t deny the sort of power it has in our lives. It’s something that impacts almost every single person on this planet, something that we take for granted cause it’s always been there.
Our style represents who we are not only to the people around us, but for those looking back in the years to come. I cringe every time I think about showing photos of myself during the early 2000’s to my grandkids one day. Those beaded cornrows and bandana tops seemed like a good idea at the time.
But that’s what fashion is here for. It’s here to excite, to bore, to transform us. It adapts with us, along for this ride of evolution. So instead of fighting it, hop on the bandwagon. It’s way easier to understand fashion than to ignore it.
Where we go, it goes, and that’s the way it’ll always be.

If imitation is supposed to represent the highest form of flattery, then famous electronic dance music DJs such as Skrillex, Avicii, Major Lazer and Deadmau5 must certainly think DJ Savant is bowing down to them.
Electronic Dance Musician · This is the fifth album produced by Savant in the last 13 months. His new album boasts 22 unique tracks. – Courtesy of Fixt Publicity
 
The Norwegian’s new album Alchemist offers a surprisingly eclectic mix of sounds and styles, but unfortunately, his attempt to be versatile only translates as a poor man’s attempt at a “Best of EDM” compilation. It is not that Savant isn’t talented; in fact, Alchemist is actually a great listen, full of songs that could become iconic on their own. The problem, however, lies in his lack of a distinguishing style that radiates throughout the whole album.
The opening track, “Mother Earth,” offers a promising start. Pseudo-synth violins strike a nerve in the listener while the beat crafts a perfect tune for those long car rides in L.A. traffic. Set to a perfect pace — not too quick that your head hurts, but not too slow that it makes you fall asleep — “Mother Earth” is a true mark of ingenuity. Yet, just as “Mother Earth” gets the album off to a good start, the songs that follow begin to bring it down. “Sky Is The Limit (feat. Donny Goines)” is a fun track, as is “Sledgehammer,” but the latter is such an obvious rip-off of some of Skrillex’s best work that it’s hard for electronic music devotees to get through it without gritting their teeth.
After all, DJs gain their fame based on their signature styles of music. Fans of Skrillex, for instance, flock to him for his energetic mixture of heartfelt vocals with overpowering, hair-raising, body-tingling dubstep drops, while Calvin Harris and David Guetta are known for their R&B-infused, straight-from-the-Ibiza-beaches techno hits. And it’s almost impossible not to smell a reggae-influenced Major Lazer tune from a mile away. To make your mark as an EDM DJ, you have to become one with your sound, but Alchemist reads more as a textbook manual for popular EDM rather than an expression of who the artist is.
While listening, it’s almost impossible not to ask, “Wasn’t this on [insert electronic DJ here]’s last album?” Between the third song “Sledgehammer” and 13th song “Bananonymous” on the 22-track album, Alchemist offers no breakthroughs. No track truly excites or inspires, which is a must if a fan is going to shell out big money to see you work the decks at a rave. But as soon as “The Horror” starts, Alchemist takes a rare turn. Instead of nosediving into more pseudo-Top 10 EDM plastic, the track shows us just who Savant could be as a musician.
“I’m tired of being human,” is the opening line of the song and from that moment you know that you’re going to be in for an interesting ride. When the track drops into a rock-based beat, the combination of devastating lyrics, electronic production and heavy metal styling manages to excite.
“The Horror” is the kind of a song that could define an artist, but immediately after the track, Savant decides to revert back to his habit of jumbled beats and tunes indistinguishable from one another. His last song could have perhaps attempted to wrap this confusing package together, yet “Sayonara” is another song that appears to have come from nowhere and in no way comes even close to matching any of the other tracks on the album. The strongest EDM DJ can put out an album with songs that are individualistic but also tied together with a common style and atmosphere, which allows its audience to experience the whole album in one sitting. The only continuity that Alchemist has is its devotion to electronic music. Is Savant really producing tracks that he loves, or just ones that he thinks will make him loved? Die-hard fans will certainly agree that listening to the album would not be fatal, yet when there are so many better options at a higher quality, why settle?
But for those who are new to the EDM scene, Alchemist might be a great way to introduce yourself to this strange and fantastic world. Though the genre’s greats, such as Skrillex, Major Lazer and Swedish House Mafia, might be harder for beginners to appreciate right off the bat, Alchemist gives listeners a taste of what’s to come and serve all of your beginner needs.
Hopefully, Savant’s next album will show a mark of growth and a focus on a consistant style and tone. Though artists may change and adapt over the years, they always stay true to their roots. Savant just needs to plant the seeds first.

Vaccinations · Experts say students can still protect themselves against the flu by getting vaccinations late in the winter season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
With the winter season in full swing, many students have desperately tried to avoid the ongoing influenza epidemic. According to a report by the California Department of Public Health, it is not too late to get vaccinated.
It is recommended that everyone get a flu shot given the increase in flu activity in California, according to the latest FluView report, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The best defense against the flu is getting vaccinated,” Dr. Ron Chapman, director of the CDPH, said in the report. “This year’s vaccine is an excellent match against this year’s influenza strains    … Our flu season may not peak for several more weeks, so I encourage everyone to get vaccinated to protect not only themselves, but those with whom they come into contact.”
According to Sharon E. Orrange, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, the flu season is still clearly on the rise, especially in Los Angeles.
“We are clearly on an upswing in Los Angeles on reported cases of the influenza A (H3N2) strain,” Orrange said. “The strain we have now has a history of being more aggressive.”
The effectiveness of the vaccine in defending people against the flu virus partially depends on how well the vaccine matches the strains of the virus prevalent during the flu season. According to the CDC, the predominant influenza A (H3N2) virus was tested to have a 99.4 percent match to the type of strain that the vaccine protects against. However, the match for the second-most common strain tested in the study, the influenza B virus, was found to have only a 66.7 percent match to the vaccine.
With the reports of influenza only increasing, Orrange warns that we have yet to see the last of this flu season.
“The flu started earlier this year than it has in over a decade,” Orrange said. “We haven’t peaked yet. We clearly will be going into February.”
Though some students may think that it is too late to get the vaccine, Orrange warns that they are still susceptible to the virus because of the extended flu season.
“If you haven’t been vaccinated yet, it’s still worth it to get the vaccination,” Orrange said.
Students interested in getting the flu vaccine can visit the new USC Engemann Student Health Center Monday through Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.

Rossier School of Education Dean Karen Gallagher has been designated a Pahara-Aspen Education fellow, a prestigious title for individuals dedicated to entrepreneurial reform and revolutionizing the public education system.

The award is an honorable form of recognition for Gallagher’s litany of achievements and educational advances. The first dean to receive this accolade, Gallagher has established the Asia Pacific Rim International Study Experience, directed the effort to bring Math for America to Los Angeles and led the creation of USC Hybrid High School in September of last year. A champion of online education, Gallagher designed USC Hybrid High School as a charter school targeting students likely to drop out or face exceptional difficulties while pursuing their educations.
“The iconic ivy-covered college campus has its place, but [it does] not work for everyone,” Gallagher wrote in an article for the Huffington Post. “More and more learners are opting for online study. They need the flexibility and the ability to learn, if not at one’s own pace, then in one’s own space.”
Some students agree that the type of learning Gallagher advocates should be a viable option. To Adam Werksman, a freshman majoring in political science, the concept of USC Hybrid High School can have a positive effect on those seeking a way to enter the workforce.
“It’s a great idea, especially in this economy,” Werksman said. “[It’s great] for people re-entering the workforce, stay-at-home moms, veterans or people who didn’t go to college but now see that in this workplace, a college degree is necessary to secure the job that they want.”
Courtney Chism, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, noted that it could be especially effective in promoting justice with the struggling students that are USC Hybrid High’s focus.
“I don’t think education should not be a privilege,” Chism said. “It should be a right.”
Gallagher’s commitment toward improving the educational experience of those facing hardships comes after years of pursuing goals while facing hardships of her own.
“My mom taught me to rally the troops and get the support you need — even under less than ideal circumstances,” said Gallagher in an article on CrossCut.com. “It has made me dedicated to building education environments where every student, regardless of personal circumstance, can learn and succeed.”
Gallagher’s efforts spark confidence in those who are skeptical of the public education system. Janice Park, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering and recent public high school graduate, approves of such efforts.
“It’s nice to hear someone is trying to change the system,” Park said.
Ji Min Shin, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering, noted the significance of Gallagher being a practitioner of education both in and out of the classroom.
“It’s important to practice,” Shin said. “It works better.”
Gallagher remains enthusiastic about the current reforms as well as the ones she and her faculty are continuing to develop.
“With our robust platforms, students across the world have the opportunity to enroll in the finest graduate programs in education … and to be lifelong USC Trojans with all the benefits and resources,” Gallagher said. “As we continue to build these online opportunities, more and more well-prepared teachers and educators will be going into our communities to improve student learning.”

The Interfraternity Council will be enforcing the university’s decision to prohibit fraternity pre-rush week parties. This decision comes as part of USC’s effort to change Greek life’s alcohol-centered image, as well as to reduce safety risks and associated costs.
Greek · Houses on the Row are prohibited from hosting pre-rush parties this week, because of alcohol incidents and expensive security measures. – Lauren Wong | Daily Trojan
“The university felt that alcohol was becoming too big a part of the recruitment process,” said John Martello, vice president of recruitment for IFC. “The university worried about the danger of raging parties the first week of school and hopes to change the first impression freshmen make of Greek life by eliminating those parties.”
Another factor in the decision was the huge cost associated with securing the Row during pre-rush parties in the past. During the fall 2012 semester, two nights of Welcome Back parties cost the university $20,000 in security measures, according to Martello.
The IFC had no role in the decision but supports it fully and plans to enforce it, according to IFC President Ofek Lavian.
This new policy means that no parties will be allowed on 28th Street, better known as the Row, during the first week of classes. Welcome Back Nights, the first Wednesday and Thursday of the semester that have historically been some of the most active nights on the Row, will be dry for all semesters to come.
The traditional Row moratorium during rush will follow from Jan. 18 to Jan. 26, a week of limited social activity implemented “to prepare for and effectively carry out rush,” according to the IFC website. Martello explained that all fraternities must have alcohol out of their houses by Friday, Jan. 18, and a team of IFC members will be patrolling the Row to ensure that this rule is followed. Violators will be written up and referred to the IFC judicial board.
Some students are concerned that the party ban will have a negative effect on fraternity recruitment, even though they may agree with the ban’s intention.
“I don’t think that freshmen, nor any other college student, should only think of college as a place to party,” Michael Belling, a freshman economics major in Zeta Beta Tau, said. “That being said, I don’t think pre-rush parties define that image for USC. People will form their views of college based on their entire experiences, not only on their first impressions.”
Allegra Bishop, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, supports the ban because it will reduce the number of students transported to the hospital, but is skeptical about the effectiveness of the ban in the long-run.
“There’s no way to ban parties all semester,” Bishop said. “And there’s definitely no way to keep new freshmen from making their own opinions — whether at a pre-rush party or one the very next week.”
Lavian, however, is confident that the new policy will have little effect on fraternity recruitment. He said some fraternities will be hosting off-campus events to replace the traditional pre-rush parties and that rush will continue as scheduled from Jan. 21 to Jan. 24.
“I’m 100 percent confident that the policy will have no impact [on recruitment],” Lavian said. “If anything, it will make people more open-minded about all the fraternities and will give everyone a clean slate during rush without the impression they made the week before.”

In addition to implementing several new security measures on Monday, the 280-member Dept. of Public Safety force began the semester under new leadership.
USC administrators promoted Assistant Chief John Thomas to executive director and chief, according to a memorandum issued Thursday.
Thomas’ predecessor, Carey Drayton, will assume the position of special assistant to Charlie Lane, associate senior vice president of Career and Protective Services.
The memo, which announced the changes to vice presidents, deans, directors and department heads, did not cite a reason for the leadership shuffle.
Lane and Senior Vice President of Administration Todd R. Dickey, the memo’s authors, did not immediately respond to interview requests.
The memo thanks Drayton for his seven-year tenure as chief as well as for expanding DPS operations and receiving accreditation from the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.
“He has been a major influence in higher education public safety circles and his forward-thinking strategies will continue to serve USC well into the future,” Dickey and Lane wrote.
Before joining DPS in July 2006 as captain of operations, Thomas worked as the adjutant to Los Angeles Police Department chiefs William J. Bratton, Martin Pomeroy and Bernard C. Parks, according to the memo. Thomas began his LAPD career as a field officer in 1984 and held various roles thereafter, including sergeant and lieutenant.
After his time at the LAPD, Thomas transitioned into working in higher-education security. He worked as deputy chief of police in the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Management at the University of the District of Columbia.
At USC, Thomas helped implement a new model for analyzing crimes and oversaw plans for President Barack Obama’s visit to USC in 2010.
“With more than 28 years of experience, [Thomas] is highly respected in law enforcement, having worked with some of the field’s most well-known leaders,” Dickey and Lane wrote.
The memo did not indicate Drayton’s new responsibilities. Drayton applied for a position at the University of Tennessee last February but was not hired, according to documents released by UT last year.
“It was a good decision for me [because] I want to be here at USC,” Drayton told the Daily Trojan during a phone interview in September.

The Dept. of Public Safety implemented new security measures, spurred by the October shooting, on the University Park Campus on Monday.
Security · Fences erected along the entrance on Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street caused cyclists and pedestrians to alter their routes. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
A gunman, who was unaffiliated with the school, wounded four people during an altercation with  one of the victims, who was also unaffiliated with USC. The incident occured outside of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Oct. 31, 2012.
President C. L. Max Nikias sent out a school-wide email on Nov. 6 announcing the measures, a week after the Halloween shooting.
“While the situation was resolved quickly and without physical harm to students, faculty or staff, an event such as this is a sobering reminder that we must work constantly to ensure the safety of our university community,” Nikias said in the email. “My administration has taken a number of steps over the last few years that have significantly improved the security of our campus and neighborhoods, but this incident made it clear that more must be done.”
While some of the policies, such as prohibiting USC organizations from using outside event promoters, went into effect immediately, Monday was the first day all the changes were fully enacted.
According to DPS Capt. David Carlisle, department representatives had been meeting on a weekly basis with senior members of Career and Protective Services as well as other departments to create new security measures that could go into effect in the start of the spring semester.
The policies currently only apply to the University Park Campus but might be instated on the university’s other campuses.
“While the focus at the moment is the successful implementation of these new security measures at the University Park Campus,” Carlisle said, “we are continually reviewing crime prevention and safety best practices that could impact the hospital in the future. We are always looking for new and better ways to do things to create as safe a campus as possible at the university and health center campus.”
The campus will now be closed between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. New fences have been built at the openings of Jefferson and Exposition boulevards to limit access to the school during these hours, reducing 27 existing entrances to eight that will be guarded by approximately 20 additional officers.
Students and faculty who enter campus during these restricted hours will have to present photo ID, while guests can be registered online at visitor.usc.edu.
In addition, 38 security cameras have been installed on campus and the license plate of every car that enters campus during the restricted time will be checked to ensure the car was not stolen.
Administrators do not believe that the measures will cause traffic flow problems as they are not in place during busy hours for the university.
“Students, faculty and staff members with ID will quickly be able to pass through security checkpoints,” Denzil Suite, associate vice president for student affairs, said in an email. “Initially, there were some concerns about access to events on campus, but since the restricted access does not start until 9 p.m., those concerns were alleviated because the overwhelming majority of events start before that hour.”
For events that do begin after 9 p.m., other accommodations, such as using a guest list, will be made.

Following a season-opening loss to UC San Diego, the USC men’s volleyball team is looking to re-group with a slate of matchups against top-ranked opponents.
Feather in the cap · Sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers has tallied a combined 19 kills in the season’s first two games. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The Trojans got off to a solid start in that regard, earning their first victory of the season by knocking off reigning champion and the No. 1 UC Irvine Anteaters 25-21, 25-23, 27-25 Friday night.
The Trojans atoned for their tough loss to the Anteaters in last season’s championship game in which they were swept on their home court. The victory enabled the Trojans to overcome their loss at the hands of UC San Diego, also a three-set sweep.
Sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers shined on both sides of the court, registering a team-high 12 kills to go along with six blocks. Freshman outside hitter Alex Slaught and junior opposite Tanner Jansen each notched eight kills to pace the Trojan attack alongside Feathers, while the defense was anchored by freshman libero Brooks Varni (eight digs) and sophomore setter Micah Christenson (seven digs).
The Trojans are coming off a successful 2012 campaign, one in which USC coach Bill Ferguson lost four 2011 starters, including three All-Americans. After starting slowly at 5-4, the Trojans dominated the remainder of the season to finish with a No. 2 overall ranking and 26-4 record, including an 18-4 mark in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play to earn their second straight regular season title. USC thoroughly dominated its regular season schedule, posting an 18-game winning streak, a 14-match MPSF winning streak and an 11-game home winning streak.
As the Trojans attempt to make another trip to the NCAA Championship, youth will play a major role. Ferguson leads a 2013 squad featuring 18 underclassmen (including 10 freshmen) and only one senior opposite/outside hitter Maddison McKibbin.
After lagging behind the competition during the earlier part of the 2000s, the Trojans have developed a dependable program behind Ferguson, who is in his seventh season at the helm. The two-time National Coach of the Year has guided Troy to three NCAA Final Four appearances in the last four years. The team will attempt to make up for the absences of 2012 National Player of the Year Tony Ciarelli at outside hitter and All-American middle blocker Steven Shandrick.
Following the resounding win over the Anteaters, the Trojans (1-1) will return to the Galen Center for a three-game homestand, beginning with a match against Pac-12 rival Stanford on Friday night.

After a season that failed to live up to expectations and a lackluster final attempt at redemption in the Sun Bowl, the last thing the USC football team needs is more bad news.
But the lack of depth at the cornerback position is sure to pose yet another problem.
Saying goodbye · USC will be hard-pressed to replace junior cornerback Nickell Robey’s leadership and All-Pac-12 production. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Junior cornerback Nickell Robey officially confirmed that he will declare for the NFL draft with one season of eligibility remaining.
Robey unofficially announced that he would enter the draft two weeks ago on Facebook and briefly reconsidered in the aftermath of USC’s bowl loss, but finally informed coach Lane Kiffin of his decision on Sunday.
The Florida native becomes the second player to declare for the draft early; wide receiver Robert Woods announced his decision to enter the NFL draft shortly after USC’s loss to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl.
The vacant slot left by the three-year starter won’t be easy to fill. In his career at USC, Robey demonstrated toughness and speed, earning multiple All-Pac-12 honors and winning the John McKay Award for Most Competitive Underclassman in 2011. In his 38 career starts, he recorded 163 tackles and seven interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns.
With his early departure, the Trojans lack proven players at the position.
Redshirt junior Torin Harris struggled in his appearances this season, and after being declared academically ineligible prior to the Sun Bowl, he remains a question mark heading into next year.
Other options currently on the roster, such as redshirt sophomore Anthony Brown and redshirt sophomore Josh Shaw, a converted safety, lack the experience and accolades that Robey will take with him to the next level.
On the recruiting front, Sebastian LaRue, a versatile recruit who can play multiple positions including cornerback, decommitted from the USC program. Incoming freshman Jalen Ramsey and Chris Hawkens, however, are still committed and are expected to compete right away for playing time.
Another issue still looming on the defensive side is when head coach Lane Kiffin will name his defensive coordinator. Former defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, who was let go prior to the team’s Sun Bowl loss in December, was recently hired by the Dallas Cowboys to the same position.

When former USC assistant head coach Monte Kiffin announced on Nov. 29 that he was resigning from his post to pursue NFL coaching opportunities, many questioned whether the 72-year-old would garner much attention after a disappointing stint at USC.
Yet Kiffin’s failure to meet expectations at USC did not dissuade the Dallas Cowboys from hiring the longtime NFL coach as the team’s new defensive coordinator on Jan. 11 — three days after the Cowboys controversially fired Rob Ryan, whose injury-depleted defense ranked 19 in the NFL in total yards allowed in 2012.
Kiffin earned his reputation as a defensive guru during his 13-year tenure as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive coordinator, during which he became known as the architect of the famed “Tampa 2” defensive scheme that many teams still use today. In addition to winning the Super Bowl in 2002, the Buccaneers finished in the top 10 in total defense and scoring defense in 11 of Kiffin’s 13 years.
Unfortunately for Kiffin, USC players failed to adapt to the Tampa 2, which stresses speed instead of size. In the three years prior to Kiffin’s arrival, USC defenses surrendered an average of 278.5 total yards and 14.9 points per game. Under Kiffin’s watch from 2010-12, however, USC defenses surrendered an average of 390 total yards and 24.9 points per game.
The undoubted nadir of the 2012 season occurred during a two-game stretch against Arizona and Oregon in which USC gave up a combined 1,318 yards and 101 points to the two high-powered spread offenses. Following those defensive meltdowns, an offseason shakeup on the defensive coaching staff seemed inevitable, with Kiffin representing the most likely candidate to depart given his age and reluctance to force his son, USC coach Lane Kiffin, into the unenviable position of firing or demoting his father.
With National Signing Day for high school recruits fast approaching, Lane Kiffin continues to seek an outside hire with a demonstrated knack for stopping spread offenses to replace his father. As several high-profile recruits make official visits this weekend, there is added urgency for the Trojans to announce a new defensive coordinator. Many defensive recruits are reportedly hesitant to commit to USC in blind faith before having a chance to see how they will fit into the team’s new defensive philosophies and schemes.

Behind two clutch free throws from sophomore guard Ariya Crook with less than a second to play, the USC women’s basketball team was able to extend its winning streak to a season-high four games with a 61-59 home win against Washington State on Sunday afternoon.
The Women of Troy (7-8, 4-0) were able to overcome a poor first-half shooting performance, converting on only 31.3 percent from the field during the first 20 minutes. Ultimately however, they defeated the Cougars and stayed atop the Pac-12 standings alongside rival UCLA.
The Women of Troy, who are off to their best conference start since 2005, had a 59-56 lead with 20 seconds remaining when the Cougar’s Lia Galdeira came down the court and nailed an off-balance 3-point shot with four seconds to go. After a USC timeout, the Cougar’s Ireti Amojo was called for a foul with 0.8 seconds left to send Crook to the line, where she nailed two free throws to put the game in the victory column for the Women of Troy.
“I was honestly very shocked when they fouled me on that last play and was even more surprised that it was called,” Crook said. “We huddled together and my team believed in me to hit at least one free throw to win the game.”
Crook had 14 points and a season-high nine rebounds in the win, while junior captain Cassie Harberts recorded her fifth double-double of the young season with 18 points and 10 rebounds. The team had a strong performance on the boards, out-rebounding the Cougars 49-31. Washington State (5-10, 1-3) was led by sophomore guard Tia Presley, who had 18 points at halftime, but finished with 25 points after notching only seven points in the last 20 minutes. Galdeira added 14 points of her own to the Cougar scoring, as well.
USC struggled throughout the first half, missing its first 10 shots from the field, and didn’t get its first field goal until a Crook 3-pointer at 14:30. The two teams played back and forth until the Cougars mounted a 13-2 run to take a 30-20 lead. That was countered by an 8-2 Trojan run to close out the half, down by only four at 32-28.
Very much like the first half, the second half was a seesaw battle and USC was finally able to take its first lead since the nine-minute mark of the first half with a Crook free throw at 14:25.
“In the second half, we played a lot more inside-out basketball with a lot of post entries and drives to the baskets which allowed us to get easier shots and get to the free throw line instead of relying on jump shots from the perimeter,” Harberts said.
The Women of Troy then used their size to their advantage by pounding the ball in the paint, notably by 6-foot-4 junior Kate Oliver, who would help the team get its largest lead of the game at 55-49 with 4:27 remaining. Oliver was one of three Trojan players in double figures with 10 points.
“For me to have Kate out there for most of the game, our chemistry is just going to continue to build and build,” Harberts said.
USC lived from getting to the free-throw line in the second half, making 14-18 free throws and 20-24 overall. Along with getting to the line, defense played a crucial role in USC’s success in the second half, as they held the Cougars to just 22.6 percent shooting from the field — a stark contrast to 39.4 percent in the first half.
After finishing off a two-game home stand with two crucial wins, the Women of Troy will now travel up to Northern California to play Cal on Thursday, followed by Stanford on Sunday.

The Sun Bowl didn’t go as most people thought it would. Georgia Tech, with a 6-7 record at the time, beat the Trojans 21-7 in a game most assumed USC would easily win. It was really just a fitting end to a season that was about as disastrous as they come. From preseason No. 1 in the Associated Press poll to a 7-6 record, the Sun Bowl encapsulated the season into 60 minutes: turnovers, defensive lapses and a lack of discipline.
No, senior quarterback Matt Barkley didn’t make his triumphant return from injury to lead the Trojans to a win, which would have brought in a positive offseason. Instead, he was on the sidelines, chatting it up with players, unable to really do anything. Now, there were certainly a lot of bad things that happened in this game. They will be brought up quite soon, actually. But there were a lot of good things that Trojan fans can hold onto going into the 2013 season.
First, though, are the negatives. Where to begin?
A reasonable starting point would be with Barkley’s replacement, redshirt freshman Max Wittek. Now, it’s fair to point out that it was just his second career start. He showed glimpses of brilliance against No. 1 Notre Dame in his first start, though those glimpses were hard to find against the Yellow Jackets.
Wittek overthrew junior receiver Robert Woods and sophomore All-American Marqise Lee the entire day en route to a 14-for-37 passing performance. He threw for just 107 yards and tossed three interceptions to go along with the game’s lone touchdown. It wasn’t so much the numbers that told Wittek’s story on this New Year’s Eve game. It was his decision making. He stared down receivers. He was late on most throws. Those throws sailed over receivers or into the hands of cornerbacks. It was not a good sight for fans looking for positives heading into the offseason, considering Barkley is heading to the NFL.
Perhaps more frustrating, however, was the performance of the defense. And it wasn’t that the defense even played badly. Quite the opposite, actually. The defense held up its end of the bargain; it was just put in terrible positions because of the offense’s lackluster performance.
But there were so many instances when the defense could have gotten a big third-down stop and Georgia Tech’s triple option gashed them. There were numerous long runs by Yellow Jacket quarterbacks — they even had more touchdown passes than USC did. There was a huge missed tackle by junior cornerback Nickell Robey in the red zone that seemed to be the nail in the coffin. As was the case most of the year, USC’s defense just couldn’t get off the field when it needed to. Throw in Woods’ intention to enter the 2013 NFL Draft after the game, and the whole day was disastrous.
But lost in the 14-point loss were a few positives that the Trojans can take with them, though they won’t make up for the embarrassment that took place in El Paso.
The main one was the running of junior running back Silas Redd. Redd, who was in and out of the lineup for much of the season, came back strong in the game, running for 88 yards and catching a scoring toss from Wittek. He ended up rushing for 905 yards on the season with nine touchdown runs despite missing a game and playing in two contests where he had just three carries. Redd announced that he will return to the Trojans for his senior season, which bodes well for the team.
Breaking in a new quarterback in 2013, USC will need to rely more on the running attack that coach Lane Kiffin tended to avoid. Having Redd running strong will be incredibly valuable. If he runs anything like he did against the Yellow Jackets, he should rush for more than 1,000 yards pretty easily.
And, speaking of the quarterback that will have to be broken in, it would be foolish to say Wittek is out of the running with heralded recruit Max Browne in the mix. Wittek still has a lot of potential. He has a huge arm, and that arm was evident in the game (even if it meant the pass went over Woods’ outstretched arms). He is a big, mobile quarterback who can move around the pocket and extend plays to the outside when need be. And perhaps most importantly, he is still very young. He has some time to let his head develop to where arm is. Remember, Barkley’s struggles weren’t cured overnight.
Protecting Wittek will be a trio of tackles:  freshman Max Tuerk, sophomore Aundrey Walker and redshirt junior Kevin Graf. Now, the line didn’t protect as well as it could have at times in 2012. But in the bowl game, they made some holes for the running backs and did not let Wittek get sacked. It’s little things like this that could make all the difference next season for the young signal caller.
The Sun Bowl was a pretty rough game for fans to tolerate. It was probably tough for players as well. But there were some promising signs that could bode well for the 2013 Trojans. The agony of the 2012 season has to sink in before those signs can come to fruition, though. Hopefully, it’s worth the wait.
 
The performance by the Trojans was a disgrace plain and simple. Playing against an opponent who had to
petition to get in the bowl game makes it a total disaster. What a waste of talent especially on the offensive
side of the ball. It  all falls on the head coach who needs to be replaced which is not happening.
You missed in the analysis the less-than inspired, lack of motivated playing of a team and coach who did not want to be there.   They may not have liked to be at the Sun Bowl but that’s no excuse for disparaging the host city and blowing off social engagements with the other team by arriving late to a hosted dinner.  The better team won that day, GT wanted to be there and wanted to win, they did.

The stare was telling.
It was the second half of a blowout home loss at the hands of Minnesota in early December.  USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, sitting courtside, wasn’t so much watching what was happening on the court but staring, fixated on USC coach Kevin O’Neill, who frantically paced the Galen Center sidelines.
The Trojans, again already under .500, were down, trailing the Golden Gophers by double digits as O’Neill scrambled to find the right combination of players to put on the floor. At times, he’d play two 7-footers at once, opting to insert centers Dewayne Dedmon and Omar Oraby into the lineup simultaneously. Or he’d go with a smaller lineup, playing the 6-foot-6 UC Irvine transfer Eric Wise at power forward.
And as O’Neill scrambled to find something that could re-energize his group, Haden continued to stare.
You sensed this was an evaluation that wasn’t going all that well and Haden was waiting for something, anything, to flip a switch.
Would it be that right combination of players? Would it be a restructured scheme or a new offensive attack? Maybe a few extra rosaries might do the trick.
No matter —the combinations never clicked. USC hasn’t turned its season around. And now, just more than a month later, O’Neill, in his fourth season with the program, is out of a job, fired Monday morning following an announcement from the school. He was 48-65 since being hired in June 2009.
The program really just never got on track.
Over his tenure, O’Neill offered a variety of explanations why things never did click. In year one, it was a self-imposed postseason ban in the wake of NCAA violations related to former guard O.J. Mayo. Year three, it was the rash of season-derailing injuries. By year four, it was a need for more time to help a team composed largely of transfers — a team dubbed the “Second-Chance Kids” — to gel.
No matter how sensible or credible each reason proved to be, USC never got it done with O’Neill at the helm. His team’s performance was never at a sufficient level and so, as many expected, he faced dismissal.
Under O’Neill’s watch, the Trojans ranked last among schools from the “power six” conferences, which includes the ACC, Big Ten, Big East, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC, in points per game and was second to last in winning percentage, according to ESPN Stats & Info. That includes a school single-season worst for losses with 26 a year ago.
Even for USC, which doesn’t carry much of a decorated history when it comes to men’s basketball, that’s not good enough. And at 7-10 overall this season, with nine losses in the last 13 games, there wasn’t much indication the future was any brighter. So why postpone the inevitable?
“As the season progressed, it became evident to me that we needed new leadership in our men’s basketball program,” Haden said in a statement released Monday.
That’s all that needs to be said.
This isn’t about being fair to a coach or about giving him more time and more chances. Look, the foremost reason head coaches get more time to begin with is to increase a sample size and thus give athletic administrators like Haden more time to properly evaluate their performance. He’s had that.
By now, do you think Haden needs more time to assess the program and a coach who has been on the sidelines for more than 400 college basketball games and 113 with USC?
Since the 2011 Pac-10 tournament, USC has mirrored a sinking ship — pardon the cliché. Following a 14-point win over California in the quarterfinals, O’Neill was involved in an altercation with a University of Arizona booster in a Downtown Los Angeles hotel lobby. The next day, he was suspended for the remainder of the tournament. USC would lose its semifinal game to Arizona and later its opening round NCAA tournament contest against Virginia Commonwealth. Since that altercation, USC is 13-38.
Whatever momentum the Trojans had — winning six of their last seven games following the opening-round victory over the Golden Bears — vanished. The program has yet to recover. It hasn’t felt the same since.
By this point, it’s not about being fair to O’Neill. It’s about being fair to the boosters, to alumni, to students, to fans. It’s about being fair to the players, to the program, to a $147 million, on-campus arena that opened just seven years ago.
This day was coming. Everyone knew it. Haden’s had ample time to assess O’Neill and the report card — fair or unfair — wasn’t up to par. He didn’t pass the evaluation. Such is the business.
If USC considers itself a big-time college basketball program, it might as well act like one. It did Monday. Its coach wasn’t winning — not enough anyway. So it severed ties. It’s that simple. Good for Pat Haden and good for USC.
Correction: The story incorrectly stated that Kevin O’Neill coached “more than 1,000 college basketball games.” It should have stated “more than 400 college basketball games.”

Pat Haden knows very little about basketball. A dumb ass reaction this far into the season. Real great replacement
in Bob Cantu who could not even get the head coaching job at Sacramento St. O’Neill and his staff needed to go way before the season began after last year’s debacle.  There  has to be more to the timing than meets the eyeball
test since a nice road win last Saturday ending their streak of road losses. You as a journalist should question this
decision and get all the facts surrounding it.

Amid year four of a tenure that endured the worst in school history, USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill is gone. O’Neill was fired on Monday during a morning meeting, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden announced in a statement.
O’Neill finishes his USC tenure with a 48-65 record, with last season’s abysmal record and this year’s slow start likely contributing to his dismissal. USC battled a rash of injuries while finishing 6-26 (1-17) in 2011-12, and is currently 7-10 on the year, with a 2-2 record in Pac-12 play.
KO’d · USC Athletic Director Pat Haden announced Monday that he was relieving coach Kevin O’Neill of his head coaching duties. In a little more than three seasons at the helm at USC, O’Neill compiled an overall record of 48-65. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Associate head coach Bob Cantu will take over as the interim head coach. Cantu has been with the team since 2000 and was promoted to associate head coach in 2010.
O’Neill took over the USC job in the summer of 2009 in the wake of an NCAA investigation of the program under previous coach Tim Floyd. Despite facing adversity stemming from the program’s sanctions, which included a postseason ban, the Trojans finished 16-14. O’Neill had his most successful season in 2010-11, going 19-15 and earning an NCAA tournament berth. The Trojans were defeated in the first round by Virginia Commonwealth.
Things went downhill from there. Last season, USC’s top returning player, senior point guard Jio Fontan, tore his ACL during a summer team trip to Brazil. Fontan missed the entire season, while other heavy contributors in forwards Dewayne Dedmon and Aaron Fuller, among others, missed significant time also because of injury. The Trojans’ 26 losses that season were the most in school history and presumably put O’Neill on the hot seat heading into this fall.
The Trojans had high hopes for 2012-13, as USC brought in a slew of transfers, including senior forward Eric Wise from UC Irvine and arguably the top junior college transfer in the country in junior J.T. Terrell, a former Wake Forest standout. The talent was improved over the prior season, but the early results were all too similar.
After starting the season 3-1, the Trojans lost five in a row in a difficult non-conference stretch that included losses to three ranked teams.
“We overscheduled,” Cantu said. “We should have had more bye games in there.”
At 5-8, the Trojans were the only Pac-12 squad to finish with a losing record in non-conference play. USC won its Pac-12 opener against Stanford, but then dropped winnable games against Cal and Colorado. The Trojans defeated Utah 76-59 on Saturday, but the team’s first road victory in nearly 14 months was not enough to save O’Neill’s job.
At the end of the day, it came down to winning: something O’Neill was not able to do enough of during his tenure.
“It was hard for me to evaluate him as a head coach until this year when he had enough players and veterans to compete,” Haden said in the statement. “As the season progressed, it became evident to me that we needed new leadership in our men’s basketball program.”
O’Neill is known for his loud and witty personality but also became infamous for an altercation with a University of Arizona booster in March 2011. O’Neill was previously the interim head coach at Arizona for one season as well as head coach of the NBA’s Toronto Raptors, among other NBA and college stops.
“He’s someone I’ll hopefully remain in contact with for the rest of my life,” said Fontan, who called O’Neill this morning after learning of his firing. “He taught me a lot on what it takes to be a pro at the next level, about going through life changes and how you just fight through a lot of things.”
Wise, the team’s leading scorer, also expressed surprise at the decision.
“It was shocking, but it’s just something you have to go through and we all have to deal with,” Wise said.
Cantu has never been a head coach at the college level outside of one game after O’Neill’s suspension in 2011, and was mum on whether he thinks he’ll be considered for the position over an outside replacement.
“As an assistant, your goal was always to become a head coach,” he said. “It’s always been my goal, [but] you never envision it happening this way, that’s for sure.”
The Trojans are only four games into their Pac-12 slate, giving Cantu almost half a season to make his mark.
“There are 14 games left and there are a lot of things that can happen,” Cantu said. “Anything is possible.”

Every person has experienced an awe-inspiring moment, but this winter, the Pantages Theatre brings a childhood twist to wonder with its production of Peter Pan.
The play, running Jan. 15-27, reunites star Cathy Rigby with her iconic lead role for the fifth time. Also starring in the show is Brent Barrett as both the villainous Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. Playing two roles might seem like overkill, but Barrett appreciates a good challenge.
“They’re both a lot of fun to play, but they’re very different,” Barrett said. “Most of the time, people do not know that it’s the same actor playing both the roles, so when they don’t know that, I feel like I’ve succeeded.”
Reunited · Cathy Rigby revisits her role as Peter Pan for the fifth time in the Los Angeles production. This is the first time she’s performed at the Pantages Theater since 2004 and the performance may be her last. – Courtesy of Michael Lamont
It’s interesting to note that in most major productions of Peter Pan, from the classic 1953 Disney film to the stage versions, the role of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook is played by the same actor.
“I think from the children’s perspective, the father is the bad guy,” Barrett said. “He’s the one that’s responsible. He’s got to make the money, keep the house over their head, so kids could view him as the mean adult. That transitions him to the pirate in their fantasy, which is going to Neverland.”
Hook also acts as the comic relief of the play, often with the laughs at his expense — but that doesn’t mean he isn’t the ruthless pirate children around the world have feared for generations.
“I think some people think he’s scary and some people think he’s funny,” Barrett said. “We try to make him a little scary, but without frightening the children out of the theater.”
Barrett and Rigby shared the stage in the 1993 U.S. tour of “Annie Get Your Gun,” playing the romantic leads. It took nearly two decade to get the two stars in the same production again, but not for lack of trying. After “Annie Get Your Gun” closed, Rigby was set to revive her role as Peter Pan, and the production staff approached Barrett to join her as Captain Hook. Unfortunately, Barrett had to turn down the tour.
“I’d been on the road so much that I decided that I needed to stay home for a while,” he said.
This latest tour was inspiration to hit the road once again. “I had a feeling that this would be Cathy’s last go-round with it and I wanted the chance to do it with her before she signed off, before she said goodbye.”
Though there might be doubts, since the 2004-05 tour was billed as her swan song, Barrett is confident that, at 60 years old, this will be audiences’ last chance to see Rigby flying with the aid of some pixie dust.
“You’ve got to come and see Cathy; it’s her farewell tour. I think this is it. I can almost bet you that this will be it.”
Barrett, who has played the title character of Phantom of the Opera, the heinous Hannibal Lecter and Chicago’s Billy Flynn, embraces his double role in Peter Pan, especially with the camaraderie and professional candor between him and Rigby.
“There is a nice comfort level in working with Cathy since we’ve known each other for so long,” he said. “We go out. We do our thing. We have a great time. She’s been doing it for so long, she is the quintessential Peter Pan. No one has done this show like she has.”
With the swordplay of the swashbuckling Hook, however, Barrett had to return to his roots to prepare for the role.
“I hadn’t done any sword fighting since I was in college, so that took a while to get back into my brain,” he said. “But when you’re a kid you play cowboys and Indians, you play pirates, so this is just letting your childhood fantasies run wild.”
Since many USC students grew up hearing the story of Peter and Wendy and have enjoyed many feature film adaptations, skepticism about the show’s draw is understandable, but entirely wrong.
Boasting musical numbers that only theatre audiences get to experience, participatory clapping to save Tinkerbell and Hook’s lavish red coat, Peter Pan is a story that’s meant to be experienced in person. Barrett adds that the biggest highlight of seeing the show live is also a childhood dream of many: flying.
“I think anyone, kids especially, seeing Peter Pan flying in the window for the first time, they’re mesmerized for the entire show,” Barrett said. “They’re transported to another place that you don’t get when you’re watching a movie. You know it’s all make-believe, but when you actually see a live person flying, there’s something to that that’s exhilarating and exciting for kids and adults.”
