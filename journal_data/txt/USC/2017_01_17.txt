This weekend, USC men’s basketball ascended the Rockies to challenge Colorado at the Coors Event Center, the Buffaloes’ home court 5,430 feet above sea level. Even as the air thinned, the pressure mounted on the shoulders of the Trojans. After going 1-3 in their last four contests, the Men of Troy found themselves in desperate need of a victory in Boulder. On Sunday night, they gritted through a tough matchup and willed themselves back to .500 in Pac-12 play with a 71-68 win.
Their opponents exhibited equal ferocity. Once 10-3, the ease of non-conference play felt like a distant dream for Colorado, who entered the contest 0-4 in Pac-12 play.
The Buffaloes pounced early, taking an 11-point lead only minutes after tip-off, but one Trojan could not miss. Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu scored 20 of his team’s 34 first-half points on a nearly perfect 9-of-10 from the floor. On an unusual night, USC’s sharpshooting guards took as many 3-point attempts, but made only one. Meanwhile, Colorado, ranked 11th in the Pac-12 in 3-point shooting at 33 percent, shot 7-of-11. Turnovers prevented the Buffaloes from extending their lead, but they clung to a one-point lead at half.
In an exhilarating second-half, the teams traded points, and the lead swung like a pendulum. With Metu in foul trouble, USC sought other sources of offense. Junior guard Elijah Stewart dropped 11 points in the half, and freshman guard Jonah Mathews nailed a pair of timely threes. Nevertheless, USC never found its rhythm outside, finishing the game with a season-low 3-point performance: 3-of-19.
The Trojans hustled, though, refusing to drop a fourth game in five. They mustered 17 offensive rebounds and forced as many turnovers. While they scored 20 points off turnovers, Colorado scored only five. Thanks to Metu, they also won the battle in the paint, outscoring the Buffs 36-22. By doing so, USC successfully weathered Colorado’s storm of threes.
Yet, with 43 seconds to play, victory appeared to slip through the Trojans’ fingers. At the end of an outstanding defensive possession, Colorado’s Xavier Johnson heaved a Hail Mary from three to avoid a shot clock violation. By some miracle, his high-arcing shot found nothing but net, and the Buffaloes grabbed a one-point lead.
On USC’s ensuing possession, Metu got the ball in the post. He exploited his one-on-one matchup for the final time, nailing a jump hook to finish with a career-high 24 points. On defense, Metu stopped Colorado’s George King from getting a shot in the lane. He forced him to lose control of the ball, and Metu quickly recovered it and passed to Stewart. Stewart nailed both his free throws to give USC a 71-68 lead with 12 seconds to play.
Refusing to foul, the Trojans played stingy defense. King managed to launch a three at the buzzer, but the effort fell just short, and suddenly USC had won its first game in Boulder in program history.
Now at 3-3 in Pac-12 play, USC faces No. 16 Arizona at the Galen Center on Thursday night. After a weekend bout with Arizona State, the Trojans will remain at home to play No. 4 UCLA. With two ranked opponents on the horizon, Sunday’s win over Colorado could prove to be a key momentum builder.

After earning a second-place finish in the NCAA Championship, seven athletes on the men’s water polo team earned academic distinctions through the MPSF. A total of seven Trojans were named to the MPSF All-Academic Scholar-Athlete honor roll, with five athletes earning added distinctions for finishing the season with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher.
The distinction is awarded to student-athletes who are upperclassmen and maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 throughout the semester. The Trojans often perform well on the list, earning four honors last year, but this season’s achievement was one of the highest in the program’s history. 
Junior utility Mihajlo Milicevic made the list for the second year in a row with a team-high 3.68 GPA after also receiving the NCAA Elite 90 Award, which recognizes the top student-athletes in the country. He was joined by junior drivers Matteo Morelli and Lazar Pasuljevic in their second years of recognition.
Earning their first MPSF distinctions were junior driver Blake Edwards, redshirt sophomore drivers Tim Leong and Brock Hudnut and redshirt freshman driver Daniel Leong.
The athletes honored made an impact for the Trojans in the pool as well as in the classroom this season. Edwards led the team in scoring with 42 goals on the season, followed closely by Morelli who notched a total of 37. Together, the team took the 2016 MPSF Championship and secured a spot in the NCAA title match for the 12th season in a row before losing in an upset to Cal.

Earlier this month, Xavier University became the only place in the United States that students can order pizza from a vending machine 24 hours a day. However, that may change soon. Demand for such a unique dining option has been on the rise: Businesses and schools in 20 U.S. states and Canada have inquired about bringing a pizza ATM to their property, and it seems likely that they will soon be spreading across the continent. As the availability of such a novel way to get dinner increases, students at USC should have access to such a unique treat.
Most pizza places around USC are far from campus and can be inconvenient to reach. Though California Pizza Kitchen has an establishment on campus, USC needs more options for students who want to avoid the long lines common at Ronald Tutor Campus Center during lunchtime. Fitting a pizza run into a three-class day can be very tricky and, by the end, too tiring to deserve the investment. Hungry students who are crunched for time are forced to be satisfied with dry, processed vending machine food that’s not nearly as filling or satisfying as a hot slice of pizza. As a result, students often end up spending more money on unsatisfying snacks that only increase their intake of empty calories. The solution to this problem comes all the way from Europe in the form of the pizza vending machine, invented by a French company called Paline. 
Paline is collaborating with distribution networks to make the dream of easily accessible and delicious meals a reality. The process is fairly simple: Cooks make the pizza in the college kitchen and store it in the refrigerated portion of the ATM. The students then select the toppings they desire on the touch screen and order the pizza, which is then heated in an oven for only three minutes before being dispensed, hot and fresh, into the machine slot. The minimal amount of time required makes it much more preferable to pizza parlors, where standing in line and waiting for the pizza can take up to 30 minutes.
Besides being inconvenient, hot food can often be expensive, but the low price of Paline’s vending machine pizza won’t break the bank. At $9 to $10, each pizza is competitively priced with other pizzas available to students, and the treat would be an ideal dining option for students all over campus. Though our campus center is a fairly convenient eating location, pizza ATMs would remove the need for walking there and waiting for order preparation, all while worrying about potentially being late to class. The pizza ATM would respond to an ever-growing demand for quick, tasty food — look no further than the success of the new cupcake ATM over the past semester. 
The pizza ATM is a savory, much-needed twist on a familiar concept. It is a simple yet ingenious solution to the perennial student question: What will I eat next?

Access to feminine care products is very limited on USC’s campus. Though they are available in the Engemann Student Health Center, even basic 25-cent tampon dispensers are missing from most women’s restrooms. Though the school has implemented many different programs to relieve students’ stress and increase their comfort, providing free feminine care products in restrooms is a necessary next step that the school needs to take. Despite being hailed as a luxury item by many state legislatures and taxed in 45 states, tampons and other feminine care items are a part of women’s basic needs. It is imperative that USC begins to offer free tampons and pads in restrooms across campus to increase accessibility and dispel the taboo surrounding feminine healthcare products. Precisely because this sort of program has been successfully implemented at many universities, including Brown and Emory, USC must adopt a similar policy. 
Providing free pads and tampons in restrooms is necessary to improve and maintain women’s health on campus. Imagine what would happen if universities stopped providing free toilet paper or soap in restrooms — there would be a public uproar because it would affect students’ well-being and basic sanitary needs. Tampons and pads should be no different. Getting your period and not having any supplies on hand is frustrating and stressful. Additionally, pads and tampons, as necessary as they are, are incredibly expensive. It is estimated that women spend about $18,000 on tampons and other menstrual items during their lifetimes. Most states also impose a tax on tampons, treating them as a luxury item instead of a necessity, making the price even higher. At the end of the day, periods are unavoidable. If the University were to provide tampons for free in restrooms, it would be a major financial and stress relief for many students. 
Increasing access to menstruation items and making them commonplace in restrooms across campus will allow for more discussions about this taboo topic to take place and hopefully remove some of the stigma surrounding menstruation. Menstruation has been a taboo topic as far back as the first century, and tampon and pad companies focus their advertisements on how their products are the most discreet and unnoticeable. Because of this, periods are still shrouded in mystery, usually only discussed by women in whispers. The shame that women feel about their periods is absolutely ridiculous. Having a regular period is a sign of a healthy, functioning body. It is imperative that both men and women be educated on menstruation and that the negative stereotypes associated with periods are removed. Just last year, rapper T.I made headlines when he said he would not vote for a female president because  “women make rash decisions emotionally.” Additionally, despite affecting roughly half the population, there is a lack of scientific articles on periods, and the ones that exist focus on how periods make women emotionally unstable. It is clear that society still has very backwards beliefs about menstruation. Allowing for discussions about menstruation on campus and beginning to normalize periods may slowly change these sexist and harmful attitudes, and this change can be started by treating feminine care products similarly to toilet paper. 
There are some concerns about programs like this that have kept them from being implemented at other universities. During a general assembly meeting at Cornell University, many students were opposed to a free tampon program because they feared that the program could be abused. Though this is a valid point, the same is true of any free resource provided by a school. For example, students who will never benefit from tampon dispensers, like biologically male students, may need to subsidize their cost. However, that possibility does not outweigh the value that such free resources have to those who use them fairly. Providing these supplies can help increase productivity, make students feel more comfortable and is an easy way to help improve women’s health and sanitation. If the school can afford to put condoms on every floor of every residence hall and in the health center, a small portion of the $1.4 million student health services budget can certainly be allocated toward improving women’s well-being. The overall benefits of providing free tampons and pads in restrooms exceeds the small cost that may be incurred to students.
Our University is always looking for new ways to make students happier and healthier on campus. Free concerts and luxurious gyms are much appreciated, but a simple way to make life easier for half the student body would be to stock tampons and pads in restrooms. It’s time to become more educated and realize that periods are normal and healthy, and perhaps more importantly, something that can be discussed freely. Hopefully in coming years, finding college restrooms stocked with these supplies will become the norm, and society’s unnecessary stigma surrounding periods will end. Until then, it is imperative that the student body continue to fight for women’s health and start a positive shift in their attitude toward menstruation and women’s health in general.
Female cycles are predictable.  Buy your tampons in advance of your need for them.
There is no such thing as a free lunch.  Nor free tampons.
Someone got paid to make them.  So the question is who pays for that and how?
If you want me to pay for something you use, which is what is implied here, the answer is no.
I’m paying for my daughter’s tampons now, and for her USC education.
That’s quite enough.  Isn’t your tuition high enough already?
Free tampons?  I did not know tampons cost nothing.  Sounds like free healthcare to me.

After overwhelmingly voting for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by a margin of almost 2-1, the Golden State has now become the Blue State. But in anticipation of a Trump presidency, California quickly organized itself and reassured its residents that it would be a bulwark against perceived threats to justice, opportunity and progress. For example, California has signaled to international leaders that it will take the lead on combating climate change despite Trump’s skepticism on the topic, and Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled plans to continue to reduce emissions in his inaugural address last year. More recently, the California legislature hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to advise the state in legal disputes with the Trump administration this month. 
The California government is therefore clearly braced to oppose the incoming president. Considering the absence of issues such as student debt in the Republican platform and President-elect Donald Trump’s stance against climate change, which almost half of millennials consider the top global challenge, it’s not surprising that only 37 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds cast their ballot for the President-elect. With so many millennials opposed to a Trump presidency, the question now becomes whether USC students will follow their state’s progressive lead and resist the harmful actions to which the incoming administration appears committed. Protests on USC’s campus have been scheduled for Inauguration Day, and while sit-ins and walkouts do have value, they are not enough. Pressure on elected officials cannot stop there or be isolated to the confines of the University. 
California’s already-progressive politics and its guarantee to protect these policies run the risk of discouraging the state millennials from joining the cause. It becomes easy to rely on state leaders to win these battles. But fighting against climate change and for equality requires more than just legislators or bureaucrats — it requires action from all of us.
Students should act on their political beliefs in their home states as well as on campus in order to make a difference. Such activism requires that students get involved in whatever capacity they can to advance progressive causes and enact positive change. When they graduate or are home on vacation, students can volunteer with local nonprofits, hold fundraisers for progressive causes, canvass for political campaigns, sign and share petitions, attend city council meetings and most importantly, vote in local, state and national elections.
The forces of complacency and diffusion of responsibility will be strong. In a country with so many people and problems, it becomes easy to distance oneself from politics and become disheartened and disengaged. But we’ve already seen the consequences of this attitude in the midterm elections in 2012, when only 46 percent of eligible millennials voted. We saw it again in 2016, when the millennial share of the vote shrank from 26 percent to 15 percent in Arizona.
 As America’s largest generation enters the workforce, millennials all hold a stake in the future of the United States. So let’s make a belated New Year’s resolution for ourselves and for our campus: Despite the leadership of California’s elected officials, we will resolve to continue to stand up for our rights, whether that be in our own backyard or across the country, and we will resist the temptation to sit down when progress stalls and our nation’s challenges seem too overwhelming.
 This presidency requires more than couch-side politics and posts on Facebook. Activism requires time, energy and dedication and will come with moments of hopelessness, pain and frustration. But the stakes are too high for us to stand on the sidelines.

Young adult franchises have maintained an ubiquitous presence in Hollywood for the last decade. Some series like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games have seen great success, while others have faltered due to their lack of originality, such as The Divergent Series and The Maze Runner).
Back in 2004, director Brad Silberling attempted to adapt the beloved children’s novels, A Series of Unfortunate Events, into a standalone film. His result was a polarizing feature that had fans of the books and general audiences butting heads in their opinions — the film was either great or horrid.
In 2017, the series has been rebooted into a miniseries (instead of a film) on Netflix. A Series of Unfortunate Events stars Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf, the eccentric criminal and primary antagonist attempting to steal the fortune of the recently orphaned Baudelaire children. 
The three Baudelaire children include inventor and the eldest Violet (Malina Weissman), bookworm Klaus (Louis Hynes) and adorably resourceful infant Sunny (Presley Smith). 
The first season follows the Baudelaire children as they discover that their parents have perished in a fire that burned down their home. A clueless banker, Mr. Poe, breaks the news to the children and takes them to their new guardian. Initially, the children are sent to live with Count Olaf, but soon after witnessing his terrible ways, are sent on a wild goose chase away from him as they seek a more suitable guardian. 
The season consists of eight episodes, adapting the first four novels that are split into two parts: The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, The Wide Window and The Miserable Mill. Lemony Snicket, a character within the novel played by Patrick Warburton, narrates the Baudelaires’ story throughout the season. 
Though his role in the overall plot of the series is unclear, it is suggested that Snicket plays a pivotal role in the future of the series. The innovative approach to adapting the novels works extremely well, and it may lay the groundwork for other series to be adapted in a similar way. 
The cinematography of the series sets it apart from other shows on Netflix. Filmed in a similar style to that of a Wes Anderson film, the series is able to maintain a gloomy, dark tone while capturing the dry humor of the novels. The source material provides a great opportunity for Harris, as his over-dramatic tendencies as an actor are fitting in the role of Count Olaf. 
The long list of guest stars consists of several A-list actors who have a lot of fun indulging in the ridiculous and illogical style of their characters, such as Joan Cusack, who portrays the outlandish Justice Strauss. One standout is Alfre Woodard as Aunt Josephine, a perpetually terrified woman to whom the Baudelaire children are sent in The Wide Window. Her performance is hilariously weird, bringing the masterful writing of the show to life.
The writing of the series is sharp and funny, with several pop culture references incorporated into the dialogue. It allows the cast members to easily mold into their roles. An interesting aspect of the series’ overall tone is how self-reflective and modern it is, adapting the series with updated references. 
At one point, Count Olaf claims entertainment is best consumed at home in a longform medium, suggesting the series should be binged in bed as opposed to in the theater. Another scene shows the youngest Baudelaire, Sunny, recommending the children take an Uber to their destination. Sunny is often the voice of reason in the show, pointing out the egregious logical fallacies of Mr. Poe and several of the other adult characters.    
The show succeeds because it remains faithful to the novels in tone and content. The humor is spot-on and extremely — though pleasantly — weird. The stupidity of the characters is always a treat, and while the Baudelaire children may be the least compelling aspect of the actual series, their misadventures are so fun and outrageous that it will leave audiences eager for a sophomore season. 
A Series of Unfortunate Events joins the list of many greats in the Netflix canon. Its absurdity and originality feel fresh, even though the source material is over a decade old. The show has already been renewed for a second season, which will adapt the next five novels into 10 episodes, and will likely conclude with a third season to adapt the remaining four books.
All eight episodes of the first season are available to be streamed on Netflix.

Bone-dry and painfully drawn out, HBO’s newest release The Young Pope would undoubtedly slip right into obscurity if not for one of the miniseries’ certain timely aspects. Starring the age-defying Jude Law as 47-year-old Lenny Belardo, the youngest and first American pope, the series thoughtfully imagines an alternate reality where the Vatican has been turned on its head. A new, cocky pope with no concern for the rules of the most dignified seat in Catholicism? What new fun … if only.
It is almost poetic that five days after the show’s premiere, President-elect Donald Trump, a narcissistic leader with no regard for the dignity of office, will take the highest seat in American government. Perhaps this timing was strategic, perhaps it wasn’t, but all in all it was very unfortunate. For as much as it entices with star power, Roman architecture and fascinating concept, The Young Pope just doesn’t push the envelope far enough. A sorry victim of its time, the miniseries simply cannot reckon with a reality in which every twist and turn puts its own drama to shame. 
Admittedly, even without today’s chilling political atmosphere, The Young Pope would not make for great drama anyway. Burdened with heavy monologues and dialogue about religion and tradition, The Young Pope should have used its technical and visual aspects to capture viewers’ attention. 
And yet, for a series so deftly plunging into a new world, The Young Pope falls rather flat. What could have been stunning juxtapositions of white and red robes, sweeping views of ancient Roman architecture and experimentation with camerawork simply fade into the same, yellowed shots again and again. Interrupted only by inexplicable swings and upside-down pans in cinematography, The Young Pope looks as boring as its conversations sound.
Despite one jolting homily at the beginning of the first episode, when Lenny advocates masturbation and abortion to a crowd gathered in St. Peter’s Basilica, The Young Pope doesn’t say too much that’s grossly irreverent or blasphemous, not to the extent that we would like. And when no one’s talking, there are prolonged silences -— too many of them. 
Perhaps in some films, silence can be as rich as a note of music, but here, there is not enough emotion built up or rolling away. And in moments of apparent excitement, as much as an edgy base layer of rock music wants to make us feel, The Young Pope does not excite. We hear the beat drop, but we don’t feel anything change.
Without giving away too many spoilers, the series (or at least the first episode) is heavy on the dream sequence, using this form to experiment and manipulate viewers’ expectations. And yet as fun as it is to shock and reveal, it is perhaps too soon in the series for this shtick. Viewers are still trying to figure out Lenny and his world. It feels unfair, belittling even, to be tricked over and over. And after all, beguiling your audience won’t be enough to keep them interested. It takes real, concocted drama, pent up and beating at the edges and spilling out. The Young Pope just doesn’t have it yet. 
Law plays an unreadable, arrogant young pope, handsome and appealing and yet unliked by those in his inner circle. Perhaps Lenny doesn’t care about this, but viewers still don’t know the reason for his disaccord with tradition. The cast is supplemented by a lovely yet out-of-place Diane Keaton, who plays Sister Mary, a nun brought back from Lenny’s childhood in an orphanage. 
Just like the sister, Lenny’s past still invokes his actions as priest, slipping under his skin like an annoying tick. Abandoned by his parents as a child, Lenny believes the world is a cold place, where the warmest relationship you can get is with God. But in figuring out what this has to do with his irreverent behavior, we are still left in the dark.
Two installments in, I still don’t know why Lenny is this way — callous, arrogant and wholly believing in the world’s selfishness. What is the root of his disrespect with the church? His character is a mystery, one that bores instead of enticing or intriguing me, and boredom is a high price to ask for viewers to tune in the next week. 
All these flaws are artistic ones, and yet the most damning is, of course, the context surrounding The Young Pope itself. Why would we turn to The Young Pope for rule-breaking and romanticized blasphemy when our own political dignity is being blasted in front of us? Truly, the present has made The Young Pope lose its edge, made it less a rumination of what-if-the-pope-was-Jude-Law than a meager attempt to measure up to a reality that already towers over it in drama and conflict.
The only difference between The Young Pope and reality is that in the real world, the stakes are unimaginably higher.

The xx, one of the most iconic indie pop bands of the 21st century, released their third album I See You last Friday. After four years of writing, recording and creating, the band finally released this new album, complementing their past songs with similar themes and lyrics while harnessing new and unexpected musical qualities. 
The xx has consistently set forth thought-provoking music that promotes extensive ponderance and reflection, and this album is no exception. In fact, I See You might be their most contemplative album yet. Exploring heavy topics like love, relationships, heartbreak, vulnerability, intimacy and infatuation, the band urges their listeners to think and challenge common conceptions of true connection while reflecting on past and present romantic ventures. 
One of the band’s most impressive qualities has been their ability to generate simple, yet wildly complex tracks, each carrying its own unique message. In I See You, the band continues to capture this striking quality, most notably with the opening track “Dangerous.” 
This track offers an interesting take on destructive relationships, youthful rebellion and self-worth. The upbeat rhythm coupled with themes centered on poor judgment starts the album with an edgy opening, a refreshing contrast from the band’s first two albums, XX and Coexist. This opening track indicates a shift from the band’s serene, mellow sound to a more bold, rhythmic quality, one that makes this album highly authentic.
The second song, “Say Something Loving” shifts to a more somber mood, exploring the nature of a fading love tainted by insecurity. The slower, less rhythmic nature of this song appropriately shifts the listener’s focus to a difficult topic, encouraging reflection on what so often extinguishes the spark in romantic relationships. 
However, the third track, “Lips,” virtually explores the exact opposite occurrence in relationships: intimacy and infatuation. In creating a sensual mood, the band uses this song to capture a more positive aspect of love and romance. The song touches on how all-consuming love can provide us with the confidence necessary to live wholeheartedly. 
After this sensual track, the album returns to a more upbeat mood with “A Violent Noise,” which touches on our reluctance to be vulnerable and embrace deep connections with others, both in friendship and romance. With the fifth track, “Performance,” however, the sound is once again based in somber tones and melodies, examining the idea that individuals tend to mask and suppress their true emotions for the sake of avoiding conflict, painful encounters and heartbreak. 
The second half of the album takes the listener on a similar rollercoaster of emotions and sound changes, as the band routinely alternates between solemn and rhythmic tones. In “Replica,” the band begins to incorporate elements that have been more commonly associated with their past albums. In this track, the lyrics are complemented by a dream-like, ethereal quality, one of the band’s trademarks. 
The tracks that follow ultimately build up to the final piece, which was particularly memorable. “Test Me” had few lyrics and little to no beat; however, the steady stream of a simple melody slowly escalated, mimicking the often slow but steady progression of romantic relationships. It allowed the listener time to ponder, to dream, to think without distracting melodies, beats or lyrics, which was the perfect way to end the album. 
Ultimately, this album is certainly a triumph for The xx, but also for fans of the indie pop genre. With these 10 new tracks, The xx have managed to once again intrigue its listeners with meaningful lyrics and a compelling sound.

 Vinyl and the 1960s era associated with it has struck a chord with young people across the board, leading to more and more youth purchasing physical LP records to supplement their digital consumption of music.
Vinyl has experienced a soulful revival, with popular retail stores like Urban Outfitters, Target and Best Buy selling record turntables at affordable prices. The Record Parlour hopes to provide vinyl enthusiasts, both old and young, with the ultimate opportunity to grow their music collections through a record giveaway this weekend. 
Opening its doors at 10:30 a.m., the Record Parlour will be giving away more than 35,000 records for free to the public this Saturday and Sunday. Guests will be able to sift through a plethora of boxes containing varying genres of LPs, ranging from classic rock to timeless soul. Located in Hollywood, the store will give away the records it has accumulated due to the increasingly popular vinyls.
The event occurs only twice a year as a means for the Hollywood music store to encourage customers to indulge their music consumption with this massive sale of LPs. After purchasing $20 worth of anything from the store, the Record Parlour will allow guests to take home up to 100 free records of their choice. There will be food trucks and drinks available on-site for a quick lunch break before digging back into the records. 
After its near disappearance in the early 2000s, the resurgence of vinyl has created a new hobby for the younger generation to grasp onto. A vital part of hipster culture, the record player offers s different avenue for millennial music listeners who grew up in the digital audio generation. Whether for an aesthetic Instagram post or a record collecting hobby, vinyl offers individuality for music fans. 
There is a novelty associated with displaying the physical LP and record player among other modern pieces in a room. 
Having a physical record in hand connects fans to the music beyond a digital device, since listeners can to insert themselves into the essence of a song through the placement of a needle. Indeed, the process associated with playing music from a record player goes beyond that of just a simple click or tap. It gives an organic feel that younger people may have been missing in a generation that lives in an increasingly technological age.
The Record Parlour provides all of the essentials as a hub for customers wanting to build their collection of retro gear. 
Open until 11:30 p.m. on weekdays, this shop transports the customer into a time period filled with jukeboxes and cassette tapes. With a never-ending supply of vintage records and memorabilia, there is something for all music lovers to enjoy and choose from.
The Record Parlour is located at 6408 Selma Ave. in Hollywood. Along with the free vinyls, the event will also be giving away free cassettes, music magazines and posters. The shop recommends those planning to attend to arrive early, as the event will be very popular on both Saturday and Sunday.

Photo courtesy of The Times of India
On New Year’s Eve in Bangalore – a city considered to be one of the most modern and cosmopolitan areas in India – photos and live footage of mass molestations of women were captured and publicized, attracting the attention of international news outlets. Despite a dispatch of a 1500-member police force to contain the incident, male crowds grew increasingly uncontrollable and sexually harassed and attacked what is estimated to be thousands of women who were on the streets of Bangalore that night. 
However, the official response to the molestations from the general public were overwhelmingly those of denial and victim-blaming, effectively highlighting the patriarchal and misogynistic undertones of the conservative perspectives of the older generation in power in India. To get a better idea of the context of the incident and the underlying causes, I spoke to my friend Shradha Jain, who is originally from Bangalore and was in the city on the night of New Year’s Eve.
DT: So give me your version of events.
SJ: So it was New Year’s Eve, and I had just landed from Rajasthan that day; we were going to another part of town so I wasn’t around the immediate area, but I heard about it the next afternoon when I woke up. I was devastated. I also had heard about it before at midnight on New Year’s Eve. I was calling my cousins to wish them Happy New Year, and all of them told me about how they drove past that area, and there were thousands and thousands of flip flops and just shoes lying around on the road, on the streets. It seemed like there had been a stampede or something and everyone’s shoes had been left there.
DT: What were the shoes from?
SJ: There were thousands of people there. Women were using the shoes to beat away the men who were trying to molest them. Since it was New Year’s, women were wearing heels, and they took their heels off to try and protect themselves and a lot of people just ran away without their shoes. In such a situation where you feel like you’re in danger and you have no immediate weapon on you, it’s common in India – even if a stray dog is attacking me in India, it would be a normal reaction to take off your shoes. In India, shoes are considered something very dirty, and so nobody would want to be touched by a shoe. Automatically, if you have a shoe in your hand, then the attacker’s going to back off. And so it’s used as a defense mechanism. I didn’t see what happened firsthand, I read about it in the newspapers the next morning.
DT: What happened afterwards?
SJ: There were a quite a lot of events in Bangalore afterward that encouraged women to stand up for themselves and protest what happened.  There were walks, rallies, conferences and a bunch of NGOs were doing a lot. Unfortunately, we didn’t get any help from the government.
DT: Right, and the minister of Karnakata said that it was because of the women’s Westernized dress.
SJ: He said that things like this were bound to happen if women were dressed in Westernized clothes, and obviously that statement has a lot of complexities in its roots. The fact that India was colonized by the British has left a lot of negativity and a lot of hate toward Western culture, and Western culture is seen as a threat to Indian conservatism, and so an immediate reaction for someone in his position given his background would be to say that the cause of the event was the fact that women were dressed in Western clothes. He wouldn’t want to blame the patriarchal Indian society because he is a man in a very high, powerful position in India. Even one of the ministers in Maharashtra, which is the state that Mumbai is in, said, “I wouldn’t want my daughter out on New Year’s Eve wearing short clothes if it wasn’t with her husband or her brother.” I guess that has a lot to say about the familial culture in India. I think that right now India’s in a position where there’s so many different complexities, primarily because of the exposure that the youth in India has gotten from the Internet.
DT: So there’s a clash between the older generation and the youth?
SJ: Exactly, the youth are being empowered to do what they want to do. I think the primary problem in India right now is that  — it’s like what happened in the United States, there’s echo chambers being created. So there are the liberal Indians who are promoting women empowerment and who are fighting for this cause, who are trying to increase safety for women, but then again they’re clustered in the same circles. They’re not trying to penetrate into communities that don’t believe in this. The problem is that that penetration isn’t happening unless you’re able to capitalize on local newspapers and local languages that are being distributed in rural areas in India. That’s where conservatism is primarily created and focused. Every single article that I read about the incident was in English, in a global newspaper. I mean, you’re fighting for a cause, but you’re fighting in the wrong marketplace, essentially.
DT: Were the mass molestations shocking to you at all or is this something that happens often?
SJ: I mean, the size of it  — I knew that there were going to be molestations on NYE, it happens every year —
DT: Does it? Why did this one make such a splash in the news, then?
SJ: Because of the size of it.
DT: What do you think is the underlying problem? Do you think in addition to the patriarchal culture, it’s because of the way that Indian boys are raised in the family?
SJ: I definitely think that it has a lot to do with the way that you’re raising your children. But I think more than that it’s the response that we have to such incidents. Right after this happened, my mom told me that I wasn’t allowed to go out to that area. I told her, “Mom, if you’re going to hide your daughters inside the house and be scared to send them out after these incidents, then the response is not to change the way you’re raising your sons, but to hide your daughters instead.” Having that response is not going to change anything. It’s like if we were to live in a community next to a mental asylum and 20 serial killers escape. Are you going to try and catch them and send them back? Or are you going to hide inside your homes instead? We should be saying, “Oh, our daughters should be free to do what they want, in a safe environment, so let’s create that safe environment.”
DT: Teach our boys to do better.
SJ: Exactly. Let’s raise our children differently, let’s make sure that boys do not feel as if they own the bodies of women. Let’s raise our children to believe that men and women are on equal standing.
DT: Do you think the most effective way to push an agenda for women empowerment would be state-sponsored, then?
SJ: I think that the government needs to step up. The prime minister of India has still not made an official statement after the incident.

The summer before the first semester of my freshman year, all I could think about was how excited I was to begin this new chapter in my life. Everyone had nothing but positive things to say about USC and Los Angeles, and it did not even cross my mind that I might have adjustment issues in college. After the excitement of the first few weeks of college wore off, anxiety and homesickness gripped me, and all I could think about was how much fun it looked like my friends were having at their various colleges via social media. I felt miserable, completely overwhelmed by my classes, trying to adjust to life in a new city and missing my hometown in the Midwest, and as though I had no niche in the large and diverse dynamic of USC’s student population. Scrolling through my Instagram feed, my friends seemed to have a plethora of close friends, and I wondered why I wasn’t having the same experiences as they were. While my friends were out at parties on a Friday night, I was trying to keep up with my reading for my 19th century literature class. I remember texting my best friend from high school, venting all of my issues I was having to her, and she told me she was going through the exact same thing. Then, I wondered to myself: Why did her life look so perfect on social media? 
Something I have learned in college is how unrealistic social media depicts one’s life. While this seems like an obvious statement, it was something that never really crossed my mind in high school: People do not want to be genuine with their lives on social media. In a sense, social media is an art form in which people compete to be perfect, and it is through likes that they gain this sense of validation. The positive feedback of likes perpetuates a negative cycle of trying to emulate this unrealistic image of yourself to your friends. I am guilty of doing the exact same thing on my own Instagram page, but the ironic thing is that I was blissfully unaware of it. And so was my best friend. It was my first semester of college when I really became aware of how my social media presence could be so toxic because of how much it negatively affected my mental health. It is so easy to take what is on social media seriously, but it was my first semester of college when I took a step back and realized that what I see on Instagram does not capture a person’s true emotions or quality of life. 
Ever since this interaction with my best friend, I have made more of an effort to be more genuine on social media and turn my presence into something to which people can actually relate. I have also learned not to take everything so seriously, and I now understand that I am not the only one having a rough time figuring college out even if it seems like I am on a superficial level. All in all, I have learned that perfection is unattainable, and the way to find true happiness in times of instability or crisis is to take a deep breath and accept that things will improve with time. Freshman year of college can be a mess in a lot of ways, but my advice to everyone is to remember that it is okay not to be okay during this transitional period in our lives.
