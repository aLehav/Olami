With an impending matchup against No. 4 Stanford on Thursday, the USC Women of Troy had hoped to carry a three-game winning streak into the clash in Palo Alto.
However, a 67-61 loss to Washington halted the Women of Troy as they fell to sixth place in a tight Pac-12 conference at the Galen Center on Sunday.
The Huskies (12-9, 4-6) held a one-point lead entering the final minute before capitalizing on five free throws and a second-chance layup while holding USC (12-10, 6-5) scoreless for 40 seconds.
USC senior guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath both drained 3-pointers in the final 16 seconds, but Washington sank another four free throws to guarantee the victory and snap USC’s two-game winning streak.
Guard Jazmine Davis led a trio of Huskies in double-digits with a game-high 26 points.
USC, on the other hand, had four Women of Troy in double-digits. Corral headed the team with a 19-point performance alongside a double-double by sophomore forward Cassie Harberts, who had 12 points and 11 rebounds.
Despite the healthy balance of scoring, a stuttering late offense and porous defense allowed Washington to pull away with the victory.
“We just weren’t executing our defense,” Corral said. “I think we killed ourselves tonight.”
Midway through the second half, Corral led an 8-0 USC run with two 3-pointers, followed by an alley-oop pass to Gilbreath, who finished to give USC a nine-point advantage with 12:12 remaining.
But for the next ten minutes, USC scored only four points while the Huskies responded with 18, and the Women of Troy fell behind by five with two minutes remaining.
“We have to develop that killer instinct, and until we get that, we’ll have games like this where we’re in them, and then we lose them down the stretch,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. 
In the beginning of the game, USC had jumped out to a 9-0 lead with jumpers by three different players, but Washington quickly whittled the lead with 18 first-half points by Davis.
After the Huskies briefly pulled ahead 21-20, sophomore forward Desireé Bradley scored eight consecutive points in less than two minutes to give USC a 28-24 lead.
In the first half, the Women of Troy shot 46 percent behind Harberts’ 10 points. Both sides drained 5-for-10 from behind the arc in the first 20 minutes.
However, USC’s shooting percentage dipped to 24 percent in the second half, with Harberts adding only two more points to her total in the latter 20 minutes.
“We always come in a game with the mentality to get inside, and I didn’t get my team the presence that it needed,” Harberts said.
The team hopes to rebound in their next matchup against the formidable Stanford Cardinal, who have yet to lose a conference game.
“Stanford’s not going to come in and play lightly,” Corral said. “Everybody on this team has to show up, and against Stanford we just have to be ready.”
USC will face off against the Cardinal in Palo Alto at 6 p.m. on Thursday.

Journalist Christiane Amanpour will address USC’s graduating class as the 2012 commencement speaker on May 11, the Daily Trojan has learned. The speech will take place in Alumni Park.
Amanpour serves as the chief international correspondent for CNN International and the global affairs anchor for ABC News. This spring she will begin hosting Amanpour, an interview television program on CNN.

Judy Muller, a professor of journalism at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and a former ABC News correspondent, said Amanpour has distinguished herself with her overseas reporting.
“[Amanpour is] a terrific choice — I was happy to see it,” Muller said. “We’ve had male broadcast journalists before, but it’s wonderful to see a woman broadcaster who has such extensive experience as an overseas correspondent, as a war correspondent and as a leader.”
Amanpour, who spoke at Harvard University in 2010, first gained prominence when she reported on the Persian Gulf War as an international correspondent for CNN in 1990. Since then, she has covered war, famine, genocide and natural disasters.
Rachel Israel, a senior majoring in business administration, said she is excited to have someone so well known speaking at commencement.
“All that I expect from a university commencement ceremony is to see that the school is large enough or influential enough to get someone who will impress the people in attendance,” Israel said. “Christiane Amanpour is an impressive public figure, making it a bit more worth it to wake up for such an early ceremony.”
Amanpour was the first international correspondent to interview Tony Blair, then-British prime minister; Jacques Chirac, then-French president; and Pervez Musharraf, then-Pakistani president, after Sept. 11.
Her accolades include an inaugural Television Academy Award, nine News and Documentary Emmys and four George Foster Peabody Awards.
Amanpour is also noted for her exclusive interviews with world leaders, such as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the presidents of Afghanistan, Sudan and Syria, and the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. She secured the only interview with former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and an exclusive with the late Col. Moammar Ghadafi of Libya.
Though most Annenberg students are familiar with Amanpour, not all graduating seniors are exhibiting the same enthusiasm.
Andrew Ramirez, a senior majoring in English, said he did not recognize Amanpour’s name, but he is sure she will be an interesting keynote speaker.
“I have no idea who she is,” Ramirez said. “But [her speaking] will introduce a lot of people to who she is.”
Past USC commencement speakers include Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, former USC President Steven B. Sample and former Calif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Amanpour will be the first female commencement speaker at USC since 2003.
Laura Escobar-Vallecillo, a senior majoring in communication, said she was happy USC picked a female commencement speaker.
There have been two female speakers since 1983, not including Amanpour. Judge Dorothy Nelson of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals addressed USC’s graduating class of 1983 and Brown University President Ruth Simmons addressed the graduating class of 2003.
“That just proves that the times are changing,” Escobar-Vallecillo said.
It’s a relief to see that SC has Amanpour as a speaker this year. I’m sick of “rockstar cool” speakers at ceremonies. It’s not the MTV image awards, you know?! The American university culture is at an all time low when they pay $30,000 to people like Snookie to speak; yeah, some school really did last year. I don’t giva efff what that bimbo’s got on her mind; she’s a waste.
@USC Parent
Get your facts straight. ZBT had nothing to do with the “email situation”  you’re referencing. It was Kappa Sigma, and completely blown out of proportion.
I may have my fraternity wrong and if so I apologize for any confusion.  I thought Kappa Sig was the two on the roof that made news around the World
The male on the roof was a Kappa Sig, but I also think the girl had a choice over whether or not to go up there with him….
You have no idea if she had choice to go on the roof with the frat boy.   It looked like an act of violence to me and my friends.
This is truly an honor for USC and our graduating class of 2012 of which my daughter is a member.   I am hopeful Ms. Amanpour will discuss the many issues facing women in the workplace and in society in general.  As part of the difficulties facing women, I wonder if she will discuss that whole ZBT email situation from last year as an example of how our male driven society mistreats women.

Before Ostrow School of Dentistry’s Give Kids a Smile Day on Friday, Jessica Garcia had never been to the dentist.
“They were nice,” said Garcia, 5, a kindergarten student at the James A. Foshay Learning Center. “It was fun and they counted my teeth.”

“I have 20 teeth!” said classmate Dajah Nicholson, 5, a kindergarten student at Foshay, “And I learned it’s important to brush your teeth.”
The Ostrow School of Dentistry brought two mobile vans to the Foshay Learning Center, a K-12 school one mile west of the University Park Campus, to give elementary school-aged children dental screenings Friday.
Students who returned parental consent forms were brought classroom-by-classroom onto the physical education field. After meeting the dental hygienists, one of whom was dressed as the tooth fairy, students were taken into vans equipped with dental chairs and implements for their screenings.
The screening allowed hygienists to determine whether students were eligible to receive sealants, thin plastic coverings applied to molars to prevent tooth decay, according to Linda Brookman, co-director of the Neighborhood Mobile Dental Van Prevention Program.
“The focus of our program is largely on prevention,” Brookman said. “By providing screenings and eventually sealants, we are trying to stem the tide of dental disease.”
The USC mobile vans will return in the coming months to apply sealants to eligible students. Some families also received $100 vouchers for dental care at the Ostrow School of Dentistry, said Roseann Mulligan, chair of Dental Public Health and Pediatric Dentistry.
“The need is so great,” Mulligan said. “Cavities are truly an epidemic in L.A. County and the lower-income population of the United States.”
Mulligan said about 73 percent of children in L.A. County have insufficient dental care.
Dean of the Ostrow School of Dentistry Avishai Sadan said the implications of this event and pediatric dental care go far beyond nice smiles.
“When kids are in pain from toothaches and infections, the deck is stacked against them,” Sadan said. “Some people forget that your mouth is part of your head, but we know the impact we can make on the community and we ensure it remains a priority. We believe it’s the right thing to do.”
While 100 students received screenings, more than 600 students received oral hygiene instruction in a nearby classroom. Classes were brought in one at a time and received a short lesson on proper dental care from Dr. Julie Jenks, a professor of hygiene.
“I want to get them enthused so they can see what they themselves can do to take care of their teeth,” Jenks said.
Jenks said this includes choosing healthy snacks, chewing sugarless gum and rinsing after eating.
Christopher Chan, a third-year dental student, dressed as a molar and taught the Foshay students how to brush their teeth with a five-foot long toothbrush.
“This is my first time dressing-up as a molar, but I believe the dental school has prepared me well,” Chan said. “I do like the fact that USC is involved with the community, though. It’s a lot of fun and really creates positive change.”
Farnaz Jahangiri, a junior majoring in dental hygiene, said this was one of the first times she had the opportunity to serve the community through dentistry.
“This is one of the best experiences I have ever had,” Jahangiri said, “I’ve never worked with kids before, but they are really trying to cooperate.”
The dental hygiene students comprised most of the work force, according to the Chair of the Dental Hygiene Program.
This is the 10th year USC participated in the American Dental Association’s Give Kids a Smile Day; is one of the Ostrow School of Dentistry’s many community outreach initiatives.
To ensure that students apply what they learned in school to their home lives, each student received a bag with dental supplies (toothbrush, toothpaste and floss), toys and an instruction sheet. Students who were screened were able to choose a new book from a selection donated by the Ella Fitzgerald Foundation.
“I’m feeling good and happy because I’m going to the dentist,” said Brian Beltran, 6. “I learned that teeth are important because you use them when you eat and when you smile.”
It is really nice to hear about the service the dental school provided to the kids and along with they have educated about the importance of maintaining a good oral health. It is really good to teach the kids from the beginning to take care of their oral cavity. It will not only help the kids to have a healthy teeth but to have a strong teeth and gums. I really have to thank you for sharing this information with everyone…..
After all this free stuff, maybe they stop stealing my bikes?

Undergraduate Student Government and USC Hospitality launched a reusable mug program in a joint effort to promote sustainability on campus Monday. The launch ends USG’s three-year effort to develop a sustainable mug.
The mug can be purchased at nine different USC Hospitality locations. Students will receive a free cup of coffee with their mug purchase and a 25-cent discount on every subsequent purchase when using the mug. The discount applies to any small drip coffee, espresso, tea or fountain drink. The mugs will cost $7.99.
“We wanted to make sure the mug wasn’t too high-priced, so we set our goal to make sure it was under $10 and we can happily say it’s $7.99,” said Mikey Geragos, USG director of university affairs. “We think that was the biggest hurdle.”
Rohan Mehra, assistant USG director for university affairs, said if the mugs sell quickly USG plans to work with the Office of Sustainability to make the mug more environmentally friendly.
“We are going to work with the Office of Sustainability to source an actual mug made out of recyclable materials because, as of right now, it’s just a regular plastic mug,” he said.
Geragos said there are currently 500 mugs in stock, but USG will purchase more depending on whether the mugs sell quickly.
“If we run out of the 500 and we do so in a reasonable time … we are definitely going to be looking at more mugs to purchase,” Geragos said.
The sustainability mug project was first conceived three years ago by now-USG treasurer, Elton Kwok.
“[One] reason it took so long was this is the first real joint-venture between hospitality and student government in terms of creating a product to sell,” Geragos said. “Creating that relationship and then also being able to work between both departments, I think was the biggest struggle.”
USG now has a positive working relationship with hospitality, which Geragos said will allow them to accomplish future projects more quickly.
“Now I feel confident that if we wanted to do another one like this, it would be less than half the time,” Geragos said. “It would be much quicker, much smoother.”
Though Geragos said his committee had not received much student feedback before the launch, he said students feel the mug will increase sustainability.
“Students, as a whole, don’t know a lot about it yet,” Geragos said. “But [from] everyone I’ve talked to, what they are mainly excited about is that they are going to see the direct effort USG is placing in sustainability and moving to create a more green campus.”
Why don’t they just give out those plastic red cups with a paper liner?  Those are really inexpensive at Costco or Smart&Final
Lets do the math…
7.99 plus tax = $8.64/ $0.25 = 34.56
You need to purchase 35 cups of coffee to break even.
Most places call that a rip-off
Oh but we are saving the planet, right?

Daniel Radcliffe warned fans before watching his new movie The Woman in Black at the Los Angeles premiere: “I hope you enjoy screaming, or if not, I hope you enjoy laughing at other people screaming.”
True to his words, this British horror film will leave you terrified.
Bye bye Harry · Daniel Radcliffe commands the audience’s attention as he portrays complex emotions alone on camera, proving he has the talent, drive and maturity to hold his own outside Harry Potter. - Photo courtesy of CBS Films
Based on a novel and play adaptation of the same title, The Woman in Black gives audiences a taste of a classic British horror story. After an old widow dies alone in her isolated home on the marshes, a solicitor named Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) is sent out from London to assess the mountain of documents she left behind.
Upon arriving in the village, Kipps discovers grief-stricken, superstitious townspeople, most of whom are unwilling to even transport him to the widow’s home: Eel Marsh House. After seeing the shadow of a woman lurking about the house and witnessing the deaths of several children in the town, Kipps begins to realize there is something evil living in the house on the marshes.
The Woman in Black portrays a classic ghost story and a classic style of horror genre filmmaking. Instead of the bloody gore and violence seen in most blockbuster horror films today, The Woman in Black relies more on mysterious off-screen noises and slowly creeping shadows to keep viewers on edge. A rocking chair moving on its own, a plethora of noisy and disturbing children’s toys and ever-present lurking phantoms not only shock the audience, but also keep them in a state of suspense throughout the film.
That is not to say that The Woman in Black is easy to handle for those with an aversion to graphic content. On the contrary, there are moments in the film that will inspire many viewers to cover their eyes.
The disturbing deaths of children who are shown coughing up blood or even burning alive are scattered throughout the film. Images of muddy, grotesque figures crawling from the marshes and the gaunt white faces of the dead will haunt viewers long after the film has ended.
Though the film begins and sometimes moves slowly in terms of story progression, the slow pace helps amplify the tension and is actually more beneficial than detrimental. Long, lingering takes effectively serve to keep audience members on the edge of their seats, guessing what’s coming next.
The camera is precisely placed and moved during many shots to highlight ominous spaces as well as the often-moving shadows obscured in the backgrounds of the scenes. The cinematography is critical to this film: One of the most suspenseful scenes in the entire movie involves the camera giving the audience a unique perspective, letting it see through the eyes of the woman in black herself as she ever-so-slowly inches toward the back of Kipps’ sleeping form.
For Radcliffe, this film introduces him to the world as more than the actor at the core of the Harry Potter series. The fact that viewers won’t spend the entire film seeing Radcliffe as the young wizard they have come to cherish is a testament to the lead actor’s growth, especially considering how much time he spends alone onscreen.
Almost a third of the film is spent with Radcliffe in the dark corners of Eel Marsh House, and his performance is compelling enough to carry it. Radcliffe effectively portrays the complicated emotions of a father and a widower, battling inner and external demons with skill.
Though many ghost stories tend to end with some sort of resolution, The Woman in Black offers viewers no such comfort. Though the main characters work tirelessly to bring the tormented woman to peace, the audience leaves the theater with the same tension felt throughout the film.
The Woman in Black is a refreshing example of old-school horror — a style not based on gore but on genuine terror and suspense. With an outstanding performance by Daniel Radcliffe, this movie is perfect, as the actor said, for those who love to scream.
The Woman in Black will leave viewers haunted, confronting shadows in the safety of their own homes.

Certain figures’ legacies have survived decades of new movies, new hit songs and new famous faces, remaining bona fide icons whose fame continues today despite the passage of time: Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Jimi Hendrix and Mick Jagger.
These names and others have managed to stay in the pop culture dialogue. For many Angelenos, the city serves as a glimpse into iconic artists’ pasts and hopefully famous faces from the present.
But just because Los Angeles is known for famous faces doesn’t mean that you have to hit the streets of Hollywood for celebrity history. This notion is particularly true at The Vault, a gallery locale that will serve as a trip down memory lane for some and a rare look into past eras for others. Either way, the average visitor can’t help but recognize the faces gracing the walls of the gallery, whether it be that of Monroe or Hendrix.
Located on Culver City’s gallery row, The Vault boasts unique 1950s and 1960s photographs of familiar figures. The gallery was originally located in Beverly Hills as The Celebrity Vault but was moved to Culver City last year under its changed name. The gallery acquires rare photographs from sources like art dealers and private collections.
The Vault distinguishes itself not only because it houses photographs featuring prominent figures, but because it also displays the work of important photographers, including sports photographer Frank Worth.
Though a sports photographer, Worth managed to snap photographs of people like Alfred Hitchcock at the premiere of Rear Window, Rita Hayworth taking in some sun and James Dean using the bathroom with his back turned to the camera. In fact, the gallery has quite a unique collection of Worth’s works.
“Frank Worth never published these photos for ethical reasons,” said gallery assistant Randell Baltazar as he held up a stunning black-and-white photograph of Elizabeth Taylor. “He passed away in 2001, and the company bought the right to the photographs. It found hundreds of undeveloped rolls of film. Some [of the subjects] are alive and some aren’t.”
The particular photograph Baltazar held came from the set of the 1956 movie Giant, which starred Taylor, Rock Hudson and Dean. Few photographers were allowed on set, which makes these photographs all the more prized. The shots display a behind-the-scenes look at the movie atmosphere of a by gone era and an intimate look at the glamorous yet candid characteristics that made these celebrities famous.
“There’s always continuing interest in this work. People adore Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe,” Baltazar said.
When the photographer catches an artist or actor outside of his environment, the portraits become even more endearing. Gered Mankowitz’s photographs, for example, cast iconic figures in a more human light.
Taken away from the stage and his guitar, Hendrix poses for the photographer in a series of close-up shots. One of them, aptly titled “Jimi Hendrix, Smoking,” shows Hendrix puffing out cigarette smoke with the hint of a smile across his face. The black-and-white picture manages to capture a unique moment; here Hendrix might only be exhaling cigarette smoke, but he’s also staring directly at the camera with a distinct look in his eye, stripped of flashy objects — save for his fashionable jacket and iconic face. Mankowitz’s work also includes captivating photos of the Rolling Stones.
Iconic photographs like these draw heavy interest from visitors at The Vault.
“People come in who are big fans and ask, ‘Can I see your Jimi Hendrix photos?’ And ‘Tell me how much they are,’” Baltazar said.
Douglas Kirkland’s photographs also highlight the individual personalities of iconic artists.“ Audrey Hepburn, Paris 1965” shows the actress in a white jacket and hat, playfully holding a pair of white sunglasses between her teeth. The photograph displays the right amount of candid and staged. Hepburn wears a little makeup, but the pose seems natural — a funny gesture that shows the artist’s personality. Viewers see the starlet and her familiar features but also traces of the girl that exists when the cameras aren’t on her.
The photographs eventually find homes in a variety of places since the gallery not only caters to photography connoisseurs, but also interior designers and hotels.
“We also have fine art works, so we do a lot of things. We’re pretty liberal,” Baltazar said.
Walking around The Vault, visitors will take in everything from glamorous photographs to simple snapshots. The collection proves an impressive homage to an era that produced many important stars and serves as a quieter, more insightful alternative to the streets of Hollywood.
 
The Vault is located on 6150 Washington Blvd.

“You wouldn’t steal a car … Piracy, it’s a crime!”
Many people will remember this quote from an anti-piracy ad that appeared in 2004 in theaters and on countless DVDs.
Ironically, though most college students probably wouldn’t shoplift a CD from a store, many do pirate albums and feel no shame about it.
As sales in the music industry continue to slip, it is becoming increasingly easier for people to instantly find the music they want to for free through direct-download sites, such as Mediafire and Hulkshare, or through legal streaming platforms, such as Soundcloud and Spotify.
Electronic/dubstep artist Skrillex told his fans in January via Facebook they should pirate his latest EP if they can’t afford to buy it. Though he isn’t the first artist to endorse pirating or to claim to be indifferent to record sales, fans did respond to this with wide support. Many, in fact, claimed that they would pay for his album because of the bold statement he made.
In the past, artists like Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails have released albums with “pay-your-own-price” options and have faced mixed success. Radiohead’s spokesman Murray Chalmers stated that most fans paid around retail price for the album, In Rainbows, despite having the option of paying nothing.
As for Nine Inch Nails’ release of The Slip with a “pay-your-own-price” model, creator Trent Reznor told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in Dec. 2008 it “didn’t feel like an overwhelming success.”
There is a difference, however, between Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails offering their albums for free and Skrillex telling his fans to download his album for free. Though Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails released their albums independently, Skrillex released his Bangarang EP on a major label.
In this example, it means that the resulting sales profits that aren’t going to Skrillex also aren’t going to the studio engineers, marketers, promoters and label executives who own the rights to the album. Though Skrillex might gain fan support by empathizing with his fan’s financial constraints, everyone else involved in the recording of the album is missing out.
To combat the impact that piracy has, the U.S. Congress proposed the Stop Online Piracy Act, a controversial House bill supported by the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America. The bill gained controversy and criticism, and on Jan. 14, the White House released a statement saying it will not support SOPA in its current form; SOPA has since been indefinitely postponed in Congress.
But another question arises: Is piracy really to blame for the music industry’s struggles?
Paul Young, a professor of music industry at the Thornton School of Music, doesn’t think so. Though he believes that piracy is one component in the downfall of the music industry, he also contends that the increasing popularity of music streaming, as well as the music industry’s struggle to adapt to new distribution methods, are to blame.
“Streaming is based on ad money or subscription dollars. Neither one of them are pacing close to where sales were, but [streaming] also cannibalizes sales,” Young says.
When consumers can listen to Skrillex on Spotify or YouTube for free, pirating seems to become a secondary issue. According to a 2011 Nielsen report, 57 percent of Internet users access YouTube to stream music, compared to 35 percent who download music illegally, and 17 percent who download music legally.
Copyright issues get much more confusing when it comes to the increasing popularity of electronic music, which is often heavily dependent on sampling and mashups.
When artists such as Girl Talk — who samples other musicians’ works — release their mashups for free, the question of ownership becomes cloudy.
Aria Soroudi, a USC senior who also DJs under the moniker Three Beats Deep, defends the use of sampling in modern music.
“Even though we don’t make all of the music we play, we help spread it around and make it popular,” Soroudi says.
But Young contends that the issue is less innocuous when bigger artists use sampling for their own gains.
“The problem is with electronic artists like Girl Talk or, before he died, DJ AM, [who]can go and do a show for $20-$50,000; What does [that money] do for the guy that’s singing on the track?” Young says. “What [audiences] want now is an artist’s remix as a product. You may go through Soundcloud, a torrent site or that artist’s site, but you want the new version.”
The issue of music piracy and free music continues to be divisive among music lovers and artists, but one that contains more complexity than simply “stealing is wrong.” Skrillex understands that not all his fans can afford his music, but he isn’t the only one missing out when his album is downloaded.
“I want there to be a profession for the musicians who create content. Sometimes the creator is the person who paid for it — that means a label,” Young says.  “Somebody went to them for money to make the music they want to make, so everyone in that chain deserves something.”

The No. 4 USC Trojans men’s volleyball team was swept at home by No. 3 UCLA Friday night by scores of 27-25, 25-15 and 25-23.
The Bruins (11-1, 6-0) beat the Trojans (5-4, 4-4) behind a steady diet of strong serves, blocks and defense that derailed the Trojans’ offense.
“They served us out of system and made our offense predictable,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “Every time we took a swing from the power side, they had three blockers on us.”
Served · Despite their lofty ranking, the No. 4 Trojans were no match for the No. 3 Bruins Friday night. They were swept in three sets. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Bruins finished with 15.5 blocks to the Trojans’ 7.5. Almost every Trojan attack was met with a solid wall of blockers, taking away the power shots and forcing easy tips, rolls and dunks. The Trojan offense hit .103 on the day, the lowest percentage this season.
The Trojans’ individual hitting numbers illustrated the effectivness of the Bruin block. Redshirt sophomore opposite Tanner Jansen finished with a game-high 12 kills but also committed seven errors, resulting in a .179 hitting percentage. Jansen’s percentage, however, was the best Trojan total for the day. The senior duo of captains, 2011 All-MPSF honorees Tony Ciarelli and Steven Shandrick ,were the focus of the Bruin block all night and finished with hitting percentages of .029 and .000 respectively.
The first set was teeming with energy from both sides and went to extra points. Though the Trojans were out-hit .294 to .194, the set was competitive from start to finish.
“The first game was dog-eat-dog,” Ferguson said. “We had a couple of swings that could have gotten us back into it, but they just didn’t work.”
Things got worse from there. The Trojans had as many errors as kills, resulting in a .000 hitting percentage. On the other side, the Bruins became efficient and forceful, finishing the set hitting at a .450 clip.
“Our guys got frustrated in the second set and we got away from our game plan,” Ferguson said. “The second set was the one set that we didn’t do well in.”
The Trojans showed life in the third set when they went on an 8-3 scoring run to tie the game at 19-19. The run included two straight blocks from senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick.
“Our guys showed a lot of resolve and fight during that stretch,” Ferguson said. “But things just fell short.”
When asked about what to learn from this match, senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli was brief.
“We didn’t play well. We didn’t hit well,” Ciarelli said. “All we can learn is to never play like that again.”

The USC women’s track and field team arrived in New York on Friday, ready to compete in the New Balance Collegiate Invitational. The event at The Armory is one the largest indoor meets of the season, bringing in top-25 teams including Lousiana State University and Arkansas.
Despite being ranked 109th by the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association, the women’s team sought to carry over a strong performance from its latest meet at the Run For The Dream event, three weeks prior.
During the two-day Run For the Dream event in Fresno, Calif. the team broke several meet records and posted seven wins. The event, Jan. 20-21, was the first indoor meet of the season. Sophomore Lauren Blackburn competed in the 55-meter hurdle, breaking the record twice and posting a final overall time of 7.83 seconds. Sophomores Jessica Davis and Loudia Laarman also ran record-breaking times in the 55-meter dash, although Davis would go on to match Laarman’s time in the final heat for the win.
Senior Anniya Louis ran a winning time of 2:19.06 in the 800-meter. Freshmen Erin Robinson and Vanessa Jones both won in their events, the 3000-meter and 600-yard dash respectively.
Additionally, the relay team won in the 4×145-meter and 4×400-meter relay, breaking a meet record in the former. Though these were big wins for the women’s indoor track and field team, the Women of Troy’s skill would be put to the test during the New Balance Collegiate Invitational.
At the New Balance Collegiate Invitational, the team finished 18th. Despite a strong start to the season, sophomore Alitta Boyd would be the only USC athlete to win any of the championship events, posting a 6.33-meter jump to win women’s long jump. Davis would finish sixth in the women’s 200-meter dash and senior Dalilah Muhammad finishing eighth in the 60-meter hurdle.
These rankings should not be taken out of context; the competition at a national event such as the New Balance Collegiate Invitational is far superior to the competition at a smaller meet such as Run For The Dream.
Despite competition from some of the country’s best teams, the USC women’s track and field team gave a strong performance at this year’s New Balance Collegiate Invitational and will look to build upon the showing on Friday at the Texas A&M Indoor Challenge.

A two-game road trip against top tennis programs in Northern California could not deter USC men’s tennis from its streaking start to the spring season.
With a 7-0 sweep over No. 6 Stanford (4-2) last Friday and a 5-2 victory over No. 13 California (3-2) a day later, No. 1 USC (6-0) extended its win streak to 25 matches, which spans from last season’s championship run.
Aces · Senior Daniel Nguyen has won three national championships during his tenure at USC. The Trojans defeated Cal Saturday 5-2. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
For the third time this season, USC freshman Roberto Quiroz guaranteed the Trojans’ victory with a 6-2, 7-5 win over Cal’s Ahmed Ismail on court six.
Before Quiroz notched USC’s fourth point, senior Steve Johnson and No. 48 sophomore Emilio Gomez dispatched their singles opponents in straight sets. On court three, No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen tallied USC’s final point with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Christoffer Konigsfeldt.
USC sophomore Ray Sarmiento and freshman Yannick Hanfmann, ranked No. 12 and No. 33, respectively, both took their first singles losses this season for Cal’s two points of the match.
The Trojans took a 1-0 lead after doubles action with an 8-3 victory by Johnson and Hanfmann over Konigsfeldt and Nick Andrews, a pair ranked No. 5 in ITA rankings.
That came after the team of Quiroz and No. 48 sophomore Emilio Gomez captured USC’s first doubles win in an 8-1 decision over Riki McLachlan and Tommie Murphy.
“I think it was really tough to come and play against their crowd, but the team did great and stepped it up,” Gomez said.
The day before, USC took on the Cardinal at Stanford’s Taube Stadium, where the Trojans had clinched their third consecutive NCAA championship last May.
After Sarmiento took down No. 75 Matt Kandath 6-3, 6-1 and Gomez defeated John Morrissey 6-2, 6-2, Hanfmann locked up the Trojans’ win with a 6-3, 6-2 victory against Robert Stineman.
Two narrow wins by Johnson and Quiroz along with a straight set victory by Nguyen rounded out USC’s fourth sweep of the season.
Gomez and Quiroz began the day with an 8-2 doubles win over Stineman and Walker Kehrer, followed by a victory by Hanfmann and Johnson that notched the Trojans’ first point of the match.
A return to the site of their third NCAA championship meant more to the Trojans than just another potential win to add to their longstanding streak.
“There were definitely a lot of good memories,” Nguyen said. “We brought up a lot of jokes, we went to the same restaurants. It was really good being back.”
The perfect two-game road trip did not affect USC’s Pac-12 record, but it did give the Trojans a chance to play their stiffest dual match competition so far this season.
“We knew that both teams were going to be really tough, and we really tried to play 100 percent,” Nguyen said. “We didn’t want to let anything go. I think the guys really did that well.”
USC will have several days of rest before facing No. 12 Pepperdine (3-1) on Friday at 1 p.m. in Malibu.

If you’re wondering what got into the Pac-12 this February, believe me, you’re not the only one. Of Rivals.com’s top-25 recruiting classes, six of them came from schools from the “conference of champions.” Sure, the Pac-12 has historically performed admirably when it comes to national signing day, but 2012 certainly looked like its best year in recent memory.
UCLA, which went 6-8 a season ago and fired coach Rick Neuheisel, signed 26 players, nine of whom ranked as four- and five star players. Stanford signed a consensus top-10 class. And USC, despite scholarship limitations which capped its class at 15, managed to sign the No. 8 class, according to Rivals.com. Though spring practices are still at least a month away, national signing day provided a few glimpses into the future of the conference and USC.
Here are five things we learned from last week’s recruiting circus.
1. Tosh Lupoi’s departure to Washington was felt up and down the coast
Perhaps no signing was more important — recruiting-wise — this offseason than the deal former California defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator Lupoi inked with Washington in January, worth a reported $416,000 per year. Before his departure, Cal was on track to reel in a top-10 class, but several previous commits ended up elsewhere and the Golden Bears stumbled. Five-star safety prospect and once-Cal commit Shaq Thompson of Sacramento, Calif., followed Lupoi to Washington. Others, such as five-star defensive end Ellis McCarthy of Monrovia, Calif., and four-star wide receiver Jordan Payton of Westlake Village, Calif., — who were both Cal commits at some point — ended up at UCLA. And Oregon landed four-star defensive end Arik Armstead of Elk Grove, Calif., who had been considering Cal. Despite cold feet from some, coach Jeff Tedford and the Golden Bears still managed to sign a top-25 class.
2. Roster management remains critical in Southern California
How the L.A. schools handle their scholarship allocations in the coming months will be a rather interesting development to follow.
As has been well-documented, USC, because of sanctions, cannot carry more than 75 scholarship players when fall camp begins in August. Though USC coach Lane Kiffin has declined to reveal how many players the Trojans are carrying at the moment, Wednesday’s 12 signees do appear to move the magic number to 77, which does not include senior defensive end Armond Armstead. So at some point, Kiffin and company will have to either see two players transfer or take away two scholarships to get to 75.
Oddly enough, Kiffin’s counterpart across town, UCLA coach Jim Mora, will also need to do some roster dwindling of his own. Before signing day, UCLA had 68 scholarship players on its roster, as noted by Los Angeles Times UCLA beat writer Chris Foster. But by signing a class of 26, it would appear as if UCLA now has 94 scholarship players. Teams are allowed to carry just 85 scholarship players, so somehow the Bruins must cut nine guys loose.
3. Stanford coach David Shaw can recruit 
Following Jim Harbaugh’s departure to the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, the overwhelming notion has been that Stanford is headed toward some sort of a drop-off, especially with the graduation of quarterback Andrew Luck. That no longer seems to be a foregone conclusion. Under Shaw, the Cardinal signed a consensus top-10 class, according to multiple recruiting services, and the No. 5 class per Rivals.com. Shaw went toe-to-toe with Kiffin and USC and came out a winner, too. Five-star offensive tackle Kyle Murphy of San Clemente, Calif., five-star offensive tackle Andrus Peat of Tempe, Ariz., and five-star defensive end Aziz Shittu of Atwater, Calif., all signed with Stanford. Typically, the Trojans have had to fend off Cal, Oregon or UCLA for local prospects, but based on this year, it’ll have to keep a close eye on Shaw and Stanford in the coming years.
4. Kiffin couldn’t afford to gamble on a plan B
One of the primary reasons USC signed just 12 players, as opposed to 15, which it had hoped to do, largely stemmed from not wanting to take risks. With Murphy and Peat headed to Stanford and four-star quarterback Cyler Miles of Denver, Colo., signing with Washington in the afternoon on signing day, USC had two remaining options. One, it could try and fill the class with three-stars in order to reach 15. Or, it could save the three spots for next season. It opted to go with the latter. So, combined with five early enrollees, USC’s 2012 class wrapped up at 17 and next season, it will be able to sign a total of 18 — with three players counting toward the 12-signee 2012 class.
5. Fifteen can never be “greater” than 25
Despite the inference that quality trumps quantity on the recruiting trail, it’s a somewhat faulty premise. Sure, the Trojans had the highest average star rating, per Rivals.com this year at 4.07, but the restrictions can already be felt — as Kiffin is often quick to point out. Running back and defensive tackle remain two positions that could easily use more bodies. At tailback, USC has just three scholarship players and just two who have appeared in any meaningful games, senior Curtis McNeal and sophomore D.J. Morgan. It’s worth noting, as well, that Morgan has had injury problems in the past, including a torn anterior cruciate ligament during his senior year of high school. The transfer of Amir Carlisle didn’t exactly help either. And at defensive tackle, there are just four scholarship players, Suffice to say, USC can’t really afford serious injuries at either position come fall.

At home last weekend, the No. 16 Women of Troy took down St. Mary’s and Pepperdine to match their best start to a season since 2007 with a 5-0 record.
The two matches provided USC with a nice warm-up for the ITA National Indoor Championships this upcoming weekend in Virginia.
Playing against the Lady Gaels on Thursday, the Women of Troy dominated from the first set, sweeping all three doubles matches and repeating the feat after winning the six singles matches as well.
Serving up wins · The No. 16 Women of Troy had easy victories against their in-state opponents this weekend. USC is now 5-0 overall. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Court two held host to the game of the day as junior Danielle Lao had to stave off a late comeback by St. Mary’s Jenny Jullien. After defeating Jullien 6-2 in the first set, Lao, who ranks 42nd nationally, faltered 3-6 in the next set. In a thrilling tiebreaker, Jullien pushed the USC junior to the brink going up 6-2 in the final set, but Lao proved too much for Lady Gaels’ 68th-ranked sophomore rattling off eight out of the last 10 points to secure the victory.
The pair of freshmen for the Women of Troy seemed to have no trouble dispatching of their opponents with No. 19 Zoë Scandalis easily defeating SMC’s No. 82 Catherine Isip 6-1, 6-0 on court one and No. 18 Sabrina Santamaria taking down Jade Frampton in straight sets on court thre
On Saturday, the Women of Troy recovered from a slow start all around to sweep Pepperdine 7-0.
Despite falling into a 5-2 hole early on in the first set, Scandalis showed her resolve by storming back to force a tiebreaker against No. 72 Ale Granillo. Though the freshman found herself once again staring at defeat down 1-4 in the first set tiebreaker, she would once again come back to take the first set 7-6 (5). Granillo was trounced by Scandalis 6-1 in the second set to round out her victory.
“It was good to see Zoë come back,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “You’d prefer to not have to be in a position to come back, but she did a good job of picking her game up after a slow start.”
Santamaria and freshman Gabriella DeSimone added to the win total with victories on court three and five, respectively.
Danielle Lao proved triumphant against Khunpak Issara in second singles, 6-3, 6-4, in a hard-fought match that saw the USC junior constantly working for her points.
In the final match of the day, senior Alison Ramos fought back from a one-set deficit against Pepperdine’s Megan Moore to steal a win in three sets, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. Despite being on court six, both players hit the ball extremely well and it made for an exciting affair.
“Alison hits more winners than anyone else on the team when she gets in a groove,” Gallien said. “She lost the first set but didn’t get discouraged and came back strong to get the win.”
With this past weekend going as planned, the Women of Troy look to be hitting their stride as they head in to Virginia riding a five-game winning streak to start the year. For the younger girls, the ITA Indoor Championship should be a great way to continue to gain experience and as a for the team, a strong performance could really put them on the map.

The last two times the USC men’s basketball team traveled north to Seattle to face Washington at Alaska Airlines Arena, the team walked away with a victory in hand.
Saturday would be slightly different.
Road trippin’ · Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson scored a team high 15-points Saturday at Washington. Despite being down 10 points at the end of the first half, the Trojans were unable to close the gap on the first-place Huskies, eventually losing by a 28-point margin. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Facing the Huskies, the Trojans (6-18, 1-10) shot just 29 percent from the field en route to a 69-41 loss — their 14th in their last 16 games — in front of an announced crowd of 9,948.
Though eventually losing by 28 points, USC kept pace in the early goings. Initially, it grabbed a 7-4 lead at the start of the contest and trailed by 10 points at halftime.
But even in the first half, USC struggled to hang with the Huskies (16-7, 9-2).
Over the course of the first 20 minutes, the Trojans converted nine of 30 shot attempts and went 0-for-8 from 3-point range. They would not make a 3-pointer, missing their first 14 attempts, until about two minutes remaining in the game, finishing 1-for-16 from beyond the arc.
In the second half, the Huskies ran off 40 points, cruising to the easy win, keeping the Trojans winless on the road in Pac-12 play. USC has one road win all season — a 56-35 win at UC Riverside on Nov. 30.
At one point, leading 44-33 late in the second half, Washington went on an 18-0 run over a six minute stretch to balloon its lead to 62-33, squashing any remaining hope of a USC comeback
In recent weeks, season-ending injuries to sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon and junior forward Aaron Fuller have left six scholarship players healthy enough to play, and the Trojans have consequently had trouble scoring.
The 41 points scored against Washington marked the third-lowest scoring total this season and the lowest of any conference game.
Guard Tony Wroten played in spite of a deep thigh bruise that had hampered him in recent weeks, sidelining him for the final seven minutes of Thursday’s contest against UCLA.
Five players would score for the Trojans, and two finished in double-figures with sophomore forward Garrett Jackson and freshman guard Byron Wesley, chipping in 15 and 12 points, respectively.
By comparison, Washington saw 11 of its 13 players record at least two points. It was led by guard Tony Wroten, who led the way with 13 points, eight assists and six rebounds, keeping the Huskies ahead of California and Colorado in the Pac-12 standings by one game.
Guard Terrence Ross added 10 points and 14 rebounds for Washington. The victory marked the team’s fifth straight win.
The Trojans will return to the Galen Center this week to take on California Thursday and Stanford Sunday.
The Bears (18-6, 8-3) are currently tied for second place in the Pac-12 but have just a 2-4 record on the road. They defeated USC earlier this season at Haas Pavilion on Dec. 29 by a score of 53-49 in a close contest that wasn’t decided until the game’s final seconds.
Stanford (16-7, 6-5), meanwhile, has lost four of its last five games, including a 13-point defeat at home against Arizona on Feb. 4. Stanford beat USC 51-43 on Dec. 31 in its last matchup.
USC will close the season with four of its final seven Pac-12 games at the Galen Center and one road contest at the nearby Los Angeles Sports Arena against UCLA on Feb. 15. The Sports Arena is serving as the temporary home for UCLA this season, while Pauley Pavilion undergoes renovations. It will reopen next fall.

The 2012 commencement speaker is, by most measures, a tenacious individual. This year’s speaker is a journalist who has worked in crisis zones ranging from Iraq to Somalia, places that regularly bring grown men to their knees.
CNN host Christiane Amanpour also happens to be a woman — one of USC’s six female commencement speakers since 1924.
USC’s choices have shown a certain neglect for women’s achievements. In earlier decades, the lack of female commencement speakers made sense; in the United States, women couldn’t vote until 1920.
But as the decades passed and women gained more rights and agency, one would expect to see a steady increase in female commencement speakers. That clearly hasn’t been the case.
Nevertheless, by choosing Amanpour to send off the class of 2012, USC is showing a willingness to progress. We hope it will not take much longer to see another woman at the podium.
Some people might argue that the status quo at USC is favorable to women. Indeed, more than half the undergraduate population is female, and young women hold leadership positions in a wide variety of student organizations.
Unfortunately, matters in the real world are different. As a society, we’re used to seeing women at the workplace, but we’re still not used to seeing them in charge. In May 2011, only 12 Fortune 500 companies were led by women. The media has portrayed  powerful women as either airheads or shrews — see: former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Secretary of State Hilary Clinton.
It is difficult to imagine oneself in a leading role without good role models. As such, a university that does not choose female commencement speakers reinforces the following message: As a woman, you can get your education and go to work, but the top is for men only.
By choosing Amanpour, an internationally recognized journalist who has courageously reported from many frontlines, USC will remind its female graduates that their leadership experience need not stay confined to their student years.
Here’s to hoping USC picks another woman like Amanpour. She might even be a Trojan.
 
Totally agree with everything in the column except on one point: the portrayal of Sarah Palin. I’m sorry – this is just plain false. As bad as the media is, they got this one right.
And let’s not forget that as a society we are increasingly seeing women leaders in sectors they are usually absent from. The best example: engineering and science. IBM’s new CEO is a woman. So is HP’s. Yahoo was led by a woman for a long time. This is great progress. But it’s unjust to reduce it down to pure numbers. The fact is that women in these fields are scarce. The increase is a good sign on all fronts, but until women study in other fields apart from their statistically traditional majors, (I’m not going to enumerate them – these stats are easy to find) this won’t happen quickly.

There are certain things we’re supposed to take risks with: playing the lottery, asking someone out or an “educated” multiple choice guess. Young adults often take risks with their sexual health as well, for better or worse outcomes. But the real risk comes when we don’t realize what we’re putting at stake.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Sex comes with physical and emotional risks. In many situations, it’s essentially a gamble dependent on how much you trust your partner or how much you prepare for the game of cards.
A gambler might be told to quit gambling to lower his or her risk of losing money, but what about individuals having sex? Should they quit too?
Not necessarily. Though abstinence is a sure-fire way to avoid sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, there are other proven measures that people can take to lower their risk when having sex.
Condoms, for one, protect against HIV and most other sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.
We even have vaccines for human papilloma virus, which is the most common STI in the United States. Half of all sexually active men and women will contract it at some point in their lives, although most individuals’ immune systems will fight off the virus before these symptoms emerge — one in two is pretty high odds.
The fact that it is the main cause of cervical cancer raises the stakes even higher.
Still, the perception that HPV is solely a women’s health issue leaves many men in the dark about their own chance of contracting and suffering from other consequences of HPV.
Last year, the Journal of Clinical Oncology found a 225 percent rise in HPV-linked head, neck and throat cancers between 1988 and 2004. The study authors attributed this rise to oral sex.
That same year, the Center for Disease Control recommended that physicians vaccinate boys aged 11 to 21 with the HPV vaccine, and up to age 26 if the patient asks. Even so, the vaccine doesn’t provide 100 percent protection against all the HPV strains. In addition to the vaccine, the good old-fashioned condom should be used against HPV and other STIs.
The CDC also recommends that females be vaccinated before they are 26. In addition, gynecological appointments for sexually active women can help detect HPV and cervical cancer.
Even responsible individuals can hardly protect themselves from risks they don’t know about, which is why it is important for people to take initiative to inform themselves about their sexual behavior and the possible health consequences. Condoms and other forms of birth control aren’t 100 percent protective, but they come pretty close when used correctly.
The bottom line: Sex is a gamble, but so are many other things in life. Be informed, know what you are willing to wager and take the proper actions to ensure you are pleased with the payoff.
