Undergraduate Student Government and Trojan Pride hosted the first-ever wheelchair basketball tournament in the Galen Center.
The event, which took place on Friday afternoon, was supported by Michael Garafola of the UCLA Adaptive Recreation program as well as the Ranchos Los Amigos National Rehabilitation center, both of whom provided wheelchairs for the event. The tournament was originally proposed last semester by Zack Wentz, a student with disabilities majoring in economics.
“I’ve actually had the idea since back in high school. I thought it’d be cool that when I got to USC to put on an event like this,” Wentz said. “I just wanted to raise awareness about wheelchair basketball and the life of wheelchair users, although that’s kind of secondary to having people come out and have fun and just play.”
Wentz also said he hopes that the tournament will eventually evolve into an annual event following this year.
“I plan on this being an annual event,” Wentz said. “This is the first of many, including when I graduate, I’d love to come back and keep it going. But it’s great to open people’s eyes about the small things about living in a wheelchair and playing sports in a wheelchair. The people who were here today, hopefully they will attend more events like this, and as long as it positively affects one person then it’s a huge success.”
Ahlia Bethea, director of Trojan Pride, noted that the event couldn’t come to fruition without both Wentz’s vision for the tournament as well as the cooperation between both Trojan Pride and USG in creating the event.
“Zack had a vision to have a wheelchair basketball tournament here at USC,” Bethea said. “So he took it to USG, and USG contacted Trojan Pride, and we all worked together to bring the event today.”
Bethea also said the number and variety of students who attended the event surpassed their expectations.
“We actually started with eight sign-ups but we ended up having 11 teams today. So we had more than anticipated come out which was really exciting,” Bethea said. “Plus there’s a variety of people, able-bodied students, disabled students, from USG members, to fraternities, to non-affiliated students on campus, Trojan Pride members, everyone’s out here.”
USG Vice President Jordan Fowler, who also worked on the event last semester when she was director of University Affairs, said the timing of the event is fitting for the start of the new term since one of her and USG President Rini Sampath’s goals within USG is to help the disabled student community at USC.
“Rini and I are working really hard on disability accessibility on campus, with regards to housing, facilities on campus, mental health, the DSP office, and all different types of renovations in that area,” Fowler said. “I hope what this event does is show that we respect all members of the Trojan family. We can put each other in each others shoes and understand each other’s circumstances and come together as a whole.”
The winners of the tournament — a team consisting of students Brandon Au, Hunter Hurja, Brendan Nguyen, Logan Baron, June Castro and Zack Pickett — were rewarded with free coupons to Pizza Studio. When asked about his experience at the event, Baron, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that he would be willing to participate in the event in the future.
“We all had a lot of fun. It was a great bonding experience with all of my buddies, and we’re looking forward to do it again very soon if we can,” he said.
Bethea noted that the event was especially impactful by allowing students with disabilities to become more integrated within the Trojan family.
“It’s definitely created a space where disabled and able-bodied students can come together and participate in an activity that may not have been previously been a ground where they thought they could interact with,” she said. “I think that the disabled student body is now able to see that there are people who are here and excited to create spaces where they can partake in the activities that they enjoy.”

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times released polling results on the topic of race relations and education for the month of April. They discussed their findings in a phone conference on Monday morning and a series of online interviews with the Los Angeles Times and Dornsife.
The data conducted from the first poll found that most Californians felt race relations in their respective communities or cities were better in comparison to the state or nation as a whole and the latter data set revealed a divide between support or opposition for standardized testing in schools.
The data from first poll revealed that 63 percent of the Californians polled believed that race relations in the city they resided in met a good or excellent standard, while 27 percent of the polled voters felt that relations were good or excellent in the nation as a whole. Sixty-five percent of the respondents said that California is better than in other parts of the country in terms of race relations, compared to 24 percent who said that race relations were the same and 6 percent who believed it was worse.
In the first poll that surveyed popular opinion on the current state of schools, Director of the Unruh Institute Dan Schnur was interviewed about the results with Howard Blume, reporter for the Los Angeles Times. In the latter, Schnur discussed the results with Michael Finnegan, staff writer for the Los Angeles Times.
“We asked California voters a whole series of questions on the state of race relations in California and the nation as a whole in the wake of a whole series of police shootings of African Americans that have generated a lot of controversy,” said Finnegan in an interview with the L.A. Times and Dornsife. “What we found is that voters in California see race relations in California as significantly better than they do race relations in the country as a whole and they also see race relations in their own communities as even better than they are statewide.”
The surveys were conducted by Drew Lieberman, vice president at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, Inc.; David Kanevsky, research director of American Viewpoint; Mike Madrid, principal of Grassroots Lab; and Dan Schnur, executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
In response to a question about the progression of race relations within the last decade, 37 percent of respondents found that race relations have began to improve throughout the nation, 32 percent reported race relations to be the same, and 29 percent reported race relations to have gotten worse.
“There’s still a substantial amount of discrimination against African Americans and Latino Americans in particular, voters say,” Finnegan said. “African Americans and Latinos also report fairly substantial numbers experiencing discrimination themselves.”
The poll found that 36 percent thought that law enforcement treats all groups the same, in comparison to 43 percent of voters who believe that the police are tougher on African Americans.
During the conference, Schnur said that only a marginal percentage of respondents could have been informed with the death of unarmed black man who was shot by a South Carolina police officer in the beginning of April.
Results from the poll also found that among the polled black voters, 77 percent said that police were tougher on African Americans in contrast to 16 percent who said that police treated them the same.
“When we asked Californians about how law enforcement personnel — police and public safety officers, handled relationships with various communities, not only did African Americans feel like their relationships with the police were much worse, but, representatives of every other racial ethnic group felt that relationships between the police and African American community was much worse,” Schnur said in an interview with the L.A. Times and Dornsife.
The poll also asked voters a specific question on immigration on whether people thought illegal immigrants in the country had a positive or negative impact on the economy. The data proved that more people thought immigrants had a positive effect on the economy. Similarly, it also found that more and more Republicans think that illegal immigrants had a positive effect on the economy.
The second poll found partisan divides on the topic of education, specifically on standardized testing and areas of educational focus such as science and math or arts and music. Kanesky said that the gap among areas of educational focus might be contributed to a cultural divide, rather than variances in socioeconomic or racial factors.
The poll results found a nearly 1:1 ratio with 47 percent of voters in agreement with the fact that standardized testing hurts education in California, and 46 percent who believed that standardized testing fails to account for extraneous factors in the students’ schooling environment.
“This doesn’t really fall into the typical party lines on how voters view education, you see splits between some of the democratic coalitions on some of these issues,” Kanesky said in the conference call.
The data revealed that voters from California were overwhelmingly in support of guiding public school teachers. Results also found that teachers were a “trusted source” of information when discussing public schooling and that the state should do more to support teachers.
“[Voters] support apprenticeship programs for new teachers; they support higher education and advanced degree programs for teachers coming into the classroom; they want to see teachers paid salaries along the lines of what inarguably they deserve,” Schnur said.
According to Blume, results concluded that among the Caucasian voters surveyed, many felt that there was too much standardized testing, in contrast to many Latino voters who said that they felt the current number of testing was just right. The poll also displayed increasingly high numbers for those in favor or placing their children in charter schools, in comparison to results found within the last three years.

The Political Student Assembly hosted Syrian hip-hop artist Omar Offendum to present some of his music and spoken word poetry on Monday night at Tommy’s Place. Offendum answered students’ questions about his background and work.
Offendum has released an album SyrianamericanA and has toured the world with his critically acclaimed music about the democratic revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa. He has also helped raise thousands of dollars for humanitarian relief organizations.
The event was co-sponsored by the Performing Arts Committee and USC Students for Justice in Palestine.
Alex Luu, a freshman majoring in art, and Juan Negrete, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development, performed spoken word poems before Omar went on stage.
Offendum started the event by explaining that he makes music and tours to promote equality and justice.
“It’s a responsibility to be here, not just because I’m Syrian or Arab or Muslim or American or any of that, but because I’m a human being who believes in equality and justice for all people,” Offendum said. “That’s what drives me and my work and it was really, really great to hear the perspectives that you guys are bringing with your poetry so I really really encourage you guys to keep going expressing yourselves with art and with poetry; it’s a beautiful thing and that’s speaking from experience.”
After his first rap performance, Offendum presented a spoken word poem about his ethnic culture.
“But really though, who am I,” Offendum said. “Just another Middle Eastern man, that’s too good to be true am I … plotting another another coup am I? Belonging in a zoo am I? Hatin’ for lovin’ you am I? Palestinian Jew am I? African of the Northeast. Asian of the Southwest. European they want least. Semitic and I’m proud yes.”
Offendum later said that he wants to show people the beauty of Arabic culture.
“In this country, I think the only opportunity that people are afforded to hear this beautiful language is in a form of an angry dude yelling on TV and I want to break that cycle,” Offendum said.
According to Offendum, hip-hop is the modern way to spread culture ideals and traditions.
“I’d like to think hip-hop stand for ‘highly intellectualized people hovering over politics,’” he said. “We vent out our frustrations, our angers, this world through this music. This is something that is really a modern incarnation of things that have been happening all over the world for thousands of years.”

The USC women’s golf team wrapped up their regular season over the weekend as it competed in the Ping/ASU Invitational, hosted by ASU in Tempe.  USC was hot heading into the desert coming off two straight wins.
Following one day of action, the team had carded an overall score of 1-over 289, which placed them in seventh.  The Women of Troy were five shots back of leader Arkansas and three behind second place Duke.
Junior Annie Park and freshman Amy Lee came into the clubhouse following 1-under 71s.  Both women were tied for 14th following the first day of play.  Their rounds included four birdies each and a strong back nine on which they went 1-under.
On the second day of action, Park fired off a 6-under score of 67 to lead USC into fifth place with an overall score of par 576, however, the Women of Troy remained a distant 12 shots behind new leader ASU.
With the six birdie round, Park grabbed a share of the lead.  Park now has 21 rounds of shooting in the 60s, tying her with teammate, junior Kyung Kim for most on the team this season.  Both women are only one round shy of tying the school record which is 22.
Heading into the final day of action, Park was searching for her seventh career win.  Park already owns the record for most wins in school history.  Park fell short of her hopes though finishing third overall in the tournament.  Park finished the tournament at 5-under 211.
After getting off to a rough start that included three bogeys on the front nine, Park battled back with three back nine birdies regaining her share of the lead until a final bogey on hole 17 dropped her to one shot back.  Park now has three top-5 finishes on the year.
The other Trojan to have considerable success in the tournament was sophomore Gabriella Then who finished tied for sixth with a score of 2-under 214.  The finish is Then’s fourth top-10 finish in the last five events.
USC finished the tournament with a combined score of 6-over 870 which was nine back of first place Arizona.  Host ASU finished at 4-over, good enough for a second place tie with Baylor.  USC and the other USC (University of South Carolina) tied for fourth overall.
Senior Doris Chen made her spring debut for USC and finished tied for 39th at 6-over 222.  Following her strong day one performance, Lee slipped to 7-over 223 and tied for 45th.  Sophomore Karen Chung finished tied for 66th at 12-over 228.  The Ping/ASU Invitational was the final regular season competition for the Women of Troy.
USC will begin its postseason quest for a national championship starting April 20-22 in Boulder, Colorado, at the Pac-12 Championships.

USC fans have had a lot to celebrate so far in 2015. Our men’s basketball team pulled off an upset over Arizona State in the Pac-12 tournament. Our football team is no longer under the harsh sanctions of the NCAA, and Sark managed to sign a top ranked recruiting class. The baseball team had a fantastic showing at Dodger Stadium,    beating TCU, Vanderbilt and UCLA and is still ranked in the top 15.
But USC alumni have also given us plenty to be proud of, as a former Trojan has been elected into the Hall of Fame in all four of USC’s big sports in 2015 alone. Junior Seau, Randy Johnson, Lisa Leslie and George Raveling have all been voted into their respective sports’ Hall of Fame.
The late Junior Seau, one of the most iconic names to ever play for USC, was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Jan. 31. Seau was a linebacker at USC from 1988-1990. After going 19-4-1, making two Rose Bowl appearances and earning         All-American first team and  Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year honors, Seau bypassed his senior season to be the fifth pick in the NFL draft by the San Diego Chargers.
Seau spent 20 years in the NFL with the Chargers, Dolphins and Patriots. He played in 12 Pro Bowls, was named All-Pro eight times, and appeared in Super Bowls XXIX and XLII. He was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1992 and 1998 and, in 1994, he was the AFC Player of the Year. For his charitability, he was given the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 1994.
He is also a member of the USC Athletics Hall of Fame and the Chargers Hall of Fame.
Former left-handed pitcher Randy Johnson dominated college baseball at USC from 1983 to 1985 before going on to have a historic professional career. He was elected to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in January.
Johnson’s tenure in the MLB lasted 22 years. During that time, he was a member of 10 All-Star teams, won a World Series MVP in 2001 with the Arizona Diamondbacks and won five Cy Young Awards. He is one of only five pitchers to throw a no-hitter in both the National and American League. Johnson ended his career with a 3.29 ERA and logged 4,875 strikeouts.
Though the men’s basketball team has been quiet lately, former USC basketball coach George Raveling was selected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in February. Raveling coached the Trojans from 1986 to 1994, taking USC to two NCAA tournaments. Raveling was the   Pac-8 conference’s first black coach.
Most recently, Woman of Troy Lisa Leslie was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as well. During her time at Troy, Leslie was a                          three-time All-American and a National Player of the Year. She won National Freshman of the Year in 1991 and was the unanimous choice for the Naismith National Player of the Year in 1994. She is still USC’s all-time leading shot blocker.
After her time at USC, Leslie went on to have a successful WNBA career with the Los Angeles Sparks, winning three MVPs. She led the women’s national team to four Olympic gold medals, winning in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008. She is the WNBA’s leader in career rebounds.
In just over three months, four former Trojans have been honored for their decorated professional careers. With so many top teams at USC right now, I can’t help but wonder which current Trojans will receive the same recognition in the years to come.
Regan Estes is a sophomore majoring in public relations and Spanish. She is also the sports editor of  the Daily Trojan. Her column “Wild Wild Westes,” runs on Tuesdays.

As the 2015 season comes to a close, nobody has been able to stop the No. 1-ranked USC sand volleyball team. In their fourth consecutive week atop the AVCA national rankings, the Women of Troy (19-0) will look to finish off the season strong when they travel down to Irvine for a pair of dual matches against Concordia University and Irvine Valley College on Tuesday.
Of USC’s 19 dual matches played this season, 12 of them have been 5-0 sweeps, while five more have been 4-1 wins. The Women of Troy hope to maintain that spotless record when they face the two new collegiate sand programs.
USC will first play against the Concordia Eagles, a team in its first year of existence. The last time these two teams faced off was in a game televised on Pac-12 Networks back on April 2 at Merle Norman Stadium, where the Women of Troy easily defeated the Eagles by a 5-0 score. The No. 3 pairing of seniors Eve Ettinger and Meg Norton clinched the win for USC, delivering a 21-2, 21-4 pounding of Concordia’s Celeste Snider and Kyra Auten.
Immediately following that match, USC will take on the host, Irvine Valley College, for the first time ever. An NAIA school, the IVC Lasers are on a three-game win streak and look to put up a fight against the mighty Women of Troy. Head coach and 2014 AVCA National Coach of the Year Anna Collier, however, hopes to use these two matches as a chance to improve on some of the little things before closing out the regular season and heading into the AVCA Championships.
“We’re hoping to improve on our setting, especially in the wind, and on our serving,” Collier said. “The beach over there [in Irvine] is very windy, so getting used to serving and setting in the wind is very important, and I’ve been stressing that to the girls this week.”
It has been a long stretch of games for the Women of Troy this week as well. After sending their five seniors off in winning fashion last Thursday on Senior Day at Merle Norman Stadium, USC took a trip to Hermosa Beach over the weekend for the USAV Beach Collegiate Challenge. The Women of Troy easily swept Santa Clara (6-4) and Boise State                         (3-10) to notch their 18th and 19th wins of the season, while three USC pairs made it to the final round of bracket play in the pairs championship. While USC’s No. 2 pairing of junior Alexa Strange and sophomore Sophie Bukovec took home second place in the silver pairs’ bracket, the  No. 1 duo consisting of sophomores Sara Hughes and Kelly Claes took home the gold-bracket crown and the No. 4 pairing of sophomores Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler won the bronze-bracket crown. Furthermore, Eve Ettinger and Meg Norton advanced to the silver quarterfinals, while freshman Jenna Belton and senior Bria Russ at the five spot advanced to the bronze semifinals. After adding two wins to their record and sending those three pairs to the finals of bracket play in Hermosa, Collier is excited for the challenge down in Irvine.
“The extra prep we can get is exactly why we schedule these kinds of matches at the end of the season, especially after we play some tough matches like we did over the weekend,” Collier said. “We had a day off yesterday, we figured out what we needed to work on, and then we’ll try and execute it as best we can the next time we’re on the court.”
The first tipoff between the Women of Troy and the Concordia Eagles will start at 1:30 p.m. The match against the host Irvine Valley Lasers will begin at 3 p.m.
Following the last match of the season, the Women of Troy will play in the Pac-12 Invitational in Santa Monica on April 18 and 19. Should USC qualify, the AVCA Sand Volleyball Collegiate Championships begin on May 1.
Last season, the team did not lose a single match in the Pac-12 Tournament but fell to Hawai’i and Pepperdine in the AVCA Championships in Gulf Shores, Alabama.

The USC baseball team will look to rebound tonight against the Pepperdine University Waves after losing two out of three to the UCLA Bruins in a hard-fought series over the weekend. Dedeaux Field was packed all weekend, as Los Angeles was buzzing about the matchup between the crosstown rivals, both ranked in the top-10 in the nation.
The Trojans (26-9, 8-4 Pac-12) dropped the first game on Friday 9-3, as they were unable to rally from an early deficit in the first inning.
USC starter Brent Wheatley allowed a three-run home run in the first inning and a two-run rally in the third inning, but was able to settle down eventually to give the Trojans 5.1 relatively solid innings before yielding to the bullpen.
The Trojans responded with a    two-run rally of their own in the bottom of the third, but it proved insignificant. UCLA pounded their second three-run shot of the night in the top of the seventh to put the game away for good.
USC responded on Saturday, however, by jumping out to a first inning lead they would never relinquish.
Senior second baseman Dante Flores connected for a huge two-out, two-run double in the bottom of the first against Bruin starter Grant Watson. Bobby Stahel added a two-run homer in the bottom of the second, then tacked on an extra insurance run in the bottom of the sixth with an RBI single.
That was all the offense Trojan starter Kyle Twomey needed, as he twirled seven shutout innings, allowing seven hits and three walks, while striking out seven, to even the series at 1-1.
The rubber match of the series didn’t go the Trojans way, though, as the Bruins took advantage of a big sixth inning.
With the score tied at 2-2 in the top of the sixth, UCLA led off the inning with a pair of doubles to put themselves ahead 3-2, but it didn’t stop there. After a fly out advanced Ty Moore to third base, Kort Peterson lined out to left field, sending Moore dashing home on the sacrifice fly.
Left fielder Bobby Stahel made a perfect throw to the plate to beat the runner, but Trojan catcher Garrett Stubbs was unable to hold onto the ball after a hard collision with Moore. The runner was called safe, and UCLA went ahead 4-2.
The next batter, Darrell Miller Jr., stepped up to the plate and launched a solo home run to add on to the Bruins’ lead and chase Trojan starter Mitch Hart from the game.
USC fought back from the three-run deficit, but only managed one run in the bottom of the sixth inning on a Jeremy Martinez sac fly.
The Bruins put the game away in the top of the ninth by rallying to score three more off of sophomore reliever Kyle Davis, and just like that, the Trojans yielded the game and the series to the Bruins.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs thinks his team fought hard this weekend but wasn’t able to execute well enough in any aspect of the game during their losses on Friday and Sunday.
“We didn’t really get a good start out of [Wheatley] and we couldn’t come up with a big hit in a big spot on Friday,” Hubbs said.
“We didn’t really play great defense on Friday either and if [Stubbs] holds onto that ball on the play at the plate on Sunday, the inning is over, they don’t score and it’s a whole different ball game.”
The Trojans can bounce back on the road against Pepperdine (20-17, 10-5 WCC) on Tuesday.
The Waves have won nine of their last 11 contests and are fresh off a sweep of Santa Clara University this weekend. The Pepperdine offense has relied on their 2-3 duo of Hutton Moyer and Brad Anderson all season, as the two have combined for 54 RBIs through only 37 games. Hubbs says stopping them will be a key to the Trojans’ success on Tuesday.
“It’s imperative to get the guys out that hit around them so that Moyer and Anderson don’t get to hit with guys on base,” Hubbs said.
“We’ll have to make pitches and make plays to get them out.”
The Trojans will start junior Kyle Davis on Tuesday in attempts to get him back on track after a rough season thus far. After dazzling the Pac-12 last year with a 1.12 ERA, Davis has struggled to a 5.11 ERA this season, but Hubbs thinks that letting him pitch the first two innings against Pepperdine might help get him back to his previous dominance.
“We’ll let him get out there for a couple innings and see what he can do,” Hubbs said.
“We’re really just trying to get him back to the type of pitcher we know he can be on the mound.”
USC was able to handle the Waves in their only other matchup this season, beating them 5-2 on March 24th at Dedeaux Field.
“When you’ve been doing this long enough, you know there’s no such thing as a soft landing spot. No matter who you play in Southern California, everybody is going to be good,” Hubbs said.
“Last time we played [Pepperdine], I thought they hit the ball well, but luckily they ended up right at our fielders. We’re going to have to play well to beat them again.”

Sunday, April 12 2015 was notable for two different (yet eerily similar) events; however, depending on how you look at them or who you are, they could both easily be considered equally monumental for women at large. The events I am talking about are, first: Hillary Clinton’s announcement to run for the presidential office in 2016, and second: the premiere of the fourth season of HBO’s comedy Veep starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
Clinton’s announcement, although no surprise, still marks an important monument in history where a woman hopes to become the first woman in the Oval Office. Though not her first campaign, the anticipation for Clinton’s announcement could be considered palpable, with both Hollywood and D.C. heavy-hitters (such as Lena Dunham and Barbara Boxer, respectively) taking to Twitter to publicly support Clinton’s campaign. On the flipside in Veep’s television fictional universe, Dreyfus’ character Selina Meyers has just become the first female president of the United States.
It’s clear that the Veep- — the premise of which was born out the Sarah Palin-era of mockery that explored the ineptitude of vice presidents — has taken a life of its own. In the season premiere, Selina Meyers has been promoted from vice president to president after her male predecessor resigned in the shocking last season finale. While the previous three seasons were marred by not only an ineptitude of those surrounding Meyers, but also Meyers’ crass and immoral nature, season four seems to be making new ground for both the show and its star. Now as the president, Meyers has a newfound assuredness, occupying the oval office with a certain swagger in a navy zippered pencil skirt as she flits from countless meeting to meeting. At one point, Meyers says with a gleeful smile, “Yeah, cause I’m the president, see. Everything’s my fault now.” Earlier in the episode, as she shakes hands excitedly prior to her first joint session, she says, “We’re making history.”  Seconds later, as one cabinet member shakes a little too vigorously, Meyers utters: ”Ow, you’re hurting my hand,” not simply for comedic effect but to underscore her delicate yet affirmed position as the first ever woman in the White House who is ready to take charge.
Furthermore, those closest to her in the White House accept her status change with excitement and ease. At one point her press secretary exclaims, “That was the actual president of the United States! She calls me Mike.” Others easily transition as well—the term “Madame President” rings out multiple times throughout the show. Some characters even go so far as to correct certain phrases to make way for the gender change, for instance the White House’s poll crunching guy Kent Davison (Gary Cole) — who played the clear antagonist to the Veep in previous seasons — now offers Meyers deep respect and admiration and at one point (after Meyers has made an executive decision) tells her, “That was masterly, ma’am. Or mistress-ly, whichever isn’t offensive.”
Later, right before a group of military men are set with Meyers for a meeting to work over some numbers in the country’s budget, one of her staff members warns her to be wary of the men’s masculine negotiating tactics. Meyers responds assuredly and with a laugh, stating, “What are you talking about? I’m used to dealing with angry, aggressive, dysfunctional men. i.e.: men.” This furthers the show’s agenda for promoting Selina’s new status as a capable and ball-busting woman in office.
Of course, that isn’t to say Meyer’s new position in the White House doesn’t happen without its hitches — the entire premise of the show would be thrown out the window if that were true.  Instead, Meyers’ new role is used as a way to raise the stakes within the show. Furthermore, those around Meyers in the season premiere are still as incapable as ever, but juxtaposed with Meyers’ newfound power the mistakes pave way for more comedy gold than ever before. At the end of the episode — after Meyers has just announced she would fund $10 billion more to a project she wanted to scrap earlier simply because her right-hand people found they couldn’t edit the teleprompter in time — Meyers stands in the oval office and faces her staff. After hearing their pitiful but heartfelt excuses, Meyers orders every person out of the office. And because she’s the president, they do just that.
When contrasted with other comedic shows that feature female protagonists on television — such as New Girl or The Mindy Project or even HBO’s “progressive” Girls — Veep, no matter their mix-ups and tragedies, features a woman in the highest position of power possible. In terms of real life, Hillary Clinton herself is undoubtedly familiar with both the campaign trail and the White House itself, but maybe those personally unaffiliated with Washington, D.C. — i.e. audience members and future voters in 2016 who consume media at rapid-fire pace — should prepare for a woman in office by turning to HBO’s Veep, and seeing how exceptionally well a woman fits into the White House after all, mistakes and all.

With all of the new restaurants opening on Main Street, finding a stable eatery can be stressful. Though many of those locations offer a variety of delicious staples, the food selection tends to follow the same trends. Luckily, Ledlow, formerly known as Pete’s Café & Bar, brings the kick back to wholesome American food.
For those unfamiliar with the location, Ledlow was once the popular Pete’s. Though Pete’s will be missed, it certainly did need a more updated approach to maintain competitiveness in the Old Bank’s District. Exemplified by the number of trendy choices on Main Street, restaurants stay afloat by staying relevant. Chef Josef Centeno, who also owns other big name restaurants such as Bäco Mercat, Bar Amá and Orsa and Winston, took on the daunting challenge of shaping a distinct personality for Ledlow. So just how different is Ledlow from the rest of its family line?
First off, Ledlow offers various brunch, lunch and dinner options as it opens at 8 a.m. and closes late in the evening. Even though many restaurants avoid approaching savory foods for fear of coming off as too greasy or too heavy, Ledlow ambitiously spins classic American favorites and fuses them with influences from European-style food. It’s a place to pick up a delicious cup of Stumptown coffee along with some small pastries or a full, hearty meal for a big party. Along with the wall of liquor and spirits, it’s a perfect place for comfort food. There is an entire menu devoted to those who want a stronger drink with their meal.
The retro, yet modernly decorated restaurant provides a relaxing, upscale atmosphere on the corner of Main and East 4th streets.  Recently, the trend toward healthy alternatives has led to the erasure of more stomach-filling meals. There are foods that are good for the body and some that are good for the soul, and Ledlow provides both. This is not to say the menu lacks lighter alternatives; in fact it has plenty of vegetarian options. The dish “Healthy Breakfast” is a blend of egg whites, sauteed mushrooms, soy chorizo, greens and quinoa. Instead of being served separately on one dish, however, this left-field approach brought an unexpected savory taste that deliciously blended all the ingredients together to make a fluffy omelet-like dish.
Whereas many places offer the standard French toast, Ledlow has its own take on the breakfast staple. French toast has had the misfortune of being pushed to the side in favor of its fluffy cousin, pancakes. Many restaurants offer this common breakfast food but they often leave it dry, tasteless and tough. French toast wasn’t meant to taste like baked maple syrup, however; the syrup is only meant to compliment the bread, not moisturize and flavor it. Thankfully, Ledlow’s homemade,fluffy brioche absorbs all the richness from the huckleberry syrup and mixes well with the tartness of the blueberries. Along with the melted brown butter, Ledlow’s take on French toast is truly revolutionary and one of the best items on the menu.
The baked eggs en cocotte, a dish with tomato, beef and green chile, was surprisingly heavier than it seemed to be. This baked dish comes with a side of toasted rye bread to soak up the slightly overpowering flavors in the pan. This dark horse may be too much for someone hoping for a simple, plain brunch option. But it’s perfect for a brunch lover who wants a homey, medium dish that combines the size of a brunch with the taste of a lunch.
As for the pastries, the beignets are topped with granulated sugar, which is a spin on the usual powdered-sugar surface. Though this approach is not unique to Ledlow, it does give a crunchy and crispy texture that blends well with the rich chocolate inside. It’s too sweet and too big as a snack to go with coffee, however. If it were shrunken to about the size of their almond croissant, the combination would be perfect for an afternoon tea session. At the same time, the normal, chocolate-filled croissants are flaky and a definite improvement compared to what Pete’s used to offer. The almond croissant is also a tasty inclusion of a nutty flavor within crisp layers of pastry.
Oddly, other than a few simple choices such as oatmeal and granola, the menu doesn’t include very many breakfast options. Since the restaurant opens early in the morning, it would certainly benefit from a larger morning-food menu.
Ledlow provides quality comfort food that has been lost in the hurricane health craze. Though a lot of the dishes are very savory and rich, it’s a refreshing changed compared to the popular wave of light brunches. It’s definitely a place to stop by for something new and familiar or a trip just for old times’ sake.

The shooting of Walter Scott by officer Michael Slager in North Charleston, South Carolina, this past week has brought last year’s outrage over Ferguson and Garner back to the front lines. Body cameras still seem to be America’s favorite solution to this problem. Mayor of South Charleston Keith Summey said that in response to the incident, the city has ordered enough cameras for every police officer.
In a perfect world, police body cameras would provide indisputable evidence. Violent cops would be held accountable for their actions in court, thereby discouraging other officers from engaging in violent actions and eliminating police brutality all together in the future.
That conclusion, however, treats police body cameras as a complete solution instead of a first step. Video evidence might seem to be enough to throw anyone in jail, but the Eric Garner case proved that to not always be true.
To recap, Eric Garner was an unarmed black man who was killed by a New York City police officer. The event reached the spotlight because of a civilian cell phone video showing the officer grabbing Garner’s throat from behind and maintaining the choke hold despite Garner’s very audible protests that he could not breathe. Video evidence was not enough, however, to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo.
It would also be ignorant of me to claim that the Garner case proves anything negative about police body cameras. In fact, had Pantaleo been wearing a camera at the time, it is possible that he wouldn’t have used the force he did. It does, however, make it clear that an officer being caught on camera using unnecessary force doesn’t necessitate the officer being held accountable.
In 1989, the United States Supreme Court clarified in Graham v. Connor that under the Fourth Amendment, police officers are not held under the same due process standards to which civilians are held. Instead, juries are asked to consider excessive force by law enforcement officials under the “objective reasonableness” standard.
Perhaps the most important wording used by the Graham court is that “the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” In other words, the jury is asked to imagine a reasonable officer and consider whether such an officer might believe the specific use of force was reasonable.
It cannot be known whether this logic was used in the Garner case. Graham v. Connor, however, does set a clear precedent that police officers are to be given the benefit of the doubt that citizens are not privy to. There are, without a doubt, situations in which such benefit of the doubt is warranted, but surely not in circumstances with very plain video evidence.
Police body cameras are part of the solution. They are, however, just one response to the problem. In order to truly eliminate police brutality, we need to ensure that accused officers, with or without video evidence, aren’t given too much benefit of the doubt.

Earlier this month, a brutal cell phone video emerged in which a white police officer shot an unarmed black man. Michael Slager, the officer who has been charged with murder, fired his pistol eight times, striking the victim, Walter Scott, in the back. Scott collapsed and died from his wounds a short while after. Critics and the mayor of North Charleston, South Carolina where the incident occurred have pressed for the implementation of body cameras for all officers to avoid future events like this. Their ideology supports the notion of increased jurisprudence on the issue of police brutality.
Even President Barack Obama has jumped on the police camera bandwagon. In the wake of the Michael Brown and Eric Garner tragedies, Obama pledged $263 million to better equip police officers with body cameras and better training. One reason why many police forces aren’t equipped with body cameras is because of their expensive price tag. This funding will help officers with evidence collection in the event that a crime occurs and the footage needs to go to trial.
Evidence collection holds police officers responsible for their actions. In the United States, police officers rarely see jail time because of legislation protecting their duty to keep the peace. An officer can make a split-second decision to aim and fire to protect the community; consequently, it’s nearly impossible to prove malice in a court of law.
It’s true that Officer Daniel Pantaleo was not indicted for his execution of a fatal chokehold on Garner even though cell phone footage showed Garner struggling for air, shouting “I can’t breathe!” It could be argued that if cell phone evidence can’t prove that someone’s guilty, then a police body camera with much lower quality would definitely not do the job. There are, however, cases where no one is able to take a video of what happened. Then, what’s left are eyewitness accounts — if there are any -— and faulty suppositions. Body cameras must be mandated in order to present the truest form of what happened.
Indeed, the implementation of body cameras could eliminate false narratives. Walter Scott’s son Erik died when he was walking out of Costco and a police officer shot him to death. The officer was not indicted because local Costco personnel and area law enforcement obliterated any sign of security video. To avoid similar incidents, Scott wrote in an article for Politico, “The answer, it seems to me, is simple: If you’re entrusted with a badge and gun, then you must be held accountable by being required to wear bodycams and accept zero-tolerance protocols that ensure their proper use.” The mere presence of body cameras might have motivated the officers involved in Erik Scott’s death to be less impulsive about their conduct.
With a 91 percent approval rating from the public, body cameras are still considered experimental. They aren’t perfect, with privacy issues still to be worked out, but a San Diego pilot program of police body cameras reported a decreased brutality by 46.5 percent and civilian complaints by over 40 percent. The numbers illustrate the accountability body cameras equip police officers.
Police officers need to keep up with the technology age too. It’s time that their motto, “to protect and to serve,” is met with complete assurance, and that starts with an accurate capture of their conduct.
Danni Wang is a sophomore majoring in psychology. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Tuesdays.
Can’t argue against body cameras. In some cases they would prevent rash actions, and in others, would document what happened. One also needs to understand that the officer is experiencing adrenaline response, rage, and genuine fear of the perpetrator. Not sure if role-playing training and other psychological training would help, but I believe it would. To really understand this, though, one needs to have experienced the terror of being assaulted, or even fired at by a criminal. Those of us who have been police or in a combat zone understand how quickly things happen at such times.

Clean Bandit is an electronic dance group founded in 2009 in Cambridge, England. Recently their success with song “Rather Be” has spurred a huge following now not only in their home of the U.K., but also here in the United States. We sat down to talk to Grace Chatto, a member of Clean Bandit, about the group’s upcoming show on April 15 at the Fonda Theater as well as their rise to success in the EDM world.
DT: What are you most excited about performing in L.A.?
C: One of our first big shows in America was in Los Angeles and it was just such a crazy “L.A. experience” show. It was such a surprise factor coming over here, our reception was so much warmer and that was the lovely thing about the beginning of that LA show. We had an amazing time and it was a great crowd so we are so excited to be back and have a similar experience. 
DT: Is there a certain vibe or feeling you hope to express at your shows? In other words, what do you hope listeners get out of coming to see you perform and listen to your music?
C: I think a lot of people who know “Rather Be” or have followed the band before expect an electronic scene where actually we want to bring a more intimate space of color and styling with electric content. We like to bring in bass guitars and electric guitars and piano so that it’s not just about a guy with a laptop and I hope this excites people about what we are. 
DT: I know that electronic music has been around in Europe for a while, yet has just recently come to the United States. What do you think about the electronic music trend becoming so widely accepted and popular outside of Europe?
C: It’s been really cool to see how electronic music has come to the United States. It seems to be heading in the direction that it was moving in the UK a few years ago I feel like its expanding in the sense that it is more emotional and diverse. Its really exciting to watch see it taking off. 
DT: What has been the hardest part about getting to where you are as artists now?
C: It has been a lot of hard work. We’ve been working and managing for the past six years and its really been all consuming. However its been an amazing journey and we’ve had such a great time and have been able to travel the world and 
DT: What has been the highlight of your career so far?
C: Winning the Grammy for “Rather Be” had to have been the highlight. That was just amazing, you know? Just being able to perform too now on our second nation-wide tour of the US. We were in for Coachella this last weekend and it was just incredible to be performing at a big festival in front of all those people, it was really a beautiful experience.
DT: What are your plans for the future and how do you hope to achieve your goals, specifically within the realm of the electronic music movement?
C: Well, were working now on our second album. We’re working really hard on that. We’re also excited about all our future performances and making sure we keep delivering great shows. We want to perform in really unexpected venues starting our shows off with classical music and working in drums and guitars and creating a “rave like feel” from that.  We’re also excited about our new single coming out called “Stronger” featuring vocals from up and coming artists Alex Newell and Sean Bass. 
The official music video for “Stronger” is on Youtube.  The song is now available for pre-order on iTunes along with the purchase of the group’s first album, “New Eyes.”

Whether it’s by moped or foot, people need to get places daily. While public transportation isn’t such a big deal here in L.A., it definitely makes up a huge component in cities like Buenos Aires and Paris where the bus, taxi and subway systems are well-developed and well-used. After all, the joy of travel lies not just in the destination, but the journey itself as well. From the hoof of a horse to the whir of a tram, fellow Trojans studying abroad snapped a few photos of the different ways of getting around in their new hometowns.

This weekend, I had the opportunity to do something I haven’t done since I began my study abroad experience three months ago — I (temporarily) returned to U.S. soil.
No, I didn’t hop on a plane back to the States. Instead, my entire program at USC Paris took a bus west towards the French region of Normandy and the Cimetière Américain de Colleville-sur-Mer, or the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial. It was on Normandy’s beaches that the infamous D-Day landings of World War II took place in 1944. In honor of the role the U.S. played in the invasion and the countless Americans who lost their lives in the Normandy campaign and World War II, France granted the use of the land for the cemetery to the American government as a permanent burial ground. To this day, the memorial is the largest American military cemetery on foreign soil.
This site is of particular importance to the French, as it was the Allied invasion of Normandy, otherwise known as “Operation Overlord,” that ultimately secured the liberation of France from Nazi occupation and the restoration of the French Republic. But as American students, the visit held a particular importance to us as well. Unlike most of our visits and excursions during which we typically learn about France or European history, this time, we were witnessing a history we were quite familiar with — our own.
As someone who went on my 8th grade trip to Washington D.C. and has been to one too many monuments since beginning study abroad, I’ll admit that it’s pretty easy to get desensitized to all the important historical sites. After a while, one important cathedral starts to look like the last five, and before long, you won’t be able to remember which Napoleon did what and when.
But despite the historical overload, it’s not every day that you get to visualize history up close. And though it was fun to joke about returning to American soil (if only for a couple of hours), bearing witness to the more than 9,000 headstones spanning across the 172 acre memorial allowed me to remember that there’s something truly special about witnessing an important site in one’s own national history despite being thousands of miles away from home.

Hi. For information, the US cemetery of Colleville isn’t the biggest US cemetery in foreign soil. It’s the 4th one. Far behind the first one in Manilla, with 17000 headstones !

There is no way that ordering a meal by saying, “I am happy,” could possibly go wrong, especially when you’re at Café Gratitude, a vegan restaurant located in the arts district that inspires its diners to become healthier and more.
The hipster locale has a soothing ambience with calm music and an outdoor patio. We sat there for hours, well after finishing our lunches because the place was simply too homey to leave it so fast.  In fact, it wasn’t enough to just eat there. We were so infatuated with the restaurant that when we got back home we ordered their cookbooks and decided that we wanted to go on their three-day juice cleanse.
Each food item on the menu is titled with a positive word, and at the top of the menu, the words “I AM…” are inscripted. When you order then, you must say those magic words.

I am happy.
I ordered the Mediterranean Raw Wrap, which had sundried tomato wrap with raw falafels, zucchini cilantro hummus, spinach, red onion, tomato and harissa sauce. The waitress warned me that it was not a normal tortilla.  I ordered it anyway, and it didn’t end up being as bad as she had made it sound.  It had a harder consistency that made it more difficult to bite, but the sundried tomatoes gave it an exotic flavor.
I am blissful.
The blueberry chia seed shake was delicious.  The drink consisted of blueberries, peaches, coconut yogurt, dates, chia seeds and vanilla bean.  Served ice cold, it was perfect for the sunny day.
I am open.
The coffee cake they serve is seasonal. We had the maple pumpkin, a great combination.  It was perfect size for sharing. If it happens to be your birthday, they will top it off with a candle and a group of servers singing “Happy Birthday” in a cappella.
The friendly servers have a positive vibe that just sets the peaceful mood. They replied to our orders by saying repeating our statements back to us: “You are happy, you are blissful, you are open,” making us actually feel all those things. After they seated us, they also gave our group “the question of the day,” sparking meaningful table conversations.
“What are you grateful for today?” was ours.
This restaurant. Definitely this restaurant.

As a Jew, Easter for me usually means stocking up on jellybeans and peeps at the least, and being invited to dinner at my Gentile friends’ houses if I’m lucky.
Spending “Pascua” (Easter) in Spain is a different story. The majority of Spain’s population is Catholic, and everyone goes on vacation the entire week leading up to Easter, known as “Semana Santa,” if not the week after as well. For study abroad students, “Semana Santa” is synonymous to Spring Break in Cabo San Lucas. (Mine could not be further from Cabo – I spent the week exploring and hiking through Norway and Denmark in 30-40˚F through rain, snow and hail.)
Nevertheless, upon my return to Madrid the Friday before Easter, my host mom invited me to spend Easter with her family in her “pueblo,” or small town, on the outskirts of Segovia. I had heard a lot about her “pueblo,” but I had yet to see it for myself. With not much else to do for the weekend, knowing many stores and restaurants would be closed, I agreed and figured it would be a good exercise of my Spanish skills at the very least.
A short hour later, we arrived in Melque de Cercos: Population 108.  The town literally popped up out of acres and acres of farmland and nothingness. If I hadn’t been awake for the majority of the car ride, I would have thought we were hours outside Madrid based on how desolate the area was.
Rosario’s home in Melque has been in her family for generations, and I could quickly tell it’s something she takes a lot of pride in. After a tour of the house, Rosario’s son Fernando invited me to go for tapas with his girlfriend and his friends from the town. Fernando, who now has a son of his own that he brings to Melque, spent all his weekends, vacations and summers in the town as a child, so he’s known his friends from Melque practically all his life.
Despite my feeling like a little bit of an outsider, his friends welcomed me warmly and one even corrected me for referring to him in the informal sense, scolding me after I called him “usted”, the formal form of “you” instead of “tú” which is reserved for family and friends.
Over the next three hours we went to four different restaurants. The whole evening was very typically Spaniard: people argued over who was going to pay the check, debated over which restaurant served the best tapas and contemplated where to go next. Going for tapas in Spain is quite the event. It’s more like bar hopping for food rather than just sharing small plates at a trendy restaurant like in the United States.
After dinner, we went back to the house for a little while to relax and watch TV. When we were flipping through the channels, Fernando stopped to watch a mass that was being broadcasted. He asked if I was Catholic and if I was going to come to mass with them the next day. When I told him I was Jewish, he seemed surprised but intrigued. He and his girlfriend proceeded to ask me a number of questions about Judaism, as he hadn’t met more than a handful of Jews in his entire life. When Rosario realized I was Jewish earlier in the semester, she was equally as surprised. She told me that I was the first Jewish student that stayed in her house after almost 10 years of hosting foreign students. She welcomed the difference, quickly telling me that she was accepting of all religions, which I thought was a nice gesture.
Around midnight, Fernando invited me to go for coffee with him and his friends in the main plaza. I tagged along, but quickly realized they were going out for the night rather than just having a cup of coffee.
I literally could not hang….with four 30-something-year old Spaniards. Sounds lame, I know, but I lasted for about two hours in the loud bar, trying to follow the rapid conversation in Spanish while succeeding in only understanding every fourth word. By about 2:30 a.m., when it was clear they were going to order another round of drinks, I decided it was time for me to go home. Much to my surprise, my 75 plus-year-old host parents and Ulysses, their 9-year-old grandson (Fernando’s son), were still awake as well. Ulysses had even been playing in the street with his friends until nearly 2 a.m. It is becoming easier for me to understand how Spaniards are so accustomed to staying out partying until 7 a.m. Their all-nighter attitude is groomed from a young age.
We all woke up late the next morning, and relaxed until lunch. Fernando showed me the fields behind the town where his family has had a wine vineyard for generations, and I helped Rosario make lunch after she got home from mass. After a long, traditional Spanish lunch it was time for a “siesta,” and I, along with the rest of the small, sleepy town slipped into a post-Pascua food coma.
