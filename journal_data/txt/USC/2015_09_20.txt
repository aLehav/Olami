USC exchange students visit Manhattan Beach. Going to a beach near school is a new opportunity for many of USC’s exchange students. Grace Lam | Daily Trojan
My name is Grace and I am an exchange student from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology attending USC for the next four months. 
It has been a marvelous four weeks here. I felt like I was a freshman again, overwhelmed by the number of clubs and societies at the Involvement Fair, wandering around campus trying to find my way to classes, and trying food in different restaurants and cafes on campus. Despite the fact that I was born in Singapore, I clearly identify myself as a Hongkonger after moving to the city when I was three. Having grown up and studied in Hong Kong for my entire life, here are some of my observations about USC that you would not see at at my home university.
1.Skateboards and bicycles
I was amazed by how swiftly students use skateboards to commute from one place to another. Hong Kong is a hilly place so it is nearly impossible to skate or bike from one place to another. To put things into perspective, my university is actually built along a mountain and not a single path connecting two buildings is flat. It is great to see that some of my exchange student friends have started to pick up skateboarding
2. Greek associations
This should not be surprising. Fraternities and sororities are just not popularized in Hong Kong. It is really cool that these associations even have houses for their members. Very similar to these greek associations, the society culture at the universities in Hong Kong is very strong too, always emphasizing heritage and legacy. Serving on the executive committee board in a student society is considered a “must-do” for a college student in Hong Kong.
3. Apartments for students
One thing you should know about Hong Kong, is how precious a piece of land is in the city. Hong Kong is notorious for sky-high property prices, and an extremely dense population. Due to a lack of space, a typical student dorm would be a double or triple room with a shared bathroom and kitchen. Luckily, the property price does not apply to university housing. For full-time students, the rent is also much lower than it is at USC. For example, at my home university, it costs around $1,300 annually .
4. Female students wearing backpacks
Believe it or not, I have probably seen more women wearing backpacks on campus in these four weeks than the two years in Hong Kong combined. Don’t get me wrong — there are backpacks sold in Hong Kong. It’s just that it is generally more popular among high school students than college students. Most female college students would not wear their backpacks they have worn in the past six years to a university, and would choose to wear shoulder bags or tote bags instead.

Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The Thornton School of Music is one of the most prestigious and well known music institutions in the country. With a wide variety of classes and a myriad of talented and successful faculty members, the opportunities are endless for budding, experienced musicians. 
One of the most interesting aspects of taking a music class at USC is the diverse range of topics within music that one can take. History of electronic dance music is a course that really made me appreciate how many different opportunities there are to explore unconventional topics here at USC. This class, which has been offered since Fall 2013, has since taken the campus by storm. Students can learn about a new era of music that they’re currently witnessing such as the EDM genre, which has garnered much controversy and excitement in the last few years. With unique classes like this one, USC is paving the way in music study. 
Students can also take personalized music instruction courses at USC. These classes allow for one-on-one study with an instrument and the professor. Not only do these classes foster a greater relationship between professor and student, but they also allow for a broader experience within students’ individual focuses to help them gain understanding and mastery of theory. 
Part of what makes USC’s music studies so great is its successful faculty. USC boasts a few of the most successful individuals in their fields, working all across the globe to create a bright new future for the music world. Andrea Stolpe of the songwriting division of popular music has worked both in Nashville and L.A. with artists such as Faith Hill and Julianne Hough. Vocal arts and opera instructor Shigemi Matsumoto made her opera debut at the age of 22 and has been recognized around the world for her stellar talent. The kind of experience these incredible professors bring to the students is one of both skill and joy that encourages the students to pursue their passions, ambitions and to change the face of the world of music. 
Taking a music class at USC is so much more than learning an instrument. Whether you’re a music student or not, there are plenty of class options. Not only is there an array of classes, but the faculty also bring a direct, intimate and transcendent approach to the study of music.

In the midst of his worldwide “True Colors” tour, the Grammy Award-winning international DJ Zedd marked his return to Los Angeles with a sold-out show at the Staples Center Friday night.
If you have ever jammed out to a Zedd song I bet you have experienced a fleeting moment of synesthesia. At least, I know I did. The intended goal of each of the tracks of the 26-year-old musical phenomenon Anton Zaslavski, is to transport listeners to a place where color, feelings and sound fuse for a short moment. And, never has he hit the nail harder on the head than with his headlining concert tour launched in support of his sophomore studio album True Colors, which dropped May 18.
The tour is on track to gain up as much publicity as the album at this point, considering the amount of special guests that are bound to show up for his sets. So far, Zedd has hosted The Chainsmokers, Benny Benassi, DVBBS, Audien and 3LAU, but Friday night’s guest might be the biggest of the tour. Steve Angello, a former member of the Swedish electronic trio, Swedish House Mafia, stopped by to perform an amazing set to a sold-out crowd. Only the presence of one third of the trio was enough to take me back to their farewell concert, “One Last Tour.” Though there is still some speculation over who will be Zedd’s next special guests, Friday night was most definitely a treat.
Between the ridiculous stage production, Zedd asked the crowd, “Los Angeles, are you ready?” before opening up the party with “Beautiful Now.” At one point, the audience chanted, “ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba-pa ba-ba-ba ba-pa…” as he performed his latest single. He incorporated colorful lasers, kaleidoscope illusions and smoke that filled the Staples Center when the beat dropped and made me feel as if I was transported to Coachella’s Sahara Tent, a tent that is its own world. Yet, I did not find the visuals nor the pounding beats the most beautiful aspects of the show. What I found most beautiful was the diversity of the audience. Next to me stood two twenty-something girls’ who were dressed in glitter, face paint and sparkly bustiers. Behind me, sat a mother with her two teenage sons who clearly wanted to leave as soon as possible. In front of me where three middle-aged women carrying large purses who had clearly left work early to enjoy the show. Essentially, the audience consisted of people of all different ages, attitudes, and colors.  As I stood alone in the raving crowd, I stopped and realized the people around me did not seem to have anything in   common, and I loved it.
For the next two hours, L.A.’s partyphiles waved multi-colored light sticks. Personally, I am not a big fan of these, but they definitely enhanced the moment. Zedd performed his chart-topping hits “I Want You To Know,” which features Zedd’s former girlfriend Selena Gomez on the vocals, “Clarity” and “Spectrum,” both which are featured in his 2012 debut album. Aside from his original tracks, the Russian-German DJ also remixed other popular party songs including Clean Bandit’s “Rather Be,” Coldplay’s “A Sky Full of Stars” and Magic’s “Rude.” Zedd’s personal take on these hits is on point. I can easily picture myself driving through the I-10 jamming to his remix of Bastille’s “Pompeii,” which was my personal favorite and a crowd pleaser as well.
True Colors is a catchy and accessible album with sounds that could possibly open the door to a new style of electronic music and appeal to the general public to break through on pop radio. Of course, Zedd has gotten a good amount of love from his electronic music buddies. But the fact that he is making electronic music more “musical,” is the characteristic that separates him from most electronic acts.  Many artists focus on creating tracks that will make party-goers bounce and dance. Basically, go crazy. But Zedd is mainly interested in crafting well-developed melodies, in melting sounds and textures.  Zedd’s songs do not follow the conventions of electronic music, and even when he’s playing live, he takes a step to make his concerts a different experience from his albums. You can find pictures and videos from the event, yet they will barely do the live production justice — but it will have to do.
The North American leg of Zedd’s “True Colors” tour continues through October.

The first season of Black-ish, starring Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross as married black couple Dre and Rainbow Johnson trying to raise their four kids, captivated viewers and brought in amazing ratings for ABC. Anderson and Ross’s chemistry was on point, and each episode brought more laughs than the previous one. Viewers should expect to see more of Dre trying to instill what it’s like to be black in America with disastrous yet hilarious results.
How to Get Away with Murder (Sept. 24, ABC)
Viola Davis gave an outstanding performance as Professor Annalise Keating, winning the People’s Choice Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for “Best Actress.” The first season of this crime drama ended with Frank being revealed  as Lila’s killer and Rebecca dying. Press releases for the second season have said that Rebecca’s killer will be revealed, but not to every single character on the show, which shows great potential for another juicy plotline.
Jane the Virgin (Oct. 12, CW)
After a positively reviewed debut season, with Gina Rodriguez (Jane Villanueva) winning the Golden Globe for “Best Actress” for her role, fans are looking for another hilarious yet dramatic second season. The big speculation is when Jane will get her son Mateo back from Sin Rostro, and secondly, which man she will marry. Will it be Rafael (Justin Baldoni), the father of Jane’s child, or Michael (Brett Dier), Jane’s scheming ex-fiancé?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians (Sept. 20, E!) 
Love them or hate them, you can’t get away from them — the Kardashian-Jenner family has taken over practically every aspect of the entertainment world. Caitlyn Jenner’s docu-series I Am Cait wrapped up last week, and the spin-off series Dash Dolls will premiere around the same time as the eleventh season of KUWTK. In this season, fans should definitely expect to see a lot about Kim Kardashian’s second pregnancy with husband Kanye West, but there are also some big question marks that loom over the premiere. Khloé Kardashian and James Harden are still a big mystery. And now that Kylie Jenner has turned 18, she and rapper boyfriend Tyga have been very public about their relationship – will that get any air time? But the biggest speculation is whether Scott Disick will be returning – he and Kourtney ended their decade-long relationship, which resulted in three children, in July. While neither party has released an official statement, rumors that Disick’s drug and alcohol issues, as well as a possible affair were the cause of the split.
Empire (Sept. 23, Fox) 
Empire was a surprise hit for Fox, as the musical-drama received critical acclaim, brought in stellar ratings, and was the talk on Twitter every Wednesday evening. The second season is looking to bring an even bigger bang than the first, with a slew of famous stars lining up as guest actors: Chris Rock, Kelly Rowland and possibly Mariah Carey, among many others. The show’s return will continue with Lucious (Terrence Howard) still behind bars, trying to figure out who snitched on him for killing Bunkie. Meanwhile, his three sons are still battling for control of his record label, Empire, while Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) keeps on slaying every second of screen time she appears in.
The Vampire Diaries (Oct. 8, CW)
After the shocking announcement that Nina Dobrev, who plays main character Elena Gilbert, was going to be leaving after the conclusion of the sixth season, viewers were in limbo. After all, Dobrev was the main character of the show and played an integral role in the plot. Things got more complicated with the announcement from Candice Accola, who plays Caroline Forbes, that she is expecting a baby. However, Accola has confirmed that she will still be on the show amidst her exciting news, and that her character will, in her words, “get her bite back.”
Gotham (Sept. 21, Fox) 
The 21st century revivals of the Batman series have been widely acclaimed, from Christopher Nolan’s brilliant Dark Knight film trilogy to the upcoming Superman vs. Batman film. Gotham, however, has been a pleasant surprise, with The O.C. alum Benjamin Mackenzie giving a spectacular performance as James Gordon, one of the few honest cops in the corrupt city of Gotham. The first season was a hit and mainly focused on the heroes of Gotham, whereas the second season looks to turn the tables and center around the villains. Cameron Monaghan is set to play “Jerome,” better known as the Joker, but his character will be causing chaos behind bars at Arkham Asylum, not running around the streets of Gotham as Heath Ledger’s famed portrayal did in The Dark Knight.
The Walking Dead (Oct. 11, AMC) 
The zombies are back and, this time, the show’s creators are looking to expand the show by adding remixed material from the original comic series, as well as providing flashback backstories for some of the characters. New cast members have been added and the sixth season is going to be split into two parts, with the second half premiering in February.
American Horror Story: Hotel (Oct. 7, FX)
Everyone’s favorite horror series is back and looking to return with a bang after the departure of longtime favorite Jessica Lange. Lady Gaga is making her acting debut as the Countess, the owner of the mysterious and demonic Hotel Cortez. In addition to Gaga, we will be seeing some other new faces, such as Max Greenfield, Naomi Campbell and Darren Criss. This season looks to do two things, in addition to terrifying everybody. First, have a true ensemble cast. It is hard to deny the past three seasons have been based around Lange’s characters, who viewers deemed as all being selfish, murderous women trying to retain their youth. Hopefully, AHS will return to its ensemble roots that were planted in the first season.
Scream Queens (Sept. 22, Fox) 
Ryan Murphy’s new comedy-horror series has been receiving quite the buzz, as the YouTube ads have been playing for weeks – however, they’ve done their job by successfully spiking viewer interest. Murphy is looking to combine the humor of Glee and the terror of American Horror Story with an all-star cast including original Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis, along with Emma Roberts, Lea Michele, KeKe Palmer, Abigail Breslin, Nick Jonas, Ariana Grande, Skyler Samuels, Glen Powell, Diego Boneta and more. The premise of the show is at the fictional Wallace University; Roberts plays Queen B*tch Chanel Oberlin, the President of the Kappa Kappa Tau sorority, who is forced by Dean Cathy Munsch, portrayed by Curtis, to accept anyone who wants to become a pledge. There’s just one problem – someone dressing up as the school mascot, the Red Devil, is wreaking havoc and murdering just about anyone who gets some screen time. The show looks to run as a classic “whodunit” murder mystery, as well as provide some great humor.

On Saturday, EVK opened an hour earlier as a response to student and parent requests for longer dining hall hours.
Associate Director of Hospitality Erik Russell said that EVK will open at 9 a.m. instead of its previous time of 10 a.m. on the weekends for the rest of the school year. The Parkside dining hall will still open at 10 a.m., and Café 84 will remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays.
Johnna Kosnoff was the first to raise the question when her son, Kyle, mentioned the dining hall hours in conversation. Kosnoff posted in a Facebook group for parents of USC freshmen, asking if this was a concern for anyone else.
“I didn’t want to start off his career at USC by complaining,” Kosnoff said. “But it worried me. It seemed like a long time to go without eating, especially for kids who do wake up early on the weekends.”
Other parents responded, telling Kosnoff that they shared her concerns. The group decided to contact the administration through a suggestions outlet on the USC website.
Fellow parent Nancy Bertschy also called Russell directly and received an email reply that explained the difficulties that Hospitality faces in keeping longer dining hall hours.
“They were extremely open to the suggestion, and mainly they emphasized that they had been keeping hours based on what student needs had been in the past,” Bertschy said. “I just think it’s best to operate on what’s best for student needs now, not in the past, and I know this is a problem for many of these students.”
This isn’t a new topic for Russell, or for Student Body Vice President Jordan Fowler. Last year, Fowler conducted a survey with over 370 undergraduate students to examine their dining needs. She sent the survey to Hospitality, suggesting that they review some of their hours for the upcoming 2015-2016 school year.
“Getting something to eat is a logistical problem for many students, and it’s something that we want to prioritize,” Fowler said. “I think we can agree that it’s impossible to provide for 100 percent of student needs, but we can at least attempt to respond to what we’re seeing.”
Fowler pointed out that comparative schools such as UCLA, Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley provide dining options until 2 a.m., and Carnegie Mellon keeps one hall open until 3 a.m. Her survey reported that 48 percent of students would prefer dining halls to be open later on weekdays, and 29 percent would like them open earlier on the weekends. It also showed that 59 percent of students would be willing to pay more for later dining hall hours.
Though Fowler is pleased with the recent adjustment in times, she hopes to see Hospitality also respond to the student need for later dining hall hours illustrated in the student survey. Parents such as Bertschy and Kosnoff agree that later dining hall hours would be beneficial. Russell, while unable to start a conversation on that topic this school year, hopes to be able to continue to adapt to student needs in the future.
“We always do the absolute best we can to serve our students,” Russell said. “We always want this to be a win-win situation. Our budget is set for this year, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t open to something later on down the road.”

“I’ve built one of the most successful PR firms in the business through innovation and experimentation. I’m looking forward to applying that same innovative approach at a prestigious school like Annenberg,” Cook said.
Others at Annenberg also appreciate the new insight Cook can bring to the position from his experience at Golin.
“This is the first time USC Annenberg has had an active CEO as center director,” School of Journalism Director Willow Bay told USC News.
Cook said his international experience will aid him in his capacity as director.
“I have worked with some of the biggest brands in the world like Walmart, Nintendo, Toyota and McDonald’s, and some of the most famous CEO’s like Jeff Bezos, Herb Kelleher and Steve Jobs,” he said, “And I have learned a lot about public relations in the process. More importantly, I have been fortunate to have traveled all over the world to places like Afghanistan, Iran and Syria, which has given me a valuable global perspective on different cultures and people.”
Cook is prepared to utilize his time in Los Angeles for both Golin and at USC.
“I’m accustomed to multi-tasking, and I love spending time in Los Angeles, where I used to live and still own a home,” Cook said. “Plus, the Golin L.A. office is just three metro stops on the Expo Line from USC.”
In 2014, Cook authored Improvise — Unorthodox Career Advice from an Unlikely CEO, in which he discussed his experiences as “a cabin boy on a Norwegian tanker, a doorman at a five-star hotel and chauffeur for drunks.” Cook said his interactions with college students during speaking engagements motivated him to take the position.
“Since my book was published, I’ve spoken at dozens of colleges around the world. Through that exposure, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the pressures students are facing and the dreams educators are striving to fulfill. I hope to play a meaningful role in this important work,” he said.
Golin founder Al Golin said USC will benefit from Cook.
“His new relationship with USC Annenberg offers him another interesting challenge, which will allow everyone at USC Annenberg and Golin to benefit from his vision and leadership,” Golin told USC News.
Cook hopes to serve as a connection between academia and industry.
“A big part of my job will be connecting the school to the PR industry,” he said. “Because I run a large PR agency, I will be able to leverage more than 30 years of experience to build relationships for our students. On the flip side, being surrounded by brilliant faculty members who are experts in every form of communications will allow me to bring innovative new ideas and research to professionals working in the field. I think it will be a win-win situation.”
Cook  said he is excited to begin his work with the University.
“I think USC has one of the best PR programs in the world. I’m really impressed with the faculty, the vision and the ambition. I’m proud to be part of it,” he said.

If you believe in small moral victories, I certainly don’t — USC’s loss to Stanford had a few. It is clear Steve Sarkisian’s decision to turn playcalling decisions over to Clay Helton was a shrewd move.
The offense looks more explosive and efficient than when Sark was doubling his duties as head coach and playcaller. Additionally, senior Cody Kessler has progressed as a leader and quarterback. When USC had the ball, which was unfortunately sparingly against Stanford, Kessler looked comfortable, hitting his targets with pinpoint accuracy.
He stepped up in a big game, which is a major improvement over last season. Unfortunately, two USC drives were stalled by key penalties called on veteran leaders, but that is out of Kessler’s control. Overall, Kessler and the skill position players put together a great game.
If there was one complaint on offense, it would be why the Trojans didn’t run more in the second half after gashing the Cardinal in the first.
Rushing the ball only six times over two quarters, especially when your defense is getting pounded, doesn’t really help the team overall. However, I’m sure if the Trojans weren’t stalled on those two drives, the six rushes would be a moot point.
What isn’t moot however, was the absolutely atrocious defensive game plan put together by coordinator Justin Wilcox. Not only did Saturday not qualify as a moral victory, it was an abysmal loss as it signified a woeful inability by the coaching staff to change and adapt in adverse situations.
Saturday’s loss was more of the same for the Sark era, in terms of the Trojan defense getting absolutely roasted time and time again without any discernible adjustments being made.
I’m not sure if it is arrogance, incompetence or blissful ignorance (or some combination of the three), but it seems that the Trojan defensive staff watches a different game than everyone else in the world.
It would be one thing if this was a one-game fluke, but we have an entire season of evidence to prove otherwise. What happened on Saturday shouldn’t be a surprise to any Trojan fan. It was the same story last year against Boston College, Arizona State and UCLA.
In what is a recurring nightmare for any fan, the Trojan defense refused to blitz and instead got picked apart by another opposing offense, turning Kevin Hogan into a dead ringer for Andrew Luck. The same thing happened with Tyler Murphy, Michael Bercovici and Brett Hundley. Wilcox is the fairy godmother of college football.
When they play USC’s defense, serviceable — but not great — quarterbacks magically transform into a mutant combination of Joe Montana, John Elway and Vince Young
No one should be mistaken about this Stanford offensive system.
It is no run and gun high octane aerial attack. The Cardinal scored 37 points against Northwestern and University of Central Florida, scoring a combined four touchdowns in two games. They punched it into the end zone five times against USC’s defense, a group littered with five-star recruits.
Don’t get me wrong — there are some differences with USC this year. For one, USC doesn’t have the excuse of depth anymore. The Trojans had the chance to rotate in plenty of defensive linemen but for the most part chose not to.
When they did, the backups made plays, like Noah Jefferson coming up with a stout stop in the fourth quarter. Depth is no longer a legitimate excuse, neither is inexperience. Young players at Ohio State and Alabama seem to flourish, so the only possible difference there is coaching and player development.
The second difference is this secondary can actually cover receivers man to man.
Sure, they will get burned occasionally, especially with freshmen in the game, but that is to be expected. What is worse than a defensive back being beat one-on-one, is watching the opponent’s offense poke holes in the USC’s porous zone defense, especially when the opposing quarterback has enough time to write the next great American novel in the backfield.
So with more depth, and an improved secondary, why does Wilcox still refuse to bring pressure? The old maxim says, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
Well the Trojans defense was more than broken on Saturday night, and Wilcox is paid to fix that, yet he didn’t.
With the exception of bringing in linebacker Porter Gustin to pass rush on the first drive of the second half (which worked), there were no changes. So I’m absolutely befuddled as to what the coaching staff was doing on Saturday.
When USC did blitz, they did so from the outside even though Hogan had a bum ankle and could only run up the middle. The Cardinal aren’t Oregon — they don’t use the width of the field, so it might make sense to crowd the field in between the hashes. Yet, there the Trojans were — throwing predictable and infrequent blitzes out from the wide side of the field.
The sad thing is, Stanford didn’t even pound the Trojans throughout the game. Sure, they wore them out by the fourth quarter, but for the most part the Cardinal moved the ball by air and not on the ground. That is simply put, unacceptable.
This criticism is not to say I am an expert on the intricacies of defense at the collegiate level, but the problem is I honestly don’t think Justin Wilcox is either. If the Trojans gave up 41 points to Stanford, who play the game like it is 1915, how will they fare against truly explosive offenses?
What is going to happen when the Trojans don’t pressure a talented quarterback?
With Hogan looking like Tom Brady out there, I cringe at the thought of Jared Goff or Anu Solomon attacking the Trojans’ defense. USC will have more talent than almost every team they face, but the gap isn’t big enough to neutralize the coaching disadvantage the Trojans seem to have against quality opponents.
The season is still salvageable; after all Ohio State won the national title following an early season upset, but something has to change. Sark has shown the ability to adapt, by handing the reins over to Helton.
Now he must make an adjustment to the defense. Whether that is replacing Wilcox or instructing him to ratchet up the pressure it really doesn’t matter.
Sarkisian is in his second year, and the buck stops with him. Depth is no longer an excuse. Neither is having senior leaders commit unfathomably idiotic penalties.
He may be primarily an offensive coach, but at the end of the day if the guy he hires can’t run a defense, then ultimately Sark is culpable.
Something has to be fixed or it’s going to be another eight or nine win season, and a long, frustrating few years with Sarkisian and Wilcox at the helm.

I will add that Oregon will likely smoke SC in a tall glass bong on Nov. 21 at Autzen.
We all have that date circled on the calendar.  Should be fun.  I’ll buy Sark a drink
(or two, or three…) after the game.  “Fight the Fuck On!”
Hugh G. Reckshun
Oregon fan here.  Excellent column.  I watched that game on TV and
I was shocked at the inability of SC to pressure the QB.  At Oregon,
we have our own questions on defense, and with our defensive
coordinator.  Really well written column.
8 or 9 wins?  This writer is an optimist!
Or perhaps, David Shaw is the better coach and Sarkisian and Wilcox were just way out of their depth?  Perhaps 5 Star recruits just don’t play well together and most seem to be saving themselves for their eventual NFL careers.  It speaks volumes that USC fans can’t seem to admit that the other team was just better and that it must be some problem within that has ruined another perceived National Championship season.  ASU has a huge run offense and now a blueprint of all of USC’s MANY defensive weaknesses so Sarkisian better park a car at LAX so that he has a ride home on Saturday night/Sunday morning!
Amen, brother!

The men’s water polo team suffered its first loss Sunday afternoon at the hands of Stanford, 6-5,  in the semifinal match at the Kap7 NorCal Invitational in Palo Alto, California.
After being held scoreless in the first half and entering the break down 0-3, USC was able to make a comeback and entered the fourth period behind by only one goal, 4-3. They would eventually tie the game, but were ultimately unable to take the lead against the Cardinal, who pulled out the one-goal victory.
With the loss, USC was forced to settle for the third place game, where they would take on Cal for the second consecutive year.
In last year’s match, they fell to the Golden Bears, 11-10, giving them a fourth place finish. Results of the match were unavailable at press time.
The Trojans got to the semifinal match by crushing their opening two opponents in the NorCal Invitational Saturday. USC has 27-3 and 12-4 wins over Redlands and UC Irvine, respectively.
In their opening match of the tournament, the Trojans scored the 19 straight goals against Redlands while keeping them scoreless for the entire first half.
Fifteen different Trojans scored in the game, including the first career goal for freshman Nick Lavayen.  Redshirt freshman Chase Koplow led the scoring for USC with a career-high four goals, all coming in the third period.  Redshirt senior Mac Carden followed close behind with a hat trick.
USC then advanced to an afternoon match against No. 8 UC Irvine, during which they dominated its fellow MPSF rival.
In the first period USC jumped out to a 6-1 lead on goals from six different players. UC Irvine fought back in the second period and the halftime score was a 6-3 lead for USC.
From there, USC turned up the heat and was able to push through to a final score of 12-4.  The lone goal that the Trojans allowed in the second half was during the third period.
USC’s scoring was led by a hat trick from Luke Helton. Nine other Trojans scored single goals as well.
Sophomore All-American goalie McQuin Baron had a successful Saturday with 16 saves, 14 of them coming in the second game against UC Irvine.
After this weekend, the Trojans will get the chance to enjoy some home cookie, as they head back to  Uytengsu Aquatics Center to host a three-game home stand against a trio of MPSF foes.
They will face off against Long Beach State next Saturday, Sept. 26, and then will take on on Stanford and San Jose State the following weekend.

With Cornell College’s effort to abolish the submission of SATs and ACTs, it became one of the many universities to take a test-optional approach to college applications. Though Cornell College allows students to present themselves in the best light possible in order to gain admission, standardized tests allow for the most objectivity in a diverse applicant pool.
Many arguments have been made in regard to the skewed structure of standardized tests. According to psychologist Gerald Bracey, standardized tests only measure a small portion of what is relevant in life. Bracey said that other factors pertinent to success — including curiosity, enthusiasm and leadership ability — are not measured by standardized tests. Another allegation against standardized testing is its inherent discrimination against non-English speakers, students with special abilities and people of other minorities. This is due to the lack of accommodations for these students. These cases do present themselves as worthy dissent against the traditional admissions process, but statistics, such as grade point average and test scores, level the playing field between all students applying.
In his blog post on The Huffington Post, Brand contends that grade point average and course load difficulty contribute to indicators for motivation in a potential student. However, based on the diverse demographic across the nation, every high school is different. Every high school runs on different grading systems, class components, studying opportunities and environments. The only equalizing agent among the vast number of high school students coming from these settings is taking the standardized test.
Though it is appealing to be able to paint oneself in the best way possible for a dream school, it would simply be an unjust system. Frankly, admissions are not done by robots. It’s also not the Hunger Games, where the odds are not always in your favor. The admissions process is headed by subjective officers. Standardized testing offers the most objective insight into many components of a student’s eventual performance at school.
Brand fails to acknowledge the rudimentary skills test-takers can learn from the SAT or ACT. For example, as with most cases of standardized testing, there is a limited time frame to answer all questions. Students are trained to improve their time management skills. Additionally, standardized testing does, in actuality, allow for students to grow holistically because it is impossible to teach top-secret, mandated testing material. Teachers can allocate their focus for teaching other, more edifying topics in school for more dimensional students.
Perhaps the most important factor of standardized testing is the mentality it fosters. Almost based entirely on test-score reporting, the Chinese education system, according to the Program for International Student Assessment rankings, outranked Finland in 2009 in reading, science and math test scores. With China placing number one in the entire world, it is evident that an environment in which there is a larger emphasis on scoring well on tests allows for a better background in achievement.
Whether Cornell College’s new system will work or not is uncertain, but USC should definitely not adopt these new policies. Because there is a large, diverse population of students at the University, some of whom are from a Chinese background where standardized testing will stay firmly engrained in society, standardized testing will equalize all backgrounds and allow for introspection into a myriad of different traits a successful student must possess.

Cornell College joined a growing number of U.S. universities last week in dropping the SAT or ACT as a requirement in admissions. Given that studies show that the ability of standardized tests to accurately predict academic performance while in college is murky at best and discriminatory at worst, USC should reaffirm its commitment to diversity by leading the test-optional policy movement among top-tier schools and finally dropping its standardized test requirement for admissions.
Prioritizing standardized testing in university admissions disadvantages minority students — a demographic for which USC has promised to increase opportunities. Study after study has unearthed racial bias in the SAT and similar admissions tests. In the SAT, the critical reading and writing sections present concepts more familiar to those of white or affluent backgrounds. Jay Rosner, executive director of the Princeton Review Foundation, found that in the unscored section of the SAT, which pre-tests questions to be used on a future SAT, questions answered correctly by high-scoring test-takers — which tended to be white and of higher income — were used in future tests while questions that black students answer more correctly than white students were later thrown out of the scored section of the test. This process, according to Rosner, creates a cycle of persistent racial and socioeconomic bias.
These discriminatory testing practices have troubling implications for resulting diversity. According to psychologist Roy Freedle, black students score 100 points below white students of equal socioeconomic status in standardized tests. Thus, high-achieving students in standardized tests are disproportionately white.
Class also plays a big — arguably bigger — role in the inaccurate picture of intelligence presented by standardized tests. Higher-income students can hire tutors and attend SAT boot camps — a highly lucrative college admissions industry in which parents shell out thousands of dollars and students improve their scores by sometimes hundreds of points — while lower income students may scramble for resources to understand what the test is and how to take it, let alone individual strategies to succeed.
The success of tutors and boot camps calls into question the claim of standardized tests to be impossible to prepare for — and thus challenges the assumption that a standardized test can measure intelligence in a way that is not confounded by other variables.
That’s probably why standardized tests have proven to be an inaccurate picture of academic performance while in college. According to a study conducted by William Hiss, former Dean of Admissions for Bates College, those who submitted test scores to the university only had a .05 GPA difference compared to those who did not, and test submitters only had a .6 percent higher graduation rate than non-submitters. In short, the difference in academic performance was negligible.
If USC does not drop its standardized test requirement completely, it should at least reconsider its importance in admissions decisions. Through the National Merit Scholarship Program, USC is one of the few universities to offer half-tuition scholarships based only on PSAT scores. And while the University’s commitment to merit is commendable, it should reallocate these scholarships to apply to students more holistically in the admissions process.
Universities can no longer rely on the assumption that objective university admissions require standardized tests. For USC, it’s time for an objective university admission — the SAT is not working.

For decades, the SAT test have not just been used for admissions, they have also predicted which students would struggle and eventually drop out. With tens of thousands of more applications than spots available, how will USC pick the students that will succeed? Will your birth into a Trojan family be the only way in? Will the groomed students from the local area be the only way in?

Stanford rallied from a double-digit first half deficit to upset the No. 6-ranked Trojans, 41-31, handing them their first loss of the season on Saturday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
USC (2-1, 0-1), which lost its Pac-12 opener for only the third time in its last eight tries, jumped out to an early 21-10 lead behind a five-yard touchdown run on the team’s first drive of the game by senior Tre Madden and a couple of passing touchdowns from redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler to redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell Jr. and sophomore JuJu Smith-Schuster.
Stanford (2-1, 1-0), however, did not panic with fifth-year quarterback Kevin Hogan and the Cardinal offense accumulating 474 yards in total offense on its way to outscoring the Trojans 31-10 from that point on to secure the Pac-12 upset on the road and, for Hogan, the first win over USC in his career.
“Stanford came ready to play like we knew they would,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “They are an extremely well coached football team and came out and executed their game plan on a high level.”
Coming into the game as double-digit underdogs, Stanford snapped USC’s two-game winning streak in the two team’s Pac-12 rivalry and also gave it its fourth win out of its last five visits to Los Angeles.
With starting cornerback Kevon Seymour out, the USC secondary struggled to contain the Stanford passing game and Hogan finished the game 18-for-23 for 279 yards and two touchdowns. Kessler quietly posted a three-touchdown game, while going 25-for-32 for 272 yards.
The Stanford ground game also gave the Trojans defense trouble, accounting for 218 yards on the ground led by sophomore Christian McCaffrey who rushed for 120 yards on 26 carries. Fifth-year senior running back Remound Wright punched the ball into the end zone three times for the Cardinal, with two of them coming consecutively to give Stanford a 10-point lead early in the fourth quarter.
“We had them in situations, but we didn’t execute and we couldn’t get them off the field,” junior linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “They were able to make some long drives, [and] it was hard to stop them.”
The Cardinal trailed USC 21-17 late in the second quarter before Hogan marched his offense down in a two-minute drill that was capped with a 17-yard touchdown pass to fifth-year senior Devon Cajuste to give Stanford a 24-21 lead at halftime.
The Trojans forced the Stanford offense to a three-and-out to begin the second half and retook the lead after a one-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to Mitchell, their second connection of the game. Stanford, though would recapture the lead after a Wright touchdown with almost five minutes left in the third quarter and would never give it back.
“I thought we came out with good energy, got a stop and went down and scored, but we have to look at the tape and see what needs to be done,” Sarkisian said.
A 46-yard field goal by Stanford kicker Conrad Ukropina with 2:27 remaining made it a two-possession game and sealed the deal late in the game for the Cardinal.
The Trojans were especially hurt in penalties. The team was penalized eight times, which accumulated for 87 yards including a few in critical moments. Sophomore Adoree’ Jackson ran a kickoff back for a touchdown in the second quarter, but it was nullified by a holding penalty, to go along with a personal foul penalty by Smith-Schuster that sent the offense back to its own seven-yard line.
“Some drives we had some momentum but penalties killed us,” Kessler said.
The ball was also in the hands of the Cardinal for the majority of the game, wining the time-of-possession battle by almost double, 39:29-20:31.
“It hurt the rhythm a little bit,” Kessler said. “We have to capitalize when we do get possession.”
The preseason Pac-12 favorite, USC failed what was deemed its first true test of the season after handily beating its previous two Sun-Belt opponents by almost 100 points combined.
“Football is a humbling sport,” Sarkisian said. “Emotions can go from high to low quickly … We need to play football the way we’re capable of playing.”
After a three-game home to stand to start the season, the Trojans will look to rebound from the loss in its first road test next Saturday when they travel to Tempe, Arizona to take on Arizona State. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m.
