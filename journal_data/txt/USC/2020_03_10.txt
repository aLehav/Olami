When it comes to higher education, exclusivity is the name of the game. Students are encouraged to work hard to get into the “best” schools. The schools that are considered the best are the ones that are hardest to get into; that is, the most selective and the most exclusive. The difference between quality and accessibility becomes blurred, and this has become increasingly true at USC.
At the outset, students are ingrained with the idea that “exclusive” means “best.” This attitude pervades not only academia but how we live our social lives. It’s not enough just to want the people that want us; we want to be surrounded by people we are proud to be wanted by. It’s human nature. The hottest clubs aren’t letting everyone in, and neither is the best law firm or fellowship. The ideal is not simply to get in — it’s to be let in. It can be sad, but it’s true that a door means nothing if everyone can get through it.
This premium on exclusivity is not always a bad thing. It trims the fat and keeps organizations running effectively. It motivates students to be their best so as not to lose out on access. On the surface, exclusivity makes sense when it comes to academic organizations or business groups, where the focus is primarily on performance statistics. This reasoning becomes more flimsy when applied to service organizations.
The process of joining many of the service groups on campus is arduous and exacting. Many service organizations have acceptance rates lower than 30%, which doesn’t make a great deal of sense for groups whose primary objective is bettering the community. Wouldn’t higher acceptance rates be of service to that goal? The pursuit of being the “best” often gets in the way of the real mission.
As student organizations pursue lower numbers, they also become vulnerable to homogeneity in 
membership. Entirely student-run clubs at USC thus do not have regulations or specific guidelines when it comes to who they let in. Even when they do, there is little to no entity holding them accountable to whatever standard has been put in place. 
Acceptance doesn’t always come down to who has the best numbers. Sometimes a rejection simply comes down to personality differences. If an applicant doesn’t mesh well with their interviewer on a personal level, their application could be denied in favor of someone they vibe better with. As recruitment becomes more selective, the perception of a “culture fit” becomes a primary factor in whether or not an applicant is rejected.
In a lot of ways, this mirrors the professional landscape. Many 
workspaces are homogeneous. When we think of a group of engineers or stockbrokers, there’s an immediate schema that comes to mind: an archetype. This doesn’t come from 
anywhere; many work environments do look the same. Conscious or not, hiring may be a matter of who an interviewer is most “comfortable” with, and that often comes down to a question of “Who is the most like me?”
What’s special about student-run groups is that this doesn’t have to be the case. USC’s student organizations don’t need to be a pure reflection of the current workspace — they can be a picture of the ideal. There doesn’t need to be a dominating viewpoint or personality type in any space on campus. Students have the freedom to create spaces where difference is celebrated, under the like-minded pursuit of a common goal. Exclusivity is not the bridge to that difference, but the barrier.
In truth, there is no escaping exclusivity. The door will always have to close on someone, and we will always value the threat of being told “no.” Without it, a “yes” is worth nothing. There is not much that’s immediately enticing about a group that lets 
everyone in. It is a lesson most people learn in middle school. Additionally, there might not be much that is immediately worthwhile about letting 
everyone in. But, by widening the margins of acceptance, student organizations — and students individually — expose themselves to new perspectives and move away from the groupthink that threatens to deter progress.
Student organizations would do well to reevaluate their selection process to determine if low acceptance stats are really consistent with their goals. Perhaps students would all be better off if they stop viewing acceptance as something that must always be earned. Sometimes, it’s okay not to be so choosy.

With the recent release of the University’s Sustainability Annual Progress Report and the financial drama that has been the divestment issue in the past months, the University must consider aggressive sustainability measures for its upcoming 2028 Sustainability Plan. 
In its efforts to become a zero-waste campus, the University ought to outright ban plastic water bottle sales in restaurants and vending machines on campus. Tangible solutions like this can be effective in reducing plastic consumption and helping the transition to zero waste, especially as the University failed in meeting some measures of its Sustainability Annual Progress Report in 2019. 
The University was not able to decrease potable water use by 25%, but was able to increase awareness of conservation practices and implement audience-appropriate educational campaigns. In conjunction with Facilities Management Services replacing outdated water fixtures across campus, reusable bottle use should also be promoted by installing more refillable water stations.
By taking this initiative, USC can take an active role and take the lead in encouraging the local community and other universities to follow suit.
Not all students may have the financial means to engage in sustainable practices. The University should therefore also provide reusable water bottles as a way to consider all students in this policy change. This engages students with sustainability, and promotes positive habits that may genuinely have a lasting impact on the campus and in the community. Water resources and the energy to manufacture and transport plastic water bottles may be saved by discouraging plastic water bottle usage. 
Many colleges across the nation have implemented programs to curtail or outright ban plastic water bottle usage. From the Washington University in St. Louis to the University of Portland, these institutions have been able to lead the way in sustainable practices through their plastic water bottle bans. ​​By 2023, the California State University’s 23 campuses will be eliminating the use and sale of all single-use plastics including plastic straws, water bottles and bags. The College of St. Benedict in Minnesota has also installed 31 refillable water stations at a cost of approximately $20,000 that would be made back in a year due to the cost of bottles saved.
Other companies such as PATHWATER have student ambassador programs to encourage advocacy in favor of banning plastic water bottles on campus. In 2017, students at UC San Diego worked to pass a vendor lease agreement to eliminate the sale of plastic bottles upon a campus vendor’s lease renewal. 
In focusing on making tangible efforts to reduce USC’s footprint, the University can create lasting change rather than resort to financial theater to misconstrue what can actually be done. Choosing to ban plastic water bottles across campus may seem rigid, but it may allow the University to meaningfully engage in creating a culture of sustainability.
As the Sustainability Annual Progress Report in 2019 signaled, “With the support of our new president, we are making meaningful strides to expand sustainable operations.” President Carol Folt has in her hands the opportunity to effectively achieve the University’s goals and move toward sustainability.

Life is like the “Choose Your Own Adventure” book series. Let me explain why.
“Choose Your Own Adventure” is a series of children’s books where each story is written from a second-person point of view. The reader assumes the role of the main character and influences the plot’s outcome by deciding their actions and behavior.
During the ’80s and ’90s, this series was one of the most popular children books. Originally published by Bantam Books (now Random House), the books are based on the concept created by Edward Packard in 1976. Packard developed the idea from bedtime stories he crafted for his daughters which featured the character, Pete, and the adventures he went on. 
“I had a character named Pete, and I usually had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island,” Packard said in an interview with the Beaver County Times. “But [one] night I was running out of things for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do.” 
It was his two daughters who came up with unique paths for Pete to take as he ventured on, motivating Packard to build several endings for each path. Inspired by his daughters’ creativity and eagerness, Packard went on to apply his personal experience to his professional career. 
Though this style of literature is catered toward young children, his books invite people of all ages to be their own hero. Having the audience pick from three to four options every two or three pages for what the main character does fosters a deeper and stronger relationship between the reader and the protagonist. Breaking the wall between fiction and the real world, a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book transports readers into an alternative universe, allowing them to experience new worlds and situations. 
But, the greatest life lesson these books contribute is the simple yet profound truth that life is filled with adventures of your own choosing.  
When applying this universal principle to daily life, it becomes evident just how complex and difficult it is to live by this motto. Our thoughts, our actions, our beliefs, our quirks and, most notably, our values are highly influenced by various factors surrounding us. From a young age, teenagers face all sorts of pressure manipulating them to change their attitudes and decisions. According to a publication by Parent Further, 90% of teens surveyed said that they had been influenced by peer pressure. While peer pressure may not always be negative, this phenomenon significantly affects adolescent decision making.
And USC is no exception to this trend.
From small decisions like attending the Visions and Voices event of the week because “everyone is going” or eating at Parkside Dining Hall because it supposedly has the best food (even though EVK is only a two-minute walk from you) to larger decisions such as supporting a particular presidential candidate solely because they are the most popular, we all succumb to peer pressure. 
It is this societal constraint that builds the foundation of being easily swayed by those around you later in life, such as in your professional career or with your future family. We must all learn to stop making decisions based on the influence of others. Instead, we need to start making decisions for ourselves.
Though it’s more complex than that, I nevertheless underscore the importance of choosing your own path. I understand that decision-making is guided by several factors ranging from past experiences and cognitive biases to individual preferences and social circumstances. Yet, I believe that if we begin to prioritize being comfortable with making our own choices, we work toward creating our own real-life version of the books we loved to read when we were younger. 
Both you and I should start being our own heroes. It is up to you to choose your own adventures, write new memories and narrate your personal success. So, go out there and start chasing your wildest dreams because maybe one day they’ll turn into a reality. 
Ultimately you are your own protagonist in the story called life.

Fans trickled into The Satellite, a live music venue in Silver Lake, Sunday night for drinks with a side of stand-up comedy from Brandon Wardell’s monthly show  “Brandon Wardell & Friends.” Illuminated by a single disco ball and filled with blue smoke, the small venue was taken over by young comedy fans eager to immerse themselves in an hour of humor.  
Wardell did not disappoint. After coming out onto the stage the first time, Wardell proceeded to recreate his opening after it failed to meet his standards, returning backstage for a moment. The second time, he hit it perfectly. Taking the stage to “Let’s Get It Started” by The Black Eyed Peas, Wardell looked like he was walking onto the stage of a packed Honda Center.  He maintained the same high energy throughout the set.  
Patron Nicole Weckerlin, a longtime fan of Wardell and some of the other comics featured, said the show was “absolutely incredible,” as the humor brought tears to her eyes.  
“The lineup killed and this venue is so inviting … anything goes,” Weckerlin said.  
Wardell captivated the audience with every word, covering a range of topics from sex to relationships to Elizabeth Warren’s viral TikTok and even Harry Potter. But a large portion of his jokes were centered around the current political climate, an issue that Wardell has been particularly vocal about on social media. Wardell carefully crosses the bridge between politics and comedy. 
“I’ll talk about political stuff here and there, but never in a way that’s like, ‘This is the point that I’m making,’” Wardell said in an interview before the show. “I actually kind of like for there to be some moral ambiguity to what I do. I feel like if you go to like a standup show of mine, I don’t want you to necessarily be walking away with like, ‘Oh, these are all the literal points he was making.’ I’m just making jokes.”
Wardell’s audience appreciated the escape he provided through his political satire, as evidenced by the laughter that bounced off the low-ceilinged walls. 
“It’s real life,” Weckerlin said. “It’s just relatable, and it’s universal, and we’re all in it together is what comics consistently show to their audience.”  
Wardell also invited fellow comedians from across the nation to join him for the show on Sunday, including John Early, Hannah Einbinder, Jamel Johnson, Andy Haynes, Aaron Chen, the Sklar Brothers, Yassir Lester, Andrew Michaan, Chloe Fineman, Kurt Braunohler and Cory Loykasek. It was a lineup that Wardell was proud of.  
“It’s always just a bunch of my friends and people that I’ve picked to perform, who I can personally vouch for,” Wardwell said. “A lot of times … I’m performing in places I can’t, in good conscience, tell people to go because, you know, sometimes the lineup is going to be half people that I think are not funny.”  
The audience certainly did not find the humor lacking. For Antonia Reynolds, who usually comes to the show with her brother, the best laughs came from Einbinder’s standup. 
“I loved it — it’s fucking awesome,” Reynolds said. 
Einbinder was a last-minute guest, according to Wardell, and was on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” March 6. 
Wardwell said he specifically picked the lineup to include a mix of comedic styles. Each comedian took the stage armed with jokes from different niches. For Loykasek, it was being a 35-year-old man with roommates. Einbinder talked about drugs after telling the audience she was “high as hell.” 
The Sklar Brothers shared the stage as they brought it up a notch by cracking jokes about kids and family life. Laughs erupted from the audience when the identical twin brothers poked fun at their childless friends who treat their pets like kids. 
“It’s not a kid if you can tie it up and go have brunch,” Randy and Jason Sklar joked.
The comedians kept it casual when they were not on stage; wandering around the venue, lingering at the bar and interacting with the audience. Many of the guests in the audience, like Josh Kay, came out to support their friends who were performing. Kay and his group of friends came to The Satellite for Loykasek, who was the closing act of the night.  
Kay said he was particularly a fan of the relevant topics brought up by the comics, such as the presidential election.   
“I think topical newsworthy content is the most accessible at the moment,” he said. “There’s so much going on right now.”
Comedy shows similar to this one will continue to take place, according to Wardell, who said he has new projects coming up but was not ready to reveal them just yet. He will continue recording his podcast “Yeah, But Still” with co-host Jack Wagner, but emphasized his true love lies in standup.
As for his other passion?  
“Bernie Sanders and not Joe Biden,” Wardell said.

Springfest has been canceled due to concerns of the spread of coronavirus, according to a school-wide email from Provost Charles Zukoski. The annual University-affiliated concert, hosted by USC Concerts Committee, was planned to be held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum March 28.
People who purchased guest passes and pre-ordered merchandise will receive refunds, the committee announced in a statement released on its Instagram Tuesday.
“In accordance with University policy, we are sad to announce that Springfest 2020 scheduled for March 28 is canceled due to concerns regarding COVID-19,” Concerts Committee said in the statement. “We are proud to take the health and safety of our students seriously, and are grateful to all our partners, artist teams, and the LA Memorial Coliseum for understanding.”
All on and off campus University-related events, including performances and intercollegiate games, will be canceled from March 11 to 29, according to Zukoski. Springfest, which has traditionally been held at McCarthy Quad, had been looking to shift its venue to the Coliseum since 2017 due to increased attendance. 
This year, Concerts Committee also announced Springfest would include an additional stage for student talent and guest ticketing for non-USC attendees, in addition to extending Fryft hours to accommodate student transportation to and from the venue.
Concerts Committee, which had not yet released a complete lineup of the artists, announced early this month that student performers would include Kyle Lux, Ayoni, Ashes to Amber, Kid Hastings and Ayse. 
In the past, Springfest featured headliners such as Diplo, Trippie Redd, 2 Chainz, Sheck Wes, and Playboi Carti.
Springfest was previously canceled in 2017 amid hip-hop trio Migos’ performance as McCarthy Quad exceeded capacity, leading to trampling, the involvement of the Los Angeles Fire Department and a student’s hospitalization. 
Co-directors of Concerts Committee Leila Kashfi and Chris Begler said they are actively looking to bring back programming to the community this semester, should the circumstances change. Kashfi and Begler said the committee will redirect the Springfest budget to another program if University policy allows.

USC will extend online classes to one week after spring break as concern continues to grow regarding the spread of coronavirus, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Tuesday in an email to the USC community. The University has also canceled or postponed nearly all USC-sponsored events both on and off campus from Wednesday until March 29.
“We believe the risk to our students, faculty, and staff remains low, but it is our responsibility to you and our greater community to be proactive in our efforts to encourage social distancing as a means of preventing the spread of illness,” Zukoski wrote in the email. “At the same time, we are committed to continuing the academic excellence and vital work of the university.”
Beginning Wednesday, nearly all classes are transitioning online for a three-day trial period to evaluate the procedures the University has in place as USC aims to ensure a smooth transition. Adjustments will be made to the platform operations once the trial run has been evaluated over spring break. 
Residence halls, dining halls, clinics, libraries and recreational facilities will remain open throughout the duration of the online period and adhere to their usual spring break schedules, according to the email.
While athletic events on campus will continue as scheduled in the 18-day period, only the athletes’ families, media and recruits may attend. The matches will be streamed online for fans to view remotely. A similar format has been implemented for academic performances and recitals.
“This is a challenging time for all universities and organizations that bring together a large, highly mobile population, and we appreciate your patience and support as we navigate this uncharted territory,” the email read. “We ask for your patience and collaboration as we work through difficult issues related to the continuity of all of our academic programs.”
Currently there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus at USC. The University is continuing to monitor local and international developments. Los Angeles County reported its first case of community spread Monday after declaring a public health emergency last week. As of Tuesday, L.A. County has 20 reported cases. 
The University has continued to stress that students refrain from domestic and international travel. All nonessential University-related travel for students, faculty and staff has been suspended until March 29.
USC has encouraged students to refrain from returning to campus following spring break unless necessary. However, the shift to online will not include all classes, Zukoski told the Daily Trojan in a statement. Nonlecture classes like lab and performance-based classes will still be held in person. The University will continue to evaluate over spring break how it will manage such classes.
“We are moving as many classes as possible online,” Zukoski wrote in the statement. “We understand that not all courses can be taught remotely and therefore students should contact their instructors and remain flexible in this time of rapidly changing circumstances.”
Departments will decide the future format of nonlecture courses on a case-by-case basis. Chemistry lab coordinator Catherine Skibo sent an email to general chemistry students Tuesday evening stating that she had not received information about the online class transition beyond the provost’s email sent to the USC community.
“As far as I know, USC is not changing anything for this week; they’re just extending online lectures for the week after spring break,” the email read. “We are asking for clarification if that applies to labs the week after spring break as well.”
Adrian Guerrero, a sophomore majoring in chemistry, said some of his STEM professors have been taking the situation lightly, continuing to offer classes in person. 
“[A professor] basically said that since we are STEM majors, we should be able to analyze the minuscule threat of coronavirus and that we should help inform our non-STEM major acquaintances and colleagues,” Guerrero said. “This was several days ago, which also might be why the reaction was a little bit different.”
Faculty and students are still navigating the implications of remote classes. Arthur Auerbach, an associate professor of political science, said professors received the email informing them about the changes at the same time as the students and did not have any prior knowledge regarding the announcement.
“There’s always a point in time when the administration has to lead and I think this is probably one of them,” Auerbach said. “I imagine that there was some level of consultation with some percentage of the faculty, just wasn’t myself or others that I know within our department.”
Karen Mendoza, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she had a professor refuse to conduct class through Zoom and instead cancel it following the initial announcement; however, she has not yet heard anything since USC announced the extension. 
“[Online classes are] going to be a lot of teaching yourself stuff because I have one professor who was like, ‘I’m not going to be doing Zoom meetings and I’m not going to record myself because in class you guys look bored — I can’t imagine how bored you’ll be online,’” Mendoza said. 
This online shift follows more than 15 other universities’ transitions to digital platforms in the last week. Stanford University and the University of Washington were the first to do so Friday following an increase in cases in Santa Clara County and Seattle. All universities within the University of California system except UC Merced have suspended classes for the remainder of the quarter or will begin implementing such policies following spring break.

The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books has been postponed to October because of concerns regarding coronavirus, the Times announced Tuesday. The event, which has been hosted at USC for the last nine years, celebrates creative works through panel discussions and performances with authors, journalists, filmmakers and musicians and brings thousands to campus each April.
“Whenever we host the public at our events, we take health and safety seriously,” the Los Angeles Times wrote in a statement. “As we make plans to host the Festival of Books and Food Bowl in the fall, we will continue to monitor developments with the coronavirus in Southern California, and cross-reference with any guests who may be traveling to Southern California from affected areas to participate in our events.”
The move to postpone the festival follows several coronavirus developments in Los Angeles County, including the first case of community spread Monday. L.A. County declared a public health emergency last week after 20 cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the county at the time of publication. California has also announced a state of emergency following the first death in the state to receive federal and state funding to address the crisis.
The festival, which is going into its 25th year, will now be held Oct. 3-4. The 40th Book Prizes awards ceremony, which is typically held in conjunction with the festival, was canceled. Winners and honorable mentions, however, will still be announced April 17 as planned. The Times also postponed its annual Food Bowl, an event that features hundreds of L.A.-based food activities, including dinners, restaurant pop-ups and classes over the course of May, to fall.
USC has yet to comment on the postponement of the festival but has canceled or postponed other University-related events, including the weekly farmers market and the Latino Alumni Association Scholarship Gala. The gala, which was supposed to be held Saturday in downtown L.A., will now be held in May.
Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism professor and Media Center director Christina Bellantoni, who previously worked at the L.A. Times, has been a part of the festival in past years and has served as a moderator and panelist. Bellantoni was also supposed to be part of a panel this year and work on the L.A. Times Stage.   
“There’s a big economic impact,” Bellantoni said. “There’s hundreds of people who help staff it, who have to do the maintenance. Lots of preparation for having such a large thing on campus, but that’s the thing with any of these events that are getting canceled.” 
ReadersPLUS, a math and literacy tutoring program in Joint Education Program, annually hosts a booth at the festival where they read aloud children’s books and host a writing contest for elementary school students. Brittany Acevedo, a 2019 graduate and a volunteer in ReadersPLUS for five years, said she initially felt disappointed with the festival postponement but understood that the decision was necessary. 
“I don’t think there will be too much of an impact for it being moved to October other than [waiting] a little extra time,” Acevedo said. “In terms of the spirit of the community and the organizations that go with the [festival], I think there’s no hard feelings, it could be worse.
Festival of Books and Food Bowl are just two among several large entertainment-related events to be postponed or canceled because of the spread of coronavirus. The 2020 South by Southwest Innovation Awards, an annual film and media festival that several USC students planned to attend in Austin, Texas, was also canceled last week. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival will be postponed until October, the L.A. Times reported Tuesday.
The lineup of authors, performers and panelists will not be released until late August, L.A. Times Vice President of Communications Hillary Manning said in an email to the Daily Trojan. The L.A. Times will determine whether authors and performers who were scheduled to appear in April will be able to accommodate the date change. 
“We expect that the lineup will have some changes but are hoping many of the authors and performers will be able to join us in Oct.,” the email read.  
USC will conduct classes online Wednesday through Friday along with the week following spring break in response to the threat of coronavirus, and the University will continue monitoring the situation to determine any further necessary action.
This article was updated March 11 at 12:30 a.m. with interviews from individuals planning to participate in Festival of Books and with more information about the impact of coronavirus on the festival lineup.

If you go to any airport in the United States today you’ll come across people wearing masks to protect against COVID-19. Stanford University and the University of Washington have already transitioned to virtual classes as a precaution to prevent community transmission of the virus, with USC getting set to follow.
But go to a sporting event, and it’s largely business as usual … for now.
I attended the Los Angeles Wildcats XFL game Sunday and figured I’d have ample material for a story on fans’ concerns about coronavirus, especially given the news that a food vendor who worked the Feb. 22 Seattle Dragons game tested positive. So I set out to interview someone wearing a protective mask. I didn’t think it would be challenging to find interviewees at a game with 12,181 fans.
After circling Dignity Health Sports Park a good three times and walking up and down the stands, I failed to find a single person with a mask. 
Yes, the Wildcats’ stadium is an open-air venue, but that doesn’t change the fact that those 12,181 people were sitting, cheering, eating and drinking in close proximity. Moreover, the fans’ apparent lack of response to the coronavirus threat was an odd contrast to the widespread paranoia present on social media today.
Many runners at the Los Angeles Marathon exhibited a similar degree of nonchalance. More than 27,000 participants came from all 50 states and over 78 countries, so some were concerned the event could be a breeding ground for such a highly transmissible virus.
Despite all this, Frank Luna, a participant in the marathon, told the Los Angeles Times he wasn’t concerned about his health going into the race.
“I get it; it’s out there,” he said. “But we’ve had, what, one person die in California? I think I have a better chance of winning the lotto multiple times than getting it, and it’s pretty damn hard to win the lotto.”
Although it may be easy for some fans and athletes to brush off the coronavirus threat in favor of engaging with the sports they love, the implications of the virus to athletic competitions are serious.
Several major sports organizations are reconsidering how to keep their games going while preventing fans and players from getting sick. On Monday, the NHL, NBA, MLB and MLS issued a joint statement saying that they are closing locker rooms and clubhouses to the media. The NHL and NBA have advised their players not to shake hands with or accept gifts from fans after games.
The empty-stadium measure has also been a concern for fans of NCAA basketball as March Madness begins March 17. NCAA Chief Medical Officer Brian Hainline told the Wall Street Journal that the tournament will be played without spectators in the “worst-case scenario.” The NCAA is also considering cutting down the number of locations for the opening round games.
Although we live in a digital age where games are readily accessible on various streaming platforms, the in-stadium experience remains vital for many fans, especially for a once-a-year event like March Madness. Without fan presence at games, leagues won’t bring in nearly as much revenue and teams won’t enjoy the advantage that comes with having a loud home crowd.
Furthermore, these athletes are used to competing in front of a large crowd — take the fans away and you might get the energy of an informal scrimmage rather than a high-stakes sporting event. It might even be difficult to convince players to play in desolate arenas — after the NBA told teams that they may have to prepare to hold games in empty arenas, Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James told reporters, “I play for the fans. That’s what it’s all about. If I show up to the arena and there ain’t no fans there, I ain’t playing.”
The TV viewing experience would also change drastically, as broadcasts often excite an at-home audience with clips of screaming fans, and the occasional roaring of the crowd can draw a viewer’s attention to a great play.
In short, the implications are innumerable.
While the NCAA has not yet canceled its college basketball tournament, other major sporting events are on the chopping block. The BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., was supposed to begin Monday, but its organizers announced Sunday that they would be postponing the tennis tournament indefinitely.
“We are very disappointed that the tournament will not take place, but the health and safety of the local community, fans, players, volunteers, sponsors, employees, vendors and everyone involved with the event is of paramount importance,” tournament director Tommy Haas said in a statement.
For now, the 16 cases in L.A. County may seem to be an idle threat, hardly enough to wear a mask to a sporting event when you could be happily enjoying nachos or a beer instead.
But even if these events aren’t proven to spread the virus (at least not yet), the precautionary measures mandated by sports organizations could impact how games are played and consumed for months to come.

The No. 7 USC women’s lacrosse team continued its perfect start to the 2020 season with a 16-9 home win over Cal Sunday afternoon. 
USC was led by senior attacker Izzy McMahon, who finished with 5 goals on the afternoon — tying a career-high — after a frustrating performance in Friday’s win against Stanford in which she picked up only 1 goal on five shots. 
Head coach Lindsey Munday was impressed with the way McMahon performed and with her ability to bounce back against Cal just two days after the Stanford game. 
“Really proud of her for being able to step on the field today and put the past behind her, step up and take the opportunities she had, which was awesome,” Munday said. “It’s hard getting out after a bad game and not focus on it.”
The Trojans kept the Golden Bears at bay most of the first half before McMahon tallied 3 goals to start the second. McMahon credited her success to her relaxed mindset coming into Sunday afternoon’s game. 
“I just wanted to play loose and forget about whatever happened on Friday,” McMahon said. “Our mentality this year has been next play, letting go of the things that happened in the past and just focusing on the present.”
USC saw a strategy it hadn’t seen this year from Cal on the defensive side as the Bears tried to press the Trojans on the edge of the arc. McMahon spoke to how the Trojans adapted to the new defense and were able to grab 16 goals despite it. 
“We are playing ‘SC lacrosse,” McMahon said. “We changed up our offense a little but just working on coming off the pick, coming off the screen and attacking right away. With us, our go-to is quick ball movement. I think that’s what broke down the defense the best way possible.” 
Not only did the Trojans thrive on the offensive end, but USC also put on a clinic defensively to hold Cal to only 2 goals in the first half. For the fifth time this season, USC kept its opponent’s scoring total in the single digits. 
Junior goalie Riley Hertford finished with 10 saves and three ground balls as USC held the Golden Bears in check most of the way. Senior defender Natalie Byrne spoke to how the Trojans were able to lock down California in the first half. 
“We have been practicing really solid together,” Byrne said. “We pride ourselves on our defense. We are a family out there, we never get on each other, it’s always positive.”
With 4 of the 9 goals on the afternoon coming from free position looks, it was tough for the Trojans to limit Cal’s open opportunities in front of the cage. Bryne spoke to how the defense is always coming together to try to do more to help their goalie.
“After those 8-meters, we need to bring it in and say, ‘Hey, those calls aren’t going our way, this is what we need to do,’” Bryne said. “It’s a bummer for Riley to put her in that position. We never want to put her in that position, so we always talk about it afterward.”
While the Trojans were stellar on the defensive end, they struggled with the draw controls against the Bears all afternoon as Cal won the battle at the draw circle 15-12. Munday spoke to how the draws will be a point of emphasis for the Trojans moving forward. 
“It’s an area of focus that we need to work on as a team, get better at and just continue to compete,” Munday said. “It’s still trying to figure out the circle people, our draw takers. And every game is different with that, but we just have to improve in the area.”
USC took an 11-point lead with 11:46 left in the contest and got its bench into the game. Munday said it was important to get underclassmen playing time against the Bears this weekend. 
“Every single person on this team battles so hard in practice and competes in practice,” Munday said. “It’s awesome to see [freshman midfielder] Caroline Cheetham score her first goal of her career today for all the hard work that they put in.”
The Trojans will face the 5-3 Arizona Sun Devils on the road Friday at 1 p.m. as they look to continue their perfect start to the season.

If the -10 run differential was all college baseball fans knew about the Trojans’ weekend against then-No. 22 TCU, No. 2 Vanderbilt and No. 6 UCLA, they would’ve thought the three-game set went as expected for the unranked USC team. 
But that figure doesn’t tell even half the story for a Trojan team that preceded a loss to the Bruins with a pair of 2-1 statement wins over TCU and last year’s national champion Vanderbilt in the Southern California College Baseball Classic at Dedeaux Field. 
“All we’re trying to do every time we go out there is just earn some respect,” junior lefty John Beller told the Daily Trojan after Saturday’s win over Vanderbilt. “We get disrespected every year here at USC, and we’re just trying to go out there and prove some people wrong this year.” 
Beller put himself in a position to talk by hurling 8-plus innings against the defending champs. After allowing a leadoff blast to sophomore center fielder Tate Kolwyck on the game’s first pitch, Beller was in full control and only allowed one more hit the rest of the game. 
Beller has allowed just 1 run in his last 15-plus innings across two starts.
“I’m feeling phenomenal,” Beller said. “Just trying to keep the ball down, work with all my pitches, let the defense work behind me. Not trying to do too much, stay in the zone … [Head coach Jason Gill] came out in the eighth inning and he said, ‘This is your game if you want it. There’s no reason I’m gonna take you out of this ballgame.’”
Pitching was the formula for USC through the first two games of the weekend. Junior righty Kyle Hurt turned in six innings of 1-run ball against the Horned Frogs to kick off the weekend Friday. 
Hurt bounced back from a tough three-inning, 5-run outing against Seton Hall a week prior by striking out nine batters and allowing just three hits on the evening. 
“I was just going out there and just throwing every pitch with intent,” Hurt said in a Twitter interview with USC Baseball after the game. “Just trusting my stuff, knowing that I’m just gonna get a ground ball and just get a strike or get an out. And that’s what I did the whole entire night.” 
Neither of the wins came without a little ninth-inning scare for USC, though. In both games, the visitors put the leadoff runner on and advanced him to third with two outs. In both games, graduate two-way player Ben Wanger kept him there.
“I tend to just focus on my breathing,” Wanger told the Daily Trojan about the big situations. “Especially when we’re up against a really good team … Just focus on executing pitches.” 
The Trojans did just enough at the plate to get the job done. Solid performances by juniors third baseman Jamal O’Guinn and shortstop Ben Ramirez on Friday and Saturday, respectively, helped the two combined for three RBI knocks and eight of USC’s 15 total hits in the pair of victories. 
The deciding hit in Saturday’s game came off the bat of sophomore first baseman Clay Owens. With the bases loaded and two outs in the seventh inning, Owens worked a full count before rocketing a comebacker off the foot of junior righty Tyler Brown. The ball skidded into foul territory near the Vanderbilt dugout ­­­— an unlucky break for the Trojans on what would’ve likely been a 2-run single had it found its way up the middle. 
Beller and Wanger made sure it didn’t matter. 
“I think hitting’s gonna come and go, especially with the pitching staffs that we’re facing this weekend,” Gill told the Daily Trojan. “When you’re playing this caliber of baseball, you are going to be in 1-run games. The ball kind of fell for us today a little bit, and we got one more run than they did.”
Whatever magic the Trojans had in the first two games, it didn’t seem to be there Sunday. UCLA made sure USC wouldn’t leave with a weekend sweep, piling on 15 runs and 19 hits in a 12-run thrashing. 
Redshirt sophomore lefty Alex Cornwell was tagged for seven hits in 4.1 innings, allowing 5 total runs — though only 2 were earned. 
Of the 15 runs UCLA scored on the game, 9 were unearned. USC made five errors in the game. 
Owens added a 2-run shot in the weekend finale, but it came after the Bruins had already put up 3 runs in the opening frame. It was one of just four hits for USC. 
Owens brought his season slugging percentage to .604, the highest of any Trojan with at least 10 at-bats.
Despite the loss, though, the Trojans will head into a Tuesday 6 p.m. home matchup against 5-9 Xavier with plenty of confidence after taking down one elite and one solid team over the weekend. 
“No one really has a lot of respect for us,” Hurt said in the same Friday interview. “So we’re just gonna keep proving people wrong and keep winning big games.”

COVID-19, colloquially known as the coronavirus, has taken the world by storm. It has disrupted lives around the world like almost nothing that came before it. On college campuses, study abroad programs and spring break trips have been canceled, large group gatherings have been suspended and, soon, classes may transition to being virtual only. 
The most fearful aspect of this new virus is fear itself: It’s the unknown nature of the virus, its rapid infection rate and its unidentified cure that’s been causing the media frenzy and global panic that’s tanked the stock markets. 
I am hopeful that we will overcome this frightening period. Whether medical professionals develop a vaccine or successful quarantines effectively prevent the virus’ spread, the world will get through this. Of course, it won’t be without a cost. Previous worldwide pandemics in recent memory, including the Zika, Ebola, Spanish flu, and the 2009 swine flu killed millions of people in total.  
There are a few lessons we’ve already learned from the outbreak. First, we must unite. Ordinary reason would hold that a common enemy unites those who wouldn’t otherwise be allies. The current response to coronavirus hasn’t completely affirmed that logic. While President Donald Trump has yet to declare the outbreak an emergency and call for a united response, even going so far as to call it the Democrats’ “new hoax,’’ opposing politicians have been quick to use the outbreak for political points. 
Candi Cdebeca, a city councilwoman in Denver, shared a since-deleted tweet that read, “For the record, if I do get the coronavirus I’m attending every MAGA rally I can.” And a New York State Assembly staffer shared a message on Facebook advising people to avoid Asian-owned businesses.  
The second lesson, specifically aimed at college campuses, is to rethink our illness policies.  
Professors must be more accomodating. In many courses, students simply cannot afford missing a day or more of classes, for fear of their grades dropping; in turn, they force themselves to attend lectures, consequently spreading illnesses to their peers.
The popular Instagram page “Overheard University” accepts submissions of quotes students hear on their campuses across the country. Last week, a professor’s quote from USC made the cut. According to the post, the professor said the following: “Only documented medical illnesses count for absences. I hear people are worried about the coronavirus and I don’t care. The only reason I want to hear for why you can’t come to class to turn in your paper on Thursday is that you were hit by a bus while reading about the virus spreading.” 
While there is no way to know whether this particular professor jokingly or seriously made this comment, the point still stands: The University must revisit its guidelines on excused absences. 
The Daily Trojan reported on Jan. 31 that the cinematic arts school would no longer distinguish between excused and unexcused absences in the spring semester, and that each absence would decrease a student’s grade by 10% after the second absence. On Feb. 2, the Daily Trojan reported that the University updated its attendance policy and allow exceptions for exceptional situations such as family emergencies. 
Putting aside the blatant intolerance of religious and familial obligations this rule brings to USC, the coronavirus 
outbreak shows logically why it’s simply a bad policy. Hopefully, the University realizes the absurdity of implementing online classes to promote student safety and forcing sick students to attend class to promote student discipline. 
In times like these, when the most we can do is maintain healthy hygiene and limit our contact with symptomatic people, our time is best used to consider future implications of this outbreak. In the meantime, for those of us on the receiving end of University and government directives, we ought to consider improvements to the way our society is currently structured. Because while this state of emergency will eventually attenuate, it exposes deep flaws in the community. And, as much as I hate to say it, coronavirus will not be the last of its kind.

It is a common sight: students packed into a lecture hall with the glow of laptop screens illuminating their faces as the sound of click-clacking keys fills the room. Students pay careful attention to each word and furiously type as the professor blasts through material that will be on the next midterm.
Seemingly just as common is the sight of students using their laptops during class to scroll through an abundance of social media sites, text friends or buy jeans that are finally on sale.  
Due to counterproductive technology use, it seems increasing numbers of professors have opted to implement laptop bans during class. There is no argument that students can get distracted, and that for some students, hand-writing notes is a better style of learning. However, professors should still allow students to be responsible for their own learning and should therefore not place unconditional bans on laptops in classes. 
Professors point to studies that show that hand-written notes help students retain more of a lecture than typing it on a laptop. This may be true if laptops are used only for note-taking. However, as professor Matthew Numer of Dalhousie University in Canada explains, laptops serve an alternative use in allowing students to submit responses and opinions about material covered during the lecture. After running surveys and focus groups of 1,100 students, Numer found that using an app on a laptop in this interactive way actually promoted undergraduate engagement. 
There are certainly times that laptops may not be appropriate in lectures. But there is no avoiding the fact that technology pervades daily life, and blanket laptop bans do not consider the ways that technology can be used positively. 
When professors implement class-wide laptop bans, they fail to accommodate students with disabilities. Morgan Polikoff, an associate professor at the USC Rossier School of Education, went back and forth with a ban but finally settled on allowing technology in the classroom. He argues that while exceptions are made for students with disabilities to use laptops, these bans often force them to be singled out in class. In fact, students with disabilities may be questioned by their peers as to why they get laptop privileges and others do not. This may cause unease and negatively impact their ability to learn. 
Additionally, students at USC are adults and therefore should have the freedom to make their own decisions. Students are spending their own time, energy and money to be at USC, and it is their responsibility to best utilize these resources. If a student wants to go to a lecture and spend time scrolling through social media rather than listening to their professor, that should be their own decision. Ultimately, students will feel the consequences of their own choices. 
Taking responsibility for one’s own learning is an important skill for students to take into the workforce. Instead of being told how to learn, students ought to figure out what’s best for them, often through trial and error. 
In the hit show “The Office,” Michael Scott, the boss of the paper company Dunder Mifflin, deadpans “When I discovered YouTube, I didn’t work for five days. I did nothing. I watched Cookie Monster sing ‘Chocolate Rain’ about a thousand times.” 
This is played for laughs, because of course no one would actually do something like that at work, right? However, life truly does imitate art; this past summer, an employee was fired from Robert De Niro’s production company in a $6 million lawsuit for allegedly binging the series “Friends” while at work. 
As the allure of technology and its distraction grows stronger, it is important for professors to allow their students to learn self-control. College is the time for students to practice how to resist the temptation of technology, rather than being instructed how to act. It is better to learn the consequences of misusing a laptop by getting a 
sub-standard grade on a quiz in college rather than  being fired in a multi-million dollar lawsuit later in life. 
If students think handwriting notes will improve their learning, it should be their decision, and their decision only, to put away their laptop. Laptop bans marginalize minority groups, disregard the benefits of technology and do not treat students as adults who are responsible for their own choices.

What with 2020’s pretty, uh, tense start — you know, coronavirus, election madness and the tragic passing of NBA star Kobe Bryant — it’s been a minute since I wrote a music-centered piece.
So when Lil Uzi Vert surprised his fanbase Friday by dropping his long-awaited and maddeningly delayed second studio album “Eternal Atake” a week early, I felt like it was fitting to ride the wave of excitement and take a moment to pay tribute to the project. A few months ago, frustrated with artists like Uzi and Playboi Carti with their empty promises about releasing their music, I wrote a column about how these long waits may actually be beneficial in serving as a clever marketing tactic to build intrigue and hype. 
Though it’ll take some time before a deeper analysis of the project’s impact can be properly assessed, I think I was right: It doesn’t seem like the two-year wait for “Eternal Atake” deterred fans at all. In fact, the highly anticipated album’s opener, “Baby Pluto,” was quick to dethrone Roddy Ricch’s “The Box” from No. 1 on the Spotify U.S. Top 50 Chart after it enjoyed a lengthy 12-week reign. All 18 songs on the album, besides the previously-released single “Futsal Shuffle 2020,” debuted in the top 20.
“Eternal Atake” is, first and foremost, a testament to the Philadelphia native’s unique skill and a reminder of his versatile artistry. The way I see it, while the ambiance of each of his previous projects — think “Luv is Rage 2” and “Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World” — felt distinctly guided by a particular feeling or vibe, EA is far more conceptually heavy, a kind of cheeky “Hey, look what I can do” from the shoulder-shimmying and eye-rolling rapper. Attentive fans quickly picked up that the 18-song project is evenly divided into three parts, each representing a different persona. First comes Baby Pluto, then Renji and finally Lil Uzi Vert himself, with six songs per alter-ego, lending itself to a dark but on-brand 6-6-6 structure. 
What do we know about the personas? Well, Baby Pluto loves to rap. The first six tracks bring out his arguably neglected trap side and feel reminiscent of the more abrasive “Luv is Rage” days. Renji, on the other hand, is flirty, fun and melodic; he offers us head-bopping jams like “Celebration Station” and “Bigger Than Life.” The last six numbers give us the classic “XO Tour Llif3”-esque Uzi we were all waiting for. The album’s multi-layered structure has led to speculation surrounding its underlying meaning and message; one fan tweeted “@LILUZIVERT The aggressive first half of EA represents the take off in the rocket ship and the second half represents flying through space geeked?” to which Uzi replied, “YESSSSSS!!!!!!!” Whatever the guiding force behind the concept of the project was, it is abundantly clear that Uzi has elevated himself stylistically while still managing to remain true to what made him so authentic and likable in his early days of stardom.
The project’s engineering deserves much recognition, too. Producers Oogie Mane, Brandon Finessin and Supah Mario make many expected appearances throughout, while the Chief Keef-produced “Chrome Heart Tags” adds a touch of spice, serving as a pleasantly surprising divergence from his reliable sound-mixing entourage. And, oh, the samples! “Prices” samples Travis Scott’s “Birds in the Trap” banger, “Way Back That Way” samples the Backstreet Boys’ biggest hit; and “You Better Move” samples the “Space Cadet” 3D pinball game from Microsoft Windows. In fact, “You Better Move” also references “Blues Clues,” “Zoom” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” all in one track: “Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh, you wanna duel? Blue-Eyes White Dragon, no, I will not lose.” We are treated to a continuation of “XO Tour Llif3” in “P2,” and what feels like a sequel to “The Way Life Goes” in “I’m Sorry.”
The album’s many references, callbacks and samples make for a very nostalgic ambiance while simultaneously underscoring a fresher, untapped vibe — a difficult balance to strike. In one record, Uzi brings us back to the good old days and encourages us to embrace the coming ones (and gives us a fire soundtrack to do it with, too). 
The kicker is this: “Eternal Atake” had so much hype that Uzi could have collaborated with any artist he wanted to. Instead, he gave us an hour of music with only one guest, as if dangling his confidence in his own artistry before our eyes. That doesn’t mean we’ll be deprived of collabs, though; Uzi teased a stacked deluxe edition boasting features with Future, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Young Thug and Lil Baby, along with some infamous leaks: “Lotus,” “Jellybean” and “Myron.” He said it’ll drop this week but, at this point, do any of us trust his alleged release dates?
There is a lot to unpack with this album, and I don’t even feel that I’ve scratched the surface . In my eyes, that overwhelming feeling is a promising indication that this is a substantive, three-dimensional project. The journey to “Eternal Atake” was riddled with delays and false starts, but it is finally here and you can feel that sense of euphoria reflected in the music. To me, Uzi’s work has always been the kind that grows on you with each listen and I expect nothing less from EA. Here’s to two years of waiting and a highly rewarding musical endeavor.

Spring is nearing and daylight savings time has given us an extra hour of sunlight, so whether you’re planning to hit the beach with your friends or find yourself sitting in traffic on the Interstate 405, take this list of listens with you and keep an eye out for some of this month’s most long-awaited releases. In the mix, you’ll find some powerful ballads and dance hits to fit your every mood from female artists in celebration of Women’s History Month. So pick up that aux cord, turn up the volume and start listening.
ALBUMS COMING THIS MONTH:
“Circles” (Deluxe) – Mac Miller
The deluxe edition of Mac Miller’s posthumous album, “Circles” is coming out this month, featuring an addition of two songs, “Right” and “Floating.” The release of “Circles” has been an emotional and heartfelt ride for fans as it digs deep into Miller’s feelings about life and his final works. The album, released in January, left everyone to imagine where the rapper was headed in his career and life while at the same time leaving people to appreciate where he was and what he left for the world as an artist.
“After Hours” – The Weeknd
The singer whose music combines contemporary R&B, funk and indie genres, is finally releasing his upcoming fourth studio album titled “After Hours.” The March 20 official release date comes only months after the singles “Blinding Lights” and “Heartless” were released in late 2019. The singles reflect a familiar sound, similar to his ominous 2012 compilation album “Trilogy,” which featured the songs “High for This” and “Wicked Games.”
“Before Love Came to Kill Us” – Jessie Reyez
Jessie Reyez, the Canadian singer-songwriter, is coming out with her debut album March 27. With more than 12 million monthly listeners on Spotify and her first Grammy nomination this year, the pop artist has worked hard to get to this point. It is fascinating to see what Reyez has accomplished thus far without ever having released a full studio album, such as getting scheduled as a performer on the now-postponed Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival 2020 lineup and collaborating with Eminem on his song “Good Guy” in 2018. While you wait for the release, you can listen to Reyez’s empowering single from the album “ANKLES,” a trap-like track with raw vocals from the singer. 
“Alicia” – Alicia Keys
After releasing a single from the project in January called “Underdog” and hosting the 62nd annual Grammy Awards earlier this year, Alicia Keys is set to release her next album March 20. Her self-titled seventh studio album will be followed by the release of her memoir “More Myself: A Journey” on March 31. As a classically trained pianist and powerful vocalist, we are likely to hear tracks with strong melodies and inspiring lyrics.

When professor Christopher Hawthorne isn’t teaching a small freshman seminar class at USC, he’s envisioning the future of the Los Angeles urban landscape. Working to modernize public spaces as the city’s first chief design officer, Hawthorne uses his expertise to teach students the importance of physical settings in shaping their writing.
Hawthorne began his tenure at USC in January as a professor of practice in the English department of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Alongside his position at City Hall, he teaches one general education seminar, “Writing About Place,” a course designed to teach students how to write about their personal surroundings.
Students in the course read plays, poems, memoirs and criticism by writers such as Joan Didion and Anna Deavere Smith, who use the theme of place to connect to memories and contextualize their subjects.
“It’s really helping students learn about how other writers in a variety of genres have approached this question of writing about place … and how they might bring that same attention to place to their own writing,” Hawthorne said.  
L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti appointed Hawthorne the city’s chief design officer in March 2018 to tackle issues of urban development, including lack of green spaces and affordable housing. Hawthorne said he utilized his architectural experience examining the design layouts of local communities to develop the course. 
“The same issues that the writers we are reading in the course are thinking about are also central to the work that I’m doing as we want all the design work we do to be appropriate to the places where it’s located,” Hawthorne said. “That can be a complex undertaking … how to advance the city-wide design ambition, but also have designs that are, again, really knit into the neighborhoods where they’re being built.”
Bobby Voong, a freshman majoring in business administration and Spanish, said Hawthorne’s class exposes him to the different communal and architectural issues facing L.A. He also emphasized the role Hawthorne’s professional background plays in the success of the class.
“He worked as an L.A. [architecture] critic for a long period of time, and now he has his own position in the mayor’s office,” Voong said. “It really helps the way he teaches because he’s really knowledgeable … He knows how to motivate students and allow us to see things from a different perspective.” 
Hawthorne also drew on his time as an architecture critic at the Los Angeles Times to hone students’ writing abilities. While working at the paper from 2004 to 2018, he assessed new building developments by prominent architects in the context of contemporary city design and evaluated the evolution of L.A. architecture.
“I would say, particularly in the last few years of my time at the L.A. Times, I was really focusing on Los Angeles itself as a subject and the ways in which it was trying to establish a kind of 21st century identity,” Hawthorne said.
Hawthorne’s experience analyzing the city’s design evolution led to his creation of the 3rd LA Project at Occidental College. The project hosts panels and commissions video essays on the history of L.A. urban planning and how experts should rethink the nature of future development.
“This is a city that has defined itself for much of the 20th century around the single-family house and the freeway and individual freedom and freedom of movement,” Hawthorne said. “We know that those kinds of basic building blocks of a city are not sustainable models for the 21st century.”
Hawthorne brings the 3rd LA Project with him to USC as a part of Dornsife’s Academy in the Public Square initiative, which connects faculty and scholars to industry leaders to collaboratively address complex issues such as climate change and the homelessness crisis.
Hawthorne said the possibility of partnering with the innovative initiative drew him to USC. The projects are currently planning two public events focused on sustainability for the fall.
Academy in the Public Square Executive Director Kate Weber said Hawthorne exemplifies the scholarly vision for the initiative, which emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration.
“He sits at such an exciting and interesting intersection of urban planning and design and sustainability and landscape architecture,” Weber said.
Weber also said that his unique perspective on the future of Los Angeles development fit with USC’s vision for the city. 
“[Hawthorne] was really a natural fit for Dornsife,” Weber said. “He’s a writer, he’s an intellectual, his ideas of the history and the future of L.A. are right at home in our academic community.”

Some professors expressed concerns about the feasibility of transitioning from in-person classes to online after USC announced it would test virtual software to hold lecture and seminar classes online this week amid concerns regarding coronavirus. 
The University decided to move classes online for a three-day trial period Wednesday through Friday. The announcement follows a Feb. 28 email to faculty requesting that all schools design continuity plans to prepare for the possibility of a shutdown due to increased virus spread.
Brian Bernards, an associate professor of East Asian languages and cultures and comparative literature, said his classes, which include a general education lecture and a general education seminar, will be relatively easy to translate into online format. However, he has had to adapt his lesson plans to the virtual platform, and the guest speakers he had invited to lecture Thursday will have to deliver their talks through Zoom.
“There’s going to be definitely a learning curve for many faculty who have not run classes in this way and weren’t expecting to develop curriculum that wasn’t necessarily developed with an online function in mind or a remote learning function in mind,” Bernards said.
Bernards said a longer period of virtual classes would not come as a surprise, citing the University of Washington’s Friday decision to move classes online for the remainder of the quarter. 
“I see it as a learning experience or something that I should be prepared to do and should try in the case that this goes forward,” Bernards said. “I don’t know what the likelihood is that classes will be moved online for the remainder of the Sspring … but I think we should be prepared.”
Bob Bailey, an adjunct lecturer in the School of Dramatic Arts, said the format of many SDA courses would make holding them online difficult. The school will allow performance-based classes to continue in person during the trial period, SDA Dean David Bridel told faculty after the University-wide virtual class announcement.
“I was a little bit concerned about it at first because of the nature of the classes that I teach and where we were in terms of midterm assignments,” Bailey said. “They’re acting and directing classes. They have to be conducted in person.”
Bailey said a more permanent switch to online classes would pose problems, especially for classes in SDA and other performing arts schools which might not be able to deliver content as effectively if classes are taught remotely.
“I would hope that the University would proceed cautiously in that area because …  especially in what I teach, we have advantages to being in person,” Bailey said. “But if, in their judgment, they felt that it was the safest thing for students, the faculty and the staff for the school to be shut down, that would be a judgment call on their part.”
Bernards said he was understanding of any delay in notice regarding the trial of remote classes, saying the spread of coronavirus was difficult to anticipate and the University was making changes as updates were released.
“I haven’t necessarily had a personal complaint about the amount of transparency,” Bernards said. “The whole situation around coronavirus is pretty fast-developing, and they’re also dealing with an administration and national response that’s then overly slow.”
Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo, a sociology professor, said she had practiced adapting her classes to a different virtual classroom program and said that while teaching on Zoom would be a difficult transition, she believes the trial is an important step in preparing for the possible spread of the virus.
“As a senior professor, I’m less agile with adopting new technologies, so privately I grumbled to myself, you know, and I’ve now spent some time and I’m getting up to speed with it,” Sotelo said. “But most importantly, I think it’s the right thing to do. It’s an important preventative public health measure.”
The online class trial has proved more challenging for professors whose classes had scheduled midterms Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. Some, like “Data Journalism,” have opted to postpone exams, while others have moved their assessments online. 
Bernards said the Zoom trial raised questions about the possible implications of continuing online classes after spring break. He said he was unsure about how he would teach his general education seminar without being able to ensure a distraction-free environment.
“For my large lecture course, of course, there’s a final exam that’s on paper that I don’t want to just submit out to the world,” Bernards said. “I’m still deciding, ‘How would I approach those types of assignments that it’s critical where students are there in person, where it’s on paper?’”
The University has emphasized that the move to virtual classes this week is a trial for a possible shutdown rather than a direct response to the virus. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California Wednesday after the state’s first death due to coronavirus was announced. More than 100 cases of coronaviruses to date have been diagnosed in California.
The Los Angeles County Health Department confirmed its first coronavirus case acquired by community transition Monday, bringing the county’s coronavirus diagnosis count to 19. Universities along the West Coast, including Stanford University and the University of Washington, have moved classes online for the remainder of the quarter.

Five USC student and alumni game designers will no longer travel to Austin, Texas Thursday after growing concern regarding the spread of coronavirus led to the canceling of the 2020 South by Southwest Innovation Awards. The students planned to present their game ASCEND at SXSW but the city of Austin canceled the festival Friday amid public health concerns regarding large gatherings.
“It was disappointing,” said administrative director Anastasia Barbato, a senior majoring in narrative studies and nongovernmental organizations and social change. “We thought of it as a good networking opportunity, and a good opportunity to meet with other people in the entertainment industry, and generally get our names out there.”
ASCEND, an interactive performance where actors portray mythological characters, was selected in the Student Innovation Award category at the 2020 SXSW Innovation Awards in January. The game uses Greek, Egyptian, Chinese and Mayan characters to portray modern issues such as environmental protection and gender parity and encourages the audience to interact with the narrative of the story through games and puzzles. 
“It’s mostly just a huge disappointment, you know, a lost opportunity,” said 2019 alumnus and creative director Jack McCarthy. “I think all of us are still hoping to be able to present somehow, if it [is through] digital, if it is through an application, so that there is still a chance that we can get this award.”
The team is currently waiting to hear from organizers about next steps. Dalmia said she does not know what will happen in the future. 
“We have no idea if we get a virtual pitch or a certificate for being a top five finalist, or if the event is going to be delayed — we just have no clue on what’s coming next,” narrative director Anahita Dalmia said. “Our spectrum of uncertainty is in regards to what do we do now that we don’t have this opportunity and how do we make up for the opportunity costs?” 
Dalmia, who heard about SXSW — an annual festival that invites filmmakers, music festival representatives and different interactive media creators to promote their upcoming projects and events — canceling Friday by an email from event representatives, said team members were disappointed that they would miss out on the opportunities provided by the event. She said they were looking forward to networking and meeting individuals interested in hiring entertainment designers.
“All of us were really excited about going to the conference,” said Dalmia, a senior majoring in narrative studies. “Me and my three other teammates — we intend to start a company next — were hoping that this would be a way for us to get sponsorship traction for our next events and potentially even clients.”
The team was relying heavily on the project to make connections and interact with members of the entertainment industry and introduce their plan to create Alterea, a company that creates events and games on alternative realities designed to have the audience actively contribute to the story through decisions they take while interacting with the characters to affect the outcome of the story.
“There’s definitely a lot of opportunities that we’re not going to get to have now,” McCarthy said. “There are a lot of connections that could have been made. There’s a lot of … development that is not going to happen anymore.”
The team that planned to attend SXSW, which included Dalmia, McCarthy, Barbato, design director Nick Griffith, a senior majoring in architectural design, and games director Madeleine Dile, a 2019 alumna, also suffered financial losses for flight tickets and accommodations. 
“What we’ve lost is minuscule compared to the amount of money a lot of other people have lost,” Dalmia said. “I think it was mostly $100 to $500 [each] because we were choosing to stay with friends and relatives … We are kind of trying to be mindful of the fact that the situation was completely out of our control.”
The show premiered in March 2019 at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom with more than 400 people in attendance. After their premiere, the group worked on creating a proposal for the 2020 SXSW conference that included shooting promotional videos to showcase their game design that was submitted in August. They were one of the 65 student submissions and chosen as one of the five finalists invited to Austin to showcase their project on March 14. 
In the meantime, Dalmia plans to work with Griffiths and Barbato for ASCEND to work with other organizations in Los Angeles by putting on an event similar to ASCEND but themed to Clifton Republic’s Hollywood history in July. She believes the group will have the opportunity to learn from this collaboration with the company. 
“That’s our personal next step because we strongly believe in the format that we’ve created and the potential of it,” Dalmia said. “It’s very experimental and everything can crash and burn and blow up in our face, but that’s a risk we are currently willing and able to take.”
