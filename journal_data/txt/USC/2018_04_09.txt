ECore, one of USC’s student clubs focused on environmental advocacy, called for President C. L. Max Nikias to sign a commitment to sustainability on campus. 
Dozens of students rallied for two hours, chanting phrases like “Hey Nikias, buy a Prius” and “High tuition, no green ambitions, all we have is hella emissions.” The ralliers marched around campus and walked onto USC Village, where they spotted Nikias and followed him.
Nikias left USC Village and the ralliers were asked to leave by USC Department of Public Safety.
The club also set up a table at Tommy Trojan, where they asked passersby to sign a petition urging Nikias to sign the Second Nature Presidents’ Climate Commitment, which promotes sustainable living on campus. The club sent Nikias a letter asking him to sign it. 
Nearly 600 universities have signed the commitment and reported on their sustainability, including New York University, California State schools and the University of California system.
ECore director Tianna Shaw-Wakeman said Nikias signing would hold the University accountable. 
“[The commitment] has increments for different years so if he signs it, it’s not something that doesn’t have any teeth,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “This is something that’s long term and it’s also something that students can stay a part of.” 
However, Mark Ewalt, the executive director of administrative operations for USC, said some of the points in the letter sent to Nikias are already included in sustainability plans and said that the University has made an effort to increase sustainability with the Sustainability 2020 plan and Sustainability 2030 proposal. 
The Sustainability 2020 plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from the levels in 2014, as well as decrease potable water use by 10 percent in 2020. 
The last update for the plan came last April and showed funding approved for several projects. The Sustainability 2030 proposal was prepared by the Academic Senate Sustainability Committee Task Force and calls for a “zero-waste” campus and reducing water usage by 50 percent, among other goals. 
Undergraduate Student Government Sustainability Advocacy Director Philine Qian said the rally was a strategic shift for the club. After winning a few smaller victories, such as the removal of plastic straws from dining halls earlier this month, Qian said students can only do so much in terms of sustainability. 
“It’s more effective for us to rally together for a bigger long-term goal,” Qian said. “Students shouldn’t have the responsibility and the pressure and the stress of coming up with creative ways for the University to reduce their carbon, water and waste footprint.”

USC will grant five people honorary degrees during the commencement ceremony on May 11. 
The recipients are USC’s commencement speaker and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Siddhartha Mukherjee, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck, USC Trustee Major General Charles Bolden Jr., biochemist Jennifer Doudna and filmmaker Forest Whitaker. 
According to the news release, USC is honoring them “for their work as philanthropic, academic, scientific, arts, civic and military leaders.” 
Mukherjee is an oncologist and assistant professor at Columbia University. USC noted that he is being honored for his cancer research. His novel, The Emperor of All Maladies, won a Pulitzer Prize, and was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 best nonfiction books of the past century. 
A retired Marine Corps general, Bolden graduated with a master’s degree from USC Viterbi School of Engineering in 1977. During his career as an astronaut, Bolden commanded and piloted four NASA missions to space. He joined the USC Board of Trustees in 2003, before leaving to serve as the NASA administrator under the Obama administration in 2009. Bolden rejoined the Board this year. 
LAPD Chief Beck is being honored for managing the police department of the second-largest city in the United States for nearly a decade. Beck has worked with the LAPD for over 40 years, and in that time, led programs such as the Safer Cities Initiative, which aimed to give shelter to and prevent crimes against individuals experiencing homelessness.
Doudna, a biochemist and chemistry professor at UC Berkeley, is credited with helping establish the field of CRISPR research, which uses RNA protein to create a mechanism that can edit the DNA of any organism. Her book, A Crack in the Creation, addresses the ethical implications of human control over genetics. 
Whitaker, a director, actor and producer, is the recipient of multiple awards, including a Golden Globe and Academy Award, for his acting in The Last King of Scotland. Most recently, Whitaker starred in Black Panther as the character Zuri. Beyond his work in cinema, Whitaker founded the Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative in 2012 to implement peace-building programs in communities affected by conflict.  
Along with the honorary degrees, 15,500 degrees will be commended this year, including over 1,500 doctorate degrees. The University’s 135th commencement ceremony is expected to draw 60,000 attendees, according to USC News. The ceremony will be held in Alumni Park.

Community members gathered Friday for a candlelight vigil for a student who died on campus on Wednesday. 
The student, McKenna Martin, was studying writing for screen and television, and served as a residential assistant at New North Residential College. The vigil was organized by the Office for Residential Education.
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni began the vigil with a moment of silence for Martin. In his remarks, he called Martin a role model and campus leader.
“When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight,” Soni said, quoting poet Khalil Gibran.
Soni’s remarks were followed by a speech from Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry.
“She is in our spirit, in our community,” Carry said in his speech. “[Her] energy is always with us.” 
Carry said that the University has been in contact with the Residential Education community and students at the School of Cinematic Arts to ensure that grieving students have access to the care they need. 
He emphasized that help is available for those who need it. Students can contact the Engemann Student Health Center to reach counselors at 213-740-7711, and staff members can contact the Center for Work and Family Life at 213-821-0800. 
Carry also mentioned the Trojans Care for Trojans program, which allows students and staff members concerned about their colleagues to anonymously submit online forms to bring those experiencing personal difficulties to the attention of USC Support & Advocacy. 
“Anytime we lose a student, as a member of the Trojan Family, it’s a devastating blow to the student body,” Carry said. “If you need help, ask.” 
Some attendees wrote messages to Martin’s family in journals that were passed around during and after the vigil. 
Neelesh Bagrodia, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering who attended the vigil, said he lived in Birnkrant Residential College on the same floor as Martin when they were both freshmen. 
“She was sweet and caring, and she would always be there for you with hot tea,” Bagrodia said. “Our favorite day was when we went to the beach during the first week of school. We were just getting to know each other, but it was then that I found that I had a home away from home here.” 
Joshua Shaw, a sophomore studying international relations and narratives studies who attended the vigil, said he was also Martin’s friend. 
“Every time I saw her in the dining hall this year, I would have 10 to 30-minute conversations with her and she always left me with new ideas,” Shaw said. “She always had something to give, whether it be humor, ideas, music … she exuded positivity.” 
Associate Dean of Religious Life Vanessa Gomez-Brake said in addition to Counseling Services, the University has more than 50 religious and spiritual leaders representing most faiths and worldviews who could serve as someone for those in need someone to speak with.
Soni said that grieving students have access to resources not only from the University, but also from the student community. 
“The best support students have in times of tragedy is each other,” Soni said.
A celebration of Martin’s life will be held Monday at 7 p.m. in Norris Theatre, Soni said.

USC hosted its sixth annual “TEDxUSC” Saturday. The event, sponsored by Undergraduate Student Government and the Academic Culture Assembly, took place on Saturday at Cammilleri Hall. 
Jose Richard Aviles performed at TEDxUSC | Mahira Raihan | Daily Trojan
The lineup featured six student speakers, who shared personal experiences through storytelling. For the first time, the event was streamed on Facebook Live.
The event’s theme, “Inspire,” was woven into each of the student’s speeches. Shane Shahrestani, a second-year Ph. D. student in the USC-Caltech M. D. /Ph. D. program, kicked off the event with his talk “An Interdisciplinary Approach to Health Disparities.” 
During the talk, he said that he created the app “Thumps,” after realizing the lack of medical accessibility in the world. The app allows users to see a visual representation of their heartbeat and learn their exact beats per minute by using their iPhone as a heart biosensor. 
USC graduate student Imani Johnson followed with a talk titled “A $10,000 Lesson.” She discussed the importance of teaching financial literacy in communities of color. Then, Keon Sanaie, a freshman majoring in business administration and political science, spoke about his personal experience of living with Tourette’s Syndrome in his talk, “Creation through Criticism.”
“I think there are a few issues that haven’t been fully explored,” Sanaie said. “TED provides this incredible platform by which these issues can be conveyed to a larger audience.”
After an intermission, Nicole Ricken, a sophomore majoring in psychology, performed an original song dedicated to children with cancer. 
Ailish Ullmann, a senior majoring in environmental science and health, gave a talk called “What’s missing from great science? Great storytelling,” sharing an anecdote of trying to convince her father of the existence of climate change. 
“It’s not enough for us to collect data and crunch numbers anymore,” Ullmann said. “As scientists, especially those with any stake in the health of the planet, we must be great storytellers.”
USC graduate student Adrian Herrera gave a talk called “The Role of a Wingman” on his experience as a gay man in a military fighter jet squad. USC graduate student Jose Richard Aviles spoke about how he came to a realization about his sexual orientation through dance in “La historia de mi cuerpo. Dance as Body History.”
The planning committee for this year’s event started coordinating the program last October. After receiving a high volume of applications, the committee narrowed the speakers down to six speakers. 
“Inspiring people doesn’t stop at personal stories,” said Winny Huang, the executive director of TEDxUSC. “If anything, that’s where it begins.”

The typically humdrum McCarthy Quad was transformed on Saturday into a musical hub, replete with vendor booths, food trucks and an outdoor concert stage for the annual Springfest organized by USC Concerts Committee. With a USC Concerts Committee estimate of 5,700 people in attendance, indie rock band Glass Animals headlined the event.

DJ Skyler Ren kicked off the evening with remixes of popular songs such as Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE.” and “m.A.A.D City.” Alongside Ren, rapper Sheck Wes performed songs like DJ Khaled’s “Wild Thoughts.” 
After Wes, electronic artist Medasin took the stage. His set included remixes of “The Office” theme song, Skrillex’s “Purple Lamborghini” and Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow,” all of which energized the eager crowd. 
Before rapper Playboi Carti hit the stage, the crowd booed as movie trailers played on the big screen. Attendees started chanting Playboi Carti’s name and yelling at the stage crew,. 
“I didn’t really understand why we had to watch movie trailers before Playboi Carti came out,” said Emily Fuesler, a freshman majoring in art. “Playboi Carti was really cool [and] he got people really crazy and excited.”
Once on stage, Carti performed hits like “Let It Go” and “Magnolia” from his self-titled 2017 album. Throughout his set, he encouraged a “mosh pit.” Students were happy to oblige and formed a large ring in front of the stage. At 9:43 p.m., Carti’s set was unexpectedly shut down, and he was escorted off the stage.
According to campus security, a fight broke out among students toward the end of his performance. Guards had to escort the fighting students out of the venue and cut Carti’s set short.
However, Concerts Committee said that there were no reports of any fights during the event and that Carti’s set was not cut short.
Subsequently, Oxford-based Glass Animals took the stage to rampant cheers from the audience. The band played popular hits “Gooey,” “The Other Side of Paradise” and “Life Itself.” During the set, lead singer Dave Bayley dove off the stage in true rockstar fashion and surfed through the crowd. 
The band also launched balloons into the crowd for audience members to lob around while it covered Kanye West’s “Love Lockdown” and Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy.” With ebullience and lively stage presence, Glass Animals proved to be a refreshing alternative to Springfest’s usual lineup of solo and hip-hop performers to students.
“I was hyped for Glass Animals,” said Jack Wilson, a sophomore majoring in communication. “I think it was an unexpected yet surprisingly delightful pick.”
Springfest also featured vendor booths, including a Tinder Lounge, virtual golf range, UberEats stall and promotions for the upcoming movies Avengers: Infinity War and Rampage. Food trucks were also parked along Pardee Lawn.
After last year’s Springfest shut down early since crowds exceeded maximum capacity, USC implemented new restrictions to ensure safety for this year’s event. Regulations included a requirement for students to pre-register for the event online, but access to the concert was granted on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
USC added DPS officers and LAPD to secure the event this year. They also closed off the campus at 8 p.m., instead of at 9 p.m., to control the oncampus traffic.
Students began to line up at McCarthy Quad for the event at 5 p.m., but entry was delayed due to issues with ID card scanners and technical difficulties with the stage audio.
 
EDITOR’S NOTE: This story has been updated to include comment and an updated attendance count from USC Concerts Committee.

President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he supported sending the military to guard the U.S.-Mexico border. In an era where global crises are expelling immigrants from their homelands and forcing them to seek refuge elsewhere, this proposed militarization of the American border is an unjust, inhumane act.
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
Yet, such threats are flanked on both sides of the American border: Not only must immigrants grapple with the possibility that the United States may turn them away and deny them safety and livelihood, but even if these individuals are fortunate enough to receive asylum, they must also live with the outsider-status that has been widely assigned to them in this country. This holds especially true for those who are noncitizens. A fallacy that is frequently used to explain why certain individuals remain undocumented or unnaturalized assumes that these individuals are lazy or unproductive. But this could not be further from the truth.
Since Fall 2017, the USC Gould School of Law has run the University’s immigration clinic. Under the direction of Gould faculty members Niels Frenzen and Jean Reisz, students from the law school voluntarily staff the clinic, which offers free help to members of the community seeking citizenship. More specifically, these students are working to demystify and universalize the process of naturalization as a whole. This program promotes inclusivity by acknowledging the barriers immigrants face in becoming citizens.
The Migration Policy Institute reported that as of 2016, roughly 11.2 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States. To generalize such a sizable population as lazy or unproductive is a gross mischaracterization, for it wholly neglects the ways in which these populations have contributed to American society. Efforts, then, must be made to grant citizenship to this ever-growing demographic.
It is necessary to recognize that inaccessibility to citizenship is an issue that is, by nature, intersectional. How can individuals afford to take time out of their days to gain citizenship if they are surviving day-by-day, paycheck-by paycheck? If they are being persecuted in public spaces for their noncitizen status? How can non-native English speakers in America even attempt to tackle the puzzling naturalization process in the first place?
Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that citizenship is largely inaccessible to those in low economic, educational and social standing. In the wake of this national dilemma, USC appears to have elected to take the right course of action. 
Thanks to the Gould clinic’s efforts, which have garnered support and funding from Provost Michael Quick, roughly 200 Angelenos have been able to take advantage of these pro bono services and earn the citizenship they have so long aspired to. For many of these former non-citizens, becoming a citizen is not only a source of pride, but also a first step toward other privileges, which include voting and traveling internationally. The fact that these clinic-goers, some of whom have lived in the United States for their entire lives, could not previously attain citizenship on their own signals an ongoing crisis of inaccessibility to citizenship in America. However, USC’s immigration clinic provides a promising glimpse at the looming democratization of citizenship, and it is time that this sort of aid expands to the national level. 
For Monique Magbuhos, a University employee who was born in the Philippines and has been a long-time resident of the United States, citizenship was a long-time goal — though a seemingly unattainable one. In her case, she wanted to become a citizen so she could visit Paris. The immigration clinic helped Magbuhos attain citizenship, a status she once believed would not be possible without great difficulty and expense. 
“I felt like a foreigner,” Magbuhos said in an interview with USC News. “Now I feel like I belong somewhere.” 
Now a U.S. citizen, Magbuhos plans to travel to Paris. What Magbuhos’ story reveals is that citizenship can secure one’s sense of belonging and pride in the United States, both feelings which are conducive to citizens’ productivity in and reverence toward this country.

On Friday and Saturday, USC hosted its 38th annual “Swim with Mike” event at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The event, which is a fundraiser for the organization of the same name, contributes to a scholarship fund that supports athletes with physical disabilities through higher education. Since its inception in 1981, “Swim with Mike” has raised over $20 million in funds.
Put simply, the event is an engaging, fun way to support a deeply important cause. People with disabilities remain too often overlooked and excluded in a society that regards traditionally healthy people as the default. But given that 15 percent of people worldwide have serious physical or mental disabilities, I have to wonder: Why does this group still need to gain visibility? Do we truly see people with disabilities and their needs? Or do we just stare?
When I was in high school, the special needs community had a notable presence on campus. This was in part due to the fact that our local chapter of Best Buddies, a national organization dedicated to empowering people with disabilities, was the largest club on campus. We held monthly mixers, put on a yearly production with the theater department and even reserved a few half-times at varsity basketball games for “HoopStars,” a local sports league for people with disabilities.
And yet, although my school made inclusivity a high priority through these programs, sometimes I can’t help but question how much of that support was just for show. Like many people, I joined Best Buddies because of a genuine desire to support a community in need, and like many people, I joined with no real idea of how to support this community. Once students had made their Instagram and Snapchat posts and adequately documented themselves as “good people,” participation in the club naturally began to dwindle by the end of the school year. I was one of the few people who stuck around.
And much of the reason for that was my peer buddy, a girl with mental disabilities for whom I served as a social mentor. I was excited yet cautious when I met her, as I assumed that the entirety of my role would be that of “caretaker,” and that us “hanging out” actually meant “babysitting.” But what I didn’t realize until later — and what I wish I had known sooner — was that my buddy was, above all, a friend. She was simply a person I liked spending time with. Looking back, I can confidently say that I got as much out of the relationship as I gave.
That said, I am no saint. Joining Best Buddies placed no burden on me, and I was no savior for simply being friends with my peer buddy. In fact, I’ve grown jaded by the cheesy narrative of people who merely associate themselves with members of the special needs community to portray themselves as heroes. People with disabilities do not exist to be fixed, nor do they exist for the sake of making “normal” people feel better about themselves. They exist because they exist, and as human beings it is our responsibility to treat them as humans as well. 
The biggest grievance our society has subjected those with special needs to is our habit of trying to understand them. We place them in crutches; we place them in wheelchairs; we place them inside a box limited by stereotypes and prejudice, and then place the box in some basement closet — out of sight, out of mind. We look at people with disabilities and see a problem that needs to be solved.
The other night, my friends convinced me to watch an episode of South Park entitled “Crippled Summer.” The episode follows Jimmy and Timmy, the show’s resident characters with disabilities, through a series of competitions as they attempt to become the camp’s champions. Indeed, it goes without saying that the episode’s representation of people with disabilities is insulting and distasteful. But the show’s comically ridiculous stereotypes force viewers — myself included — to confront their own prejudice; South Park takes people with disabilities out of the aforementioned “box” and shows us the very ugliness associated with disability that we’ve unfairly fabricated in our minds. 
Not all TV writers are as ambitious as South Park’s, but there is something to be said about the fact that people with disabilities are dramatically underrepresented in the entertainment industry at large. According to a 2015 report by USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative, only 2.4 percent of characters with speaking roles in the top 100 movies had disabilities. This exclusion from the screen not only fails to normalize the presence of the special needs community, but also reinforces the label of “otherness” we unconsciously place on them. 
Of course, greater exposure can’t equate to offensive exposure; we shouldn’t encourage people to throw around the word “retarded” and perpetuate harmful stereotypes surrounding people with disabilities, as we see in South Park. As we do for all human beings, we must exercise a sense of mindfulness and respect for the special needs community. The first step is to use “people first” language: For example, instead of saying “the disabled,” say “people with disabilities.” Sure, it’s a small gesture — but it makes a difference. 
In response to my previous confusion about how to support the special needs community, I’ve come to realize there isn’t one correct answer. Support means starting more fundraisers on campus like “Swim with Mike.” It means getting involved in USC’s chapter of Best Buddies. It means being a friend. And ultimately, most of the time, it means treating people like people.

“YOU are your own microcelebrity.” “YOUR digital content is your mundane labor. It is not your leisure. Someone is turning a profit.” These epiphanies came from the mind and work of Jeremy Reynoso, a senior studying at the USC Roski School of Art and Design. 
Photo courtesy of Jeremt Reynoso.
Reynoso’s first solo exhibition was on display at Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery in the Roski School of Art and Design until last Thursday. The show was confrontational, electric and controversial. Nothing was shy, including the aforementioned artist statement, stacks of which lay within one of the installations. At the top of the tree of life there isn’t love: there is lulz carries a message intended for mass absorption, but it was particularly impactful within the piece. 
Video compilations, sculpture, audio tracks and digital projections came together to deliver a clear message both psychologically and playfully. As viewers entered the show, they were greeted with what Reynoso described as “a culmination of everything I’ve been thinking about for the past year or so.” 
As for the title of the show: “The origin of the quote is dark … it is reminiscent of how we are living our lives through our phones, in a mediated space,” Reynoso said, adding, “We are living in an economy of attention as opposed to a real, social world.”
In front of the entryway was “A Return to Gameday.” The piece was decorated with USC folding chairs and coolers, and it sat behind “Hypebeast Overlord” statues, two ghostfaced characters adorned in garments patched with what seems to be every Greek letter the artist was able to acquire. Mounted on the cardinal coolers was a screen with a video of USC gameday-related footage and two ghost-faced figures dancing in an anything-but-subtle manner. Though the style of the video and the characters’ actions within it were seemingly playful, there was a darker message at play that was inevitably controversial. 
Reynoso described the piece as, “an exploration of gameday but also the larger culture it represents.” The piece was an “explicit cry for attention,” meant to address the traditionally exclusive “singular narrative” being sold to everyone. He noted that it was not an attack on anyone specific. Rather, it was a critique of wider establishments that exclude non-binary narratives.
A video projection and sculpture combination entitled “Ethical Consumer” alluded to the waves that seem to superficially mark and define Reynoso’s generation. A re-recorded, auto-tuned and offbeat rendition of “Closer” by The Chainsmokers played in the background as Reynoso appeared dancing and laying somberly in a field of grass. 
To the very right of the exhibit was “Manifesto for a Social Digital Task Force,” the face of the gadget’s screen projected on a hanging sheet. On the dark screen read “My Media Library,” an invitation into someone’s video folder. Reynoso said he felt most connected to this piece because of its unwavering relevance.
He described himself as “helplessly addicted” to social media. As for the future of social media, he believes that “people are starting to realize it is making them unhappy.” 
Reynoso said he wants to create art that is conscious of non-binary narratives, the larger implications of day-to-day habits and the refusal to accept the status quo. On-screen and within his work, Reynoso appeared as a fictional character, or, in his own terms, “a virtual molecule.” But unlike the masses who indulge in tech and social media, Reynoso is aware of its power and its widespread, deeply affecting nature. His critiques were not attacks; rather, they addressed the heteronormativity, racism and sexism that he believes have been rooted in and perpetuated by many institutions. 
Reynoso is not interested in making art that will please everyone, making him more susceptible to criticism. Reynoso is clearly not taking small steps; he is already addressing existential concepts without fear or hesitation, inviting controversy and advocating for social awareness and equality in an artistic approach intrinsically linked to and thus accessible for the modern generation.

Kenan Draughorne | Daily Trojan
Continue to overlook rapper Saba at your own peril. Yet another in a laundry list of bright young voices from Chicago, his sophomore album CARE FOR ME is a strong contender for hip-hop album of the year only four months into 2018. He’s already proven his ability as a lyricist on his debut album Bucket List Project and his impressive mixtape ComfortZone, and now, he’s once again in his pocket, with a renewed vigor and purpose that permeates his music.
Fifty-seven seconds into the intro song “BUSY/SIRENS,” we hear our first reference to John Walt, Saba’s fellow Pivot Gang member who was murdered in early 2017. Throughout the album, Saba is an open book about the impact that losing such a close friend had on his life, influencing the overall themes of self-care and loneliness behind CARE FOR ME. On the brilliant yet haunting two-part “PROM / KING,” this emotion comes to a head, as Saba poetically timelines his relationship with Walt and the fateful moments that led to his sudden death.
“We never really got along or used to kick it/In fact, if I remember vividly, he picked on me/He used to beat me up and take my sneakers every family visit,” Saba reveals on the first half of the song, causing him to hesitate when Walt offers to set him up with a date to senior prom. As the song unfolds, however, the two form a stronger bond until a sudden beat switch just before the fourth minute, when the blistering drum loop intensifies the pace and increases the urgency of the song. The passion in Saba’s cracking voice grows to a boiling point as he approaches the moment when he heard the news of Walt’s fatal stabbing, cutting off at the end to let Walt’s voice end the story with the touching refrain: “I just hope I make it ’til tomorrow.”
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
CARE FOR ME’s thesis is evident on the chorus of the pensive “CALLIGRAPHY” — “I just got tired of running away, running away/Everybody leaving, I write them away, write them away” Saba rhymes, over sparse piano chords that create a well-suited ambiance for the song. On this song as well as several others, fresh instrumentation and trap-influenced basslines combine for a formidable duo, housing Saba’s introspective verses with some of the best production he’s seen to date.
The Chance the Rapper-assisted “LOGOUT” follows the same formula and finds the same success, as Saba delves into the excessive use of social media and its negative side-effects. Chance closes the song with a 12-bar ventilation that ties the track together nicely, adding to a long line of solid collaborations between the two Chicago stars.
You’d be hard-pressed to find a fan of Saba who thought the success of his debut album Bucket List Project was a flash in the pan, but now the follow-up project verifies that the artist still has more to tell, with increased maturity that makes his messages resonate even deeper. In a year that has been somewhat underwhelming thus far in terms of hip-hop releases, CARE FOR ME is an early gem that deserves to be in the best albums conversation at the end of 2018, and has the potential to make Saba into a true household name going forward. 
Why I’m Smiling: All the new music from last Friday
The morning after Saba gave us CARE FOR ME, the rest of the music world responded in spectacular fashion, with a treasure trove of new albums from fellow rising stars. Kali Uchis’ Isolation, Tom Misch’ Geography and Cardi B’s Invasion of Privacy all lived up to lofty expectations, while Alina Baraz snuck the surprise album The Color of You and stole a spot near the top of the weekend’s charts. Drake gifted the culture with a preemptive summer anthem in “Nice For What,” which almost made Friday too much to bear; there was simply new material for every music fan, and more than enough to choose from.
Why I’m Shaking My Head: Killer Mike gets dragged by Joy-Ann Reid on Instagram
Only a few weeks after turning heads with his interview with the National Rifle Association about black gun ownership (and subsequently apologizing for how the NRA used the interview out of context with March for Our Lives), Killer Mike deemed it a good time to jab at Joy-Ann Reid after he assumed she was working with H&M, a company also tainted with allegations of racial insensitivity. As she was instead simply abbreviating “hair & makeup”  she made quick work of embarrassing the Atlanta rapper, who found himself backpedaling and apologizing once again. We ride with Killer Mike here at “To Pen a Butterfly,” but after two easily avoidable incidents like these, it might be best for him to simply lay low for the time being.
Why I’m Hopeful: Q-Tip to teach NYU music course on intersection between jazz and hip-hop
Is there any better artist to teach this course than such an integral member of A Tribe Called Quest, the pivotal group that beautifully merged the two genres throughout their discography? Kudos to the many colleges and high schools who have embraced hip-hop in their curriculums in recent years, and especially to New York University for approaching the topic from a different angle and nominating the perfect man for the job.

The USC baseball team came into this weekend’s series at Arizona State needing a spark from its bats and though it started the series with a loss, the team finished on Sunday with an 8-4 win.

During Game One on Friday, USC was off to a rough start.  Arizona State opened the scoring in the second inning when sophomore outfielder Hunter Bishop laid down a sacrifice bunt to score sophomore infielder Carter Aldrete.
ASU junior outfielder Gage Canning, who had the best batting average in the Pac-12 coming into the series, drove in the next two runs with a third inning solo home run and an RBI groundout in the fifth inning. In the eighth inning, a single from senior infielder Taylor Lane extended the Devil’s lead to 5.
The Trojans managed to bring in one run when freshman infielder Jamal O’Guinn walked with the bases loaded in the ninth. A possible Trojan comeback was snuffed out by back to back fly-outs, ending the first game at 5-1. Meanwhile, Arizona State’s sophomore starter Alec Marsh dominated the game, shutting out the Trojans in 8.1 innings.
Whatever went wrong for USC on Friday went right Saturday, as the Trojans dominated the Sun Devils 10-1. Freshman infielder Ben Ramirez and sophomore catcher Blake Sabol scored when junior second baseman Chase Bushor doubled down the right field line, bringing the margin to 3-0 for the Trojans.
Sabol’s double in the fourth drove in a run and started the scoring in another big inning, as the Trojans scored 2 more runs on a groundout by junior infielder Brandon Perez and a double from junior left fielder Lars Nootbaar.
The finishing blow came in the fifth with a Ramirez 3-run home run over the right field wall, extending the Trojans’ lead to 9-0. The homer gave the team its third 3-run inning and Ramirez his fourth RBI that day. Perhaps the most impressive part of the Trojans’ performance at the plate was that it came against ASU’s senior ace Eli Lingos.
After an RBI single by sophomore center fielder Matthew Acosta in the sixth, the Sun Devils mustered one run in the eighth but the game was already decided. USC junior pitcher Solomon Bates threw 7.2 shutout innings in his second start of the year to earn his second win, and he was relieved solidly by freshman pitcher Isaac Esqueda.
When asked what was working for him in a video posted on the team’s Twitter, Bates said, laughing, “I want to say everything, but [my] change-up was iffy, but I was just trying to hit my spots and get my boys a win today.”
On Sunday, the Trojans jumped on Arizona State early and rode the momentum to an 8-4 win. Perez tripled in the top of the first and eventually scored on a Nootbaar single. Perez scored again on junior first baseman Dillon Paulson’s third inning ground rule double to make it 2-0.
After Sun Devil Aldrete’s solo home run in the bottom of the fourth, the Trojans responded in the next frame with an RBI sacrifice fly by Nootbaar. Sabol’s squeeze bunt in the sixth scored Acosta from third and Ramirez followed up with an RBI single to give USC a 5-1 advantage.
A solo home run in the seventh inning cut the Trojans’ lead to 3, but Ramirez continued his hot streak with an RBI single the next inning to put USC back on top by four. Bushor chopped a high-hopping grounder over the third baseman’s head to score Ramirez and Sabol later in the eighth, making the score 8-2.
USC sophomore closer Connor Lunn held Arizona State scoreless in the ninth inning as the Trojans secured the series victory and improved the Trojans’ record to 16-12 on the season and 5-7 in the Pac-12.
Head coach Dan Hubbs complimented junior starter Quentin Longrie after the game, who allowed only three hits and one run in five innings Sunday. But the biggest factor was the success of the lineup, which had 14 hits for the second-straight game.
“The guys came through in the clutch in big spots and got hits,” Hubbs said on USC Baseball’s Twitter. “We were able to execute; we got bunts down when we needed to, moved guys up, balls in dirt and stolen bases, and we were able to play the way we need to play to score runs.”
The Trojans will need more hitting performances like these last two games if they want to continue to succeed. Next weekend the Trojans will welcome the Arizona Wildcats to Dedeaux Field for a three-game series.

The USC men’s volleyball team ended its season Saturday night with a loss to No. 13 Concordia University.

Although the Trojans began the year ranked in the top-15 with high expectations, and a three-game win streak to start, they proceeded to lose seven games in a row, and their season has been quite the rollercoaster ever since. 
The Trojans had a talented,  young team, and the players’ inexperience was often evident in late sets, including their 2-3 loss to then-No. 12 Grand Canyon University back in February, where they had the chance to pull off the upset but fell in the fifth set 15-12. If the Men of Troy were able to close out late sets, USC’s overall record of 7-19 could have just as easily been closer to 14-12. 
Head coach Jeff Nygaard has consistently preached the importance of focusing on internal development, building good habits, trusting the process and knowing that results and wins will follow. The Trojans had a taste of this optimistic mentality on Senior Night, when they upset crosstown rival UCLA in an exciting 3-2 victory that earned USC its first and only win over a ranked opponent on the year. 
Along with that win, the team ended second in the non-conference Texaco Rainbow Warrior Classic. They were also consistently ranked for the first half of the season and swept Stanford. They also earned a top-six seed in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoffs. 
With only four departing seniors and a number of freshmen playing key roles this season, USC has a bright future ahead, and should continue to use this season as a period of growth that will prime them for success in the coming years.
Overall, redshirt junior outside hitter Jack Wyett was a stand out player, ending the season with a total of 373 kills and an overall hitting percentage of .280. The other half of the outside hitting duo consisted of junior Gianluca Grasso, who finished with 247 kills on a .225 percentage. 
Freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis became a contributor toward the end of the season, recording 142 total kills and 78 blocks throughout the season. Redshirt senior setter Gert Lisha had a consistent performance throughout the season while leading the team’s offense with 622 assists. The team often ran a 6-2 offense with freshman setter Chris Hall contributing 432 assists.
Wyett led the defensive game with 140 digs. Freshman libero Cole Paxson followed closely with 130 digs, while junior outside hitter Ryan Moss and Grasso contributed 130 and 114 digs, respectively. 
Compared to their opponents throughout the season, the Men of Troy had a low average hitting percentage of .263. They committed 67 blocking errors compared to their opponents’ 47, leaving them with fewer blocks per set. They were also outkilled, 1234-1310.
The USC men’s volleyball team will say goodbye to Wyett, Lisha, opposite hitter Jon Rivera and middle blocker Connor Inlow, all of whom will graduate this May. The team still shows young promise from Lewis, Paxson and Hall, who will carry on from the tough lessons learned this season into offseason training to prepare for next spring. 
All in all, it may not have been the season USC expected, but it could prove to be the season they needed in laying the foundation for the coming years to return to their winning ways.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
On Wednesday, Major League Baseball made history. It wasn’t for the longest home run, the most strikeouts or any other statistic. The day marked the first time an MLB game (Phillies at Mets) was exclusively broadcasted live on Facebook.
As expected, the broadcast drew mixed reactions. Some fans were thrilled that they could easily watch the Phillies-Mets game on their computer and not have to worry about finding a TV, deal with pesky blackouts or pay the insane price to access MLB.tv. But other fans became frustrated with the new medium. For many viewers, this was their first time watching a broadcast on Facebook Live and they had trouble understanding how to navigate the service, including special features such as the comments overlay and flow of emotes and likes. Broadcaster Scott Braun explained that these features can easily be turned off, to which his partner, Cliff Floyd, responded, “Why would you do that?”
I couldn’t agree more with Floyd. The reason fans don’t like these features is that they are unfamiliar. It will take time to become comfortable with these newly introduced services, but viewers should embrace the increased agency to comment and react to the broadcast, as this enriches the experience.
As a journalism student who hopes to work as a live baseball broadcaster, I am often asked questions like, “Isn’t journalism dying?” or “Won’t TV become obsolete?” My answers are no and yes, respectively — both journalism and television are evolving. With that evolution, viewers, broadcasters and journalists have to understand the potential of these new platforms and how to effectively use them.
The fact of the matter is that this form of broadcast is not new. Traditional professional sports — including the NBA, MLB, NFL and NHL — are late in adopting streaming services and a significant portion of their fans have never been exposed to this form of broadcast, as it is mostly common with esports. I only notice this because of my familiarity with esports.
Esports are progressive in their broadcast methods. The first esports matches I watched on Twitch caught me by surprise. The broadcast quality and the sense of community they created were an unrivaled experience. Fans are able to simultaneously watch the match and chat with other viewers all on the same platform. Before, I had to open a new tab or pull out my phone and navigate to a social media site to post trash talk, my comments or questions. Even then, the chance that I would reach other fans watching the game was slim. With the Twitch chat, I could instantaneously reach everyone watching the match.
A couple years later, the first Counter Strike: Global Offensive match was shown live on TBS. I recall my excitement that esports was making a huge leap forward into the mainstream. I was thrilled to be able to watch the match on TV. When the show came on, the experience was lost. I missed the on-screen chat and ability to message those watching. I felt like I had been pushed further from the community and action of the match. Since that day, I have opted to watch events via a streaming service.
Perhaps the best feature of streaming services are their portability. I can watch a stream on my computer and instantly transfer it to my phone without skipping a beat or missing a thing. While traditional forms of TV offer phone access for live TV, those services are so frustrating that it’s often not worth it. All I need to do when using Facebook Live or Twitch is log onto a website.
While there is no doubt that platforms like Twitch and Facebook Live enhance the viewing experience for fans, they also make  things easier for broadcasters. Streaming services allow broadcasters to connect with their audiences. Viewing the stream’s live chat allows the casters to connect with viewers and answer questions or respond to comments. This interaction brings fans closer to the game and encourages them to be active viewers. 
This experience is foreign to many viewers, especially to those only familiar with traditional TV. As with all technology, there is a learning curve. It will take a couple years for fans to become comfortable using streaming services. However, I have no doubt that once viewers begin to adopt streaming services as their primary form of media consumption, television will become obsolete. 
This is not necessarily a bad thing. Does anyone disparage the fact that streaming services like Netflix pushed DVD stores like Blockbuster out of business? No. It is a better service and provides a better user experience. The way we consume media is constantly evolving and we must adapt to and welcome these changes.
