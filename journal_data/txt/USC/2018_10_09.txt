Sophomore driver Jacob Mercep has scored 34 goals in 2018 over 15 games with 11 multi-goal games. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
After maintaining a perfect record through 17 games, the No. 1 men’s water polo team fell to No. 3 Stanford in a contentious 13-11 battle in Palo Alto Saturday. The Trojans then returned to Los Angeles Sunday, where they bested San Jose State in a 16-5 victory. 
In USC’s first match of the weekend, freshman driver Hannes Daube delivered a fourth period boost for the Trojans, netting 3 goals to bring them within 1 of Stanford. With 31 seconds remaining, Stanford delivered the dagger goal to end the contest. 
Saturday’s showdown opened with early offensive pressure from the Cardinal. USC freshman goalie Nic Porter came in clutch early in the game with two big saves. In the third minute of the match, Stanford drew first blood. The Trojans responded just seconds later with a 6-on-5 goal from junior two-meter Matt Maier. 
The game continued with back-and-forth scoring as the Cardinal pulled a goal ahead several times, but the Trojans evened the score multiple times. At the end of the first frame, the match was tight with Stanford leading 4-3.
The Cardinal gained momentum at the start of the second period, extending their lead by 2 goals. USC bounced back with a goal to make the score 6-4 in Stanford’s favor, but the Cardinal quickly brought their advantage back to 3 with a shot at the near post.
Once again, the Trojans mounted a comeback. Daube scored his second goal of the game and sophomore driver Jacob Mercep capped off a first-half hat trick to put USC just 1 behind of the Cardinal, 7-6. At halftime, Stanford held a 8-6 lead over the Trojans. 
The Cardinal extended their advantage in the third frame, opening with a 6-on-5 goal before amassing a game-high 5-goal lead with three minutes to go in the third. An important defensive block from Maier kept out a 6-on-4 effort from Stanford that could have further extended its lead, but the Trojans capitalized on the other end of the pool with a goal. A crucial block and save from USC prevented Stanford from further scoring, resulting in a score of 12-8 heading into the final frame.
After falling short at Stanford, the Trojans returned home on Sunday to take on San Jose State. The Spartans challenged USC in the first few minutes, responding to USC’s 3 early goals with 2 of their own on power plays. Despite the unexpectedly close score at the start of the match, the Men of Troy were able to pull away later in the game.
“We were just having a rough start at the beginning,” Daube said. “But we talked about it in the meeting, started off good in transition, getting some early goals, open[ing] up the lead. And we just kept a positive attitude and kept going from there.”
Junior driver Marin Dasic found freshman two-meter Jake Ehrhardt for a quick tip-in toward the end of the first period. From then on, the Trojans dominated.
USC outscored San Jose State 4-1 in the second period, expanding its lead to 7. Although the Spartans scored 3 second-half goals, they were no match for the Trojans’ offensive effort. Eleven different Trojans put points on the scoreboard, resulting in a final score of 16-5. 
Even after a commanding victory, the Men of Troy seek to improve their play for the upcoming games.
“We just need to focus more on defense,” Daube said. “We didn’t execute our game plan [on Saturday], but we have a week to prepare and have another go at it next week.” 
The Trojans will make their way back to Stanford for the Mountain Pacific Invitational Friday through Sunday, where they will take on four different opponents in tournament play. Their tournament will kick off against the Air Force on Friday, while their opponents for the following days have yet to be determined.

Life is all about luck. 
If you want to convince me otherwise, I would invite you over, sit you down, show you the 2006 American League Championship Series and have you explain to me how the Detroit Tigers’ run to the World Series wasn’t luck. 
Much like the players on the diamond — including Magglio Ordóñez — journalists sometimes get lucky. 
And just like luck works in favor of the Tigers, sometimes journalists get unlucky, too. 
This conversation might sound eerily similar to something you might hear along 28th Street from a group of students who claim, “They didn’t just get in because their parents went here.” But I implore you to stick around and listen to the other side of journalism politics. 
This past weekend, I was on Instagram (as usual) and I came across the profile of a woman who is the daughter of one of the Los Angeles Rams’ assistant coaches. For background, she works at NFL Network and Fox Sports as a production assistant, and also happens to interview Rams players from time to time. 
She was posting about how there are people out there who make her feel bad for getting access to the Rams simply because her father is one of the coaches. 
She claimed that while everyone else was vacationing during summers and spring break, she was working hard and covering Rams training camp, sacrificing her vacation time. 
This presents an interesting discussion about nepotism inside the world of sports media and whether or not journalists deserve the jobs we have. 
This brings to mind broadcasters Kenny Albert, Joe Buck and countless others whose parents were former on-air reporters and media members.
Just like Albert, the coach’s daughter was lucky. For whatever reason, she was in a position that most aspiring sports journalists would love to be in. 
While nobody deserves to be lambasted  for circumstances out of their control, complaining about getting heat for it on social media is extremely disrespectful to those who have had to struggle more for success. 
She undoubtedly works hard, but a lot of other journalists work just as hard, if not harder, and will never even see the inside of the Coliseum because they aren’t the daughter of an NFL coach. 
Now, I can confidently say that I did not deserve some of the jobs I’ve received, and there are others who agree.
Even though I am columnist here at the Daily Trojan, there’s is no doubt that there are more talented and qualified writers out there. 
Regardless, I’m thankful and lucky that I have this position. 
We should all act humbly. None of us deserve anything more than what we’ve worked for and past that, we should be thankful for the opportunities that luck brings our way. 
Getting a leg up from your friends or family might be a little controversial but in this industry, it is all about who you know and I don’t blame her for taking advantage of her dad being a coach — she would be a fool not to.
The first major gig I landed in the summer before my freshman year of college was because of someone I knew. I worked for free every weekend that summer at the Del Mar race track as a production assistant. But I only has that opportunity because a guy named Eddie B., who I met calling my high school’s baseball team, knew someone at the network that broadcasts all the horse races.
If I hadn’t met Eddie, would I have the job at TVG Network based on my skills alone? Most certainly not, and that’s unfair. 
It’s unfair to people who have to work minimum wage jobs to support their families and can’t take unpaid internships in the summers and during the school year. 
And while I shouldn’t necessarily feel guilty about getting that gig, I should still be thankful and appreciative of the opportunities I’ve been given and the connections I’ve made because not everybody is as lucky.
We journalists have to stick together. It’s a rough situation with this current job climate.
Although some may want to protect their own interests — and for good reason — we must ensure that the most prominent reporters are recognized for their talents. 
Nepotism should not be the way talented individuals achieve success. 
In the wise words of Amy Hempel, “There’s no such thing as luck. Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.”

On Sunday, the School of Cinematic Arts held a screening of Claudia Katayanagi’s film “A Bitter Legacy,” which explores the devastating period of internment of Japanese Americans by the U.S. government during World War II and its effects on Japanese American society. 
The film began with an introduction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, which forcibly removed more than 100,000 Japanese Americans from their homes and placed them in 10 internment camps across the American west.
The film then describes the Manzanar riot, an incident at an internment camp that left two inmates dead at the hands of American soldiers. The riot was a watershed moment for the creation of the secretive and highly militarized Citizen Isolation Centers, which are now considered precursors to Guantanamo Bay. 
The film shows how the Manzanar riot provided the pretext to create these Isolation Centers, first at Moab and later at Leupp for persons deemed “troublemakers.” In it, the relocation center administrators subjectively classified “troublemakers,” from people who were politically involved to those who hated the administration.
 After the screening, writer Diane Emiko Tsuchida gave a presentation detailing her family’s internment and her grandfather’s experience at the Leupp Isolation Center. 
“He starts to protest the incarceration and doesn’t shy away from being vocal or opinionated … he racks up three infractions that label him as a troublemaker,” Tsuchida said. 
Tsuchida later recounted an instance from her grandfather’s internment where he said that FBI agents held him for six hours and forced him to sign a statement by verbally and physically abusing him.
“What my grandfather claimed here I actually know is true because my dad remembered my grandfather could only chew food on one side of his mouth for the rest of his life after camp. So I can only conclude that they did a lot worse than slap him,” Tsuchida said. 
Tsuchida’s grandfather was later taken away from their camp in handcuffs as her father, a young boy at the time, watched. During his stay at Leupp, Tsuchida’s grandfather did his best not to attract attention so he could return to his wife and son; eventually, he was reunited with his family at Tulelake.
After Tsuchida shared her family’s account, the floor opened up for the audience to ask questions. One attendee spoke out about his own experience in the internment camps and his subsequent enlistment in the Military Intelligence Service, which recruited Japanese speakers to decode documents and interrogate prisoners of war. 
His testimony led Katayanagi to invite anyone who had interned family members to share, a request that many in the audience obliged.
Katayanagi brought the emotionally charged event to a close by speaking out against the current targeting of minorities and lamented a return to racist attitudes that existed during the time of the Japanese American internment. She spoke of the necessity for everyone to speak out against these injustices. 
“We have a right to speak up and to fight and we all have that duty right now to really fight hard because that pendulum has swung and now we’ve got to push it back,” Katayanagi said.

Jocelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
Last Thursday, I sat in the gilded foyer of Marciano Art Foundation surrounded by press personnel from across the Los Angeles art scene who were infinitely more experienced and better dressed than I was. Armed with my artsiest tote, notepad and knowledge from hours of internet stalking Ai Weiwei, I (a dazed, but eager editorial intern) was ready to come face to face with the storied Chinese activist-artist at the opening reception for his first major solo exhibition in Los Angeles. My heart raced as Ai took the podium to address the meager congregation of journalists. Donning a modest navy linen button-down and his signature salt-and-pepper beard, and speaking gently and graciously in accented English, he hardly looked the part of a dissident christened the most dangerous man in China. 
As evidenced by the involuntary gasp I captured on my voice recording of his speech, I was starstruck. 
Growing up, vacations to China were so scarce that each trip became a sentimental ordeal. I would mark the dates on calendar with a bold marker and start brushing up on my Chinese for my grandparents months in advance. I would dream of my aunts steaming, savory dumplings, the playground near my cousins apartment and the neon street signs Id see as I rattled across Beijing in a rickety city bus. These excursions throughout my parents homeland became some of the most colorful and nostalgic memories of my childhood. 
Ai Weiwei is influential to me and so many others because he utterly shattered that illusion. 
Under Chinas porcelain veneer is an illustrious history of rebels and free-thinkers such as Ai, who has been beaten by police, kept under house arrest, subjected to surveillance and had his studio bulldozed for exercising free speech. Through digital media and art installations of epic proportions, Ai calls attention to global human rights violations. From smashing a Han Dynasty urn to flipping off Tiananmen Square Gate in an outrageous photograph, he is a decidedly unsaintly provocateur  even having a meal with Ai or retweeting him is regarded as an act of rebellion. 
No matter the medium or genre, Ai never fails to deliver a larger-than-life message of disdain. Walking into every one of his exhibitions (which teeter on the boundary between political commentary and spectacle), I am immediately stunned by both the the grand scale and intricate intensity of his work. 
At MAFs Ai Weiwei: Life Cycle, I was greeted by a vast, hallucinatory sea of 50 million handmade sunflower seeds spread in a plinth across the ground affront an equally majestic amalgamation of broken teapot spouts. Sunflower Seeds and Spouts serve as metaphors for the futility of materialism and the preservation of individuality amid mass production and collectivist thinking. 
Further in the gallery is the exhibitions centerpiece, Life Cycle  a large-scale raft reminiscent of those used by refugees heading for Europe  flanked by Ten Windows, vignettes depicting scenes from Chinese history, and overlooked by Shanhaijing, bamboo-and-silk mythical creatures suspended from the ceiling. 
I walked the perimeter of the entire gallery at least six times and noticed new thematic minutiae each time. I read every single inscription encircling the base of Life Cycle, gripping quotes about mass human migration from historical figures. I felt, solemnly and wholly, the pain of the plights Ai wanted to reproduce as well as the grievances that motivated him. 
Above all, no matter how big a stake he claims in the global human rights crisis, Ai remains true to his roots. Every idea, every motif, every material chosen harkens back to Chinese culture and history, and serves as condemning commentary on the governments blatant oppression of its citizens. Walking through his galleries, I was overcome with reverence for Chinas esteemed history, yet also frustrated at its current human rights track record. I am reminded of how lucky I am that my father had the opportunity to attend university so I wouldnt have had to grow up under its tyrannical regime. I wouldnt have been able to pen this column, broadcasting my neuroses across campus, receive such a prestigious higher education or even have a younger sibling. 
In his 2012 documentary Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, Ai likens art-making to a game of chess, saying artists are merely responding to the circumstances of the world around them. Given that he spent his childhood banished for his fathers dissenting poetry and all he has endured at the hands of state police, Ais extravagance and lack of remorse are no surprise. Ill always have a soft spot for my motherland, but it took one hell of a delinquent artist in exile for me to see China for what it truly is.

From noon Saturday until late Sunday, Adult Swim Festival took over Row DTLA for two full days of music, art and comedy. The festival was the first of its kind from Adult Swim, Cartoon Network’s nocturnal adult-programming block.
Between sets, patrons entertained themselves with attractions as quirky and surreal as Adult Swim’s content — a mechanical bull shaped like a hot dog, a “Rick and Morty”-themed mini-golf course and a giant dome representing Meatwad from “Aqua Teen Hunger Force.”
Early on Saturday, San Diego-based surf-punk band Wavves took the festival’s Calico Stage. The band performed several songs about relationships, binge drinking and hangovers, accompanied by a visual display of World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Vince McMahon that played on a loop throughout the set. Members of the meager audience sang along and moshed, true to the rebellious youth attitude the young band embodies.
Hip-hop and glitch producer Clams Casino was next on the Calico Stage, and one of the few DJ acts of the weekend. A larger crowd had finally arrived, and Clams Casino welcomed them with a lucid set that maintained his atmospheric and ethereal bounce. Songs like “Norf Norf” and “LVL” caused the crowd to come together and mosh. 
As a salute to rapper Mac Miller, a collaborator and friend who died last month, Clams Casino played his instrumental from “One Last Thing.” To close his set, Clams Casino performed a new song with hip-hop artist Plu2o Nash titled “Gravity.” 
When the sun went down, the Brainfeeder Takeover on the Tabby Stage began, featuring artists from the record label of the same name. Austrian electronic artist Dorian Concept displayed his talent to the audience with a visual backdrop of the four controllers he played and manipulated on stage. Despite his relatively complex production, the audience received his set well and got in the mood for acts to come. 
Next, fellow Brainfeeder labelmate Georgia Anne Muldrow and her band of five conquered with an explosive jazz-driven set that displayed their raw talent and energy. Dudley Perkins later accompanied the group. After Muldrow’s crew cleared the stage, comedian and “The Eric Andre Show” co-host Hannibal Buress emerged for a half-hour stand-up set. Initial technical difficulties detracted from the multimedia aspect of “The Hannibal Buress Experience”; however, Buress succeeded in producing some chuckles with hilarious observations on hip-hop culture and the use of Auto-Tune in everyday life.
Bassist Thundercat (aka Stephen Bruner) was next on the Brainfeeder Takeover. As well-known for his live performances as his recorded material, he delivered intricate, mind-blowing jams of songs like “Heartbreaks + Setbacks,” “Captain Stupido” and “Tron Song.”
“I love my cat more than most people, like a lot more … like a lot,” Thundercat joked while playing the opening notes to “A Fan’s Mail.” “I think Adult Swim has a lot of cat fans. Shoutout to all my cats.”
Thundercat concluded the set with a touching tribute to Mac Miller in an emotional yet funky rendition of “Them Changes” before passing the torch to Brainfeeder founder Flying Lotus.
Multi-genre producer and visual artist Flying Lotus provided a gripping finale to Saturday’s Brainfeeder Takeover with his acclaimed three-dimensional visual display, for which the festival provided glasses. Flying Lotus opted for a more atmospheric, slow opening before the crashing drums and spooky jingles from “Getting There” blasted from the speakers. Featuring influences from psychedelic culture, surreal imagery and body horror, the visuals provided a breathtaking accompaniment to his dizzyingly intricate instrumentals. 
Toward the end of his set, Flying Lotus broke out his rapping alter-ego Captain Murphy for a tongue-in-cheek performance of “Dead Man’s Tetris,” before concluding with the weekend’s most uplifting tribute to Mac Miller in the Kendrick Lamar-assisted “Never Catch Me.” Flying Lotus kept an image of the late rapper-producer on his visual display throughout the song and revealed that he was celebrating his birthday that night before retreating offstage for the final time.
On Sunday, what would’ve been one the most aggressive and energetic sets of the festival was unfortunately canceled, as $uicideBoy$, a hip-hop duo from New Orleans, dealt with their personal health. To compensate for their absence, Adult Swim recruited Run the Jewels’ DJ Trackstar to perform a set, which exclusively comprised West Coast artists such as Tyler, the Creator, Vince Staples, Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock.
When the Sunday sun went down, Oakland rapper Kamaiyah brought her clever, cheeky lyrics and sticky production to the Tabby Stage. Accompanied by DJ Vision and a team of dancers, Kamaiyah provided a loose, fun-loving performance. Songs like “N—as,” “Addicted to Ballin’” and “Fuck It Up” featured charismatic flows and at-times hilarious lyrics about relationships, parties and her breakout as an artist.
Next was one of the festival’s main attractions, the “Rick and Morty Musical Ricksperience,” featuring the Hollywood Chamber Orchestra playing the show’s score. Composer Ryan Elder also made an on-stage appearance, introducing the orchestra and starting the show with a live rendition of “The Rickshank Redemption.” 
Elder revisited the stage again to welcome sister act Chaos Chaos. The duo performed previously in the festival and played their song “Do You Feel It,” which is featured in the show. Accompanying them later was voice actor John Roberts, who voices Linda Belcher in the hit animated show, “Bob’s Burgers.” Roberts, as Linda, sung “Terry Fold” with Chaos Chaos, a number originally sung by the band and “Rick and Morty” creator Justin Roiland. Continuing the weekend’s festivities, rappers Open Mike Eagle and Father revisited the festival stage to perform a live rendition of “Get Schwifty.” 
As a whole, the festival served as a celebration of Adult Swim’s most prominent productions and affiliates. Performers and patrons alike were fans of the late-night programming block, which contributed to the intimacy of the weekend’s many acts and attractions. The festival is sure to be a staple of the Los Angeles festival scene for years to come, and expanded activities and tighter organization should ensure successful future interactions.

In Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ acclaimed play “Gloria,” tempers flare between co-workers in a stunning portrayal of office life. (Photo courtesy of Echo Theater Company)
Echo Theater Company’s production of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ “Gloria” defies all expectations — what begins as a biting workplace comedy becomes a frightening examination of morality and mortality executed with stunning precision. 
The play begins in the offices of an unnamed American magazine, and tensions between co-workers drive the plot from the get-go. Jacobs-Jenkins worked at The New Yorker in his 20s, and while he says the content of “Gloria” is not based on that experience, he ingeniously inserts knowledge of the day-to-day grind of content creation in the seemingly doomed print industry.
The first act features three editorial assistants and an intern working in their respective cubicles, each dissatisfied with their jobs. Miles (played by the hilarious Devere Rogers), is the first intern to arrive at work, much to the chagrin of his supervisors. Then comes Ani (Alana Dietze), followed by Dean (Michael Sturgis, a powerhouse actor and a USC graduate), who arrives late and hungover. 
Last is Kendra (Jenny Soo), who snappily asks Dean, “Why do you look like you’ve raped yourself?” 
Dean was one of the only people to attend their colleague Gloria’s party the night before; he was under the impression that Kendra and Ani would be there, but they were only joking. Gloria (brilliantly understudied by Nicole DuPort) is described as the “office freak,” and Dean is repeatedly chastised for attending her party. 
But the topic of Gloria is pushed aside after Lorin (a manic Steven Strobel) comes in to tell the three editors that he is working on a profile of Sarah Tweed, an Alanis Morissette-type singer who died that morning. 
“Why the fuck are we only interested in her now, now that she’s dead,” he complains. 
Although Sarah Tweed is fictional, her death in the play represents more than a stressful deadline. But the irony of the characters’ attempts to monetize her passing is not apparent until the second act, following a graphic turn of events. 
Throughout “Gloria,” Jacobs-Jenkins’ dialogue is realistically fervent and reveals his characters’ desires — most of which relate to finding another job — without appearing contrived. 
“You know what ‘code’ is,” Dean says to Ani. “All I can do is read English! You can go somewhere else.”  
Their hilarious dynamic worked well with Chris Fields’ tight direction. The employees waste no time as they bicker, but somehow maintain an illusion of completing work.
Amanda Knehan’s set design is pleasingly minimalistic and contributes perfectly to the show’s obsessive themes; Dean’s cubicle features a small but glaring sign that reads, “Work fucking harder.”
Dianne Grabner’s costume design is similarly accomplished. Dean wears slightly ill-fitting orange pants, while the second act includes two perfectly-styled gray and black winter ensembles that steal one’s focus, peaking with Dietze languidly removing her oversized coat and scarf in a midtown Starbucks. 
The play’s position as a Pulitzer Prize finalist and Jacobs-Jenkins’ standing as a MacArthur Fellow are not without serious warrant. “Gloria” speaks volumes and breathes new life into the Echo Theater Company production.

South Los Angeles has an image of being riddled with gang violence. But things were out of the ordinary when Cameron Terrell, a white high schooler from an affluent suburban neighborhood in the outskirts of Los Angeles, was charged for murder in a gang-related setting last October. Terrell was acquitted in July, while the two younger black participants in the murder of Justin Holmes were incarcerated on counts of murder. 
This is an example of the “white privilege” that has became a more recognized — and protested against — phenomenon.
One of the most prominent cases that also demonstrates this happened in 2016, when Brock Turner, a white, affluent student-athlete at Stanford University was convicted of three counts of sexual assault. He was let off alarmingly easily: six months in jail (and he was released after three months for good behavior). 
To many, the Turner case represented the advantage that the population of privileged white men in the justice system. There was an overwhelming amount of criticism toward the American criminal justice system and its inability to properly serve justice, yet as Terrell’s case shows, no progress has been made.
The only way to equalize the system in favor of justice is not to treat the rich, white men more harshly, but rather to treat marginalized people better. This can only be accomplished with a more diversified staff, especially judges, in the court.
It has become increasingly clear that race and affluence greatly contribute to an individual’s likelihood of incarceration. 
The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that though 64 percent of the American population is non-Hispanic white, but only 39 percent of those are non-Hispanic white. Meanwhile, 13 percent of the U.S. population is black, but make up 40 percent of the incarcerated population. For every 100,000 people, 450 non-white Hispanics are in prison, 831 Hispanic people are in prison and  — most staggeringly — 2,306 black people are in prison. 
This cannot be simply attributed to the idea of Hispanic and black people participating in more crimes, but rather inequality embedded into the justice system. With Turner — who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman at a fraternity party and could have faced a sentence of up to 14 years — the public was alarmed when he only received six months of jail time. 
The judge stated that he did not want a “severe impact” on the life of Turner when questioned about the leniency of the sentence, implying that the people of color who receive stiffer sentences have lives where there will not be a “severe impact” from jail time, at least in the eyes of the law. 
Surely, the judge did not intend to deliberately exhibit racism. However, it is still evident that he values the lives of rich white men over that of their poorer and non-white counterparts. This is not the judge’s fault per se, but rather the system’s, for favoring the hiring a certain cutout of judges: white males. People will show mercy to those they can connect with, and these white judges will, inevitably, show mercy to the defendants who look like them.
Beyond race, Terrell’s case was extremely affected by his affluence. Terrell’s family was easily able to pay the $5 million bail posted, which gave the jury the opportunity to see Terrell as more than a criminal; he had the ability to go home at night, walk around the park or eat at the cafeteria. 
As a result, the jury unconsciously created a softer image for Terrell; no longer was he the cold-blooded getaway driver. Instead, he became, in the eyes of the jury, a kid who made a mistake. According to statistics provided in the study “Racial and Gender Diversity on State Courts: An AJS Study,” a majority of states have a severe deficiency in minority and women judges. The median percentage of minority judges in each individual state is 7.4 percent, with the mean percentage of minority judges being 9.3 percent. Though the percentage of women judges is far higher, with the median being 20.35 percent and a mean of 21.2 percent, it is unarguable that courts have a severe lack of diversity. 
The data is extremely alarming to most, as should be the case. It is nearly impossible for the justice system to be impartial to race if the court itself largely consists of white males. 
The only solution to combating racism, and more specifically the white privilege that has become embedded into the justice system, is to attack the racism and white privilege that exists at the head of the justice system —  the judges. With the diversification of who presides in court, we can begin to make true progress toward treating minority defendants with the grace and leniency that clients like Terrell received due to white privilege.

Adriana Sanchez | Daily Trojan
On Sept. 30, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 826, a measure that will mandate a gender quota on the boards of directors of California-based companies. Essentially, the California government requires at least one woman on companies’ boards by the end of 2019, and those who do not comply will be fined. Companies with over five board positions are required to include at least two women by the end of 2021, and companies with six must include three women. 
The premise that women should be represented on company boards is undoubtedly full of merit, and a goal that we should strive for collectively and unequivocally. A study by The Catalyst found that companies with women on their boards outperformed those with no women by 53 percent, experienced higher return on sales and a greater return on investment capital. Women are just as capable as men to sit on the board of or lead executive companies — that is unquestionable. 
But the solution to achieve an ideal market where women are accurately represented is not through government coercion and intervention. Senate Bill 826 is textbook government overreach in the business sector. Pressure for board diversity must come from the public and company shareholders, not from the government. 
The free market is a cornerstone of the American economy, and competition among companies. Government interference in this market should be limited at all costs.  
The bill Brown signed essentially mandates affirmative action in the business sector; and in this case, it’s useful to acknowledge the legal view of affirmative action in college admissions as an example. In University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court ruled that though race can be considered in college admissions, racial quotas in building an incoming class were unconstitutional. In my opinion, gender quotas are no different. Colleges, unlike corporations, are judged and ranked by how diverse they are. Public pressure from rankings and applicants have effectively forced colleges to admit students with diverse backgrounds. This progressive change came not through a government mandate, but through pressure from universities’ stakeholders and applicants.
If California truly wants to be at the forefront of progressive change, the solution is not government mandates for gender parity in business. While the government may walk a fine constitutional line if they award incentives for female board directors, another solution could be as simple as compiling a list of companies that have no women on their board of directors for consumers to consider. 
Annalisa Barrett, a professor of finance at the University of San Diego, estimates that 377 California companies will have to make changes to their board makeup under the new legislation, which translates to roughly 684 women being added to board positions. 
This statistic shows how change is necessary.  With the power of social media and the instantaneous transmission of information, a list of companies with no women on their executive boards can be compiled and blasted over the Internet. The public could easily take action, for example, by creating a blacklist of companies to boycott. 
Based on the public support for the California bill, citizens should seek action. Nearly all Californians polled by The Boardlist — 95 percent — said that corporations are not doing enough to add more female directors. It is clear that Californians are dedicated to ensuring women are fairly represented. Therefore, they — as players in the free market — can and should take action to force companies to comply with their demands. This should be the solution, instead of the state’s restrictive measures on the free market. 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said that there would be enough women on the Supreme Court when all nine slots are filled by women. As someone who believes in gender equality and equal representation in all capacities and arenas, I agree. There need not be a set metric for what constitutes “enough” women on any judicial bench, or in any organization for that matter. 
Gender diversity is a necessary goal to strive for, but it is not the government’s job, nor should it be allowed to mandate its manifestation, especially not in the private sector. Rather, consumers should know that they can and should push for gender parity by voting with their dollar, and supporting companies that show commitment to the cause.

Alumnus Ryan Logsdon (left) and masters student Sean Gibbons (right) created Lighthaus, a system that features earthquake sensors in individual homes to provide early warnings. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
A  USC student and alumnus are heading to the Clinton Global Initiative University Conference this month after they teamed up to bring earthquake early warning detection kits to homes across Los Angeles.
Sean Gibbons, a student at the Marshall School of Business, met Viterbi School of Engineering alumnus Ryan Logsdon about a year ago on a platform meant to connect entrepreneurs and people with project ideas. 
“[We] met on campus and he told me about this idea he had for a way to use artificial intelligence and deep learning to detect earthquakes,” Gibbons said. “I thought it was awesome, so I jumped on board and the rest is history.”
Logsdon, who graduated in 2015, is the chief technology officer for the project, titled Lighthaus. He had the idea to create the system after learning that earthquakes could be “outpaced” by technology. Despite not having a background in geophysics, Logsdon holds a master’s degree in computer science with a concentration in intelligent robotics. He wrote a simulation of the system in just three nights. 
“I checked all my parameters and it didn’t make sense to me that you could do this and nobody is doing it,” Logsdon said.
Logsdon said that he then learned the United States Geological Survey is working on an early detection warning system, but that it is still in its testing phase.
The USGS system is a network of 400 high-quality ground motion sensors placed throughout California using the California Integrated Seismic Network, according to the USGS website. 
Lighthaus will feature sensors in individual homes. The company intends to privatize the earthquake early warning system, according to Gibbons, who serves as the CEO for Lighthaus.
“It’s essentially a device that you’re going to put into your home and plug into your wall and that device acts as a sensor that in combination with other devices in the area, forms sort of a network of sensors,” Gibbons said. “All of those are streaming data back to our central server.”
The system is able to remain at a cost of around $30 by using off-the-shelf parts and employing what Logsdon called “error-prone” software. 
“We take on less desirable hardware sensors and in exchange, we have to add in some sensors that work in real time so that way we can take the noise out of the filter,” Logsdon said. “You’d otherwise never be able to use these hardware for what we’re intending, so you pass it through some very simple filters and it pulls the data out that we require and that we need.”
Lighthaus, which recently incorporated, plans to give out 400 free sensors to homes around L.A. in order to test the system. The company plans to be subscription based, so those who have a paid subscription will receive warnings of up to 30 seconds.
Ron Silverton was a Viterbi Innovation Mentor to Logsdon and Gibbons and has continued to informally advise the duo. He was excited to work with Lighthaus because he believes it can positively impact many lives.
“They have a strong core team and a compelling product that I believe could make a real difference in helping to save lives,” Silverton wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
After winning several competitions that have been critical to launching Lighthaus, Logsdon and Gibbons are taking their project to the Clinton Global Initiative University Conference, which serves as a platform for undergraduate and graduate students to discuss innovative ideas. If the two raise the most money in their GoFundMe campaign, they will receive an award from former president Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea.  
Logsdon said he enjoys working on this problem because it’s fun. 
“I don’t really care that it’s not the most attractive because it’s not my field,” Logsdon said. “My field is robotics, and if you can sum up robotics in one sentence or one word it’s ‘error’ or ‘how to deal with errors’ and that’s what this problem’s all about.”

Fifty-one percent of voters over 65 showed more support for Democratic candidates compared to 45 percent of older voters supporting Republican candidates. (Photo courtesy of USC Dornsife)
Democratic candidates are gaining support from women and older American likely voters, making them more likely to win the U.S. House majority, according to a recent national poll by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times. 
The latest poll conducted from Aug. 22 to Sept. 24 showed that 51 percent of likely voters would support a Democratic candidate if the elections were held today compared to 41 percent for a Republican candidate. 
The poll surveyed slightly over 5,000 U.S. residents, including over 4,100 registered voters and over 2,500 likely midterm voters. It also showed that 57 percent of likely voters disapprove of President Donald Trump and 45 percent saw their vote in the upcoming election as a “statement of opposition” to Trump. 
Michael Murphy, co-director for USC Dornsife’s Center for the Political Future, told USC News that voters’ dislike for Trump is hurting Republicans’ chances of winning House seats.
“We now know from the data that President Trump is a drag on the midterm,” Murphy told USC News. “He has all of the problems of a president facing his first midterm. He is still trying to grab the primary rather than capitalizing on these other issues, like the economy.” 
Half of female voters saw their vote as an opposition to Trump, according to the poll. Compared with a previous poll from July and August, suburban women’s support of Democratic candidates grew nine points, giving Democrats a 61 percentage point advantage among likely female voters. 
“In the past, Republicans and Democrats alike have wooed suburban women through their identities as mothers, and this specific shift away from the Republican Party comes after the controversial images of immigrant children in detention hit the news,” gender studies and political science professor Hancock Alfaro told USC News. “Through their support of this policy, Republican candidates also became complicit in a policy of family separation.”
Likely voters ages 65 and older also showed more support for Democratic candidates, with 51 percent supporting Democrats compared to 45 percent of older likely voters supporting Republicans. Half of these respondents said that health care is a key issue that can swing their vote if a candidate doesn’t support their views.
Forty percent of likely voters supported building Trump’s border wall, while three out of four likely voters said they support a path to citizenship for immigrant children whose parents illegally brought them to live in the U.S.
“The vast majority [of Republican voters] said [immigration] is one of the most serious problems facing the country today,” Jill Darling, survey director for the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research told USC News. “However, we are not seeing any evidence that it is driving the ‘red wave’ that President Trump has predicted.”

Sophomore safety Bubba Bolden confirmed Monday that he has withdrawn from USC, after the University made his departure official Sunday.
Bolden wrote on Instagram that the University’s Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards found him guilty of violating a student code of conduct pertaining to underage drinking at an off-campus party.
“My behavior at the party was not reflective of my character,” Bolden wrote. “At this point, I’m 100% committed to ensuring that the lessons I’ve learned on and off the field will carry me to the next level.”
Bolden explained in the post that he was not charged with criminal activity and that a University official found him not to be a threat. Bolden added that the Title IX Office declined to open an investigation. 
“As the vibe at the party grew unfriendly, I left with several friends,” Bolden said in the post. “Approximately nine days afterward, the party hosts reported feeling threatened by me that night, which sparked a USC SJACS investigation.”
His SJACS-mandated suspension of 28 months was determined by when the party hosts are expected to graduate.
Bolden also apologized to the football program and thanked the staff and his teammates for their support.
“Although I certainly did not expect to leave USC under these circumstances, I depart with my integrity intact and stronger than ever as I face a bright horizon,” he wrote.
Bolden was named the starting safety alongside senior Marvell Tell III for the season opener against UNLV before his indefinite suspension in late August. The loss of Bolden, along with redshirt freshman Isaiah Pola-Mao to a season-ending shoulder injury, has left the Trojans depleted at the safety position. True freshman Talanoa Hufanga has taken over the reigns since Pola-Mao’s departure.
Bolden was a four-star prospect out of Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas. He was named the seventh-ranked safety nationally and Nevada’s third-ranked prospect for the class of 2017.
Bolden played in 13 games as a freshman backup in 2017, missing only the Stanford game in Week Two due to a sprained knee. He amassed eight tackles throughout the season but served primarily on special teams.

Two Greek fraternities are barred from hosting social activities as they face an interim suspension while the University investigates alleged hazing violations. 
According to USC’s Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development site, Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi Sigma Kappa were put on interim suspension Friday.
These are the latest Greek organizations to face suspension after Alpha Epsilon Pi and Pi Kappa Phi were put on suspension last month for similar alleged violations. Sigma Delta Alpha and Tau Kappa Epsilon have official social suspensions for Fall 2018 due to prior completed investigations.
The Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Council instructed Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi Sigma Kappa  to cancel the parties they were planning to host that night, according to Sigma Alpha Mu Vice President Matthew Parker. 
Parker said that a representative from the FSLC would provide them with a notice explaining the alleged violations and interim suspension. 
The notice, sent by Assistant Vice Provost for Student Engagement Monique Allard, cited violations of hazing regulations and health and safety codes, Parker said. The Daily Trojan was unable to confirm the contents of the notice by the time of publication.
However, in a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said that it takes allegations of hazing seriously and these current allegations are under investigation.
“Organizations that are being investigated for alleged violations of the code of conduct can be instructed to suspend or modify social activities pending results of an investigation,” the University wrote.
Parker explained that the fraternity was unsure what codes the fraternity broke and that they had not heard from Allard on Monday.
“We’re not sure what they’re accusing of us, but I’m sure we didn’t do it,” Parker said. “They’re bringing on the suspension for not much reason and there’s not a lot of transparency with telling us what we’re accused of.”
The prohibition of social activities is forcing Sigma Alpha Mu to cancel a fundraiser meant to pay the medical bills of the organization’s sous chef who was diagnosed with cancer and recently had surgery, according to Parker.
“It is unclear why they can’t make an exception for those events,” Parker said. “Canceling a party, I can totally understand if they want to cancel social events. But I don’t see why canceling a philanthropy … is such a bad thing.”
USC Interfraternity Council declined to comment. The President of Phi Sigma Kappa directed the Daily Trojan to FSLD and declined to comment.
