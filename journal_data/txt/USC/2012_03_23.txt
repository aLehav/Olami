USC junior forward Ari Stewart was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia last month in Maricopa County, Arizona State University Police Department spokesman Jim Hardina confirmed to the Daily Trojan Friday morning.
Stewart, 21, was arrested by ASU police on Feb. 24 at 8:40 p.m. MST and released by the Maricopa County’s Sheriff’s Office the following day.
The USC men’s basketball team was in Tempe, Ariz., for a Pac-12 contest against Arizona State on Feb. 25. The Trojans had faced Arizona in Tucson on Feb. 23.
ASU submitted the case to the Maricopa County attorney’s office on Wednesday, requesting charges of marijuana possession and possession of drug paraphernalia be filed.
“I’m well aware of situation and have been for some time,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “It’s an internal matter. Ari will suffer some consequences. I wish it wouldn’t have happened. I like Ari. It’s not an indication of his character or what kind of person he is.”
O’Neill would not specify what disciplinary actions Stewart would face.
Stewart, a 6-foot-7, 205-pound wingman, transferred from Wake Forrest to USC last April.
He sat out this season with the Trojans, per NCAA transfer rules. He would, though, be eligible to play next year and has been expected to help revive the program, which finished with a single-season record for losses with 26.
As a sophomore for the Demon Deacons in 2011, he averaged 8.5 points and 4.4 rebounds through 32 games. The previous season, he led the ACC in 3-point shooting, while averaging 7.3 points per contest.
 
Did anyone ask if he had a valid MM card?

With the luxury of downloading, which enables music-lovers to purchase only an artist’s best songs, it’s remarkable to find an album that can be played from start to finish. As though they understand how the market works, record companies use radio and music videos to enthuse audiences about one or two hit songs before releasing an album that is otherwise unpromising.
But new outlets may change that mentality. Because of Broadway’s and Hollywood’s fresh demand for narrative-driven songs and albums —or music that tells a story with consistency in sound and quality— the music world may find itself focusing on artists with the vocal or songwriting skills to outlast brief radio time.
Using talented artists for new stories seems to recall old ideas of former success. The West End in London, for example, was highly successful with its production of Mamma Mia!, which featured hit ABBA songs combined into a single story-line. Since its opening in 1999, the production has earned over 2 billion dollars, some of which is the result of a profitable film of the same name as well as an additional production in New York.
Now it seems as though Broadway is attempting to capitalize on this previously lucrative scheme. With recent shows like Once, a musical based on the soundtrack from the 2006 film and American Idiot, a rock musical based off of the 2004 Green Day album of the same name, Broadway combines the theater and the music worlds, which provides for more than twice the success of a regular album, much less a single download. In addition to the usual financial gains from concert tickets, T-shirts and other memorabilia, a CD that has been adapted for the stage has the added bonus of making money from cast-recorded albums, musical fashion and additional theater ticket sales —all possessing strong potential to increase a music empire.
This ideology extends to the film industry. With original film soundtracks garnering as much popularity as regular albums, it’s easy to understand why Hollywood would attempt to incorporate more music into the medium. Take, for instance, the 2007 film Across the Universe, which strung together a plot based on Beatles songs. The movie grossed $29 million worldwide, not including soundtrack sales.
But what Green Day, ABBA and the Beatles really have in common is not their influences in different art fields, but the common bond of an audience willing to listen to tried-and-true songs in a different medium. Somehow, with songs possessing a wider range of topics than partying and sex, these artists find their hard work timeless as well as financially successful.
Who knows? Perhaps the Adeles and Mary J. Bliges of today will venture out into these new artistic arenas and force their less-talented competition to try and keep up —if only for monetary gain.
