Tuesday marked the 20th anniversary of the creation of World Wide Web. The organization responsible for building the Internet, CERN, also created the Large Hadron Collider, which may or may not have broken the speed of light in 2011.
British scientist Tim Berners-Lee drafted a series of proposals in 1989 that eventually led to the production of prototype software in CERN’s laboratories. Within a year, the first website came online, and soon science communities and universities throughout Europe and the United States began using the new system in their organizations.
The most significant moment of the Internet’s evolution, however, happened in 1994, better known as “the year of the Internet,” when the International World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded with the primary goal of keeping the internet open to everyone in the world.
Imagine a world where only governments or corporations were able to use the Internet. For better or worse, the passion that those with the W3C displayed toward accessibility directly led to the world we live in today.
CERN has reestablished the first-ever website in honor of its anniversary. It can be found here.

Brandon Spencer, 20, the suspect in an on-campus shooting on Oct. 31, appeared in court on Tuesday at the Los Angeles criminal court building Tuesday for a pretrial hearing, which determined that his trial will begin within 30 days after May 29.
Spencer, who is unaffiliated with the university, pled not guilty on March 28 to four counts of attempted murder during his felony arraignment. He was arrested Nov. 5. On Oct. 31, a suspect opened fire into a crowd and injured four non-USC affiliated students near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Spencer plead not guilty to give up his right to a speedy trial. As a result, the next pretrial conference is scheduled for May 29, Judge Terry A. Bork said.
Bork said defense attorney and prosecutors will be given more time for the discovery process to present further evidence.
During the March 28 pretrial hearing, the judge also issued an order that restricted photographs or recordings to be taken of the defendant.
James M. Simmons, Spencer’s attorney, urged the court to consider an order to show cause, a procedure that allows a party to explain something to the court, following the release of a photograph of the defendant on Annenberg TV News’ website.
Simmons argued that ATVN violated the court order and presented a still image from the news station’s website to the judge.
Bork, however, said the picture was not enough information to provide cause to believe that the previous order had been violated. Bork left it to the counsel to provide further information to the court regarding who broadcast the image, after which the court would take any additional steps necessary.
Bork also noted that going forward, no photographic recordings or broadcasting of the hearings in the courtroom will be allowed without further order of the court.

As Sen. John McCain walked into the USC Schwarzenegger Institute’s bipartisan summit on immigration reform, he stopped before a demonstration of about 15 students from the School of Social Work.
Looking ahead · Sen. Michael Bennet (left to right), Sen. John McCain and ABC News Radio correspondent Ann Compton discuss immigration reform with USC students and faculty on Tuesday at the USC Schwarzenegger Institute’s bipartisan summit. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“Let’s keep families together,” the group chanted in rally of  support for comprehensive immigration reform.
McCain (R-Ariz.) waved his hand and made his way into Town and Gown, the site of the four-and-a-half hour symposium that featured political leaders and immigration experts, ranging from former President of Mexico Vicente Fox to former U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.
The forum fell just weeks after a bipartisan group of United States senators, known as the Gang of Eight, unveiled a bill to address the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. The proposal provides a path toward citizenship if border tightens. The legislation is expected to be voted on in June, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said at the forum.
In his opening remarks, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the institute’s namesake, said the Gang of Eight has “brought the chutzpah back” to Congress.
McCain said he has lobbied Republicans by emphasizing the importance of immigration reform as not just the right thing to do, but also as a political necessity, during a panel with Ann Compton, a White House correspondent for ABC News Radio, and Bennet.
“I also appeal to their base instincts and that is to review for them the percent of the Hispanic vote that we got in the last several elections, which is dramatically dropping,” McCain said. “If we don’t do this, you can’t begin the conversation with our Hispanic voters and all you have to do is the math.”
With the event, Gang of Eight members McCain and Bennet continued to make the case for their reform proposal on the road.
“The reason why we will be able to succeed here is because there has never been a coalition like has been assembled by this: business, labor, agriculture, unions, the Catholic Church, evangelicals,” McCain said.
Though some have attacked the pathway to citizenship as “amnesty,” Bennet said that this facet of the bill was not as contentious as the debate to iron out a deal on agriculture workers.
“Many people describe this as the most controversial part of the discussion,” Bennet said. “This was not the most controversial part of this discussion for the Group of Eight because there was general agreement, I think, that we live in a country where we don’t have a sub-class of people.
During the question and answer period, some students expressed concern about how a pathway to citizenship might negatively impact the economy.
Bennet addressed this issue by arguing that reform might, in fact, benefit the economic situation for American workers.
“Compared to today, the fact that we’ve had 11 million people that are in the shadows in this county is not good for American workers,” Bennet said. “It definitely depresses wages if you have people working for cash or under the table — outside of the law.”
The second panel, featuring Gutierrez as well as professors Dowell Myers and Pierette Hondagneu-Sotelo, discussed immigration reform, specifically as it relates to the economy.
Myers said new workers must fill the positions that open when people retire. He noted that the baby boomers account for 60 million of all workers, or 40 percent of the workforce right now.
“Over 20 years’ time, about 90 percent will be into retirement,” Myers said. “In the pipeline, we need reinforcement, and immigration is our secret weapon.”
The forum took an international perspective during the third panel, which featured a conversation between Fox, who served as Mexico’s president from 2000-06, and Univision 34 anchor Gabriela Teissier.
“Most of the discussion today has been inward — has been within the woods looking at the problems here — but a lot of things are going on around the world,” Fox said, noting rapid economic development in Asia and Latin America.
Fox reiterated his position that building a wall carries the wrong message with regard to the U.S. immigration system.
“Walls don’t work,” Fox said. “Walls, and again I say it with all respect, reflect fear.”
He also emphasized that, though immigration reform will benefit Mexico, the primary aspiration is to close the economic gap between Mexico and the United States. This has already begun, Fox said, citing the faster growth of Mexico’s economy and salaries.
“So sooner or later, that gap is going to unravel and I think that will be the best situation for North America,” he said.
Mikey Geragos, former Undergraduate Student Government president, said the forum provided a glimpse into the process behind drafting a comprehensive immigration bill.
“It was interesting to get a little more detail on the inner-working of the Gang of Eight, seeing what some of the sticking points were and how they overcame those,” Geragos said.
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and USC Trustee and former Congresswoman Jane Harman also delivered remarks at the symposium.
Villaraigosa reported that one out of 10 Angelenos is undocumented and said that although the bill is not perfect, it’s a step in the right direction.
“I learned a long time ago, don’t let the perfect get in the way of the good,” Villaraigosa said.
Though students viewed it as an informative event, the day was not without a good deal of political humor.
In his introductory remarks, Jack Knott, dean of the USC Sol Price School of Public  Policy, joked that he has his own agenda for reform -— to include a clause that immigrants can run for president.
“Let’s please narrow it down so it doesn’t go crazy,” Schwarzenegger responded. “You have to be Austrian-born. You have to be a body builder. And you have to be an actor.”

The Los Angeles Fire Department responded Tuesday morning to an alert reporting heavy smoke on the University Park Campus.
Emergency · The Los Angeles Fire Department responded Tuesday to a report of a small fire at Vivian Hall, located on Watt Way. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
 
The firefighters were called to the fourth floor of Vivian Hall, located on Watt Way, at approximately 9:40 a.m, according to LAFD spokesman Brian Humphrey.
The crews were able to quickly extinguish the flames in under 10 minutes.
The incident was a result of an overheated water cooler, according to Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning Specialist Steven Goldfarb.
“Some kind of heating element in one of those water dispensers caught fire,” Goldfarb said.
“The fire was quickly extinguished by the fire extinguishers and the building was quickly evacuated. The building remained closed for several hours.”
No injuries or damages were reported but the incident is still under investigation.
“We’re looking into the cause of why the machine overheated,” Goldfarb said. “It’s an isolated situation.”
University spokesman Carl Marziali said the USC Schwarzenegger Institute’s immigration forum at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, where former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arizona Sen. John McCain gathered, was not affected.

Michael Parks, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and former  Los Angeles Times editor, will lead the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism as interim director for the second time, Annenberg announced Tuesday.
The decision comes after Douglas Foster, a Northwestern University professor, withdrew from the director position after accepting it Friday, according to the Los Angeles Times.
This will be Parks’ second time as interim director for the school, serving in the position before in 2001 after being a part of the Annenberg faculty for a year. In March 2002, he was named director and served until June 2008, when outgoing director Geneva Overholser was selected.
Overholser announced in November that she will step down as director in June, at which point the school launched a recruitment campaign for her successor. The search for a new director will continue as Parks heads the school.
Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III said Parks’ experience will positively impact the school and its students.
“Michael Parks is a real star,” Wilson said in a statement. “His extraordinary wisdom and experience will be invaluable to our students, faculty and staff.”
Early in his career, Parks reported internationally and won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his coverage of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. He served as the Los Angeles Times editor from 1997 to 2000.
Parks said he looks forward to returning to Annenberg at a time of great change, including the construction of the Wallis Annenberg Hall, which is slated to open in fall 2014.
“We have great students and a terrific faculty that is looking forward to taking full advantage of this wonderful new building and all the opportunities that it will provide in developing an even more innovative program for our students,” Parks said. “I’m proud to lead the USC Annenberg Journalism School as we move closer to this remarkable milestone.”
During Parks’ first term, he guided the creation and adoption of a new core reporting curriculum in print, broadcast and new media programs. He also expanded the international reporting programs and developed the school’s focus on covering diverse communities.

Well folks, it’s that time of year again when the semester winds down and leaves you wondering what even happened in the last four months.
Throughout the semester, we’ve looked at the factors that have inspired kickass new songs, artist influences, bands straying from the path, time warps back into the ’90s (was I the only one who enjoyed those?) and so much more. We’ve also explored patterns and themes that make up much of the music that we hear, as different as all the styles might be.
For this week’s New Noise, though, let’s throw those themes behind. The only connection these songs have with each other is plain awesomeness. The four garage bands featured are taking the independent genre in new directions with unique sounds and compelling lyrics.
The summer is crawling toward us and the inevitable restlessness that comes along with the warming weather is mighty hard to ignore. It’s the last week of school — how about we just turn off our minds for a hot minute and enjoy some music?
The Family Rain: “Trust Me… I’m A Genius”
Who says family members can’t work together? Besides the Gallagher brothers from Oasis. And the Davies brothers from the Kinks. And the Reid brothers from Jesus and Mary Chain.
OK, point taken. Luckily, the Family Rain has (so far) been an anomaly to the sibling rivalry rule.
The band is made up of three brothers — including a pair of twins — from Bath, England, and plays raw and in-your-voice old school rock and roll, soaking all its songs in a bluescore vibe. The band sounds along the lines of Cold War Kids and Jack White, but with more of a hip-hop edge, almost.
“Trust Me… I’m A Genius” is not only what this column should have been called, but it’s also an epic new song from the Family Rain. The metronomic piano intro that bleeds into the verse is heavily reminiscent of a Cold War Kids song, but overall, the track plays like what the Black Keys would sound like if the band stopped being so mellow and actually got pissed off once in a while — blues rock with a kick (to the face).
Childhood: “Solemn Skies”
Let’s stay on the Atlantic for a bit longer and check out Childhood. The London indie-rock band has a sound that is so authentically ’90s shoegaze that it’s unbelievable that they just formed in 2011.
Its latest release, “Solemn Skies,” is anything but solemn.
The song is wonderfully breezy and carefree, sounding like a lovechild of a Horrors song and an old school Charlatans tune. The guitars are big and loud, with wistful reverb creating a slick veneer over the entire sound of the track. Building up easy and slow, the song erupts into a euphoric mess of a finale, with dreamy guitars, drums and vocals joining together for some beautiful anarchy.
The track takes the listener on a blissful ride for five minutes and 17 seconds, in which everything is truly (and happily) forgotten. “Solemn Skies” is from Solemn Skies, set to be released on 10-inch on June 10, with “Semester” featured as a B-side.
Deerhunter: “Sleepwalking”
Deerhunter has been around for 12 years now, and the band has dipped its toes into numerous genres and influences over the years. Noise rock, ambient, psychedelic rock, shoegaze and post-punk — Deerhunter has been there and done that about five times over.
Its latest album, Monomania, is out on May 7 and finds the band heading downstairs to the garage to whip out some perfectly crafted “nocturnal garage” (a term coined by lead singer/co-founder/musical genius Bradford Cox).
“Sleepwalking” is as much of a reverie a song can be and perfectly lives up to its title. The faraway echoes of the instruments and vocals carry away the listener to a tropical, aural paradise of reverb and musical ricochets. The Strokes-like guitars dance around in the background, and Cox’s vocals are pleasantly nonchalant. Deerhunter definitely has a doozy with this one.
Thee Oh Sees: “Devil Again”
San Francisco’s Thee Oh Sees have been rocking people’s socks right off since 1997, and its newest tunes show that it doesn’t plan on slowing down anytime soon. Though the band has just recently released its seventh album Floating Coffin, Thee Oh Sees’ latest song comes courtesy of a compilation album.
Anyone familiar with the hilarious and one-of-a-kind ways of TV’s Adult Swim network know that they’re not just amazing at airing brilliant comedy shows, but also pretty great at throwing out solid compilation albums. Its latest compilation album is Garage Swim which, not surprisingly, features garage rock to blow your mind with.
“Devil Again” is the teaser track to the compilation (officially out on May 6), which also features garage regulars such as the Black Lips, King Tuff, Mikal Cronin, King Khan, Cheap Time and much more. The real star of “Devil Again” is the paranoid-sounding keyboard that echoes in the background and just doesn’t let up. With a wonderfully catchy and simple “ba-ba” chorus, the song is impossible not to dance to and has definitely upped the standards of the compilation album.

In Jeff Nichols’s beautiful and sprawling new film Mud, the river defines everyone’s lives.

It is at once innately awe-inspiring, dangerous and murky. It brings with its waters both trash and treasure, though it’s sometimes hard to tell the two apart. And perhaps it is what gives the film a timeless quality to it, as if it just happens to take place in the present but could easily have happened long ago.
Whatever decade it was set in, however, the storyline still rings true.
The basic premise is simple: Two 14-year-old boys, Ellis and Neckbone, find a boat suspended in a tree on an island on the Mississippi River that they want to claim as their own. They soon find, however, that a mysterious man named Mud is living there, unable or unwilling to leave the island, and needs the boys’ help.
The movie portrays love in various forms and stages. Ellis (Tye Sheridan) falls in love for the first time with an older girl and experiences infatuation in the beginning, but things soon turn bitter. Blinded by love, Mud (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself doing anything for Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), regardless of whether it’s stupid, dangerous or horrible. And Ellis’ parents (played by the wonderful Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson) struggle with a weary love that is slipping, and needs to change.
McConaughey plays Mud, a larger-than-life character, in a very real and human way, capturing the dichotomy of the role extremely fluidly. He might be a dangerous and untrustworthy liar, but Mud is also innocent, loyal and loving. McConaughey plays these two sides as if they were one in the same.
Mud might as well still be stuck in adolescence, the way he idealizes love at the beginning of the movie. This is undoubtedly part of why Ellis is so drawn to him at first, because Ellis is also idealistic when it comes to love. In this way, the film almost stands as a dual coming-of-age story for Ellis and Mud, with both characters being forced to come to grips with the reality and harshness of love.
The acting in the film is universally top-notch. Even legendary veteran actors such as Sam Shepherd and Joe Don Baker (who play Tom Blankenship  and King respectively) don’t outshine young newcomers Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland. The two young boys are especially captivating and natural; Sheridan as Ellis particularly carries the film and gives it a confident, heart-filled and believable center.
The moments where Ellis and Mud snap into action without hesitation, yet with clarity of mind, are some of the most captivating in the film. For example, when Ellis sees from across the street an older boy harass the girl he likes, he instinctively walks over, with no regard for traffic, and punches the boy in the face, as if that were the only sane reaction.
These moments are the ones that show how similar Ellis and Mud are, in that they are both inherently protectors.
Lofland, who plays Neckbone, and Michael Shannon, who plays his uncle, are responsible for most of the comic relief in the movie. Lofland is like a young River Phoenix with a gap tooth and a frank but filthy mouth, and almost every single line out of his mouth is hilarious. Shannon, who was in Nichols’ previous two films, shines here in a small but important role as a reluctant parental figure ill-equipped to deal with children.
Watching the movie, it is hard to believe that this is only director Jeff Nichols’ third film. The filmmaking here is so self-assured, the style distinct and the pace measured. Nichols’ previous films, Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter, have similar pacing; they all build slowly but engagingly to violent explosions. But there is a definite progression in quality and confident directing from each film to the next. Nichols is restrained and never rushes to his finish in Mud, but when he does get to the finish, he lets it all run wild.
Nearly everything that happens in the movie has a payoff, even seemingly unimportant details such as Michael Shannon’s character adding lights to his homemade diving helmet and the maybe-false, maybe-not stories Mud tells Ellis and Neckbone. For this reason, the film is dense, but not impenetrable. Despite its 130 minute running time, there is very little fat in the movie and it never feels excessively long.
The film looks and sounds gorgeous. The music is beautiful and magical, but also subtle. The 35 mm film photography, for one, is breathtaking and adds to the classic American feel of the film. But maybe more significantly, the cinematography balances grand wide shots and intimate detailed close ups just as the narrative does. Mud is both a deeply personal and a deeply universal film, and that isn’t a contradiction. The one leads to the other.
Simply put, this is quite possibly the best movie in American theaters right now.
What a well written review. I saw the film last evening and feel you’ve done an excellent job discussing the whole picture. Thank you!

Walking through the door, you can’t help but admire the colorful banner hanging from the ceiling that reads, “Life’s short, eat cookies.”
This simple but sweet mantra sums up the reason Courtney Cowan, owner of Milk Jar Cookies, decided to open one of Los Angeles’ newest bakeries.
In 2005, Cowan started an online company called Sweet Cheeks Cookies. For seven years she baked and sold cookies through the website, building up a fan base and working up the courage to open a storefront.
Finally, after re-naming her enterprise and convincing her husband to take the leap of chance with her, Milk Jar Cookies opened its doors to an eager crowd that had lined up all the way down Wilshire Boulevard to get a cookie (or two … or 10).
“It was crazy, but fun,” Cowan said, recalling the grand opening of the store. “There was a line from the minute we opened to the time we closed.”
Since then, the cookie-crazed customers have settled down a little, though a rush of people impatient to satisfy an afternoon sweet craving usually causes a line to form around 2:00 p.m. After that point, the store usually remains busy until the dinner hour begins.
“It’s hard keeping up with the demand. We bake all day long and still run out of certain flavors,” Cowan said.
Sachin Doshi has already returned to Milk Jar Cookies several times since it opened.
“Everyone who’s come here agrees it’s their favorite cookie place,” Doshi said.
While waiting to purchase a dozen cookies to bring to a friend’s party, Doshi explained why these cookies beat the rest for her.
“They’re always soft,” Doshi said. “Even if you wait awhile before you eat them, you can re-heat them and it’s like they’re fresh out of the oven.”
That fresh-from-the-oven, warm aroma permeates the air of the shop, blending with the cozy décor like chocolate chips into cookie batter. From the chipped paint on the wood paneling to the antiqued doors and windows that adorn the walls, Milk Jar Cookies has the feeling of a well-worn yet stylishly shabby-chic home.
The decorations range from cheerful paper lanterns hanging in the front window to whimsically innovative chandeliers made of glass milk bottles dangling from the ceiling.
The cookies themselves, stacked on pastel-colored cake stands with scalloped, lacy edges, are a special delight for the eye and from the quintessential chocolate chip to the banana split, Milk Jar Cookies has more than a dozen flavors to choose from.
Despite her creative culinary concotions, Cowan has never had professional culinary training. However, she has a long history of experimenting with cookie flavors.
“As a little girl, I used to bake all the time. Then, as a teenager, I came up with my own recipe,” Cowan said.
She found her inspiration for many cookie flavors, such as rocky road or mint chocolate, from ice cream shops, while others came from family preferences.
“My dad used to always eat banana splits,” said Cowan. “So I thought I’d try to make it into a cookie flavor and people seem to like it.”
Everything about the Milk Jar Cookie experience is a delight. The cookies are served on tastefully mismatched china teacup saucers, and a tall glass of cold milk, served in miniature glass milk bottles with colorful striped straws, pairs perfectly with a Cowan’s baked treats. While shipping and delivery options are available, it’s worth your time to walk into the store and peruse the glass case of cookies and linger awhile.
For those interested in the baking process, Cowan can be seen in the kitchen hard at work. The windowpanes that overlook the kitchen, laced with cracked paint, give you the sense you’re peeking into her home. And from this viewpoint, one can see “ol’ sweet cheeks,” the oven in which all the cookies are baked, which was named for Cowan’s original online cookie endeavor.
Now that she has a physical store, Cowan is determined to keep her business small and stay very hands-on with her products.
“I love people,” said Cowan. “I want to be able to craft an experience for them and to see them enjoy the cookies.”
Though gluten- and nut-free options are available, the baking process is done with shared equipment, so those with serious allergies should be wary.
And at $3.00 a cookie, making a habit of eating these goods could become expensive, but the cookies are fairly large in size and undoubtedly worth it in taste.

With the regular season and the Pac-12 championships in the books, the USC men’s and women’s tennis teams are poised to capitalize on two relatively successful years by making deep runs in the 2013 NCAA championships.
Leading the charge · Junior Ray Sarmiento (above) and the No. 5 seeded men’s tennis team have won four straight national championships heading into this year’s NCAA tournament, which begins on May 10. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The USC men’s squad (23-4) is accustomed to going into the tournament as the favorites. This time around, the Trojans are seeded at the No. 4 slot as they look to take an unprecedented fifth consecutive NCAA championship.
The Women of Troy (21-2), fresh off their second-straight Pac-12 team title, will have the No. 5 seed in the women’s bracket after reaching the semifinals last year.
Both teams have the luxury of beginning the tournament at home and will host first- and second-round matchups at Marks Stadium from May 10-12.
The Trojans and the Women of Troy will each face Sacramento State on day one. The action begins for the men at 11 a.m. on May 10 while the women kick off a day later at noon.
A victory for the Trojans will set up a second-round matchup against the winner of San Diego and Alabama, teams both coached by former USC assistants, while the Women of Troy will face either UC Irvine or San Jose State if they advance.
Two wins for either the men or the women will book a ticket to the Round of 16 at the Atkins Tennis Center/Khan Outdoor Tennis Complex in Urbana, Ill.
USC head coach Peter Smith and the Trojans aim to make a strong push with seven men ranked in the top-100 International Tennis Association singles rankings.
Former Trojans Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen have been staples of the Trojans’ last four championships, but now that both have graduated, No. 4 junior Emilio Gomez and No. 17 junior Ray Sarmiento have stepped up to lead a young roster consisting of only juniors, sophomores and freshmen.
Standing alongside the two are No. 34 sophomore Roberto Quiroz, No. 65 sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, No. 80 sophomore Eric Johnson, No. 93 sophomore Jonny Wang and No. 94 junior Michael Grant.
For the Women of Troy, five players are ranked in singles, including No. 2 sophomore Sabrina Santamaria, No. 9 senior Danielle Lao, No. 32 sophomore Zoë Scandalis, No. 76 sophomore Gabriella DeSimone and No. 112 sophomore Giuliana Olmos.
The women’s team also features the two-time Pac-12 doubles champions in Santamaria and junior Kaitlyn Christian, who are ranked No. 2 in doubles together.
With 13 consecutive wins behind them, the Women of Troy and USC head coach Richard Gallien have momentum on their side. The team hopes to ride the hot streaks of Santamaria and Christian, who have won 21 and 13 straight in singles, respectively, and 30 straight in doubles as a pair.
The men’s team is coming off of a 4-2 loss to No. 1 UCLA in the Pac-12 title game on April 27, but have won 11 of their last 13 matches. Three of the Trojans’ losses this season have come at the hands of the Bruins, who hold the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.
California, Stanford and Washington have also been invited to the men’s tournament, while Arizona, California, Stanford and UCLA have received bids to the women’s tournament.

Four USC women’s water polo players have at least one more trophy to take home after winning this past weekend’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament: Junior two-meter Hannah Buckling and junior goalie Flora Bolonyai, sophomore Monica Vavic and freshman Anni Espar were named to the all-tournament team for their outstanding performances in the three games.
Strong showing · Freshman Anni Espar (above) scored at least two goals in every game she played during the MPSF tournament. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Buckling was also named MVP of the tournament after leading the charge against the top-seeded Stanford Cardinal in the final game.
Buckling, who scored two goals in the opening game against CSU Bakersfield and then another against Arizona State in the semis, made certain to save her best performance for the final act.
After being held scoreless in her last showing against the Cardinal, Buckling burst out of the gates scoring two goals in the first quarter to help the Women of Troy jump to a 5-0 lead. She would add a goal apiece in the third and fourth quarters to lock down the 11-7 victory; her four goals on the day led all players in scoring.
Vavic, who has been a prolific scorer all season for the Women of Troy, did not disappoint in the biggest tournament of the season thus far. She put together a hat trick in each game, leading all USC scorers in the tournament with nine total goals. All three of her goals in the Stanford game came in the first half, draining the defending national champions of their confidence early in the matchup. With her selection, Vavic has now been named to the MPSF all-tournament team in both of her appearances.
Espar, playing in her first MPSF tournament, made her presence known in each game with two goals against each team. Bolonyai anchored the defense, averaging 9.3 saves per game, including nine big saves in the final game — one of which came on a 5-meter penalty-shot attempt.
The outstanding performance of these four players in the MPSF tournament, along with the rest of the USC squad, helped to earn the Women of Troy the top seed in the NCAA tournament. The tournament will be held in Cambridge, Mass., and begins on May 10.

Chinese Wushu was a fighting and defending technique during war time thousands years ago. In the modern society, Wushu lost its function in fighting, but transformed into a type of art performance. Wushu players call their weapons as instruments, and practice with music and beats. USC Wushu Nation cooperates with USC Kazan Taiko creating a unique performance to experiment the mix of Wushu and music.

When news broke on Monday that Jason Collins was the first active athlete to come out as gay in a major sports league, there were three basic reactions on television, social media and elsewhere.
Reaction one: Overwhelming support. Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, David Stern, even President Barack Obama congratulated Collins for coming out.
Reaction two: Complaints that the news is not really sports-related and thus, does not matter. A typical response goes something similar to this: “I don’t care about gay people in sports. Let’s talk about Tim Tebow getting cut from the Jets!”
Reaction three: Disapproval of Collins’ revelation. Either through passive-aggressive means, e.g. Golden State Warriors head coach Mark Jackson saying he’d pray for Collins’ family or by expressing in more direct terms that what Collins did was wrong.
Reaction one gave me hope for Collins and other gay athletes who choose to come out in the future. To have the backing of some of the biggest names in basketball — not to mention the president of the United States — shows how far we’ve come as a country in the last 10 years alone.
Reaction two gave me pause. Beyond Collins’ admission, there’s a bigger dynamic at work. Sports have long served as the “bubble boy” of our guilty pleasures.
We watch the Trojans play football on Saturdays to unwind from school and social anxieties and forget about everything else. After the Boston Marathon bombings, the singing of the national anthem at a Bruins game showed solidarity in light of a horrific tragedy.
The arena allows people to come together in an increasingly divisive world to cheer for a common purpose. I love that about sports. But I’m not naive enough to think the social issues of the day will never matter on the basketball court or the baseball field.
Unfortunately, plenty of others appear to be that naive, which goes back to the second reaction I observed.
I’m not on a witch hunt for homophobes — most of them identified themselves as such in their responses to Bryant and others on Twitter. But there’s an underlying sense of intolerance in the forceful “who cares?” that seemed to be popping up so often over the last 48 hours.
The Supreme Court is considering two major cases regarding same-sex marriage. Rhode Island is about to be the 10th state to give same-sex couples the recognition they deserve. For the first time, we’ve had a sitting president endorse marriage equality.
And you don’t think it’s a big deal that an athlete who plays basketball in front of millions of Americans has come out as gay? Really?
I will concede this much: Jason Collins is a pretty bad NBA player.
Over spring break, my girlfriend and I got tickets to a Wizards-Lakers game at the Staples Center (I’m a Wizards fan, in case you were wondering). I was alarmed to find out in the pregame starting lineups that center Emeka Okafor was sitting out with an injury, and Collins was filling in his place. He finished with two points and four fouls in 13 minutes.
But that hardly matters here. Detractors are quick to point out that he barely leaves the bench, as if that changes something. It doesn’t. Collins could be the worst player on an NBA roster next season, and he’d arguably still be the most important.
There are an estimated nine million LGBT Americans, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA. You’re playing into silly stereotypes if you don’t think a large group of those individuals, especially children and teens involved in sports, aren’t going to look up to the guy.
Collins has paved the way for future gay athletes across the country. More than that, he’s placed himself in the middle of a national debate that we need to have.
This brings me to the third reaction I observed: those who had no qualms about expressing their distaste with Collins’ announcement.
I’m not going to go on a tangent about tolerance or homophobia. Someday, probably in a generation or two, those archaic viewpoints will die out.
What I do have a problem with is the men and women who feel they’re being attacked for their beliefs when they speak out against homosexuality.
When ESPN commentator Chris Broussard made a fool of himself on national television on Monday by essentially calling gay and heterosexual individuals who engage in pre-marital sex non-Christians, he stepped beyond the cliche “hate the sin, love the sinner” response and outright offended a large group of people.
Even worse, after he issued a surely ESPN-forced half-apology on Twitter, he posted a more personal message to his followers: “Thanks 2 all 4 your support. It’s meant a gr8t deal 2 me & helped me remain strong. Much love!”
Broussard, Tim Brando and other high-profile sports pundits who chose to weigh in with criticism aren’t heroes to some special cause like their supporters think they are. There’s a reason more than half of Americans now favor gay marriage. Broussard can pretend he’s in a persecuted minority, that he has to “remain strong” in the face of adversity.
Guess who was in that persecuted minority not even a decade ago? Supporters of the LGBT community.
The total acceptance of LGBT individuals in our society is only a matter of time. Collins deserves to be lauded as a hero and pioneer for leading the inclusion of openly gay athletes in professional sports.
Hopefully, the first time he enters a basketball game next season, he’ll be greeted with the cheers he ought to receive.
And after that, maybe, just maybe, more Americans will realize sexual orientation should never be an obstacle to becoming a professional athlete, nor should it matter when it comes to coexisting with a close-knit group of teammates.

Homosexuality is not deserving of the approbation of man. We can not overlook condemning those, who, through their own bad use of their faculties, are vicious to the good and perfection of the human system.
All members of society are interested in the due observance of the Laws of Nature, hence they have all a right to praise or condemn another man’s actions according as they are conformable or contrary to these laws. They have even a kind of obligation in this respect, lest men be wanting in their duty to society and to individuals, were they not to testify, at least by their approbation or censure, the esteem they have for probity and virtue, and their aversion, on the contrary, to iniquity and vice.
Homosexuals today are the vicious oppressors of liberty. They are the malevolent bigots driven by their own prideful prejudices into seeking vengeance; whether it be by slandering anyone with whom they disagree by labeling them a “homophobe”, demanding the criminalization of anyone who refuses them service, mandatory indoctrination of our youth by the State, or the destruction of religious charities and institutions; their agenda violates the very maxims of Natural Law leaving them only the tyranny of legislative oppression as their ONLY justification.
Extremely well written. Good job Alex!! Thank you.
Couldn’t agree more.

As Undergraduate Student Government Senate met for its last meeting of the academic year Tuesday, the new senators looked toward the future in implementing their goals and plans.
Since the beginning of its term on April 2, the senate has passed two resolutions. One resolution advocated for the administration to provide more funding to recreational sports and facilities and the other called for a committee to reconsider campus smoking policies.
During their final meeting, senators considered passing a new resolution supporting a two-year postponement of El Centro Chicano’s relocation from its current space in the United University Church to a new space in the Student Union. The senate will continue to draft and vote on resolutions in the fall to advocate for the needs of the student body.
Until then, senators said they plan to use the summer to consider issues and articulate their goals for the year. While the senate will not be drafting or passing resolutions over the summer break, Residential Senator Brandon Chang said the group will collaborate and share ideas before classes resume.
“We certainly plan to work together over summer,” Chang said. “Even now, the senators are brainstorming projects and reaching out to various other branches of USG to facilitate collaboration so that we can hit the ground running in the fall.”
Before the fall semester begins, all of USG’s members and senators reunite during the annual fall retreat. USG Vice President Ryan Park said this is the time when USG will begin brainstorming what it wants to accomplish in the upcoming year.
Park, a former Greek senator, said the newly elected senators have already shown great potential for leadership during their first few weeks in office.
“I’m very proud of how the senators dove head first into their responsibilities and have taken up the reins without a question,” Park said. “The transition has been extremely smooth and I can’t be more proud of the dynamic attitude that each and every one of them have embodied so early on.”
Park said his goals for the senate include redefining the roles of a USG senator and encouraging senators to lead other students outside of their respective residential, commuter and Greek communities.
“I want them to transcend their constituencies and reach out to the undergraduate student population at large to champion their wishes, needs and desires on campus and to help bring USG to the students and vice versa,” Park said. “At the end of the day, the senate is a tool that any student can utilize to have their voice heard by the administration.”
Residential Senator Matthew Prusak stressed the importance of collaboration among senators.
“Senate has been working really well as a group thus far,” Prusak said. “We’ve got a great mix of individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds to ensure a balanced perspective on campus issues.”
Park said that such a balance is necessary in an organization that aims to balance the needs and interests of both the student body and the administration.
“We are the mediating body of USG,” Park said. “We are here to make sure that we are presenting well-thought-out, intelligent and poignant pieces of legislation that, in theory, positively affect the entire student population.”

Long balls landed among the palm trees to no avail on Tuesday in one of the most picturesque parks in Southern California.
Going deep · Senior outfielder Greg Zebrack (above) was USC’s top performer on Tuesday in the team’s 9-5 loss to the Pepperdine Waves. He finished 2-3 with a home run and two RBIs for the game. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (16-27), coming off a tough sweep at now No. 6 Oregon State, made their last stop of an eight-game road trip in Malibu, Calif. to take on the Pepperdine Waves (22-17).
With both teams trading early home runs in Home Run Derby fashion, it appeared as though USC would out-launch the Waves to a much-needed victory. Once again, however, the Trojan bullpen could not evade an ugly big inning and USC ended its trip on a sour note with a 9-5 loss in a season sweep against Pepperdine.
The long ball couldn’t help a Trojan team that has had difficulty taking advantage of runners in scoring position. An anemic offense contributed three home runs (five runs total) in the previous series against Oregon State and USC was ultimately unable to eke out a win against the Beavers.
On Tuesday, the Trojans scored all of their runs via the home run, but this burst of offense couldn’t make up for sloppy defense.
USC entered the game aiming to split both its road trip stretch and its season series against the Waves. The Trojans took the field in Malibu with a 3-4 record over their last seven away games, and in March, they suffered a 9-4 comeback defeat against the Waves at Dedeaux Field.
A weary Trojan team wasn’t about to catch any breaks in the last game before its anticipated homecoming.
The Waves won the last game they played on Sunday, April 21, before taking a week off for final exams and graduation. Aside from an extended rest period, Pepperdine had the advantage on the mound, sending out strong Sunday starter Aaron Brown, who looked to tack on another win to his consecutive five-game streak. USC, on the other hand, matched with its midweek starter, junior Sean Silva.
The Waves jumped ahead early against Silva, putting a two-run dent in the scoreboard in the first frame. Three consecutive singles loaded the bases and the Trojans narrowly escaped a big inning by soliciting three ground balls that produced only two runs.
Senior right fielder Greg Zebrack did some early damage control and answered with a home run to left field the very next half inning. Silva, however, was unable to suppress a retaliation effort by the Waves, who matched with a home run of their own.
The Trojan offense, eager to break its drought at Oregon State, refused to be quieted for long.
In the top of the third inning, freshman Timmy Robinson singled and demonstrated some heads-up baseball, advancing to third on a wild pick-off throw. Senior second baseman Adam Landecker tied the game at three with a timely two-run home run. Zebrack would add his second home run of the game in the top of the sixth, but the one-run lead was short-lived.
In the seventh inning, Trojans let the game completely unravel. It was the Murphy’s Law of innings: anything that could go wrong did.
Sophomore Nigel Nootbaar came in as relief and quickly found himself in a bases-loaded situation. He almost escaped the jam unscathed but the Waves capitalized on sloppy defense and poor pitching by the bullpen. Nootbaar and freshman Brooks Kriske allowed Pepperdine to excel thanks to three walks, two fielding errors, a wild pitch, a passed ball, a hit batsman — and only two hits. All runs by the relievers were unearned.
To make matters worse, USC committed its third error of the game in the very next inning when Zebrack collided with Robinson in the outfield and dropped what should have been a routine fly ball.
In the end, the five-run deficit was too much to overcome, even with junior Kevin Swick’s home run in the bottom of the ninth.
USC heads home after a disappointing 3-5 road trip and amid a four-game skid. The loss is particularly hard to stomach, but the Trojans will have to forget and move on as they take on TCU on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
The Trojans on the road so there was no bottom of the ninth inning. Another collapse by the bullpen pitching
which is supposedly the area of expertise of head coach Hubbs. The usual second half of the season
deteriorating by the team with no hope for the post season staring them in the face. New coach needed for
another sport when the last pitch thrown end of May.

In 2004, when 17-year-old Adam Holland cheerfully smiled for a photograph in his art class, he had no idea that the image would later re-surface as a popular meme.
Perhaps you’ve even seen it. No, it’s not the iconic Bad Luck Brian or Scumbag Steve images that provide some giggles at the expense of another individual’s dignity.
It’s actually worse. And sickeningly offensive.
With one look at this recent meme, it’s clear that Holland’s physical features and cognitive ability are distinct from others. That’s because Adam Holland has Down syndrome.
According to ABC News, a radio station in Florida re-purposed the original photograph of Holland at the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center into one in which he clutches a sign reading “Retarded News.” This photo was used as promotion for its “Retarded News” segment, where talk jockies would discuss odd news.
After learning of the photo’s usage, Holland’s family filed a lawsuit earlier this week against Cox Media, the owner of the Tampa, Fla., radio station WHPT-FM.
Unfortunately, this is not the first time a mentally disabled person has been mocked on the Internet. A quick Google search reveals that the Internet hosts a plethora of other tasteless graphics. This demonstrates a terrible epidemic in our nation — an epidemic of insensitivity toward the entire disabled community.
This isn’t an isolated incident. It’s actually a daily occurrence. For one, people constantly pepper everything from film dialogues to daily conversations with insulting uses of the word “retarded” to mean stupid or unintelligent. Even T-shirts and bumper stickers bare various forms of the word.
The Holland family might very well lose its battle in the courts since tort liability has protected the perpetrators of similar defamatory actions in the past. The Hollands’ request of $18 million in compensatory and punitive damages might even seem unreasonable.
Yet, this hefty punishment could deter others from denigrating helpless individuals such as Adam Holland in the future.
Though the outcome of the actual case is unclear, this does not mean the Holland cause should lose in the eyes of the average American. Even if the law does not side in his favor, we ought to help him.
In fact, every individual can support Holland and stand up for the millions of others in the disabled community by eliminating the word “retard” from daily usage.
“When [it is] used as a synonym for ‘dumb’ or ‘stupid’ by people without disabilities, it only reinforces painful stereotypes of people with intellectual disabilities being less valued members of humanity,” notes The Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, a foundation created to help those with intellectual disabilities.
The first step to eradicating insensitivity toward disabled persons is to recognize the existence of these harmful words in our vernacular. Freedom of speech, after all, does not entitle any person to degrade another group of individuals.
Surely, disposing this word from common usage might seem unreasonable. To some, political correctness is a last priority when their lives are inundated by other concerns.
But this isn’t just about political correctness. This is about being human. Every time someone uses this word, it trivializes the integrity of the disabled community. To create a world accepting of people from all walks of life, this change to word choice must occur.
In the end, able-bodied people can only say so much about the use of the word “retard.”
But hearing it from someone who experiences mental disability? Now that creates an impact.
“I’m a 30-year-old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public’s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow,” wrote Special Olympics athlete John Franklin Stephens. “Being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much.”

This was great.  I’ve never seen the photo before.  Some of them are fantastic.  My favorite is, “I can count to potato”.  Classic.
Wonderful article, so pleased to see it.  It is so important for college students to be aware of this issue. “People First” language itself has controversy and a range of opinions …..mighty make an interesting article (next year since finals are coming up)!
Persons (or people) with disabilities — not disabled people: “People first.”
This issue is unarguable. I remember something my mother told me:  “You can explain and excuse misbehavior, but cruelty can never be adequately explained and is never excusable.”
Actually, Freedom Of Speech carries no “hate” or “derogatory” exception.  A Society’s commitment to Free Speech is judged not on how well we defend the rights of those making popular statements.  It’s how well (or indeed whether) we make any defense of the rights of those spewing the most vile, offensive, horrific opinions and thoughts.
“I may not agree with what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it,” is not just what some old, dead guy said a long time ago before humanity invented “sensitivity.”  It is the core of all Free Speech.
Campaigns to eradicate words from the lexicon always work so well, don’t they?  We’ve gotten rid of the “g” word, the “n” word, the OTHER “n” word, that “f” word, and oh so many “c” words from our language.  Not sure how we’re doing on the “i” word – but then, “i” people don’t know we’re talking about them, so it’s ok….
This article is absolutely stunning. Such an important cause to discuss–your tone is so genuine. You are as incredible of a person as you are a writer.

The annual White House Correspondent’s Association Dinner took place Saturday in Washington D.C. Despite the mostly lighthearted commentary of President Barack Obama’s night as comedian-in-chief, however, scathing comments by former Alaska governor Sarah Palin stood out.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
 
As celebrities and journalists walked down the red carpet, Palin used her social media accounts to express clear disapproval for the annual dinner. On Twitter, she called it “pathetic,” going on to say: “The rest of America is out there working our asses off while these DC assclowns throw themselves a #nerdprom.”
Though unsurprisingly inflammatory and subpar in their eloquence, Palin’s comments might actually have some logic to them. During a time of national paranoia following the attacks in Boston and economic struggles throughout the country, the extravagance and seeming whimsy of the WHCA dinner hardly seem necessary, let alone appropriate.
Originally formed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914, the White House Correspondents’ Association was created as a way to facilitate relations between the White House and the media. As the WHCA’s website explains, the main goal of the association is “the promotion of the interests of those reporters and correspondents assigned to cover the White House.”
Over time, however, the dinner has become a star-studded spectacle, with press associations bringing along actors and actresses all the way from Hollywood for a night of comedy. This year, Conan O’Brien hosted the event and celebrities including Gerard Butler and Sofia Vergara attended. As well-known as these stars might be, their relevance to White House press relations remains somewhat of a mystery.
Of course, maintaining openness between the government and the journalists that work for public transparency is very important in any democratic nation.
Additionally, arguments that the WHCA dinner is a waste of taxpayer dollars are essentially moot, considering that it is a privately funded event. Not to mention, one of the main outcomes of the evening is a new cache of scholarship money for up-and-coming young journalists — each year, more than $100,000 is raised for the cause, according to the WHCA.
The dinner itself is not the problem since it is, in fact, a great way to foster relations between the press and the president in addition to helping aspiring young journalists get their starts.
Unnecessary celebrity attendance is the actual problem. There is obviously nothing wrong with some joking around as a break from the political infighting of Washington and the sobering headlines in the news, but to bring in people that have arguably no relevance in the sphere of politics or political reporting distracts from the point of the evening.
The coziness between Hollywood and Washington, though entertaining, has been endlessly frustrating for many who see celebrities as opportunistic figureheads without any real political knowledge or relevance.
To claim that there is any true benefit from an intersection between the realms of entertainment and politics is to aggrandize the former’s impact on national affairs and delegitimize the latter’s seriousness.
Political advocacy by private citizens, not by the almost uniformly left-leaning stars of Hollywood, is what should be encouraged. Continuing to treat these stars as special despite what can only be called insignificance in the political sphere is a mistake and distracts from the real issues at hand.
Hollywood and its elite are undoubtedly part of what make America great, not to mention entertaining. But its influence does not belong in politics, much less press coverage of politics, and the WHCA dinner should be re-purposed to reflect this fact. Then, people like Palin can move on to make entertaining commentary on the real political issues.
 
Sarah Cueva is a junior majoring in Middle East studies and political science. Her column “Homeland” ran Wednesdays.
Ms. Cueva’s point might be worth exploring, but the article itself is riddled with logical fallacies. 
Her argument that the Hollywood media has no business in politics is unsubstantiated in her article. We are left begging the question as to why she thinks that Hollywood media is such a problem. 
“To claim that there is any true benefit from an intersection between the realms of entertainment and politics is to aggrandize the former’s impact on national affairs and delegitimize the latter’s seriousness.” Why does the entertainment business have no legitimate role in politics? Well, to claim to the contrary, according to Ms. Cueva, is simply the “delegitimize [politic]’s seriousness.” Why? Well, the article is silent. 
I personally believe that we should re-evaluate our definition of media, for surely Hollywood actors are part of the media as well–they are in the public sphere, and they comment on politics directly and through specific choices when it comes to what they produce artistically. Why should the media be strictly defined as newspaper writers and the like?
If she can demonstrate that the entertainment business is really so far removed from politics so as to make the WHCA dinner a sham, then it would have been an interesting article. But until then, the article is empty rhetoric.
Who cares what Palin thinks? The woman served half a term as governor and made an utter fool of herself running for VP. She has no expertise in anything and just says/tweets things to get attention or a rise out of people.
After an astute observation of Sarah Palins calling out the elite in their America burns while Obama and the Media fiddles, you still get in a shot at Sarah Palin in your” subpar in their eloquence” comment. Sarah Palin through that Tweet reached many folks, she speaks for the common man/woman, and blogs were buzzing for several days after, so it proves she hit the target. I commend you for paying attention and writing about it, keep it up.
Willie Heath
Ms. Cueva, 
Cluttering your otherwise exceptional writing with a pedantic phrase like “subpar in their eloquence” detracts from your point. It has become a tiresome technique, a trite device, that should anything positive be said about Sarah Palin that something negative must neutralize it. Be confident in your opinions. 
Much success,
Freempg
PS: 
You may want to Google what writing analysts determined after reviewing nearly 30,000 of Governor Palin’s emails which were released on a freedom of information request (I know you were referencing a tweet, but just in case you have an interest; and those cited below are Democrat analysts), here’s an excerpt:
“It turns out Palin’s writing skills are better than most educated Americans. Global Language Monitor gave Palin’s emails a score of 8.2, which actually exceeds that of most chief executives. “She’s very concise. She gives clear orders. Her sentences and punctuations are logical,” said Paul Payack of GLS. “She has much more of a disciplined mind than she’s given credit for.”
“John Katzman, CEO of another company, 2tor, gave Palin a score of 8.5. He said the potential presidential candidate’s emails scored higher than his own, when based on the widely-used Flesch-Kincaid readability test.
“But what do the scores actually mean? Payack offered Abraham Lincoln’s ‘Gettyburg Address’ and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech as points of comparison. They earned scores of 9.1 and 8.8, respectively.”

Michael Parks, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and former Los Angeles Times editor, will lead the Annenberg School for Journalism as interim director for the second time, Annenberg announced Tuesday.
The decision comes after Douglas Foster, a Northwestern University professor, withdrew from the director position after accepting it Friday, according to the Los Angeles Times.
This will be Parks’ second time as interim director for the school, serving in the position before in 2001 after being a part of the Annenberg faculty for a year. In March 2002, he was named director and served until June of 2008, when outgoing director Geneva Overholser was selected.
Overholser announced in November that she will step down as director of the school in June, at which point the school launched a recruitment campaign for her successor. The search for a new director will continue as Parks heads the school.
Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III said Parks’ experience will positively impact the school and its students.
“Michael Parks is a real star,” Wilson said in a statement. “His extraordinary wisdom and experience will be invaluable to our students, faculty and staff.”
Earlier in his career, Parks he reported internationally and won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his coverage of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. He served as the editor of the Los Angeles Times from 1997-2000.
Parks said he looks forward to returning to Annenberg at a time of great change. He cited the construction of the Wallis Annenberg Hall, which is slated to open in fall semester 2014.
“We have great students and a terrific faculty that is looking forward to taking full advantage of this wonderful new building and all the opportunities that it will provide in developing an even more innovative program for our students,” Parks said. “I’m proud to lead the USC Annenberg Journalism School as we move closer to this remarkable milestone.”
During Parks’ first term, he guided the creation and adoption of a new core reporting curriculum for Annenberg students in print, broadcast and new media programs. He also expanded the international reporting programs and developed the school’s focus on covering diverse communities.
 
Parks will lead the SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM, which is a sub-unit of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. He will not lead USC Annenberg — that post is still held by Dean Wilson.

The Los Angeles Fire Department responded Tuesday morning to an alert reporting heavy smoke on the university park campus, according to the Los Angeles Times.
LAFD spokesman Brian Humphrey said the firefighters were called to the fourth-floor of Vivian Hall, located on Watt Way, at approximately 9:40 a.m. The crews were able to quickly extinguish the flames in under 10 minutes.
The incident was a result of overheated equipment, according to USC Emergency Information.
There are no reported injuries.
University spokesman Carl Marziali said the Schwarzenegger Institute Immigration Forum at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, where former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arizona Senator John McCain gathered, was not affected.
The building will remain closed until further notice.
