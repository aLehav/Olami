With spring just around the corner, this weekend’s box office brings several new releases, targeting a variety of demographics. While all of these films will suffer because of the Academy Awards on Sunday, some of them should have enough draw to audiences to the theaters.
The most talked about release this weekend should be the Liam Neeson action-thriller Non-Stop.  Starring Neeson, Julianne Moore and Lupita Nyong’o, the film explores the airplane hijacking genre. Neeson plays a federal air marshal who must deal with a mystery terrorist on the flight.  As he is accused of being the terrorist and people die, the film becomes more and more tense. Ever since Taken (2009), Neeson has become a fan favorite in the action genre. His overwhelming popularity will draw large crowds, and Non-Stop may be the film that takes down The Lego Movie as the top box office hit this weekend.
Son of God is the new biblical film based on the ten-hour History Channel miniseries The Bible.  It mostly uses footage from the miniseries, as well as some deleted scenes that were not featured in the original broadcast. The series was a huge hit when it was released, by both religious and nonreligious audiences alike. The film will likely garner plenty of viewers, but should not be as popular as Non-Stop.
Stalingrad is an epic historical film with the backdrop of World War II. In one of the most important battles of the war, the film follows a band of soldiers as they fight against the German army. The Russian film has not been heavily marketed to American audiences, and most people may not have even heard of it. It does have a nationwide release but probably will not be featured in as many theaters as the previous two films. Look for it to remain relatively low compared to the other new releases.
The one interesting development for this weekend is the theatrical release of a new version of Anchorman 2. The new version, which is Rated R, is said to be 95 percent different from the version released in December, and is 20 minutes longer. The nature of the filming of Anchorman 2 relies heavily on improvisation, which means that the filmmakers had a lot of spare footage and extra jokes. These were all combined into a brand new film which still follows the same plot as the original version. This special version of the film is only going to be released in theaters for a week, but it will be available on Blu-Ray and DVD. The Anchorman franchise is beloved by its fans, so the film should get a decent amount of viewers.
Non-Stop seems like the most popular movie for this weekend.  The question still remains whether or not it can overrule The Lego Movie. Non-Stop does ride the coattails of Liam Neeson’s popularity, but The Lego Movie should dominate once again.

I have this thing for bell peppers, especially since I noticed that spring break is about three weeks away and I am nowhere near bikini shape – anyone with me.
Turkey sausage stuffed bell peppers. –Alegra Hueso | Daily Trojan
Bell peppers are my go-to if I’m craving sweets, if I need a snack, if I’m eating late, if I don’t have time to cook anything or if I feel like all the vegetables I eat just are not enough. But it’s gotten monotonous and, if you’re an omnivore, that vegetable diet gets pretty boring, so I created a bell pepper concoction to spice things up.
This recipe is perfect for dinner, lunch and even as an appetizer to impress your friends (hint, hint, the Oscars are on Sunday!).
Turkey Sausage Stuffed Bell Peppers
Serves 4 people
 1 package of Jenny-O Italian sausages (or ground turkey)
4 large bell peppers (any color you want, make it colorful!)
1 cup chopped green onion
Olive oil
1 cup of brown rice (optional)
1 cup chopped white onion
2 cloves chopped garlic
Salt and pepper, to taste
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and spray a cookie sheet with non-stick spray.
Ground Turkey
Sauté the ground turkey with the chopped white onions and chopped garlic in a pan with about a tablespoon of olive oil until the ground turkey is brown and the onions are clear – sprinkle some Italian spices, salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
Turkey sausage
If the sausage is uncooked, you can choose to bake it or slice and sauté it the same way you would the ground turkey following the same directions as above. The cooked sausage has to be sliced and added to a pan with olive oil, white onions and garlic. Sauté till cooked.
Brown Rice
This is an optional bit – it all depends on whether you want more or less fiber. In the end you are going to mix the brown rice with the meat mixture and then stuff it in the peppers.
If you do use brown rice, use a little more than two cups of water for every one cup of rice and cook until tender. When done, rinse under cold water and set aside.
Put the cooked meat in a mixing bowl, add the chopped green onion and fold together. If using brown rice, add it to the mixing bowl and fold it in as well.
Next comes the fun part: the bell peppers.
Take your bell pepper and slice off the top half – that is below the stem and about a quarter of an inch below that. Save the top, because you’ll need to place it on the stuffed bell pepper while it cooks. You’ll also need to pull out the seeds and heart of the bell pepper, so don’t be shy to pull them out with your hand and toss them. Repeat this for all of your bell peppers.
Once all of the bell peppers are clean, take a spoon and gently put the meat mix into the peppers. Repeat this step for each pepper.
When they are all filled, replace the pepper tops and put them the oven until you can see that the edge of the bell peppers look wilted, about 15 minutes.
When the bell peppers are finally done, let them stand for a few minutes to cool and then proceed to dive in for some wonderful bursts of flavor.

If you don’t speak Russian and you don’t speak German, you might want to think about taking a crash course in Rosetta Stone before watching Stalingrad out of concern that a subtitled film about an epic tale of love and war would be too much for the monolingual brain. And you would be right — but not for that reason. In fact, the meaning of Stalingrad for the people whose lives and family history it documents will never be fully understood by the casual moviegoer, and Stalingrad certainly does not attempt to facilitate that understanding. 
After a meteoric rise to the most successful contemporary Russian film of all time, Stalingrad comes to American theaters starting today to provide a glimpse into the battle that turned the tide of World War II. The film, the first in Russia to be shot with IMAX 3D technology, recounts “a dramatic love story against the backdrop of a grand battle,” an ambitiously daunting task that does little justice to the love story and systematically fails to render an account of the bloodiest battle in human history. 
This is evident from line one, as the film confusingly begins amidst the colossal relief effort following the 2011 tsunami in Japan (as if the story of one human disaster was not enough). In a hilariously contrived (yet deathly serious) scene, a Russian doctor comforts several German civilians (in Japan, remember) over a makeshift radio as they lie trapped underground. Telling them that he “had five fathers,” the doctor begins to recount the story of his Russian mother and the men that protected her during World War II. 
As the Russian army mounts a failed assault from across the Volga river, a band of Russian officers under the command of Captain Gromov (Pyotr Fyodorov) occupy a small house on the outskirts of the city. They find themselves surrounded by the German army and in the presence of Katya (Mariya Smolnikova), a Russian girl who is the only surviving member of her family, and refuses to leave her home despite it being on the front line. As the soldiers become more and more attached to Katya, she becomes their motivation to defend the building from the German army’s continued assaults. 
The German officer (Thomas Kretschmann) in charge of taking back the house is deeply distracted by his own romantic attachment to Masha (Yanina Studilina), a Russian civilian. Though the film is unabashedly pro-Russian, the great irony is that Kretschmann not only turns in the best acting performance of the cast, but also grounds the film to its most tangible takeaway. Kretschmann’s slow descent into madness as everything is slowly stripped away from him is a pleasing contrast to the hopelessly confusing love affair between the Russians that is never fully resolved. 
 “Stalingrad” will be most remembered for its shocking battle reconstructions and eye-popping visual effects. The film makes use of more than 900 extras for some scenes, and each set was meticulously reproduced in St. Petersburg over the course of six months. The sequences involving plane crashes, hand-to-hand combat and a charging brigade of flaming Russian soldiers are worth the price of admission alone, even if the rest of the film’s dramatization falls largely flat. On a related note, the musical selection and sounds are some of the best of any battle movie and accompany each and every bloody battle scene with impressive gusto. Stalingrad is an action movie that attempts to adopt a non-action-based premise, but it is the intense action that provides the real strong point of the movie. 
Stalingrad reflects Russian pride in a way that many American moviegoers will only obtain a very surface level understanding of — whether that’s the fault of the movie’s producers or American history books will remain an open question. It wants viewers to cheer for Russia, and potential moviegoers would do well to heed the films most profound line, shared with Katya by Gromov: “We will wait it all out, like we are floating on a cloud.” The film’s success depends on the ability of viewers to float on a cloud of ignorance and suspend historical context to wait out an improbable yet creatively constructed love story for the film’s 131 minute running time. If they can, given that suspending historical context is usually not difficult for American audiences, the film will bedazzle them. 
As a redeeming quality, the film is not totally blind to the human costs of war. The depiction of a gross atrocity on the part of the German army in the plaza is as traumatic and well shot as any, and the conclusion serves as a stark awakening that remedies (albeit hastily) the overriding sense of melodrama that had previously hung over the plot. For these reasons, Stalingrad isn’t a bad movie — it is a misguided one informed by a distorted reading of history and an overly complex dramatic interpretation of a love story. These qualities don’t make it less enjoyable, but they do leave a sense of lost potential.
