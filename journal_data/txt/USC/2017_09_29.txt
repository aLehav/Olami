No. 5 USC entered Friday night’s contest against No. 16 Washington State in Pullman with a perfect record, national championship aspirations and a chance at proving it was the undeniable king of the Pac-12.
It left with its first loss, its odds at the College Football Playoff shrunken considerably and its reign on the conference in question.
In front of a raucous crowd of over 33,000 at Martin Stadium that poured onto the field after the final whistle, the Trojans struggled to find their game. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, with a ravaged offensive line protecting him, was not his usual self, and a late fourth-quarter flash was not enough.
In fact, it was a mistake by Darnold, with USC down a field goal in the final minutes that ended the game. He made a weak attempt to toss the football ahead to avoid a sack, but it wound up a fumble and a recovery by Washington State.
On this night, it was Washington State’s time to shine. Tickets, even standing room only, were sold out for this game. Before kickoff, the public address announcer hyped up the crowd by boasting the game was being broadcast on national television.
And on the big stage, it was Pullman’s Cougars who bested Hollywood’s Trojans, 30-27. It snapped USC’s 13-game win streak dating back to last season, its first loss in more than a calendar year.
“We’ve got a bunch of hurt kids in that locker room right now,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It’s been a while since we’ve felt this, and it hurts.”
Redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins even became emotional.
“I cried, honestly, in the locker room,” he said. “It hurt.”
With time winding down in the fourth, the Cougars marched downfield thanks to a 35-yard run by running back Jamal Morrow. A 32-yard field goal by Erik Powell served as the eventual game-winner.

It came after Darnold, who had been struggling all night long, found a connection with redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns to tie the game. On 4th-and-13 at the 42-yard line, Darnold found the receiver in traffic for the conversion. And on the next play, he hit Vaughns against to set up first-and-goal. He finally punched in a two-yard touchdown run to even the score with five minutes left in regulation.
But he didn’t have enough in the tank for another two-minute drill a la Texas, though everyone, including Darnold himself. expected him to pull another rabbit out of his hat.
“I thought it was automatic points,” Hawkins said. “One of the best quarterbacks in the country. Whether it be 3 or 7 [points], I thought we were going to score regardless.”
The Cougars pulled ahead in the fourth quarter on a masterful drive by  Falk, who converted several third downs and a fourth down and finally found Morrow on a shovel pass for a 23-yard score to put Washington State in front 27-20.
Falk finished with 340 yards on 34-of-51 passing, outplaying Darnold, who was 15-of-29 for 164 yards. Washington State finished 8-of-18 on third downs, while USC only converted two of their 11 third-downs attempts.
“It ends up costing us a lot of plays defensively,” Helton said.
Falk was also effective in making adjustments.
“There were times when we would change something and he would change something back,” junior linebacker Cameron Smith said. “Pretty smart guy.”
The two teams traded field goals in the third quarter, with neither settling into an offensive flow. There were punts, penalties, reviews and stoppages as the game grinded to a halt and the teams entered the fourth quarter tied 20-20.
In contrast, USC’s offense looked sharp to start the game, as Darnold marched the team down on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a touchdown. It was the Trojans’ most efficient drive of the half, and it ended with a four-yard touchdown run by Darnold after he had scampered for nine yards on the previous play to set up first-and-goal.
But then the offense sputtered, and the injuries started piling up. The Trojans already came into the game banged up. USC was without redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. (groin) and redshirt junior guard Toa Lobendahn (staph infection) in addition to junior linebacker Porter Gustin (toe/bicep). Then, late in the first quarter, junior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga appeared to hurt his left leg and was replaced by freshman offensive tackle Andrew Vorhees. And senior offensive guard Viane Talamaivao appeared to hurt his shoulder early in the second quarter. USC was down to two healthy starting offensive lineman for the remainder of the game.
Injuries, though, serve as nothing but a pity call.
“Nobody’s going to have any sympathy for us,” Hawkins said. “We’re injured across the board. Nobody’s going to say anything about that.”
Darnold added that it came down to simply performing.
“We knew what they were going to do,” he said. “It was just a matter of executing at that point, and they out-executed us.”

The offensive line issues didn’t help Darnold, who couldn’t find a rhythm and threw several questionable balls and one interception in the first half. He was bailed out only by an explosive 86-yard touchdown run by junior running back Ronald Jones II that put the Trojans ahead 14-10 in the second quarter. It was the longest touchdown run by a USC running back since 1996.
Still, USC looked to have all the momentum when, on Washington State’s ensuing possession, Falk’s pass was tipped and intercepted by senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu inside the five-yard line. But Darnold and Co. could not capitalize, settling instead for a field goal and a 17-10 advantage.
It allowed the Cougars to hang around and tie the game at halftime. Falk had a strong first half, and the USC secondary allowed several big plays. Down 7-3 early in the second quarter, Falk dumped a screen pass off to wide receiver Tavares Martin Jr., who had nothing but clear space ahead of him for a 28-yard touchdown. And right before halftime, Falk led the Cougars on a 12-play, 94-yard drive that started from their own six-yard line and was aided by a few pass interference penalties by the Trojans. Morrow pounded it in from a yard out to tie the game at the half.
The Trojans are sure to slip in the rankings, and will have to win out in order to get back into the playoff conversation. But for now, the focus shifts to next week and Oregon State at home
“They’re probably not going to be happy to play us after this one,” Hawkins said.

Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry released a letter to the USC community on Friday officially instating new Greek recruitment standards, which require a minimum USC GPA of 2.5 and 12 completed units. It will be effective beginning in Fall 2018.
The new requirements, which apply to organizations in the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council, essentially restrict first-semester freshmen and new transfer students from joining Greek organizations in the fall, as they have not yet completed the necessary units with the University and do not have a GPA. The decision comes after intense debate over whether fall recruitment placed too much stress on first-year students who had to balance the recruitment process with their first week of classes at USC.
Carry said that the new standards, which the University had been discussing since this past summer, were created to allow students a semester to adjust before participating in Greek recruitment.

“This is the toughest year of the transition to college as students experience the most social and academic challenges,” the letter reads. “A number of our peer institutions have implemented policies that support first-year students by allowing them time to acclimate to the university’s academic and social climate before participating in Greek-letter organizations.”
According to the letter, Carry took many opinions and perspectives into account before reaching a final decision, including those of leaders of all USC Greek councils, individual council presidents, Undergraduate Student Government, parents, alumni and students. Carry said he also read statements from the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council, which opposed the new standards.
“In weighing these considerations, the University has concluded that the benefit of allowing new students one semester to acclimate to USC academics and social life far outweigh the benefits of not making this policy change,” Carry wrote in the letter.
Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs Monique Allard will assemble a task force to discuss how to best implement the new standards and address concerns, according to the letter. The task force, which will begin meeting in early October, will include the Greek Council, Undergraduate Student Government and the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership.
Carry recognized the importance of Greek organizations and their various contributions to student life, such as providing a community of brotherhood and sisterhood, academic support and philanthropy.
“Fraternities and sororities are an integral part of the campus community and can have a positive impact for members and non-members,” Carry wrote. “These organizations have been an instrumental part of the USC experience dating back to 1889. We believe it is important for us to have a healthy and thriving Greek community as part of our student-life experience.”
In response to Carry’s letter, Panhellenic Council President Jamie Kwong said in an email to the Daily Trojan: “The Panhellenic Council is ready to work closely and openly with the administration to ensure the implementation of the change in eligibility does not detrimentally affect the well-being of our active members, new members, potential new members, or chapters.”
IFC leadership released a letter Friday opposing the administration’s decision, and presenting a three-fold proposal for addressing the new recruitment standards including a public meeting with administrators and non-binding mediation. “Unilaterally implementing policy that limits a first-year student’s freedom of association with no meaningful input from student leaders is contrary to everything this university stands for,” the letter said.
The Interfraternity Council did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.
EDITOR’S NOTE: this post has been updated to reflect the Interfraternity Council’s letter responding to the University’s decision.
greek people mad but helpless now. Let them rage. Nice move, USC. XDD
Only JESUS saves!
I’m here to tell you USC has been misleading and lying about nearly everything for the last two years involving the Greek system and I have seen it first hand.   While a Dean smokes crack with prostitutes in Pasadena and a coach takes envelopes full of cash in a Vegas hotel room, members of the Greek community have raised countless dollars for charities across this great nation and especially right here in Los Angeles.  The Greek system is what is right about SC and not the source of any real issues for which this misguided and ill conceived policy claims it will address.
SC Greeks have for many decades and continue to this day to have among the highest grades and graduation rates of all students University wide.  SC knows this information all too well.    I’m sure if they made a category for you Greek haters, you people would have among the lowest grades and graduations rates.   A quick Google search indicates Greeks are not only more successful in college, they are more successful after and make more money over their lifetime and as a group they are more generous to the educational institutions that share their ideals.    You Greek haters are generally known for breaking Starbucks windows after your barista shift is over.
I have news for SC and all you Greek haters out there.   It’s probably time to drag SC into court and have this policy and the false and misleading data used to justify it reviewed by a Judge.   You don’t take away a select group of peoples’ rights without consequences.   Fight On and Fight Greek Discrimination!
To be fair, why is the deferment just focused on the Greek system?
Isn’t finding your way as a Freshman or new transfer student part of the
 experience regardless of the path one chooses?  Sure it’s stressful.
Some doors will close.  And others will open.  Should our athletic
teams, newspaper, clubs and marching band not recruit new students in
the Fall too?  Are the mental health issues somehow confined to just
those seeking a Greek experience?
Ainsley Carry is on a mission to dismantle Greek life…..  his words are disingenuous.  The new policy will create serious financial difficulties for many houses — and he is fully aware of that.  Any houses that survive will be limited in membership to wealthy pledges who can afford the higher expenses.
Thanks AC Ron for spoiling the party and relieving yourself on the Constitution people far greater than you fought and died for.  You apparently know better about what organizations others should be allowed to join and when.  Let me guess, it’s okay to join ANTI-FA and break windows as a first semester freshman?  
Lastly, when I need an Uber at the airport, I’ll be sure and ask for Ron in the little black Prius.
???
Clearly our Uber driving friend Ron is nothing but a silly SJW who needs
 to consider hair plugs or one of those Che beret for his photo.
Toxic subculture?  You are obviously one of those Greek haters BigDawgSigC is talking about.

Nice account.
This is America and we have a constitutional right to associate with anyone we like.  Membership in a Greek organization is a form of association protected under the constitution and this will not stand the legal test that is coming.   Time to bring in the lawyers to teach Mr. Carry about our fundamental rights as Americans.
You have the constitutional right to associate with whomever you like but Greek organizations are governed by the rules of the university and have to abide by those rules. This kind of requirement is actually not even unusual – there are plenty of other schools that have this sort of requirement. As a USC alumnus, I wholeheartedly support this new regulation.
Great.  Then, to be fair, let’s apply this new regulation to our athletic teams, newspaper, clubs and marching band which are also governed by the rules of the university.  Or are these the privileged students to whom rules and fairness do not apply?
Do these organizations have a history of being associated with a toxic subculture? If so then yes, I support the same standard being applied for them.
Good point, though Dr. Carry did not label Greek organizations as a “toxic subculture.”  On the contrary, he referenced them as “an instrumental part of the USC experience dating back to 1889.”   Binge drinking is toxic however and its prevalence across all University organizations Greek and non-Greek should be explored.  Deferring first semester Greek rush is not the answer to this epidemic.  If such a simple solution was the answer then surely Dr. Carry would want all University organizations to defer first semester recruitment.
I was referring more specifically to a toxic history of sexual assault.
Another good point and an extremely important issue, but one that is not isolated to the Greek community.  Further, how does a first semester recruitment deferment solve this issue?
It’s a private university, so they don’t have to follow those rules. Unfortunately, there is no standing here.

Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that he was absolutely, unequivocally not running for president. And for the sake of this country, I sincerely hope he’s telling the truth. 
Aside from the general distaste of all things Silicon Valley left over from my few years living in the East Bay, what concerns me most about a Zuckerberg presidential run is not just his total lack of qualifications — it is the ease with which I can imagine him garnering significant portions of the millennial vote. 
I worry about how many write-in presidential votes there really were for Harambe, and all of our other generational garbage. If Zuckerberg really were to run, his target would probably be voters under 35, and his slant, far-left. Imagine this: a young, dopey Sen. Bernie Sanders without the 30 years of congressional experience, but all the fanfare of the American college campus. In an era in which a reality TV star just became the president of the United States, I fear that if we start giving unintentional, subconscious credence to these poor political jokes we resurrect again and again (the Rock 2020, for instance), we will grow into a generation that thinks it is permissible for deeply underqualified, apolitical figures to be president simply because they are famous. This phenomenon coupled with the recent anti-establishment sentiment among the young, naive and uneducated could hammer a deep nail into the coffin of our tangible political future. 
College students, and young people in general, really do need to get a little bit more elitist about who they choose to support. There’s a difference between “establishment” and “qualified” — and we need to start paying much more attention to the latter, rather than simply waiting to judge whether we think they’re old and boring or not. Of course, “old and boring” is how a spry and charming Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush; it is also how John F. Kennedy framed Richard Nixon, borrowing Kim Jong Un’s wonderful word, as a dotard. But there is a difference between a young governor or senator, and a shrewd media mogul who goes to work in beat-up flip flops. But if you slept through your high school civics course and the Bernie 2016 parade gave you the notion that our national political woes can be summed up with a shrill whine of “Establishment!”, then sure: Elect our first Flip Flop President.
For a generation with so much on the line (job prospects, student debt, health care), we are remarkably out of tune with the more distasteful political realities. If you are expecting the feel-good honorific politics of Jackie, look elsewhere. Learning to participate in our national political system is also about learning how to accept pragmatism, argue forcefully and elect leaders who have the sufficient background to run the country — not the candidate who makes you feel good about them. 
David Brooks recently wrote in The New York Times that Donald Trump was elected as a “cultural” president, not as an instrument of governance. Thank you, David, for the breakthrough realization that Trump was elected on valence and intangible aspects of leadership. The problem with that narrative is that Trump, cultural president or not, had to turn around on Jan. 20 and be a real president — one that takes security briefings, one that reads, reviews and monitors legislation, one that appoints capable cabinet members and federal officials, one that pays attention to the everyday needs of all Americans and one who attends to the fallout of natural disasters. He has done none of these things; it seems his only “cultural” breakthrough was reinviting Nazism into modern political discourse. 
Make no mistake — liberals and progressives can elect a Trump, too, but one that caters to our “cultural” agenda instead of that of the right. As the time comes that future presidential  hopefuls will begin softly fundraising and working, and whisperings emerge, remember: As we have learned from the Trump administration, competence and experience are key. Let’s not make this mistake twice, and especially not for a liberal businessman equally as flashy and just as unprepared.

Of the Daily Trojan opinion pieces that I have read, I only hear the liberal narrative. I appreciate and respect all voices, and yes, these are opinions which are 100% subjective, however, it would be nice to hear some diversity in opinions when it comes to today’s political landscape.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Seven years after both USC’s basketball and football teams suffered crippling sanctions for players on both teams receiving improper benefits, the athletic program finds itself in the same situation — except under much more damning circumstances.
Tuesday’s news that four college basketball assistant coaches — including the Trojans’ associate men’s basketball coach Tony Bland — were arrested as part of an FBI sting on charges that include conspiracy to commit bribery and wire fraud rocked the college basketball world. But for USC, it was just another athletics scandal.
We all remember where we were when the football team was docked scholarships, given probation, a two-year bowl suspension and forced to forfeit the 2004 national championship over Reggie Bush and his family receiving gifts. It was among the harshest penalties handed down in NCAA history, and the fact that a prominent program like USC was on the receiving end sent shockwaves through college sports.
That same year, the basketball team self-imposed sanctions after O.J. Mayo also took cash and gifts while in school, forfeiting the entire 2007-2008 season, cutting down scholarships and forgoing postseason play for a year. 
This time, though, it wasn’t just an outsider paying or gifting athletes as was the case back in 2010 — it was an assistant coach allegedly funneling money directly to current players and guiding them to certain agents. Not only are these egregious federal and NCAA violations, but they also put into question the morality of the basketball program as a whole — whether head coach Andy Enfield knew about Bland’s actions and which players on the active roster could have been bribed.
According to court documents made public on Tuesday, Bland took $13,000 in cash in exchange for promising a sports agent that he would direct certain players to hire him. He also allegedly facilitated $9,000 to the families of two USC players — an incoming freshman and a rising sophomore.
In contrast to its slow response to the scandal involving former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito, the University took action almost immediately on Tuesday. Within hours of the news breaking, Athletic Director Lynn Swann released a statement pledging to cooperate fully with the investigation. Shortly thereafter, Vice President of Athletic Compliance Michael Blanton put out a statement that said Bland had been placed on administrative leave and that USC had hired former FBI director Louis Freeh to conduct an internal investigation.
USC deserves credit for its quick response to the controversy, for immediately placing Bland on leave and for hiring a person of Freeh’s stature to investigate itself. But the University must do more, including self-imposing sanctions as it did in 2010.
By hiring Freeh, USC is showing that it takes both the allegations and their consequences seriously. In addition to his post at the FBI, Freeh conducted Penn State’s internal investigation of the Jerry Sandusky scandal in 2012 and released a scathing report claiming the school and its leaders demonstrated a “total disregard for the safety and welfare” of the children who Sandusky, a former assistant coach of the football team, abused. It was so harsh that he was sued by ex-president Graham Spanier, a lawsuit that was eventually dismissed.
Whether Freeh’s report was too critical or unfair is up for debate, but the University hiring him a mere couple of hours after the news broke indicates that USC is not simply looking for an easy way out, but rather is willing to put up with a potential Penn State-like report, one that would not at all paint the school in a positive light.
And when Swann spoke at a class on campus on Wednesday, he made clear that he is willing to be proactive.
“Where there’s smoke, there’s fire and I will act when I smell smoke,” Swann said. “I’m not interested in waiting until there’s a fire. Had we had any indication that something was wrong in any of our departments, we would have taken action sooner.”
All of this is good to hear, especially from a university that is no stranger to scandal, sports or otherwise. But the road is far from over, and USC has a ways to go before it is free of this controversy. First, Swann must decide Enfield’s future. In the past, programs could put all the blame on assistant coaches in the case that an assistant went rogue. But in 2013, an NCAA rule stipulated that head coaches may be suspended for violations committed by assistant coaches. Louisville head coach Rick Pitino, whose school was also implicated in the scandal, already lost his job, and if Enfield is found to have had knowledge of Bland’s actions beforehand, he could, too, be in hot water.
Additionally, like in 2010, USC must also decide whether it wants to self-impose sanctions and hope the NCAA accepts them without piling on more. It did in 2010, but these circumstances are different, given how egregious Bland’s violations were. There’s no way of knowing how many penalties the program will have slap on itself in order to appease the NCAA, but it has to do more than what it imposed seven years ago. And entering a season in which the team is ranked top-15 in most preseason polls, Swann and Co. have to decide whether to compromise what could be the basketball program’s best season in decades and a potential shot at a national championship just to make the NCAA happy.
Then again, the NCAA could punish USC on its own, and retroactively strip the team of all its wins this upcoming season anyway. Like it has done thus far, the University should continue to be proactive, take responsibility for the scandal and self-impose punishments. It’s a hard call to make, but it’s the right one amidst yet another controversy to hit Heritage Hall.

When redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold and the USC offense ran onto the field trailing Texas 17-14 in the fourth quarter, it was just business as usual. While other teams would have been nervous heading onto the field down three with 39 seconds to go, the Trojans had no fear. Instead USC marched down the field to set up a game-tying field goal. Despite two overtimes, the team added another to their collection of comeback wins. 
“Thirty-nine seconds is an eternity for us,” quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator Tyson Helton said. “We don’t necessarily worry about the time, we just worry about the plays we’re going to run and when we’re going to run them.” 
Ever since the Rose Bowl and throughout the 2017 season, the team has displayed an incredible ability to remain focused and execute in close games. In fact, the offense has thrived in these moments. USC came back from 15 points in a Rose Bowl for the ages. They trailed Western Michigan by a touchdown in their home opener. Against Texas, they forced overtime with a field goal and successfully fought off what could have been the upset of the year. 
USC’s turnaround from opening up 1-3 to closing out the season with nine straight wins has been well-documented. Since he took over the starting job last season against Utah, Darnold has been the glue that has held the offense together. Darnold’s ability to spread the ball around to various offensive weapons and his ability to extend plays is a unique asset very few other teams have. His skill set has been vital to the Trojans’ turnaround, but his temperament and leadership are what gives the Trojans the confidence to comeback from any deficit.
These intangibles are what sets Darnold apart. It’s the reason why Vegas viewed him as the Heisman favorite and why he’s viewed as one of the best prospects eligible for the 2018 NFL Draft. Darnold’s philosophy is simple. 
“Keep your head down, put the blinders on,” the star quarterback said. “As long as we just do our job on every single play, it’s going to be hard to stop us.” 
Darnold’s temperament is what sets the tone in the huddle and helps make USC think it can keep up with anyone. 
“It starts with Sam,” junior tight end Tyler Petite said. “The guy’s totally composed, it doesn’t matter if there’s 39 seconds left in the game or it’s after that 4th-and-goal. He comes in and it’s just, ‘Hey let’s go score a touchdown.’ Just being able to have a guy that comes in with the same composure every single time is really calming to everyone.” 
The Trojans rely on preparation to get through adversity. Sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett credits the Trojans’ preparation as what allows them to stay calm and trust each other, and the sentiment is echoed by Darnold.
“I always go back to how we train in the offseason and how resilient our guys are on offense, defense and special teams,” Darnold said. “We’re never going to give up. We have a bunch of players that we’re confident in to make plays when the time’s needed. We know that if we’re within a touchdown or two, or even three sometimes like the Rose Bowl, we’re able to come back. We have an explosive offense and a defense that can force three-and-outs whenever they need to. It’s a matter of getting our breaks when we get them and taking advantage of them.” 
In the most pressure filled situations, Darnold doesn’t deviate from his tendency to spread the ball around.
“We have really good players and they’ve stepped up to the plate,” Tyson Helton said. 
A big part of this execution when the team needs it most comes down to trust.
“He’s trusting the coaches, the technique, our practice so that when he throws that ball that the guys going to be right there to catch it,” Petite said. “That’s what makes Sam so great, is that he trusts everybody.” 
While Darnold turned in a remarkable 2016 season, he feels he’s in a much better spot this year due to the improvement in his leadership. With many upperclassmen either going to the NFL or graduating, the Trojans came into spring camp with an emphasis on finding new leaders. True to his nature, Darnold stepped up to the challenge. 
“I’ve been more vocal,” Darnold said.“I’m still trying to lead by example but I’m definitely more comfortable talking to the guys. Last year, when we had a bunch of seniors who were here four years prior to me, I was super nervous trying to talk to them all at once. Now that I’m in my third year, here it’s easier to talk to everyone.” 
Darnold’s confidence on the field and off has set the tone for this season and has become a part of the team’s identity. Asked if there was a deficit that scared him, Darnold answered, “Maybe 50 points at halftime.” With Heisman hype and championship aspirations in the background, No. 14 will keep his blinders on and just keep doing what he does best.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
I feel like I’ve been writing the same column for the last five weeks. If anyone actually has a bead on this USC team, I’m all ears.
It’s crazy: the fifth-ranked Trojans are undefeated through their first four games of the season, meaning their playoff aspirations remain very much alive — and they have beaten so-called “rival” teams in three of those matchups, taking care of business against Stanford, Texas and Cal in consecutive weeks. Yet, it’s hard to shake the feeling that something has been missing so far this fall. USC fans may still be dreaming big for the postseason, but you can bet they’re relieved that the playoffs are months away — if the Trojans even make it there.
There is plenty to get excited about when watching this year’s team play. Junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett has established himself as a true top option following the departure of JuJu Smith-Schuster, freshman running back Stephen Carr has brought an unexpected nitro boost to the Trojans’ backfield and sophomore cornerback Jack Jones has three interceptions in his last two games.
And how about defensive end Christian Rector? After totaling four tackles across 12 games last season, the redshirt sophomore has gone off for two forced fumbles, one recovery, 3.5 sacks and 4.5 tackles for a loss so far this season. Thanks to numerous emerging threats, the Trojan defense has become a force to be reckoned with, and explosive plays have become a possibility on any snap on offense.
Then again, so have turnovers. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold has thrown seven interceptions this year, and though some have not been his fault, the total is third highest in the FBS. Add in a lost fumble from Carr last week, and USC is tied for 97th nationally in ball security with eight total giveaways.
Thanks to their ball-hawking defense, the Trojans still own a positive turnover margin (+3), and they rank top 20 in the FBS in both first downs and third-down conversion percentage, meaning they do move the ball on offense. Nevertheless, they also entered the fourth quarter tied against Western Michigan and Cal, and they needed overtime to beat Texas. It seems like the team isn’t struggling offensively as much as it is struggling to make timely plays, especially early in the game. USC was able to scrape by in its opening four games, but continuing the trend will likely prove costly tonight.

For better or for worse, undefeated No. 16 Washington State will be the litmus test for this Trojans squad. The short week is a real concern for a banged-up roster, and it means the defense might not be fresh enough to bail USC out with turnovers, especially facing the Cougars’ superstar quarterback Luke Falk. Falk is the best signal-caller the Trojans have faced all season by a significant margin, spearheading a Washington State passing attack that ranks fifth in the country.
The onus, then, will be on Darnold to prove that he is indeed the best quarterback in the nation. He may have to prevail in an old-fashioned shootout; fortunately, it’s exactly the type of game the gunslinger loves to play. Outperforming Falk and overpowering the Cougars’ defense would undoubtedly be a massive boost to Trojan fans and Darnold alike, and a win tonight may even begin carving an unlikely path back into the Heisman Trophy race.
But as has been the case all year, it’s almost impossible to predict how things will play out in Pullman. I can imagine almost anything: an impressive road victory a la the Trojans’ trip to Washington last season, to a shocking blowout loss in a packed, raucous and cold Martin Stadium. Win, and USC continues to survive and advance — optics be damned. Given how unimpressed AP Poll voters have seemed by the Trojans so far this fall, however (USC has dropped one spot from its preseason No. 4 ranking despite remaining perfect), a loss could be disastrous, especially against the team’s highest-ranked opponent of the year.
So — and I’ve definitely said this before — this week marks a turning point for head coach Clay Helton and his squad. The Trojans will aim to put all doubts to rest with a road win against a strong opponent, and the Cougars look to keep their season on the rise while killing USC’s. Let’s see which team seizes the moment and establishes its playoff credentials.
This isn’t a trap game; it’s a legitimate clash of Pac-12 titans. Brace yourselves.

Brennen Lopez | Daily Trojan
The No. 7 women’s soccer team hosted Oregon State yesterday afternoon in their first Pac-12 home game of the year, putting in an outstanding performance and defeating the Beavers 4-0.
The Trojans (6-1-1) started the game with immediate pressure on the Beaver defense, controlling the ball and possession in the opening minutes of the game.  The first chance of the game resulted from a deflection off a Beaver defender in the second minute.  The breakthrough came in the third minute when junior forward Leah Pruitt opened the scoring for the Trojans.  The ball deflected off multiple Beavers defenders inside the penalty box, and it fell kindly to Pruitt’s foot, where she slotted it into the bottom right corner to give the Trojans an early lead.
The Trojans had another golden opportunity in the sixth minute, with a cross entering from the right wing into the penalty area, but no one could get a foot on it.  The early pressure from the Trojans frustrated the Beavers, not knowing how to counter the relentlessness of the Trojan attack.  The next chance for the Trojans came in the 13th minute with a low cross from the right wing entering the penalty box to the right foot of Pruitt.  Pruitt had space inside the penalty area but only managed a shot over the crossbar. 
The chances kept coming for the Trojans such as in the 16th minute when a shot from freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo was deflected off the leg of a Beaver defender, going out of play for a corner kick.  Another chance came in the 17th minute as Pruitt was one-on-one with the goalkeeper, having beat her defender.  However, she was brought down inside the penalty box, with the referee deciding not to call a penalty.  
A second goal came in the 20th minute off a corner kick from the left side.  The ball flew in the air into the penalty box and an excellent headed effort by senior midfielder Nicole Molen doubled the lead for the Trojans.  A third goal almost came a minute later when the Trojans, once again utilizing the right flank, had a shot roll only inches wide of the right post.
The first half continued in this fashion, with an injury to an Oregon State player halting the game in the 27th minute in a somber moment for both teams.  At the end of the first half, the Trojans were dominating the game, controlling possession and maintained their 2-0 lead.                  
The Trojans started the second half just as they started the first, retaining possession and creating scoring opportunities.  A prime opportunity arose in the 48th minute with a cross from the left wing was hit with a little too much pace, not allowing redshirt senior midfielder Samantha Rooney to get a head to it.  Another opportunity came in the 50th minute with a Nicole Molen header going above the crossbar.  The Trojans continued to apply massive amounts of pressure on the Beaver backline, with opportunities arising constantly. 
The Beaver backline finally gave in the 68th minute when a shot by redshirt junior midfielder Sydney Myers, with the assistance of the goalpost, found the back of the net, extending the Trojan lead to 3-0.  Pruitt marked the perfect ending to her afternoon with another goal in the 87th minute, with a low shot beating the Beaver goalkeeper in the left, bottom corner to make the final score 4-0.
Overall, it was a very strong and dominating performance for the Trojans, leaving the game with 26 shots (15 on target) while only conceding 2 shots (0 on target).  It was a complete performance from both the Trojans attack and defense, making it impossible for Oregon State to get into a rhythm and provide a fight.  
The Trojans will host Oregon on Sunday, hoping for another win to keep their undefeated Pac-12 season alive.

Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
With the first-ever full scholarship for women’s soccer endowed recently by USC alumnus Will Ferrell and his wife Viveca Paulin, USC Athletics is moving closer to its $283 million dollar Heritage Initiative goal. 
Established in 2012, the program is part of a greater USC fundraising campaign, and includes recent developments like the renovation of Heritage Hall and the construction of the John McKay Center.
Growing endowments continue to be a large part of the department’s goal. Currently, USC Athletics has raised $197 million from endowments like Ferrell and Paulin’s. These strictly cover tuition, room and board for the 283 full scholarships the University gives to its student athletes.
“The collective cost of tuition, room and board, that we provide every year to the University for our scholarships is anywhere between $19 [million] and $20 million,” associate athletic director Alexandra Bitterlin said. “And that number obviously keeps growing as tuition rises. So what these endowments do is offset that annual money that we have to raise to meet those financial goals.”
People often don’t realize, Bitterlin said, that the athletic department is completely self-sustaining, as it receives no government funds, student fees or payments from the University. Corporate sponsorships, ticket sales and endowments allow the department to provide scholarships to its athletes.
“These donations and these donors are critical to our success,” Bitterlin said. “If we can’t pay those bills, then we’re in trouble, but luckily we’ve had some very generous donors and members of the Trojan Family who have stepped up to help.”
With the establishment of the Viveca Paulin and Will Ferrell Scholarship Fund, one of the 14 scholarships allotted for the women’s soccer team will be consistently funded, year after year. The money will start being used in 2018, although the program hasn’t decided whether the scholarship will recognize a specific recipient or simply be added to the general scholarship fund.
For head women’s soccer coach Keidane McAlpine, Ferrell and Paulin’s endowment marked an important step for women’s athletics. Since the 1970s, donors have named endowments for positions on USC’s football team; currently, all 85 positions and the head coaching spot are endowed. However, that reach doesn’t always stretch over to the women’s side, even with a NCAA championship team like McAlpine’s. 
“Let’s be honest. You get 90,000 people for a football game — our biggest crowd is 10,000 — and that’s a huge crowd, but that’s a one-time event,” McAlpine said. “We’ve gotten a great following and people reaching out, especially after last year, but [the scholarship] just gives a few other groups of people that may not be as tempted to the women’s side a window in, and that’s what’s important.”
McAlpine said the most exciting part of the scholarship news was the fact that people like Ferrell and Paulin were willing to offer their support. Although he didn’t expect the story to garner the attention it has, any buzz helps in the midst of recruiting season. For his athletes, the news also provided a morale boost.
“[It’s exciting] that somebody noteworthy and known for supporting the football team, from a USC standpoint, has taken the time to invest in what they’re doing and their work,” McAlpine said.
McAlpine, whose love of soccer stems from his days as a collegiate and professional player, is hopeful that recognition like this will help grow women’s soccer across the nation. He noted that the Ferrell family members are now owners in the Los Angeles Football Club. In addition, Paulin herself was a soccer player at Pomona College.
“The exciting part is, as we try to grow the women’s professional side, you’ve got people that are starting to back it, starting to back the game, and as you’ve seen the growth of the MLS [Major League Soccer] we’re hoping the NWSL [National Women’s Soccer League] will grow,” McAlpine said. “And this [scholarship] is just one of those, for me, a benchmark moment in that we’re finding support, moving in that general direction, and that’s very, very exciting.”

For some teenagers, it’s a familiar scene: Your friend is playing with a knife, teasing you and your other friends jokingly, putting everyone on edge but simultaneously making them laugh. Hopefully, nothing happens but you can’t help wondering to yourself, what if something did? What if someone got hurt? 
Super Dark Times , directed by USC School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Kevin Phillips, takes this all-too-common fear and turns it into a cinematic nightmare: a fully fleshed-out, worst case scenario played out on the big screen. 
The film, which was released on Sept. 29, follows a group of teenage boys in the 1990s whose carelessness ends in tragedy. This tragedy, however, is not the end of the story — it’s only the beginning. The plot of Super Dark Times takes viewers down a rabbit hole of paranoia, anxiety and insanity, with an uncanny attention to detail. 
As a teenager myself, I cannot recall a horror or thriller film that has made me feel as uncomfortable as Super Dark Times; the film’s premise and execution feel all too plausible and real. Despite drifting between startling realism and hallucinatory madness, the film feels organic. 
In one scene, a main character drinks too much medicine before bed, only to dream about his dead friend sitting on top of him, then later wakes up with an incredible pain in his stomach. The film does an absolutely stellar job portraying the guilt, grief and paranoia that haunts these boys after their friend is killed. 
Charlie Tahan, who plays one of the film’s main characters, steals the show with a thoroughly unsettling performance. He managed to seamlessly portray both teenage innocence and unsettling creepiness, at times teetering between awkwardness and full-on derangement. He’s the kid in school who has always been a little off but no one gave much thought to — no one could have predicted the capacity for evil within him. 
If there is one criticism that can be made about the film, it’s the reasoning behind it. The film doesn’t seem to convey a true message, but rather comes across more as an intense fever dream of anxiety and violence. Despite its shortcoming, the film is never less than gripping throughout.
Super Dark Times is Phillips’ first feature-length film, making the masterful direction and cinematography all the more impressive. The film is filled with beautiful shots that are artful yet non-invasive and nostalgic yet haunting. Phillips is able to capture the mood of the story and the atmosphere of the town in such a way that lends another level of authenticity to the film. Composer Ben Frost’s score is anxious and chilling — a perfect complement to the tension that continuously builds as the plot begins to unravel. 
Supported by a strong cast of young actors and actresses, and helmed by a gifted director with a clear creative vision for the story, Super Dark Times is an impressively authentic thriller film.

In June of this year, pop star and entrepreneur Rihanna revealed the new slogan for her Fenty Beauty Line: “The New Generation of Beauty.” It is to be a new generation, one that champions individuality and inclusivity, one that defies the mainstream, all while simultaneously redefining it.  It is everything Rihanna stands for, embodying the defining characteristics that have made her a generational icon, and now she is pushing others to do the same. She has already conquered the music and fashion industries but now, with Fenty Beauty, she has placed herself at the forefront of the beauty industry.
Speculation about the Fenty Beauty release date first began in April, when she made a surprise appearance at her own Fenty x Puma release, wearing a holographic lip gloss whose brand no one could identify. This was the first time she was seen wearing her own cosmetic line, and the first time the public was given a peek as to what it could possibly include. The suspicion ended with the release of two highly praised Instagram trailers featuring models Duckie Thot, Slick Woods, Halima Aden, Paloma Elsesser, Leomie Anderson, Selah Marley and more. In the first video, the models strut the streets of New York City, wearing a Fenty Beauty lip gloss and sparkly gold highlighters. In the second video, model Camila Costa lists off what appear to be shade names, including Trophy Wife, Yacht Life, Confetti and Chili Mango.
But most importantly, what has separated Fenty Beauty from the release of other celebrity makeup lines is its accessibility and benefits for diverse people. One of the most praised aspects of the beauty line is how it features 40 different foundation shades. As Rihanna told Refinery 29, she wanted “things [she] could fall in love with. Then [she] wanted things girls of all skin tones could fall in love with.”
Rihanna made sure that her line would not only feature foundations that would finally include darker skinned girls in the makeup conversation, and also carry shades for those with fairer skin, who also have trouble finding the perfect match. The line also includes six pressed powder highlights, 10 shimmer sticks and 20 creme sticks. In addition, some of the collection is geometrically designed, and many of the items magnetically connect to create what looks like DNA strands. The line is also free of sulfates, parabens and phthalates, and is cruelty-free.
Rihanna has been consciously inclusive in every decision pertaining to both her fashion and beauty lines. Specifically, in terms of Fenty Beauty, this is evident in the diverse array of products and models chosen to represent her work, as well as among the makeup artists who would represent the brand. Each makeup artist was found through open casting calls. Erik Soto, the global artistry and education senior manager for Kendo Brands — Fenty Beauty’s parent company — wrote that the purpose of open casting calls was “to build a diverse team of beauty experts who excel in the areas of artistry, elevated education, makeup experience, and have an ability to best represent the brand.” He also stated this type of interview process “levels the playing field and allows artists everywhere an opportunity and have their work seen and be considered for a global position for a dynamic new brand.”
Rihanna is truly on a quest to find the new generation of beauty. Now, all the world has to do is join her.

Last week was a seriously bizarre time for me.
I went on my first ever Tinder date (it did not go well); cycled through a weekend-long existential crisis when I thought an ex-boyfriend had begun dating someone else (I was wrong); and most shocking of all, I learned reality star/makeup mogul Kylie Jenner is allegedly four months pregnant (I’m sure you can guess how I spent my Friday night — that’s right: poring through internet theories about the pregnancy).
It was — I repeat — a seriously bizarre time, and I went to bed on Sunday night fixated on three questions: Why have I not yet met that special someone? When, if ever, am I finally going to have children? Why am I so behind in life?
Kylie Jenner is nine months older than me, a multi-millionaire, and, if the rumors are true, about to become a mother. Meanwhile, I’m nigh on 19-and-a-half, and what am I doing? Accidentally sleeping through half of my classes, on the verge of completing my ninth rewatch of The Office and spending my weeknights hunched over the editorial desk in the Daily Trojan office — that’s what. I’m not an unhappy person by any stretch of the imagination, but my life right now just isn’t what I’d always pictured for myself.
I know that that’s perfectly OK. I know that just about every millennial woman is essentially in the same boat as I am, one way or another, and any college-aged woman whose life is exactly where she planned for it to be is not only an outlier, but also probably an alien. But seeing things logically doesn’t always have the power to comfort us emotionally, and that, too, is OK.
I’m a strong believer that fourth-wave feminism — or whichever wave it is we’re on — is the construct of three central components: acceptance, honesty and the celebration of diversity. Throughout the majority of history, women were required to be a monolithic group: Marry young, have kids immediately, stay at home and do chores. I strongly doubt any American woman in the 1950s whose life trajectory had, in all likelihood, been forced upon her, would look to me — a young woman pursuing higher education, on the brink of a self-determined professional career — and feel anything but envy.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
In no uncertain terms, the fact that so many of us are doing so many different things, at so many different ages, in so many different places, is a victory for feminism.
That’s not to say that if a woman has any problems with the current state of her life, that she ought to suck it up and be grateful that she isn’t trapped within the confines of 1950s America. I know I’m blessed with privileges, opportunities and decision-making power that every one of my ancestors as well as American women throughout history would only have been able to dream of. But every now and then, between those oh-so-delightful Saturday morning “walks of shame” and nights falling asleep alone watching Netflix, I feel a twisted hollowness and regret wondering if I’ll ever have those things — a devoted husband, my own small litter of children, a cozy, nuclear family — that were forced on the generations of women who came before me.
Of course, these aren’t things all women want. To quote Parks and Recreation’s Leslie Knope, “If you want to bake a pie, that’s great. If you want to have a career, that’s great, too.”
We’re living through a period of “get yours” feminism, which is exactly what it sounds like — a time for women of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds to do what they want with their lives and bodies, and support other women doing what they want with their lives and bodies.
And to me, that’s where the honesty component comes in. It’s OK to question your direction in life, to have doubts and insecurities and to give voice to them. It’s OK to be frustrated and get angry and express yourself, and it’s OK to be frustrated and angry at things that you rationally know are ridiculous. Contrary to what most celebrity Instagram accounts would have you believe, women are human beings who go through real human experiences and feel real human emotions. Part of feminism is weathering the highs and the lows, and knowing that you’re welcome to talk about them. You can fully embrace all the tenets of feminism, and still sometimes feel bogged down and unempowered by everyday life. The movement is about being human, and being human is a universal, endless struggle.
At any rate, I guess this is just my convoluted way of saying that there’s no such thing as normal anymore. The pressures to  have this or be that at this particular time might still exist, and all the more so with the prevalence of social media. But no matter how many experiences we might share as women, we’re all going down our own paths at our own paces. Kylie Jenner will (or won’t) have her baby, and I’ll (try to) go to my 8 a.m. classes. Come November, Taylor Swift will drop a revenge album that may or may not shatter civilized society as we know it, and I’ll hunker down to finish re-watching The Office for the ninth time.
As millennial women, our freedom will sometimes be a source of heartache and struggle, just as it will sometimes be a source of triumph. All we can really do is be ourselves, see where that takes us and support our fellow femmes along the way.

Breitbart News senior-editor-at-large Joel Pollak spoke on campus Thursday at an event held by Turning Point USA at USC, a national organization for young conservatives. Pollak spoke to a group of about 15 students about topics ranging from his own experiences with politics in college, to recent political controversies like NFL players kneeling during the national anthem at football games.
A relatively new group formed on campus in early 2016, Turning Point USA also welcomed Pollak on campus in March 2017, when he came to promote his novel, How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution.
The group wanted to host Pollak to show that conservative voices do exist on college campuses where liberal viewpoints are often dominant, said Kathleen Looney, the chapter’s co-president.
“It’s very evident in our classes — I think we’ve all had professors who had very left-leaning biases,” Looney said. “We want the students in Turning Point to come and learn. Turning Point USA is really focused on the fact that the liberal voice has been heard on campus for a while, and we’re excited to remind students that there’s another side to the story and [that] those students are here too.”
Pollak expressed similar sentiments in his reasons for coming to campus — to show conservative students that they aren’t alone.
“They often feel quite isolated on campus, so it’s important for them to know that conservatives are there for them, that we really care about them and we want them to feel supported,” Pollak said. “Also, it’s just really fun. I love talking to young people. College campuses are a lot of fun — there’s a lot of energy here.”
During his speech, Pollak spoke about a variety of major political issues, and his own background as a college student.
He said that as a student at Harvard Law School, it wasn’t easy being an outspoken conservative on a college campus.
“I got nasty messages and anonymous hate mail,” Pollak said. “People hated me. It was nasty, and it’s probably nastier now, if you support [President] Trump on campus.”
He also spoke at length about the 2016 election, and what ultimately caused Trump to win. Pollak boiled it down to three main points: Trump won because he talked about issues no one else wanted to discuss; he made excellent use of media coverage of him; and he worked harder than Hillary Clinton by holding more events in more states than she did.
Along with Pollak, Turning Point hopes to bring more conservative speakers to campus in the near future, including political commentator Ben Shapiro, who has recently been at the center of controversy over his planned speeches at UC Berkeley, where protests against conservative speakers gained national attention after turning violent.
“We haven’t had any backlash from the University having [Pollak] here, fortunately,” Looney said. “I have yet to see what is going to happen with Ben Shapiro, but we are expecting it to be a major feat to get Ben Shapiro here. It’s not only expensive to hire Ben Shapiro because he’s so popular, but the University also requires us to have security.”
Wow, small crowd.

Undocumented students at USC and universities across the nation have expressed concerns since President Trump decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era policy that guaranteed temporary legal status to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children.
To address these issues, USC student group Hermanos Unidos hosted a DACA Summit on Thursday night, bringing together people of all backgrounds, ethnicities and sexualities to discuss the future of DACA recipients and the undocumented immigrant community.
The summit began with Susan Ramirez, a staff psychologist at the Engemann Student Health Center, who discussed mental health strategies for attendees to practice in the case of a deportation.
“[Students should consider,] ‘Who is an identified contact outside this country? How long do you wait when somebody doesn’t come home? When do you take action?’” Ramirez said. “Being able to conversate is essential in setting up a game plan.”
Ramirez also shared a quote from an undocumented immigrant named Jong-Min You, who was interviewed for an article published by the American Psychological Association.
“[Undocumented immigrants] live in this invisible prison, stuck behind these invisible bars,” You said in the article. “I can’t drive, vote, study abroad or get a great-paying job. You think about what your peers can do and you can’t, so you sit in your invisible prison and get depressed.”
Ramirez shared this quote to provide context for audience members about what it is like to be an undocumented student. This led the way to a discussion about coping mechanisms and recognizing how to deal with the “what if” moments undocumented students may face when thinking about the termination of DACA.
Because the greater Los Angeles area has a high population of DACA recipients, Hermanos Unidos members found it important for students to have a comprehensive understanding of the program and renewal process.
Christian Guzman, the leader of Hermanos Unidos, said he wanted to make sure students knew that USC provides resources for DACA recipients and undocumented students as a whole.
Jean Reisz, who works at the Gould Immigration Clinic, provided Summit attendees with further information on the DACA renewal process and the University’s resources for DACA recipients. While those who never registered for the program are unable to receive DACA benefits, Reisz is working to make sure all current DACA recipients who are eligible renew their status before the Oct. 5 deadline.
However, not all attendees were undocumented immigrants. Rosa Escobar, a graduate student at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, came in support of her many coworkers who are DACA recipients.
“This is a major thing, and lots of people are going through such a tragedy,” Escobar said. “Lots are students just trying to get an education, and not knowing what’s going to happen to them is scary, especially knowing that all their hard work might go to waste.”
Escobar hopes that the University will continue defending DACA and keeping DACA recipients safe from deportation.
We definitely need to keep the discussion going.

The Interfraternity Council released a statement to the USC community on Thursday opposing the University’s new standards for recruitment eligibility, alleging that the policy was passed without much consideration or collaboration between student leaders and University officials.
The new policy will limit eligibility for the Greek recruitment process to students with a minimum USC grade point average of 2.5 and 12 completed units.
“I really hope that the administration at least acknowledges that we want to come to the table, we really want this mediated type of conversation,” said IFC president Alexander Cuoci. “[We want to] get the whole [USC] community to come together and have our voice be heard.”
The letter includes a three-fold proposal for the administration, which includes committing to a public meeting with supporters of the Greek community, creating a committee to provide solutions to address all parties’ concerns and agreeing to a non-binding mediation before an objective audience.
“Administrators are justifying this recruitment ban by pointing to peers and aspirant institutions,” the letter reads. “Meanwhile, USC is among the best universities in the world. The administration should look to its own students, alumni and faculty to address student health issues, instead of adopting policies from other institutions.”
Cuoci explains that these recruitment standards will limit freshman students’ opportunities to become involved on campus.
“Unilaterally implementing policy that limits a first-year student’s freedom of association with no meaningful input from student leaders is contrary to everything USC stands for,” the letter reads.
He also said that the Greek leaders were informed of the potential policy in the fall before the semester started, but they did not realize its approval would happen so soon without much consideration.
“We were never told this was going to be implemented until [Wednesday], when I sat down with [Provost Michael] Quick and he said, ‘This is going to happen,’” Cuoci said.
Cuoci hopes the administration will consider the opinions of student leaders and other stakeholders in the Greek community, especially when it comes to the effects the policy has on the system.
The Panhellenic Council also presented a letter opposing the new recruitment requirements, which was delivered to administrators and presented at the Undergraduate Student Government meeting on Tuesday.
Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.
