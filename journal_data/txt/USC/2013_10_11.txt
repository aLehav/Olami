The last time 30 Seconds to Mars toured, the band broke the Guinness World Record for Longest Concert Tour by a Rock Band, playing 311 shows for their  third studio multi-platinum album This Is War, released in 2009.

Four years later, the 15-year-old rock band, comprised of brothers Jared and Shannon Leto and Tomo Milicevic, released their fourth studio album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, in May of this year.
“For us it’s a new beginning; we really feel like we’ve come into our true sound with this record,” lead guitarist Milicevic said in an interview.
Since the release of their album, the band has gained critical acclaim and sent a copy of this new record into space. They launched their single “Up In The Air” aboard the Falcon 9 rocket on March 1. The world tour supporting the newest album will span ten months with 92 shows — 23 of which will take place in North America.
On September 14, they played the biggest music festival in the world — Rock In Rio. Four days later, the trio headed to London for the iTunes Festival.  The band’s performance at the iTunes Festival last month, which is available to view on iTunes gives fans a great preview of what to expect this weekend, including acrobatics on seesaws, giant balloons and intense lighting.
Milicevic says that performance in London was a fun and memorable and experience because of the variety of other performances he was able to see for himself and the artists he got to share the stage with.
“The festival is a shared experience with all of the bands and audiences there. It’s kind of a mish-mash of people,” Milicevic said. “It’s fun in the sense that you get to see people that you might not necessarily get the opportunity to to see and and play for.”
Less than a week later, they were on stage in Las Vegas for the iHeartRadio Music Festival. They made one last quick stop at the VMAs in Brooklyn, receiving their third award for their newest music video, and then jetted off to begin the North American leg of their world tour.
To say this band has been busy is an understatement.
The Los Angeles-based band returns to the City of Angels for the culmination of this second leg on October 12 at the Hollywood Bowl, a show Milicevic says the band is really looking forward to.
“L.A. is our home, no question,” Milicevic said. “Although we travel most of the year in other parts of the world, we’re always really excited to come home.”
Though Thirty Seconds to Mars has been actively touring since 2006, this will be their first time playing at the iconic amphitheater; thus they have dubbed it a “homecoming” concert.
“We really wanted to make that the destination of the journey — the final point,” Milicevic explained. “We can’t believe we have the opportunity to play there; it’s crazy, actually. It’s a dream come true for all of us and we’re really excited.”
While the band’s new album is something they’ve worked extremely hard on, Milicevic notes the responses that they have received from their audience have been  surprising, but in the best way. And this only encourages them to keep the momentum going in their performances.
“[We’ve] actually been playing a lot of new songs and people have been really enjoying it,” Milicevic said. “[We’re] lucky that people are wanting to hear the new stuff. Often it takes more time for people to get used to the album.”
When making music, Milicevic expressed that his passion for the creative process is what drives the music the band produces, despite what others may think.
“You’re not really too concerned what anybody’s going to think about it, let alone the fans of the previous music or the potential ones. You have to be true to your creativity and open to whatever’s happening.”
Though many bands receive criticism for either changing their music too much or not enough, Milicevic declares that pleasing audiences is not the motivation behind their music. He focuses instead on being true to their art and who they are as a band.
“You change with time so your music is going to change. When you’re in the process of creating the music, you’re doing it for yourself at that point,” Milicevic said. “It’s afterward, when you release the music, that you let it find its audience and you lose some, you gain some, but you can’t ever use that as the motivating factor to create something. I think you’d fail every time that way no matter what.”
30 Seconds to Mars performs at the Hollywood Bowl on Saturday, Oct. 12th at 7:30 p.m. With several surprises in store for the audience, Milicevic promises it’s a show worthing coming to.
“We’ll be playing practically every song from the new record. We’re going above and beyond for the Hollywood Bowl; it’s going to be a really special show. I wouldn’t miss it for sure.”

In a city as diverse as Los Angeles, the multitude of food, drink and various cultures gathering in one place seems hard to imagine. But this weekend, Artisanal L.A. brings all they have to offer to the Los Angeles community in their Fall 2013 show.

Starting Oct. 12th, Artisanal L.A. presents their Fall 2013 show, a weekend-long community shopping, tasting and overall learning experience featuring independent home goods and handmade edibles in Los Angeles and from various places in the United States. This seasonal show will feature a wide array of edible treats ranging from local butchers to donut makers, and other programming such as hands-on workshops, demos led from chefs, expert panels and speakers educating guests of everything from craft beer making to urban farming and also an opportunity to learn about various non-profit organizations changing the local food scene in Los Angeles.
Artisanal L.A. gives attendees the occasional opportunity shop from nearly 100 hand-selected food and drink artisans all in one place, bring the community together to experience all of the Los Angeles food scene. Many artisans launched their businesses through Artisanal L.A. before being available at farmers markets. In this struggling economy, this exciting event makes it easy for supports the state of economy, meet producers, discover new favorites and join the community while having fun with the increasing number of Angelenos who are eager to learn where their food comes from.
Shawna Dawson, the founder of  Artisanal L.A. event and USC alumnus from 1999 with a degree in bioethics and religion, expresses the cruciality of the state of the L.A. economy and what Artisanal L.A. provides for the community.
“If you’re looking at our local economy, things that are made in the U.S.A. or in L.A. have dollars that then stay here. When you have money that stays local, that’s where you see the real impact on the local economy.”
Dawson understands not only how her event gives back money to the local community, but the greater impact Artisanal L.A. has on the various businesses participating as well.
“Because we’re determined to take down barriers to entering the market for lesser known artisans and those who may be bringing their product to the public for the first time,” Dawson said in an interview, “including keeping booth fees and costs substantially lower than any similar event — the economics of this event can be challenging and finding the right venue is critical.”
One of the featured makers at Artisanal L.A. this season is Chocoboost, a handmade gourmet chocolate in very affordable pricing. President of Chocoboost Linda Dub and her partner Sharon Yaar immigrated from Israel four years ago, both going to school in vastly different fields and initially started this company as merely something fun to do in their spare time.
“The two of us are U.S. immigrants [from Israel]; we each have different career backgrounds,” Dub said. “In our country of origin, I hold a M.A. degree in public administration and organizational development [from Haifa University]. Sharon hold a B.S. in biology [from Ben Gurion University], worked in medical research industries and [we both] considered chocolate making merely a hobby.”
What started as a hobby turned into a successful business for Dub and Yaar. Coming from a different country proved to be a struggle in the beginning but that made the two even more determined to start this business.
“It was difficult to find similar careers because of the language barrier. However, sitting idle wasn’t an option,” Dub said. “So, being very energetic and self-motivated, we decided in 2012 to reinvent ourselves. We pushed to come up with products line that would represent our experience, values, knowledge, education and talents. Brainstorming and imagination gave birth to ChocoBoost.”
Nearly two years old, ChocoBoost is now a successful business, catering to various events from private events such as baby showers and weddings to professional events like conventions and business launching parties. Even with all of their success thus far, the two are still continuing to grow and have learned to never take anything for granted.
“What’s important for us is the learning process and not just the financial side of the business,” Dub said. “The fact that being active and positive is what’s helped us to adapt and assimilate into the new country. Because of our immigrant background we are always willing to help and really appreciate when people enlist to help us.”
This seasonal show gives money back to the local businesses by providing an outlet for business such as ChocoBoost and others to present themselves to L.A. and show the community who they are and expose the locality and what ingredients go into making everyone’s favorite food
“ChocoBoost bring to the L.A. community and to the event visitors a chocolate product line that is.” Dub said. “Freshly handmade from European chocolate, fine liquors, finest ingredients, natural flavors and no preservatives or corn syrup except in the marshmallows.”
More importantly, Dawson mentions how the ingredients in the food Angelenos eat drive the success of this event every event.
“I think that people are getting more curious about where their food and food products are coming from,” Dawson said. “Over the last few years, there has been a huge push to buy local and sustainable, and as that grows in trend-setting cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, I think you’ll see it gaining traction throughout the country.”
Artisanal L.A. starts this weekend, Oct. 12 and 13 from 11 a.m. -6 p.m., tickets range between $10 – $15.
