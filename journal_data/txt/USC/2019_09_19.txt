USC Football (2-1) is back home this week to take on No. 10 Utah (3-0) 6 p.m. Friday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Utah may be the Pac-12’s best all-around team. The Utes climbed to No. 10 in the nation while USC fell out of the AP Top 25 this week after its loss to Brigham Young. If Utah wins this game, it would be its first time beating the Trojans in the Coliseum. 
After a standout debut two weeks ago against Stanford, freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis’ lack of experience showed last week as he threw three interceptions against BYU. The silver lining to those interceptions? It’s clear that Slovis isn’t afraid to pull the trigger, although perhaps he is eager to a fault. 
This week against Utah, Slovis will be up against a better defense that includes All-Pac-12 first team junior cornerback Jaylon Johnson and two-time All-Pac-12 second team senior safety Julian Blackmon.
It will be important for the Trojans’ offensive line to protect Slovis this week, which is something it struggled with against BYU. Redshirt sophomore offensive tackle Jalen McKenzie said the key to getting to the second level and finishing blocks is to acknowledge how different opponents play each week.
“Utah’s linebackers like to come downhill, shoot the gaps to where you know that those double teams that you have are going to be quicker because you’re going to have to hit, get off, get to the linebacker,” McKenzie said.
Last week, BYU consistently dropped eight defenders into coverage, effectively shutting down offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s signature Air Raid offense to force the Trojans into their vulnerable run game, but Harrell continued to put the ball in the air. 
“I just call what I feel to be honest with you,” said Harrell regarding his approach when deciding whether to keep the ball on the ground.
Fans shouldn’t expect to see the Trojans waver from their passing game this week. Harrell said that if he could go back, he would not change any of the calls that he made in Provo, including the final pass play that resulted in a Slovis interception.
Harrell said that Slovis and the entire offense needs to be more detail-oriented.
“That comes down to being disciplined,” he said.
USC must also prepare for Utah’s strong run game on the other side of the ball. Senior running back Zack Moss is one of the best in the country and is adept at finding openings between tackles. The Trojan defense will need to contain Moss to keep Utah’s offense at bay.
Another challenge for the Trojans will be senior quarterback Tyler Huntley, a dual threat who leads the Utes’ offense with big plays both on the ground and through the air. Huntley has talented options downfield: Sophomore tight end Brant Kuithe is averaging over 20 yards per catch so far this season, while sophomore wide receiver Bryan Thompson is coming off a two-touchdown performance against Idaho State.
USC defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said that, based on Utah’s sharp offense and USC’s poor performance last week against BYU, the Trojans will need to clean up their tackling Friday.
This week’s game could provide some answers as to whether the Stanford victory or the BYU upset represents the true nature of Trojan football this season. Helton said he believes the BYU game was a fluke and that Slovis will be back in his groove Friday night.
“I would be shocked if he doesn’t have a great game,” Helton said. “He’s had a great week of practice. You can tell his jaw is set. He’s fired up to get back out on the field and prove something.” 
“So what, now what?” has been the Trojans’ mantra both in practice and on the sidelines this season. The saying seems appropriate now more than ever as the team heads into Friday’s game.

Alexia Sambrano’s art grapples with a lot. The bold, young artist paints and draws to unpack her views on social issues like mental health, sexuality and femininity using only a canvas and brush.
With assistance from her cousin, Sambrano, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science, first discovered the possibilities of art by drawing anime characters. As she continued developing her craftsmanship, her technique diversified from Japanese-influenced sketches to mediums like oil and acrylic painting. Now, Sambrano’s achievements in her creative technique has led her to present multiple paintings and prints at Divine Femininity, a USC art show curated by senior sociology major RaeAnn Noakes.
This show offered a variety of art by women, especially women of color and people who are part of the LGBTQ community. As Sambrano uses her art to define the intersectionality of her Mexican American culture with her bisexuality, first-generation status and other identities, her interest after discovering Divine Femininity through a friend was immediately piqued. Sambrano was also keen on presenting to a larger audience after having recently gained exposure in sharing art through platforms like Instagram and Etsy this past summer.
The largest painting Sambrano submitted to this event, “Impending Doom,” was a 24×32-inch acrylic canvas that displays a girl falling. Sambrano remarked that people have seen the painting as the girl drowning or falling through the sky, yet her original intent was to relate her emotions during a difficult transition. 
“I had a hard time my junior year [of high school],” Sambrano said. “I kind of felt out of place, like I was falling.”
Two other paintings that were presented, “Sweet” and “Lollipop,” provided a stark thematic contrast for “Impending Doom,” focusing more on specific women’s issues. These pieces are representations of female mouths, and Sambrano noted they have often been seen as “promiscuous” or “sexual.” She explained that female sexuality has often been created for the male gaze, but her pieces try to reclaim the female body away from that. 
“Me painting these pieces depicting women, whether it be with sexual undertones or just presenting them in their natural form. It’s not necessarily sexual — if anything, it’s more about reclaiming power back to our bodies,” Sambrano said. 
This focus on the female body is a common theme throughout Sambrano’s paintings. Although she originally depicted these bodies to express the body type she wanted, her explanations behind these pieces have transformed dramatically alongside her own mental, physical and emotional growth. Now, Sambrano paints these portraits to show women that beauty is not about having the ideal body. 
“You may not be society’s conventional beauty,” Sambrano said. “But you are a beauty within yourself. That is what I would like people to take away from my paintings. Appreciate yourself for who you are.”
Even though personal identity was an especially important component of Sambrano’s art during Divine Femininity, her other work explores a variety of themes and issues that are near to her heart.
One such issue is anxiety. One of Sambrano’s paintings — titled “La Ansiedad,” which translates to “The Anxiety” — depicts her face surrounded by a large collection of eyes. Sambrano noted that the painting can be construed as “chaotic,” but this is intentional in conveying her own complex emotions. 
“There’s a million eyes, there’s hair that kind of looks like Medusa,” Sambrano said. “You feel kind of trapped, and that is how I felt before making that painting and in the process of making that painting.”
As she pursues her majors in neuroscience and cognitive science, Sambrano cited her interest in science as one of her inspirations for her images. Her independent study of other artists and their relationship to neuroanatomy and neuroanatomical figures has helped her envision and improve drawing human figures.
“One thing that really fascinates me is how topics that seem super, super different can be superimposed and are actually a lot more similar than you imagined,” Sambrano said. 
As Sambrano works toward these two majors and an LGBTQ studies minor, she hopes to one day attend graduate school for research or work at a non-profit organization. She wants to research neurodegenerative diseases and mental illness within minority populations in the future. 
In regard to art, Sambrano’s short term goals are to produce enough to help her parents pay for her college education. Currently, she is working on a painting that involves a heart placed on a jean jacket with flowers emerging from it. It’s a piece that continues the intersection of science and art in her life.
“Eventually when it’s done, what I envision is for it to have flowers,” Sambrano said. “For it to be a symbol of not just science and what I’m studying, but also understanding that there is love within.”
Sambrano’s art can be seen on her Instagram and Etsy page @alexiasambranoart.

There is no shame in admitting that some of us drink wine for the aesthetics. It wouldn’t be the first time someone daydreams of standing on the rooftop with a glass of red wine in hand overlooking the city’s skyline. Can’t you just imagine that Instagram-worthy shot? One of the great things about wine is that it can transform your Instagram game. Here are some of the most Instagrammable wines that not only look fabulous but also taste delicious:
Usual Wines
Enriched with a satisfying sip of bing cherries, dark chocolate and fresh violets, the red wine from Usual Wines is a total game-changer for photography enthusiasts. The red wine hails from California’s very own Sonoma County and comes bottled in a cone-shaped glass that resembles the equipment of a sophisticated scientist. It’s modern and chic, two things everyone wants in an Instagram photo. Not only is it pleasing to look at, but with just the first sip you can feel the mystery of a solitary walk in the hills without the discomfort of being lost. In that sense, it’s an approachable wine. It’s sold online in packs, but they sell by the glass exclusively at the Hi-Lo Liquor Market in Culver City for $7 — and if reds are not your cup of tea, they also offer rosé and brut. 
The Marigny’s 2018 Carbonic Pinot Gris
Often referred to as ‘‘the orange wine from Oregon,’’ this is perhaps the most hip wine in Los Angeles (for the record, orange wine is not an actual term — it just refers to the color of the wine). A skin-contact pinot grigio sourced from the Willamette Valley in Oregon, the wine enchants its drinker with an experience of sun-toasted herbs and sour green olives mixed with a refreshing hint of grapefruit (ideally served slightly chilled). Just in time for the arrival of autumn, the color and shape of the wine will fit into any Thanksgiving table or picnic in a bed of fallen yellow-orange leaves. This is a wine you don’t want to miss out on, so snag a bottle while you can. It costs $32 per bottle at Hi-Lo Liquor Market.
2018 Paper Planes “Flight School” — Rosé
Rosé in a can? Yes, that’s a thing, and it is a revolutionary experience for wine drinkers. Enclosed in a 250mL can, this Russian Valley’s rosé from Sonoma County is for the casual, laidback crowd. Aesthetically pleasing with millennial pink wrapping and confetti printed around the can, this rosé is meant to be shared and is ideal for group photos at any party. Grown in a cooler climate than most rosé in California, this wine tastes crisp with a mixture of strawberries and watermelons that brings the tropical vibes to L.A. Perhaps an even better connection to the city is that Paper Planes co-founders Laura and Kyle Gabriel left careers in film and music in L.A. to launch it. It costs $8 per can at Hi-Lo Liquor Market.
May these wines help you on the first few steps toward becoming a more sophisticated Instagram influencer. Pink, red, white, yellow, orange – whatever your theme might be, there is most likely a wine that will suit your Instagram aesthetic. Next time you drink wine, be sure to snap a photo and share the experience.

FivePoint donated $1 million to the Price School of Public Policy last week. Emile Haddad, the chairman and CEO of FivePoint, made the donation to encourage more conversation regarding sustainability.  
Price Dean Jack Knott and Lusk Center Director Richard Green said the donation will help support faculty hires in the real estate program, which has grown in recent years. Price hopes to hire another senior faculty member in the program and will use the funds to help pay for this person’s research and other expenses. 
“We now have a large undergraduate major in real estate and a master’s degree in real estate, so we’re hiring additional real estate faculty,” Knott said.  
Green said the donation will fund student scholarships and a series of talks on sustainable communities.   
“[This scholarship] will make it easier for a few students to afford to come to USC and study real estate,” Green said. “If we could get even one or two students that we otherwise couldn’t get because of cost, that’s a win.” 
A portion of the gift will fund “disruptive dialogues,” which Knott said will focus on innovation within sustainable development. 
“Students are going to be involved in this,” Knott said. “We’re going to hold a series of events that [Haddad] likes to call dialogues, with key stakeholders to change behavior and change policy.”  
According to Knott, Haddad hopes the discussions will help start a larger conversation regarding climate change, sustainability and the environment between USC and surrounding communities to create change.    
“[Haddad] wants to initiate a set of dialogues between the University and the development community and the government on what these communities would look like, what kind of regulations and zoning we would need to make this happen [and] what kind of mindset and goals private developers should have in order to achieve these kinds of sustainable communities,” Knott said.
Andy Kim, a sophomore studying real estate, expressed the importance of sustainability in real estate for himself and for Price. 
“One of the public areas of public policy I feel that should be publicized more is actually sustainability,” Kim said. “I’m very happy to hear that [Haddad] is able to give such a generous donation for Price to really talk about sustainability more.”

Kevin Feige, a USC alumnus and president of Marvel Studios, has joined the School of Cinematic Arts Board of Councilors, USC announced Tuesday.
“I am beyond thrilled to join the School of Cinematic Arts Board of Councilors,” Feige said in the statement. “I look forward to working with Dean Elizabeth Daley and my esteemed colleagues on the Board to continue the School’s visionary approach to shaping the next generation of creators and leaders in the entertainment industry.”
The Board of Councilors oversees planning, development and fundraising efforts at SCA. Notable board members include filmmakers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, writer Shonda Rhimes and director Robert Zemeckis. 
“Kevin has been the driving force behind some of the industry’s largest films and franchises,” said Board of Councilors chair Frank Price. “His vast knowledge and experience will help us as we continue to navigate through this continuously changing entertainment landscape. We are incredibly proud of all that he has accomplished and thrilled to have him join the Board.”
Feige graduated from SCA’s production division in 1995 and has remained active in the alumni network, often employing SCA alumni on his sets. In 2007, Feige became president of production at Marvel Studios and has producing credits on many of the studio’s blockbuster hits, including “The Avengers,” “Iron Man” and “Captain America: The First Avenger”.
Feige also often makes appearances in Theatrical Film Symposium, a class that screens upcoming films and hosts discussions with cast and crew afterwards. He has organized and spoken at various events on campus including “10 Years of Marvel” and a 90th anniversary celebration for SCA. 
“Kevin Feige is not only a leader and unparalleled creative force in film and television, but he’s also a dedicated alum and partner for the School of Cinematic Arts,” Daley wrote in the letter. “We’re thrilled he’s joining the Board and his vision and enthusiasm will be an incredible resource in shaping the future of the school.”
Kevin Chi, a sophomore majoring in philosophy with a minor in SCA, believes Feige will be a positive addition to the board.
“I think the decision is great because that means another accomplished individual from the film industry is going to be guiding USC,” Chi said. “USC is already a very prominent film school and with his addition, the school will become even better.” 
Dubbing Feige as the “Steve Jobs of film and television,” Bryan Vaca, a junior majoring in business administration who takes classes at SCA, said he believes Feige will help the School become even more of a global power.
“I think he will bring a creative and innovate influence to SCA, if anything more than it is right now,” Vaca said. “His expertise on the cinematic global scale is not to be overlooked and (can) surely bring a wealth of opportunities and perspectives to SCA.”

Several years ago when USC alumnus Nick Dazé and his wife had a baby, they searched for a new home to rent. But they ran into several issues along the way, including false information, scam listings and having issues with the landlord at the home they ended up signing on. He tried out several business ideas since then to help renters dealing with the same issues before creating Pocket List, a company that helps renters learn more information about the properties they’re looking into. 
Dazé worked with fellow alumnus Julian Vergel de Dios to create a website that help renters find and bookmark their dream apartments, so they’re notified when the space goes on the market. The app also allows renters to look up reviews on the quality of features like light, sound and parking and to look at current rent rates at each apartment for free. 
“Our biggest differentiator is that we are allowing people to see details about apartments that they can’t find anywhere else because we’re not talking to landlords,” said Vergel de Dios, who graduated from the Viterbi School of Engineering in 2009. “We’re talking to people that actually lived in their apartments.”
The company considers college students a target audience because most students know the exact date of when they move out. 
Dazé said the company’s name originates from a term used by residential real estate agents to describe a house that is ready for selling but is not advertised to the open market.
“We’re essentially taking the concept of the friend that knows about a cool apartment opening up in a few months and opening that up to the entire country,” said Dazé, who graduated from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 2006. “We think that why this is really useful for college students who are going to want to plan ahead for life after graduation, especially if they want to figure out, kind of a complex living situation.”
The pair launched the manual version of the app in June 2019 after working at the USC Viterbi Startup Garage in Marina Del Rey for a year under director David Eastman. 
“They saw what customers wanted and tweaked their offering before moving into Pocket List, and all of a sudden they have struck gold,” Eastman said. “They suddenly have a ton of people signing up. They have suddenly raised a bunch of extra money. So in that sense, I think the entrepreneurs are really solid.”
The founders credit the workspace with providing a space to seek advice, collaborate with other entrepreneurs and work on daily tasks.
While the app is currently only open to Los Angeles customers, Dazé said Pocket List plans to expand to every major city by spring 2020, acquiring more customers through a combination of social media advertising, content creation, events and outreach. 
In terms of workflow, Vergel de Dios handles all the technical and engineering aspects of the company as Chief Technology Officer.

Study Hall, a popular bar located on Hoover and West 29th Streets, may close its doors by the end of the semester, Annenberg Media reported Monday.
USC Housing Director Christopher Ponsiglione wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan that the restaurant’s lease with the University will end in December. Ponsiglione said USC Housing is planning a building renovation project that will take place this summer to address maintenance, plumbing, electrical and access issues on the first floor. 
“We are considering multiple options and opportunities for the use of the existing space moving forward,” Ponsiglione wrote. “The renovation project is in the design phase, and a final plan for the use of the first floor space has not yet been determined.”
Study Hall representatives declined an interview with the Daily Trojan, but said the restaurant has no set plans for its future. 
Harry Kim, the restaurant’s co-owner, told Annenberg Media Monday that the restaurant would officially close in December. In response to the news, many students and alumni took their frustration to social media. 
Vianca Marquez, a 2017 alumnus who majored in English, said she frequented the bar with friends since its 2014 opening. She added that her experience at the eatery was filled with good food and memories. 
“It’s always been a place where I can go, even if it’s just to vent to my friends, a common place where everyone likes to gather and it caters to everyone’s preferences,” Marquez said. “So it’s not just wings or fries — there’s an extensive menu that everyone can be happy with.”
Haley Hudkins, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, said she lives across the street from Study Hall and often sees the restaurant drawing in crowds on game days. 
“It seems like … a good place to hang out, and we don’t really have a ton of those on campus, so I’m kinda sad that it’s closing down, or supposedly closing down,” she said. “I hope that they stick it out because we can always use some nice hangout spots on campus.”
Hudkins also commented on how difficult it might be for local businesses to compete with the restaurants at USC Village.
 “I feel like it’s getting hard for restaurants that are nearby to kind of succeed and keep on going because [USC Village] is opening a lot of new restaurants,” Hudkins said. “As USC Village continues to expand, I’m sure that it’s going to continue to make it harder, not just for Study Hall but also just restaurants around campus.”
Ponsiglione said the building, which houses the restaurant and two floors of student residents, has rented to outside vendors since 2009. Previous vendors include 29th Street Cafe, which was replaced by Study Hall in 2014.

The USC men’s and women’s tennis teams both had impressive 2018 seasons and will look to build on that success in their upcoming campaigns. 
Under the guidance of former head coach Peter Smith, the men’s team compiled a 22-8 record and a No. 8 national ranking. The team reached the NCAA Super Regionals, losing to North Carolina. 
Following Smith’s resignation this summer, new head coach Brett Masi hopes to keep the program headed in the right direction. Masi has an impressive background, winning Big 12 and West Coast Coach of the Year awards during his time at Texas Tech and San Diego University, respectively. He will look to translate this success to USC. 
“The expectations at USC are always that we want to win national titles,” Masi said. “I don’t think that’s going to change. The team has that as a goal … Just because I’m a new head coach — that won’t change.”
While Masi understands the team’s lofty aspirations, he knows it can’t win a championship overnight and wants his players to focus on improving throughout the fall.
“It’s about a process of just building confidence and belief in ourselves, and the results will come from that,” Masi said. “If we have success in terms of wins, trophies and things like that, that’s great, that’s always the ultimate goal. But I want us to see our guys go out there and play well.”
As the son of a basketball coach, Masi values team chemistry and strives to create a tight-knit group of players that represent the University’s commitment to excellence. 
“I’m a big team guy, even in an individual sport like tennis,” Masi said. “I really want our team to be close and cohesive.”
Senior Brandon Holt showed off his talent last season as the ninth best singles player in the collegiate level, reaching the quarterfinals in the 2019 NCAA Individual Championships. Holt and his partner, senior Riley Smith, ranked as the 14th best doubles pair last season. As he heads into his final year as a Trojan, Holt hopes to build upon his past accomplishments. 
The team has plenty of newcomers this year with freshmen Stefan Dostanic, Ryder Jackson, Colter Smith and redshirt freshman Rae Lan. USC will start its first tournaments Thursday in the Milwaukee Tennis Classic and the Battle in the Bay in San Francisco. 
The women’s team had similar success last season with a 20-8 record, ranking No. 16 in the nation. The Trojans were knocked out of the NCAA tournament in the Round of 16 against the South Carolina Gamecocks. 
Head coach Alison Swain hopes to lead the team to the same level of success that she did previously at Williams College, where she brought the Ephs eight NCAA Division III Championships. 
The 2019-20 season marks the final year for seniors Constance Branstine, Angela Kulikov, Sydney Van Alphen and Becca Weissmann, who hope to finish their college careers on a winning note. 
The team brought in new recruits freshmen Carson Branstine, Eryn Cayetano and Payton Saca, who will round out a group that looks poised to make a deep run at a national title. 
Like the men’s team, the women will begin its season at the Milwaukee Tennis Classic and the Battle in the Bay. In last year’s Battle in the Bay tournament, the Trojans showed their dominance by winning both the singles and doubles divisions. The team is hoping for a repeat of these titles in this year’s competition. 
Both teams bring in high expectations for the upcoming tournaments and the season as a whole. Both squads value player development and wins on the court and are ready to build on an impressive 2018 season to establish USC as one of the nation’s premier tennis schools.

Following its 3-1 run at the Inland Empire Classic this past weekend, the No. 5 USC men’s water polo team will look to improve its defensive effort in its first home game of the season against No. 9 Long Beach State Thursday.
After USC broke its 55-game winning streak over No. 2 UC Santa Barbara in a 13-9 loss Sunday, head coach Marko Pintaric stressed the program’s need to refocus on its next ranked opponent.
“Our priority is defense,” Pintaric said. “We lost our first game against Santa Barbara because we played poor defense. [We] allowed too many goals overall in the first official four games of the season because of poor defense. So our maximum effort will be to tighten up those issues that showed, and I’m looking forward to [seeing] how the guys will respond to that.”
Long Beach State also participated in the Inland Empire Classic, posting three wins against Whittier College, Concordia University and Air Force as well as one loss against No. 8 Pepperdine University to improve its overall record to 6-2. 
The 49ers’ scoring drives are something to keep an eye on, as they have eight players boasting a shot percentage at or above 0.700. Sophomore utilities Matt Morris and Garrett Zaan both collected 7 goals in the tournament, while redshirt senior attacker Austin Stewart racked up an impressive 15 scores. Their performance has not gone unnoticed by USC.
“[We spent] a day and a half watching films, watching to analyze our play over the weekend, to show the good and bad stuff that we did, so we can fix our problems,” Pintaric said. “And [we watched] what Long Beach [State] did the last couple of weeks, so we can make an adjustment and play the best game possible on Thursday.”
USC will rely on a strong group of goalies to counter the offensive firepower of Long Beach State. Junior Vaios Vlahotasios had an impressive first tournament with 21 saves, while sophomore Nic Porter had eight saves and sophomore Jere Ashby had nine saves in his first appearance as a Trojan.
The Trojans are also expected to continue as an offensive powerhouse after strong appearances last weekend from sophomore two-meter Jake Ehrhardt, junior driver Jacob Mercep and senior driver Marin Dasic. With 26 goals total from the three players across the first four tournament games of the season, it is unlikely that their scoring effort will slow down Thursday. Dasic hit a career milestone by passing the 100 goal mark during the Inland Empire Classic.
“I believe nothing is changing honestly,” Dasic said. “It is flattering and shows the work that I’ve put in, but I honestly think nothing should change, and I should just keep going and focus on the games, focus on the next win.”
Dasic also said that while the priority is defense, the team continues to work fiercely on the offensive side in order to outscore Long Beach State’s high-scoring attack.
“We know what to focus on, what we should improve on, and definitely our defense,” Dasic said. “On offense, we kind of executed what we were supposed to, and we scored nine goals [against Santa Barbara], which is also good.”
Last season’s two wins against Long Beach State came at the end of the season, when the Trojans were able to best the 49ers’ combined 14 points with their total of 27. But with a rare upset loss against Santa Barbara in the back of the players’ minds, the team is taking this opportunity to address its weaknesses.  
“We take every game as a test to correct our mistakes and to get the team better,” Pintaric said. “Every game is super serious, as if it’s the most important game of the season.”
USC’s first home game of the season against the Beach begins 5 p.m. Thursday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

Sports is sometimes viewed as a frivolous topic. Non-sports fans often see it as a means of entertainment on a lazy weekend night. But what many people fail to see is the impact that sports has made throughout the globe and behind the scenes of what they see on their screens. 
From generating national pride during international competitions to providing a source of solace from daily struggles to empowering young athletes, the impact of sports is undeniable.
Just in our backyard, at the Banc of California Stadium, the Los Angeles community experiences this impact first hand. It is hard to believe that the Los Angeles Football Club played its inaugural game only a year and a half ago. Finishing the best regular season for an MLS expansion team and boasting the best record in Major League Soccer this season, LAFC has already made a respectable name for itself. 
What has made the rise of LAFC even more impressive is the rapid growth of its loyal fan base. Ever since the MLS awarded L.A. the new team in 2014, the passion for LAFC has been on full display. Without even knowing the names of the club or the players in the team’s early stages, many fans started to support the team simply because it’s based in L.A. In their eyes, an L.A. team is their team. The LA Galaxy claims the Los Angeles name but plays half an hour away from the city. LAFC plays in the heart of L.A. And for me, LAFC is Los Angeles’ team. 
The 3252 — LAFC’s Independent Supporters Union — has been bursting with undying loyalty and love for its club. The name refers to the 3,252 seat capacity at the north end of the Banc of California Stadium where energized supporters are constantly standing and singing for the entirety of their club’s games. The 3252 unites thousands of fans across the city and beyond with their shared love for LAFC to create one of the best atmospheres for soccer fans in the nation. It has garnered worldwide recognition for representing the rise of soccer in the United States.
While watching LAFC’s stellar performance on the pitch is entertaining enough, attendees of LAFC home games must also take time to watch the north end. You can see the passion each person has for the game and for the team. With their collective disappointment in losses and their tight embraces and loud cheers after wins, it’s evident just how much the team means to them.
Even inside the stadium, the impact that LAFC has had on the city is clear. Thousands of people with different backgrounds unite to cheer on the Black & Gold in a stadium that would quite literally not exist if not for the MLS expanding to L.A.
I remember first hearing of LAFC’s inaugural match months before I graduated high school and moved out to USC. As an avid soccer fan, watching recap videos of the home games made me even more excited and impatient for my move to L.A. The chants, the tifos, the scarves, the passion, the pride — it was surreal for me to think that this was all going to be right next door. Seeing the energy, enthusiasm and love that surrounded the team at every angle made me eager to wear a black and gold jersey and call L.A. my home and LAFC my team.
For me, L.A. is a dream come true. No, it is not perfect. No city is. However, it’s the imperfections that foster our desire for growth. It’s the struggles and how we rise from them that deepen our love for the city. The diversity that lies within the limits of L.A. is unmatched, which is why it amazes me even more that we are able to unite as one for the place we call home. 
LAFC shows us how powerful and impactful sports can really be. It has been able to bring together thousands across L.A. through their pride in the city and the team, and Banc of California Stadium has become a place where everyone can set their differences aside and cheer together as one.

With only six days between their disappointing defeat at BYU and their upcoming match against No. 10 Utah, the Trojans have taken advantage of every second of practice this past week. 
“I loved how they jumped right back out here and jumped right back into work,” head coach Clay Helton said Monday. “[The team is] looking forward to the next opportunity to compete against a good Utah football team.”
To call the Utah team talented is an understatement. Led by a pair of seniors, quarterback Tyler Huntley and running back Zack Moss, the Utes have crushed all competition so far this season. The 3-0 team shows no areas of apparent weakness — it has scored 96 points this season while allowing just 29.
With offensive coordinator Graham Harrell at USC’s play-calling helm, the name of the Trojans’ game will be comfortability and execution.
“You’ve gotta figure out, what does the quarterback execute at a high level?” Harrell said. “What does he feel comfortable with? What does he see well? And if you call those plays, they usually work.”
Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis appeared to be out of his element last week facing BYU’s rush-three, drop-eight defense. The Cougars forced Slovis into tough situations, leading him to throw two interceptions in the first quarter and one more in overtime. On top of his passing woes, the young quarterback seemed unprepared to hand off the ball in times of need. 
This week, the coaches said the team will incorporate the ground game within Harrell’s typically pass-heavy offense. They claim Slovis is prepared to face Utah’s dominant defense.
“When you’re talking about this Utah front, you’re looking at four or five [future] NFL players,” Helton said. “It’ll be a great challenge for our offensive line. I told our guys in the team meeting right off the bat, this is going to be a big man’s game. I think that whoever controls the offensive and defensive fronts will win the game.”
While the USC team doesn’t quite match Utah’s for size, the Trojan offense brings confidence and discipline into Friday’s home faceoff. 
“No matter what the situation is, no matter what the play is, we have to be disciplined enough to continue to adjust our reads,” Harrell said. “We’ve got to be disciplined enough to just do our job and focus on our job every single snap.”
If the Trojan offense can focus on its job rather than the unfavorable odds, it may have a chance to pull out an upset at the Coliseum. Slovis will need to rely on his formidable rushing squad, namely junior Stephen Carr and redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai, to infiltrate the Utes’ drop-focused defense.
The team must set its sights forward this week in order to avoid a mid-season slump. Slovis remains confident in the team’s ability to rebound from last week’s trap loss to BYU.
“It’s no different,” Slovis said. “In every level of football, I’ve faced some form of adversity … It’s a learning curve, and you’ve got to adjust and get better.”

“You are what you eat.” While cheesy, this statement truly highlights the impact of food and how it encompasses a big part of my own identity. As I’ve grown up, my taste buds have evolved, and Asian cuisine has emerged as one of my top food preferences. Moving to a place like USC has only strengthened my appreciation for Asian food and how it connects to my cultural identity.
Several times throughout my first year, I felt nostalgic and homesick. It was my first time away from home, and even though I grew up in the Bay Area, Los Angeles provides a completely different scene. I turned to comfort food and spent my time scouring campus to find food that reminded me of home.
My initial discovery came in the form of a very fortunate surprise: the Parkside Dining Hall. 
Walking to the dining hall, I thought it would be a run-down student cafeteria serving pizza and sloppy joes. Luckily, these preconceptions faded away as I swiped my ID card and was greeted by a bistro bar serving large bowls of fried rice. 
The aroma was powerful and reminiscent of the dim sum restaurants back home, which only got better when I customized the ingredients I wanted in my dish. Scooping rice out of the bowl, I felt as if I had been transported back to my childhood self as I enjoyed my first meal at my family’s favorite Chinese restaurant. My delight didn’t stop there, as I found out that the bistro rotates its personalized offerings, featuring options ranging from heartwarming pho bowls to tender bulgogi — cuisines I had taken to during our countless day trips to San Francisco. 
While the dining hall, by far, exceeded my expectations, my one trip to Tutor Hall Café inside the Viterbi School of Engineering a week later was all I needed. Wanting to expand my horizons beyond the dining hall, I was mainly attracted by the café’s banh mis, a food I had discovered only the year before through a food truck at my local shopping mall. Although the meal was not fabulous, its food-truck style packaging and its overly spicy peppers conjured up memories of my first experience eating the sandwich. 
At this point, I was unsure whether my dining hall could be topped in terms of Asian cuisine variety. However, a trip to Fertitta Café in Fertitta Hall led me into Asian heaven. The restaurant hosts numerous stations and offers almost every type of Asian food. Bite-sized dumplings, customizable ramen bowls, delicious banh mi and freshly made sushi are only a handful of the options available. The scene brought me back to my family’s annual Christmas Eve buffet, where my uncle hosted the extended family in his restaurant to serve everyone a feast that encompassed cuisines from Japanese sushi to Chinese chow mein. Looking back, I probably ended up making my way over to Fertitta Café at least twice a week last year because of this fond memory.
Still not satisfied, I followed a suggestion from a friend and headed to the Law School Café on the bottom floor of the Musick Law Building. I had already ventured away from my central sphere of culinary familiarity with Fertitta Hall and was ready to continue exploring. 
Entering the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the place served not only the recommended salmon rice bowls but also boba tea — something I had occasionally enjoyed getting on late nights with friends. Even though I didn’t have either much back home, I was reassured to know all of my desired Asian cuisines were covered.
As I reflect, ultimately, food is one of the most definitive ways to express my culture and identity. It’s much more than nourishment — it plays a key role in how we view ourselves and can create long-lasting memories. Importantly, food can bond people, especially in Asian culture where meals are generally family style. I can’t count the endless amounts of dim sum meals I’ve had over the years I’ve traveled to see my family in Utah. However, being able to easily access the same dishes at Parkside Dining Hall or Fertitta Café has allowed me to reminisce on the good times I’ve had with my relatives.
Food calls to mind fond memories of family, friends, special occasions and travels. Above all, it defines tradition, be it a special celebration or just the comfort found in recipes passed from generation to generation. 
I applaud USC for providing a wide range of cuisines and acknowledging different cultures beyond the token offering of Panda Express in Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The University should be commended for understanding the role of food in expressing one’s culture and identity and for its diligence in hosting a Chinese New Year dinner in the Parkside dining hall. 
Nothing has the power to lift spirits and fuel souls more than the fulfillment of nostalgic cravings.

As students finalize their class schedules for the rest of the semester, one issue nearly every new student faces selecting their general education courses. 
Unfortunately, USC’s general education system and its current requirements structurally discourage intellectual exploration and do not provide students with a balanced education. Under the current program, the allotment of registration times drastically limits the options students have when selecting GE courses. In addition, USC’s GE requirements allow students to create class schedules that they believe to be easy at the expense of attaining skills vital to success during and after college. 
To remedy this, USC needs to develop a new core curriculum. This revamped curriculum would require that students take one GE class selected by the University each semester until graduation. The new structure would end the race to register for GE courses that takes place every year and also require that students take eight pre-selected courses designed to ensure that all students are provided with the academic basis needed not only to function in our complex world but to also be active and informed participants in it.
One of the first issues students encounter with the structure of USC’s current GE program is that registering for the necessary classes is a virtual free-for-all in which only those who register first survive. Registration times are based on units earned, which inherently favors upperclassmen.
As a result, a lot of the University’s most interesting and engaging GE courses are closed for registration by the time underclassmen begin registering. This is especially troubling because general education requirements are meant to provide students with opportunities to explore new interests early on during their time at USC. If someone realizes that diplomacy is their life’s calling after a GE class on international relations, the realization will be of little use if they are two weeks from graduating instead of two weeks from declaring a major. 
However, the issue is not only appicable to new students — even upperclassmen have difficulty registering for classes. What is perhaps even more worrisome is that upperclassmen face this issue when graduation is just on the horizon and every course could be the difference between graduation and additional semesters.
Another notable issue with the GE system as it is currently offered is that it incentivizes students to prioritize an easy A over studying a subject they actually care about. Because the current GE program offers students myriad choices, many simply opt to take the easiest class that fits their schedule. Why take a difficult class on climate change when every review of Life in the Universe says there’s almost no work required, and nearly every student that takes the class gets an A?
Evidently, something is wrong. USC’s GE system forces many into classes they do not truly want to take and oftentimes does not allow the intellectual exploration the University claims to offer its students. Fortunately, it can be fixed with a new core curriculum. 
Rather than having 10 to 12 complex and pretentiously named categories from which students select classes, USC needs to implement a new GE program in which every student takes eight uniform courses, known as a core curriculum.   
 A core curriculum would also disincentivize students from avoiding courses they are interested in for an easy A. Bad professors will always exist, unfortunately, but with a core curriculum, students can’t switch into an obscure class on botany in film.
The curriculum could also be standardized so that all incoming students discuss the same subjects and analyze the same readings. Every student taking first-semester literature would read and analyze the same texts at the same time.
The result would be not only more broadly educated students but also a deeper sense of community among underclassmen as they tackle similar problems and questions together. The practice is not revolutionary and has been successfully utilized by universities like Columbia for quite some time. 
A stronger core curriculum is integral to preparing USC undergraduates for life after college. Many believe the segment of their four-year degree that makes them the most employable is their major. But increasingly, employers say that they already expect to train employees in specialized skills associated with their jobs. 
Only four years ago, USC revamped its GE requirements. It is about time the University consider doing it again.

The “Windows of Fantasy” exhibit in the Helen Lindhurst Gallery in Watt Hall is displaying art in 3D form from the Roski School of Art and Design’s own studio art program.
“We have three very loosely named areas in studio art: 2D, 3D and 4D,” said Jud Fine, a Roski professor of sculpture who assisted in putting the exhibition together. “This is the 3D area [show], so it features sculpture and ceramics.”
Fine helped curate pieces over the past week alongside professors Ruben Ochoa and Thomas Mueller, and a few students from Fine’s advanced sculpture class helped install the show. They selected pieces from a wide range of artists who used a variety of materials, from ceramics and wood to rope and moss. Many of Roski’s sculpture courses are represented in the exhibit: ceramics, studio classes, pottery and advanced art. 
The show was designed to reflect the freedom afforded to artists working within sculpture and to celebrate what sets them apart. Fine argues that, unlike painting, sculpture has the capacity to interact with the space it’s placed in.
“Sculpture is everything,” Fine said. “All the other categories [of art] will fit into sculpture but sculpture doesn’t necessarily fit into them. Sculpture has this arrogance of being everything.”
“Windows of Fantasy” uses this idea of space to thematically unify the diverse work on display. Each piece not only takes up space but interacts with it in some way. A mattress leans against one corner; two tall, thin figures lounge on a sofa, using a wall for support — they all use the room’s features for different purposes.
“[All the pieces here] deal with space in different ways, which is why the show is called ‘Window of Fantasy,’’’ Thomas said. “It’s about how each of us judge and interpret space.”
Fine and his students took great care when installing the exhibition, keeping the show’s theme in mind. They constructed unique pedestals for every piece, both for visual flair and to ensure that each was visible from everywhere in the room. The team wanted to create a cohesive experience which could subtly guide the attention of the viewer. 
“The initial idea was to set up a show that got the viewer to move around the space,” Fine said. “We choreographed it by the way the objects are placed. There are these little spatial zones that aren’t in competition with each other.”
Unlike many galleries, none of the pieces include nameplates or any other specific information about the individual work. Without this context to separate the sculptures from one another, the gallery presents itself as one cohesive experience.
“They’re all separate, but they interact with one another and alter the space,” said junior Anissa Santos, a junior majoring in media arts and practices who attended the exhibition. “The gallery would feel very different if one of these pieces were taken out. They don’t include nameplates or anything, which creates this feeling of unification in the school.”
The “Windows of Fantasy” exhibit closes Sept. 26. The studio art program will also feature a 4D area show next month.

“Ayoni, a rising R&B singer from Barbados,” is how Paper Magazine describes Thornton School of Music’s Ayoni Thompson. 
Despite the nod from the famed culture publication, in her own eyes, Ayoni’s artistry is not constrained by a simple descriptor like rhythm and blues; and, while it showcases her Barbadian roots, it also transcends them. 
Ayoni is a rockstar. But it doesn’t have to be said — you’ll see it, you’ll hear it and you’ll feel it. 
Music birthed by Ayoni goes beyond adjective — and it intentionally goes beyond genre.
 “I would hope that when people describe my music they’d be stressed trying to figure out who  it sounds like,” Ayoni said.
The junior in USC’s popular music program released her first single, “Divine,” to rave reviews on Sept. 6 — including a debut in Essence Magazine and a feature on Ones To Watch. The breadth of visibility she earned with the song is a dream for any new artist, but for Ayoni, regardless of opinion, she’s personally obsessed with the song. 
 “The best art is art is that is just so sure of itself,” Ayoni said. “It doesn’t really matter if you love it, doesn’t matter if you hate it.” 
Such is Ayoni’s attitude toward reviews, positive or negative. And “Divine,” after two years in the making, was sure of itself. 
The pop-electric track that flirts with Caribbean influences is the singer’s affirmation to herself. While writing “Divine,” Ayoni was freshly in love and thinking about how her new relationship was flooded with “such unconditional love,” as she described it, one “that society [doesn’t] show Black women in general.” 
Ayoni basks in this love, conveying it through lyrics like “Noble enough flaunt me on your crest now baby.” 
Beyond the glory of her personal relationship, and a message stemming from her experience as a black woman, upon its release, she realized there was more power behind “Divine” than she thought. 
The day the track dropped, “Divine” mixer and fellow Thornton student Cole Mitchell told her that some of his black queer friends were touched to see her speaking up for the LGBTQ community in her Essence feature. In the piece, she described the track as “the peoples’ song.” The track’s success showed her that music’s power has no limit.
The two years Ayoni worked on “Divine” did not only tell the tale of her craftsmanship but of her time as a student at USC. 
Coming to the Thornton school in 2017 was a catalyst in Ayoni’s growth as an artist. Her music career moved beyond something she did within the walls of her bedroom to a commitment to learning her craft at the highest level possible.
She credits her ongoing Thornton education with elevating the complexity of her performances and increasing comfortability on the stage. The school has also continued to push her to be open to critique and criticism — specifically, criticism from “living legend,” as Ayoni calls her, Patrice Rushen.
Rushen is the chair of USC’s popular music program; known for her blending of jazz, pop and R&B in the ’70s and ’80s. Most notably, Rushen is the composer and artist behind the hit song, “Forget Me Nots.” 
“Having her breathe so much life into my music,” Ayoni said, is what made “Divine” the track we hear today. 
When Rushen heard the track’s original demo, she told Ayoni that she didn’t know what she wanted from the drums, she didn’t know what she wanted her audience to feel and she didn’t know how they would dance to it.
Ayoni was devastated and stressed by the critique, but she described it as one of the experiences that made the production — and herself as an artist — better. She learned to put ego aside and serve the music, the process and the craft — and yes, she refined the drums. 
Rushen is not the only Trojan affiliate who aided in Ayoni’s metamorphosis as an artist. Artists like Bran Movay, UMI and Mato Wayuhi were some of the first she was introduced to at USC who also inspired and pushed her craft. 
“USC is a community of people where authenticity is so important … being yourself means there is room for everyone,” Ayoni said. “That inspiration I was constantly drawing from just being around people elevated the craft to new heights.”
Essential to Ayoni’s relationships to the USC creative community, her upcoming single “Malibu” and her EP “Iridescent” is her photographer and creative director Caleb Griffin, a senior in the Roski School of Art and Design’s fine arts program. 
Ayoni emphasizes the importance of making her music ethereal. She wants her music to take listener’s to another world and credits Griffin with advancing her vision through cover art. 
“The beautiful thing about his art is the fact that it brings you there, it gives you enough context to know you are not here,” Ayoni said. 
When reflecting on their creative process, Griffin recalls a conversation between the two where she described her music as ancient and almost hymnal. 
And when creating with her, he is constantly reminded that things in this other world, the one where she wants her music to take her listeners “are gonna look, are gonna feel different,” he says. Divine, if you will. 
With Ayoni’s genre-defying attitude in mind, one of the best ways to describe her music would be “Afrofuturistic,” (see the music of Parliament-Funkadelic or Janelle Monáe, the novels of Octavia Butler or the canvas of Jean-Michel Basquiat for reference). 
Thematically and sonically, she’s singing about a love people who look like her don’t usually get. And the unreleased tracks she shared take you to a different world. Afrofuturism envisions Black futures through Afro Diasporic experiences, an inherently political message that fits the stylings of an artist who sees her art as political and pushes herself to bring it to its fullest potential. 
“Now that I exist as an artist, how can I use my music to change the world and better the world?” Ayoni said. “It doesn’t have to be from a preachy place, but how can I do that just from being my most authentic self?”
Her relationship to politics in her work expands beyond who the lyrics touch or inspire but also has roots in her upbringing. 
When asked how her parents perceived the love she had for music at an early age, Ayoni described them as being “real” in terms of potential career paths for their daughter. 
Ayoni said Barbados, where she was born, is a place where STEM career paths are encouraged due to the lifestyle they guaranteed in formerly colonized places like her home country — a sentiment many first-generation creatives know all too well. 
Not everyone has the privilege to create and stand in their truth artistically like Ayoni or fellow Barbadian singer Rihanna do. In Ayoni’s eyes, the ability to be authentic and transcend the lasting effects of colonization is political. 
But regardless of cultural expectations and her parents’ initial hesitation, her love and pursuit of music could not be suppressed. 
The throughline in Ayoni’s artistry is its proximity to divinity. From early childhood, she has been obsessed with “leading someone into a divine experience” through music. At a young age, she watched her dad lead a church rehearsal, calling it one of her first moments of consciousness with music.
Eventually, her parents realized the depth of her talent and the love for music that moment had sparked, calling it a “gift from God.” Her music was now something to be taken seriously. 
From being born in Barbados to moving to Miami during her early childhood, then Singapore for 18 months, California for six years and finally Jakarta for some of her high school years, her musical taste grew, developed and became defined by her surroundings. 
Next for Ayoni is a single titled “Malibu,” which features a thematic and sonic departure from her debut. It’s not the upbeat, self-affirming ballad “Divine”  is, but since it is Ayoni’s, it’s unique and honest. 
“I wanted to start my career out being very intentional about the first messages people received,” Ayoni said. 
Her goal with “Divine,” Malibu” and “Iridescent” is to show that it’s possible to change the norms and narratives of not only genre but the ways in which artists tell stories and truths through music. 
“By the time people make it through my project,” Ayoni said, “they’ll understand that, for me as an artist, genre is not real.”

On Sunday night, Maggie Rogers graced the GRAMMY Museum in L.A. Live with an intimate conversation and performance. 
The near two-hour program provided Rogers’ fans an open, honest space to connect with everything she has to offer, from insights on her music-making process to a stripped-down performance of her song “Alaska.”
The 25-year-old NYU alumna and self-proclaimed “pop star” (humorously and ironically, of course) spoke about her songwriting from a genuine vulnerability that brews the kind of confidence that arrogant people can only dream of having. 
With her career notoriously launching from a YouTube video of Pharrell reacting to her piece, Rogers spoke about finding her voice and curating her own space without too much input from others. In other words, her evening at the GRAMMY Museum cleared up any confusion: What Rogers puts into the world, Rogers creates. And she puts her whole heart into it.
Toward the end of the program, Rogers performed the song from the infamous Pharrell video, “Alaska.” But, rather than playing with all the layered production, she played it as she wrote it in her dorm room: With nothing but her voice and a guitar. A classic singer-songwriter, Rogers explained that her rhythm and her physical voice took her longer to find than the tone and art she wanted to create.
Bringing out her guitarist for “Burning,” “Say It,” and “Light On,” Maggie was able to immerse herself fully in her lyrics. Rogers, ever the detail oriented creator, clarified earlier in the night that songwriting to her is always more about the lyrics. 
“It’s just as much about the levels of the bass that transcend the song … that share the message and create the story you’re trying to tell,” Rogers said.
Rogers dances as if the music is inside her. Which, it kind of is. Her dancing has become a language to her team, she explains. When in the studio, if she moves her elbow a certain way when dancing, it signals to the producer that she feels a snare drum on that beat.
Both her conversation and her performance make one thing clear: Rogers is an artist for the streaming era. In a new wave of music, she aims to be an amalgamation of any and every genre that has existed before her. Tying her love of dance and punk music from her time in New York to her banjo-playing folk roots, she states her desire to make music that you can “dance to while crying.”
Rogers’ glaring honesty is representative of many artists today. Billie Eilish, Lizzo and Mumford & Sons (all artists Rogers considers industry peers as well as personal friends) shine when vulnerable. 
“When telling a story to a friend, your mom or your therapist, you have a specific story,” Rogers said. “But you can’t lie when singing.”
Rogers’ night at the Museum illustrated her life. Music is clearly a huge part of everything she stands for, and she’s protective of the music she creates. 
Deliberate and thoughtful, she puts it like this: She’s just a recent college grad acclimating to a new career. And, like every other young new member of the workforce, she wants to prove herself and do her job well.
Rogers will perform Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Greek Theatre.
