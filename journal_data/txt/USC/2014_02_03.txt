Tomorrow marks one of the single most hectic days on the sports calendar — National Signing Day. If a petition does not yet exist to make this day a national holiday in the United States, then we’ve failed as a society. If the United States’ 21st century obsession with reality television is any indication, then giving the people this day off from their responsibilities would make ESPN’s round-the-clock coverage of signing day the top-rated television program of the year.
Signing day is made for TV and has everything you would ever want in a reality show — drama, betrayal, suspense, you name it — mixed with the fervor of the nation’s most popular sport. Put some cameras, microphones and a few hats in front of a prized recruit and just watch the madness unfold.
There will be the usual diva-like behavior from dozens of prospects who are deemed “blue chip” or “can’t miss” — many of whom will amount to very little in their college careers. But that doesn’t mean their announcements aren’t worth watching — never underestimate the showmanship of a high school senior. Nor will it prevent analysts from determining NSD winners and losers months before any of the players ever play a snap of college football.
Though watching the commitments come in for your favorite school is exciting and tantalizing, the bottom line is that it’s just way too early to tell whether or not a recruiting class will be successful. Take a look at USC’s past few classes to see just how misguided the early reactions were at the time.
In 2010, former head coach Lane Kiffin’s first season, the Trojans’ class ranked No. 7 in the nation, according to ESPN. Five of USC’s top-10 commits that season were wide receiver Markeith Ambles, running back D.J. Morgan, wide receiver Kyle Prater, quarterback Jesse Scroggins and running back Dillon Baxter. All but one from that group transferred out of the school, and Morgan has yet to make a meaningful impact in his career.
In 2011, USC brought in the No. 4 class in the country, headlined by top-ranked wide receiver George Farmer and top-ranked offensive guard Cyrus Hobbi. Neither have seen regular playing time for the Trojans. The same can be said for two of USC’s other top-five commits (according to ESPN) — quarterback Max Wittek (who announced his intent to transfer last week) and wide receiver Victor Blackwell.
It’s still a little too soon to judge the 2012 and 2013 classes, as those players just completed their freshman and sophomore seasons. The standout from 2012 is sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams, who was an All-American last season and seems destined to be a first-round pick in next year’s NFL Draft. Sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor looks like a star in the making, and sophomore cornerback Kevon Seymour, as well as sophomore offensive lineman Max Tuerk, were starters last season. Unheralded transfers such as senior Morgan Breslin and redshirt junior Josh Shaw ended up being key contributors right away, giving this class a good boost.
Many of the top players from the 2013 class seized their opportunities last season. Freshman safety Su’a Cravens has been a starter from day one and tied for second on the team with four interceptions. Many of his classmates also made an impact right away. Wide receiver Darreus Rogers is USC’s second-leading receiver returning next season, and running backs Justin Davis and Ty Isaac showed tons of promise in USC’s crowded yet talented backfield.
Which leads me to my point — that it’s silly to get overly excited or disappointed by whatever will happen tomorrow. Players who generate celebration amongst a fanbase will end up not panning out. Others who are ranked at the bottom of the list will become stars who lead the team in a season or two.
Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard of the 2010 class were both listed as three-star recruits by Scout.com and didn’t have defined positions. Both became three-year starters and earned all-conference honors, and Pullard will have a chance to add to that impressive resume’ next year in his fifth and final season.
Redshirt junior Quarterback Cody Kessler was also a three-star recruit and considered USC’s “other” quarterback in the Class of 2011 behind the much more highly touted Wittek. Three years later, Kessler has a firm grasp on the starting job after leading the team to a gutsy 10-win season and throwing for nearly 3,000 yards, while Wittek is on his way to transferring to another program.
Yes, Marqise Lee was ranked in the ESPN Top 150 rankings, but most projected him as a defensive back, and much more attention was given to Lee’s high school teammate Farmer. Lee ended up on the offensive side of the ball and became one of the best receivers in conference history.
USC’s 2014 class currently ranks No. 34 in the nation, and right now that means just about nothing. Neither Oregon nor Stanford has had a single top-10 class in the last five years. The ability to cultivate an 18-year-old’s raw talent and put them in the best position to succeed is far more important than racking up the most star ratings.
So when keeping up to speed on all the happenings of NSD tomorrow, tune in for the pageantry and angry responses from spurned fans on Twitter rather than the class rankings, because, as you’ll find out once the 2014 season kicks off, the true impact from the most recent NSD is a couple of years away from truly being felt.

With tomorrow’s National Signing Day fast approaching, Daily Trojan sports columnists Will Laws, Nick Selbe, Jacob Freedman, Darian Nourian, Jake Davidson and Nick Burton discussed the state of USC football’s 2014 recruiting class.
Immediate impact · Offensive tackle Kevin Graf’s graduation will open up a hole on the offensive line that could be filled by a freshman. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
Q: How would you grade USC’s recruiting class so far?
Laws: C+. But that’s not exactly Sarkisian’s fault. Former coach Lane Kiffin hadn’t secured many recruits before his dismissal, and USC currently ranks No. 34 on Rivals’ team recruiting class rankings. But they are No. 11 in terms of average stars per recruit, so if the Trojans can reel in a few more big names on National Signing Day, this mark can definitely improve.
Selbe: B. The Trojans have just two recruits ranked in ESPN’s Top 100 rankings, with tight end Bryce Dixon and offensive lineman Viane Talamaivao coming in at No. 89 and No. 96, respectively, which is slightly underwhelming by USC standards. Four other players rank in the ESPN Top 300, and USC has emphasized one of its biggest areas of weakness — offensive line, with four offensive linemen already committed. This grade could receive a huge boost depending on the decisions of USC’s three most coveted remaining targets- — cornerback Adoree’ Jackson (No. 9 in ESPN Top 100), athlete John “Juju” Smith (No. 24) and offensive guard Damien Mama (No. 67).
 
Q: Which of USC’s five early enrollees do you see making the biggest impact next season?
Nourian: The early enrollee that really stands out to me is four-star offensive lineman Toa Lobendahn out of La Habra, Calif. With an already thin offensive line following the departure of right tackle Kevin Graf and center Marcus Martin to the NFL draft, it looks like Sarkisian will be forced to start at least one true freshman up front.
Selbe: Claudeson Pelon. At 6-foot-5 and 280 lbs., Pelon has the size necessary to play alongside USC’s already talented defensive line. The Trojans are very deep at defensive end, but the defensive tackle position remains largely inexperienced. Pelon was ranked as the No. 20 Junior College Player in the United States by ESPN and was one of the most sought-after players in the state of Florida. Given USC’s recent success with players from the Sunshine State, it wouldn’t surprise me if Pelon became a star sooner rather than later.
 
Q: How do you think the Sarkisian hire has affected recruiting this year?
Davidson: I think it has been a tremendous plus. USC would have a nationally ranked class with any coach but some of the guys Sarkisian has gotten to commit have been huge for the Trojans. Jonathan Lockett is a guy who can play right away and develop into a man-to-man shutdown cornerback. That’s a major upgrade for the defense. Getting Bryce Dixon reinforced USC’s connections with Saint Bonaventure, a historically dominant high school program in Ventura County and gave Sarkisian a dynamic tight end. Though Dixon isn’t as big as Austin Seferian-Jenkins was at Washington, his natural fluidity will pay major dividends moving forward.
Freedman: Hurt it. Hate it or not, Kiffin was one hell of a recruiter. Sarkisian and his staff were brought in late in the game and have had to juggle between taking offers off the table given by the previous regime and going on the road to get talent for 2014. This class still lacks an offensive difference-maker (Juju Smith would fix that) or a traditional run-stuffing defender.
 
Q: What is the biggest position Sarkisian needs to recruit?
Freedman: Wide receiver. USC has one in the class so far with Rahshead Johnson, but another couldn’t hurt. Just look at 2013: Every wide receiver on the roster was injured or at least banged up at some point of the season. You can never have enough skilled players available considering their chances of injury.
Laws: The Trojans will need to replenish their linebacking corps very soon. USC doesn’t have any listed in their 2014 class yet, though four-star defensive end Olajuwon Tucker (6-foot-4, 225 lbs.) might be a better fit at linebacker in defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s 4-3 scheme. Still, USC doesn’t seem to be in the mix for any elite LB recruits this late in the game -— and that could become a problem in the future.
 
Q: Who would be the biggest recruit USC could still sign?
Davidson: The obvious answer is Adoree’ Jackson but that might discount how important Damien Mama could be for the Trojans. Mama is a guy who could anchor the line for two or three years, in the mold of Matt Kalil. Even if he goes on a mission, he is still a major pickup.
Nourian: Adoree’ Jackson would be a huge pick up for the Trojans come National Signing Day. The five-star cornerback out of Gardena, Calif. is the No. 9-ranked recruit in the ESPN 300 and is the No. 1 prospect in the state of California. Jackson sports tremendous speed on the outside, running a 4.48 official 40-yard dash, and he would be a big upgrade for USC at the cornerback position, which seemed to be in doubt at times last season. He is going to be a tough get, though, as Jackson’s offer sheet goes on and on with offers from the nation’s top programs including national champion Florida State, Oklahoma and other Pac-12 teams such as Oregon, Arizona State and crosstown rival UCLA.
 
Q: Did USC address all of its areas of need in this recruiting class?
Selbe: At this point, I would say yes. The Trojans have a bevy of commits on the both lines, and have at least two commits in the secondary with possibly more on the way. Sarkisian got a commitment from the No. 1 tight end in Dixon, which should help after the departure of Xavier Grimble. The one position that appears to be lacking in this class is wide receiver, with just one commitment so far in Rahshead Johnson, but this might not be that big of an issue next season.

The fourth-ranked USC men’s tennis team had an impressive showing at last weekend’s Pac-12/SEC Showdown, sweeping No. 3 Georgia and No. 11 Florida. Leading the way was the Trojans’ captain and top singles player Ray Sarmiento, who didn’t drop a single set on his way to two singles victories.
Ace in the hole · Captain Ray Sarmiento helped the Trojans win two national championships during his first two years. After faltering in last year’s NCAA quarterfinals, the senior hopes to lead the Trojans back to the top. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Daily Trojan managing editor Euno Lee sat down with Sarmiento yesterday to discuss his individual and team successes.
 
DT: How do you feel about this season and this year’s team?
Sarmiento: We had a great fall to begin with, and I think that set up the good start we had this weekend, but overall I think our team is looking good. We have a really deep team and everyone’s competing for a spot and that brings up the intensity in the practice. Throughout the year I think our goal is to take every day and give it our best. Not really worrying about the results right now, but more toward the end of May.
 
DT: Coach [Peter Smith] was saying [Sunday] that you made a lot of changes. What are some of those changes to you, and when did this happen?
Sarmiento: That’s a big thing coming from Big Pete [Smith]. I guess it’s a mindset. Since it’s my last year, my mindset’s a little different. I’m taking things more professionally. I try to do my best to lead by example. Stevie [Steve Johnson] and D Nguyen [Daniel Nguyen] were the past leaders and I’ve learned a lot from them, so that’s helped a lot.
 
DT: How about on the court? You were saying you stay in the points more.
Sarmiento: I think maybe before I was trying to close out the points too early, and trying to finish off the points where I didn’t really have the shot to. Now I’m working the points and developing the points longer and getting that absolute short ball and making it certain that I win the point. That comes from Coach, who stresses that.
 
DT: What’s the difference between playing aggressive, like you did last year, and this new game?
Sarmiento: I still want to be aggressive and approach the net and hit aggressive shots. I’m still aggressive, but I’m waiting on that short ball instead of hitting the winner when I’m 10 feet behind the baseline.
 
DT: Are you thinking of playing professionally?
Sarmiento: Yeah, that’s the goal. I want to give it my best and give it a shot. I don’t want to leave anything short, I just want to give it my all this year and the years after this.
 
DT: You played on NCAA championship teams your freshman and sophomore years. After what happened last year, your junior year [when the Trojans were knocked out during the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament], what will it mean to go back this year and pull out another NCAA title? Could this championship mean more than the first two?
Sarmiento: That’s a tough one. I guess the last one would be the sweetest. It’s my last year and I want to finish strong. Every single one was special. My freshman and sophomore year, it was an amazing feeling and I definitely want to experience that again.
 
DT: Last year against UCLA you had [Dennis Novikov] giving you a lot of trouble with big serves. Did you work in the offseason as far as trying to figure out how to even out those big serves that come off the ground?
Sarmiento: It was about reading big serves and adjusting to it. When I played Dennis, I felt like that time I was just standing in the same spot every time. I didn’t adjust accordingly, so that made a big difference. I felt like I was crowding the ball, and I didn’t give enough space so that was the main difference. It’s all about reading the opponent’s serves. I think it all comes instinctively. I definitely work on it in practice, but I don’t want to worry too much about it in matches. It’s more about imposing the strategy of my game than it is positioning.
 
DT: Going off of that, you know tennis is a game that doesn’t tell you much with just a score. There are always different ways to win a game. For Ray Sarmiento, what is the “best way” to win?
Sarmiento: Definitely developing the points and looking to get in. Moving my opponent around and knocking off that easy volley. Playing efficiently and using my quickness. I try to play fast. Playing heavy is a safer shot … but I try to do a little bit of both.
 
DT: What do you think is the biggest misconception about college tennis?
Sarmiento: I think for these [junior 18-and-under tennis players] coming up, they think that college tennis isn’t a high level of tennis. They think when they go to college tennis that their aspirations of going pro are down the drain, but I think college tennis is the best way to get to that next level. A lot of these juniors want to just skip a step and go to the next level and they get stuck and they get burnt out easier on tours. It develops you not only as a tennis player, but as a person. You get a great education, and you couldn’t ask for a better way to develop as a person. I feel like I’ve grown so much these past four years, and it’s helped me a lot.

It’s Friday night, and you find yourself wondering if there’s anything happening on The Row. Rather than shoot some texts and ask around, just open GreekLink — the new app that organizes all social events in the Greek community.
Freaks and Greeks · Noah Johnson launched his new app GreekLink, which allows Greek students to post public events – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
GreekLink was founded by USC sophomore Noah Johnson and his childhood friend, Ari Gootnick, who attends the University of Texas, Austin.
“The app allows sororities and fraternities to post public events just to USC, just to the Greek community or just to their own organization,” Johnson said. “Whether that be a philanthropy event that all of USC can attend or a party that’s just for Greek members, you decide who you want to see each event.”
Anyone can download the iPhone application for free and create a profile, but it serves as a tool not only for the public but also for chapters to contact their members more efficiently.
“A fraternity can send a chapter meeting, which would only go to that private organization … and that’ll get sent as a push notification to everyone on their phone, instead of traditional email, which right now most sororities and fraternities are using,” Johnson said. “You have to check your email, it’s a little less organized, and they’re sometimes not as efficient. [GreekLink] sends a notification, kind of like a text message, to everyone’s phone and gets the point across a little easier.”
The business-minded pair began working on the app early last summer, when both Johnson and Gootnick noticed a lack of communication hindering both of their respective campuses.
“I didn’t know what was going on in other sororities and fraternities, and they kind of felt that there at UT,” Johnson, who is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, said. “Ari basically came back and brought up this idea, and I noticed this lack of communication in my fraternity and Greek life as a whole, and we kind of just moved from there.”
The process of creating an app is a long one: It took about seven or eight months for Johnson and Gootnick, from coming up with the concept to outsourcing the project to be engineered.
“Ari and I are really into the business side and came up with the initial idea,” Johnson said. “We made the initial design, and then we had a team of people in the Ukraine actually code the app for us. That was a pretty long process and there were definitely some cultural boundaries that made it a little more difficult, but we pretty much mapped out the essential design of what we wanted the app to look like and what features we wanted, and then gave that to developers in the Ukraine.”
Despite only launching in mid-January, Johnson said the app already has more than 2,000 USC student users, and almost every Greek fraternity or sorority is registered on GreekLink, a feat that he attributes to his own social network.
“I went through my friends and got reps in each fraternity and sorority,” Johnson said. “From there, I sent out emails and talked to chapter meetings about the app. I set up a table and had fliers and bottle openers that I passed out to people right on University Avenue, to kind of just spread the word. A lot of it was just word of mouth.”
From what he’s been hearing, Johnson said reception of the app has been positive, primarily because there’s nothing else like it on the market.
“There was really no other way to figure out what was going on in another house,” Johnson said. “Now, people are like, ‘Oh, I had no idea that this fraternity or this sorority was having an invite or a party on that day.’ People are really excited about it. But we’re definitely open to feedback. People are coming up to us with cool features that they want to add and things they would like to see.”
Even though Greek life is known for playing a more significant role here at USC than at the average university, Johnson said he anticipates the app to be as much of a success at other campuses as it is here.
“The heavy influence of Greek life has a great impact has helped our app catch on a little bit quicker, and UT seems to be growing at the exact same rate and they obviously have a really big Greek influence, as well,” Johnson said. “But I think any school could utilize it — it creates a little more organization in the Greek system.”
Johnson, a Marshall student, and Gootnick, an advertising major, have roots in the business world from a as far back as when they were teenagers.
“I’ve always been really interested in entrepreneurship and the startup culture, and me and Ari actually had a DJ business in high school, so that’s how we know each other — we grew up together,” Johnson said.
From the DJ business to this seemingly ever-growing app, Johnson said their ultimate goal is to expand GreekLink across the country.
“Hopefully it goes to every Greek system in the U.S. — that’s our dream,” Johnson said. “We’re getting a lot of interest already from colleges outside of UT and USC. We’re hoping to expand pretty quickly — if not this semester — and probably 20 plus schools by next fall.”

I didn’t realize how close Chinatown was to USC until I started training for my first marathon last year. One day, on an out-and-back run past Downtown Los Angeles, I accidentally stumbled upon the embellished dragon gateway that marks the entrance.
So this was Chinatown.
I’d been before. In third grade, my class took a field trip to Chinatown. We went on a cultural walking tour. I bought a cheap decorated fan and a Sailor Moon address book that is still in a drawer, somewhere.
I remember going back with my temple’s Haverim group for a lunch which consisted of courses of steaming dishes that I — a picky eater whose diet at the time consisted primarily of grilled cheese — mostly abstained from.
And there were other visits which blurred together. Each of those trips centered on food in some way. As I grew older, my palate expanded past pre-sliced cheddar cheese.
But I’d never gone before, just to go.
On my run, I took in the sights, the smells, the different terrain (you could see grassy hills from the sidewalk, a sight for sore eyes accustomed to cement and more cement). There were places I remember dogmarking in my mind to visit later (Phoenix Bakery, which boasts being the oldest and largest bakery in Chinatown, stands out). But I never ended up making those trips. Other things to do, places to see.
If I’m being honest, though, I think one of the reasons I never made it back was because I wasn’t sure how to approach Chinatown on a non-superficial level. The neighborhood struck me as interesting and unexpected — certainly a change of pace from Downtown Los Angeles. The historic architecture, the fragrant apothecaries and the colorful storefronts gave the area its own unique feel. But I didn’t know how to access Chinatown. On my run, I couldn’t help but notice that the people around me were a mix of insiders and blatant tourists. Even just passing through, I felt like the latter.
It’s bothered me that I haven’t really made an effort to get to know Chinatown. I’ve read about it in Lisa See’s novels that detail the early history of the area. I’ve seen it on film, in Chinatown and Rush Hour. And when I was the lifestyle editor for the Daily Trojan, I edited articles about its burgeoning nightlife and cultural scene. But I’ve never gotten to know it on my own.
Since this past weekend was Chinese New Year, otherwise known as the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, I took another run down to Chinatown to catch the 115th Golden Dragon Parade on Saturday.
It was the year of the horse, and people crowded the streets to watch the procession. It was a sight. Bright confetti decorated the pavement, as people pulled party poppers that burst in the air like colorful gunshots.
It was a strange mix of commercial and authentic. Around me, outdoor vendors sold caricatures of East Asian culture (“Straw hats for $5, fans: three for $10”). But adjacent to the vendors, authentic fish markets were open for business — tilapia, lobster and silver carp staring back from glass cases, mouths open, whiskers quivering.
It felt like I was experiencing two different Chinatowns. One moment, I’d see a multi-generational family exchanging red envelopes as they sat on a bench to watch the parade. Then a few feet away, there’d be a mother taking a picture of a little girl dolled up in a light pink kimono and shiny cowboy boots, with takeout food chopsticks stuck in her hair.
When I got hungry, I purchased a savory egg and tomato dish from one of the storefronts. I ate it slowly as I soaked in the atmosphere.
There was an undeniable energy to the day. The streets were packed with a strong representation of different cultural groups. There was so much to take in that I found myself constantly looking around trying to experience everything. I was surprised to see such a strong showing from the Latino community on the sideline and in the procession until I remembered that Olvera Street is geographically adjacent.
As I continued to watch the parade, though, I felt like I did on my run last year — intrigued but still somewhat detached.
The tomato and egg dish sat in my stomach, warm and authentic. Maybe I’m looking for something that isn’t there. But I think I just haven’t been looking hard enough. 
Chinatown’s cultural center offers walking tours the first Saturday of the month. I’m going to go next month. Maybe by walking in Chinatown, rather than running through it next time, I’ll see it from a different perspective.

“When I was a student, I knew I wanted to tell stories for a living, but I wasn’t exactly sure how that would pan out,” said USC alumna Heather Demetrios. Demetrios would have never guessed that People magazine’s cover of “Kate Gosselin + 8” would inspire her debut novel, Something Real, which hits shelves today.

“I looked at these kids and I thought, ‘What will it be like for them when they’re teenagers?’” Demetrios said. “Those kids can look forward to a life where everyone knows about their parents’ horrible divorce and where they can basically download their childhood.”
Something Real follows the story of 17-year-old Bonnie, who is thrust back into the limelight when Baker’s Dozen, the reality show about her family, is renewed. Demetrios’ novel has already won the 2012 PEN New England Susan P. Bloom Discovery Award.
A Los Angeles native, Demetrios attended high school in Fresno, Calif., before studying theatre at USC. Now writing from Brooklyn, NY, Demetrios still draws on California and the entertainment culture of Los Angeles as an influence.
Demetrios’ favorite book that she has written so far, A Geography of Us, will arrives in bookstores in the winter of 2015. The novel centers around art school-bound Skyler, who meets Josh, a man dreaming of becoming a marine, but is unable to after being injured in Afghanistan.
Though her works explore diverse genres, the subject matter all fits within her theme of “teens that are trying to break out of some kind of hostile situation,” Demetrios said.
Demetrios started writing seriously when she was teaching in South Korea, but she recalls reading the Harry Potter series and dismissing it. She said she didn’t get the appeal of young adult literature — that is, until she tried writing.
“It’s like I fell in love with reading all over again,” Demetrios said.
Her biggest inspiration is still reading, though she also makes music playlists and collages for all her books to switch it up between long keyboard typing sessions.
Demetrios suggests that aspiring YA writers read all  genres, but especially YA literature. Some of her favorite authors are E. Lockhart, John Green and Laini Taylor. Demetrios also said she reads an abundance of poetry for inspiration.
Demetrios looks for inspiration from her research. While writing Something Real, Demetrios watched Cinema Verite, an HBO film about the production of the United States’ earliest examples of reality television, and read the autobiography of the mother in said television show, Pat Loud.
Even though Demetrios said she had fun writing Something Real she also notes that writing for YA is fraught with the same challenges as adult literature, and that there’s a sense of loyalty she has to her readers.
“I feel like I have a responsibility to teen readers, because that’s who’s being aggressively marketed to for my books,” Demetrios said. “So I’m very aware … if someone in my book has sex, I have to mention a condom, or birth control, or something like that.”
Despite the recent commercialization of the young adult demographic — with books such as The Hunger Games, Twilight, Harry Potter and the upcoming Divergent series made into blockbuster franchises — Demetrios said she advises aspiring writers not to chase trends or “write what’s on the bookshelf.”
Young adult literature, however, is a genre that is getting darker language-wise as well as being more honest about teen sex.
“College-age students are right in the YA sweet spot,” Demetrios said.
“Everybody’s reading [YA] — even my mother-in-law reads YA,” Demetrios said. “I love the idea that for some of my audience, reading my book could actually change their life. When you’re a young person … books inspire your career choices and your lifestyle choices … a book could actually change your life. Whereas when you’re older, it can, but you start to get a lot more settled into your identity … It’s a great responsibility and a great opportunity.”
 
Something Real is available as of Tuesday in stores and online.

London-based band Bombay Bicycle Club released its fourth album So Long See You Tomorrow Monday on iTunes. This indie album flirts with multiple genres, not unlike the rest of the music produced by the rapidly-evolving band.
Design by Christina Ellis
Bombay Bicycle Club, originally formed by 15-year-olds Jack Steadman, Jamie MacColl and Suren de Saram — now the lead singer, guitarist and drummer, respectively — got its first big break in 2006, when the band won Virgin Mobile’s “Road to V” contest. The contest gave the band the opening slot in the 2006 V Festival in Chelmsford, London.
The band quickly produced their first EP, titled The Boy I Used to Be, which was released in February of 2007 on its own record label and garnered the band much respect in London’s music scene. From there, the band continued its upward climb and has since gone on three headline tours and released three more albums, the most recent of which included the hit single “How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep.”
Throughout Bombay Bicycle Club’s career, as is exemplified on its latest album So Long, See You Tomorrow, the band has successfully avoided conforming to today’s boy band standard. Bombay Bicycle Club dipped its toes into genres ranging from folk to rock and everything in between while the band were getting their start, not honing their predominantly indie-rock style until 2011’s A Different Kind of Fix. It was A Different Kind of Fix that made it clear to audiences everywhere that Bombay Bicycle Club was marching to the beat of its own drum — and doing so with crowd-pleasing ease and skill. So Long, See You Tomorrow deftly and expertly combines Bollywood, Western, dance and indie music into a record further off the beaten path than the music world has seen in a very long time.
Steadman supposedly traveled to India, Tokyo, Holland and Turkey collecting inspiration for So Long, See you Tomorrow, and the international influence is prevalent, especially in songs such as “Carry Me,” “Feel” and “Overdone.” These three songs sound a little haphazard upon first listen, but the passion with which Steadman sings and with which they are presented make them easy to love.
“Overdone” is the perfect lead-in to the album. Its story is similar to Bombay Bicycle Club’s, beginning with a lovely, though tender and sedate, string-dominated intro. Then, like the band’s discography, it begins to pick up speed, rolling cheerfully into a lively tune with clear Bollywood influence, setting the pace for the rest of the album.
The second track and first duet, “It’s Alright Now,” combines a pulsing, dance-type rhythm with intense percussion and Lucy Rose’s sweet, innocent vocals to create a unique and alluring song. The edgy rhythm that de Saram creates on the drums starts out slowly and is almost intimidating before it rolls into an electronic and irresistible dance-worthy cadence.
Most songs on the 10-piece album are demure, not totally emotionless, but more concerned with style than evoking passion. “Luna,” however, utilizes the vocal forte of English up-and-coming singer Rae Morris to incorporate emotion and depth into a beautiful and poignant track.
“Home By Now” begins with yet another unusual mix of rhythms, managing to create a sound that is both sultry and playful using a frisky guitar part, subtle, yet powerful drums and the hint of a harp. The rest of the song brings together the familiar tinkling piano found in Bombay Bicycle Club’s older tunes and crisp, enunciated beats to create another multifaceted and unexpected song.
For a band known for its guitar-led songs, which have always been incredibly produced, “Eyes Off You” is an interesting, piano-led choice. Smack in the middle of the album, “Eyes Off You” serves as a melancholy damper placed on an otherwise upbeat record. The good intentions of the worldly influence and piano are there, but the track does not do the album justice.
So Long, See You Tomorrow uses Steadman’s impressive vocals to Bombay Bicycle Club’s advantage in a way they haven’t been used before. Along with plenty of international influence, the album tests the waters of yet another new genre for the band by creating a joyful, eclectic album that makes its listeners want to get up and dance.
 
So Long, See You Tomorrow is available as of Monday on iTunes.

When one thinks of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, images of polar bears and red-faced Santa Clauses with glass bottles of carbonated beverages come to mind. These two companies are infamous for their delicious and consistent products dating back to the 1800s. Yet, during this year’s Super Bowl, Fox pulled an advertisement for SodaStream featuring actress Scarlett Johansson because it mentioned two major Super Bowl sponsors, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
Fox assumed that Coke and Pepsi would have problems with the SodaStream advertisement because of the ad’s depiction of SodaStream as a healthier alternative to most sodas. Johansson even ends the advertisement with, “Sorry, Coke and Pepsi.” This isn’t the first time SodaStream’s advertisement was excluded from Super Bowl coverage. Last year, their advertisement used Coke and Pepsi trucks to depict how many bottles are wasted at the hands of their competitors, causing it to be pulled yet again.
Fox shouldn’t be in the business of screening natural competition between rival companies. To think that Coke and Pepsi, two of the United States’ most popular beverages, would suddenly become unpopular due to one competitor’s jab is completely unrealistic. Both trademarks have a history that SodaStream has yet to even possibly come close to — let alone surpass.
If anything, banning the commercial only enticed viewers to watch it online. SodaStream promoted the uncensored version online, garnering more than 10 million views. Even the hashtag #sorrycokeandpepsi circulated on the web.
Furthermore, Fox’s rationale for omitting the full version of the advertisement is misplaced. Rather than worry about competition, it would make more sense for Fox to be concerned with advertising a company involved in human rights violations. The Israeli-owned SodaStream recently came under fire by humanitarian organization Oxfam International and others for its controversial operation of its facility within the West Bank of the Palestinian territories.
“Oxfam believes that businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements, further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law,” the company said in a statement regarding SodaStream’s involvement in the foreign controversy.
It makes no sense that Fox would choose to occupy itself with petty issues such as offending sponsors with a one-line zinger when there are more serious political issues surrounding these advertisements.
Regardless, censoring an advertisement for calling out its rivals isn’t just silly, but completely antithetical to the purpose of the advertisement in the first place. Companies such as Pepsi and SodaStream don’t spend millions of dollars on an overpriced 30-second time slot to be friendly to their competitors. The point of advertisements is to highlight your product and resonate with the consumer. For what other reason would we see familiar faces such as Scarlett Johansson’s if not to convince society that we cannot live without these products? SodaStream prides itself on being a healthier, more environmentally friendly alternative to its sugary, calorie-loaded counterparts. To discourage SodaStream from marketing its brand as such is ridiculous, and it’s not Fox’s place to tell them to market their product otherwise.

I am glad FOX pulled the ad, but not for the reason they allegedly pulled it. 
To me it is more about the position stated by Oxfam ““businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements, further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law,” the company said in a statement regarding SodaStream’s involvement in the foreign controversy. –

Though most people use commercial time to refill snacks or browse Instagram, I become mesmerized by the clever catchphrases and celebrity appearances. My affinity for commercials is capitalism at its finest. But I’m not ashamed of it. I wouldn’t have found out about Pillow Pets from anywhere else.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
 
As I type this, Super Bowl XLVIII Sunday is nearing its final minutes. Spoiler alert: the Seahawks creamed the Broncos, though tension ran through the crowd when defensive back Richard Sherman suffered a right ankle injury. Bruno Mars put on an impressive and entertaining show, though it left me nostalgic for Beyoncé’s performance last year. What I mostly noticed, however, is that this year’s game will remind me of past Super Bowls. The most vivid parts of the Super Bowl, as expected, were the commercials.
Each year, watching the Super Bowl on television as a mild sports enthusiast leaves me uninterested to most of the game. I must admit that my knowledge of football is quite limited. Coming from Kansas, my allegiance lies only with the Chiefs. I do, however, enjoy partaking in this traditional , “American” experience. But the fact of the matter is that I won’t remember “that amazing pass” or “that close call.” What I will remember are the commercials: I still watch that Darth Vader Volkswagen commercial from two years ago on a regular basis to put me in a better mood.
The pull these Super Bowl ads have leads me to question how much they detract from the actual game. More than 108 million people watched the Super Bowl last year, according to ESPN. It fell short of the record for the most-watched game ever, but the volume of people watching attracts attention to the multitude of commercials. With so much marketing jam-packed into the game, people lose the ability to filter the products being presented to them. Celebrities from all parts of the industry appear in the commercials, and on top of the performances for the halftime show, the game of football becomes more of a moneymaking machine. Thinking of it that way makes me feel jaded about the whole Super Bowl experience.
On top of that, there were 55 commercials played within the approximate four-hour block, according to Yahoo Finance. Each 30-second spot cost $4 million to show, and each commercial could cost up to $2 million to produce. The average NFL player makes anywhere between $1 million and $1.9 million annually, according to Sports Illustrated. That’s less than the cost of a one-minute spot. Plus, these commercials could be incapable of reaching out to the masses, because of the population that watches the Super Bowl, a good majority of people are not in the market for a new car or watch. Thus, the Super Bowl uses entertainment for entertainment’s sake. It makes the commercial empty and leads me to think that there are better ways to use that space.
One consolation, however, is that some of this year’s commercials were socially conscious. Cheerios produced an advertisement featuring one of the commercial world’s first biracial couples. Bruce Willis represented Honda not for its speedy rides, but for car safety. If the sentiment of commercials is less “purchase me” and more along the lines to push people to make better decisions or shed light on a very real family construction, so much more than a Super Bowl win could be celebrated.
Commercials often make viewers lose sight of the game, using flashy sales tactics as an appeal for audiences. The millions and millions pooled in for commercial production fail to really invite audiences to buy items; instead, the space it takes up leads the Super Bowl to become more of a superficial event. There is, however, one must-see commercial this year — Budweiser’s “Puppy Love” advertisement.
I guess some things are worth the distraction.

Maybe this true for some people; personally, I watched ZERO commercials and I enjoyed the game thoroughly.

Super Bowl Weekend is typically one of the slowest weekends at the box office and this year was no different. Weak new releases, poor weather across the Northeast and South and, of course, the big game, allowed Ride Along to pull off a rare three-peat at No. 1, with $12.03M for the weekend.
While it’s a commendable achievement, it was able to do so because the two new films, That Awkward Moment and Labor Day, barely made a pip. Nonetheless, the Ice Cube-Kevin Hart comedy stands at $92.7M total and should get to $100M by next week.
Both new releases lost to Frozen, which reached $8.93M thanks to a special sing-along re-release. The animated phenomenon, which earned five Annie Awards including Best Feature on Saturday, now sits at $359.61M domestically and is all but guaranteed to overtake Despicable Me 2. Expect it to make a play for $400M when all is said and done.
In third place was That Awkward Moment, a male-centric romantic comedy starring Zac Efron, Michael B. Jordan, and Miles Teller as a set of twenty-somethings dealing with relationships in the modern world. The feature did have some buzz going into it, due mostly to the young stars involved.  Both Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan had breakout turns last year, with Teller starring in The Spectacular Now and Jordan in an award-worthy role in Fruitvale Station. Zac Efron has opened his own films moderately well, maintaining a dedicated fanbase since his turn in the High School Musical franchise.
However, it just couldn’t overcome its vague marketing and terrible reviews, like the 22 percent rating on RottenTomatoes.com. The main criticism seems to be that, while it tried to be subversive, it ended up being trite, even misogynistic. While this shouldn’t hurt the careers of Teller or Jordan (both are up for roles in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot), this won’t do any favors either.
Debuting at #7 was the romance Labor Day, which managed only $5.17M for the weekend, one of the weakest openings for any romance drama ever. This is rather stunning considering the pedigree behind the film. Starring Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet, one of the most acclaimed actresses of her generation, and written and directed by Jason Reitman, the Oscar-nominated director behind Young Adult, Juno, Up in the Air, and Thank You For Smoking, the film appears to have the makings of an Oscar contender.
Paramount had, at one point, scheduled Labor Day for December for awards consideration but abandoned that strategy, delaying it to January. The initial thought was that it was too competitive a time, but the reviews didn’t back it up, with many critics wondering what drew Reitman and the cast to the script in the first place.
If there’s any film that’s been able to succeed on a Super Bowl weekend, it’s typically a romance, or at least something that acts as counter-programming to the Big Game. Last year, zombie flick Warm Bodies had a lively debut, sci-fi thriller Chronicle and horror thriller The Woman in Black both had great debut the year prior, and Dear John had one of the best romantic debuts back in 2010. And Labor Day seemed to be going after the Nicholas Spark niche but just failed to connect with audiences. The involvement of an Oscar-nominated writer-director and an Oscar-winning actress can only go so far if the concept isn’t appealing.
With neither romantic film making an impact, maybe couples decided that staying inside to watch the game was the weekend’s best date option.
