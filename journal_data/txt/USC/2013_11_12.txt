Freshman defender Mandy Freeman was named to the 2013 All Pac-12 First Team, becoming the first player since 2009 to earn a spot on the all-conference first team.
History · Freshman defender Mandy Freeman’s selection to the first team All-Pac-12 marks the first time a USC player has made the team since 2009. – Jasmine Rolle | Daily Trojan
 
The Royal Palm Beach, Fla. native started in all 20 games of her first season with the Women of Troy and had one assist in the season opener. Freeman is also the first freshman to be named to an all-conference team since Amy Rodriguez in 2005.
In addition to this recent accolade, Freeman was named to the Minnesota Gold Classic All-Tournament Team and was chosen as CS360 National Freshman of the Week on Oct. 15.
Freshman forward/midfielder Kayla Mills joins Freeman on the 2013 Pac-12 All-Freshman Team while sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink earned All Pac-12 Honorable Mention.
Mills was also an honoree on the Minnesota Gold Classic All-Tournament Team this season. In her first season as a Trojan, she scored four goals and provided eight assists, good for sixth-most assists in a single season in program history.
Fink, who made the All-Freshman Team last year, finished the season with a pair assists and five goals, two of which were game-winners against Florida Atlantic and Oregon State. Earlier this season, Fink was named to the USD All-Tournament Team.

After kicking off the year on the right foot with two road wins against UC Davis and Fresno State last week, the USC women’s basketball team takes on the San Diego State Aztecs today in its home opener at the Galen Center.
USC (2-0) got its 27th season-opening victory on Friday against Utah State as the team battled back from a second-half deficit to triumph, 64-55.
The Women of Troy were able to carry that momentum into Fresno, where they once again came out on top by a nine-point margin, 63-54.
Neither of these wins, however, came easily for the Women of Troy, as both games were decided in the final minutes. USC performed well down the stretch to prevail.
“I am very proud of our team because we fought through all the difficulties the game presented, finished the game and came away with two road victories, which is not easy to do,” USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said.
In beating Davis and Fresno State, USC was able to avenge two losses from last season.
“These were two tough games, as they presented matchup problems for us, but we grinded it out,” Cooper-Dyke said.
With early success on the road, the Women of Troy have started 2-0 for the first time since the 2005-2006 season, which was also the last time that the program reached the NCAA Tournament.
Senior forward and team captain Cassie Harberts, who recorded her first double-double of the year against Fresno State with 13 points and 12 rebounds, mentioned that the Women of Troy’s two resilient wins came as a result of Cooper-Dyke emphasizing a new mentality for the team.
“We have a much more aggressive mentality in that we never let up or backed down,” Harberts said. “Instead, we fought back and finished the game.”
The team’s focus is now set on San Diego State, which narrowly dropped its season opener on the road against Sacramento State in a 93-89 loss.
In last year’s matchup, the Aztecs handily defeated the Women of Troy 80-46. After avenging last season’s losses, USC will set out to do the same against San Diego State.
“We are mainly just focused on playing the game we know how to play and not beating ourselves,” Harberts said.
In preparation for the Aztecs, the Women of Troy practiced sets against a variety of different defensive schemes that San Diego State could play on Wednesday.
“[San Diego State] plays a lot of different defenses, but we want to be prepared for their zone, man or anything that they throw at us,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We want to be able to execute offensively and defensively and be the best Women of Troy team that we can be.”
Wednesday night’s matchup will also be Cooper-Dyke’s official home coaching debut at Galen Center, which she hopes will develop into a real home-court advantage for the team.
“I am excited to be home and I want us to be able to protect our home court,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Tipoff at the Galen Center is scheduled for 4 p.m.

Two years ago, ESPN’s College GameDay came here for the USC-Stanford game. USC was unranked and on the rise after an early season 21-point loss to Arizona State. Stanford was ranked in the top six nationally, with a vaunted, powerful offensive line and a punishing power attack. This year, GameDay is here again for the USC-Stanford game. USC is on the rise after an early season 21-point loss to Arizona State, and Stanford is ranked in the top five nationally, with one of the most physically imposing and dominant offensive lines in recent memory. Subtract two great quarterbacks, Andrew Luck and Matt Barkley, and one might assume that this game is just a repeat of the 2011 three-overtime epic. To do so, however, would be a mistake.
Yes, Stanford’s season is unfolding in a familiar fashion, one college football fans have grown accustomed to during the course of current head coach David Shaw’s tenure. The Cardinal pound the ball and wear down the other team, using their unique combination of brains and brawn to compensate for a lack of dynamic athletes.
That’s where the similarities end, however, because for USC, this is one of the most bizarre football seasons the school has ever had. Generally, USC’s seasons have played out one of two ways over the program’s illustrious history. Sometimes the team fulfills its immense potential and goes on to play in a Rose Bowl or the national championship, developing into the team that no one wants to play at the end of the year. Or USC flounders as a result of questionable coaching and frustrating play calls. The last two decades have seen both types of seasons. The Trojans were dominant and exciting under Pete Carroll, yet underwhelming and disappointing under Paul Hackett and Lane Kiffin.
The reason this team is so unique is because it has integrated both types of teams in the same season. There was the offensive ineptitude showcased against Washington State and Utah State juxtaposed with the brilliant performances against Oregon State and California. Maybe this improvement is due to Kiffin’s firing, and the fact that coaches are rarely fired that early in the season, but this type of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde switch just doesn’t happen in college football.
It’s not out of the question that USC could still play in the Rose Bowl this year and win 12 games. After that Arizona State loss, no one on the planet believed that was possible with this year’s crew. The real question, though, is how did that drastic turnaround come about?
There are probably a lot of technical reasons why, but I think it’s a lot simpler — the  development of talent. The one hallmark of Trojan teams, both good and bad, has been an abundance of talent. Even in the lean years, you could always count on USC redshirting more four- and five-star recruits than some teams had on their entire roster. This year is no different; it just so happens that under a new regime that refuses to play favorites, the cream of the crop is actually rising to the top.
Want to know the difference between a narrow victory over Utah State, and a dominant performance over Cal? Redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen is finally touching the ball and displaying the talent that was so evident during practice the past two years. The victory was obviously due to more than just one player, but Allen’s performance over the past few games was indicative of a change in philosophy for the Trojans.
After languishing on the bench for years, senior wide receiver De’Von Flournoy is showing fans what his potent combination of strength and size can do to defenders. Junior defensive end J.R. Tavai is now getting the chance to confirm that he was no one-game wonder two years ago against Stanford as he has proven to be a ferocious defender, racking up tackles all over the field.
Many of these players were initially thrust into the spotlight because of injuries to starters ahead of them on the depth chart, but they have seized their opportunity and look to be mainstays in the starting lineup moving forward.
The talent extends beyond these players, and now that the position coaches finally have free reign over their areas of expertise, players are blossoming left and right. From two true freshmen safeties to redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, several Trojans who lacked experience at the start of the year are now coming into their own.
This season really has been unlike any other, and it has underscored how important it is to not only recruit, but also develop talent. Since 2011, Stanford has experienced smooth sailing, while USC has had a rollercoaster ride, complete with plenty of highs and lows.
On Saturday, USC can do what it came so close to accomplishing in 2011 — upset the Cardinal and restore the balance of power in the Pac-12. Achieving that isn’t just important for Saturday, but it might be the defining characteristic that thrusts the Trojans back into the national spotlight for good.

With ESPN’s College GameDay heading back to USC this Saturday for the Trojans’ showdown with the No. 4-ranked Stanford Cardinal, there is plenty of hype surrounding the team that has won three consecutive games, two of them coming on the road.
Questionable · Senior running back Silas Redd’s status for Saturday’s game against Stanford is up in the air after hurting his knee against Cal. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans are finally knocking on the door of the top 25 once again, having received 10 votes in last week’s Associated Press poll, and should they be able to spoil Stanford’s national championship aspirations with a win on Saturday, they would most likely be put back into national relevance.
Players and coaches alike feel that having College GameDay on campus will instill more enthusiasm among the Trojan faithful.
“We want people to get excited again about USC football,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said. “We feel we are on the right track.”
Interim head coach Ed Orgeron also discussed the benefits of having the show on campus before the game.
“I think you can feel the electricity in the air,” Orgeron said. “It will be great for the fans, great for the energy around the stadium, great for recruiting and great for the Trojan Family.”
With all the hype surrounding this game, Orgeron said he expected a great turnout from USC fans.
“It’s important to our players,” Orgeron said. “We’ll play well if there’s one person in the stadium. That’s our mindset. But we work together with the crowd and the band, so it’s a home-field advantage that’s very important to us.”
A Battle in the Trenches 
With this game featuring two of the nation’s best defensive front sevens, this game is sure to be one that is won up front.
“We need to really improve on the line of scrimmage,” Orgeron said. “It will be a line of scrimmage game.”
The Cardinal are coming off a game in which they not only dominated up front against Oregon, but also the time of possession, controlling the ball for a little over 42 minutes.
The majority of their success can be attributed to their ability to hand the ball off to running back Tyler Gaffney, who took an outstanding 45 carries for 157 yards and a touchdown against the Ducks.
“It catches our attention,” Orgeron said of Stanford’s performance against Oregon. “We watched that film, and they’re very good on the defensive front and they’re very well-coached. Our guys respect Stanford, but we also respect what we’re doing and have confidence in what we can do.”
If the Trojans are going to have success against a ground-and-pound Stanford team, they are going to have to contain Gaffney and the power of its offensive line.
“It’s all about us and not about them,” Orgeron said. “We expect a very good Stanford team to show up, and we expect to be very good also.”
The Running Back Show 
Redshirt sophomore tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, freshman tailback Ty Isaac and redshirt sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku got the majority of the carries in practice on Tuesday.
Vainuku received carries at tailback in the event that neither senior Silas Redd nor redshirt sophomore Tre Madden are able to play on Saturday.
Allen excelled in the leading tailback role against Cal after Redd went down. He had another career day, taking just six carries for 135 yards and two touchdowns on the ground, while also adding a receiving touchdown.
Issac did his fair share of work as well, rushing for 87 yards and two touchdowns.
The USC running game will face its greatest test of the season Saturday against the Stanford front seven, which is part of a defense that ranks nationally in the top 20 in nearly all defensive categories.
Injury Report 
Redd and redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer are both listed as questionable for Saturday’s game.
Telfer did practice on Tuesday, and sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams had pads on but did not participate in contact drills.
Williams and redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble are listed as probable for Saturday’s game.
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee also said on Tuesday that he is back to 100 percent and could have fully participated in the last two weeks. Lee said the coaches wanted to take precautions with his left knee, which was originally injured against Arizona State.

USC’s 95-79 win over the Cal State Northridge Matadors did not come as a surprise for new head coach Andy Enfield and his run-and-gun squad, but there was a certain atmosphere and excitement at the Galen Center on Tuesday for this year’s Trojan basketball team that had to have come as a shock for those familiar with past teams.
Off and running · USC senior guard Pe’Shon Howard (10) helped lead a fast-paced Trojan attack in Tuesday’s 95-79 victory over Cal State Northridge at the Galen Center. Howard finished with seven points and two assists. – Chris Marquetti | Daily Trojan
In recent years, USC has been excruciatingly methodical, so Trojan faithful were more than pleased to see an early alley-oop dunk from freshman guard Julian Jacobs and a series of aggressive drives from sophomore guard Chass Bryan. Those types of plays came early and often for USC (1-1) on Tuesday night, and they will only increase in volume and efficiency as the season matures. Even more exciting for some was the newly founded basketball student section, the “Enzone,” which did its best to express disagreements with the referees all game long while wearing matching “Enzone” T-shirts. Still, the victory did not come easily against an experienced Matadors squad, as the Trojans were sloppy at the beginning with eight first-half turnovers and a series of ticky-tack fouls that frequently put Northridge at the foul line, allowing them to remain in contention. The Trojans were also hurt in a major way by a rough start from junior guard Byron Wesley, who made just two of eight shot attempts in the first half. He was still able to get to the free throw line, but in general the Trojans seemed over-anxious to make plays early, and were fortunate to enter the half leading by 11. “I missed a lot of easy shots, but I know when my shot’s not falling, I can do a lot of other things on the court,” Wesley said. He finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds. Out of the halftime break, Enfield saw more of the same, as a few erratic turnovers, including an ill-advised lob from Bryan, allowed the Matadors to cut the deficit to five a few minutes into the second half. USC would eventually settle down, though, thanks in large part to freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic, who made his first five shot attempts, including a pivotal three-pointer that halted a Northridge run early in the second half. Leading by just seven with roughly 10 minutes remaining, the Trojans seemed to finally find their stride, ignited by a three-pointer from senior guard J.T. Terrell that bumped the USC lead back up to double digits. Fans were surprised by the notable absence of Terrell in the starting lineup following his 20-point performance in the season-opening loss against Utah State. Enfield said the decision to sit Terrell out was because of academic reasons. “Playing time is earned in practice and in games,” Enfield said. “[Terrell] started our first game because he earned it. It’s a game-by-game decision. The way I coach, no one’s guaranteed minutes—you have to earn it on the court and in the classroom” Still, his shot proved to be the turning point, and he showed no signs of contempt for the coaches’ decision. A three from Jacobs and several layups from senior guard Pe’Shown Howard were enough for the Trojans to build up a 16-point advantage that they never came close to relinquishing for the remainder of the game. Though the level of execution seemed to fluctuate for the Trojans all game, one thing that was constant was the change in the players who were on the court. Enfield, still getting a feel for his roster, used 12 players against the Matadors. “We’re still trying to figure out everyone’s role on the team,” Wesley said. “We have a lot of talented guys ready to play.” Senior center Omar Oraby, who seemed eager to answer critics who thought he would not be able to fit well into Enfield’s fast-paced system, played with dominance, consistently muscling his way down low both on offense and defense. The Cairo, Egypt native punctuated his stellar performance with a three-point play amid multiple defenders late in the second half. His three points put the Trojans up by more than 20, and from there it was a cakewalk to the finish line for USC. Oraby finished up with 17 points and shot seven-for-eight from the field, one of his most productive offensive nights since he transferred to USC from Rice before last season. USC plays next on Friday at 8 p.m. against Northern Arizona. The game will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.   Follow us on Twitter @dailytrojan 
Really like the idea of the Enzone! Hopefully they get big and start showing up to games, attendance has been lacking, but I did see a good section of the “Enzone” shirt bearers. Fight On!
Thanks for the look on the Enzone! We’re really excited to have this student section and it’s getting bigger and better by the day. If anyone wants a shirt they will be for sale, just come up to any of us wearing the shirts at the game and we can get you one! Fight On and beat the Lumberjacks!
hope it’s televised LIVE on Dish…last night it was not

On Wednesday, the Undergraduate Student Government Funding Team hosted a workshop in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to teach student organizations how to apply for USG funding.
The workshop aimed to present how USG can support student organizations’ programming, development and professional efforts.
“We want to make sure the rules are clear and understandable, and make sure that these student organizations know how they can work their programs and applications to make them align better with our policies,” USG Treasurer Kameron VanWoerkom said.
The USG Funding Team is made up of four sections: leadership, discretionary, philanthropy and professional-academic. The workshop consisted of the director for each section speaking about the funding process related to his or her funding section.
The directors stressed the importance of clearing up confusion about the process, as the rules regarding applying for funds are quite extensive.
For funding eligibility, applicants must be part of student-led undergraduate organizations recognized either by the Office of Campus Activities or Greek Life, and USG will only fund specific expenses. It cannot offer reimbursement or advances.
“I want to make sure I’m perfectly clear on the rules. I don’t want you to leave here confused or with your head spinning,” VanWoerkom said.
Every student organization that attended the event received a $200 bonus voucher toward their funding.
This is the second funding workshop USG has hosted this year. The first was held in September and another will occur this December. By hosting the workshop three times this semester, the USG funding team hopes that every student organization will have access to adequate funding.
“We are just making sure that everyone who wants the to chance to attend can,” VanWoerkom said.
He noted that these workshops benefit both USG and the participating student organizations.
“These [workshops] help us help the organizations, because we can teach them how to get through the process all at once in a one-day, classroom setting,” VanWoerkom said.
Student organizations in attendance included the Korean Career Oriented Student Organization, the USC Rotaract Club, a service-oriented organization, and Trojan Business Alliance.
Tyler Tokunaga, assistant director of discretionary funding, noted that attendance at this meeting was less than at the one that took place in September.
“The funding application for fall is closed, so there’s less turnout than before,” Tokunaga said.
Organizations can currently apply for spring funding, however, and some student organizations attended the workshop in the hopes of learning more about the funding process.
Austin Mora, a junior majoring in business administration and the co-executive director of the Southern California Business Film Festival, came to the meeting hoping to clear up his confusion about funding.
“I think it’s sort of a confusing process if you don’t know the specifics about it,” he said. “I think the main goal is figuring out where your place is and how to best utilize the resources that are given to you.”
The complicated process of funding concerned some student organizations. Bobby Schimm, a senior majoring in business administration and a member of the USC Rotaract Club, said this was his first information session and the rules and regulations were a lot to process.
“I think there’s room for improvement [in the funding process]. It seems like there’s a lot of hoops to jump through,” Schimm said.
Jonas Guan, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, came to the meeting to learn how funding will work for a potential organization. He and three classmates are hoping to form a Computer Security Club.
“I learned how the USG funding works and it was incredibly helpful,” Guan said. “I think the process is pretty good so far.”

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted “Adobe Days: Think and Drinks Introduction to the Adobe Creative Cloud” on Tuesday. Several Adobe officials spoke with students and faculty about the new features in the new subscription service that offers all Adobe software to users.

The event was one of several during “Adobe Days” at Annenberg this week. “Adobe Days” began with a discussion and presentation on Nov. 11 by SoulPancake, a Los Angeles-based startup known primarily for its YouTube channel. The discussion presented Adobe Creative Cloud and all of the new features and web programs associated with it.
The Adobe representatives spoke of hardware requirements and recommendations for running Adobe software.
“Today’s standard is 8 gigabytes of RAM. Memory is really important,” said Sebastian DiStefano, a business development manager of video products for higher education at Adobe. “Using a solid state drive will make your computer and Adobe software run blazingly fast.”
Adobe representatives also spoke of USC-specific features such as the tutorials for all the programs in the Adobe Suite on Lynda.com, a free service for all USC students and faculty accessible from the USC Information Technology Services website.
Representatives emphasized the integration between various Adobe programs that allow nearly seamless editing between each program in the Adobe Creative Cloud. “You don’t work in siloed environments anymore,” DiStefano said. “You work in applications that communicate with each other.”
The event also showcased Behance, an online platform and community that is integrated with Creative Cloud and that serves as a place for artists and designers to showcase portfolios.
Students said they appreciated the tutorial events on the new software.
“It’s nice that Annenberg is hosting this event and really cool that Adobe could come over to show us all these new features,” said Gabrielle Nguyen Hurst, a freshman majoring in interactive entertainment.
The “Think and Drinks” workshop showed students and faculty some of the new features that were recently added to the Adobe Creative Cloud. More than 150 updates were added to the Adobe software suite on Halloween. DiStefano demonstrated how to edit videos using Photoshop, how to create interactive documents with InDesign and how to use the spot healing tool to edit out unwanted sounds in Audition using the spectral audio view. He also demonstrated how Adobe had added audio codecs for YouTube and Vimeo to Photoshop and Premiere Pro, which contained metadata that ensured the video sharing sites did not recode the video format, resulting in faster upload times and a better, more realistic editing software.
“I like the new features and like being able to save to the cloud,” said Sherveen Uduwana, a freshman majoring in interactive entertainment. “It’s very interesting and it’s awesome that students get Creative Cloud and somebody to teach them how to use it as well.”
Faculty and students also enjoyed refreshments from the future Annenberg Café that will be housed in the Wallis Annenberg Hall, which is currently under construction.
“Overall, I’m excited that Annenberg is embarking on the path they are. Providing their students with these creative tools is phenomenal,” DiStefano said. “It’s very unique, and there are not a lot of universities that are doing this. I think that providing it as a free tool for the students is going to drop down that barrier of access so that anyone who wants to be creative has access to these amazing, professional tools.”

USC hosts the largest number of international students of any university for the 12th consecutive year, according to the annual Open Doors report released Monday by the Institute of International Education.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ranked second and Purdue University ranked third in the report.
The university accounts for 9,840 international students, according to the report. Director of the Office of International Services Tony Tambascia said that more than 115 different countries are represented at USC. The largest portion of the international population is from China with more than 3,770 students. India was the second largest group with 1,806 students. About 72 percent of the international population is enrolled in graduate-level programs, mostly in the Viterbi School of Engineering.
USC’s reputation in the Pacific Rim and its commitment to recruiting, supported by an expanding alumni base in large cities, has attracted a large number of Indian and Chinese students, according to USC officials.
“USC continues to attract the most talented and creative students from all over the world, a point of tremendous pride for our community,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said in a press release. “USC’s international students arrive on our campuses with a broad range of experiences and perspectives, as well as extraordinary intellect and creativity. Their time at the university will remain with them for life, and our domestic students will learn about cultures outside their own. Throughout their lives, both groups of students will benefit from their professional connections.”
Tambascia added that USC helps international students adjust and thrive at the university.
“We also recognize that just enrolling large numbers of international students is not enough,” he said. “Great efforts are made to assist international students to make the most of their experience at USC, and to encourage them to take full advantage of the many ways to engage with other members of the university community, both inside and outside the classroom.”
According to the report, USC ranked ninth in the number of students who studied abroad during the 2011-2012 school year. About 2,065 USC students participated in study abroad programs during that year.

Tuesday night’s USG Senate Meeting featured presentations from Academic Affairs, the Marketing and Special Events branches of USG’s Program Board and the Center for Excellence in Teaching.
Academic Affairs Director Michael Yoshimura reported on his organization’s meetings with USC Information Technology Services and the dean of libraries.
Yoshimura said ITS plans to switch all students from the old webmail server to Google Apps.
“ITS wants us to switch everyone over to Google Apps from the old system. It’s more secure, you get more storage; all in all, it’s an easier system to work with,” Yoshimura said.
ITS wants to implement an online database for four-year course plans, similar to one used at Arizona State University. ITS employees are also conducting a wireless walkthrough to point out areas of bad service on campus and add routers if needed.
Yoshimura also told the Senate about a meeting with the dean of libraries to move forward on a $20 million renovation to Leavey Library.
“We’re expecting an overwhelming amount of people to support Leavey renovations,” Yoshimura said. “This is a student-driven issue, and students expect Leavey to be updated for the 21st century.”
Yoshimura announced that there will be an ITS help desk in front of Leavey Library for finals week to assist students with issues regarding USC Wireless and their USC email accounts, and a “New Library Hours” infographic will be posted at university libraries.
After Yoshimura spoke, the meeting shifted to Program Board’s marketing team. Jojo Zhang, social media assistant director of Program Board, and Paola Fernandez, historian assistant director of Program Board, discussed recent successes of their organization, such as increasing the number of likes on USG’s Facebook page from 900 to nearly 2,400 in the past few months.
The directors said changes in recruitment have helped the organization improve.
“We wanted to improve the committee’s strength,” Zhang said.
In previous years, Zhang said members didn’t have a lot of responsibility. New committees within marketing have increased the committee’s personnel. Extra committee members will be crucial in promoting upcoming events such as Conquest, Zhang said.
“We have about 30 members now, which is a huge boost,” Zhang said.
Special Events Committee Director Kim Chu presented on upcoming events.
Special Events sponsored several events on campus this fall, including the “Welcome Back Comedy Show with Jay Pharoah.”
“Our goal is to provide unique and impactful experiences to reach the widest range of USC students,” Chu said.
Finally, Undergraduate Fellow Nick Kosturos from the Center for Excellence in Teaching announced plans for an upcoming seminar that will allow USC students to give a 20-minute presentation on a topic of their choice.
“We’re hoping to make these seminars a regular occurrence,” Kostorous said.
The goal of the seminar is promoting extracurricular learning on campus and giving students a platform to present on topics.
“The idea is it’s led for students by students … We’re trying to find out what students are passionate about,” Kostorous said.
The seminar, titled “Sparking Intellectual Curiosity at USC,” will take place in the Taper Hall of Humanities on Nov. 21.

Rebirth was the prevailing theme on Tuesday night at the grand opening of El Centro Chicano’s new facility in the Student Union Building. Attendees celebrated the beginning of a new chapter in El Centro’s 40-year history at USC as many also bid farewell to the old facility at the United University Church.

The reception was held at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum with live entertainment provided by the Latin Grammy-nominated Trio Ellas. In attendance were USC students, staff, faculty and alumni such as Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry, in addition to many family members and friends of the university.
“It’s very difficult to move … It’s one of the hardest things to do … but moving also brings new chances and opportunities,” Oliver Mayer, associate professor of dramatic writing, said of the change.
Not all were happy with El Centro Chicano’s move. Space at the new location is limited in comparison to the former center, but the new space has been designed to be utilized as efficiently as possible. The kitchen and computer lab share a side room, while the main space, which has been dubbed the “Flex Room,” can be modified to serve as a space for networking and mixers or a combined study and socialization space.
Isabel Bravo, a third-year graduate student studying visual anthropology, lamented the loss of study spaces. Previously, the offices of the center were separate from a lecture hall and study space and could be locked up while still providing a place for students to study late at night.
“We delivered so many letters to [Provost Elizabeth Garrett],” Bravo said on the efforts of students and alumni to keep El Centro’s previous location. “[El Centro Chicano provides] so much for us, and now they can’t do that, even if they wanted to.”
Due in part to the different floor plan and new rules in the Student Union building, El Centro is unable to provide the type of late-night study space formerly available to students. In addition, cutbacks to work-study funding limit El Centro’s ability to hire after-hours student workers to keep the center open. Despite this, El Centro officials were hopeful that the new location would soon garner more support.
“Even the third- and fourth-years are starting to see the value of the new location, although they still have the history of the old location,” said Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano.
Some student organizations are excited to begin utilizing the new space.
“We definitely tried to see [the move] as an opportunity to do something different,” said Valerie Fernandez, executive director of the Latina/o Student Assembly. “LSA definitely had to shift where we meet; we currently meet in a lounge in the Campus Center, but a lot of students have definitely expressed interest in holding meetings at the new facility.”
For Marlin Rodriguez, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, the center’s more central location provides many benefits.
“I’ve heard various stuff about how El Centro offered various services in the past … but I don’t fully understand the negativity,” Rodriguez said. “I kind of like the new location. Since Student Union is right there, I can always go by El Centro between classes and grab a quick snack or something like that.”
In addition, El Centro Chicano provides free printing services, which Espana and Rodriguez both said they make use of.
Following the speeches given at the Forum, attendees were invited to tour the new facility. Hosts conducted a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony, as well as the unveiling of a new mural by Alfredo Davalos, who also painted the first mural at El Centro’s UUC location 17 years ago. The first mural will be preserved by the UUC.
“The new mural is a continuation of the other one. This one is more complete,” Davalos said.
Beginning from the bottom left of the mural, dark blue silhouettes painted on green fields make their way to the right, gaining color and increasing in definition until they finally manifest as a great fist which pushes open the doors of El Centro Chicano to the rest of the university — embodying one of the goals of moving the facility to a more centralized location.
El Centro Chicano shares a floor with the Asian-Pacific American Student Assembly and the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, and has already collaborated on a number of events.
“I definitely think [the new location] offers a great opportunity for collaboration,” Vela said. “But first and foremost, our center is a Latina/o ethnic center. It is the founding center, out of the Civil Rights Movement. We have the professional staff, the focus and resources to focus on the Latino community, and that’s what truly makes El Centro a home.”

Every November, beards grow longer as the days grow shorter. No Shave November is a show of support and a way to raise awareness about men’s health issues.
Though an annual phenomenon, No Shave November can still be considered a trend. Some people partake in the seasonal activity while others do not. In high school, I just assumed No Shave November was an alliterative gimmick invented by lazy older guys whose facial hair actually grew in full patterns rather than patches.
This year was the first November that I learned of Movember’s true purpose. In an effort to raise awareness about prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health, men all around the world grow out their mustaches and facial hair. The connection to cancer awareness is that patients often lose hair during cancer treatment and by embracing facial hair, participants in the monthlong movement are displaying an outward show of support.
Recently, various online organizations have popped up to take advantage of the social media front as a means of gaining awareness for No Shave November’s causes. The aptly called No-ShaveNovember.com, one such web-based organization that facilitates donations to the American Cancer Society, eloquently summarizes the concept behind the monthlong movement: “The goal of No-Shave November is to grow awareness by embracing our hair, which many cancer patients lose, and letting it grow wild and free. Donate the money you usually spend on shaving and grooming for a month to educate about cancer prevention, save lives, and aid those fighting the battle.”
Movember.com is another organization that employs social media to promote men’s health awareness during November. Men, as Mo Bros, and women, as Mo Sistas, are equally encouraged by Movember.com to participate by registering, submitting photos and donating.
Each website encourages its registrants to spread the word about Movember and form teams to inspire others to donate to the cause as well. Bar graphs found on Movember.com show that there is a steady upward trend of participants registering and letting their hair grow wild and wooly over long periods of time.
Girls are certainly not excluded from participating in the mustache merriment. For the die-hards out there, leg shaving can be taken off the morning agenda and waxing appointments can be skipped.An extra tuft of armpit hair is also an option to show your facial-hair spirit. More realistically, Mo Sistas can participate by adding mustaches to their profile photo in solidarity with their Mo Bros.
Regardless of the ability to grow facial hair, everyone can donate. No Shave November is a 30-day period dedicated to sparking conversations and inspiring others to give back to worthy causes that do not always receive attention. According to Movember.com, more than 3 million participants have raised $446 million for the cause. Last year, 209,000 men and women in the United States participated in Movember to raise more than $21 million.
The history behind No Shave November is legendary. Not necessarily in the epic sense of the word, but in the way that the movement’s history is shrouded in mystery and hearsay. One Internet source claimed that Movember originated among the followers of Plato, the classical Athenian philosopher who supposedly encouraged his students to imitate their elders by growing beards. A quick perusal of Plato’s Republic proved this to be false. Yet, in retrospect, I should have realized this claim was untrue since ancient Greece idealized the smooth, chiseled physiques of young men. Nobody’s perfect — or historically literate.
This brings up a present-day expectation that deserves questioning. Philanthropic reasons aside, why are men only encouraged to grow out their facial hair during a single, measly month of the year? Instead, male underwear models are waxed as if they were trying out for the swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated. Probably this is just so their washboards abs are more easily admired. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining about that.
Admittedly, we no longer live in the free love era of the ’60s and ’70s, a simpler time when body hair was hailed as a masculine ideal. Once the ’80s rolled around and metrosexuality gained speed among the mainstream population, manscaping attracted more followers and brought back the classical practice of men holding onto their youthful appearance for as long as possible. That Adonis image, in which a man’s cheekbones and chest are laid bare to the elements, definitely persists today.
On the other hand, attractive men with facial hair do exist, despite the representations that abound in popular culture and mass media. Take Hugh Jackman’s portrayal of comic book antihero Wolverine in the X-Men series of films. That feral fighter would be nowhere without his grizzly jaw and abundant chest hair. For the retro lovers out there, Tom Selleck is a great example of the sexy ’stache. His mustache is an icon arguably even more so than the man himself. And who could forget President Lincoln? There’s a reason he’s known as Abe the Babe.
There are also certain benefits to letting your facial hair grow out that sometimes go unappreciated outside of November. Not setting aside time to shave in the morning means more time for sleeping in or actually having a chance to eat breakfast before work or class. Taking a break from shaving is also helpful for improving skin health, especially for those with sensitive skin. I would know, since sometimes after a morning shave it looks as if I’ve escaped a nasty West Side Story knife fight.
Whether you prefer to be clean-shaven or mustachioed, or even if you prefer your partner to be smooth or hairy, No Shave November is inspired by a great cause. Participate however you can, even if it means drawing a Sharpie mustache on your finger for an entire month.

There’s nothing quite like the feeling of reluctance when you begin the last novel in a series you have devoted much time too. Jennifer L. Armentrout’s Sentinel is no different.
Faltering finish · The final installment of Jennifer Armentrout’s Covenant series resolves the story, but fails to impress most readers. – Photo courtesy of Spencer Hill Press
Armentrout, a New York Times best-selling author, now offers her fans Sentinel, the fifth and final installment of the Covenant series, which is as heartbreaking as it is physically draining to read. Sentinel tells the story of Alexandra “Alex” Andros who prepares for war against the god Ares. With all of the troubles that Alex and her boyfriend, Aiden St. Delphi, faced to be together in the previous installments, the two now journey through the Underworld to release and defeat one of the most dangerous gods of their time.
And while Sentinel finishes the series with an emotional bang, there is too much reliance on romance and not enough action in between to call this a complete success.
What works is Armentrout’s vivid imagination. The world she creates throughout the entire series, and especially in Sentinel, is something to admire. Armentrout manages to convey the imaginary world with incredible restraint. When Armentrout describes the Underworld and how it makes Alex feel, there aren’t copious flowery adjectives and adverbs that force the reader to feel a certain way. Instead, the author graciously allows the reader to determine his or her own emotions through Alex’s actions, an effective tactic she utilizes throughout the entire story.
Another element of Sentinel that works well are the plot twists and use of foreshadowing, which can manipulate the reader (albeit in the best way possible). Armentrout is quick to add a twist that brings attention to a plot point from the beginning of the series that can connect all five of the novels in a logical manner. Unfortunately, Armentrout did not include such a twist until the last part of the novel.
The late-arriving plot twists kept the story from being predictable. But often times with fantasy series, such as Sacrifice of Love from The Grey Wolves series,”the last book takes the entire novel to get to any action that provides any type of external conflict. And Sentinel, unfortunately, falls prey to such a custom.
The fact that Armentrout also writes New Adult fiction, romance books geared toward the age group of 18 through 25, could give her some leeway regarding why this book relied heavily on the romance to keep the novel progressing. The first four books in the Covenant series provided enough external conflict throughout to progress the story without overdoing the romance angle. But for some reason, Sentinel doesn’t have that luxury.
Aiden and Alex’s relationship at the start of the series had a lot more depth, as they were fighting their feelings for each other in a world where the rules forbade them from being together. But outside of those rules, the two also had their own individual issues that affected the world outside of each other outside of their relationship. Now that they have declared their love for each other by the final book, there wasn’t much conflict outside of their journey through the Underworld, which made their dialogue cheesy and didn’t move the story along. The majority of their interactions in Sentinel consist of Aiden watching out for Alex and acting as her protector, which got old after a while.
Though romance can be a selling point, especially in today’s popular fiction, Armentrout usually steers clear of suggestive romance scenes and cheesy dialogue to sell her stories, like in her other fantasy series, Lux. The worst part is that these romance scenes often don’t tell us anything new about the characters, instead coming across as pointless and repeating what the reader already knows. It was clear by book three, Deity, that Aiden loved Alex, and crystal clear that Aiden would do anything for Alex’s benefit in book four, Apollyn. What else was there to make clear by the final book? With the lack of tension between the two characters, the reader didn’t need any wordy reiterations in nearly every single chapter, which is what literally filled the pages until the last third of the novel. Plus, there was not enough external conflict to make up for it.
But even with all the redundant love scenes and a lack of action to progress the story, there is still a sadness that comes with ending a series. Seeing the characters develop on the page until their journey is over is a journey of its own; one that leaves you feeling a little empty, yet peaceful in spite of the outcome.
And with Sentinel, this feeling is  no different.

It’s almost noon, which means it’s almost closing time at Eggslut, the old food truck turned freshly opened Grand Central Market breakfast concept. Down the sleek black granite counter, chef and co-owner Alvin Cailan, who’s built like an offensive lineman, scrambles eggs in a saucepan with a surgeon’s attention to detail. Cailan looks over his shoulder and perspiration glistens on his temple as he talks to another handsome, tall Asian man with slicked back hair.
Putting out the goods · Chef Alvin Cailan (center, background) tends to skirt steaks for Eggslut’s popular dish of steak and eggs. Eggslut’s opening proved successful: The diner sold out of food in their first weekend. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
“Was the scramble for the steak and eggs?”
“No, it was for the Slut,” the man replies.
Cailan pulls the saucepan off the heat and throws its contents into the garbage. It’s a part of the process: with eggs, as with restaurants in general, timing is everything. The signage on the storefront indicates that Eggslut is “Coming Soon,” but it’s been putting out its egg-centric concoctions in its newfound GCM digs since last week.
The word’s already out, by the way. The scene on a crowded late Tuesday morning is sedate compared to the morning rush, where diners scramble at the break of dawn to take a crack at securing one of Eggslut’s coveted counter seats. They all want to try the steak and eggs, a humbly named special that’s got everyone from Monterey Park to Santa Monica in a tizzy. Cailan dusts a healthy layer of salt and pepper on the skirt steaks, and gives the steak its initial sear. The chef then puts a dollop of butter on top, which he uses to baste the steak before serving it with a side of two organic sunny side up eggs. It’s a labor-intensive process, and despite what seems like a steep price tag of $12, the execution is worth every penny.
The menu also offers an array of egg-based breakfast sandwiches, with selections that include a house-made turkey sausage and egg sandwich that’s served with honey mustard aioli. Other inventive sandwiches include a bacon sammie with chipotle ketchup and the Fairfax, a scrambled egg sandwich with caramelized onions and Sriracha mayo. All of these are served on a house-made brioche bun that’s lightly toasted before serving.
What Eggslut is famous for, however, is the Slut. Clocking in at a comparatively hefty $10 —the sandwiches are all less than $8 — when the dish arrives, the name starts to make sense. Most diners will stare down at the dainty jar (which is reminiscent of a baby food container), pull their head back, crinkle their nose and probably say to themselves, “Wait, I just paid $10 for this sh-t?”
On paper, the dish is a coddled egg poached in a glass jar atop a bed of potato puree, topped with chives and served with three minuscule crostini. But take the plunge, and one really starts to appreciate the experience of the Slut. Breaking the yolk and stirring it into the mixture of potato puree and chives creates a slightly savory jam that’s perfect for spreading on the crostini. Take the first bite and it all makes sense why the Slut is so highly in demand. A slightly salty note of potato puree balances out the clean, understated richness of the egg yolk. Chives lighten up the proceedings, but not by much. This is a rich dish, and the minuscule portion is completely justified. Anything more and it’s too heavy.
Then the scrambled eggs arrive. To paraphrase Chef Gordon Ramsay, a proper scrambled egg is the ultimate test of a chef’s ability to control heat. Overcook them, and they lose the creamy richness that accentuates the taste of yolk. Undercook them, and they’re a runny, inedible mess. It should come as no surprise that Eggslut’s scrambled eggs — prepared by Alvin Cailan — are perfectly cooked. They’re just substantive enough to sustain the taste of rich yolk, while being a tad runny for texture and neatly balanced with a smattering of chive.
Of the drink offerings, a four-dollar orange juice pops out on the menu. Few orange juices that don’t involve equal parts champagne justify such a price tag, but this particular O.J. is a stone cold thirst-killer. Pressed by the nearby Press Brothers Juicery, it’s raw, organic orange juice that’s served unpasteurized in a small, ten ounce bottle. The result is an incredibly clean juice that’s not too sweet but practically bursting with the flavor of freshly squeezed oranges.
Funnily enough, for a restaurant with a rather extreme name, Eggslut embodies a keen attention to detail and fantastic execution when it comes to subtly balancing flavors. So show her to your friends, introduce her to mom and yes, put a ring on it: This slut’s a real keeper.

Applying to college is stressful. No matter how hard I try to forget those long hours of slaving over admissions essays, pouring over my SAT study book and visiting countless college campuses, that unease and anxiety I felt three years ago is all too easy to recall. Between throwing ourselves into extracurricular activities and struggling to raise our GPAs as high school seniors, there wasn’t time for much else as we focused on where we would spend the next four years of our lives.
Dannny Razzano | Daily Trojan
 
But now, college applicants have something else to worry about on top of everything else: their social media accounts.
It’s not as if social media wasn’t already popular three years ago, but in just three years, the trend has escalated to another level. Teens now have a plethora of accounts on various sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google+, just to name a few. Those accounts are useful for social interaction and networking, but for a college applicant, the sites have become breeding grounds for inappropriate material that could ultimately cost them their coveted college acceptance letters.
According to a report by The New York Times, 31 percent of 381 college admissions officers who participated in a Kaplan telephone questionnaire admitted to looking at an applicant’s Facebook or other personal social media page in an effort to learn more about them, up from just 10 percent in 2008. Another 29 percent of those surveyed said that they have Googled an applicant. College admissions officers are spending an increasing amount of time online as they begin to use students’ social media accounts to determine whether or not their submitted applications match their actual persona.
Colleges have denied certain students admission based on their officers’ findings, despite the applicants’ impressive GPAs, test scores and other accomplishments. In addition, those students are not notified that their social media profiles are the cause of their rejection.
This invasion of privacy isn’t encouraged, but it also isn’t prohibited. Using social media as an acceptance indicator is relatively new, so there are no rules or limitations on the practice at most universities. There are currently no set regulations in line to define what online stalking is appropriate and what crosses the line.
But should students be denied acceptance to their dream college and have their futures changed forever because of a picture they posted at the age of 16 or 17 years old? Absolutely not. And if any online inquisition were to take place, there must be regulations limiting it.
For one thing, online accounts have a lot of misleading content. Pictures could come off as funny to one person but offensive to another. Also, funny tweets and Facebook statuses are meant for the eyes of friends, not admissions officers. An admissions officer shouldn’t judge the student based on what can be found about them online — these kids have worked much too hard to be thwarted by a stupid online mistake. And a person is so much more than a status or a tweet.
Furthermore, the fact that admissions officers even have the ability to snoop on prospective students online is incredibly inappropriate. I surmise that most college admissions officers today did not have to worry about censoring their own digital footprints when they themselves were applying to colleges — they should not be able to judge students this way, considering that they were never subjected to this kind of scrutiny.
Despite the unfairness of online snooping, it is becoming an inevitable occurrence. There must be some type of national regulation and criteria for officers to abide by when using the Internet to lurk the profiles of students. Getting into college is hard enough without the added stress of maintaining a perfect social media presence. College applicants have so many other application details to worry about that they deserve to be cut a break.

You can’t stop an admission counselor from Googling just like you can’t stop a potential employer, friend, parent or total stranger.  Nothing about the admission process guarantees privacy and certainly the same for when you post things on the internet.  Control what people will find when they search for you, not who will search for you.
I strongly disagree with this article.  People—of all ages—need to realize that what you post on your online profiles is available for the world to see, especially if you are not careful enough to adjust your privacy settings. 
“But should students be denied acceptance to their dream college and have their futures changed forever because of a picture they posted at the age of 16 or 17 years old?”
Should students be denied acceptance to their dream college and have their futures changed forever because they misread an SAT question?  If you post a picture on your facebook that may offend some people, you should be prepared to deal with the consequences.  At the very least, hide the photo from the public.  It’s really not very difficult.
If “funny tweets” are meant for the eyes of your friends not admissions officers, make them private, so it can only be seen by the eyes of your friends. 
In today’s job market, applicants can expect to be vetted in ways such as a social media background check.  Rather than prohibiting college admissions officers from viewing information that is available to the public and potential hirers, we should educate kids about the importance of maintaining a social media presence that doesn’t negatively impact your reputation.
Cecilia:
Rob’s comment is exactly the point. There can not be an invasion of privacy when the information is public. 
Admissions officers are charged with  assembling a diverse, vibrant and safe student community. If social media shows evidence of anti-social or deviant behavior of the part of an applicant then that is absolutely fair game.
I don’t believe anyone is stating that colleges are looking for boy and girl scouts. If, however, they are looking for individuals who will benefit and enhance their community then social media is a great venue for that assessment. 
Students should be embracing this trend as a way to set themselves apart from others in the ever more competitive world of college admissions. Rather than hiding, they should enhance their presence and extend the character traits, activities and interests that they present in their application essays onto their social media.
Employers are also viewing social media when vetting employees, so learning how to curate one’s social media is an important skill for all of us to learn.

As the dad of a freshman, I do feel your pain … sort of.
But first, let’s be sure we understand the concept of privacy. Once you post to anything to the Internet, it’s no longer private. That puts your post into the public domain.
Of course it also raises the question for Facebook snooping about where the students have their privacy levels set. I still can’t see my daughter’s Facebook posts because I don’t have that level of access. So how are recruiters getting to this info?
Finally, before they send an app off to their dream school, a student could just go back and remove some of the party photos couldn’t they?
Nice writing on a good topic. Keep it up.

The media loves covering Detroit.
For the past few years, Detroit has been a victim of economic failings, inadequate school systems and widespread corruption, all of which made it perfect fodder for national news. All of Detroit’s failings eventually accumulated into the media frenzy surrounding the city’s July 18 filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.
So when the media brings Detroit up at any time, many Americans expect to hear stories on crime and financial shortfalls, none of which move the emotional needle too far.
Then there are times when Detroit isn’t in the news when it should be.
According to the Detroit Free Press, a mass shooting took place on Nov. 6 in the back room of a Detroit barbershop. The shooting spree killed three people and wounded six others. Police said the barbershop was known as a place where gambling and dice games occurred.
Unfortunately, the United States is now numb to news of a mass shooting. Within the past few years, the country has amassed a laundry list of shootings. From the Aurora theater massacre to the Sandy Hook tragedy to the Santa Monica College rampage followed by the Washington Navy Yard shooting, people have watched and read the result of mass carnage time and time again. The media is drawn to covering these shootings because they have the elements of a strong news story: impact, human interest, sensationalism and conflict.
Though the FBI defines mass murder as a single incident in which a perpetrator kills four or more people, the media shapes shootings that occur in public venues as mass shootings regardless of the victims killed. On Nov. 1, a sole gunman entered the Los Angeles International Airport and killed Transportation Security Agent Gerardo Hernandez, making Hernandez the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty. Despite the single victim, many outlets such as the Los Angeles Times declared it a mass shooting. In the hours after the shootings, there was wall-to-wall coverage and in-depth analyses of the shooter, his victim, his weapon of choice and his motive. Airports are not the only unusual spot for a mass shooting to occur. Many suburbs around the nation have also experienced mass shootings. Of the 25 deadliest mass 3 in the United States, 19 of them have occurred in suburban settings. Usually after each shooting incident occurs in a school or mall or movie theater or church, there is a person interviewed by the media who says, “Nothing bad was ever supposed to happen here.”
Therefore the lack of coverage of the deadly shooting in Detroit is not a result of the relatively low numbers of people killed and injured in the barbershop; instead, it shows a lack in judgment of what the media considers a tragedy.
The expectation is that gun violence mostly happens in cities, which tends to be true. The mass distribution of New Jack City films and rap music reaffirms the image that gun violence is integral to urban life.
In the same way, however, this expectation for violence poses a challenge to the media. It reshapes the old media adage that says, “What bleeds leads.” Yet if it always bleeds, it begins to lose its sensationalism, conflict and emotional impact because it becomes the expected, the norm.
It is not as if people in the media do not care about the plight of urban dwellers. It’s that they have produced the same images for so long. The Joker from The Dark Knight might describe it best: “Nobody panics when things go ‘according to plan,’ even if the plan is horrifying!” There is no good gun violence, whether it happens in the suburbs or the city. A death at the hands of a gun is always tragic and generally unexpected.
Placing the incidents of gun violence that regularly take place in cities such as Detroit to the forefront of the national discussion, Americans must be shaken out of their complacency for these incidents because when people become used to incidents of violence in certain cities and venues, a shooting in an elementary school or airport won’t seem as uncommon. Then people seeking to gain infamy for inflicting harm will just search for a new public space in which to open fire.
Forgetting about the murders that occur in urban settings makes us numb to other mass shootings to come. When that occurs, the media will not be able to fully analyze and cover our country’s problem with gun violence.

Violence is rampant, gun violence is rare, mass shootings even more rare. 300 million people, 47% idle and on the dole, 250 million guns, it is a sign of great restraint that there are not mass shootings daily.

On Monday, USC sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor was named the Pac-12 Special Teams Player of the Week following Saturday’s record-breaking performance in the punt return game that led to the Trojans’ 62-28 victory over Cal.
The Tampa, Fla. native tied a Pac-12 record for punts returned for touchdowns in a game (two) by taking punts of 75 and 93 yards for touchdowns. The 93-yard return was tied for the second-longest in USC history.
His 168 total punt return yards also set a new mark for most by a USC player in a single game.
Though he did most of his damage in the return game, Agholor also recorded four receptions for 35 yards on offense.
Agholor becomes the second USC player this year to be honored with this award, after redshirt sophomore punter Kris Albarado received it the week of Sept. 23-29.
Agholor was also named to the Paul Hornung Award Honor Roll for his performance. The Hornung Award is presented annually to the most versatile player in major college football. In addition, Agholor was named the National Punt Returner National All-Purpose Performer of the Week by the College Football Performance Awards.
While injuries have slowed junior wide receiver Marqise Lee at times this season, Agholor has played an increased role in the punt and kickoff return game. So far this season, he’s returned 10 punts for 288 total yards and 5 kickoffs for 77 yards.
Through the air, the 6-foot, 185-lb wideout has caught 36 passes for 647 yards and three touchdowns.

The USC women’s volleyball team knows that the toughest matches to win are the ones away from the friendly confines of the Galen Center. But after taking care of business at home, the Women of Troy have extra momentum and motivation for their final road trip of the season.
The No. 4 Women of Troy dominated the Oregon State Beavers Sunday in another 3-0 sweep (25-21, 25-11, 25-12) to improve to 22-3 overall and 12-2 in the Pac-12.
Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard registered eight kills while hitting an outstanding .571. Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu was also stellar in recording a match-high 13 kills to along with a .522 attacking clip. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio notched eight kills, 11 digs and two service aces in another impressive all-around performance.
“I think we’re looking great,” Olgard said. “We had some hard practices this week in preparation for the games, and I’m excited to play Washington.
The Beavers put up a fight in the first set and stormed ahead 5-2, but USC came back to tie it at eight apiece on a Bricio kill. Both sides went back and forth for the remainder of the set and hit a standstill at 19-all before junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer broke the tie with a kill. USC pulled away and stymied the Oregon State comeback, finishing off the set 25-21 on an Olgard kill. The Women of Troy registered 18 kills to OSU’s 14 while also outhitting the Beavers .275 to .208.
USC turned the tide to open the second set, pulling ahead 8-2 after two kills from Olgard and a third from Nwanebu. Freshman outside hitter Elise Ruddins put the Women of Troy up 11-6 with a kill and they never looked back, rattling off an 8-0 run that culminated in back-to-back blocks by Bricio and Schraer. Sophomore middle blocker Kiara Wright got in on the action, knocking down a kill to seal the set 25-11. The Women of Troy held the Beavers to a measly negative .111 hitting percentage and just six kills.
The third set saw much of the same, as USC went up 10-4 with Nwanebu registering kills on three of four attempts. OSU fought back to pull within 12-8, but the Women of Troy took 10 of the next 12 points and went up 22-10 on a kill by sophomore middle blocker Alicia Ogoms. Senior outside hitter Sara Shaw brought up match point at 24-12 before Olgard and junior outside hitter Emily Young combined on a block to seal the set 25-12 and keep Oregon State winless in Pac-12 play (0-14).
The Women of Troy once again had a balanced offensive attack as eight players registered a kill and the team combined to hit .327. On the other side of the ball, Bricio (11) and senior libero Natalie Hagglund (18) hit double figures in digs and helped hold Oregon State to just .045 hitting on the afternoon.
The win also marked the 10th straight over the Beavers, against whom USC is now 47-8 all time. USC also swept all 12 sets against Oregon and Oregon State for the first time since 2004.
USC will embark on its last road trip of the season to play Washington and Washington State next weekend.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted Adobe Days: SoulPancake, a presentation and discussion given by SoulPancake, a Los Angeles-based startup created by actor Rainn Wilson, most well-known for its YouTube channel by the same name, in the Annenberg Auditorium Monday night.
By far the most popular SoulPancake video is “A Pep Talk from Kid President to You,” which has nearly 30 million views on YouTube to date. The company has rapidly become a leader in methods of delivering multiple media forms in an engaging and modern manner.
Many students came to the event and were very excited and interested in the presentation.
“When I found out that it was started by Rainn Wilson, I immediately had to know more about it,” said LaVafjah Williams, a graduate student in communication management. “I looked it up and it looked super creative and innovative and progressive, and it was very engaging, so I wanted to come see how they’re using these digital platforms to create something so amazing.”
The actual presentation and discussion was preceded by a “Pancake Bar” where those attending had the opportunity to eat pancakes with toppings and sausages in the Annenberg East Lobby.
“The pancakes are delicious and the presentation was awesome. I’m very impressed,” said Elliot Kim, a freshman majoring in economics.
Martin Desmond Roe and Georgia Koch spoke at the event. Roe is an Oscar-nominated filmmaker whose company, Dirty Robber, is a preferred SoulPancake partner that does post-production work for most of SoulPancake’s work. He was nominated for a 2012 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for his short film Buzkashi Boys. Roe is also a graduate of the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Channel Manager of SoulPancake Georgia Koch oversees the development of the startup’s daily programming on their YouTube channel.
“It’s cool to see USC alum working in the real world and doing real things,” said Jennifer Chen, a freshman majoring in art with an emphasis in sculpture and design. “It’s also inspirational to me, and to see such a young and innovative company doing this kind of work really gives me the motivation to try and start something like this myself.”
At the presentation itself, Roe and Koch spoke about how they used the Adobe Creative Cloud throughout their work, as well as their experiences working in the creative industry.
“It’s consistency and dedication. It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” Roe said of his experiences of working in the creative industry.
The SoulPancake representatives also spoke of how they had gone from a small startup with 5,000 subscribers to more than 677,000 subscribers in one year. The two were impressed by how more than 35 percent of Annenberg students had downloaded and were using Adobe Creative Cloud. They considered multimedia literacy and knowledge and familiarity with industry-standard creative software to be imperative to those seeking to work in the communications and entertainment industries.
“When you’re first starting, you need to be a generalist. You need to know how to put text on a film, how to do an audio pass and how to make graphics in Photoshop all yourself,” Roe said. “But later on, you become a specialist, so knowing both sides is very important.”
Many students thought positively about the event and greatly enjoyed both the pancake bar and the talk afterward.
“It turned out to be more professional and sophisticated than I thought, because I thought that it was going to be a really fun event. Not that it doesn’t look fun, but it’s very professional as well,” said Albert Yue, a freshman majoring computer science (games).

The USC Veterans Association, USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Transfer and Veterans Student Programs organized USC’s first annual Veterans Day Ceremony in front of Tommy Trojan at noon on Monday.
“The most important thing taken into account is the fact that it is Veterans Day, so everyone came together to collaborate and organize the event to celebrate all the men and women that have served our country,“ said Hsiao Hsu, vice president of the USC Veterans Association.

The event began with the Trojan Marching Band playing the national anthem and the USC fight song. Keith Williams, president of the USC Veterans Association, talked about the life of a Trojan veteran, Benjamin Salomon, and his struggles and accomplishments.
Hsu then introduced Mikal Vega, a veteran who spoke about his experiences.
“The highlight of my career was getting to go downrange in Iraq and serving with some of the most incredible men,” Vega said.
Joshua Castro, historian of the Veterans Association, introduced D. Wayne Robinson, a veteran and the president of the Student Veterans of America.
The Student Veterans of America, founded in 2008, helps keep tax dollars investing in veterans of the country and makes sure that all student veterans excel in postsecondary programs in order to contribute to society.
“Get to know student veterans that are on campus at USC because they are the next generation of leaders, at the community, state and national level and I am honored to stand as their representative,” Robinson said.
Many students expressed their support for the event and for veterans themselves. Isaac Steele, a senior majoring in computer science (games), said he thought the event was a nice way to commemorate veterans.
“It was great hearing the perspectives of veterans and what they’re doing to help other veterans now. It’s just nice that the campus put on something to recognize this Veterans Day and recognize the veterans throughout the week instead of it just being a holiday on the calendar,” Steele said.
Yilin Zhang, a freshman majoring in business administration, said it’s important to observe Veterans Day because of the sacrifices veterans made for the United States.
“They were brave enough to go and fight for this country, so I think a day to commemorate and celebrate them is important,” Zhang said.

USC Spectrum hosted a panel called “Are Sports a Religion?” in the USC Caruso Catholic Center on Monday night.
The panel was introduced by Shawn Sorenson, director of the Spirituality and Sports Program at USC, and consisted of Gotham Chopra, co-founder of Graphic India and Liquid Comics; Dan Durbin, professor and director of the Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media and Society and Marcellus Wiley, a former football player and current ESPN co-host. Varun Soni, the USC dean of religious life, moderated the talk.

According to Sorenson, interest in religion is at an all-time low while interest in sports is at an all-time high.
Twenty percent of Americans are now formally disaffiliated with religion. In 1950, it was 2 percent. Among the younger generation (those who are under 30 years old), it is closer to 40 percent, according to Soni.
“People are finding the answers to the ultimate questions in different ways, and one of those ways is popular culture,” Soni said.
Chopra said he agreed and found a way to tie sports to religion.  He is a fan of the Boston Red Sox, Boston Celtics and New England Patriots.
“I’m definitely a devotee of the religion of sports,” Chopra said.
He compared sports to religion in the sense that both require participation and belief. Chopra said sports are also considered spiritual because people in the audience really have no power over what happens in the game, regardless of the superstitions that they have.
“It’s a very salient topic in terms of how sports themselves function within our society and how we identify ourselves with athletes and with teams,” said Patricia Silva, a junior majoring in communication. “It makes them become very religious in that sense.”
Durbin, who has published articles about sports, popular culture and sports media studies, said that sports and religion are not always thought of as similar.
“I don’t think that most people look at USC football as a religion per se, but there are ritualistic and social elements to it,” Durbin said. “Shared community is the core identifying point between sports and religion.”
Silva said, however, there is a contrast between what people are looking for in terms of ultimate answers, which makes it impossible for sports to be truly considered a religion.
“I don’t think that people are looking to sports for an answer to the higher questions such as the meaning of life, but I do think [sports] function in a similar way to religion since we worship different teams and players,” Silva said.
Durbin also brought up the issue of lack of participation from sports fans. Often, fans watch from their home television screens, since their televisions often have a better view and they are still able to interact with their favorite teams.
“It is less of the community relationship it once was, just as with religion,” Durbin said.
Wiley, who co-hosts ESPN2’s SportsNation, as well as Max & Marcellus on 710AM ESPN Radio in Los Angeles, said society should not look up to sports players as idols since they are only human and they also make mistakes. He said people only know one aspect of these athletes and don’t know them at a personal level.
Wiley also talked about the lack of life plans in some football players, especially since he saw that many of them identified themselves as “football players” and had no real sense of identity.
The panelists did not come to a unanimous conclusion about whether or not sports can truly be considered a religion.
“Although both sports and religion can be paralleled, there will always be controversy about whether sports can truly be considered religion,” Austin Lee, a junior majoring in human biology, said. “That was seen throughout the discussion.”

Conservative pundit Ann Coulter spoke to students and guests Sunday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom as part of a speaking tour to promote her new book, Never Trust a Liberal Over 3 — Especially a Republican.
The conversation with Coulter, who has written nine New York Times best-sellers, was moderated by Jim Hughes, a writer whose work has been featured in and on Politico and Fox News.
The event was co-sponsored by the Political Student Assembly, the USC College Republicans and the Hancock Park Patriots, a grassroots Tea Party organization in Los Angeles.
Mark Sonnenklar, president of the Hancock Park Patriots, said he was happy Coulter was on hand for the event.
“She brings a lot of attention anywhere she goes,” Sonnenklar said. “If Ann Coulter can support the USC College Republicans and the Hancock Park Patriots, that’s really a good thing.”
Coulter did not originally expect to be speaking at USC.
“I was just doing this fun little Tea Partier event and then they combined with the USC College Republicans,” Coulter told the Daily Trojan.
Coulter and Hughes discussed the high points of Coulter’s book, a collection of her favorite weekly columns from the past 12 years. The talk combined the controversial satire and biting wit Coulter is known for with her more serious thoughts on the future of the Republican Party.
After describing how she envisioned each MSNBC host committing suicide, Coulter turned the conversation to improving the Republican Party’s chances in the 2016 election and beyond.
“Half of the candidates running in GOP primaries shouldn’t be running at all,” she said.
Coulter also criticized the special interest groups that take candidates’ focus away from the voters, citing “the role of consultants, ego and greed” as a negative force in American politics.
Before the event, a group of students gathered to demonstrate their opposition to Coulter’s views.
One of the protesters was Nora Snyder, a senior majoring in international relations and Middle East studies.
“The political rhetoric in this country is the most polarized it’s ever been,” Snyder said. “When [Coulter] comes out making statements that are anti-Islam, anti-[lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender], anti-Hispanic and anti-rational speech, we’re out here to show that not all Trojans support that type of rhetoric.”
Ultimately, both the protesters and the event organizers agreed that it was important for Coulter to be given the chance to speak.
“The First Amendment protects everybody, even those people we don’t agree with,” Snyder said. “She can say her piece, and we can say ours.”
Jennifer Massey, president of the USC College Republicans, said the last-minute opportunity provided the rare chance to bring a conservative speaker to campus.
“We wanted to bring another opinion to school and let the students decide, because we don’t get a lot of conservative speakers on campus, if any at all,” Massey said.
Massey also praised the PSA, who worked with the College Republicans to put together the event, for helping bring speakers from both major political parties to USC.
“The PSA is supposed to be a nonpartisan organization that helps bring speakers to campus, and they have been such a great help to me and the USC College Republicans,” Massey said.
When asked if she was happy that the event had inspired a demonstration, Massey was emphatic in her support.
“Absolutely. I believe in free speech, and the USC CR believes in free speech,” she said.
Coulter, who also spoke at a meet-and-greet prior to the talk, criticized those who said she shouldn’t speak on campus.
“I think the ones who are happy to have me here are very, very smart,” Coulter said. “I think the ones who are unhappy to have me here are a little stupider.”
Eric Dubbury, a junior majoring in music industry and a member of the USC College Republicans, said the event was a shining example of encouraging a diversity of opinions on campus.
“What our club has been trying to promote is giving the opportunity for any of these speakers, even if we disagree with them, to give them the freedom to speak their views,” Dubbery said. “So far it’s been collaborative, positive thought as to what is happening here promoting freedom of speech for these events for everyone involved, including those who disagree with us.”
Several other students, even those who did not agree with Coulter’s political views, were also appreciative of the pundit’s strong opinions.
Sameer Suri, a sophomore majoring in communication and creative writing, captured the spirit of the love-hate relationship many students said they felt toward Coulter.
“I don’t agree with her, but how can you not love a woman who writes a column called ‘Attack France!’ and closes it with the line, ‘What are they going to do? Fight us?,’” Suri asked.

Did she refer to the president as “Mr. Obama” or “B. Hussein?”
Bill Maher visited USC about 6 weeks ago: his Daily Trojan piece talked about his quick wit, his brutal honesty, and his social consciousness that speaks the truth.
Ann Coulter visits USC this past weekend: her Daily Trojan piece talks about her polarization of politics, her controversial satire, and how everyone disagrees with her but it’s free speech so we’ll tolerate it reluctantly.
Why treat people so differently?
Ann Coulter is at the top of the list for what is wrong in this country politically. She is a hate monger to
the nth degree.
I can agree with very little of what Ann Coulter says or writes. But I am proud of my fellow Trojans for not heckling her, acting rudely, or ruining the experience for those who wanted to hear her. Doubtless her audience included some supporters and some strongly against her positions, yet who still wanted to hear her points, even if not acceptable points to them. Well done, USC students!

The U.S.-Mexico Foundation’s Mexican American Leadership Initiative honored former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with their Hermandad award, which honors someone who has worked to strengthen relations between the United States and Mexico, Saturday morning at USC’s Town and Gown Ballroom.
Leadership · Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accepts an award from the Mexican American Leadership Initiative on Saturday. – Yasmeen Serhan | Daily Trojan
“From time to time on the horizon of American history, there appears a leader whose depth of understanding, whose proven experience and whose untiring dedication makes that leader precisely the right person for the time,” former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros said when introducing Clinton. “Such a person is Senator, first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and such a time is now.”
This was the third annual award ceremony for MALI, an initiative Clinton said she had a small role in helping to launch as secretary of state.
Many prominent political figures were in attendance at the sold-out brunch, including United States Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson, former Los Angeles Councilwoman Jan Perry, former United States Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and Mayor of San Antonio Julian Castro.
After opening remarks by the event co-chairs, a short video on what the U.S-Mexico Foundation does and a performance by Latin Grammy-nominated band Trio Ellas, Clinton delivered the main address of the evening, during which she discussed her relationship with the Latino-American community and emphasized the power of minorities within the United States.
“The strength of the United States, by having this broad diaspora of people from literally around the world, struck me as secretary as one of our greatest assets that we are undervaluing,” Clinton said.
The speech also became politically charged at some parts as Clinton touched on controversial issues. For instance, Clinton discussed the importance of embracing immigrants in the United States.
“Part of the obvious argument for immigration reform is that we are a country of immigrants and we should be celebrating that rather than fearing it,” she said.
Speculation of a 2016 presidential run for Clinton was also rife among attendees.
“I’m always so impressed with her,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) told the Daily Trojan. “I think that [Hillary Clinton] is a woman with experience that no one else has: first lady of a state, first lady of a country, U.S. senator where I served with her and she was a great leader, and I believe our next president.”
After Clinton’s speech, brunch was served and Monica Lozano, publisher and CEO of La Opinión, moderated a discussion between Cisneros and former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez on Mexican-American relations.
USC, which Cisneros referred to as a “lifelong friend of the American-Latino community,” was also recognized for its contributions to Hispanic-American relationships. Attention was specifically brought to the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a program that prepares local low-income middle school and high school students for college.
“I’ve been to many, probably hundreds of universities across the country and I’ve never seen anything like [the NAI],” Cisneros said. “It’s the best example for a university engaging with its minority community in the neighborhoods immediately surrounding it … It’s truly amazing; I commend it. [Clinton] recommended I tell you about it.”
Steve Kay, dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, pointed out that USC is also involved in researching immigration issues through the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.
“When we talk about being a leader of the Pacific Rim, we’re not only looking west, we’re also looking south,” Kay told the Daily Trojan. “And, to really be a leader in the Pacific Rim is to embrace binational and international relationships with Mexico and Latin America.”
Lozano, who is also a USC trustee, pointed out three things USC is doing to build relationships with the Latino community: working with neighborhood schools and making sure people have access to USC, recruiting students from USC’s office in Mexico and having academically strong programs that focus on the U.S.-Mexico relationship.
“USC is so well positioned in that it has embraced its relationship to Los Angeles and the fact that Latinos in Los Angeles are clearly the majority and growing … I think it is taking advantage of that position in ways that no other university is,” Lozano told the Daily Trojan.
