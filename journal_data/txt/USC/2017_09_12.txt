The Undergraduate Student Government passed a proposal Tuesday night to modify the phone numbers printed on the back of USCards for future USC students at the USG Senate meeting. By virtue of an amendment proposed by Speaker Pro Tempore Tyler Matheson, the amendment, which passed 9-3, includes three numbers: the Department of Public Safety emergency number, the Crisis Intervention Center and the USC 4-1-1 hotline.
Currently, USCards have two phone numbers: Undergraduate Student Government and an inoperational emergency line. USG said its intent behind the proposal was to use the space to provide much-needed guidance to students in need of urgent assistance.
The Crisis Intervention Center number and the USC 4-1-1 hotline are both still in the making and not currently functional, which caused many senators to ask questions and express concerns before voting on the amendment.
The Senate discussed the USC 4-1-1 hotline at length, as it was not yet known if the hotline would be automated or answered by human responders. Sens. Isabella Smith and Noah Silver asserted that this contingency could sway their opinions regarding the amendment from two numbers to three numbers. 
“If [USC 4-1-1] was an automated number, I would rather have all three of them on there,” Smith said. 
This turned out to be the broader opinion of the Senate, and the amendment and proposal were both passed with the understanding that the 4-1-1 hotline will be an automated number.
Dunn said that the USC 4-1-1 hotline and the Crisis Intervention number could be sources of confusion, because they will cover a variety of topics and concerns.
Sen. Buck Andrews brought up the distinction between physical and mental emergencies, and how it may be unclear as to which number students should call in each case. Dunn acknowledged the potential issue of differentiating between the two.
“That’s my only concern,” Dunn said. “I just don’t know if all of our students are going to know that Crisis Prevention means mental; DPS Emergency means physical.”

Photo from Joan Schaefer’s website
Last week, the USC community lost a member of the Trojan Family known iconically as “Dean Joan,” who has been described as a beacon for students seeking advice, a listening ear and a genuine friend.
Joan Metcalf Schaefer, who served as USC’s Dean of Women Emerita from 1955 to 1992, died on Sept. 3. She was 95.
Schaefer had an open-door policy, and welcomed walk-ins from all students, including many men. Those who sat in her office describe having “instant chemistry” in their first interactions with Schaefer.
She kept in touch with many former students, spending holidays and dinners with their families, alumnus and Schaefer’s longtime friend Jerry Papazian said. After retiring from her official position, Schaefer spent another 20 years at USC counseling groups like the Mortar Board national honor society and served on the executive board of Phi Beta Kappa, according to Papazian. She also began taking over 30 students to a summer program at the University of Cambridge in England each year.
Papazian met Schaefer in 1975 when he was a student working a summer job on campus. He walked by Schaefer’s office every day and became close friends with her. The two remained in touch long after Papazian graduated. 
“She was a classy, vibrant person you could talk to about anything at all,” Papazian said. “After speaking with her for a couple of minutes, you feel like you had known her your entire life.”
In 1992, Papazian worked with other former students to raise money for the Dean Joan Metcalf Schaefer Scholarships awarded through the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. The scholarship has an endowment of almost $2 million and is awarded annually in the spring.
Papazian added that Schaefer was an icon and role model for many female students. 
“She encouraged many alumni of the University to go and become doctors and lawyers when there really wasn’t that kind of support at the time,” Papazian said. 
Schaefer also encouraged students to pursue their dreams, Papazian said, by challenging their ideas and making them better people. 
Papazian said a memorial is being planned on campus for later this fall. 
Dean Joan was the spiritual head of the Trojan Family. Current administration should strive to keep the attitude and approach she had toward all students alive and thriving. Dean Joan is THE definition of The Trojan Family. So alumni have a very special place in our hearts for Dean Joan.

On the 16th anniversary of the Sept. 11, attacks, members of the USC community gathered for a discussion titled, “A Russian Jewish Kid from Shanghai takes on the American President.”
The talk featured Laurence Tribe, an author, attorney and professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School. Tribe’s former pupils and research assistants at Harvard include former President Barack Obama, Chief Justice John Roberts, Associate Justice Elena Kagan, Chief Judge Merrick Garland and Sen. Ted Cruz. He has also spoken dozens of times before Congress and the Supreme Court. 
Robert Shrum, a USC professor and longtime Democratic political consultant, hosted the discussion as a part of the Carmen and Louis Warschaw Distinguished Lecture series. The conversation focused on Tribe’s Jewish identity, legal history and feelings about the current administration.
Tribe began his opening remarks by connecting the political and historical significance of the 9/11 attacks to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
“I couldn’t help seeing and hearing that date through a lens that I had previously reserved only for Dec. 7, 1941, the date that FDR rightly said would live in infamy,” Tribe said in reference to 9/11. 
He explained how these tragic events laid the groundwork for overreach from the government’s surveillance and military sectors. He also briefly mentioned that he felt concern for this same kind of governmental overreach in the 2016 presidential election.
In remembrance of the 9/11 attacks, Tribe recalled acting ready to undergo a root canal operation the moment the first plane hit the North Tower. He recalled the emotion he felt as everyone watched the television in the doctor’s waiting room.
“I knew, as I think just about everybody did, that we were at war,” Tribe said. 
He then recalled the critical moments of his upbringing that led to a career in law defending what he considers humanitarian causes. He cited his early years in Shanghai, where he was born and lived until he moved to San Francisco at the age of 5. He found two near-death moments of his own to be especially critical: the bombing of Shanghai by American forces and Germany’s failed deal to kill all Jewish people in Shanghai.
“I clearly recall as if it were very recent, the sound, the tremor, the smell of smoke, of the explosions and the heat of the dust as the houses to our immediate right and left were demolished by American bombs,” Tribe said. “Ours somehow was spared.”
Shrum then went on to recall his history with Tribe, sharing an anecdote of a trip to Israel they took together in 1981. Shrum said that this trip helped him understand Tribe’s appreciation for his Jewish roots.
“I remember how moved you were as our plane touched down,” Shrum said. “I never thought of you as that conscious of your Jewish roots, and that day was amazing. You kissed the ground.” 
Tribe confirmed the value of this trip to his spirituality. He said that after a lifetime of watching his fellow Jews ostracized, the existence of a safe place like Israel was moving to him. 
Tribe then discussed his legal career, specifically how his background in mathematics informs his legal philosophy and his two most significant cases before the Supreme Court.
He said that having a knowledge of math and physics is handy in law, exploring this concept in 1989 with a research assistant named Barack Obama in a paper entitled, “The Curvature of Constitutional Space: What Lawyers Can Learn From Modern Physics.” 
“With Obama’s help, I tried to show our insensitivity to the way that people can be harmed by the whole shape of the legal system, not by any one cop punching about,” Tribe said. “They can be harmed by rules that say if you hear a kid crying out at home, let legal services handle it.”
He also claimed that his two most memorable cases were his first case and Bush v. Gore. To finish the conversation, he elaborated on Bush v. Gore, saying that he believed the result was much more complicated than an act of partisanship.
“I do not, however, agree with Alan Dershowitz and a lot of other law professors that the court was acting purely out of partisan whim,” Tribe said. “I think it was a lousy opinion, but I’m not ready to say the court is a bunch of political hacks.”

The Annenberg Digital Lounge offers a collaborative, digital space for all students at USC beyond the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. The lounge aims to provide students with the opportunity to learn professional programs in order to embrace technology in an environment that encourages experimentation. Different courses and workshops are offered at the lounge, and its first workshop, “Creative Resume Techniques with Adobe InDesign,” will be held on Wednesday. 
As more employers begin seeking out students with digital skills, creative media manager Erika Hang encourages students to utilize the lounge that was created through the digital literacy initiative implemented by former Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III. 
“Our team and our space was born out of the idea of giving Annenberg students digital skills,” Hang said. “Our main goal is being able to offer workshops and software support for a lot of the tools that the students are using.”
The lounge tries to improve itself each semester, collecting feedback from students to see what skills and workshops would pique their interest. 
“Starting last semester, we’ve been offering more data analytical stuff,” Hang said. 
This fall, the Digital Lounge has included data analytics in their new line-up of programming that includes classes on creative media and personal branding. 
“We’re trying to always stay up on what’s new, what students want to learn and what’s current,” Hang said. “There’s just so many avenues to get digital skills here and if you can’t take a 10-week course, you can always take a workshop. [We’re] just trying to foster that creativity.” 
The lounge still maintains its 10-week Adobe certification courses, although they are only offered to Annenberg students or students taking an Annenberg course. But the year-round workshops non-Annenberg students can attend also offer useful skills that are transferable to future job opportunities, according to Hang. 
“We’re trying to support anything that students are using in the classroom or students would find valuable when they go out to look for a job,” Hang said. “A lot more jobs out there are looking for students with digital skills or it’s a bonus if you know Photoshop, or a bonus if you know coding.”
Workshops teach students techniques in topics such as creating better motion graphics, building brands, retouching photos and starting impactful podcasts. 
Many of the courses are held in the Instructional Media Lab and taught by instructors like Rick Miller, a former Adobe senior solutions engineer for education who is teaching this semester’s Adobe Premiere, InDesign and Photoshop courses. 
“Having an Adobe Associates Certification sets [students] apart from other people who are vying for the same job,” Miller said. “Having this skillset is going to help them immensely because they can take this creative media and work with it in a way that is easy to be consumed at the endpoint.”
The Digital Lounge also offers services through its Help Desk, run by students who are experienced with the different programs. 
“All of the Digital Lounge employees have different specializations in these programs so students can come here for any kind of help they need on assignments,” said Michelle Whang, a media support specialist and junior communications student. “The lounge is a safe environment for students to come in and work on their creative endeavor. It’s a creative makerspace here.”
The “Bring Your Own Device” policy implemented at Annenberg in 2014 aimed to encourage digital literacy by allowing students to use technology in the classroom. Similarly, the courses and workshops held at the Digital Lounge encourage this type of customization in students’ workspaces to foster creativity and learning. 
“Creativity is the cornerstone behind the idea of the Digital Lounge,” Whang said. “It’s not like a traditional classroom setting, but what the students make of it.”

Gin Wong, trustee and architect of many Southern California buildings, died Sept. 1 in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 94.
Wong was born in Guangzhou, China, and received a degree from the USC School of Architecture. 
“Gin Wong was a visionary architect who left an indelible mark on our beloved alma mater and our vibrant southern California landscape,” President C. L. Max Nikias told USC News. “He was also an exemplary Trojan who was always looking forward to his next endeavor.”
Wong helped design the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the USC City Center in downtown Los Angeles.
Wong’s company Gin Wong Associates helped restore USC’s original building, which became the Widney Alumni House after Wong completed the restoration in 1977.
Gin Wong is survived by his wife, Louise Wong; children, Terrina, Janna and Kimberlee; and four grandchildren, three of whom attended USC. 
Memorial services for Wong will be private, but Wong’s family has requested that in lieu of flowers, funds be donated to the Gin Wong Scholarship at the USC School of Architecture.
How does one give to the Scholarship? The office of development was not helpful and there is only a link on the website to the general scholarship fund.
