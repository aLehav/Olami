Over 100 people were in attendance for the environmental forum on Wednesday hosted by the Environmental Student Assembly and the Office of Sustainability to discuss green efforts implemented by the University and future endeavors. 
The forum discussed the 2020 Sustainability Plan, which focused on water, waste, transportation and engagement efforts. The presenters also focused on future sustainability efforts to be implemented on the Row and zero-waste tailgating, composting and recycling across campus. 
Ellen Dux, the associate director for the Office of Sustainability, also discussed the University’s future goals with its 2028 sustainability plan to continue the agenda established in 2020 but on a more “aggressive” scale. The goals for sustainability efforts are still being formulated. 
“We want to be moving to where our city is going, if not even faster than where our city is going,” Dux said. “In these early stages, nothing is off the table. Anybody who’s interested in what’s happening with sustainability in this campus has a way to have their opinion.”
Isabella Caltabiano and Lauren Pearson, the director and assistant director of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Sustainability Affairs, presented USG’s sustainability efforts, including getting more compost and recycling bins in student and Greek life housing.
Sustainability Affairs also plans to invite a new vendor to McCarthy Quad farmer’s markets that would offer free refills of shampoo, laundry detergent, conditioner and various other beauty and hygiene products. 
“This would be purchasing a reusable bottle once and then when you’re done with your shampoo, being able to go to these refill stations and just keeping that same exact bottle, so you would never have to continuously throw out your recyclable bottles,” Pearson said.
One audience member brought up concern with fossil fuel endowments — specifically investments made by college administrations to fossil fuels instead of clean energy efforts. Dux said the University’s 2028 Sustainability Plan will not concern itself with this effort, but that various groups are working on addressing this. 
Julia Desantis, a sophomore studying communications, was concerned with how the question was addressed during the forum and whether this will have an effect on the transparency of administrative funds and sustainability efforts in the future. 
“It kind of contradicts the whole idea of being sustainable … Especially if the tone of the campaign is transparency and collaboration, I think it’s definitely something that needs to be on the table,” Desantis said.
The forum also discussed the results from the 2020 planning survey. Only 519 responses were recorded from students, staff, faculty, and alumni with 63% of those surveyed displaying interest in sustainability efforts on campus, but most were not aware of current initiatives on campus.  
President Carol Folt’s inauguration, which advertised a zero-waste initiative that essentially meant diverting at minimum 90% of waste from landfills, produced in total a 95% diversion at HSC overall. The University hopes to continue these efforts in future projects, such as through the zero-waste tailgate initiative.
The tailgate initiative plans to divert the 7 to 15 tons of average landfill waste created by implementing compost and recycling bins in some closed tailgates with student ambassadors to educate those attending. This initiative started at a previous tailgate and will be implemented again at the Homecoming game. The Office of Sustainability hopes to expand the effort to the entire campus in the future. 
The goals for the 2028 Sustainability Plan are set to be completed and sent for administrative approval by early next year,
The Sustainability Steering Committee, comprised of students, faculty and staff will create these goals, which are still being formulated but is set to be released to administrative officials early next year.

USC IDEAS Movement, an organization that supports undocumented students and those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, unveiled a banner near Tommy Trojan Wednesday that read “Fight on 4 DACA #HomeIsHere” to stand in solidarity with DACA recipients across the country.
More than 50 banner drops were held at campuses across California ahead of a Supreme Court decision next month that will determine whether DACA — a policy that was implemented by former President Barack Obama in 2012 to protect people who immigrated to the U.S. when they were children from deportation — will be allowed to continue. 
Melody Klingenfuss, the California Dream Network State organizer with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, said the event helps spread awareness before Nov. 12, when the Supreme Court will begin the judicial review of the Trump administration to end DACA.
She has worked on mobilizing other campuses, such as LA Trade Tech, UC Davis and UC Merced.
“We got so lucky that we got to activate USC on Monday, and they jumped right on,” said Klingenfuss, who graduated from the Price School of Public Policy in 2017. “USC IDEAS came out full-force with their members.” 
She emphasized that getting students to talk about and engage in immigrant rights is essential for humanizing DACA recipients. 
“We don’t want our parents to be criminalized, we’re here as human beings,” she said. “DACA is just the first layer of the cake. Our ultimate goal is still immigration reform.”
Kimberly Alvarado, assistant director of the IDEAS Movement, helped organize the event and hopes that it helped educate more students on the issues facing those with DACA status. Alvarado, a senior majoring in social sciences, said she thought it was important to bring awareness to an issue that most USC students are not exposed to. 
“A lot of the people who attend USC are not Latinos, are not immigrants, [so we’re here to] bring awareness to that, that there are people in their classes that have DACA or have family members that have DACA,” she said.                           
Jose Hernandez, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry, is a vocal supporter of DACA students and heard about the event through a Latinx Student Assembly meeting. 
“I just thought it would be nice to come out and support like other students that were with them,” Hernandez said. “I feel like with this banner, students should be more aware of the uncertainty that comes with being undocumented … like waiting for someone else to decide what should happen.” In that future, Hernandez hopes that legislation can help improve the lives of undocumented students. 
Miguel Moran, a sophomore majoring in applied and computational mathematics, said he hopes that USC students will support their peers who hold DACA status, especially as the Supreme Court is set to decide their fate next month. 
“It’ll help uplift the students because obviously, people’s livelihoods are at risk right now, so I guess coming out to support in events like this gives people a sort of sense of relief,” Moran said.  
Klingenfuss said IDEAS welcomes both undocumented students and U.S. citizens and encourages students from all backgrounds to come together and support their peers who have DACA status. 
“We need U.S. citizens to step up and use their privilege as citizens of this country to defend folks that are being oppressed by this administration,” she said. “That’s the easiest way to get involved.”

We’re reaching the halfway point of the college football season. Before we know it, we’ll have to pretend to care about esports or something, as fellow columnist Sam Arslanian keeps urging us to. Enjoy all the upsets, shootouts and rivalries that college football has to offer while you can. 
If there’s one positive thing about college football reaching its midpoint, it’s that I get to highlight the players most likely to break out and define the College Football Playoff race as we plow toward December.
Every year, injuries — or sudden transfers — thrust unproven players into action. In the 2017 season, it was then-freshman Tua Tagovailoa, who came off the bench to lead Alabama to a win over Georgia in the National Championship. Last season, it was the emergence of a pair of underclassmen Clemson receivers in Tee Higgins and Justyn Ross. 
In years past, some of my predictions have been spot on (Notre Dame’s Miles Boykin and Ohio State’s Dre’Mont Jones last year), and I’ve missed on others (404 error, page not found). So without further ado, here’s a player on each top 10 team most likely to make headlines and define the title picture down the stretch. Some are underclassmen; others are veterans who have stayed under the radar until now. Either way, I’m sure that all of my predictions will be correct this time around. 
1. Alabama senior safety Jared Mayden
Alabama has dealt with several injuries in the front seven and currently fields one of the youngest linebacker corps in the SEC. The Crimson Tide secondary has picked up the slack, intercepting six passes. Mayden has been the most consistent member of the unit, with one interception and 20 tackles so far this season.
2. Clemson freshman defensive tackle Tyler Davis
After three Clemson defensive linemen were picked in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft, most thought the unit would experience a major drop-off compared to last season. That hasn’t happened — in large part due to Davis, who has posted edge rusher numbers (two and a half sacks) in a run-stuffer’s frame (6-foot-2, 295 pounds). I have no idea how Clemson keeps finding these versatile guys. 
3. Georgia redshirt freshman linebacker Azeez Ojulari
Azeez “The Disease” Ojulari has provided Georgia’s defense with the disruptiveness it lacked last season. So far, he leads the team with three and a half sacks and a ridiculously high 19 quarterback pressures. Plus, he has a killer nickname to boot. Redshirt freshman running back Zamir “Zeus” White would have gotten the nod here if the Bulldogs’ backfield wasn’t so loaded.
4. Ohio State junior linebacker Baron Browning
Defensive end Chase Young is the Buckeyes’ most dominant defender, and Browning has taken full advantage of the attention Young receives. When Young starts getting double teamed by superior opponents down the stretch, Browning will be there to pick up the pieces. So far, he has six tackles for a loss and two and a half sacks despite playing primarily on the inside. This relationship isn’t unlike what Young had with Nick Bosa the last three seasons. 
5. LSU sophomore wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase
Chase has been a catalyst in LSU’s new-look offense, leading the team with 19.6 yards per catch. A quarter of his receptions have gone for touchdowns, and he notched 147 yards against Texas in the Tigers’ biggest win to date.
6. Oklahoma sophomore wide receiver Charleston Rambo
The Sooners’ opponents key in on junior wide receiver CeeDee Lamb on the outside for good reason, but Rambo might actually be the team’s most talented receiver. He’s averaging an absurd 27.4 yards per reception in Lincoln Riley’s Air Raid scheme.
7. Florida sophomore tight end Kyle Pitts
Regardless of who has been the quarterback for the Gators, Pitts has been the team’s steady pass-catching presence. He was essential in the team’s win over Auburn last week, hauling in eight catches for 65 yards. Pitts is also the Gator’s most versatile offensive weapon with his ability to line up inside or out wide. 
8. Wisconsin sophomore linebacker Jack Sanborn
Junior running back Jonathan Taylor deserves all the hype for leading the Badgers to an unexpected 5-0 start, but Sanborn has been nearly as dominant on defense. He does it all, leading the team with 28 tackles, notching three sacks and returning an interception for 39 yards. Not bad for a first-year starter.
9. Notre Dame junior tight end Cole Kmet
Kmet saved the biggest game of his career for a massive stage, recording nine catches for 108 yards in a hard-fought road loss to Georgia. He’ll be the key to the Fighting Irish’s efforts to return to a New Year’s Six Bowl or even the Playoff (but hopefully not) just based on the security he provides for senior quarterback Ian Book. 
10. Penn State freshman running back Devyn Ford
The Nittany Lions have flown under the radar this season. So too has Ford — the next great Penn State running back in a recent lineage that includes Saquon Barkley and Miles Sanders. Ford is averaging 7.6 yards per carry and has gotten more involved in the passing game as the season has progressed. 
Bonus: USC redshirt freshman running back Markese Stepp
Good things have happened when Stepp has touched the ball. He’s averaging 6.4 yards per carry and has scored a touchdown or gained a first down on 52% of his carries, according to Pro Football Focus. The problem? He hasn’t been getting enough touches, averaging just five carries per game. The game at Notre Dame this weekend would be the ideal time to let the Indiana native and former Irish recruit loose with 15 to 20 carries.

Two hundred and eighty-five miles.
That is the distance fifth-year doctoral candidate Jess Zaiss swam, biked and ran two weekends ago when she became the first woman to successfully complete back-to-back Ironman races.
Despite playing five high school sports — volleyball, basketball, softball, track and cheer — in her hometown of Jasper, Mo., Zaiss, who is studying geological sciences, never thought she would attempt such a feat. 
Her first triathlon came eight years ago during her last year as an undergraduate — a triathlon “sprint” which consisted of a half-mile swim, 12-mile bike ride and three-mile run. At the time, Zaiss confessed she could barely run the three miles. She ultimately got lost during the race and finished dead last. 
Still, Zaiss was proud of completing her first triathlon attempt and called her aunt after the race, who quickly brought up Ironman competitions.
“I was so mad that she couldn’t just have this moment with me,” Zaiss said. “I was like, ‘You know what? Fine. I’m going to do an Ironman someday.’”
That initial race was in 2011. Over the ensuing years, Zaiss trained and regularly competed in triathlons. In 2015, she began her doctoral studies at USC and joined a local Los Angeles Triathlon club called LA Tri. 
Ironman competitions consist of a 2.4-mile swim followed by a 112-mile bike ride and end with a 26.2-mile run. Zaiss had already competed in three Ironman races by 2019, so when a fellow competitor suggested that she consider participating in the Ultraman — a three-day race consisting of a 6.2-mile swim and 92-mile bike ride on Day 1, a 171-mile bike ride on Day 2 and a double marathon on Day 3 — Zaiss embraced the challenge.
In order to prepare for the event next year, Zaiss decided to compete in two back-to-back Ironman competitions in September.
The plan was as follows: Zaiss would fly to Nashville, Tenn. on Sept. 25 before driving 755 miles to Cambridge, Md. to compete in Ironman Maryland that Saturday. Following that first race, Zaiss and her team would drive 690 miles to Chattanooga, Tenn., where she would immediately begin another Ironman competition. 
Despite months of preparation, Zaiss admits it was difficult to settle her nerves as she lined up to begin the first race in Maryland. 
“I was nervous,” Zaiss said. “I was actually cool and collected all morning, which was surprising to me. And then once they did the countdown and the athletes started getting in the water, that’s when I got a bit nervous just because I knew as soon as I stepped foot into that water, I knew that the weekend was officially underway, and there [were] 285 miles [looming] in front of me.”
Once she entered the water, Zaiss fought through a strong current and encountered several jellyfish before finishing the swim and embarking on the 112-mile bike ride and marathon run. Even though Zaiss ended the race within the cutoff time, she did not feel optimistic heading back to Tennessee for her second Ironman. 
“I was actually very scared,” Zaiss said. “Maryland, I thought, was supposed to be an easier course, and I kept my effort low, but there was a ton of wind on the bike. In order to make the [8:30 p.m.] cutoff that I needed to make, I had to push a little harder than I thought I would.”
Soon after crossing the finish line, Zaiss drove with friends overnight to Chattanooga, arriving at 7:10 a.m. on just four hours of sleep.
Just as she did the day before, Zaiss lined up to begin what would be over 140 miles of racing. After finishing the swim, she persevered through the race’s 116-mile bike ride. 
“On the bike, I was in survival mode, and I saw so many cyclists on the side of the road not finishing,” Zaiss said. “Four hundred athletes didn’t make it off the bike alone, and I didn’t want to be one of those statistics.”
After the bike ride, a mentally and physically exhausted Zaiss moved on to the race’s marathon portion. Twenty-six point two miles later, she finished her second Ironman competition in two days, becoming the first woman to do so.
Although she is pleased with her record-breaking achievement, Zaiss said she is most proud of the mental and physical strength she showed over the course of the two races. 
“I don’t actually really think about [the record] if I’m going to be honest with you,” Zaiss said. “More what I think about is the fact that I set this goal to do this really hard thing, and I did it. More than that, I just think back to that morning at Chattanooga, and I’ve never been so intimidated by a race … I stepped to the starting line shaking in my boots, and I still stepped forward. I think that’s what I’m the most proud of.”
Zaiss also hopes her achievement can serve as a source of inspiration for others.
“That feeling of facing your fears head on and overcoming a hard obstacle — [no other feeling beats it],” Zaiss said. “I just really encourage everyone to sign up for something that scares you. If that’s a 5k run, great, do it. Face that head on. You can do hard things.”

In the two weeks since its loss to Washington, USC’s defense has taken time to get healthy and prepare for the toughest opponent on its schedule: No. 9 Notre Dame.
Sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga was proven to be irreplaceable when a concussion kept him on the sidelines against the Huskies. The Trojans’ defense struggled to fill his position, compiling just two sacks for five yards and no interceptions.
“You can see in [Hufanga’s] play he leads by example,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “He loves to do whatever it takes to be a good football player, and he’s demonstrated that this year.”
The Trojans will need that leadership if they expect to contain Notre Dame’s versatile offense. In its 52-0 shutout over Bowling Green last week, the Fighting Irish’s senior quarterback Ian Book accrued 340 yards for five touchdowns. Notre Dame’s backfield also racked up 233 rushing yards, rounding out a capable play-making unit.
“They’re very diverse in what they do,” Pendergast said. “They obviously have a very good [run-pass option] game with quick combinations outside and all the different formations … The quarterback sees the field really well and he knows the system and operates at a very high level.”
USC’s defense has worked on diversifying its playbook, maintaining a fortified line while covering the field’s periphery. This unit has struggled throughout the season with giving opposing quarterbacks too much time, which won’t bode well against Book and his talented skill players.
Pendergast’s group is also focusing on another historically weak point: making adjustments. USC struggles on both sides of the ball with modifying its plan mid-game, often causing late-game deficits following early leads. Against unpredictable competitors like Notre Dame, the Trojans will need to switch it up in order to keep the Irish from figuring out their strategy.
Defensive line coach Chad Kauha’aha’a has faith that USC’s defense can keep Notre Dame on its toes. 
“If I thought we weren’t a group that could handle quick adjustments like this, we wouldn’t do it,” Kauha’aha’a said. “But these guys can handle it…we made one little tweak which is easy for these guys to handle, and we’ll move forward.”
Hufunga’s re-entry into the starting lineup should bring the discipline and toughness necessary to contain Notre Dame. Though he still wore a non-contact jersey at Wednesday’s practice, he’s expected to step up and lead the secondary Saturday.
“Oh, it’s huge,” said Christian Rector, a redshirt senior defensive lineman, of Hufanga’s presence on the field. “It really boosts the confidence of the defense. He’s a great tackler in space, so that’s a guy we can rely on to come up big.”
With the rivalry hype, Hufanga is staying humble and sticking to his assignments.
“It’s going to be my first time out there, [getting] to experience the stadium, the culture, the lifestyle,” he said. “For us to go out there and try to win, that’s our goal.”
Win or lose, Hufanga’s main priorities are to stay healthy and mentor his teammates on the field. As the leader of this young defense, he looks to keep everyone on track not only against Notre Dame, but through the rest of the season.
“To get back on the field and just play around with my brothers, it’s a great opportunity,” Hufanga said. “I’m just excited to be back.”

As USC continues to expand and  add new majors and minors, such as the recently announced minor in health innovation, the University should consider adding a fashion program, as well. Fashion is a vast area of study that can be explored across other disciplines like merchandising, business, design and marketing. 
Although the Roski School of Art and Design offers a couple of courses in fashion design (Graphic Design in Fashion is the only Roski course offered this semester), students would benefit from the addition of a comprehensive fashion industry program. 
The fashion industry has a significant role to play in the national and global economy. According to the Joint Economic Committee, fashion is a $2.3 trillion global industry. In the United States alone, consumers spent over $380 billion on apparel and footwear in 2017, and New York Fashion Week even has a greater annual economic impact upon the United States ($600 million) than the Super Bowl ($347 million). 
It seems obvious that USC would have a clear interest in providing its students with the tools to work in whatever industry they desire, especially one as lucrative as the fashion industry.  
While New York City is recognized as the United States’ hub for fashion, there is room for contributions from California to the industry as well. 
The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and Otis College of Art and Design are two hubs of fashion study in the Los Angeles area. However, neither school offers intersections of the industry with programs as strong as what USC could offer, like a joint program in fashion journalism through the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism or business of the fashion industry through the Marshall School of Business. Meanwhile, the undergraduate BA/BFA Roski programs are ranked No. 1 in the nation for design and No. 7 for art schools, outranking both FIDM and Otis. 
Also unlike FIDM and Otis, students interested in studying fashion at USC would be able to do so in a more traditional university setting rather than at an arts college. FIDM and Otis are small art schools enrolling less than 3,000 students each. 
Other universities like USC don’t offer fashion programs either. Maybe a fashion program is the type of edge that could distinguish USC from UCLA or UC Berkeley in the rankings, all while reinforcing the school’s ability to provide students with interdisciplinary study across a variety of schools and greater variety of study offered in the arts. Additionally, a fashion program that prepares students to work in the industry would only make USC students more competitive than UCLA or UC Berkeley graduates in the job market. 
A program at USC could establish its uniqueness by taking on the sustainable and environmentally conscious clothing culture now sported by many California brands, something that isn’t as prioritized by the New York fashion scene. With growing concern over the environmental impact of the industry, many California-based brands, such as Reformation, Patagonia and Re/Done, have grown in popularity, proving that there even is room for environmental activism in fashion. USC has the resources to add to the movement, with programs offered in engineering and environmental sciences that can further advance the industry. 
USC prides itself on being an innovative university that pushes the boundaries of traditional disciplinary study. By providing schools and programs across many disciplines, the University encourages students to forge connections between their different interests. 
The study of fashion ideally builds upon this principle, as it pulls from so many different fields. An interest in fashion among USC students is already evident, from student-run fashion publications, like SPEC Magazine, to student-made clothing brands and clubs on campus. 
Ultimately, the establishment of a fashion program would serve students and the University, advancing both the arts at USC, as well as other fields of study that intersect with fashion.

At the beginning of this semester, USC Residential Education piloted a new program that provides free feminine hygiene products to residents in Cowlings and Ilium Residential College. This pilot is part of a sustained effort USG senators have been working toward for nearly three years. 
USG implemented the pilot after receiving positive feedback from the free condom initiative, which required resident assistants to supply condoms for on-campus student residents. In 2017, USG conducted a test run of the program outside of Engemann Health Center through which it offered 900 menstrual products over a three-day period. The trial was met with support of a permanent program. 
In January 2018, USG finally passed the resolution enabling free feminine hygiene products to be distributed on campus. However, this has not happened yet. While this action may seem progressive in nature, USC is not the first university to bring feminine hygiene products on its campus. In fact, the University is falling behind. This resolution is long overdue, and many other college campuses have already gone much further than USC. 
The University of Minnesota began offering free menstrual products on campus over a decade ago. When Brown University started stocking free tampons and pads in campus bathrooms — men, women and gender-neutral restrooms — in 2016, the program inspired many other campuses to do the same, sparking a new wave of college cultural reforms.   
For many female students, menstrual products are considered a necessity yet are taxed as a luxury in our country. Forty states still implement a tax on menstrual products, including California. A standard box of female hygienic products at Target in USC Village costs anywhere between $3 and $10. While it may not seem like much, the monthly cost of tampons and pads can add up to over $1,000 a year. Therefore, providing free and accessible feminine hygiene products on campus is beneficial for overall student wellness — physically, mentally and financially. 
For now, USC is only offering this privilege at one residential college: Cowlings and Ilium. Efforts toward expansion were stalled when the University’s custodial staff argued that their contract does not specify the handling of menstrual products. While the majority of the programs’ costs are not necessarily in relation to the products themselves, the costs of the packaging and maintenance can quickly add up, which serves as the University’s primary concern.
Brown University was able to offer an adequate solution to these production problems to successfully launch this initiative. According to Brown University’s Undergraduate Council of Students, they are the ones responsible for restocking and maintaining these items on a weekly basis. They believe that the benefit of this program greatly outweighs the technical concerns and are optimistic that it will expand to men’s restrooms in the future. 
Taking inspiration from Brown’s free on-campus feminine hygiene program, there’s no reason for USC to hesitate to make their program campus-wide. The free condom initiative was the University’s effort to promote safe sex and student health. It is time for the university to recognize the importance of female health and wellness as well, something that should have been addressed long ago. The positive student feedback from the 2017 trial ensures the success of a permanent program.

On Monday evening, audience members flooded Cammilleri Hall for Visions and Voices’ “WET: A DACAmented Journey,” a solo performance by Alex Alpharaoh in which one man’s words powerfully express his story as an undocumented American. 
“WET: A DACAmented Journey” is a theatrical performance that combines Spanish and English to share the true story of Anner Cividanis, Alex Alpharaoh’s birth name, and what it means to call a country home even when that country refuses to recognize you, marginalizes and attacks your livelihood. Alpharaoh was awarded Best Solo Performance for the show by the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle in 2018.
“When you’re undocumented, your whole life is fragmented, frustrated,” Alpharaoh proclaimed.
Alpharaoh vividly recounted what his distressed mother told him the very first time he asked about his legal status, prompted by teasing at school.
“You must never tell anyone that you don’t have papeles,” Alpharaoh said. “As far as anyone is concerned, I gave birth to all four of my kids in the United States. You have to be smart hijo because if they come for you, God forbid they come for me, then who is going to take care of your brothers and your sisters, huh? You have to be smart, Anner. Keep your head down and never draw any unnecessary attention to yourself.”
Fast-forwarding from his childhood in the 1980s, Alpharaoh describes the unending uncertainty undocumented people continuously face, from promising moments of hope during the Barack Obama era to widespread fear at the hands of the current administration.
In June 2012, the Obama administration established Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, providing some undocumented Americans who entered the country as children certain temporary protections.
“Those who were brought here as children, through no fault of our own, granting us the opportunity to call the United States our home,” is how Alpharaoh captured the hope DACA provided certain undocumented people like him.
Alpharaoh explains that DACA excitement is short-lived though, as, on Jan. 20, 2017, Donald Trump became president and began working to restrict immigration.
“If I have to go away to a place I have never stayed except for when I was a babe with no memory to be recollected,” Alpharaoh said. “Tossed out as if I were defective. How then is my departure constructed if my whole life can be relocated, decimated, dismantled? My whole dealings with a stroke of a pen. My livelihood should not have to depend on political trends.”
The performance then shifted toward Anner’s story of visiting Guatemala for the first time to see his dying grandfather.
“Guatemala is a beautiful place, but it’s not my home, it simply isn’t,” Alpharaoh said. “Now arriving to Guatemala was a huge cultural shock. It was the first time in my life that I had ever felt like an actual immigrant.”
To get to Guatemala in the first place, Anner had to deal with troubling government proceedings and wrestle with the idea that he may never be allowed to return to America after leaving, the only home he has ever known. After a close call, Anner was let back into America at LAX.
“I was allowed back into the country, but I’m still not fully welcome home,” Alpharaoh said.
Alpharaoh explained some history behind the show which was written in 2017 in response to Trump’s decision to phase out DACA and how things have escalated since.
“It’s not fair. It’s not fair that as a DACA recipient I have to plan my life in 2-year increments,” Alpharaoh said. “That every 18 months, I have to wait in line for a work permit that I may or may not get … Since the beginning of the 45th Administration, there have been constant attacks towards the undocumented community.”
“There are people that are trying to destroy our country: Pulse in Orlando; Las Vegas, Nev.; Dallas, Texas; Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Chicago, Ill.; Baltimore, Md.; New York City, N.Y.,” he continued. “There has been one mass shooting every single day since the beginning of the 45th’s administration and like I said I get it. There are people that are trying to destroy our country, but it’s not us, the DACAmented.”
Closing out the performance in Spanish, Alpharaoh shifted briefly to make one final declaration in English.
“Mi nombre es Anner Alexander Alfaro Cividanis,” he said. “I am an American in every sense of the word, except on paper. I’m a son to an American, brother to Americans, father to an American. I’m an actor, writer, director, producer, poet, social worker, friend. What I am not, is your enemy.”
A standing ovation ensued.

The way we consume cannabis has drastically evolved over the past couple decades. As the industry grows, CEOs, entrepreneurs and startup moguls are increasingly tapping into the innovative and technologically motivated market of weed. 
With features like temperature control, ways to track how much you smoke and an app complete with games, the PAX Era vaporizer is just one example of how digitally-driven cannabis is becoming, prompting adults to tell me, “This isn’t the shit we used to smoke.”
According to a study from the Journal of the American Medical Association, between 2015 and 2017, fewer Colorado teens were smoking weed and more were beginning to embrace edibles and vapes.
Similarly, a BDS Analytics article found that the popularity of vapes in California and Oregon increased. During the first quarter of 2018, vape sales comprised 80% and 69%, respectively, of those states’ concentrates markets.
The explanation for this growth? Weed vaporizers are user-friendly, portable and discreet since they produce little to no smell. Especially for adolescents in high school and college students, vaporizers are preferable to traditional methods of consumption.
It seems like a stoner’s dream. 
However, following a recent slew of respiratory illnesses from illicit THC-containing vape products, vaporizer sales have dropped. As of Oct. 3, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 1,080 cases in 48 states of “severe acute respiratory distress syndrome” as a result of vaping, according to Leafly. An estimated 20 people have died from the condition, which is similar to lipoid pneumonia, where fat particles enter the lungs. 
The problem mainly stems from the illegal and underground trade of unregulated THC vape cartridges, although one death in Oregon was linked to a vaporizer purchased at a legal cannabis shop. No California deaths or illnesses have been associated with legal store sales — only pop-up shops — according to Leafly.
After testing seized vape cartridges, New York investigators honed in on vitamin E acetate -— a thickener used in many illegal carts — and its derivatives as a primary cause for the respiratory injuries, according to Leafly. The oil — used to cheaply dilute vape oils without watering them down — can be safely taken as a pill or used on skin but is unsafe when inhaled. Other contaminants, such as heavy metals, pesticides and vegetable glycerin, among other oils, were also found in illicit carts. In the Oregon case, the legal vape cart contained vitamin E acetate, which was previously allowed in the state as an additive as long as it was listed as an ingredient.
Following the epidemic, states immediately launched a crackdown, with health officials subpoenaing vape pen additive makers, regulators demanding stores recall any suspicious products and state officials raiding unlicensed stores carrying untested vape carts.
Less than a week ago, the Food and Drug Administration, CDC and United States Department of Health and Human Services issued statements urging consumers to throw away THC vapes they bought off the street. But even legal industries have been blowing smoke for years, and safety issues surrounding mysterious additives and oils have plagued THC vape cartridges ever since they reached the market. 
According to Leafly, only 22% of the $52 billion cannabis industry is regulated and legal. Because of weed’s federal classification as a Schedule I substance, research has significantly lagged behind dab pens’ growing popularity. 
The underlying issues here — lack of government regulation, testing, research and federal oversight — are part of a bigger problem. 
It never should have gotten to this point. Irresponsible industries that cut corners and governments that couldn’t care less about the well-being and safety of consumers are to blame for these horrific incidents.
While licensed markets have more safety measures in place, such as testing, harmful additives are not yet banned in California, among other legal states. On Sept. 24, the California Department of Public Health told consumers to avoid all vaping, according to Leafly. If consumers are concerned, Leafly recommends sticking to flower, edibles, tinctures and other methods of cannabis consumption. Customers can also look up if a store is licensed on the California Bureau of Cannabis Control’s website.
However, the fact of the matter is that people are not going to stop using THC vapes. And they shouldn’t have to if they’re buying vape carts from licensed cannabis retailers. It’s up to state officials and the federal government to impose regulations on additive and vape cart industries — as they have for all industries. Legalization is supposed to legitimize cannabis, meaning that it should also set up protections for consumers through testing these legal products.
I’m not going to lie and tell you vaping poses no risk and that your dab pen is 100% free of contaminants because the reality is that we actually don’t know. It’s also safe to say that inhaling anything other than air is probably not the best for your lungs. 
To be blunt, I’m not going to discontinue using my dab pen until the FDA finally comes to its senses and imposes stricter regulations for many reasons: my PAX Era is convenient, easy to transport and does the job pretty effectively. 
Moreso, the only carts I’ve ever bought are from Bloom Farms, which adhere to strict testing regulations and have never used vitamin E acetate. Additionally, consumers like me can minimize the risks they face by researching which vape cart companies vet their products and checking the ingredients of the extracts sold at licensed retailers.

More than 30 Fluor Tower residents will be relocated to new temporary housing after the sixth floor flooded when a fire alarm and sprinklers were falsely set off Tuesday morning, according to D’Andre Coats, West Residential College senior staff director. Some students responded to the alarm, which was set off on the Latinx community floor of the residential college, with racist memes calling for the residents to be evicted. 
Clothes or Halloween decorations hanging from the sixth-floor sprinklers caused the fire alarm and sprinklers to go off just before 3:30 a.m., flooding the floor with 15 gallons of water per minute, Coats said. Floors below the sixth floor were also damaged by flooding, and residents weren’t allowed back into the building until about 5:30 a.m.
Coats said 32 students will be relocated to New North and South residential colleges for an estimated six to eight weeks because of water damage in Fluor. 
The University has not decided how or if students will be fined for the incident, but  Coats said he is currently focused on gathering students’ belongings and clearing rooms for them to move back in and be functioning students. 
“Whenever you have a significant amount of water that comes down, it ruins a lot of the dry wall and a lot of aspects of the structures, so we will have to do some significant demos and make sure the rooms are remodeled for our health and safety protocol,” Coats said.
Students posted memes about the incident on social media, making racist comments about the El Sol y La Luna residents that called for whoever set off the alarms and sprinklers to be evicted from the building.  
One meme featured the classic “Hellmo” picture, which shows “Sesame Street” character Elmo screaming while surrounded by flames. Below the picture was written: “There are enemies among us … it appears as though tamales were made improperly in suite 608.” Another meme featured “Spongebob” character Larry the Lobster and read “You can’t make tamales at 3 a.m. and then forget to turn off the microwave.” 
“They weren’t funny,” said Nataly Joseph, a freshman majoring in journalism who lives on the ninth floor of Fluor Tower. “And it spread false information because a girl in my class today was like ‘Yeah, I heard someone’s enchiladas burned.’ I was like ‘No, that’s a racial joke someone decided to make’ … It was low-hanging fruit as far as jokes go.”
Coates sent an email to the West Residential College community condemning the memes and said he would follow up with the students who made the posts. He also said that students could talk with their RAs or other building faculty if the posts made them uncomfortable.
“To the folks that the meme or the petition had a significant impact [on], know that you are a valued member of our community and that there is no room for racist rhetoric, jokes or content to exist in the environment we hope to create,” he wrote. 
Andrea Diaz, the resident assistant for the floor, was angered by the memes; however, she said she wasn’t surprised that students reacted like this because she said she is all too familiar with the privileged population that comes to USC with implicit and explicit biases, whether these biases come from how they were raised or if they were ingrained systemically. 
“I am not gonna normalize racist humor by brushing these memes off as not a big deal,” Diaz said. “The memes were irrelevant and inappropriate, especially when people are worried and concerned about the status of their housing.”
Diaz said she isn’t sure if the University can take any measures against the students who posted the memes but will continue to support her residents by advocating for measures and spaces that will protect them and other students of color on campus.
Other sixth floor residents declined to comment on the incident.

Undergraduate Student Government proposed a resolution at Tuesday’s meeting to continue its involvement in the Student Leadership Association of California, an organization of 15 student governments dedicated to collaboration between student leaders at universities.
 SLAC hosted a conference at UCLA Sunday with 51 student government representatives from 15 institutions, including USC, Stanford University, Occidental College and Pitzer College. Participants deliberated on administrative differences between student governments, issues of administrative transparency and efforts to increase student engagement, USG Senior Director of Communications Truman Fritz said.
Fritz, who acted as the interim chairman for the SLAC Board of Directors, said representatives also discussed formalizing SLAC as an association by instituting an ancillary organizational structure. USC, Occidental and Pitzer initially established SLAC in 2018 to connect student governments from across California and had 10 attendees at the first conference.
“As our mission mentions, it’s [important] to share best practices, share insights, and share things and problems and solutions that we found at other institutions that we can bring back home and really enhance the student experience here,” Fritz said. 
Sen. Emily Johnson said she appreciated learning about the different structures of the participating student governments during the conference. She was particularly interested in how  student governments are funded and the role the Senate branch plays within the academic institution. 
“It was very insightful to understand how they are structured and the influences that their overall institutions have on that, particularly like differences between public and private institutions,” Johnson said. 
Johnson also said she found herself reflecting on how to improve the way USG functions and learned about certain initiatives at different universities that could be implemented at USC.
“There’s certain things that UCLA was doing about sustainability or just in general [in] their campus climate that contrasted a lot from USC, either people being in general more well-informed or even we saw they have a way bigger budget for service organizations,” Johnson said. 
SLAC’s opportunities for collaboration have brought forth results in the past. In June, USC and UCLA representatives released a joint statement on campus sexual assault, which condemned the lack of transparency and accountability from administrators concerning incidents of sexual assault and reaffirmed their commitment to improving campus climate.
Student government leaders from USC, Stanford, UCLA and Yale, including USG President Trenton Stone, also co-authored an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times in August concerning their schools’ involvement in the college admissions scandal. The writers argued that there are systemic barriers to higher education that must be addressed to help less privileged students have equal opportunities.
SLAC will host another conference in January.
During the meeting, Sen. Hailey Robertson also tabled her proposed pro-consent reusable cup project, which she requested funding for at last week’s meeting. Robertson hopes to develop a more substantive campaign before presenting it to the Senate for a vote.
“We’re exploring other alternatives, like maybe getting other organizations involved, as well as creating a more cohesive campaign that can be more meaningful and impactful,” Robertson said.

When senior Sofia Bosch told a local stylist while getting a haircut that she was majoring in journalism, the woman burst into tears and told her about issues in the community that had gone uncovered by news outlets. 
“She pulls me aside, starts crying and was like, ‘I have been in this community for so long, and nobody cares,’” Bosch said. “‘The University keeps expanding; I feel very helpless. Nobody is helping the community, the people who’ve lived here forever can’t live here anymore because it’s too expensive, and they’re being bullied out of their neighborhood by private developers.’” 
Bosch spent months following hairdresser Aurora Becerra around the neighborhood to film a video for Intersections South L.A., a community reporting outlet under Annenberg Media. 
Becerra eventually approached Bosch about creating an organization to help the community, leading Bosch to decide she would stop covering the issues and instead actively work to address them. 
In November 2017, Bosch and Becerra officially founded the University Park Action Coalition, a community-based organization that attempts to bridge the communication gap between the community, USC and the city of Los Angeles.
“The primary, central goal is just to be a forum where the community can feel that they’re being heard,” Bosch said. “UPAC played a really important role in my love for grassroots community organizing and impact.” 
Thanks to her leadership in the organization, Bosch was selected to attend the Forbes Under 30 Summit at the end of the month, where she’ll meet 1,000 other students from across the country.
“More than anything else, I was really surprised and shocked. Forbes is very business and tech-focused, so most of the people that get Forbes Under 30 are from that world,” Bosch said. “I’m excited for the conference because there will be a lot of people with backgrounds similar to mine and a lot of people who are nothing like me.” 
Forbes will give the Under 30 Scholars the opportunity to meet with recruiters from American companies. At least three other students from USC, junior business administration major Diego Garza Gonzalez, sophomore business administration major Krish Abrol and junior communication and philosophy, politics and law major Manda Bwerevu, will also attend the summit. 
“I’m just excited to be there and to have the opportunity to be curious and to just talk to people and understand how they got to where they are,” Bosch said. “I’m going, more than anything else, to learn and to be open to other points of view and different  perspectives.”
To pursue her interest in journalism at USC, Bosch also worked as an assistant city editor and writer for the Daily Trojan, an executive television producer for Annenberg Media and an intern at CNBC over the last few years. 
“I think one of the beautiful things about journalism [is that] you really learn how to ask the right questions,” Bosch said. “I think journalism has given me a lot of confidence. Even if I’m not the smartest person in the room, [I] can gauge the situation and be perceptive of how to tell a story about whatever it is or to understand whatever the concept or topic is.” 
Zoe Ginsberg, a junior majoring in political science and journalism, said Bosch’s mentoring helped her grow as a journalist and become executive producer of “See It Live!” a show on Annenberg TV News. 
“I was a really nervous, anxious freshman who didn’t have a voice yet,” Ginsberg said. “But [Bosch] really took me under her wing; I would not be where I am without her. She gave me that stepping stone that I think everyone needs. If anything, she gave me the confidence to put myself out there in a really scary environment.” 
Bosch became interested in international relations, one of her minors because of her frequent moves while growing up. She’s lived in five countries, including the United States, Mexico, Japan, Italy and Spain, thanks to her father’s career in international business. After a Maymester course in which Bosch produced fieldwork in Mexico about finance development, her professor of international relations Pamela Starr suggested that Bosch take on the minor. 
“She’s fascinated by what’s going on in the world, to start with, particularly what’s going on in Latin America,” Starr said. “But she also has a very analytical mind which does lend itself to being a good journalist. It lends itself to somebody who can really understand and analyze international affairs and what’s going on in both international and domestic politics.” 
In addition to her involvement in UPAC, Bosch also volunteers for the Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project and is a mentor for Troy Camp.
“[Troy Camp is] what helped me realize that my interests specifically lie in universal access to education under the umbrella of human rights,” Bosch said. “The girls that I met [as a cabin leader] made Los Angeles feel like home.”
Bosch recently applied to the Fulbright Program in hopes of conducting research after graduation on the aid provided to Venezuelan migrants in Colombia. After graduate school, she hopes to work in international human rights policy and law for the United Nations or the European Union. 
“I hope to walk away [from the summit] with some contacts — a network of people that are big, young industry leaders,” Bosch said. “At the root of anything, whether that be law, policy or business … is people.” 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Under 30 scholars received complimentary lodging. Scholars do not receive free housing. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Nearly 250 students, faculty and staff gathered in Bovard Auditorium for a conversation on foreign policy, human rights and the immigrant experience with former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power Tuesday night. 
The event was co-hosted by 14 organizations, including Undergraduate Student Government and the Center on Public Diplomacy and moderated by CPD director Jay Wang. 
Power is currently a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of International Affairs and previously served in former President Barack Obama’s administration as senior director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights. During the event, she discussed her new book “The Education of an Idealist,” her start as an immigrant from Ireland and her career beginnings as a journalist in the former Yugoslavia. 
Wang began the conversation by asking Power about the title of her book, of which copies were given to every audience member, and about what it means to be an “idealist.”
“My education … was much more about learning how to advance my ideas; how to build coalitions; how to pick myself up off the floor when I have failed in a very public way and often behind the scenes to convince the president of what I thought needed to be done,” Power said. “So to me, idealism is: Are you happy with what you see right now? Do you feel good about what we are doing about climate change? Not so much? Chances are you have a set of ideas you want to work toward.”
Power said her education started when she immigrated to the United States with her family from Ireland. Though she did not experience as dramatic a transition as immigrants facing a language barrier, she said having that background shaped her outlook on the country and her motivation as an ambassador.
“When you’re an immigrant, you do retain the ability to see America through the eyes of an outsider — I threw myself into sports and threw myself into becoming as American as quickly as I could,” Power said. “I represented the United States on a global stage, but it never really goes away and you’re connected to your family.”
Wang said he relates to Power’s story as an immigrant himself and said the stories in her book are deeply personal and universal.
“As immigrants, we are not interested in the impossible, and to me, America is always about becoming — becoming something better and doing things that you otherwise couldn’t in other parts of the world,” Wang said.
Power also discussed her professional path and how she started off wanting to become a sports journalist. In her novel, Power recounts her experience as an intern at CBS in Atlanta. She said there was a moment when she was taking notes on a game displayed on one monitor, while live broadcasts of the crackdown on Tiananmen Square demonstrators in China were displaying on the other. According to Power, it  was at this moment she realized she wanted to learn more about the world.
“All I knew was that I just didn’t feel I knew enough,” Power said. “Here I didn’t know anything about these students, I didn’t know anything much at all about China or Chinese history, so my resolve was very incremental. It wasn’t, ‘I am giving up on wanting to be a sports journalist …,’ it was simply, ‘I am going to go back to college and going to study more and see if I can learn more so that I can put my resolve in some context.’”
At the start of her career, Power went into the Balkans to report on the war and the violent human rights violations in Bosnia. After her time in the Balkans, Wang said Power had many professional paths to pursue, including working for American diplomat Richard Holbrooke. However, Power decided to attend Harvard Law School after deciding to take a step back from reporting.
“I also thought there was something very tangible about the tool of law,” Power said. “I was seeing lawlessness and impunity everywhere. Maybe I would have something more concrete than the power of the pen.”
Power has since devoted her life to studying mass atrocities and working toward ending human rights abuses through her policies of humanitarian intervention. In 2003, she won the Pulitzer Prize for Non-Fiction for her novel “A Problem from Hell,” which follows U.S. action, and inaction, in the face of genocide.  
After the discussion, three students asked questions to the former ambassador on topics ranging from America’s Ebola outbreak response to the most hopeful time during Power’s time as ambassador. 
Lisa De Rafols, a senior majoring in international relations and economics, said Power’s event taught her about the impact one individual can have on foreign policy, decision making and human rights.
“I learned that the path isn’t always very straight for people who want to achieve those things,” De Rafols said. “There are always lots of difficulties and lots of upheavals that can arise and are unpredictable, but if you are staying true to your values and your ideals, you will be able to impact the people and communities that you want to impact.”
Charlie Convery, a junior majoring in international relations, said bringing Power to campus was a great way to help students engage in intellectual dialogue about lessons learned inside the classroom.
“As an IR major, it is important that when USC offers an opportunity to see the person who makes the policies we hear about in class and to actually go and hear them speak firsthand,” Convery said. “I think she’s left a lasting impact on U.S. foreign policy.”
