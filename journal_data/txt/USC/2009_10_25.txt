When Steven Philp ran for president of his fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, some of his fraternity brothers opposed his campaign because of his sexual orientation.
“I know that one of the issues that was brought up was, ‘Do we want a gay president?’” Philp, a senior majoring in creative writing said. “And a lot of members said no.”
Philp said he heard members discussing whether, with a gay president, Beta would be known as “the gay fraternity.” Though he was eventually elected vice president last year, his experiences as a gay member of a fraternity have prompted him to speak out.
“It’s stepping into a really foreign and supposedly hostile world,” Philp said. “Everyone knows the stereotypes.”
To make that world less foreign and hostile, the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Assembly and the LGBT Resource Center have hosted a panel discussion featuring former and current gay fraternity members and social events in the last two weeks to try to start a dialogue about how gay students are treated in the Greek system.
But people involved with the events — both gay and Greek — said some of the very misunderstandings that necessitated the discussions may have hindered their attempts at starting a dialogue.
The GLBTA and the LGBT Resource Center hosted a SpeakOut panel discussion on Oct. 12. The GLBTA had been in contact with the Interfraternity Council via email during the summer, but eventually the groups fell out of contact, according to IFC president Nick Hamada.
IFC later received an email inviting fraternity members to attend the panel and listen to the discussion, but the event was held on a Monday — the same day most fraternities hold formal chapter meetings and sororities host Monday Night Dinner.
“The event itself — great idea. The fact that it happened during chapter was a huge oversight,” said Philp, who served on the panel. “And that’s that lack of communication coming from both sides.”
Hamada attended the panel, but few other fraternity members did — mostly, he said, because of the conflict with their meetings.
“That makes it really hard for people to participate,” Hamada said.
This poor scheduling only further emphasized one of the main problems plaguing discussions between these two communities. That misunderstanding — on both sides of the issue — has been a theme throughout several GLBT events held this month.
“I don’t think each group understands how the other operates,” said Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center.
One sorority is addressing the issue on its own. On Monday, the Delta Delta Delta sorority will host a panel discussion at its house, co-sponsored by the GLBTA and the LGBT Resource Center, about being a lesbian in a sorority. The LGBT Resource Center and GLBTA also plan to hold a SpeakOut panel aimed at sororities in the spring.
“Being a lesbian in a sorority is very different from being a gay man in a fraternity,” GLBTA Director Genevieve Flores said. “People aren’t aware of the difference.”
Blessing Waung, president of the Panhellenic Council, said she does not think sororities experience the same issues as the fraternity system.
“The taboo might be more present in the fraternity community than in the sorority community,” Waung said. “I just don’t feel like there is a blatant discrimination against gay and lesbian people in our community.
“I feel like the Daily Trojan’s trying to make an issue where there isn’t one,” she said.
Still, Tri-Delt member Chelsea Taylor, a freshman majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said she thinks it’s an important issue to discuss.
“It’s really important that we are more accepting of people of different sexualities and sexual orientations,” Taylor said. “If the fraternities and sororities collaborated with the LGBT community I think it would create a greater sense of belonging for everyone and especially the LGBT.”
Waung did say that if members of the Panhellenic community ever approached her and felt the issue needed to be addressed, she would be open to working with the GLBTA.
Laura Redfern, vice president of communications for Panhellenic, said though Panhellenic as a whole has not yet addressed the issue, it is not writing it off completely.
“We’re full-time students as well. We can only have so much on our plate — but it doesn’t mean it’s not important to us,” Redfern said.
Philp thinks the Tri-Delt event is perhaps even a larger step in the right direction than the panel earlier in the month. Though educating the leaders of these councils is great, he said, he believes greater change can be affected by working with specific chapters.
“Change from the top down is not as effective,” Philp said. “You really have to start with chapter opinions … Maybe part of the new member education that happens every semester for frats can include some kind of tolerance, some kind of diversity.”
Still, the GLBTA hoped the panel would be a step, however small, toward understanding.
“We’re interacting and calling awareness to the fact that there are LGBT people within the Greek system and starting up that dialogue between those two communities, making it more of a collaboration,” Flores said.
Isaac Ahn, a senior majoring in creative writing, called attention to the issue last spring when he submitted a letter to the editor in the Daily Trojan about his experiences rushing while openly gay. He wrote that while he was rushing Alpha Gamma Omega fraternity, two brothers approached him to discuss his sexual orientation in such a way that Ahn no longer felt welcome.
“It was really upsetting, almost traumatizing,” Ahn said in an interview.
But what disappointed Ahn more, he said, was that when he approached IFC and the university, he was told nothing could be done.
“AGO was one thing,” Ahn said. “But I received no help from IFC or USC.”
Further emphasizing the divide between the two communities, however, Ray Carlos, assistant director of fraternity and sorority leadership, said the issue had been handled, though he declined to say how.
Ahn’s letter called attention to this issue and helped spark various panels and events this month. Though more gays and allies attended the panel than did Greeks, because of the timing, most everyone involved felt it was a productive discussion. Many insisted it’s just as important for members of the LGBT community to understand the Greek community as for Greeks to understand LGBT.
“During the seminar last week ,a lot of people didn’t even realize how the rush process worked, and that alone was very enlightening,” Carlos said.
Philp said the LGBT community shares the responsibility for making the Greek and gay relationship better.
“There definitely is a tension, and I think that tension is a problem, but I think that tension can be alleviated by communication,” Philp said. “And this is something I place the onus of on the LGBT community. Many members of the LGBT community, once they’re aligned or rejected initially, they kind of turn their backs on it … That’s not healthy.”
Both Philp and Ahn said gay males looking to become involved in Greek life can help themselves by rushing “out” — many rush without disclosing their sexual orientation, and this can cause problems later.
“You want to get into an organization that’s going to be conducive to yourself and who you are as a person,” Philp said.
Philp also encourages other gays to be open about their sexual orientation because he thinks interaction is the way to eliminate misconception between these two groups.
“The most powerful tool I had in a frat was exposing to this group of 80 men someone who’s LGBT and who likes football,” Philp said. “Exposure is the only way to change mindsets.”
Members of both communities said they have been pleased with the discussions so far and hope communication between the two groups will continue.
“Certainly people are scared.  They’re scared of what they don’t know,” Flores said. “We’re just trying to open up conversation so that people do know what an LGBT person looks like.”
Steven Philp:  We are very proud of you and you can be my president anytime.
It’s hard Thite.  Really hard to come out on the Row.  Luckily my fraternity (not going to mention which one) is open and accepting and has quite a few gay and bi guys.  I applaud Phillip for being who he is.
It is time for all the closet gays on the Row to come out!  Be proud boys!
I picked up a copy of the Daily Trojan this morning and read this article before class.  I think it was unprofessional of the author to mention the fraternity AGO without asking for their position on this issue.  I am not a member of AGO (a Christian fraternity), but I have several friends who are.  I would really have liked to see a comment from one of their members in this article or at least a show of effor from the author that she tried to contact AGO for comment.
I really don’t see what the big deal is…if a gay student enters the Greek system that  ALREADY has a well-established foundation of traditional (including heterosexual) values, then the gay students either PUT ASIDE the sexuality issues because they have other, MORE SIGNIFICANT common ground with members of a particular chapter, OR they go into it with the AGENDA of changing that heterosexual institution!!
So why should a PRIVATE organization, with many standards of exclusivity (must be a student, etc) be EXPECTED to lay aside one of those standards, just to accommodate a person who denies the importance of that particular standard?!?
Simply put, why would a Greek organization invite someone to join who enters the group wearing their sexuality “on their shirt-sleeve” and bringing all the ensuing potential for conflict that issue brings?
Conversely, why would a gay student not rather find (or even start) a fraternal (or similar) organization more in keeping with their “pre-existing condition”, instead of trying to be a “trailblazer” or “pioneer” who enters the traditional Greek system with the INTENT of making waves/changing the system?
Maybe the LGBT community needs to learn more about the Greek community, rather than the other way around as presented in this article. It isn’t the job of the Greek leaders to explain themselves to alternative lifestyle groups. What responsibility does the Greek system have to pander to the LGBT community?
Isaac Ahn was looking to receive help from the University and IFC about AGO, but for what? AGO is a private organization whose membership is not determined by University administrators or any other outside group.
There are 21 fraternities and 10 sororities at ‘SC – all you have to do is find a House that shares your particular interests and beliefs. That’s what Steven Philp did: he joined a fraternity that fit what he wanted, and was eventually able to rise to the leadership of his peers.

Though the nationwide financial crisis has had little effect on the university’s operating costs for this year, the $1.2 billion loss endured by USC’s endowment over the last year will likely have an impact on the school’s spending for 2010, administrators say.
Until June 2007, the endowment, which pays for 5 percent of the university’s operations and accumulates interest through various investments, enjoyed steady growth leading to a high of $3.7 billion.
But it began a decline later that year, mirroring the first tremors of the worldwide market crash, falling from $3.6 billion in June 2008 to $2.4 billion by March 2009.
“All markets were down. International stock markets were down, US stock markets were down, so there was no place to hide,” said USC associate senior vice president and treasurer Ruth Wernig.  “Everything pretty much went down. Plus, we’re in the middle of a credit crisis.”
USC aims for low risks and high returns by diversifying its investment portfolio, with substantial investments both in the United States and abroad, Wernig said. Endowment funds are also invested in real estate, energy investments, bonds, venture capital and hedge funds.
Though the information for the most recent financial quarter is still being compiled, Wernig said the endowment rose slightly to $2.5 billion in June, and showed improvement in July, August and September as well.
Despite a $1.2 billion loss over the course of a year, the administration minimized the importance of the endowment for the university.
“It’s a significant loss for the endowment, but a drop in the endowment does not have a big effect on the university like it does at other schools, so that’s a good thing,” Wernig said.
USC’s interim senior vice president and chief financial officer Robert Abeles said the loss over the past few months did not affect spending for this fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2010.
As with last year, $140 million, or 5 percent of the endowment, will be spent.
The reason the endowment payout — the amount the university uses on an annual basis — hasn’t decreased, Abeles said, is because USC calculates the payout based on an average of the endowment value over the past three years, rather than just the previous quarter.
This calculation, known as a rolling average, shields the university payout from year-to-year fluctuations of the market.
Lawrence Picus, a professor of education policy and finance at the Rossier School of Education, said he would be surprised if some schools don’t use a rolling average to help smooth out fluctuations.
“By having a rolling average, it gives us a soft landing when the value of the endowment goes down,” Picus said. “It’s a strategy to make sure that no one is badly hurt in bad times and that we wisely think about how to use the money in good [times].”
As a result, the endowment payout this year still factored in gains made in the stock market three years ago, nullifying some of the losses from over the last year, Abeles said.
“The endowment went down a billion, [but] no one has felt that effect yet because we’ve kept the payout constant,” Wernig said.
Next year, Abeles said, the endowment’s decrease will have more of an impact on spending because the worst months of the economic crisis will be calculated into the rolling average.
“The bottom line is [there will be] no effect on the university’s operations this year, but there’s a potential effect for fiscal year 2011. We’re getting into years now that weren’t so good for the endowment,” he said.
The Board of Trustees, which approves the payout percentage in the spring, will vote whether to increase it to match this year’s $140 million, or keep it consistent and less money.
Abeles said it would be difficult to project how much the payout might be cut next year, but said he expects it to be cut by less than 10 percent — meaning the overall operating budget would lose no more than half a percent of its funds from the payout.
At the same time, Abeles said, he has warned the administration to be cautious about its spending and hiring. It is also not committing to beginning construction on new buildings, he said.
Abeles said the university’s endowment losses over the last year are relatively small compared to other private universities, but affects the school less, because of its lack of dependence on the endowment for operating costs. He said the biggest problem USC would face financially is if people couldn’t afford to attend or if enrollment was dropping.
“We haven’t had that problem. We’ve probably been the least affected of the major universities by this decline, and we don’t expect it to be a major factor in the years ahead,” Abeles said.
Are you sure the title reads right? The whole texts seem to suggest that the endowment loss will/does NOT affect 2010, instead, it might affect the years to come. Is my reading just wrong, or am I missing something crucial for understanding?
I’m glad USC is less dependent on its endowment and not hurting as bad other universities. However, I was wondering what will the university do to replenish and enhance its endowment? What happened to the 5 billion endowment campaign?

USC is ranked No. 5 in the BCS standings, two positions higher than a week ago.
After the Trojans 42-36 win over Oregon State on Saturday,  they moved past Cincinnati and Boise State in the standings, although neither team lost. Cincinnati defeated Louisville 41-10 and Boise State dismantled Hawaii 54-9.
USC (6-1) is the highest ranked one-loss team, ahead of undefeated TCU, Boise State and Cincinnati.
Florida and Alabama remain atop the standings despite less-than-impressive victories this weekend.  Texas is No. 3, followed by No. 4 Iowa, who narrowly escaped an upset by Michigan State, 13-9.
Five teams on USC’s schedule are ranked in this week’s BCS top 25. Oregon, who the Trojans face next, moved up to No. 10, while Arizona, who USC plays on Dec. 5, jumped to No. 20.
Notre Dame and Cal, previously unranked, worked their way into the rankings at No. 23 and No. 24, respectively. Ohio State also moved up two spots to No. 17.

He may have stolen your heart, but Ben & Jerry’s stole your waistline. When the games of love turn rough, who isn’t guilty of cold comfort and shamelessly indulging while watching Sex and the City?
With Arctic Zero, those late night romps may result in fewer belly bumps.
Frozen yogurt has given many people a way to indulge a sweet tooth with far less guilt. Slow-churned ice creams make midnight munchies a little safer, but trips to Yogurtland gradually add up, and slow-churned ice creams are loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients.
Arctic Zero is something different. It’s made for the home freezer. It’s all-natural. And a full pint has about 130 calories.
“We see it more as a healthy alternative,” said Arctic Zero vice president Garrett Blood. “We tell people it’s the 10 o’clock answer to their sweet tooth, like when they want to eat and watch a movie. Because ultimately, you wear what you eat.”
Unlike Dreyer’s Slow Churned, which relies on emulsifiers, sugar and unpronounceable chemicals, Arctic Zero has no artificial sweeteners or preservatives. It is made from whey protein instead of milk or cream and uses plant fibers such as xanthan gum to mimic fat. For sugar, Arctic Zero uses Whey Low, a natural sweetener rarely used because of its high price.
The resulting product is fat free, high in protein and low in sugar. In addition, people who are lactose intolerant, or those with celiac disease, type II diabetes and soy allergies can enjoy it without fearing the consequences. Those tired of junky Weight Watchers products, take note.
This innovative product comes in a variety of flavors: vanilla maple, strawberry banana, chocolate and chocolate peanut butter. The tastiest comes down to personal preference.
The chocolate peanut butter sang the sweetest. While stronger on the chocolate front than the peanut butter, it nevertheless nipped a Reese’s craving, and made her late night studying a little less stressful.
Coming in second, the chocolate is as strong as standard milk chocolate and carries none of that maltitol-derived saccharine taste found in sugar-free chocolates.
For the vanilla maple, imagine milk with a chunk of French toast.
While Blood said strawberry banana is the least popular flavor, tasters disagree.
“It tastes like a really cold Jamba Juice,” said Cara Bickers, a junior majoring in biology.
According to Blood, these flavors will soon be joined by cookies and cream, coffee, pumpkin pie and chocolate mint.
But taste is only part of the frozen dessert experience. There is also the creamy-rich silk of real ice cream as it slides down your throat. Arctic Zero makes a respectable effort. It is surprisingly creamy, and goes down incredibly smooth. Think of a harder version of soft-serve.
Where the mask comes off, however, is when you leave it on the counter too long. In a half-melted state, the silk takes on a slimy quality, most likely from the plant fiber. And if it’s gone, it’s gone — like most ice creams, Arctic Zero cannot recover texturally from a total meltdown.
At the same time, Arctic Zero is an ice cream alternative, not ice cream. Tasters agreed they would not mistake it for the real thing.
“It’s a good alternative, but it’s nothing I would crave,” said Jessica Choi, a junior majoring in business administration. “I’d be down to eat it before rugby practice.”
But Arctic Zero is a good way to satisfy a craving for something cold and creamy and makes a fitting accompaniment for prime-time television.
It won’t break the bank, either. Most stores carrying Arctic Zero charge between $3.50 and $3.89 per pint, while Ben & Jerry typically charges $3.79 per pint.
Though people now rely on Amazon and select natural stores for their Arctic Zero fix, the creators are rapidly expanding. It just debuted in Whole Foods and has entered the testing phase in Vons and Safeway. It won’t be long before Arctic Zero is as accessible as Skinny Cow.
“Fifteen percent [of the market] is healthy, alternative-type ice cream,” Blood said. “We’re in that 15 percent niche. That’s all we’re interested in being, but we figure we are a superior alternative to all those sugar alcohols and chemical-laden ice cream products that are out there.”
Even with limited distribution, Arctic Zero has its followers, from professional bodybuilders to the Olympic beach volleyball team.
Arctic Zero has many interesting possibilities — one can mix it into regular ice cream to increase volume or even use it for milkshakes. Since no one has yet to test Arctic Zero’s culinary versatility, an enchanting window of possibility remains.
Even though Arctic Zero’s future is wide open, some just care for the present.
“It’s good for a sleepover,” Gish said. “You can eat the whole thing and not feel fat in the morning.”
Bought some of this yummy goodness; I’m addicted.

Behind the strong play of sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter, the struggling No. 18 USC women’s volleyball team gained some confidence back this weekend as it swept No. 12 Oregon and unranked Oregon State at the Galen Center to end a four-match losing streak.
It was the kind of successful weekend USC needed to bounce back from a four-match skid that was starting to weigh the team down.
Crisis control · Alex Jupiter helped USC get back on track. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
“[The losing streak] shook everybody’s confidence,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We really had to work hard to get back everyone’s confidence.”
Jupiter led the way with 19 kills and 24.5 points Saturday against the Ducks, adding three service aces, seven digs and three blocks in the victory (26-24, 25-23, 30-28). She has been the Women of Troy’s most consistent player throughout the first half of the Pac-10 season, compiling a 5.27 kills per set average with 198.6 points for a 6.02 points per clip set.
But Jupiter wasn’t alone in leading USC (15-6, 4-5) to victory. Sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams posted a season-high 12 kills and hit .500 for USC, while sophomore setter Kendall Bateman recorded 49 assists and nine digs with three block assists.
“I have to really compliment our setter Kendall Bateman,” Haley said. “Her play has been just stellar … and Jupiter continues to be a person we can count on. She was over 19 [kills] in each of the games this weekend, so our sophomores are really producing.”
Sonja Newcombe led Oregon (14-5, 4-5) with 21 kills and 10 digs while hitting .442. Heather Meyers added 13 kills and 13 digs. Nevena Djordjevic recorded 44 assists with six digs for the Ducks, while Neticia Enesi had nine kills in a .467 day.
Oregon built a 16-9 lead in the first set before USC rallied to win. Audrey Eichler, who had eight kills for the Women of Troy, started a 7-2 run and cut the deficit to 18-16. Meyers kept the Ducks ahead by three, but the Trojans continued to chip away, until senior Jessica Gysin’s kill evened the score at 22.
USC took set point at 24-23, but Oregon’s Katherine Fischer tied it with a kill. Jupiter hit the sideout kill, and Gysin capped the rally for the 1-0 lead.
The Women of Troy built a 17-11 lead in the second set, but the Ducks wouldn’t go down easy. Oregon took advantage of late errors by USC to get within two at 22-20. Jupiter was stuffed on a block by Enesi and Meyers, but junior middle blocker Eichler and Bateman returned the favor on Fischer for set point. Jupiter recorded a hitting error, but USC went back to Eichler for the set-winner.
In the final set, Oregon again used a late rush to tie it at 24-24 on Haley Jacob’s service ace. USC held the advantage with constant sideouts. After Gysin made it 29-28, Meyers’ attempt sailed wide on the right side, wrapping up the match for USC.
USC notched its first sweep earlier in the weekend against the Beavers (25-17, 25-15, 25-22) Friday night to give the team some momentum heading into Saturday’s showdown with Oregon.
Jupiter posted a team-high 19 kills and 24.0 points in the match. Eichler registered a season-high 10 kills for USC, while hitting .471. Williams chipped in eight kills for a .429 match with four blocks. Bateman, who entered the match ranked fifth in the nation for assists, had 39 assists as the Trojans hit .337 for the match.
“Most teams are winning at home and struggling on the road,” Haley said. “We had to create a situation of stability and let our players know they can recover from the losses … We got two important wins this weekend.”

All things considered, Pete Carroll had no reason to complain with the end result.
But the defense-minded coach sighed slightly when discussing his team giving up season-highs Saturday in points and yards allowed.
Welcome home · USC junior receiver Ronald Johnson stiff arms Oregon State cornerback Tim Clark after one of his nine catches Saturday. In just his second game of the season since coming back from injury, Johnson led USC with 99 yards receiving. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
After the Trojans surged out to an early lead, USC and Oregon State swapped scores down the stretch in a shootout that left both defenses exhausted. A high-powered attack centered on a strong ground game pushed USC toward a 42-36 win against Oregon State on Saturday at the Coliseum.
The Beavers were within striking range of the Trojans in the fourth quarter, but the USC offense converted two third downs and bled the final five minutes off the clock to secure the win.
“This is a different game than we hoped to have,” Carroll said. “The offense carried us because we challenged them to win this game for us.”
Redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford anchored the USC running game with a career-high 147 yards on 15 carries. With starter Joe McKnight sidelined by a hand injury, Bradford became the offense’s centerpiece. He plunged into the end zone from the 2-yard line and ripped off a 43-yard run in the third quarter for his second touchdown of the day.
But even after redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown, the Beavers did not relent.
A 1-yard touchdown run by Oregon State running back Jacquizz Rodgers drew the Beavers within six, but Oregon State couldn’t cut any deeper into the Trojans’ lead.
“We really just ran out of time,” Oregon State quarterback Sean Canfield said. “At the end of the day, we just didn’t get enough big plays.”
Canfield shredded the Trojans secondary for 329 yards and three touchdowns on 30-of-43 passing. After Rodgers was temporarily sidelined by an ankle injury in the second quarter, Canfield kept the Beavers offense alive by repeatedly finding his safety valves. His favorite target, tight end Joe Halahuni, reeled in nine catches for 127 yards.
The diminutive Rodgers returned in the second half to give the Beavers balance by rushing for 113 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries.
“We schemed the run up really well and thought that was what they were going to come out and do, especially after last year,” said redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo. “They came out early and we shut the running game down, but then they got out on us in the passing game and the perimeter game.”
The Beavers’ 36 points was the most allowed by a USC team in the Coliseum since 2005. For a USC defense that has frequently lifted a sluggish offense through the first half of the season, the role reversal came as somewhat of a surprise.
“Letting up 36 points, you can lose a lot of games that way,” said senior safety Taylor Mays. “It’s disappointing, but we have confidence in what we can do.”
Coming off a career game at Notre Dame, true freshman quarterback Matt Barkley had two touchdowns passing and ran the ball in for a score from the 1-yard line. The signal-caller’s second touchdown throw came in the second quarter when wide receiver Ronald Johnson made a diving catch in the end zone for his first score of the year.
After missing the first five games of the season with a broken collarbone and contributing sparingly against Notre Dame, the junior said the highlight reel catch provided him with relief.
“It felt like all the pressure was off me,” Johnson said. “It had been so long since I had gotten one, so it felt really good.”
Barkley also threw two interceptions, including a fourth-quarter pick that set up the Beavers’ final scoring drive.
Still in the thick of a Pac-10 title race with next week’s game against conference leader Oregon looming, the Trojans took solace in coming out of the night still poised to make a run for the league championship.
“Every week in the Pac-10 is a dogfight,” Galippo said. “You have to be ready for teams that are trying to make their season by beating you.”

Allen Bradford was ready to quit.
The bruising redshirt junior USC running back admits he considered transferring multiple times when it seemed he wasn’t working his way into the rotation.
Long time coming · Allen Bradford, who has waited his turn for four years, said his father’s words kept him going through the hard times. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But the words of his father, Keith, always stayed with him.
“My dad told me, ‘Life’s gonna get hard — you can’t run from it,’” Bradford said.
Instead, Bradford played true to his father’s words and ran through it, showcasing his power and his speed as he pounded Oregon State defenders in USC’s 42-36 win Saturday against the Beavers at the Coliseum.
In his long-awaited breakout game as a Trojan, Bradford rushed for 147 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries, his first 100-yard performance. The 5-foot-11, 235-pound running back is known for his power, but he demonstrated his speed as well on a 43-yard scoring burst in the third quarter.
Bradford entered the game in the second quarter and dominated from there on. Joe McKnight, the starter, got only three carries after Bradford went in, partly because of a hand injury, but mostly because Bradford was hot.
In his first chance to be “the man,” Bradford demonstrated what Trojan fans had been missing out on all these years.
Coming out of Colton High in San Bernardino, Bradford was supposed to be the next powerful back to play at USC. But a crowded backfield that included a handful of other blue chip running backs limited his chances.
He was then slowed by injuries, particularly a hip flexor that required surgery last season and forced him to redshirt.
Multiple times he felt like transferring, and he wondered if he had made the wrong choice in coming to USC. But encouragement from his dad and his teammates picked him up in the same way he carried the USC offense Saturday night.
“Players like Taylor Mays, Thomas Williams — a lot of players — told me, ‘Just stick it out, your time will come,’” Bradford said.
Bradford recalls the early season game against Idaho his sophomore year as being one of his most trying moments. Starting running back Chauncey Washington went down with an injury, and Bradford expected to be the guy called upon to rise to the occasion and fill in.
But when coaches chose to give other running backs a chance instead, Bradford was dejected.
“Chauncey was hurt and I still didn’t get in,” he said. “I think that was the lowest point for me on the field. That’s when I really just thought about leaving.”
Coach Pete Carroll wasn’t quite sure what to do with Bradford when he joined the Trojans in 2006. Originally recruited as a safety, Bradford moved back to running back and also bounced around to full back during his freshman year.
He carried the ball just 13 times as a freshman and 15 times as a sophomore. He found the end zone five times, but it wasn’t enough to keep the former prep star satisfied.
That’s why this season has been so fulfilling for Bradford. His role in the offense has been building from the opening game, and in light of the injury to Stafon Johnson, he’s getting more and more touches each game.
“It’s sad how it had to come,” Bradford said of his increased role. “I would rather have Stafon back and him not going through that than me playing more, but I just had to open the door when opportunity knocked.”
He didn’t open the door so much as run through it, establishing himself as the go-to power back that coaches can use to counter the speed of Joe McKnight.
If that sounds familiar to the “Thunder and Lightning” days of the Reggie Bush-Lendale White era, that’s no accident. In fact, it’s what Carroll has been waiting for.
“I love having the tough, physical, hard-nosed guy,” Carroll said. “I’ve always felt like we’ve had our best offenses when we have that guy.”
Bradford wants to be that guy and fill the role that White played to such perfection.
“I just want to be the thunder and have Joe be the lightning,” Bradford said.
It has been a long journey to this point for Bradford, but it finally seems as if the wait has paid off. Since the words of his father helped to lift him through the low moments of his USC career, Bradford honored him by writing “I promise” on his eye black.
It is a promise to his father that Bradford will make it to the NFL one day, and provide for his father so he can stop working six days a week as a janitor in San Bernardino.
It is a promise that Bradford will never quit.
It is perhaps also a promise Bradford is making to himself, a reminder that if football gets hard again, the only place he’ll be running is into the end zone.

The story: No. 4 USC avenged an early-season defeat from a year ago, beating Oregon State — just barely — in a closer-than-expected shootout, 42-36.
The Beavers had two chances to get the ball back late in the fourth quarter but failed to stop the USC offense on two third-down plays.
Return specialist · Damian Williams’ punt return for a touchdown proved to be the decisive score that lifted the Trojans over the Beavers. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“It sucks,” said Oregon State quarterback Sean Canfield, who completed 30-of-43 passes for 329 yards and three touchdowns. “We just ran out of time. We didn’t make enough plays, and they made more.”
USC (6-1) led 21-6 at one point and 42-23 at another, but Oregon State (4-3) didn’t let up and pushed its way back into the game on both occasions.
“It’s a lesson learned,” said redshirt junior linebacker Michael Morgan said. “We shut them down for the most part in the first half, but they came out as a different team in the second half.”
Key play: Shortly after the start of the fourth quarter, USC junior receiver Damian Williams took a punt back 63 yards for the touchdown, opening the Trojans’ lead up to 42-23.
At the time it looked like it would be the dagger in the Beavers’ collective heart.
Oregon State did manage to put together two consecutive touchdown drives to narrow the score, but Williams’ touchdown proved to be the difference.
“We needed a big play, and we were real fortunate to make that play,” Williams said. “The biggest thing was the blocking. I told the guys that all they had to do was give 100 percent on that play, and I’d do the rest.”
USC coach Pete Carroll mentioned after the game that special teams coordinator Brian Schneider had switched up the blocking schemes just before the return occurred.
“Damian’s punt return was exhilarating — the play of the year,” Carroll said. “We were anticipating that this might be the one, and it was.”
Most valuable player: Redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford. Bradford set career highs with 15 carries and 147 yards, including two touchdowns and six first downs.
He didn’t replace starter Joe McKnight until midway through the second quarter.  From that point on, McKnight rushed the ball only three times, while Bradford ran all over the Oregon State defense.
Surprise performance: After a forgettable one-catch performance at Notre Dame a week prior, junior receiver Ronald Johnson led the Trojans in receiving with six catches for 99 yards and a touchdown against the Beavers.
Johnson also made an impressive diving catch on a corner route that got the Coliseum crowd roaring early in the second quarter.
“It doesn’t get any better than that,” Johnson said. “Making a comeback like that, it just feels perfect.”
Johnson missed the first five games of the season with a broken collarbone before making a largely uneventful return against Notre Dame last week.
The Rodgers brothers: Jacquizz and James Rodgers continued to terrorize the Trojans, producing a combined 317 all-purpose yards Saturday. Neither brother weighs more than 200 pounds nor stands taller than 5-foot-7, but that didn’t stop them from torching USC’s defense.
James, the elder brother and a receiver, caught seven passes for 56 yards, ran six times for 46 yards and racked up 96 kick return yards.
Jacquizz, a running back, rushed for 115 yards on 20 carries despite missing the entire second quarter.
“He’s intense,” middle linebacker Chris Galippo said of the sophomore, who ran for 194 yards against the Trojans in 2008. “He’s super explosive, he’s really shifty, he’s got tremendous balance.”
Stat of the game: 482 total offense for Oregon State to 429. The Beaver offense outgained the Trojans for the second consecutive year.
“They are probably the most explosive offense we have played,” USC safety Taylor Mays said. “With Jacquizz and James [Rodgers], it has to be the best offense we have played.”
Do not go to the PREVENT defense in the 4th quarter!!!   The first three quarter we play the receivers tight and occassionally blitz.  But in the 4th quarter the last two weeks we play soft, allow too much space and never blitz.  The difference is obvious,  USC loses the 4th quarter even if they win the game it leaves a bad impression of just hanging on.  If USC can average over 4 yards per carry -why not run the ball in the 4th quarter when we are ahead and keep the ball away from the opponent?
EVERYONE ON THE THE DEFENSE SEEMS TO WANT TO MAKE THE HILITE PLAY RATHER THAN PLAYING THEIR ASSIGNMENT, SO THEY ARE CONTINUALLY OUT OF POSITION, THAT’S HOW BACKS ARE BREAKING OFF LONG RUNS ON CUT BACKS, GUYS ARE OVER PURSUING AND LEAVING OPEN LANES. GRIFFIN DOESN’T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS PLAYING FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BEING UNDISCIPLINED WILL REALLY HURT HIM IN THE DRAFT.  TAYLOR MAYS IS NOT COVERING LIKE HE IS SUPPOSE TO, HE IS LATE ON COVERAGE AND NOT WHERE HE SHOULD BE ON PASS PLAYS. HIS TOP PRIORITY SEEMS TO BE KNOCKING SOMEONE OUT RATHER THAN PLAYING THE BALL. HE WAS LATE TO THE BALL ALL DAY AGAINST OSU AND ND, HE HAS NO BALL SKILLS AND ONLY  WANTS TO HIT SOMEONE RATHER THAN GO FOR THE BALL. IF HE DOESN’T DEVELOP SOME BALL SKILLS HE WILL BE A LINEBACKER IN THE PRO.

Part of working in an office is respecting, or at the very least recognizing, the hierarchy of the workplace. Especially as a young person trying to climb the corporate ladder, you must check your ego at the door and accept your role and your responsibilities, no matter how ignoble they may be.
In some professions, these entry-level positions are temporary — means to a (fingers crossed) lucrative end. In the law world, however, these class differences between the educated and the help  are more defined and tend to stay that way.
Chances are the secretary making an hourly wage will never become the managing partner with a six-figure salary. And Human Resources tries its darndest to make sure you don’t forget that.
But even after you’ve come to terms with your less-than-desirable standing, it still stings to be left out of things just because you don’t have a Yale Law School Juris Doctor certificate hanging in your office.
It’s easy to see why the secretaries and paralegals wouldn’t be invited to lunch with a client or a hiring committee meeting. But it’s exclusion from the off-the-clock get-togethers that creates an obvious and sometimes offensive divide between attorneys and the administrative staff and assistants.
For instance, the opportunity to participate in my law firm’s book club was contingent on an employee’s rank. Human Resources would distribute that month’s reading material to any and all attorneys, even those quite undeserving of their “esquire” title. Apparently, not attending law school is the leading indicator of illiteracy. Who knew skimming a book and then talking about it for 15 minutes over a super-sized carafe of wine was a skill exclusive to those who can define “ignorantia juris non excusat?”
Other office get-togethers such as lunchtime baby showers served as added reminders of the firm’s rigid pecking order. When a pregnant attorney approached her due date, the whole office was expected to attend the shower and “ooh” and “ahh” as she opened one onesie after another.
But when a member of the support staff had a baby on the way, only fellow members of the firm’s proletariat were on the guest list. With no attorneys in attendance, an odd double standard emerged, begging the question: are babies with Ivy League legacy inherently more deserving of celebration than offspring with cubicle-dwelling ancestry?
But the worst of these hierarchy-related offenses took place last summer in regard to an attorney-client softball game in which the attorneys engaged in some friendly, debatably athletic, competition with the employees of a local insurance company.
From the get go, the support staff  members felt slighted when they were invited to attend the ball game provided that they stayed in the bleachers like dutiful spectators, cheering on the very men and women that pile paperwork on their desks and reprimand their every oversight.
Nevertheless, many of these secretaries were good sports about it and had no problem doing what the support staff does best: supporting co-workers.
Turns out, the game was rained out and postponed, though no one bothered to mention this to the secretaries who were still planning on attending.
When the game was finally rescheduled, Human Resources failed to notify the secretaries with so much as a brief email.
But even without a formal invitation, the secretaries knew the game was on when attorneys decked out in Mets and Yankees baseball caps headed out of the office early in awkward leisure attire carrying coolers of beer.
The divide between the high- and low-ranking employees in any office can cause feelings of deflated self-worth in even the most confident of people. Although these distinctions can spark inferiority complexes, sometimes maintaining this line between the “help” and the management is crucial to maintaining order.
When you’re working in a professional environment, you are expected to have a good rapport with your superiors, but it should never be so close that co-workers start referring to you as the next Paris and Nicole (circa 2003, of course). It is Human Resources’ duty to distinguish between the secretaries and the attorneys, the assistants and the agents, and the nurses and the doctors, in order to build an office hierarchy that breeds respect.
In the case of separate vs. equal, it is the judgment of this columnist that you should be sentenced to a lifetime of spotty employment should you expect equal opportunity rather than accept your underappreciated position.

To a commuter, Los Angeles may be a huge city with clogged freeways and constant bumper-to-bumper traffic. But to a cyclist, it’s a city of endless opportunity.
The Los Angeles Department of Transportation is attempting to take advantage of the city’s flat surfaces and static climate to make it a bike-friendly city with its 2009 bicycle plan. The plan, which LADOT is publicizing through a number of workshops offering members of the public a chance to comment and make suggestions, could alter roads across the city, including a number of those around USC.
Right lane · Jared Shier (right) and Eric Bruins, members of the USC Cycling Club,  discuss LADOT’s proposed bicycle plan at an interactive public workshop Saturday. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The plan concentrates on making a citywide bicycle transportation system by building 696 miles of new bike lanes — the 5-foot line on the side of a regular street — and separate bike paths. It also plans to install and improve bike signage and parking, emphasize bike safety through education and regulation and increase efforts to fund the plan.
“[The 2009 bicycle plan] is a complete revision of the 1996 and 2002 plans which were essentially the same plan,” said Michelle Mowery, senior project coordinator of bicycle planning and outreach of LADOT. “We took information [from previous plans] and figured out what was still feasible and merged it into the new plan … it’s a huge rebuild.”
Although the plan is a long-term proposition, with LADOT expecting the process to take more than a decade, they are hoping to use the workshops to give the community a chance to add their input.
Around USC, the plan proposes a bicycle lane on Adams Boulevard, a bicycle lane that goes along Exposition Boulevard until Vermont Avenue and encourages bikers to use more “bike-friendly” streets like 29th Street.
Jefferson Boulevard, according to Mowery, is cited in the plan as a “potential” bicycle lane because LADOT would have to compromise by stripping the street of its side-street parking to gain the five feet needed for a bicycle lane.
Some students might enjoy more bike lanes and routes around the campus, but several who attended one of LADOT’s interactive workshops at the Bethune Regional Library in Exposition Park on Saturday, were skeptical.
Eric Bruins, a senior majoring in public policy, planning and development, and a member of the USC Cycling Club, said the plan is a good step for the community, but will need work for it to become a reality. Bruins said he was especially concerned about work along the proposed “Expo Line” route, which is frequently used by USC staff.
“There was an engineering decision somewhere along the line that [a] bike path doesn’t fit, so they moved it to bike lanes, which is fine for [the cycling club] because we’re used to riding on the roads, but it’s going to be hard to convince [students],” Bruins said. “They lost a huge potential biking constituency when they made that decision, and I don’t think they realized that.”
But potential changes would require official analysis into their environmental and traffic impact.
According to Brett Hondorp, principal of Alta Planning and Design, the engineering company that works with LADOT to design the lanes, the city is very careful when making those decisions about possible bike lanes.
For the plan to become a reality, it must go through several transportation, planning and subcommittees before reaching the City Council for approval.
“The timeline is vague at this point,” Mowery said, “because the bike community is asking that the time is extended.”
Some community members, such as former USC photography professor Lisa Auerbach, who attended the workshop, were skeptical that the plan will ever become a reality.
“Words like ‘encourage,’ words like ‘should:’ They’re pretty hedging terms … It sounds good on paper, but when you actually get to the meat about what they are going to do, it’s not there,” Auerbach said.
Bruins added that many of these obstacles are a result of bureaucracy.
“It’s not a planning problem, it’s a political problem,” Bruins said. “There are so many steps along the way that are really [just] political opposition.”
LADOT believes the plan is necessary to get people to think about bikes as a form of transportation rather than recreation, Mowery said. The city hopes to see 5 percent of Los Angeles commuters regularly use their bicycles by 2020, but achieving that will require work from all sides.
“If we continue at the level of interest we have had for the last ten years, in twenty years this could happen,” said Mowery. “But we need to get everyone excited.”
Kind of a non-sequitur, but I just want to point out that Trojan Cycling boys are HAWTT!
In regard to Shannon’s comment:
I understand the frustration you’re exhibiting from the way many people ride on and around campus but I would like to point out that it is completely legal to ride on the sidewalks and even in crosswalks in Los Angeles (see LAMC 56.15). Pedestrians do have the right of way and cyclists are expected to exhibit a certain standard of care (which many don’t around campus), but bikes are still allowed to use the sidewalks.
For whatever reason, bicycles are a hot topic for debate between pedestrians and cars. I think the best way to alleviate much of the hostility between these groups is though education. Cyclists need to be informed of their rights and the laws they’re required to obey but likewise, pedestrians and cars need to understand these laws as well. Most of the arguments stem from a complete lack of understanding or confusion regarding these codes
As a Bruin alumnus, I love the irony of Mr. Bruins name. I can speak from personal experience about the hazards that cyclists face on LA streets. While on my triathlon bike, I was on the receiving end of a hit-n-run accident on Sepulveda Blvd., near LAX. I  was in a coma for three days, and suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury. Fortunately, I have recovered rather well, as I have begun doing triathlons again (my primary forte being the bike). I have MUCH experience in the “urban jungle”, and would be quite willing to give any input regarding traffic trends, hazards, and motorist psychology, as this is an issue that I’m quite adamant about.
Ok.  That’s nice, but how will they convince the student bicyclists to actually use the bike lane rather than running over pedestrians?  Issuing tickets seemed to work for a while but it’s amazing how quickly so many of the reverted back to their illegal ways.

One of the most sensitive — and most important — issues facing our university community is how gay and lesbian individuals are treated in the Greek system. Over the last five years, a trickle of complaints regarding this matter has become a steady flow. The issue was highlighted in a letter sent to the Daily Trojan last spring, when the writer, who had been rejected from a house during the rush process, lamented the “palpable” anti-gay sentiment in fraternities.
Last week, the gay and Greek communities had a great opportunity to begin an honest dialogue about how gays are treated in fraternities and sororities, and what the GLBT community can do to better voice its own concerns. The campus GLBT association hosted a panel so students could speak openly about their experiences. For both sides, it seemed the perfect chance.
But they missed it.
The panel’s organizers made, at best, a half-hearted effort to include the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic in their discussion. No one from those councils was asked to sit on the panel, and it was held on a Monday night, the same night fraternities and sororities schedule much of their mandatory house events; predictably, Greek turnout at the discussion was low.
It’s easy to talk about this problem. What’s tough is coming together to generate real solutions for the people this issue affects most.
It’s time for both the Greek and gay communities to get serious about how gays are treated in the Greek system — they can no longer pretend that there is no issue. Bureaucracies like IFC or Panhellenic often delegate, or wait for the next person to take a stand. But we hope the presidents of both those organizations will recognize their obligation to act. They shouldn’t be in it alone: We hope fraternity and sorority houses will follow the lead of Delta Delta Delta, which tonight is hosting a panel of its own on the issue.
Most of all, it’s time for GLBT students to make a more serious effort to reach out to the Greek community.
Because if they don’t, who will?
What has the Greek system done that is so bad to the gay community, and why is it “one of the most important” issues. That sounds over the top a bit.
The GLBT Student Assembly and the LGBT Resource Center are also sending a student panel to the Diversity Encouragement Council meeting this Wednesday @ 8PM.
Delta Delta Delta reached out to the GLBT Student Assembly and the LGBT Resource Center to speak at their Open Chapter Meeting. The event is for Delta Delta Delta members only.
Anyone have the details on delta delta delta’s panel? This is the first I’m hearing of it, and I might like to attend.

The Thornton School of Music continued its 125th anniversary celebration on Friday, offering students a taste of classic rock history with the Steve Miller Band at Bovard Auditorium.
The Steve Miller Band, which is greatly admired by multiple generations of rock fans, was an appropriate selection for Thornton’s concert presentation.  Although the audience was mostly of families — the concert was part of USC’s Parents Weekend — as well as older rock fans from the general public, the balconies were filled with students who were able to secure tickets.
The joker · Steve Miller performs for classic rock fans at Bovard Friday with his band in celebration of the Thornton School of Music’s 125th anniversary. The concert also featured acts from Thornton students. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
Before Steve Miller appeared on stage, Robert Cutietta, dean of  the Thornton School of Music, addressed the audience, noting that music is a language everyone is able to understand “but only a few can speak eloquently.” It was an appropriate introduction for a night of impressive musical performances.
After a pair of acts from Thornton students — one including an enchanting electric violin — Steve Miller and his band took the stage. It’s tough to expect a riveting show from a group of older musicians, and the band failed to deliver the energy the audience seemed to be craving. The songs were all technically spot-on, but Miller did not bring much passion or emotion to his performance.
In fact, Miller’s personal performance was unexpectedly subdued. He was very focused on his music and hardly acknowledged the audience.
The rest of his band was even more disengaged. The bassist wore all black with a black cowboy hat and the drummer donned sunglasses, both of which seemed to indicate their desire to simply fade into the background.
Indeed, the greatest enthusiasm came from backup singer Sonny Charles.  Charles’ blues vocals were a solid accompaniment to Miller’s crisp lead, but his theatrics on stage were incredibly distracting.
Throughout the entire performance, Charles danced around awkwardly on stage, pandering to audience and practically begging for attention. There were some moments when it was difficult to concentrate on Miller or the music because Charles’ eagerness was so comedic.
The set list consisted primarily of the group’s greatest hits. The band began with “Swingtown,” then followed with the catchy “Abracadabra,” during which the members invited Johnson to help them play.  Next came slower songs, including “Serenade” and “The Stake.”
When Miller finally addressed the audience, he made a dedication to his old friend and mentor, the legendary performer and inventor, Les Paul. Paul died in August and had previously asked Miller to perform “Nature Boy” at his funeral — Miller then sang the song alone with his guitar in the night’s most touching moment.
Finally came the audience favorite: “The Joker.”
The band ended the night with “Take the Money and Run” and “Rock’n Me,” featuring backup vocals from four female Thornton singers. For the encore, Associate Dean for External Relations Christopher Sampson joined the band for crowd favorites “Threshold” and “Jet Airliner,” which brought the audience to its feet.
The concert may not have been particularly exceptional, but Miller did well in acknowledging the importance of the next generation of student musicians. One of his more endearing moments came when he gave a little lecture from “Uncle Steve” about the importance of holding on to publishing rights for any songs they write, concluding with “that’s your tip of the day, kids.”
Thanks for stopping by, Uncle Steve — we enjoyed having you.
I’m not sure what you look for in bands, Amy.  But perhaps you want hotter, younger acts.  Well, Steve Miller may not be for you.  However, you cannot discount the enthusiasm of Sonny Charles.  Even decades into his career, Steve Miller still sounds like he did on the recordings.  His voice and guitar playing are spot on.  That alone should garner a solid review.  The stage show was excellent considering the tiny stage and his incorporation of up-and-coming musicians, including a 14-year-old, which certainly put him out of his element.  I think he handled things like a pro.
I’m sorry you didn’t like the show, but you may have been the only one.  Did you see faces on both parents and kids after that one?
I agree with Lauren; the show was incredible! Maybe you didn’t have an awesome time, but everyone I saw there did. Such enthusiasm…I had never actively listened to them before that, and I couldn’t believe how much fun I had! Fight on Steve Miller :)
Amy, I’m almost thinking you weren’t at the right concert… Friday night was an amazing show – people were up on their feet dancing, cheering, clapping along with the band. The passion and emotion was definitely there, and he took real time to speak to the students and younger members in the audience.
I’ll agree the drummer and pianist were a little disengaged, but  who cares – Charles was great- dancing his heart out the whole show and acknowledging fans with some hand grabs. A little over the top, but genuinely fun.
Miller’s story about Les Paul, his personal experiences in the music industry, and speaking directly to student musicians in the audience were all engaging and showed the legend’s genuine desire to be there and share his music with the fans.
FYI – Students could get tickets at all levels, not just the balcony. I was sitting on the floor in the center section… for $10. I grew up listening to and loving Steve Miller Band but this was the first time I’d ever seen him live. I thought it was truly a great show and an UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME opportunity to see a huge music legend in an intimate venue for a TINY price. 5 stars from me. Thank you Thornton!
A few corrections to the article above:
Dean Cutietta did not address the audience.  That was KLOS DJ, Joe Benson.  Joe Benson acknowledged the Dean from the stage during the opening of the show and Dean Cutietta was in the audience.
The encore song that I played on was “Can’t Be Satisfied” by Muddy Waters, not “Threshold”.
It’s unfortunate that you neglected to mention that Mr. Miller, his band and his entire crew donated their time and talents so that all proceeds from the concert would benefit the Thornton School of Music.  This level of generousity, particularly when he included USC student performers into the show, is rare from any professional artist, but particularly from one of Mr. Miller’s stature.  Just a little bit of research prior to writing the article would have provided these insights and a better context in which the concert was presented.
Mr. Miller is a tremendous friend and supporter of USC and of the Thornton School and we are extremely grateful for his time in donating these two outstanding concerts.
Best regards,
Chris Sampson
Associate Dean

Last week Pope Benedict XVI announced the creation of a new policy, the Apostolic Constitution, which allows Anglicans to enter the Roman Catholic Church while maintaining their traditions. This unprecedented measure caught the world by surprise, sparking much speculation about the policy’s motives and consequences.
The pope’s nuanced strategy will further engrain the church’s current position as a highly conservative institution, while simultaneously opening its doors to the possibility of future liberalization.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Sounds contradictory? It is. In the last decade, the Anglican church has allowed priests to marry and ordained women and openly gay Anglicans. This has caused a small but continually growing population within the church to become disenchanted. It is this group of people that the pope hopes to lure.
Though the measure will surely bring more conservatives to the Catholic religion, it also represents a savvy move on the part of the pope to liberalize the church.
Anglican priests entering the Catholic clergy will have to be retrained and reordained, and given the circumstances, it seems fair to assume that they will all be very conservative. Nevertheless, a large number of these people are married; the simple fact that a Roman Catholic mass may now be run by a married man is truly revolutionary.
Pope Benedict may be criticized for by some in the church for his decisions, but he certainly knows what he is doing. Not only has he succeeded in bringing a new wave of conservative-minded priests and bishops into the church, but he has also opened Catholicism to ordained marriage in the least controversial way possible.
Another important point is the crisis of ordination within the Catholic Church. In recent years, the number of new priests has fallen critically low, with far fewer priests than ever before to staff the hundreds of thousands of churches around the world. As a result, priests are overworked, visiting multiple parishes every week. Many also feel obligated to postpone retirement to meet the needs of local churches.
By welcoming disenchanted Anglicans into the flock, Pope Benedict is refilling the Catholic clergy as quickly and efficiently as possible. It’s probable that he has also read the writing on the wall: Today’s Catholics aren’t refusing to take up the priesthood because they are less faithful than their forefathers, but because the price of giving up a family is just too high.
It may be decades before the Catholic Church considers ordaining women as priests, but the next pope will certainly be in a far better position to change policies on marriage within the clergy after Pope Benedict’s decision.
Nevertheless, not everyone is happy about the Apostolic Constitution. Many Anglicans are upset that the decision was made without consulting Anglican authorities; it appears that even the upper echelon of Anglican bishops were unaware of the Vatican’s plans.
Since the two institutions are so closely linked, there is political significance in the Vatican’s failure to contact Anglican leadership on this issue. Several African Anglican leaders, including Kenyan Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, have rejected the pope’s offer, saying that African Anglicans have resisted the liberalism that has led other Anglicans to convert.
Finally, some Catholic groups are disappointed at the pope’s continued resistance to modernization. Regardless of its long-term consequences, the Apostolic Constitution is currently driving deeper the perception that Anglicans are liberal and Catholics are conservatives. For those Catholics who are both fully modern and also attached to their Catholicism, this will continue to be a source of contention.
It will be interesting to see if the number of Catholic conversions to Anglicanism, at least by laypeople, rises in the coming years.
It has been nearly 50 years since the feminist and gay liberation movements reshaped American society. There are still plenty of people who retain a certain nostalgia for the days of cultural homogeneity and there’s nothing wrong with that.
But when the generation of young people who grew up in a socially liberal world eventually take control of the Catholic Church, it seems only a matter of time before church policies follow suit.
And while Pope Benedict may not approve, he’s taking the steps he knows are necessary to assure that the Church survives the challenges of a changing congregation.

The No. 14 USC women’s soccer team celebrated Senior Day in style Sunday, grabbing a 1-0 win over Oregon at McAlister Field.
After an upset loss to Oregon State on Friday, USC coach Ali Khosroshahin vowed to change up his lineup. He inserted leading scorer Alyssa Dávila, who usually comes off the bench, into the starting 11 to give the team an extra punch in the attacking third.
The move paid off almost immediately when Dávila gave the Women of Troy (12-5, 4-2) the lead in the 8th minute.
The junior midfielder took the ball at the top of the box, juked right and fired into the left corner of the net for her ninth goal of the season.
“It’s an easy decision when you need a little bit more work from your team to put in your leading goal scorer as a starter,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s a no-brainer.”
The Ducks (8-7-1, 0-5) created several good chances in the first half to equalize but they were unable to convert.
Their best opportunity came in the 14th minute when junior forward Jen Stoltenberg ran \ through the middle of the USC defense and hit a long shot toward goal. USC senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen got one hand on the shot and tipped it safely over the crossbar.
Both teams threatened to score in the second half but neither side put the ball into the back of the net.
In the 66th minute, Oregon senior midfielder Teresa Bowns crossed the ball into a dangerous area of the box but junior midfielder Kirstie Kuhns was unable to get her head onto the ball.
USC almost doubled its advantage in the 83rd minute when freshman forward Samantha Johnson put a well-placed cross into the box. Dávila received the ball and shot low but senior goalkeeper Jessie Proulx came up with a big save.
“I’m really happy for the seniors,” Dávila said referring to the five seniors honored. “I’m glad we were able to get the win for them.”
On Friday, the Women of Troy took a 1-0 lead into the halftime break but were overwhelmed by Oregon State (10-5-1, 2-3) in the second half, conceding two goals and losing the match 2-1.
USC looked to be in control of the game early on and grabbed the lead in the 13th minute.
Junior defender Karter Haug sent a long ball forward from the back that sophomore midfielder Carly Butcher flicked ahead to redshirt senior Marihelen Tomer. Tomer split two Beaver defenders and shot the ball low and left, past the diving goalkeeper Ashley Wood.
The Women of Troy continued to attack, forcing Wood to make four saves in the first half, but were unable to double their advantage.
The Beavers came out of the halftime break reenergized and outworked USC for most of the second half.
“[In the] first half we were decent,” Khosroshahin said. “Second half, we were non-existent.”
Oregon State leveled the score in the 54th minute, when they capitalized on a defensive error by the Women of Troy.
Beavers’ senior midfielder Red Nixon crossed in a ball from the right that USC sophomore defender Claire Schloemer chested straight down in the box. Before Schloemer was able to clear the ball, Oregon State senior midfielder Melissa Peck slid in and kicked the ball through Olsen’s fingers for the game-tying score.
“They were pressuring us like crazy in the back,” Olsen said. “We gave away the ball away too many times in the middle and that hurt us.”
Oregon State continued to apply pressure and knocked in the game-winner in the 76th minute. Redshirt freshman forward Chelsea Buckland chested down a long free kick at the top of the box that Nixon slammed into the lower right corner of the goal past a diving Olsen.
“We just got outworked,” Khosroshahin said. “They wanted it more than us today.”
After the weekend split, USC sits in fourth place in the Pac-10. The Women of Troy are in action again Friday, when they take on their cross-town rival No. 4 UCLA at 7 p.m. in Westwood.

While the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team had its 36 game winning streak snapped earlier this season, it has now replaced it with a new record.
The Trojans recorded their 37th consecutive win at home — a streak that dates back to the 2004 season — defeating No. 6 Loyola Marymount 11-4 Saturday. The win brings USC to 18-1 on the season and 5-0 in the conference.
The Trojans continued their dominance in a fashion that has become the norm this season — jumping out to an early lead and securing it for the rest of the match. Both senior driver Matthew Sagehorn and senior two-meter Shea Buckner had hat tricks, and sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka added two more goals.
“Setting the tone in the game, being the dominant team, really puts the other team back on their heels,” Sagehorn said. “It lets you feel confident and a little more dominant over them.”
USC was able to set the pace of the match early, as two penalty shots converted by Buckner and goals from Kurzeka and Sagehorn put the Trojans ahead 4-1 after the first period.
The second period featured a flurry of shots from USC, and despite strong play from LMU goalkeeper Andy Stevens, the Trojans were able to find the net three more times. Sagehorn, redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling and sophomore two-meter Matthew Burton accounted for the scores, and the Trojans entered the second half with a comfortable 7-2 advantage.
In the third, Buckner and Sagehorn were once again responsible for USC’s offensive attack, each tallying a goal. Sophomore goalie Joel Dennerley shut out the Lions in the period and recorded four saves in just three periods of play, bringing his season total to 119.
The Trojans got two more goals in the fourth period from senior driver Justin Rappel and redshirt freshman Brian Boswell, putting the game out of reach despite two late goals from LMU’s Andrew Aki.
“Our defense really starts with our goalie Joel Dennerley,” Sagehorn said. “He’s amazing, he does really well, and he’s really a facilitator out there, and he lets us all know what is going on. Our goal every game is to not let the other team score more than four goals, and we accomplished that goal today.”
The Trojans will face No. 9 UC Santa Barbara next Thursday in Santa Barbara. The match marks the sixth consecutive game for USC in which it will play a top ten team, but Sagehorn said the Trojans know how to deal with challenges.
“It’s just focusing on your concentration and putting in the extra effort,” he said.
“If we can concentrate on coming out focused, it’s gonna help us throughout the rest of the season.”

The USC women’s swim team won 132-116 in their first dual meet of the season against Oregon State on Friday.
Sophomore Ella Kidron swept both breastroke events, a USC tradition previously held by former Trojan and U.S. Olympian, Rebecca Soni. Kidron stepped up to the challenge and won the 100 meter breaststroke with a time of 1:05.25, a hair before Oregon State’s Ellie Bradley (1:05.49).
The rising sophomore took control in the 200 breaststroke, once again finishing strong with a 2:19.64, followed by sophomore teammate Ania Kowalczyk (2:22.10), who later went on to win the 200 meter individual medley (2:04.75).
“When I was swimming the 200 [breaststroke] I started to get really excited about the rest of the season,” Kidron said. “I think that helped … I was really happy with my swims.”
Kidron is establishing herself as the Women of Troy’s top competitor in the breaststroke.
“Ella stepped up and got her first dual-meet wins as a Trojan,” coach Jeremey Kipp said. “It was pretty special.”
Sophomore Katinka Hosszu started off the individual events with a come-from-behind win in the 1000 meter freestyle, breaking away from the field in the second half of the race and finishing in 9:58.07. Freshman distance specialist Haley Anderson took second (10:10.11) followed by freshman Chelsea Wild (10:12.30).
The 200 meter fly may prove to be one of USC’s most competitive events this season. The Women of Troy swept the top three places and each achieved NCAA ‘B’ cuts, which puts them into consideration for the NCAA championships. Hosszu won in 1:56.48, followed by junior transfer All-American Lindsay DePaul (1:57.49) and sophomore Tanya Krisman (1:59.90).
“Three of the top times in the country,” Kipp said, “that’s going to be a great race for us this season.”
Hosszu’s final win was in the 200 backstroke (2:00.03), demonstrating her versatility by representing the Women of Troy for the first time in this event. DePaul, who came in second (2:00.69), is also not used to the event.
DePaul posted her second NCAA ‘B’ cut of the day in the 200 freestyle in 1:49.09, with freshman Yumi So taking second (1:52.27) and the Beavers’ Whitney Iverson taking third (1:52.49). So also went on to win the 100 meter fly in 55.22.
Freshman Lili Shiota out-touched senior captain and senior All-American Dina Hegazy in the 100 meter backstroke, with Shiota clocking 57.60 and Hegazy finishing in 57.95.
Freshman Christel Simms won back-to-back sprint events, with a 23.90 splash-and-dash 50m free and clocking 51.13 in the 100 freestyle, with freshman teammate Kate Shumway coming in second (52.43).
“I felt good off my start in the 50,” Simms said. “I had a good break out [and] tried to hold my breath and just made sure I got my hand to the wall first.”
USC’s distance women once again swept top three in the 500 meter freestyle, with junior Ellie Doran leading the field until the last 50 yards when Anderson kicked and managed to out-touch her teammate by .41 seconds. Anderson clocked 4:55.54, with Doran closely behind in 4:55.95 and Wild taking third (4:59.47).
The Pac-10 opener showed off USC’s potential but didn’t reach the speed standard head coach Dave Salo was looking for.
“We’re going to have to be a lot faster if we want to beat Arizona,” Salo said, “but it’s good the women are getting the opportunity to practice dual meet format.”
The women’s team lost the opening Medley relay for the first time in nearly three years after the loss of last year’s senior relay team Kristen Lahey, Katy Houston, Rebecca Soni and Rachael Waller.
“We started off a little slow on the relay,” Kipp said. “But I think the girls quickly realized the Pac-10 is a place where you can’t start off slow.”
The team’s focus now turns to Arizona and Arizona State, who they face on Nov. 6.
“I think our attitude was the highlight,” senior captain Krissy Forelli said. “That’s what’s really going to help us when it comes to the tougher teams like Arizona.”

All things considered, Pete Carroll had no reason to complain with the end result of a win.
But the defensive-minded coach sighed slightly when discussing his team giving up season highs in points and yards allowed.
After the Trojans surged out to an early lead, USC and Oregon State swapped scores down the stretch in a shootout that left both defenses exhausted. A high-powered attack centered on a strong ground game pushed USC toward a 42-36 win against Oregon State on Saturday at the Coliseum.
The Beavers were within striking range of the Trojans in the fourth quarter, but the USC offense converted two third-downs and wiped the final five minutes off the clock to secure the win.
“This is a different game than we hoped to have,” Carroll said. “The offense carried us because we challenged them to win this game for us.”
Senior running back Allen Bradford anchored the USC running game with a career-high 147 yards on 15 carries. With starter Joe McKnight sidelined with a hand injury, Bradford became the offense’s centerpiece. He plunged into the end zone from the 2-yard line and ripped off a 43-yard run in the third quarter for his second touchdown of the day.
But even after redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown, the Beavers did not relent.
A 1-yard touchdown run by Oregon State running back Jacquizz Rodgers drew the Beavers within six, but Oregon State couldn’t cut any deeper into the Trojans’ lead.
“We really just ran out of time,” Oregon State quarterback Sean Canfield said. “At the end of the day, we just didn’t get enough big plays.”
Canfield shredded the Trojans secondary for 329 yards and three touchdowns on 30-of-43 passing. After Rodgers was temporarily sidelined by an ankle injury in the third quarter, Canfield kept the Beavers offense alive by repeatedly finding his safety valves. His favorite target, tight end Joe Halahuni, reeled in nine catches for 127 yards.
The diminutive Rodgers returned in the second-half to give the Beavers balance by rushing for 113 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries.
“We schemed the run up really well and thought that was what they were going to come out and do, especially after last year,” said linebacker Chris Galippo. “They came out early and we shut the running game down, but then they got out on us in the passing game and the perimeter game.”
The Beavers’ 36 points was the most allowed by a USC team in the Coliseum since 2005. For a USC defense that had frequently lifted a sluggish offense through the first half of the season, the role reversal came as somewhat of a surprise.
“Letting up 36 points, you can lose a lot of games that way,” said senior safety Taylor Mays. “It’s disappointing, but we have confidence in what we can do.”
Coming off a career game at Notre Dame, true freshman Matt Barkley had two touchdowns passing and ran the ball in for a score from the 1-yard line. The signal-caller’s second touchdown throw came in the second quarter when wide receiver Ronald Johnson made a diving catch in the end zone for his first score of the year.
After missing the first five games of the season with a broken collarbone and contributing sparingly against Notre Dame, the junior said the highlight reel catch provided him with relief.
“It felt like all the pressure was off me,” Johnson said. “It had been so long since I had gotten one, so it felt really good.”
Barkley also threw two interceptions, including a fourth-quarter pick that set up the Beavers’ final scoring drive.
Still in the thick of a Pac-10 title race with next week’s game against conference leader Oregon looming, the Trojans took solace in coming out of the night still poised to make a run for the league championship.
“Every week in the Pac-10 is a dogfight,” Galippo said. “You have to be ready for teams that are trying to make their season by beating you.”

Allen Bradford was ready to quit.
The bruising redshirt junior USC running back admits he considered transferring multiple times when it seemed he wasn’t working his way into the rotation.
But the words of his father, Keith, always stayed with him.
“My dad told me, ‘Life’s gonna get hard — you can’t run from it,’” Bradford said.
Instead, Bradford played true to his father’s words and ran through it, showcasing his power as he pounded Oregon State defenders and his speed as he ran past them in USC’s 42-36 win Saturday against the Beavers at the Coliseum.
In his long-awaited breakout game as a Trojan, Bradford rushed for 147 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries, his first-ever 100-yard performance. The 5-foot-11, 235-pound back is known for his power, but he showcased his speed as well on a 43-yard scoring burst in the third quarter.
Bradford entered the game in the second quarter and dominated from there. Joe McKnight, the starter, got only three carries from that point on, partly because of a hand injury but mostly because Bradford was hot.
In his first chance to be “the man,” Bradford showed what Trojan fans had been missing out on all these years.
Coming out of Colton High in California, Bradford was supposed to be the next big thing — literally — to play at USC. But a crowded backfield that included a handful of other blue chip running backs limited his chances.
He was then slowed by injuries, particularly a hip flexor that required surgery last season and forced him to redshirt.
Multiple times he felt like transferring and he wondered if he had made the wrong choice in coming to USC. But encouragement from his dad and his teammates picked him up in the same way he carried the USC offense Saturday night.
“Players like Taylor Mays, Thomas Williams — a lot of players told me, ‘Just stick it out, your time will come,’” Bradford said.
Bradford recalls back to the early season game against Idaho his sophomore year as being one of his most trying moments. Starting running back Chauncey Washington went down with an injury and Bradford expected to be the guy called upon to rise to the occasion and fill in.
But when coaches chose to give other running backs a chance instead, Bradford was dejected.
“Chauncey was hurt and I still didn’t get in,” he said. “I think that was the lowest point for me on the field. That’s when I really just thought about leaving.”
Coach Pete Carroll wasn’t quite sure what to do with Bradford when he joined the Trojans in 2006. Originally recruited as a safety, Bradford moved back to running back and also bounced around to full back during his freshman year.
He carried the ball just 13 times as a freshman and only 15 times as a sophomore. He found the end zone five times, but it wasn’t enough to keep the former prep star satisfied.
That’s why this season has been so fulfilling for Bradford. His role in the offense has been building from the opening game, and in light of the injury to Stafon Johnson, he’s getting more and more touches each game.
“It’s sad how it had to come,” Bradford said of his increased role. “I would rather have Stafon back and him not going through that than me playing more, but I just had to open the door when opportunity knocked.”
He didn’t open the door as much as run through it, establishing himself as the go-to power back that coaches can use to counter the speed of Joe McKnight.
If that sounds familiar to the “Thunder and Lightning” days of Reggie Bush-Lendale White era, that’s no accident. In fact, it’s what Carroll has been waiting for.
“I love having the tough, physical hard-nosed guy,” Carroll said. “I’ve always felt like we’ve had our best offenses when we have that guy.”
Bradford wants to be that guy and he wants to fill that role that White played to such perfection.
“I just wanna be the thunder and have Joe be the lightning,” Bradford said.
It has been a long journey to this point for Bradford, but it finally seems as if the wait has paid off. Since the words of his father helped lift him through the lower moments during his USC career, Bradford honored him by writing “I promise” on his eye black.
It is a promise to his father that Bradford will make it to the NFL one day and provide for his father so he can stop working six days a week as a janitor in San Bernardino.
It is a promise that Bradford will never quit.
It is also perhaps a promise Bradford is making to himself, a reminder that if football gets hard again, the only place he’ll be running is into the end zone.
