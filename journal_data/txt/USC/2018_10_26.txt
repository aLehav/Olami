Redshirt freshman quarterback Jack Sears will start against Arizona State on Saturday, the team announced on Friday. This will be Sears’ first game action as a collegiate quarterback. 
Freshman starting quarterback JT Daniels suffered a concussion in last week’s game against Utah, and was unable to clear protocol in time to earn the starting nod. He will likely be unavailable for this game even as a backup, as head coach Clay Helton said at Thursday’s practice that if Daniels wasn’t full strength, he wouldn’t see any action.
Redshirt sophomore Matt Fink, the second-string quarterback all season, entered the game against the Utes after Daniels’ injury. Fink led two touchdown drives before the end of the game, but suffered three broken ribs in the process. He will also be unavailable against the Sun Devils.
USC has been preparing for Sears to be the starter in practice this week, but with only one week to prepare, the team was forced to adopt a simpler game plan for its new signal-caller. 
“We went in and tried to be Simple Simon, not really creating any new concepts or ideas, but things our kids are good at. I look forward to seeing how it pans out,” Helton said Thursday. “I think [offensive coordinator] Tee [Martin] has done a nice job of just saying ‘I’m not going to reinvent the wheel, I’m going to do things we think Jack can handle.’”
In addition, the Trojans are preparing for every eventuality at the position.
“Jack has had a great week of work, as have [redshirt sophomore Thomas] Holden and [freshman] Brandon [Perdue],” Helton said. “They’re ready to go …We’ve got a lot of faith in Jack, in Holden, in Brandon to do their job.”
Helton was complimentary of Holden and Perdue’s preparation. 
“The good thing is they’ve been in the meetings, even though they haven’t gotten the physical reps,” Helton said. “We’ve carried Holden into every game as a backup quarterback. So he’s learned game plans, he’s prepared for game plans, and that’s why you train a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth quarterback, just for these situations.”

Yasmin Davis | Daily Trojan
On Oct. 19, Interim President Wanda Austin sent an email to USC students and faculty regarding the federal class-action lawsuit against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall. 
An online list of University actions and goals was linked to the email to update the community on the Tyndall case as well as review changes USC has promised to make or has already made in response. Many of these changes focus on improving the Engemann Student Health Center to include better student mental health services and be more transparent. 
At first glance, it seems like the University may not have the best intentions when making these changes. However, while some changes appear misguided, the University has implemented important changes that will ensure improved staffing in Engemann and increase the availability of mental health services to students. 
The first line of the list’s summary page reads, “USC has made sweeping changes to restore trust and heal our community.” Right off the bat, this sentence reveals the warped lens through which the University views its initiatives. It does not see these changes as a chance to improve student health services, but rather as a way to “restore trust.” This wording is troubling, as it suggests the University is more concerned with being seen as trustworthy than with reforming its health system. This phrasing brings into question the sincerity of the University’s reforms. However, some of the subsequent promises have potential to create positive change in the University’s student health program. 
Some of the changes in the plan are fairly commonsense. For instance, the website notes that “enhanced executive background” screenings have been employed for new hires and those seeking promotions. 
However, it is strange that stricter background checks weren’t already in place when important issues such as student health are at stake. USC’s  health center works with students from vulnerable backgrounds, including first-generation and international students, for whom health care services may be otherwise inaccessible. While USC’s hiring processes should have been corrected long ago, the changes are a positive step toward ensuring that students receive the most qualified, professional care.
One of the bullet points in the list of “completed measures” notes that the University has “hired two new female board-certified gynecologists and a female adolescent and young adult medicine specialist at the student health center.” The emphasis on the gender of the new staff seems to indicate that the main problem in the Tyndall case was that the University hired a male gynecologist, and that this problem can be ameliorated by hiring females. To be clear, the problem was not that Tyndall was male, but that he was a serial sexual predator. While hiring women is a step with good intentions, it is more important for USC to reevaluate its tendency to prioritize its own interests over student health.
The most impactful portion of the plan focuses on mental health. The list states that 12 additional therapists will be hired in the next two academic years. This is great step forward for Engemann, as the health center was recently featured by the Daily Trojan for referring so many patients to outside clinics. These hirings have instant benefits, as students will have more access to licenced therapists on campus, and will no longer have to go elsewhere for mental health help. If the University truly cares about restoring trust, it has started taking steps in the right direction..
Overall, while many of the measures enacted will foster positive change on campus, especially in regards to mental health, it is important to consider not only the completed reforms, but also those that are in progress. The University has a long list of “measures underway,” including its promise to hire more therapists. While it is ultimately the University’s job to enact these measures, the USC community must continue to advocate for their completion and hold the University accountable to its promises —  no USC student should feel unsafe when seeking medical attention from the University they call home.

Los Angeles has been hit hard by California’s housing crisis. A critical shortage in affordable housing is putting real economic pressure on families throughout the region, creating economic stress and making it harder to find safe, affordable places to live.
In the upcoming midterm elections, Proposition 10 threatens to make a dire situation even worse. The measure would only exacerbate the current housing crisis and make it harder to build the affordable housing necessary to meet the needs of millions of people across California.
Because the city of Los Angeles is not building enough housing to support its economic growth, people across the region are paying the price. Increased demand for housing is driving up prices. The housing supply shortage has made demand more intense and has driven down vacancy rates while driving up prices for rental units.
In the process, the shortage of available housing has impacted neighborhoods like Los Feliz and Silverlake. Over the last several years, thousands of longtime residents have been forced out of their homes as demand for housing in the area skyrockets.
Proposition 10 is the wrong approach to solving our housing crisis. Instead of providing targeted aid to those who need help, or building more housing to stabilize rents, most of the benefits of Prop 10 would by reaped by those the top of the economic ladder, while finding housing would become even more difficult for low- and middle-income residents.
Proposition 10 would make it harder to build the affordable housing the city desperately needs. Housing developers often rely on market-rate units to help fund the construction of affordable units, which they make available at controlled, below-market rates. Prop 10 would make this model untenable and prevent thousands of new housing units from being built.
To make matters worse, Prop 10 could drive down property values and cost state and local governments hundreds of millions of dollars in lost tax revenues, according to the state’s nonpartisan legislative analyst’s office. It would further cut funding for key services like education, health care and public safety, while increasing pressure for future tax increases to make up the shortfall.
Our current housing crisis is largely a problem of supply and demand — one that is worsened by Proposition 10. That’s why gubernatorial candidates Democrat Gavin Newsom and Republican John Cox have both publicly opposed Proposition 10. They know it will tie the hands of elected officials and community leaders seeking real solutions to California’s housing crisis.
Solving California’s housing crisis will take a comprehensive approach that includes protection for current tenants as well as those looking for affordable housing in the future. Unfortunately, Prop 10 is a flawed measure that would worsen many of the problems the measure attempts to solve.

Dariel Fillomeno | Daily Trojan
Relationships fall apart. It’s a dreadful, yet unavoidable lesson that every person learns. And while they often fail for various reasons, perhaps the most common — and the most difficult to accept — is when one person cheats.
For most people, infidelity is considered the ultimate dealbreaker. But can the same be said about queer men? According to a 2018 survey conducted by the Health Equality and Rights Organization, FS magazine and OutLife, 52 percent of respondents who identified as gay or bisexual admitted to cheating on their partners. Even more astonishing, 45 percent of admitted cheaters said their partner never found out.
Last weekend, a close friend informed me that one of my ex-boyfriends had cheated on me — with his current boyfriend — weeks before our breakup. 
This news came as a shock even though we ended our relationship a year ago.  To clarify, I’m no a longer teary-eyed mess every time someone brings up his name, but I still couldn’t help but reflect on the shortcomings of our two-year romance. Was I too clingy? Did I not treat him well enough? Why did he cheat on me but not own up to his actions?
Suffice it to say, I felt very betrayed. For someone who loved me as much as he said he did, it was bad enough that he cheated; but by not confessing and having me find out through a second-hand source a year later truly was the cherry on top of our broken relationship. But even as the angst consumed me (I screamed the lyrics to Alanis Morissette’s “You Oughta Know” during the car ride back from UCLA), I couldn’t help but empathize with him — because I had done the same thing in a past relationship.
Don’t get me wrong: Infidelity is undoubtedly the worst crime any person can commit against their partner, and both parties inevitably end up getting hurt. If infidelity is such a common aspect of the queer dating experience, is it really possible for men to sustain meaningful, honest relationships with each other?
Queer men have always struggled with liberating themselves from the heteronormative constructs imbedded within our cultural structures. Though they are often invisible, these ideas are detrimental to the queer experience for a variety of reasons, including the fact that they perpetuate sexual hierarchies and divisive stereotypes about men seeking relationships with men. These constructs are evident in the transformation of queer culture today: More and more LGBTQ individuals are embracing monogamous relationships and parenthood. 
While monogamy, parenthood and marriage are all equally desirable, queer people have been told their entire lives that they need to conform to the status quo, that they need to be or act a certain way to be happy, that they need to lead normal lives in order to achieve acceptance. This stereotypical image has become the omnipresent echo of society. 
Take Cam and Mitch from ABC’s “Modern Family” for example, one of the most recognizable same-sex couples in mainstream media. Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) are married, they have an adopted daughter — and they have been completely monogamous for the duration of the show. While Stonestreet and Ferguson are commendable for their multi-dimensional portrayals of gay men, Cam and Mitchell are just one of many representations of the exemplary gay couple that people expect, one almost identical to any other suburban family obsessed with the idea of a white picket fence — which is bullshit at the end of the day. The Cam and Mitch image, which was created by heterosexual showrunners, is ultimately a dangerous stereotype because it reinforces the notion that queer people must conform to a certain lifestyle in order to be generally accepted as normal by society.
As queer men, we are often told that there is an ideal we must succumb to.  Sometimes we are even shamed into thinking that there’s a right way to build relationships, families and lives. However, these attitudes are harmful since they are restrictive to maintaining healthy, open relationships. This toxic mindset may be the reason why so many queer men are susceptible to cheating, and also why they end up repeatedly cheating. Practicing monogamy is only one part of the equation, but it should not be the default.

On Wednesday, professor Emily Anderson hosted a presentation about the later adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays. (Hyeonmi Shin | Daily Trojan)
Professor Emily Anderson gave a presentation about Shakespearean adaptations by playwrights and actors seeking to boost their own popularity on Wednesday night in Mark Taper Hall of Humanities. 
Anderson started off by explaining that in the 18th century, William Shakespeare was considered a mediocre, second-string playwright whose works were nowhere near as popular as they are today. At the time, however, playwrights did not create many original works, mainly due to political pressures, and many drew inspiration from the past. As a result, some adapted Shakespeare’s work in various forms.
Most commonly, adaptations involved actively rewriting Shakespeare’s plays. Actors who performed Shakespeare’s plays put their own interpretations into scripts and altered the themes of the plays. Playwrights like David Garrick even omitted and rewrote parts of the original scripts, Anderson said. 
The adaptations created from Shakespeare’s plays drastically changed their storylines as well. 
In “The History of King Lear,” an adaptation of Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” playwright Nahum Tate turned a tragedy into a romance; while King Lear and Cordelia die in the original,  in Tate’s version, they live and Cordelia gets a romantic interest. To these playwrights, adaptation meant enhancing the core of Shakespeare’s stories. 
While the playwrights claimed to edit Shakespeare’s plays to further his glory and recognition, in reality, they acted with ulterior motives of improving their own reputations, Anderson said. She added that, by elevating Shakespeare’s status, the playwrights hoped to associate themselves with his work  and ride the coattails of his success.  
“Many 18th century adapters of Shakespeare made him, for example, conform to the contemporary artistic preference for neoclassical ideals,” Anderson said.
While Shakespeare’s plays were already hundreds of years old by the 18th century, adaptations kept them relevant and appealing to contemporary audiences. 
“Such sentiments led to some full scale Shakespeare editing, eliminating what 18th century readers saw to be confusing vocabulary or obsessive metaphor,” Anderson said. 
After the presentation, the event opened up for discussion, during which the notion of adaptations changing the way consumers view an original text became a recurring topic. 
“The play has an afterlife precisely because it can be rewritten,” Anderson said.

“Boy Erased” is slated for release Nov. 2. The drama stars Lucas Hedges as Jared Eamons and follows his journey undergoing conversion therapy. (Photo from IMDb)
During a screening of “Boy Erased” Wednesday night, laughter occasionally filled the ornate Ray Stark Family Theatre. 
Yet “Boy Erased” is not a comedy. 
In fact, a story about a young boy’s journey through conversion therapy, it’s rightfully and painfully somber. The film, based on the eponymous memoir by Garrard Conley, takes place in early 2000s Arkansas, a region dominated by Christian fundamentalism. The prospect of homosexuality brings legitimate indignation from community members and prompts abhorrent solutions. 
But, being screened on a college campus in California in 2018, the mere idea of the events depicted is so inconceivable, so backwards and contemptible, that one can’t help but nervously laugh in disbelief. From testing the boys’ handshakes to mandating a chaperone for bathroom visits, the bizarre conversion techniques depicted stun unfamiliar viewers, making the film both educational and enthralling. 
“Boy Erased” begins as Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges) checks in with his mother (Nicole Kidman) to Love in Action, a gay conversion therapy center run by Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton), a former “convert.” The film interlaces Jared’s present-day experiences with flashbacks of him discovering his sexuality and coming out to his preacher father (Russell Crowe).
While the atrocities of conversion therapy have been known for some time, “Boy Erased” shines an intimate light on the practice, highlighting the zeal with which community members and pastors persecute LGBTQ youth. Yet, the program participants’ own internalizations of the community’s hatred are most appalling. For instance, Jared says he sometimes imagines he’s Job from the Bible, and that God and the devil are betting over who will get his soul. 
The film also demonstrates the small community’s blatant misunderstanding of queerness. After sending Jared to conversion therapy, his father calls a doctor to test Jared’s blood for low levels of testosterone. The doctor tells Jared that while she’s a devout Christian, she also went to medical school and is sure that he’s a perfectly healthy young man.
“Boy Erased” also exposes the sheer absurdity of the quasi-scientific tactics used in conversion therapy. For instance, while a genogram, a family tree listing psychological factors and life events, can be a legitimate tool in sociology and social work, the conversion center perverts the idea. Participants must instead track behavioral sins in their family history to deduce why they are gay. Without a concrete history of behavioral sins in his family, Jared decides he must lie and pretends his uncle was an alcoholic. 
Fresh off supporting roles in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” and “Lady Bird,” Hedges masterfully conveys a desperate fear and sense of self-loathing as Jared during conversion therapy. In flashbacks that punctuate the film, Hedges displays an amalgamation of self-discovery and anxiety without overtly communicating his character’s thoughts and affections. 
Throughout, subtleties in Hedges’ performance demonstrate Jared’s internal processing of his situation. With each character Jared meets, his frustration builds, occasionally released in brief fits of resentment. 
One particularly arresting moment comes when Jared goes on a nighttime run to clear his mind. He stumbles upon a sexualized men’s cologne advertisement. Jared first looks at the ad with indignation, as if he could never escape his “sinful” thoughts; then, for a moment, he places his hand longingly over the man’s face. Following this brief moment of vulnerability, Jared hurls a rock at the ad, screaming expletives into the man’s shattered face and into the heavens. 
Kidman’s performance as Nancy, Jared’s mother, reveals the difficult mental state of a woman who wants to support her son as well as her orthodox husband. This contradiction comes to a head when her husband brings another preacher home to help pray her son’s homosexuality away. 
During this scene, Nancy sits, looking ashamed and helpless, while Pastor Wilkins (Frank Hoyt Taylor) holds Jared’s hand and says, “We pray, God, that you make him pure.” 
Director Joel Edgerton contributes a harrowing performance as the despicable Victor Sykes, who torments the boys in the conversion program but still maintains the facade that he’s trying to help them. Edgerton understands the loathsome nature of Sykes and the control he imposes over the young boys’ lives. After seeing some of Jared’s books from college — such as “Lolita” and “The Picture of Dorian Gray” — Sykes tells Jared in a private meeting that spending a year at the conversion program might be a better choice than going to college. 
While “Boy Erased” focuses on a real, intimate story, the film becomes a conduit for learning about the thousands of young people still subjected to such programs every year. The other program attendees in the film include: a boy determined to just fake it until he can run away (Troye Sivan), a girl forced into conversion therapy housing (Jesse LaTourette), a boy repeating the therapy when it didn’t take the first time (Xavier Dolan) and a boy who commits suicide after being publicly chastised (Britton Sear).
For every wildly misinformed, laughter-inducing scene, an equally abhorrent scene follows, demonstrating the real-life consequences of the often-unbelievable therapy. The end credits for the film state that over 700,000 Americans have undergone such programs. “Boy Erased” provides a passionate and humanizing look at Jared Eamon’s story, but it’s still just one of many — and that’s nothing to laugh at.

On Wednesday night, Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center hosted “The City of Others,” a performance by acclaimed Afro-Colombian dance group Sankofa Danzafro. (Photo courtesy of Visions and Voices)
Passersby would be forgiven for wondering whether the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center had turned into a nightclub Wednesday at 3 p.m. and again at 7:30 p.m. Sankofa Danzafro, an Afro-Colombian dance group from Medellín, Colombia, performed a piece called “The City of Others,” that explored the struggles  people of color in urban communities face, replete with thumping, rhythmic music. 
In Akan, a Ghanian language, Sankofa means “to return to the root,” and “The City of Others” fully embodied the word’s etymology and philosophy. In addition to the high-energy techno beats inspired by Latin and hip-hop music, a portion of the choreography was set to Vallenato music, a popular genre of Colombian folk music where the plaintive, mournful crooning of one of the dancers was accompanied by djembes, a West African goblet drum, and maracas. 
The choreography also seamlessly integrated the traditional and the contemporary. Age-old dances such as the Bullerengue, the Currulao and the Abozao transitioned into the kind of moves found on the dance floor at a frat party. 
The heavy emphasis on history and lineage was incongruous with the dancers’ costumes, which were the standard business casual attire one might find in a corporate environment — ties and button down shirts tucked into slacks. They alluded to the daily 9-to-5 grind, a routine familiar to city dwellers. However, the dancers’ feet remained bare, suggesting a tie, however faint, to their ancestral roots. 
The most impressive aspect of “The City of Others” was the dancers’ stamina; they were able to maintain their intensity for a full hour. The group was small, comprising only 12 dancers — five women and seven men. But the energy demanded of them by the choreography was that of a full corps. The program, which was full of leaps, stomps and kicks, involved expansive, expressive gestures. There was no half-hearted going-through-the-motions, no listlessness or signs of fatigue; each performer gave 110 percent, all the way through to the final bows. In a venue as small and intimate as Kaufman’s space, the dancers’ strength and spirit were infectious. At the end, the audience stood up to unleash a thunderous round of applause. 
Afterward, Kaufman Vice Dean Jodie Gates, Sankofa Danzafro artistic director Rafael Palacios and two dancers, who took the stage still in costume and struggling to catch their breath, held a Q&A session. Through a translator, Palacios, who spoke in Spanish, relayed his inspiration for the choreography — the hostility, loneliness and discrimination he experienced living in Medellín — and how he wanted to examine the treatment of African diaspora communities living in Colombia as second class citizens. 
It’s clear from Sankofa Danzafro’s popularity (The New York Times called the show a “revelation”) that their mission and message has resonated with audiences beyond Medellín, and that marginalized people from all walks of life can relate to its message of rising up, claiming the political and social power that has been denied to them for so long, and declaring — this is everyone’s city.

Freshman 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt scored 26 goals so far in his first season at USC. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Following two decisive victories against top-10 opponents in Long Beach State and Pepperdine last weekend, the No. 1 men’s water polo team will compete against former players Saturday before taking on Pacific University this Sunday.
The annual Water Polo Alumni Day involves both men’s and women’s programs. The women’s game will kick off at 9 a.m., while the men will play at 10 a.m. for alumni who graduated before 2007 and 11 a.m. for those from 2008-2018. During Saturday’s festivities, the water polo program will celebrate the 20th anniversary of its first national championship victory in 1988.
After Alumni Day, the Men of Troy will face a non-conference opponent in Pacific. Pacific enters the week as a top-10 team. Despite a 9-8 record, they are undefeated in conference play. The Tigers narrowly defeated No. 5 UC Santa Barbara before suffering a tough loss at No. 2 Stanford this past weekend.
In the previous matchup between USC and Pacific on Sept. 22, the Tigers propelled themselves to a strong early lead, ending the first period with a 4-1 advantage over the Trojans. However, the Men of Troy demonstrated their resilience in a comeback with five straight Trojan goals in the second period. After pulling ahead of the Tigers, the Trojans never conceded their lead. The match ended in an 11-8 USC victory, one of the toughest victories this season.
“I think [this] weekend we just want to improve on making our easy opportunities, putting them away and not wasting any chances,” sophomore driver Marko Vavic said. “We need to make sure we capitalize on those.” 
On Sunday, the Trojan defense must be wary of Pacific’s redshirt junior utility Luke Pavillard. Pavillard posted 2 goals against the Trojans in their last encounter, and leads his team in scoring so far this season with 55 goals through 17 games. Another offensive threat for the Tigers is junior attacker Engin Ege Colak, who has put up 53 goals in 17 games.
To counter the Tigers’ attack, the Trojans will look to whoever is in the cage. Freshman goalie Nic Porter is third in the MPSF in average goals allowed per game with 6.84. 
Although defense has been one of the Trojans’ focal points this season, the team also recognizes the importance of finishing its chances on the other end of the pool. This was an area the Trojans struggled in during the first period against Pacific.
Vavic sets an example for his teammates in this regard, as he has been the Trojans’ top scorer over the past two seasons. Last Sunday, Vavic reached 100 goals, an impressive mark for a player who has not yet completed his second season. He and the other returning players, including senior driver Zach D’Sa, will lead the Trojan attack this weekend.
Along with tactical preparation geared specifically toward Pacific, the Trojans have continued to focus on sharpening their critical skills.
“We’re just trying to improve on the basic fundamentals of the game every day at practice,” freshman 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt said. “At this point, we just need to keep doing what we’re doing. We know how to win, and we just need to continue to do that.”
USC’s match against Pacific begins at 1 p.m. at Uytengsu Aquatic Center on Sunday.

Senior forward Leah Pruitt scored the only goal in USC’s 1-0 win over Colorado on Thursday. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Women of Troy pulled off a narrow 1-0 victory in Boulder against Colorado Thursday to improve their record to 15-1-1 on the season.
The game remained close until the end. Senior forward Leah Pruitt scored the lone goal just 24 minutes into the game. The goal started with movement from redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo as she found sophomore midfielder Tara McKeown at the top of the box. 
McKeown then looked to freshman forward Penelope Hocking, who put a shot on goal to force a save. Pruitt was there to get the rebound and find the back of the net — marking her 11th goal of the season. Pruitt leads the team in points with 30, and has the second most goals behind Hocking. Pruitt also sits in the top four in the Pac-12 in goals scored. 
The Buffaloes posed a threat in the final minutes of the match when the ball hit the post on a one-on-one chance. Luckily for the Women of Troy, redshirt keeper Kaylie Collins grabbed the ball on the rebound to prevent the Buffaloes from scoring. The save allowed the Trojans to claim their sixth win, and end the game notching five saves.
The Trojans managed to log 20 shots, 12 on target. Colorado, on the other hand, struggled with only 5-of-13 shots on goal.
The win against Colorado marks the fourth season that the team has secured at least 15 victories under head coach Keidane McAlpine. McAlpine has once again proved his pedigree as one of the top soccer coaches in the nation. 
Following their victory over the Buffaloes, the Trojans will travel to Salt Lake City to face the Utes Sunday for another Pac-12 matchup.
Utah has been inconsistent this season, holding a record of 8-8-1. They fell to the Bruins Thursday night by a score of 5-1. Utah has had mixed results throughout the season. They beat Washington State 2-1 when the Cougars were No. 7 in the nation, but they also lost to Oregon 1-0. It will be interesting to see how the Utes fare against the Trojans following a 10-goal weekend from the Women of Troy.
Throughout the season, Utah has scored 22 goals and have conceded 20. The Utes average over a goal per game, and, after their blowout loss to the Bruins, concede a little over a goal per game as well. The clash will be interesting since the Trojans score nearly three goals a game and concede less than half a goal per game.
The Utes will need senior midfielder Paola Van Der Veen — their most notable player — to play her A-game. Van Der Veen, originally from the Netherlands, has earned 16 points this season for the Utes, scoring seven goals and notching two assists. Junior forward Ireland Dunn also cannot be overlooked, as she is the creative spark for the team with a total of 15 points from 4 goals and seven assists. 
The Utes’ impressive defensive record can be attributed to junior goalkeeper Carly Nelson who saves over 80 percent of the shots she faces. Both Nelson and USC’s redshirt sophomore keeper Kaylie Collins have similar save percentages of over 80 percent. Nelson, however, has faced nearly twice as many shots on goal than Collins.
Overall, Utah will be a force to be reckoned with. McAlpine has said past that every Pac-12 game on the road is a hard one, and Utah is no different. 
The Trojans will look to maintain their good form over the past few games. USC will face Utah Sunday at 11 a.m. in Salt Lake City.

Redshirt sophomore receiver Tyler Vaughns scored two touchdowns against ASU last year on Oct. 28. (Daily Trojan file photo)
With Saturday’s face-off quickly approaching, the Daily Trojan got an inside look at ASU’s tactics through a conversation with State Press football beat writer Jacob Rosenfarb.
Daily Trojan: Do you think that Arizona State’s 4-3 record is an accurate reflection of their performance thus far?
Jacob Rosenfarb: While a 3-4 record isn’t ideal after seven games, it’s relatively indicative of the Sun Devils’ performance. If a few plays go different in each of Arizona State’s four one-score losses, they are looking at a very different season, but overall this is a pretty average football team. 
DT: Who are the players on each side of the ball for the Sun Devils that USC fans should look out for?
JR: On the offensive side, Arizona State possesses a high-caliber group of wide receivers highlighted by junior N’Keal Harry. Standing at 6-foot-4 with breakaway speed, Harry is one of the more electric players in the conference and will likely see his name called in the first round of this year’s upcoming NFL Draft. 
Defensively, the Sun Devils feature a number of intriguing starters, one of whom is true freshman linebacker Merlin Robertson. Thrown in the fire since week one, Robertson has played with a poise typically reserved for players three years his senior. Look for him to make an impact up the middle in the run game, then shift to the edge come third down to rush the passer. 
DT: The Sun Devils are winless on the road. What makes road games such a struggle for them, and do you expect this loss streak to continue against the Trojans?
JR: Arizona State’s 0-3 record on the road is disappointing, but much of that has to do with the opponent rather than the Sun Devils’ performance. Washington, Colorado and San Diego State are all at worst equal in talent level to Arizona State, and in the Huskies’ and Buffs’ cases, significantly more talented.
While crucial mistakes cost the Sun Devils chances in each of their road losses this season, it’s still a stretch to imagine they pull all three out. 
DT: All of ASU’s losses have come by 7 points, and they are 1-4 in one-possession games. Why do the Sun Devils have issues in close contests?
JR: I don’t believe Arizona State has problems in close games per say, they are just the type of team to play in a lot of them. 
Arizona State quarterback Manny Wilkins is one of the least turnover-prone quarterbacks in the country, only throwing two interceptions to his 11 touchdowns. But, the defense has struggled at taking away the ball, only registering seven turnovers all season. 
Almost every game the Sun Devils have played this season have come down to ball control and time of possession, and that’s how they find themselves at 3-4. 
DT: Which team will walk away with the win?
JR: As concerning as the Trojans’ quarterback situation currently looks, I don’t believe the Sun Devils have the ability to capitalize, so I’m picking a USC victory. Like all of Arizona State’s games this season, I anticipate another close matchup but ultimately I believe the Trojans will come away with the victory, 28-21.

Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman recorded two touchdowns against Colorado on Oct. 13. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
As the Trojans come off an ugly loss in Utah, they look to right the ship at home against Arizona State on Saturday after a performance that left unanswered questions. 
The team surrendered a two-touchdown lead, giving up 34 unanswered points as Utah stormed back to win the game in convincing fashion. The Trojans now stand at 4-3 with slim chances of making the Pac-12 Championship. 
They’ll have the perfect opportunity to get back on track this week, as they face a struggling 3-4 ASU team at the Coliseum, where the Trojans still hold the second longest home game win streak in college football. 
“This is a big Pac-12 game that keeps you tied up at the top [of the Pac-12 South], and it’s a game that we need,” head coach Clay Helton said.
USC offense vs. ASU defense
USC’s lack of offensive identity manifested against Utah when the defense failed to find a way to move the ball. The run game remained stagnant, just like it had the previous week, as they faced a dominant Utah rush defense. The team gained only 73 yards on 31 carries but most of that yardage came in garbage time. 
The offensive line has struggled to create any kind of consistent push off the ball in the run game for weeks, making it difficult for running backs senior Aca’Cedric Ware, sophomore Stephen Carr or redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai to get going in the past two contests. The passing game fared just as poorly against Utah which presented a major issue as that had been the Trojans’ only source of offense the previous week. The deep ball that had been so successful against Colorado vanished, as freshman quarterback JT Daniels went 6-of-16 for 89 yards and threw two interceptions. A hit late in the second half knocked him out of the game with a concussion. His status for the ASU game is still unclear. As of Thursday, Daniels had not cleared concussion protocol. If he isn’t able to play, sophomore quarterback Jack Sears will take his first game snaps as a Trojan after redshirt sophomore Matt Fink broke his ribs against Utah.
“He was able to throw a few routes on air today, but he has not been cleared for contact,” Helton said after Thursday’s practice. “With it being late in the week and still not cleared, its 50/50 at best if he’s even cleared. It’s probably leaning more toward not.”
The way the coaching staff approaches the offensive game plan will probably vary heavily based on which quarterback begins the game under center. If Daniels is the starter, expect the offense to try to replicate what worked for them against Colorado with an explosive deep passing game. 
“I think [head coach Tee Martin has] done a nice job of saying, ‘Hey we’re not going to reinvent the wheel, we’re going to do things that [Sears] can handle,’” Helton said. 
The one thing that has worked for the Trojans is junior receiver Michael Pittman — he’s been the only consistent bright spot on the offense, as he’s gone for 262 yards and three touchdowns in the last two contests.
Luckily for the Trojans, they’ll face a Sun Devil defense that’s ranked No. 65 in pass defense and No. 66 in rushing defense, offering them the perfect opponent against which to find their groove.
“I thought we paid ultra attention to detail this week on trying to get fundamental technique things fixed, so we’re not losing those one on one battles that we lost last week,” Helton said.
ASU offense vs. USC defense
The ASU offense is a three-headed monster, led by redshirt senior quarterback Manny Wilkins. Wilkins has played at a high level this year, completing about 63 percent of his passes for nearly 1,800 yards and 11 touchdowns compared to only two interceptions. 
He benefits from having one of the best receivers in the country to throw to in junior N’Keal Harry, who will likely be the first receiver to have his name called in next year’s NFL Draft. Harry is a dynamic force on the outside, with tremendous size at 6-foot-4 and special explosiveness. He’s accumulated 572 yards and six touchdowns on the year. The duo will be a tough challenge for a USC secondary that was shredded last weekend, as Utah junior quarterback Tyler Huntley torched them for 341 yards and four touchdowns. 
Both USC safeties struggled mightily against Utah. Senior Marvell Tell and freshman Talanoa Hufanga both found themselves lost in coverage and missing tackles badly throughout the night. 
One of the few bright spots for the Trojan pass defense from last week was the performance of the pass rush, which collected five sacks despite having been subpar throughout the year and losing their best player in senior linebacker Porter Gustin due to injury. 
However, the tackling defense displayed will be a serious problem if it carries into this matchup. Sun Devils sophomore running back Eno Benjamin is a playmaker in the backfield, with 753 yards and seven touchdowns. His ability to make defenders miss in open space could be a serious issue for the Trojan defense if they play like they did last week.
“They’ve had a good week of preparation and now it’s time to go play the game,” Helton said. “It’s going to be fun to play in the daylight and be back in the Coliseum.” 
Prediction: USC 24, ASU 20
Though in their current condition it’s not a stretch to think USC could lose to any team, especially if Daniels can’t play, expect them to find a way to keep their home win streak alive. The ASU defense shouldn’t be too tough of a challenge, allowing the offense to find a bit of a groove and for Daniels to regain some confidence. Though the ASU offense features serious playmakers across the board, the USC defense will likely continue to bring a solid pass rush and improve their tackling.  Expect them to pull this one out — although it might not be in impressive fashion.

USC has five games left in the 2018 season, and through the first seven games, one thing has become abundantly clear: USC does not deserve to play in a big game this year. Nearly every one of the Trojans’ wins has been a nail-biter because this USC team does not know how to adapt to any situation.
As Floyd Mayweather once said, “A true champion can adapt to anything.” 
The USC football team is not a true champion. The best coaches are able to recognize not only what their team is doing wrong, but also identify how the opposing team is succeeding in order to respond effectively. 
Last week in Salt Lake City, there was a glaring lack of adequate mid-game coaching. The Trojans spent the full 60 minutes with the same offensive approach they entered the game with. Utah’s defense is well-coached, and like any well-coached defense, they anticipated USC’s offensive approach and were ready to adapt to any game-time changes.
“Tonight was a night where another team again comes in and totally changes their character to defeat what they felt was the strength of our offense,” offensive coordinator Tee Martin said after the Utah game.
It was extremely frustrating to hear the responses from the USC coaching staff following the Utah game as a sports journalist. I thought to myself, “How do you not change your game plan when you realize it isn’t working?”  
“I thought they did a nice job with their defensive front, played a lot more cover two than I thought they would play tonight,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Their front played extremely well tonight. We did not run the ball to our capability and that’s on me.” 
Also take Martin’s roundabout response to my question regarding the failure to convert on third down.
“We weren’t converting,” Martin said. “Different things, I have to look at the tape.”
Reviewing film is important because a lot is missed in the action of the game. However, that excuse is quickly getting old. The USC coaching staff needs to learn to adapt mid-game. 
Albert Einstein once defined insanity as repeatedly doing the same thing and expecting different results.
If the coaching staff doesn’t start making mid-game changes soon, I will be compelled to officially deem this coaching staff insane because every game, the same offensive scheme is run play after play, after play.
It is absolutely ridiculous that it is still probable, let alone possible, for the Trojans to make a Pac-12 Championship because they definitely don’t deserve to play in a big game. My projection: USC is going to be able to beat the final four Pac-12 teams they play, ending with a 7-2 conference record, while Utah will lose a conference game to either Colorado or Oregon, which will grant USC sole control of the Pac-12 South.
USC is most likely going to play at Levi’s Stadium at the end of November. When they do, they will be demolished by the superior competition from the North. None of USC’s Pac-12 victories have been convincing. If there had been an extra 15 minutes of play in each of USC’s wins, I would predict that USC would hold an 0-5 Pac-12 record — a testament to the teams inability to adapt. 
The Trojans are very fortunate that the remainder of their conference schedule features three teams with losing records because right now I have less than zero trust in the USC coaching staff to beat any team that knows how to adapt to an opponent’s strengths.

Doctoral candidate Emmanuel Johnson is collaborating with two professors to create a virtual human that can help low-income populations with learning negotiation skills. (Deanie Chen | Daily Trojan)
Doctoral candidate and Fulbright Scholar Emmanuel Johnson is collaborating with Jonathan Gratch, the director of virtual human research at the Institute for Creative Technologies, and Peter Kim, a professor at the Marshall School of Business, to create virtual humans that can mimic the art of negotiation. 
The three are examining methods to develop a better understanding of the human psyche. The group hopes to publish a working model that can be used to teach low-income individuals negotiation tactics, according to Kim.
“One of the goals [of] the [National Science Foundation] grant that we received is to help underrepresented minorities who wish to succeed in STEM-related fields,” Kim said. “And so one of the goals points to sorting organizations you want to join. You need some basic negotiation skills and to be able to negotiate jobs effectively as you enter into these organizations.”
Johnson said that his motivation to conduct this research was based off of personal encounters with the negative effect of inexperienced negotiation in America and his home country of Liberia.
“You think about a negotiation as something that we do every day. And so I saw it as a very critical skill to have, to teach, because many things have been negatively impacted by bad negotiations,” Johnson said. “We look at a lot of urban cities in America, even in Liberia, and so my thinking was, if you can teach people how to negotiate better, maybe I could help them not get taken advantage of.” 
The team has developed the virtual human using game theory principles as a foundation, while adding on self-learning techniques to improve the program’s response width. Johnson said the concept of game theory provides a strong starting point for reasoning about multi-agent decision-making. 
“Once we have a model based on game theory ideas, we can build a system using various AI techniques that responds in a very natural way, as well as make offers that are appropriate,” Johnson said. 
Although the research has many academic implications, according to Gratch, the team is optimistic about the virtual human’s applications in other practical areas.
“We want to explore the idea that AI could negotiate a car for you, or your salary,” Gratch said. “So part of what we’re looking at is how the system negotiates on our behalf, and also the concept of negotiation as a new paradigm where machine and people can interact rather than a person versus machine.”  
While conducting research with his colleagues, Johnson recalled all the valuable lessons he’s learned for his academics and his future career path.
“I got guidance as well as the validity that the system that I’m building is actually teaching that something that can be taught in the classroom,” Johnson said. “As Professor Gratch and I think about how to design these systems, Professor Kim helps us make sure that is grounded in actual practice.” 
The virtual human is still undergoing simulation and tests and will require some time before it is ready for public appearance. However, the three are continuing to work on the model and hope to release the negotiating virtual human in the near future.

A new two-year fellowship called the Los Angeles Orchestra Fellowship aims to diversify American orchestras. The fellowship was created by the USC Thornton School of Music, Inner City Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. The four recipients had their first performance as a quartet Tuesday at Newman Recital Hall. 
The program’s goal is to provide training and support to musicians from underrepresented backgrounds in orchestra, including Latinx, black and Native people. Black people and Latinos each account for less than 3 percent of professional orchestras, according to the League of American Orchestras. 
To increase diversity in these ensembles, the program offers underrepresented students performance training with faculty members at Thornton, a chance to rehearse and perform with LACO and the opportunity to mentor young musicians from the local community involved in ICYOLA. 
“We’re doing everything we can to be sure they’re going into the profession, but then they are also acting as role models for students of color in this pipeline in ICYOLA,” Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta said.
Despite initial concerns that students wouldn’t apply for the program, many applicants who auditioned in January. The very first fellowship class includes violinist Sydney Adedamola, violinist Ayrton Pisco, violist Bradley Parrimore and cellist Juan-Salvador Carrasco.
“It’s great to see how dedicated they are because they had a concert earlier in the week, and then this [Visions & Voices Event Tuesday night], and then they continued to rehearse for their next thing after their concert last night so they’re working super hard,” LACO Director of Marketing Justus Zimmerman said. “It’s exciting to see them see the opportunity for all it’s worth and run with it.” 
Fellowship recipients receive housing, utilities, travel funds to attend auditions and a full scholarship to attend Thornton’s Graduate Certificate program. The program receives funding through a $750,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which seeks to strengthen the importance of the humanities and arts to the well-being of societies. 
“White players for a long time have been prepared by their upbringing and their professional network and a lot of players/musicians of color don’t have access to those same networks or same socializing,” Zimmerman said. “The goal is to make sure that when they go out for auditions, they win them and are prepared and on a level playing field by the time they get there.” 
The idea for the program was conceived last year when Cutietta met with leaders from ICYOLA and LACO. After brainstorming ways to diversify orchestras, they came up with the idea of requesting funding to support students who needed help transitioning from college to their professional careers. 
“Sometimes you’re just around a table and you know you’ve hit it,” Cutietta said. “This was such a perfect combination that, for the first time, I left that meeting and said ‘We’ll get funding for this, no doubt.’”
Cutietta said the program only has enough funding for two to three more years — its  founders will have to demonstrate its success in order to receive more funding. Cutietta said that to them, success will be measured by the students who secure permanent jobs in professional orchestras. He also hopes the younger mentees will follow a similar path by pursuing a career in classical music. 
“I appreciate [the fellowship’s] efforts to remain practical because often in the arts, leading a life as a musician, a lot of the feedback you get is about being the best musician you can be and it’s really focused on that,” Carrasco said. “That’s great because that should be a main priority but it’s really nice to have a presence in your life saying, ‘OK, but we actually want to support you getting a job and being able to make a living and having a life in this field, in the context of the real world.’”

Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity was put on interim suspension Wednesday for alleged drug use, according to the USC Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development site. This discipline measure follows the suspension of four other fraternities this school year. 
While the Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards conducts an investigation, Pi Kappa Alpha, commonly known as Pike, is banned from all chapter operations,  including hosting social events.
Pi Kappa Alpha and the Interfraternity Council declined to comment and directed the Daily Trojan to the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, which also declined to comment.
On Oct. 18, Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity, which was also placed on interim suspension for alleged hazing, filed a lawsuit against USC stating the University violated California law and University policy. 
Phi Sigma Kappa president Bradley Billig said the University refused to notify the fraternity of the specific events that are put under investigation. The fraternity will appear in court on Dec. 7.
“Organizations that are being investigated for alleged violations of the code of conduct can be instructed to suspend or modify social activities pending results of an investigation,” USC said in a statement to the Daily Trojan on Oct. 18.
Sigma Alpha Mu, Alpha Epsilon Pi and Pi Kappa Phi have also faced interim suspension for hazing allegations.

Miriam Mesa, a director from the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights LA, led the workshop. (Joesph Su | Daily Trojan)
Victor Cruz believes there’s a pressing need for education and visibility surrounding immigrant rights on campus. To present these topics, Cruz, who is pursuing a graduate degree in public administration and serves as the programming chair of the Price Latino Student Association, helped organize a “Know Your Rights” workshop Thursday. 
The event — in partnership with the Latino Law Student Association and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights — aimed to educate students on what to do when confronted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“[This is] just bringing knowledge that people have sacrificed in the past in order to ensure that we … are bringing visibility to [our] rights and preparing us to put [them] into action,” Cruz said. “Because it’s one thing to know you have a right, but it’s another thing to exercise it.”
Miriam Mesa, a director from CHIRLA, conducted the workshop and focused on rights awareness, specifically regarding confrontations with immigration authorities.
“I’ve seen a lot of pain a lot of hurt in families, and it’s really heartbreaking,” Mesa said. “Our idea [at CHIRLA] is to empower the community and to fight for themselves. If we don’t stand up for ourselves, no one else will do it.”
Mesa advised attendees to coordinate with law enforcement in situations like protests.
“When you organize a march or protest, you have to go through the proper channels, get the permits and once you do that you have less chances of getting detained,” Mesa said. “[In California], local law enforcement cannot use funding and share information with the Department of Homeland Security.”
Mesa also presented tips to the students, including what to do when ICE shows up at their homes or workplaces. 
“[People] have the right to not open the door and [can] ask the officers to slide documents from underneath the door,” Mesa said. “They cannot force the door, break it down, kick your door. But if you open the door, then that’s an invitation. You have the right to remain silent.”
Cruz said he helped plan this event because he thinks USC should be more proactive in understanding its community.
“It’s really important to realize that this power dynamic, that is authority does not just play out politically, but there are so many different ramifications that come from this,” Cruz said. “How does it affect somebody’s mental health, how does it affect someone’s visibility or incorporation in the community? How does someone affect their civic engagement?”
The PLSA hopes events like these will lead to systemic changes at USC.
“We’re trying to create programs that do not leave this outgoing class with the intention that the university and administration will catch on,” Cruz said.
The workshop was open to everyone, but specifically geared toward Latinx immigrants and their allies.
“I really want allies to feel welcome and to recognize the struggles that our communities have,” Cruz said. “Acting in solidarity with our communities is really advocating for our wellbeing, and leveraging the privilege that they have … they can probably help excel, push forward, faster than we can.”
Alina Borja, a student pursuing a graduate degree in planning who attended and helped plan the event, said events like these are crucial. She said she believes that there are more people on campus who have ties to the undocumented community than may be assumed. 
“I think it’s important for everyone to know this kind of information,” Borja said. “It was especially helpful for me because I do come from a mixed status family and I would like to know everything I can learn to protect my family and hopefully get them on a path to citizenship.”
