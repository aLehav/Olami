USC will grant partial room and meal plan refunds for the period of March 23 through the end of the semester for students who have left campus, USC Housing announced in an email to students and their families Friday. The University has also devised a schedule for when students can return to campus to retrieve their belongings.
“We realize you had to move out of your housing situation very quickly and that it’s been an unsettling time with much uncertainty,” Senior Vice President of Administration David Wright and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp wrote in the email.
USC will begin processing reimbursements next week, and changes are to be reflected in student accounts by the end of the month, according to the email. Those who are billed monthly for housing will not be charged for the remaining months in their agreement. The reimbursements will first address any outstanding charges on student accounts.
Those who remain in USC housing will not be eligible for housing reimbursement but will be refunded for any unused dining dollars. However, current residents will have the opportunity to end their contract early with no penalties and will receive credit after they have completed the checkout process.
USC has developed a calendar system for students to retrieve their belongings based on floor and assignment numbers to follow social distancing protocols. The period will begin April 27 and end May 22. It will not include the final exam period. Assistance for moving belongings into storage will begin May 31. 
“We have designed a move-out plan that balances your safety, the well-being of our staff and local community, and your understandable eagerness to obtain your belongings,” the email read. “With the State of California under a stay-at-home order, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending against any large gatherings well into May, we understand that these move-out options may be less than ideal for students and families.”
Those who are unable to return to campus can send an email to USC Housing to request that their belongings be packed and stored. Requests will be completed after residents who are able to return to campus have retrieved their belongings. The Office of Basic Needs will also assist residents for whom returning to campus may present a financial hardship. 
There are currently more than 1,600 students remaining on campus, according to the email. The University said it will accommodate students for the summer should they need housing and has agreed to open up space for emergency workers in Los Angeles should the need for space arise. Keck Medicine of USC health officials and first responders currently occupy some of the spaces in USC Hotel, along with several students.
“Again, we appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through these challenging times together,” the email read. “We can’t wait to welcome you all back to campus and we will continue to do all we can to support you in the meantime.”

Price School of Public Policy Dean Jack Knott will step down from his position and accept a role as dean of New York University’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development beginning Aug. 1. 
“As we prepare for interim leadership of the School and consider what our future may hold, I want to share my absolute confidence in this team,” Knott wrote in an email to the Price community. “I have long admired your dedication, hard work and sense of civic responsibility and service. Your ideals are needed more than ever in the world at large, and I can’t wait to see how the Price School continues to make a difference.”
Knott has worked as dean of the Price school for 15 years, developing new academic programs and expanding collaboration among schools and international universities. During his tenure, Knott has created five centers and institutes, according to an email Provost Charles Zukoski sent to the USC community to commemorate Knott’s time at the University.  
“Over the past 15 years, Dean Knott has provided inspirational and innovative leadership to grow the Price School into one of the top public policy schools in the country,” Zukoski wrote in the email. “The school consistently generates vital influence on policy and society through the research and expertise of its nationally-renowned faculty and high-achieving, impact-focused students.”
As dean, Knott encouraged philanthropy, helping to secure charitable gifts as well as the Price school’s $50 million endowment. The school also elevated its national ranking under Knott, moving to No. 3 from No. 7 in the U.S. News & World Report’s ranking of public affairs schools in the United States.
“The mission of our School, to improve the lives of people and their communities, here and abroad, has been my guiding principle and it has been truly inspiring to see you all embrace this sense of purpose as well,” Knott wrote. “I know that even as I start my new role on the east coast, I will miss the uniquely passionate staff, faculty and students at the Price School greatly.”
USC has said it will name an interim dean soon and will assemble an advisory committee as the search for the next Price school dean begins.

USC Student Health launched a survey Thursday to gauge well-being across the student body and compare experiences of different demographic populations.
In partnership with Student Affairs, the Undergraduate and Graduate student governments and other student organizations, the Student Well-being Index Survey aims to obtain a broad understanding of the factors affecting student wellness to determine ways the University can better support its students.
Student Health’s Health Promotion Strategy Team began designing the survey earlier this year, before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and considered canceling or postponing the survey when the University suspended normal operations. However, the planning committee opted to move forward with the initiative, adding questions about students’ preparedness and access to basic necessities to gauge how changes in academic and personal circumstances were affecting student well-being.
“We talked with some of our students that work as our community health organizers, talked with student government, other people, and the general sense was it was actually probably as important now to do this as it might have been in previous years,” Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said. 
The survey spans 12 pages and includes multiple choice questions about emergency preparedness, equity and mental health topics, in addition to a section collecting demographic information.
A sample of 30,000 students from both undergraduate and graduate programs will receive personal links to take the survey, with a greater proportion of students from smaller academic programs and demographics offered participation to ensure their perspectives will not be overlooked during statistical analysis of the survey data.
Because the number of students on campus decreased significantly as classes and activities moved online, the University will likely wait until the fall to make changes to areas of need identified in survey responses, Van Orman said.
“There’s groups in the University right now who are starting to plan already for what it looks like if and when classes resume,” Van Orman said. “I’m particularly interested in how we take what we learn on this and feed it to campus leadership, as far as what are students needing from almost a recovery standpoint after this disruption.”
The survey is one of several questionnaires, including the Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey, the Healthy Minds Study and the National College Health Assessment, administered by the University over the past two years to assess wellness and outreach efforts and student attitudes. 
Student Health will use the results of the Student Well-being Index Survey to make adjustments in its wellness offerings and ensure the University is meeting the needs of its socially and academically diverse demographic, both during typical circumstances and amid crises like the coronavirus pandemic.
“The health, safety, and well-being of our community is our most important priority, and our students are at the center of our concerns during this moment of crisis,” the email to survey recipients read. “By collectively sharing your state of mind, we can learn how this event is affecting us as individuals and as a university community, and plan for ways to improve future conditions.”

As the 2020 presidential race rolls along, the Dornsife Center for the Political Future has created “Election R&D: 2020 and Beyond,” a political podcast showcasing views from strategists, journalists and politicians aimed at informing students on the candidates, their platforms and the importance of voting. 
Hosted by CPF co-directors Robert Shrum and Michael Murphy, the political podcast typically derives from live events put together by the center, which are converted into a podcast that can be accessed online. However, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the podcast has shifted to hold events virtually.
“We’re creating the schedule as we go now,” Shrum said. “The truth is, if everything had remained normal, we would have turned each of the events that we’ve now had to cancel through the rest of the semester into a podcast. Now, we are beginning to work as hard as we can on finding ways to do this remotely.”
CPF’s most recent event, “Dornsife Dialogues: The Pandemic Election,” took place Thursday over Zoom, where the organization set up a virtual discussion about the impact of the coronavirus on the upcoming presidential election. Though the event will not be converted into a podcast until a later date, Shrum considered the event his favorite addition to “Election R&D.” Both he and Murphy hosted the event, but their roles in the podcast can vary depending on the context of each episode and whether they will be the sole speakers or a moderator among other guests. 
The two come from different political backgrounds: Shrum is a Democratic strategist who has served as an adviser to presidential candidates including Al Gore and John Kerry and Murphy has served as a political consultant for Republicans including current Utah Senator Mitt Romney and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
But their contrasting histories are beneficial to the podcast’s goals of facilitating civil and nonpartisan discourse, CPF Executive Director Kambiz Akhavan said. 
“Our center is devoted to bipartisan explorations of the biggest issues facing our country and our community and the podcast is a reflection of those conversations,” Akhavan said. “You can hear us in conversation and discussion with many of the top political strategists, elected officials, political journalists and practitioners to help us understand what’s going on in the world from a nonpartisan perspective and show that we can disagree with each other and still be civil.”
As part of the CPF team that put together regular panels and political events with former White House staff and campaign strategists, Shrum and Murphy looked to create an outlet that would allow audiences to listen in even when they cannot attend in person. 
“We do get a lot of interest from community members who will drive from miles away and regularly attend our events, which we love, but we’re always wanting to kind of cast a wide net and let more people know about these important discussions that we’re having,” said Erika Maldonado Singh, community engagement manager of CPF.
As one of the podcast producers, Maldonado said the series also allows students to find another outlet to become involved in political conversations. The strong appeal of the medium encouraged the team to use a podcast format for “Election R&D.” 
“Podcasts are all the rage right now — everyone has a podcast,” Maldonado said. “So we figured it was just another vehicle to share these important conversations that we’re having.”
A panelist in the Super Tuesday Watch Party, former assistant managing editor of the Los Angeles Times Christina Bellantoni said the podcast is an effective way to reach out to students who are now turning to podcasts to obtain information. 
“Students tend to listen to podcasts — I’ve been really surprised, actually,” Bellantoni said. “I listen to podcasts when I have the time in my car, and that’s not very frequently. Students tell me they listen to them all the time. They’re skateboarding around campus and they’re listening to them. They’re at the gym, they’re listening to them. So it’s a growing young audience.” 
CPF aired its first episode with Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci in early January. Since then, the podcast has quickly gained popularity, with nearly 900 downloads across their listening platforms, including Libsyn and TuneIn. 
As the audience continues to grow, both Maldonado and Akhvan said the podcast will continue to expand by including topics on climate change and the spread of misinformation through social media platforms, especially amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Despite the circumstances brought about by the coronavirus pandemic and the group having to move political dialogues remotely, Shrum hopes to see continued audience engagement with the podcast.
“Election R&D is our effort to continue to have a dialogue,” Shrum said. “Not just with students, but with a wider community about what’s going on in politics, even in this terrible time.”
