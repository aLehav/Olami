A possible shooting occurred Sunday at 1155 W. 24th St., though the incident appears to be an act of vandalism with a bb gun or a rock, said Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
The report of the shooting occurred at 7 p.m. by a USC graduate student who lived in the house. The graduate student, who was unidentified, was the only person to report the incident, which led DPS to believe that a large shooting did not occur.
“The person reporting the shooting said they heard a large crack,” Carlisle said. “They said that something pierced their window and thought it was a gunshot. No one else around the area heard it though.”
Though the Los Angeles Police Department monitors incidents that are reported to DPS, because the incident was contained, only DPS officers, along with the DPS watch commander, went to the scene, according to Carlisle.
Though the incident was minor, DPS issued a Trojans Alert to the University Park Campus student body at approximately 7:27 p.m. that urged students to remain away from the area. DPS officials sent an incident resolution email was sent out at 7:39 p.m. to students.
“We wanted to send out the [Trojans] Alert just in case it caused danger to any students,” Carlisle said. “But, luckily, the incident was quickly resolved and no one was injured.”
DPS will handle the investigation.
An act of vandalism in South Central?  How unsettling!!!

U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced on Thursday the lift of the long-standing ban on women serving in combat, a policy change that might expand future opportunities for women in USC’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corp program.
ROTC · Female members of USC’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, such as those pictured above at a training camp in October 2011, will be allowed to serve in combat now that the Pentagon has lifted its ban. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
Female cadets currently in USC’s ROTC program could possibly enter combat when the ban is fully lifted by the Pentagon’s January 2016 deadline.
Though hundreds of thousands of women have been deployed and women frequently find themselves in combat — more than 800 women have been wounded and 130 have died in Iraq and Afghanistan as of last year — overturning the 1994 Pentagon ban on women in combat roles will allow women to formally advance through the ranks.
“Women who are going through our ROTC program will be able to go into branches of the military that were historically closed to women, particularly infantry and armor,” said Robert Kirkland, commanding officer of USC Army ROTC and a professor of military science. “Women will also be able to go into those branches as officers.”
Though this development will have a significant effect on the equality of the U.S. armed forces as a whole, it will not have a major effect on the ROTC training program itself, according to U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen.
“The goal is to take away any barriers to service and grant women the same opportunities as men,” Christensen said. “So, it doesn’t really affect the ROTC program, it affects [the cadets’] futures.”
Kirkland said the training programs for men and women are already extremely similar — the only difference is men have higher physical-training expectations. The breadth and quality of on-campus learning and skill training in the field, however, is the same for all cadets.
“In ROTC, there is no difference between the training for men and women,” Kirkland said. “The things that we do to prepare them for service will not change due to this new policy.”
The policy is so new that it is difficult to foresee the impact it might have on ROTC recruitment. Kirkland, however, is confident that lifting the ban will promote enrollment in the program because of the newly opened opportunities for women.
Nationwide response to the news has been mixed. Many view Panetta’s decision as a landmark victory for military equality. Proponents hope that the some 250,000 jobs now opened to women will help pave the way for female advancement in leadership and access to benefits. Others are skeptical about certain practical implications. There are concerns about soldiers’ privacy and a possible increase in the number of female casualties.
“Lifting the ban on women in combat is definitely a step towards gender equality,” said Varun Dhaon, a freshman majoring in economics. “This change just needs to be implemented in a way that ensures safety for the women on the frontline from being targeted by outside and internal forces, in regard to both armed conflict and sexual harassment.”
Reactions to the news from ROTC students and officers of the ROTC program have been largely positive. Cadet Julianna La Luzerne, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, sees the change as a big step for women in the military.
“They’ve seen in the past years that women are capable of doing the things men can do,” La Luzerne said. “All women need is the opportunity to display their talents … [We shouldn’t] cut them off before they have the ability to show what they can do.”
Kirkland thinks the new policy will be accepted and celebrated by women in the ROTC program.
“The military has always been an agent of positive change in a number of areas,” Kirkland said. “Any time you can be more inclusive, it’s a good thing.”

After relatively smooth sailing during interim head coach Bob Cantu’s first three games, the Trojans’ ship capsized Saturday in Tucson. Following a heartbreaking overtime loss at Arizona State on Thursday, the Trojans tripped out of the gate and never regained their stride in a 74-50 defeat at No. 6 Arizona.
Wheels fall off · After shooting a blistering 15-28 from 3-point land on Thursday against Arizona State, USC went cold on Sunday, making only five shots on 20 3-point attempts in a lopsided loss at Arizona. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The 50 points is USC’s lowest scoring output of the year, and the Trojans fall to 8-13 (3-5 in Pac-12 play) on the season.
Senior point guard Jio Fontan led the Trojans with nine points in USC’s first game this season to have no players in double-digit scoring but also had four turnovers. USC’s starting five shot 7-of-37 (18.9 percent) from the field, and sophomore guard Byron Wesley and senior forward Renaldo Woolridge each scored eight points for the Trojans.
“[Fontan] just has to continue to be the quarterback, play with poise and be at the point where we need to move forward,” Cantu said on Fontan’s struggles in directing the offense.
In what is becoming a routine occurrence, the Trojan 7-footers failed to make an impact. Junior forward Dewayne Dedmon had three blocks, no points and four fouls in a mostly unimpressive performance. The same goes for junior center Omar Oraby, who contributed little besides four fouls, a turnover and a missed shot in 12 minutes.
The Trojans shot 28.1 percent from the floor, including just more than 22 percent in the first half, and a 10-0 USC run in the final two minutes and 22 seconds made the game seem more competitive than it really was.
“We weren’t making shots, we weren’t getting stops and we just got ourselves in a hole early and had a tough time getting out of it,” Cantu said.
The Trojans were out of it from the start, not scoring until their seventh possession and falling in a quick 6-0 hole. That deficit turned into 12-2, then 18-4 with 13:36 left in the half after back-to-back 3-pointers. For every USC basket, the Wildcats seemed to answer with three of their own.
Making just one field goal in the first seven minutes did not help the Trojans’ case, as putrid field goal shooting, a Wildcat lockdown on USC’s starting trio of guards and needless turnovers translated into a 29-7 deficit with eight minutes left in the opening half. After scoring 64 points against Arizona State on Thursday, the trio of Fontan, Wesley and junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell combined for just 20 points against the Wildcats.
“We came out really sluggish offensively, and Arizona came out very aggressively on defense and just took us out of our offense,” Cantu said. “Shots weren’t going down early, and they were for us in previous games.”
Junior forward Ari Stewart had an easy dunk and quick layup to finish the half, but the Trojans trailed 39-20 at the break.
A 19-point deficit was as close as the Trojans got. In the second half, it took the Trojans eight minutes to score their second field goal as Arizona took a 9-1 run to make it 52-25 with 13:03 left in the game. At this point, the Trojans were toast in Tucson.
“Basketball is a game of momentum, and we didn’t have momentum at any point of this game,” Cantu said.
The Wildcats were led throughout the second half by guard Nick Johnson, who led all scorers with 14 points and came up with easy baskets by taking advantage of USC’s struggles in transition and post defense.
USC struggled on defense to block off Arizona’s passing lanes, and the Wildcats’ speed and constant ball movement led to all too many open layups or dunks by Arizona big men making cuts or coming off screens.
The epitome of the Trojans’ struggles Sunday afternoon came with a little more than eight minutes left in the game, when Arizona’s Johnson stutter-stepped right by Wesley and two other USC defenders, then coasted on the baseline for a reverse slam that looked more a dunk contest entry than an in-game bucket.
Arizona took a 74-40 lead with 2:58 left, tied for USC’s largest deficit of the season. By then, the benchwarmers from both sides were in the game.
The Trojans finished strong on a 10-0 tear, including freshman forward Strahinja Gavrilovic’s first points of his college career, but the scoring burst was about 30 minutes too late.
Undoubtedly upset at this lopsided defeat, USC must regroup in a hurry, as their next game comes Wednesday at UCLA, who fell to Arizona State on Saturday, 78-60.
The Trojans lost all three meetings against the Bruins during the 2011-12 season.

In a weekend fraught with inclement weather, a last-minute change of venue and scheduling uncertainties, the USC men’s tennis team swept their way through the field at the ITA Kick-Off on Sunday at Marks Stadium, claiming the championship by defeating the Fresno State Bulldogs 4-0 on Sunday.
Though the final was played at Marks Stadium as planned, the opening leg of the tournament on Saturday was relocated 50 miles east to the Hampton Indoor Courts in Riverside, Calif. because of rain. USC coach Peter Smith admitted that the logistical uncertainties and the change of venues presented a challenge for the Trojans, who clinched their spot in the final by defeating San Diego State 4-0, on  Saturday in Riverside.
“Adversity is good … [we can] learn from adversity. Last year we played indoors twice [and] we had a three-hour rain delay,” Smith said. “We have to be able to handle all this [adversity] and have the patience to see yourself through.”
The Trojans would face some more unexpected adversity, as USC’s doubles teams secured their point with a bit of dramatic flourish. After splitting the first two matches, the doubles point came down to a tiebreak between No. 1 pairs freshman Max De Vroome and sophomore Roberto Quiroz of USC and Reid deLaubenfels and Nikolas Papic of Fresno State. De Vroome and Quiroz cruised in the tiebreak, however, to secure the point 8-7(3).
In singles play, Quiroz, junior Emilio Gomez and the rest of the Trojans demonstrated in their vanquishing of Fresno State why they entered the season as one of the top teams in the nation.
Junior Ray Sarmiento, who was injured in last week’s Sherwood Collegiate Cup victory, sat out the weekend because of an abdominal injury. Sarmiento stated that his injury was manageable, and he planned to be back by Friday for the team’s match against Texas. Also out was Yannick Hanfmann, who was forced to retire at Sherwood  because of injury.
In Sarmiento’s stead, Gomez (6-2, 6-3) played a tidy, fundamentally sound match in the No. 1 spot while looking every bit a top-ranked position player. The sharp angles on Gomez’s blistering forehands were ultimately too much for deLaubenfels, who fell victim to the Trojan’s superior athleticism and shot-making.
The No. 5 match saw the USC debut of the young De Vroome. The Netherlands native is listed at 6-foot-5 but is at least an inch-and-a-half taller than his listed height. In his singles debut against Fresno State junior Sam MacNeil, De Vroome explained that he “did not want to lay off the pressure and let [MacNeil] back into the match.” De Vroome’s length, in tandem with a startlingly refined service game, ensured that the freshman was never truly challenged en route to his defeat of MacNeil, 6-1, 6-1.
In his No. 2 match with sophomore Sai Nakireddi, Quiroz punctuated the court with thunderous groundstrokes that had his opponent on the defensive for the majority of the match. In the first set, it seemed that Quiroz would cruise to an easy victory. His terrifying onslaught of forehands eventually overwhelmed Kartik, and he took the set 6-1.
In the second set, however, Kartik would give chase and play patiently, attempting to neutralize forehands and take advantage of various unforced errors by Quiroz. At one point in the second set, Kartik was up 4-1 and Quiroz’s play resembled little of his first set.
“He must have forgot that we play two out of three sets,” Smith said. “Where [Quiroz] comes from, they only play one set. It wasn’t until he was down 4-1 in the second [set] when he says, ‘Oh yeah, we play two out of three.’”
With his alleged bout of amnesia subsided, Quiroz would recover form and reel off five straight games to secure the match 6-1, 6-4.
After the graduation of five-time All-American Steve Johnson and veteran Daniel Nguyen, Gomez and Sarmiento are charged with the task of leading a young team that fields no seniors in singles play. Gomez invited the challenge, saying that the team “has to step up,” and that he and Sarmiento “can take the responsibility to play the big positions and the big matches.”
That responsibility will be put to the test in short order, as Gomez will lead the charge again Tuesday as the Trojans play a doubleheader against Cal Poly Pomona and UC Irvine at Marks Stadium.

Okay, I’ll bite.
Up until now, I resolved never to write about the NCAA, knowing that USC fans have heard it all — at some point, handwringing and finger-pointing just grow tiresome. But in light of the most recent news regarding the NCAA’s flubbing of the Miami investigation, I believe it’s time to air grievances and explain why the institution is devoid of all credibility and moral authority.
Before introducing the NCAA’s latest embarrassment, let’s review USC’s main contention: The sanctions the football program received in 2010 are not commensurate with any precedent and far exceed recent punishments given out to schools for worse transgressions.
When Ohio State and North Carolina received their laughable sanctions before this past season, I gritted my teeth in absolute disbelief.
To boil it down, former Ohio State coach Jim Tressel knew his players were trading their uniforms and bowl game memorabilia for tattoos. Investigators found emails to attest to that. North Carolina decidedly trumped Ohio State, committing academic fraud by allowing six football players to compete while academically ineligible. On top of this affront to the student-athlete ideal, multiple Tar Heels also received impermissible agent benefits totaling in excess of $31,000.
Though USC didn’t give Reggie Bush any gifts or special treatment, the NCAA said in its ruling that the university lacked institutional control and should have expected agents, who drooled at the running back’s NFL potential, to try to make inroads with the former USC star. Ultimately, USC should have taken more steps to ensure Bush’s amateurism stayed intact, the NCAA argued — without question a fair point. No one can argue intelligently that USC didn’t deserve some type of punishment.
But here comes the kicker: If USC gets punished for not knowing something it probably should have known, what happens when university administrations willfully and brazenly violate NCAA rules? Using some warped sense of logic, the NCAA gave Ohio State and North Carolina half the postseason ban and roughly 30 percent of the scholarship reductions USC received.
Though I should have known better, I still held out hope in the form of Miami. Screwing up the Miami investigation would be too big of a feat, I figured. After all, convicted Ponzi schemer and Miami booster Nevin Shapiro fully admitted to throwing sex and drug yacht parties for Miami recruits and even funding an abortion for one of their girlfriends.
But fortunately for Miami, we learned for certain last Wednesday that the NCAA’s incompetence knows no bounds. NCAA President Mark Emmert announced in a statement that the NCAA Infractions Committee bungled its investigation by mishandling at least two depositions while working with an attorney for Shapiro. In essence, the NCAA worked with Shapiro’s bankruptcy attorney to ask witnesses in his bankruptcy case deposition questions pertaining to the Miami investigation, thus obtaining information — under oath — it could not otherwise get. Let’s just say that the chances this attorney keeps her license are pretty slim.
As a result, the long-anticipated notice of allegations against Miami will not be released until an external review of the investigation occurs within the next two weeks. Emmert confirmed that none of the evidence collected illegally will be used in the report and that some of the investigators are no longer working on the case — what a relief, right?
It’s becoming increasingly difficult to understand why high-power universities subject themselves to the whims of an incompetent institution drowning in inconsistencies. The NCAA currently faces six separate lawsuits stemming from its investigative practices.
The external review will be conducted by former Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein, who will also have the latitude to review the NCAA’s methods in previous cases. Such news should interest Trojan fans because Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Frederick Shaller, who currently presides over former USC assistant football coach Todd McNair’s lawsuit against the NCAA, has indicated his belief that NCAA investigators were “over the top” in the USC case.
But even if USC experiences the best-case scenario, with Wainstein recommending the lifting of its sanctions, there will be little vindication. By the time the review goes through the bureaucratic rigmarole, the only recourse available to the NCAA will be to remove the scholarship reductions scheduled for the 2014 season — the last part of the sanctions.
Of course, USC would welcome such a decision, but the damage has already mostly been done. The only serious retribution will come if the NCAA undergoes serious reform and decides to heed its mission of “commitment to fair play.”
But I would caution USC fans to tamp down expectations. We’ve bet on the NCAA to listen to common sense before.
I may have missed it.  What about the NCAA involvement in placing the most severe sanctions on PSU by inventing a new “culture issue” sanction.  The NCAA invoked severe sanctions on the PSU football program even though not one NCAA rule was broken.   In fact, the sanctions are based on alleged opinions that PSU administrators coverd up the pedophile Sundusky to protect PSU football.   This opinion has not been proved and it is an absurd theory – it basically makes no sense.   You completely missed the boat in your article by not reporting on the NCAA’s biggest debacle of all time.   The media needs to take responsiblity for reporting the facts and not just the sensational junk that in the case of PSU mushroomed into a false story.  Sundusky is a pedophile no doubt but the rest of the story is not being told by the press.
USC should have sued the NCAA years ago, if for no other reason than to stem the tide of negative press. Instead we hid in the corner and allowed unmitigated trashing of our University and a blanket ‘cheating’ argument for our FB success. The USC administration let down all USC alumni and supporters by forgetting what Fight On means. Sad.

Seven high school athletes have chosen to enroll at USC for the spring semester and will begin practicing with the football team when practice resumes in March.
Reinforcements · Members of USC coach Lane Kiffin’s highly touted recruiting class are already on campus after finishing high school early. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Headlining the list of new Trojan football prospects is top-ranked quarterback Max Browne of Skyline High School in Sammamish, Wash. Browne was named the 2012-13 Gatorade national football player of the year and set state records for career passing yards and completions. He’s expected to compete for the starting quarterback position as a freshman for the Trojans.
Joining Browne is a group of talented players on both sides of the ball, particularly in the secondary. Defensive back Su’a Cravens from Vista Murrieta High School (Calif.) was named the USA Today defensive national player of the year and is the top-ranked player at his position according to ESPN. Chris Hawkins (Rancho Cucamonga High School) and Leon McQuay III (Armwood High School in Florida.) are four-star recruits who are also poised to join a revamped secondary.
USC will get help in the backfield from running back Justin Davis (Lincoln High School in California), and also at wide receiver with the return of 2012 recruit Darreus Rogers. Rogers wasn’t cleared to participate with the team by the NCAA last season but is now eligible to play.
Rounding out the list is defensive lineman Kenny Bigelow from Eastern Christian Academy in Elkton, Md. He is the third-ranked defensive tackle in his class, according to ESPN.
The rest of USC’s 2013 recruiting class will be officially announced on Feb. 6. As it currently stands, the Trojans have seven additional verbal commitments. Those recruits have until signing day (Feb. 6) to officially make a decision on where to play next season. Despite facing scholarship restrictions, USC’s class is currently ranked ninth in the country according to ESPN.

The USC women’s basketball team played a pair of home games over the weekend, jumping out to double-digit leads early in both contests. However, the games would result in completely different outcomes.
Strong weekend · Junior forward Cassie Harberts averaged 25 points per game against Arizona State and Arizona over the weekend. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy blew a 16-point halftime lead to lose 60-53 to Arizona State on Friday but were able to hold on to a 21-point halftime lead to beat Arizona 74-57 on Sunday. The victory ended a three-game Pac-12 losing streak that began Jan. 17 in an overtime loss against Cal.
Junior forward Cassie Harberts led USC (8-11, 5-3 Pac-12) with 26 points, six rebounds and three blocks against Arizona(11-8, 3-5 Pac-12). Sophomore guard Kiki Alofaituli added 11 points while fellow sophomore guard Ariya Crook finished with 15 points, seven assists and five steals.
USC got in rhythm quickly against the Wildcats, jumping out to a 23-8 lead in the first 11 minutes behind Harberts’ 13 points. They would stretch their lead to as many as 23 and entered halftime up 43-22. Much of that had to do with USC’s accuracy from the field:  the Women of Troy shot 50 percent at the half compared to Arizona’s 23 percent. Harberts led all players with 15 points and six rebounds at the half, while Crook added nine points and four assists.
Davellyn Whyte and Kama Griffitts led all Arizona scorers with five points at the half. Whyte would finish with 13 points, while Griffitts finished with 10 points and nine rebounds.
The Wildcats came out of the locker room more aggressive on defense, but despite forcing more mistakes from the Women of Troy, Arizona was only able to cut the USC lead down to 48-35. USC would go on a 9-2 run to shift momentum back their way and hold on for the win. Their lead got to as many as 24 in the second half, and they would finish shooting 48 percent on the day to Arizona’s 29 percent.
On Friday, USC looked like it was ready to roll to an easy win over the Sun Devils (11-9, 3-5 Pac-12) after entering halftime with a 36-20 lead.
Unfortunately, the second half was dramatically different from the first.
Arizona State outscored the Women of Troy 40-17 in the second half, changing the outlook of the game.
The Women of Troy were led by Harberts, who finished with 24 points and 14 rebounds, including 19 points and 10 rebounds in the first half. Harberts was the only player to score in doublefigures. Sophomore forward Alexyz Vaioletama added seven points and six rebounds, while Alofaituli finished with six points, four rebounds and three assists.
The Sun Devils were led by Janae Fulcher and Promise Amukamara, who each scored 9 points.
USC controlled the boards in the first half against Arizona State, outrebounding the Sun Devils 24-12, and shot 41 percent compared to Arizona State’s 32 percent. The Sun Devils came out more aggressive in the second half, outrebounding the Women of Troy 16-15 and shooting 59 percent from the floor compared to USC’s 24 percent.
The Sun Devils took a 54-53 lead with less than one-and-a-half minutes to go in the game off two free throws by Haley Videckis and didn’t give it up.
The Women of Troy stay at the Galen Center to play another pair of home games next weekend, taking on the Utah Utes (10-9, 1-7 Pac-12) on Friday at 7 p.m. and the No. 20 Colorado Buffaloes   (15-3, 4-3 Pac-12) on Sunday at 10 a.m.

When students at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism check out equipment from Jim Yoder, the audio-visual technologies manager, they might be greeted by a card trick. After all, Yoder has been practicing magic since he was 8 years old.
Most people  find their passions when they are young, and Yoder was no exception. He became interested in magic after he started to watch a TV show called The Magic Land of Allakazam.
“Everybody that is anybody in magic at my age grew up watching this show,” Yoder said. “I watched it every Saturday morning until it went off the air.”
Yoder pursued his childhood dream of becoming a magician by becoming a member of the Academy of Magical Arts, an exclusive magicians-only club that boasts more than 5,000 members, for 14 years. Members include Mark Wilson, the star from Yoder’s favorite TV show, as well as celebrities including David Copperfield and Neil Patrick Harris. The Academy meets at their clubhouse, the Magic Castle, in Hollywood, Calif.
Yoder began developing his skill in magic through the help of multiple mentors that he has had since he started practicing magic.
“The tricks that I [do] represent several years of my life,” Yoder said.
Yoder was even able to meet and befriend his longtime idol, Wilson, through the Academy 15 years ago.
“It really and truly was so neat,” Yoder said. “I can’t even describe how it is to meet some icon that you’ve always looked up to.”
Magicians categorize illusions into close-up, parlor magic and stage magic. Yoder’s favorite type is stage magic, especially large illusion tricks such as sawing a woman in half or tricks involving animals.
“Producing doves from anywhere has always been a fascinating thing to me,” Yoder said. “[It’s] the most fascinating magic in the world because from nothing you produce something that is more than just there — it’s living and flying.”
Though Yoder does have the title of a magician, he does not perform professionally. Other than occasionally performing tricks for his students, he prefers to work behind the scenes, as a wizard behind the curtain.
“My true magical expertise is in ‘staging’ magic,” Yoder said. “I design lighting, soundscapes and staging for magicians. The staging of a magic show is often as important as the performance of the illusions.”
Yoder says he helps the performing magician misdirect the audience by controlling the scenic, lighting and audio elements in the show. He is also responsible for helping with the Academy’s annual awards show.
To Yoder, the most rewarding aspect of performing is when the audience asks how a trick was done.
“It’s music to my ears,” Yoder said. “If I can fool you, then I’ve successfully done the trick.”
Chelsea Johnson, a senior majoring in critical studies, says she is intrigued by watching Yoder in action.
“It was just fun just to watch him because he has so much joy [performing the trick],” Johnson said. “My reactions to his tricks are just complete awe. I just have no idea how he did it and he’s very smooth with it.”
To Yoder, learning how to practice magic has not made it any less magical — if anything, it has enhanced his life even more.
“To me, life is fascinating  —  life just in general is magic,” Yoder said. “What magic does is that it allows me to impart some of that onto whoever wishes to see it.”

Undergraduate Student Government extended its application deadline to Tuesday at 5 p.m. for Greek senatorial candidates because of this year’s small applicant pool.
Of the twelve senator positions, three are reserved for Greek senators. There were 10 candidates for Greek senator in 2012 and 12 in 2011.
This is not the first year there have been too few senatorial candidates during the election cycle. Kelly Hann, USG’s director of communications, said she is not surprised because it is a common trend.
“It’s kind of cyclical,” Hann said. “If you look at the trends over the last six years, this tends to happen. There’s a lot of applicants one year and then the next year some people get discouraged.”
Hann said there were many applicants for the commuter and residential senators.
USG President Mikey Geragos said having more students running will create stronger competition among Greek senator candidates and will garner a better outcome for the election.
“We made the decision to extend the deadline because we wanted it to be more competitive,” Geragos said.
Geragos believes outreach is key to garnering a larger applicant pool.
“We’re thinking about doing a better job at marketing specifically for Greeks. We did a really good job overall getting other constituents,” Geragos said.
Greek senators serve as representatives for the entire USC Greek community. Geragos, who served as a Greek senator his sophomore year, said it was a great way for him to get involved with the university.
“I loved the experience,” Geragos said. “It’s such a good opportunity to connect with different types of students and to voice their opinions.”
USG’s Co-Director of Elections and Recruitment Violetta Abi Naked believes the Greek senators help bridge the gap between the administration and students involved in Greek life.
“Through this official position, the senator can really get his or her voice heard,” Abi Naked said. “This power on the Senate can make a big impact on Greek life.”
USG hopes to release the names of all presidential and senatorial candidates late this week after the Office of Student Affairs and the Registrar’s office review the candidates.

With school back in the swing of things, there is one question that floats through the minds of most students: What show should I procrastinate with today?
For those who are looking for a light, fun half-hour comedy, The Mindy Project is must-see television.
Mindy Kaling, the mastermind behind The Mindy Project, has become a household name in the world of comedy television and in the The Mindy Project, she certainly continues her reign as comedy queen. Some would even say that the show is better than The Office. If a girl is looking for suspense, Pretty Little Liars is often a popular choice. After their fearless pack leader Alison DiLaurentis (Sasha Pieterse) is murdered, four girls are haunted by people that watch their every move, threaten them and put them in physical danger. It’s a guaranteed obsession — ABC Family style.
TV has more to offer than an over-dramatized, though beloved, show about girls being stalked by an unrealistically connected teenage psychopath, however.
Unfortunately, these shows are often underrated, especially among college students. Still, why not watch something of a little more substance?
One show in particular that is about to blow up in everybody’s faces is Suits.
But it is not very often that one hears a friend say, “Hey! Did you watch the new Suits last night?”
Theories range as to why Suits is not as big as it should be. Perhaps it could be because it truly just has a lousy name. Suits seems like all business and no fun. However, fans of the show know it is just the opposite.
Yes, there are lawyers and plenty of suits, but there are also affairs, schemes, good-looking male leads, good-looking female leads, fast cars and lots of drama and tension. Boring? No. Exciting and well worth the time it takes to catch up on season one? Yes.
Suits is one of the only shows that manages to feel like there is never a dull moment. The show continuously surprise audiences through the dramatic tension between the characters (who knew so much went down in a law office?). Essentially, if you’re a fan of drama and haven’t checked it out yet, you should watch it. As if one needs any more motivation to watch the show, its beautiful star, Patrick J. Adams, went to USC.
If you’re looking for something more rooted in comedy (not that Suits isn’t funny — in fact, the constant banter back and forth between characters leaves many in stitches), Go On starring Friends’ Matthew Perry is one of the best new half-hour comedies of the spring.
In the show, the main character, talk show star Ryan King (Matthew Perry), joins a “life change” group after the love of his life dies in a car accident.
The characters are crazy, loveable and absolutely hilarious. The life change group consists of Mr. K, a creepy bearded man who is not afraid to touch people; Fausta, a woman who refuses to understand that Anne’s wife who passed was Anne’s wife, not husband (as Ryan says in one episode: “I feel like she is choosing to not understand”); and Sonya, the chipper cat lady who is in the group solely because her cat died (of course, later she ends up adopting enough cats to fill her house).
Go On begins with the sad premise of a cynical man with a cool job and turns it into a world of pointed jokes and amusing one-liners. It’s Perry’s best show since Friends.
For those who haven’t started watching, here’s some good news: The show is only in its first season, so there won’t be too much of a backlog to catch up on. It truly is the perfect show to watch during a quick break between classes.
A new show that has had a harder time finding its rhythm is the highly anticipated Sex and the City spin-off, The Carrie Diaries. AnnaSophia Robb had big Jimmy Choos to fill when she stepped into the role of a younger Carrie Bradshaw. So far, Robb has failed in making the character her own. It seems that Sarah Jessica Parker, the original actress who played Bradshaw, is the only one who can nail that part down.
In the first episode, in one of the many cliched journal entries, Robb says, “I’m in the city and I belong.” Excuse me? Many loyal fans of the original show most likely were thinking that Robb and her voice-overs belonged off the screen, far away from the iconic Bradshaw character.
Granted, it’s not the worst thing created, but something as iconic as Sex and the City cannot be redone, especially with cheesy acting and weak character development.
One day, when Parker’s twins grow up, maybe they can fill the huge shoes of their famous mother. At this point, it seems more likely that they will step up to the plate than Robb. Tabitha and Marion, the future of Carrie Bradshaw is in your hands — your tiny, adorable baby hands.
Though The Carrie Diaries does not exactly cut it for now, the good TV options are absolutely endless. Pretty Little Liars is a valid obsession to have, if one does not mind sounding ridiculous talking about the show and how “A” does this or that. And The Mindy Project and Go On are fantastic ways to spend a quick 24 minutes between classes. Lighten the mood, laugh a little and then go back to that calculus homework.
Yet true TV comes in the form of Suits. Watch some lawyerly jargon go down, fall in love with the characters and follow the intense firm drama. Disappointment almost never comes in the form of classy suits and fake Harvard Law degrees.

Los Angeles Theater Works’ production of Pride and Prejudice is a journey into another era in more ways than one.
Jane Austen’s beloved novel was published exactly 200 years ago Monday, and though any telling of this story is a reflection of that time,  LATW’s incarnation of Pride and Prejudice also harkens back to the days before television, when radio was king. Cleverly, the play combines elements of a radio play and a traditional stage play — approriate, considering Pride and Prejudice was recorded and broadcast over the radio.
A classic revisited· Pride and Prejudice at Los Angeles Theater Works’ does not stray far from Jane Austen’s original language and text. – Couresty of Matt Petit
To do that, there are several standing microphones placed around the stage atop a series of raised platforms. There are no sets; instead, images of each setting are projected on a curtain. In the corner sits a table on which several props and a microphone for recording sound effects are placed.
All of the actors, though, appear in period costumes that reflect their characters and interpersonal relationships. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, for example, are the only characters dressed in green, as if a matching set from the very beginning. To contrast this design, Mr. Wickham stands in red, underscoring how his character is in almost every way the opposite of  Mr. Darcy.
There is a clothes rack downstage and the actors do sometimes change or add to their wardrobe based on which character they are currently playing. Like a radio play, some of the actors play multiple roles and change their voices and countenances for each role. The only actors who play only one role are the leads, USC alumnus Julia McIlvaine (Elizabeth) and Nick Toren (Mr. Darcy). Even the narrator and foley artist play two other roles.
The multiple characters that are portrayed by the same actors tend to comment upon or contrast one another. For instance, Chloe Dworkin plays both Jane Bennet and Charlotte Lucas, two characters extremely close to Lizzy but very different in temperament and looks. Though Jane Bennet is the woman Mr. Collins desires to marry the most, Charlotte Lucas is the one who eventually becomes his wife.
The characters played by Darren Richardson (Mr. Bingley, Mr. Collins and Mr. Wickham) furthermore, are all strangers and potential suitors for the Bennet girls, but each embodies extremely different qualities of manhood and with varying degrees of worthiness.
Jane Carr also plays two, near-opposite characters — Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine — whom represent the silly and the pretentious, respectively. Each of these character changes showcases not only the entire cast’s acting talent, but also its versatility.
The acting in the play is uniformly first-rate, funny and charming. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (Nicholas Hormann and Carr) are especially hilarious and well-suited to their parts. They both have brilliant comedic timing, particularly Carr.
The adaptation stays very true to the original novel, lifting direct passages of both narration and dialogue, but is compressed to be only about two hours long. But interestingly, the narrator isn’t the only one who speaks the narration. When the narration includes characters’ thoughts, those characters speak those thoughts in the third person, just as they are written in the novel.
The fact that the actors have to speak into one of the many microphones on stage restricts the possibilities for blocking in the piece, and means that they have to get creative in the movements that are possible.
For example, when Mr. Darcy and Lizzy are dancing, very little dancing is actually happening on stage because they are also talking. On the other hand, when Mr. Darcy confesses his love for Lizzy, because of his excitement and eagerness, he gradually jumps from the furthest microphone from Lizzy to the closest. As the tension increases, the distance between their microphones decreases.
The microphone situation has other curious side effects, such as the fact that sometimes the actors are looking not at each other, but rather unnaturally out into the audience. These things add to the disconnection from realism that the style of the play created.
They also, however, add to the awkward comedic tension inherent in Austin’s original piece, which is the area in which this adaptation seems to excel the most. Throughout most of the play, the comedy is the main focus, with the drama largely taking a secondary role. This seems to be a good call: In one performance, the audience was extremely reactive to this, constantly laughing, applauding, ooh-ing, and aah-ing.
It is important to note that despite the occasional forced distance between characters, all the kisses actually do happen. And to add visual depth to some of the scenes, there are characters on stage who do not speak, but congregate upstage as if heavy in conversation. Not everything is microphone-centric.
Ultimately, as long as the casting is solid, it’s extremely difficult to screw up Pride and Prejudice, because the source material is still enormously funny, engaging and endearing, even after 200 years.
 
The second leg of the national tour of LATW’s Pride and Prejudice kicked off in Cerritos, Calif. on Jan. 25 and continues through Feb. 28.

While sitting through — and actively trying not to walk out of Movie 43 — you might begin to simply ask yourself: How? As in, how such a large, respected and successful cast was convinced to participate?
Painful comedy · Halle Berry looks on as co-star Stephen Merchant gets a new tattoo. Scenes as eccentric as this one are all too common throughout Movie 43, which thrives on crass, tasteless humor. – Courtesy of Relativity Media
In Movie 43, Kate Winslet, Emma Stone, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry and dozens of other established Hollywood stars are cast in a series of sketches only connected by their manic obscenity. Unfortunately, most of the gags are so focused on being offensive that they forget to be funny, and the few ones with a clever premise are stretched out so long that their charm is completely lost.
The movie segues from Hugh Jackman with testicles hanging from his neck giving a baby a kiss to Parks and Recreation’s Chris Pratt taking a laxative and subsequently getting hit by a car. By the time a cartoon cat urinates endlessly on Elizabeth Banks to close out the movie, you will probably be sore from the extensive cringing and eye shielding the movie demands from its viewers. The only laughs come out of sheer nervousness, achieving the comedy heights of an overtly racist, slightly drunk relative at a family gathering. “Nothing is off limits” is a phrase tossed around lightly when describing comedy, but after the release of this movie, it should probably be retired for fear of being misleading. The movie “jokes” at the expense of incest, every single kind of substance the human body can excrete and the ever-hilarious Holocaust. It plays like a demented episode of Saturday Night Live in which a cracked-out homeless man has replaced Lorne Michaels. Perhaps its only saving grace is that the movie, realizing its own insanity, actually cast Dennis Quaid in the role of a cracked-out homeless man inventing the stories.
The “fill-in-the-blank Movie” series, including the likes of Date Movie, Disaster Movie and Epic Movie, took as many references as they could from a certain genre of movies and pop culture, mixed in poop jokes and unleashed them on unsuspecting audiences. Movie 43 does essentially the same thing, substituting a parade of Hollywood stars for the random references.
This, again, begs the question: How were these actors, responsible for such acclaimed movies as Pulp Fiction, Titanic and The Help, convinced to do this? It is well known that many actors known for doing more dramatic fare love doing comedy. John Hamm stars as the serious and pensive Don Draper in Mad Men yet plays fantastic roles in 30 Rock and Bridesmaids. And who can forget Tom Cruise’s surprising and hilarious role as an overweight studio chief in Tropic Thunder?  But the comic roles these actors took on in Movie 43 are not cut from the same cloth. The acting is actually fine, as the actors seem to take a certain macabre joy from acting out such ridiculous scenarios while marring their filmographies for posterity. This alone separates the movie from the  afformentioned “fill-in-the-bank” dreck (those films generally lack any acting talent), but at the same time might make it even harder to watch. Few things are more depressing than wasted talent, and never has more talent been wasted in a single 90-minute period.
The best comedy finds the limits of what is acceptable and pushes them further. Monty Python and South Park didn’t become transformative hits by being conservative. A show would not have gotten away with calling a major music star a gay fish 30 years ago, but when South Park did, it was hilarious. Pushing the limits is one of the hallmarks of great comedy, as it makes us question the the limitations while simultaneously allowing us to laugh about them.
Movie 43 doesn’t even notice the limits as it runs past them naked, laughing maniacally and yelling obscenities at the top of its voice. Blaming its 17 writers and 12 directors seems very easy, as they are the creators of this obscene Frankenstein’s monster of a story. But it is the actors who, by agreeing en masse to participate in this thing, gave it the legitimacy  needed to be widely released and publicized. Without them, it would have just been lost in the shuffle of terrible, straight-to-DVD gross-out comedies. Whatever misplaced set of ideas about the nature of comedy that convinced them all to take part must have been a sight to behold.

In 2008, The New York Times reported the story of Hiu Lui Ng, a 34-year-old New Yorker who died while in custody of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Though the Times’ coverage of Ng’s death was largely an investigation into the conditions and medical care allotted to detained individuals, the question of why Ng was detained in the first place came into the spotlight as well.

Few issues in the United States garner the sort of controversy that the topic of immigration does, especially when referring to the question of what to do with the estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants presently living here. And with President Barack Obama headed to Las Vegas on Tuesday to relaunch his drive to overhaul immigration policy, it’ll be an issue that continues to divide Americans.
Many argue that instead of providing a pardon to these people, known as offering amnesty, for their unlawful entry to the country, the correct thing to do is to enforce stricter immigration policy and crack down on businesses that hire undocumented workers. In theory, these policies would discourage undocumented immigrants from being in the United States.
But while such a plan makes sense on paper, it overlooks one critical aspect of the immigration debacle: that many of the undocumented aliens living in the United States are Americans in all aspects but their legal status and recognize no place other than the United States as their  true home.
Ng is an example: He was an undocumented immigrant who overstayed the initial visa issued to him in 1992 when visiting the United States from Hong Kong. In that time, Ng built a life — as do so many other Americans. He went to college and studied computer engineering, a degree that later found him employment at the Empire State Building in Manhattan. Ng also married a U.S. citizen and had two American-born children, whom he helped raise in a house located in suburban Queens.
Ng’s story is repeated everyday all across the country. Millions of individuals live their lives as Americans: paying American taxes, eating American food, digesting American culture. They send their American children to attend American schools where they learn about American history.
Indeed, according to a Pew research study released in 2011, most undocumented immigrants living in the United States have been doing so for more than 10 years. The stereotype of undocumented immigrants living in the United States as being mostly fresh arrivals who are unacquainted with American culture is false, and those who call to return all undocumented immigrants to their native country would be supporting a grave injustice.
Too many Americans view immigration as an “us and them” issue. This has been true throughout American history, where eventual integration follows an initially xenophobic backlash. Cultural socialization takes time and generations — something many people fail to realize.
Immigrants, legal and not, provide a great service to the American country. In addition to fueling cultural diversification, immigrants are so resolute on providing a better environment for their children and families that they that they often work as society’s underclass, working jobs unpopular with many Americans.
In his inauguration speech last week, Obama said “our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.”
Obama has the right idea. But more Americans need to recognize that immigrants are not forces of evil in American society. Instead, immigrants need to be recognized for what they are: people, who have just as much right to a good life as you and I.

A “softer” stance would only encourage more people to break the rules.
Ng should have gone home when his visa expired, and applied to return.
Instead, he overstayed, and became deportable.
The fact that he died in custody is tragic, but it is his the result of his choice to violate the law.
We are already on the way to becoming Greece.  We cannot expect to grow the economy and save the country by allowing millions to self-determine their immigration rights.   Immigration policy exists to benefit the nation, not the individual who seeks entry.
Agreed. Not to mention the lowering standards from accepting these millions of people. We have a GDP in America. Other countries have their own that, in many cases, is far less. When these people enter, they don’t bring anything of value other than perhaps their work ethic. If they’re expected to pay taxes now, how much will they pay? Given that around half the country pays no income tax anyway, my guess is essentially none. Meanwhile, our standards get lowered because the wealth distribution curve shifts.
If the federal government thinks that 11 million new taxpayers is the goal to increase revenue, they’d better think again. Not to mention the new competition for unskilled jobs and the increased costs from having to pay them minimum wage, costs which get passed onto the consumers.
And what about all those applying for visas the legal way? They have to wait far longer and usually bring far more to the table.
The author of the article makes a case that the criteria to become an American Citizen is to not get caught coming into the country illegally for a number of years until you become very used to it. Does this principle apply to any other law? Can I rape and murder and as long as I do not get caught and otherwise build a quiet life, then me breaking the law is OK? I usually find people who support illegal immigration to fall into one of two camps. They either have family or they themselves have broken immigration laws and are wanting others to be able to break those laws with impunity. OR they are liberal, lily white people who make sure they live far away in clean white neighborhoods so it does not matter or affect them directly but they claim to be in favor of illegal immigration because they are so good people. Well why don’t we just open the flood gates and turn California into the paradise known as Mexico? There is a reason Mexicans are risking their lives to flee their country – they find it unlivable. Do we really want to turn LA into that 3rd world? We are getting closer and closer everyday
WE HAVE BEEN BETRAYED.
My guess the politicians will win this time and the American people—as always—will get the bill for supporting illegal aliens. Very few of us who haven’t been brain-washed over the illegal alien controversy and with a Socialist administration in power, the only winners are the “Freeloaders” deadbeats and spongers, which are bottom feeders that live of the rest of the working population. They pay for nothing, as everything virtually free especially with this Imperial regime. This is going to be a repeat performance of the 1986 path to citizenship that exploded into a fraudulent façade. The so called pay a fine, learn English as two required principles, never happened? Most fines were waived, as the majority of Guest Workers couldn’t afford it, and the so called learning the language was a travesty, as the illegal aliens involved took a couple of classes and because it was run by La Raza, got a pass score. The whole thing was a travesty and the commitment of former President Reagan’s Washington to prosecute employers fizzled. Let’s face it their all a bunch of bare faced liars who cringe at the feet of special interest groups, because they are the ones that really run the country. Obama promised transparency in D.C, but the whole place and both parties are awash with corruption, kick backs, and nepotism. It’s a father, son and daughter rot, that retirement means joining the ranks of high paid lobbyists on K street, the height of hypocrisy and legal thievery of your tax dollars in our central government, A few must be excused from these slimy-palmed politicians, such as Senator Sessions of Arkansas who is a people’s legislator and doesn’t work in collusion with anti-constitution politicians. Alas now, because of the loss of the election politicians as Sen. John McCain R-AZ has turned traitor and is complicit in a new path to citizenship. Is Mark Rubio also joining this sad circus of liars and deceit to the people?
FOR THE LIFE OF ME, WHY WOULD THESE ELECTED CIVIL SERVANTS, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT WANT TO ENACT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR A DELIBERATELY UNDERESTIMATED 11 MILLION PEOPLE SQUATTING HERE ILLEGALLY? WHEN THERE ARE OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS UNEMPLOYED, UNDEREMPLOYED OR JUST GIVEN UP AND JOINING THE RANKS (INCLUDING FOREIGN NATIONALS) SIGNING UP FOR FOOD STAMPS AND OTHER BENEFITS.
THIS TUESDAY WILL BE A GRAVE DAY FOR AMERICA, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD NO RESPECT FOR OUR LAWS GAINING CITIZENSHIP? FAR WORSE IS THE CONTINUENCE OF MORE CHAIN MIGRATION. The Nuclear Family Priority Act, HR 692 (Gingrey, R-GA), would end chain migration while expediting the reunification of married couples and of parents with their young children. It would eliminate the categories of adult siblings and adult children, providing an annual decrease in immigration of over 110,000 per year. The reduction would be larger over time as there would be fewer new immigrants to sponsor additional relatives (Chain Migration.) Then include this with the waiting BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP BILL. Look it up, as it makes good judgment, as other industrialized nations have also removed it. That only people who is already a U.S. citizen can apply for citizenship for their child. It’s become a travesty of 14th amendment that allowed slaves the right to citizenship and their descendants. This should was not applicable to illegal alien children, because at that time there was no such thing as illegal immigration. The cost in BILLIONS of dollars is too high, to carry on this fallacy?
ONCE THIS NEW PATH TO CITIZENSHIP IS READY TO BE SIGNED, MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS FOREIGN NATIONALS WILL SCRAPE THEIR MONEY TOGETHER IN A DESPERATE BID TO REACH OUR SHORES OR BORDERS BEFORE THE DEADLINE.
.EVENTUALLY—ILLEGAL ALIENS WILL BE STEALTHILY ALLOWED TO JOIN OBAMACARE, I’LL TAKE A BET ON THAT.
Hardly any of them have the guts to dare challenge putrid Senators like senile Harry Reid. Strangely enough I no longer own a firearm, but my thoughts only criminals will own guns that we need to protect our families. I hope shortly that California Liberal Senator Diane Feinstein gets mugged; she is a victim of a home invasion robbery or even worse. Something ominous happens to a lawmaker, they would quickly change their minds?  Most of these impersonators of honest people don’t live in the real world anyway. I get a continuous dialog from my cousin in Los Angeles of drunken hit and runs of by foreign drunk drivers, robberies, children attacked and molested. Want more information, and then go to THE DARK SIDE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION site. Never thought for one minute the American people were stupid enough to vote for anybody who had a greasy Liberal agenda? If these people’s representatives ever though that the American people came first, then they would have insured illegal entry into the United States was a FELONY. The blame goes back many years, when there were positive laws as the quota system, according to your country of birth. Now America is overrun from most illiterate, poorly educated foreigners from South of our borders. Then we have unknown number of illegal overstays that make up the number of 46 percent who arrive here by plane and not tracked, so they can be deported. I have pushed over and over again The LEGAL WORKFORCE BILL that makes sense, but then with the mostly withered old men in Washington, they are not listening as their golf score is more important, or the financial favors they get from corporation bosses. MAKE THEM LISTEN AND JAM WASHINGTON SWITCHBOARDS TOMORROW.
Every LIBERAL, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENT, TEA PARTY MEMBERS and a list of other parties that the high echelon whose abode  is the Capitol know that America is not just in a physical mess, but a nation almost irreparable more divided. Why is this man in Washington determined to split up our society, when he should be bringing us together, collectively? Our Constitution has been badly decomposed by President Obama, our liberties, freedoms and the American dream trodden down by anarchist, communist, Marxist; many of them have visited the White House? Check out these facts out at TEAPARTY.OR. Become more acquainted with the ugly facts and learn the REAL truth at American Patrol, Judicial Watch, NumbersUSA web sites.
We must be constantly be on our guard as many laws are past during late nights sessions, so that the public are only aware the day after. Monday, is going to be a very important day as President Obama is heading to Nevada to broadcast the need for a Path to Citizenship or the possibility of blanket Amnesty. But remember that Nevada has today the highest concentrations of illegal aliens, other than California on the West coast. Monday, if you haven’t already seen the writing on the wall, then speak up—call your politicians and tell the aide, you want to declare illegal aliens have no right to citizenship. THEY BROKE OUR LAWS, while honest people came through the correct channels. you may phone the United States Capitol switchboard at (202) 224-3121. A switchboard operator will connect you directly with the Senate office you request. One or two people will be ignored, but greater numbers will make a difference and could decide on the fate of America? After all the Heritage Foundation already stated that another Path to Citizenship would produce a taxpayer price tag of over 2 TRILLION DOLLARS, you have to wonder what these politicians are smoking. That’s already on Obama’s $4 to 5 TRILLION dollars amassing on the multi TRILLION dollar deficits. 
 Each year 400,000 babies are smuggled into America to claim citizenship. The price for the child/children (DREAMER CHILDREN) is a cornucopia of free entitlement stuff as a new citizen. Even before arriving here they have been well apprised of the welfare programs and how to scam them. Actual birthing factories have been set up, where pregnant women are departing planes from Asian countries to claim citizenship for their infant. Possessing a U.S birth certificate the child can return in adolescence and claim citizenship rights and then sponsor family members. CHAIN MIGRATION is a very expensive proposition for U.S. taxpayers, as later the immediate family is left without financial resources and then relies on Supplementary Social Security and public assistance.

On an evening just before Christmas in New Delhi, six men dumped a naked, bleeding 23-year-old woman off a bus after brutally gang-raping her. The severity of her injuries and the delay in medical treatment just after the incident led to her death two weeks later.
Jyoti Singh’s death prompted massive protests in New Delhi and across India. Young women joined together with teachers, parents and activists from all demographic groups to protest abuse against women and the Indian government’s failure to acknowledge the social issue. The cries for social justice in India include demands for new legislation and the enforcement of existing legislation that entails a greater punishment for violence against women.
After the incident, dozens of American journalists documented the alleged rape culture in India because of its mistreatment of women. But many articles written about the incident not only distorted the issue of social awareness in India, but also represented Western hypocrisy with regard to how issues of institutionalized sexual abuse are covered.
On Jan. 2, President Barack Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.,  proposed an amendment to the NDAA repealing the decades-long ban against health insurance coverage of abortions for service members who are survivors of rape.
Though many women’s rights advocates and women in the military applaud the bill as a small step forward for female service members, others have raised questions and concerns regarding the logistics of the bill. Many military women hold doubts that the bill would provide a solution to the broken system, citing the difficulties that accompany reporting sexual crimes in the military, especially when the accused is in a position of authority over the victim.
The new process has also raised fears that investigations into reported rapes and sexual assaults could, in fact, delay women from having the procedure as quickly as they could if they paid out-of-pocket. There are no provisions in the bill protecting women from commanders further mistreating the women after reporting a sexual assault.
In December 2012, the Department of Defense reported that one in every three women serving in the U.S. military is sexually assaulted. Meanwhile, the Pentagon’s most recent annual report on sexual assault prevention reports that only 3,192 sexual assaults were reported out of an estimated 19,000 that occurred; if the numbers are accurate, only 17 percent of rapes were reported. Women who did report sexual assaults were often met with disinterest by the military, and charges were hardly pursued. But what was most surprising was that the media coverage on the release of these shocking statistics was minimal — close to nothing.
Though the passage of NDAA serves as a step toward justice for the women serving in the military, there are still large changes that need to be made to ensure just and proper treatment of women. The statistics and disconcerting stories of rape victims in the military, along with the lack of legislation that protects them, perhaps reflects the patriarchic culture prevalent in our country. Moreover, the condescending attitude toward women, particularly from authority figures within the military, is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed before any bill or law can protect women against sexual abuse.
What is more disturbing is the lack of press attention on the issues of sexual assault in the United States. There was little coverage of the passage of Shaheen’s provision or its implications for women serving our country. American journalists discuss the fundamental issues that arise from patriarchal attitudes in far off countries but fail to address the same issues in our own. Maybe if they did, there would be more mass protests in the streets of Washington calling for social justice and a change in the military’s treatment of women.
The acknowledgement of the institutional mistreatment of women in the United States is the first step in making the necessary social changes that need to be made. Before we criticize other countries for their presumed social antiquities, we must examine the one we live in.
