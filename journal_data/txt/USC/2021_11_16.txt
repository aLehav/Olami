When she was growing up in Los Angeles, Paris Wise, a senior majoring in journalism, said she was never able to find a “close-knit” Native American community. That changed when she joined the Native American Student Assembly after arriving at USC. NASA was one of the many student assemblies, including the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the Asian Pacific American Student Services, that received a newly decorated space as students returned to campus for Fall 2021.
The USC Student Equity and Inclusion Programs launched the renovations following a “big push” from students, Wise, NASA’s director of public relations, said.
On Aug. 4, 2020 President Carol Folt wrote in a communitywide email about the University’s initiatives “to confront systemic racism at USC” and the expansion of “programming and space” for marginalized communities on campus.
Physical spaces for the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, Asian Pacific American Student Services, LGBTQ+ Resource Center and the First Gen+ Success Center, were remodeled at the beginning of summer 2021. The remodeled centers included improvements in furnishing and flooring along with expansions in space and relocations.
The push for remodeling and additional student resources stemmed from persistent student advocacy. Center Supervisor for CBCSA Damarea Parker said social movements, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, were a main driver for the cosmetic changes within cultural centers.
“There were a lot of things going on in the world,” Parker said. “There was the Black Lives Matter movement and other movements that were happening, and then also the students as well [were] advocating for more space to be able to engage and connect.”
CBCSA, once located on the fourth floor of the Student Union, has now replaced the former Ticket Office on the building’s first floor. Parker said the remodeled space is important to the overall well-being of students involved with the center. 
“We consider ourselves to be the hub for the Black community … and other folks who identify or allies who identify too, and it’s super important because this is where students come and can unapologetically be them,” Parker said. “They also get a chance to learn, grow, experience, do a number of events, programs — all the things that enrich their student experience.”
The additional space in the new CBCSA lounge allows the center to host a number of events — such as panels, discussions and mix-and-mingle gatherings. New modular furniture allows the center to set up various layouts to accommodate different events, Parker said.
However, Wise said more work needs to be done at USC and she wishes the University initiated more of its own projects to create a more accepting culture on campus in addition to supporting existing student-led initiatives.
Despite the new additions, other members of the organizations — including Wise — are pushing for more changes to the cultural centers such as increased space, money for scholarships, additional centers and University support.
Two new lounges — the Native American & Pasifika Student Lounge and the Middle Eastern and North African Student Lounge — opened this semester on the Student Union’s fouth floor and within the CBCSA center, respectively. Maracea Chase, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies, serves as the executive director of NASA. She said the new lounge was established in conjunction with the demand for more representation and resources for Native students at USC.
“One of the things that we did [at the] forefront was to be able to incorporate into a student assembly with [the Undergraduate Student Government],” Chase said. “Thankfully, after that incorporation, that’s when we were told we were going to be getting a space in the Student Union Center, which is not something that we were expecting, but it definitely did happen, for good reason.”
Prior to the Native American student lounge, NASA occupied a room in the University Religious Center. However, Chase said the new student lounge allows her to see other Native students on a day-to-day basis, rather than just during meetings or events.
“I love going into the space and being able to see other people, other Natives, and just catch up, do homework together,” Chase said. 
Wise said the creation of the lounges was crucial for inclusion and hopes for the cultural center to accommodate a growing population of Native American students at USC.
“The lounge that we have is really a big deal because it is a physical representation of how our community is able to take up space, and that space is being made for us at what is a predominantly white institution,” Wise said.
The Middle Eastern and North African Student lounge, located within the CBCSA space, was also a new addition to the USC Student Equity and Inclusion Programs. Anthony Khoory, a junior majoring in sociology, said it’s vital for student populations that are underrepresented to have space where they can come together and express themselves.
“When you have other people from your background … having events where there’s elements of your culture, like food, you feel like USC is your home and not just a place that you’re going to get the degree,” Khoory said.
Khoory began advocating for space and resources for Middle Eastern and North African students in 2019 after questioning the lack of a space for students with Middle Eastern and North African backgrounds.
According to Khoory, he first approached the University’s Director of Cultural Centers in 2019, asking for a space with a full-time staff for Middle Eastern and North African students. 
The result of Khoory’s advocacy was the creation of the Middle Eastern and North African lounge, which opened in Fall 2021 on the first floor of the Student Union. Despite the new space, Khoory said giving the students the room is not enough.
“The MENA lounge is small,” Khoory said. “When we had an event — our first open house event — it got so full that we had to go into the rest of the CBCSA because it was just so many people. Especially with COVID guidelines, you could barely fit 15 to 20 people in this space, and we have thousands in the college who identify as MENA.”
Khoory said he is still “grateful” for the new lounge space and that people are using it.
“There’s midterms, you just want a place to hang out and drink Arabic coffee and eat baklava,” he said.
The Asian Pacific American Student Services lounge is another space that was remodeled over the summer. Kelvin Nguyen, a junior majoring in health and human sciences, said the newly revamped APASS lounge was a place he could safely and conveniently relax, especially as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and living off-campus made it difficult to find a location to relax or charge electronics.
“This place is really useful for me to actually just sit down and do my work without worrying about where I have to go,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen said, before he started going to APASS, he struggled to find work spaces elsewhere on campus. 
“If you want to rent a room at one of the libraries, you have to book it in advance,” Nguyen said. “It’s really awkward if you don’t even know what you’re doing this week.”
Unlike other centers remodeled over the summer, La CASA’s physical space was renovated three years ago. Located in the Student Union, the name was changed from “El Centro Chicano” to the Latinx/Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs — “La CASA” — in 2019.
For Abraham Flores, a freshman majoring in journalism, La CASA has “always been a home.” In the La CASA lounge, murals, including illustrations of prominent Latinx figures, painted by Latinx artists cover the walls. But one particular mural stands out to Flores because it makes him feel connected to his relationship with his parents.
“There’s a mural on the wall, and it’s like a hole in the roof [with] monarch butterflies escaping,” Flores said. “Monarch butterflies are really important in, at least, my culture because they migrate to try to give their children, who are unborn at the time, a better life, and sometimes they don’t make it all the way to their destination. That’s the story of the monarch butterfly. It’s incredible and the fact that it’s a little thing there, it’s really nice.”
According to the students, other cultural centers also hope to install new decorations like La CASA’s murals. 
At CBCSA, Parker said the center plans to maximize the use of its space by collaborating with other cultural centers.
“We’re really looking at college students with multiple identities, and so we’re making sure we touch base with those, too, in collaboration with our other cultural centers,” Parker said.
At NASA’s student lounge, students hope to see continuous expansion, to include as many communities on campus as possible. 
“Hopefully, sometime in the future, we will have the space decorated, both with local tribes and the tribes of our students,” Chase said. “That will be an amazing space to hold future events to celebrate representation and facilitate conversations about how to support Native students more.”
Wise said, while the new spaces are a “big deal,” she hopes the University will make an effort to support minority students beyond the expansion and remodeling of the on-campus cultural centers.
“It’s not perfect. There’s still so much work to be done,” Wise said. “It’s a shame that it has to be put up on the students. I think a lot of the cultural centers need a lot more support in that way — especially the newer ones, and it’s just a first step, so I really look forward to seeing what else comes about.”

After getting all four of her wisdom teeth removed, Faith Nguyen went down to her basement and spent the next three days filming a video explaining string theory. Although she felt “miserable” from “every negative side effect” of the medicine she’d received after surgery, Nguyen pushed through the pain and finished her project in time to submit it to the 2021 Breakthrough Junior Challenge. 
At the time, Nguyen was a high school senior living in Pittsburgh, Pa. Now a freshman at USC majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, Nguyen became one of the 16 remaining Breakthrough Junior finalists in November.
The Breakthrough Junior Challenge is a global annual competition in which students between the ages of 13 to 18 submit a three minute video on a concept or theory in the life sciences, physics or mathematics. The winner receives a $250,000 scholarship for college and a $50,000 prize for the teacher who inspired them. The winner’s high school is also eligible to receive a $100,000 breakthrough science lab designed by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 
This year, the challenge attracted more than 3,400 applicants. Each submission underwent a mandatory peer review and an evaluation from a panel of judges, which narrowed down the contestant pool to 30 semifinalists. 
Nguyen researched, wrote, filmed, edited and animated the entire video by herself during quarantine. Nguyen chose to cover string theory because she found the topic interesting and wanted to make the subject more accessible for younger audiences.
“How I thought of it was: String theory is something I’ve heard of before, but I feel like it’s a science topic that everyone kind of knows about very vaguely but can’t explain what it is. I thought it’d be interesting to learn something alongside the audience,” Nguyen said. “Quantum physics, specifically, is a very interesting topic. I’m not a scientist by any means, but I think that it’s very interesting how there’s this whole other world that’s super microscopic and small.” 
Once Khan Academy and the Breakthrough Prize organization named Nguyen as one of the semifinalists, one of her high school teachers, David Morris, made arrangements to promote her video in the school newspaper. Morris encouraged members of the community to vote for her submission on the Breakthrough Facebook page to increase Nguyen’s chances of passing onto the next round as a finalist. 
Morris has served as Nguyen’s mentor for the past two and a half years. The two met when Nguyen enrolled as a student in Morris’s film production course where Morris said he could tell Nguyen had a gift “right away.” 
“There was just a spark in her eye,” Morris said. “She arrived to our high school TV studio already [a] fully-formed [filmmaker] with videos that she’d already made and visions for videos that she wanted to make.”
The more he got to know Nguyen, the more Morris grew to respect her as an artist. Although he said he doesn’t normally let students loan out his equipment, he began letting Nguyen borrow lights, gimbals, tripods and microphones until she graduated. 
“She’s just driven to push her skill set. It’s just such a rare thing, and I’m not sure how teachable it is,” Morris said. “She knew she was good, and she knew she was smart, but she wanted to be better, and she wanted to be smarter. At the same time, [she’s a] very, very humble kid. I mean, she would be the first to criticize her own work.”
Nguyen said her mother, Grace Nah, is another huge source of support and inspiration. Although Nah said she initially had reservations about Nguyen pursuing a career in film, by the time her daughter was about to finish high school, she “knew it was where her passion was” and wanted her to “go for it.” 
“I’d say, [Faith] was always very much of a storyteller,” Nah said. “She was the one who was off in the corner, putting on little plays with her dolls and things like that, so we always knew she had this really, really creative side to her.”
Nah originally told Nguyen about the competition. When Nah found out that her daughter was a finalist, she said it felt deeply “gratifying.” 
“She’s very single-minded when she wants to get something done, and she pulled it off,” Nah said. “We were extremely proud.” 
The 16 finalist videos are currently set for review by all 13 members of the challenge’s Selection Committee, which consists of figures such as Sal Khan, the founder and CEO of Khan Academy, former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Terence Tao, UCLA professor and Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics laureate. The Breakthrough Prize will announce the winner of the challenge by the end of November.

This week’s edition of “Skyler on Sports” is all about basketball. Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors surpassed Ray Allen’s career mark in 3-pointers to officially end the debate of who is the greatest shooter of all time. Meanwhile, the men’s and women’s basketball teams at USC both opened their seasons hotter than ever, with both teams registering 40-point blowouts.
Steph Curry proves he’s the greatest shooter in NBA history
Even if we all already knew, point guard Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter in NBA history. He became the NBA’s all-time leader in 3-point shots by making the 3,359th 3-pointer of his career Friday. Curry did it at 33 years old, five years earlier than when Allen drained the final 3-pointer of his career at 38 years old. 
Curry also hit one of the most iconic shots in NBA history during this game. He saw a fan pointing at him, and he was so confident his shot would go in that he made time to turn around and point back at the fan, essentially saying, “this one’s for you,” all before his shot swished through the net.
NBA circles are already calling the picture of Curry pointing at a fan one of the most iconic in NBA history. The greatest shooter of all-time shot 9 of 17 from downtown on the night. 
Curry is in a league of his own when it comes to 3-point shooting, as he single-handedly revolutionized the game — for better or worse in the opinion of some — to include 3-point shots as a regular part of a player’s repertoire. For context, Curry has 36 games with at least 9 3-pointers while the next five closest players have combined for 34 total.
This list includes other NBA stars such as guards James Harden, Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson. Some other honorable mentions for the greatest-shooter title are Allen and shooting guard Reggie Miller who both made their marks on the league with their long-range shooting. But when you consider the level of greatness on this list and that Curry surpassed them all when it comes to hot 3-point shooting streaks, it’s clear that Curry is the greatest shooter in NBA history.
Men’s basketball proves they can go even further this year
USC began its season hotter than the Southern California sun, as they put an absolute beatdown on California State University, Northridge in a 40-point blowout victory Nov. 9. at the Galen Center.
The Trojans are coming off an Elite Eight appearance last year in the and look to improve on that this year. There is a giant Evan Mobley-sized hole in the roster, but other scoring options are showing up. Guard Boogie Ellis showed off his scoring prowess, forward Isaiah Mobley beat most of his season averages from last year while showing off improvement in his scoring from all over the floor, and guard Drew Peterson looks like a potential X-factor with a smooth mid-range jumper that led to 14 points on opening night. The Trojans seem to have retained and maybe even built upon their stellar chemistry from last year.
USC also held CSUN to just 32.8% shooting and outrebounded them 40-25 with a promising frontcourt of Mobley and forward Chevez Goodwin. If USC can keep this defensive solidity up and the three-headed monster of Ellis, Mobley and Peterson continues to perform throughout the season, then there’s no reason to doubt that this team can go further than last year’s and maybe all the way. USC has always been a football school, but after the success of last year and the promise of this year, it looks as though the men’s basketball team could be the most exciting men’s team on campus.
Women’s basketball shows its dominance under new Head Coach
When Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb came over to USC from her role as an assistant coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, one of only 15 women to hold such a position in NBA history, it became clear that women’s basketball was about to reach a new level of competitiveness. However, I’m not sure anyone could have predicted that they would reach the level of giving out a 40-point beatdown in their season debut against Hawaii. They also got a gritty road win over the weekend against Virginia.
Graduate student forward Jordan Sanders led the way with 17 points on 5 of 10 shooting. She also couldn’t miss from 3-point range, as she went 3 of 3 from deep. Freshman guard/forward Rayah Marshall went 5 of 10 from the field in her debut for the Trojans while scoring 15 points. After beating Virginia on Sunday behind 13 from Sanders and 16 from Marshall on 8-of-14 shooting, it seems clear that the team has greatly improved from last year.
The main reason for this newfound success is that they have Gottlieb at the helm to create a winning culture for a team filled with talent. Once junior forward Alissa Pili finds her groove, this team should be nearly unstoppable and ready to compete for a spot in the NCAA tournament, where they’ll have a chance to prove themselves amongst the highest level of competition.
Women’s basketball’s success only further enhances the notion that USC may be a basketball school this year, and there’s a lot of excitement around both programs at the moment.

This past weekend, USC traveled north for its final two away matches of the season against Oregon and Oregon State. The Trojans finished their road trip Sunday with a split record of 1-1 after defeating Oregon State, bringing their overall record to 11-14 and conference record to 7-9 on the season.
The Trojans took on the Ducks in the Matthew Knight Arena in their second meeting of the season Friday. Oregon took the first two sets of the match as USC struggled to find its rhythm.
After a few minor changes in the lineup, USC found its groove and was able to take the next two sets of the match. The Trojans looked to pull off a reverse sweep, similar to what the Ducks did in Galen Center in their first meeting, but they fell into a five-point deficit early into the tie-breaking set and were fighting to catch up for the remainder of the set. Oregon claimed the final point, ending the comeback and winning the match 3-2. (25-22, 25-20, 26-28, 21-25, 15-11)
“I thought they came out really strong in the first two sets, and we were still trying to find our way,” Head Coach Brad Keller said. “I think we found our rhythm in the third and fourth set and started playing with a lot of aggression both from the service line and from the transition side of things. In the fifth set, we fell behind pretty early and didn’t match their energy.”
After the defeat, the Trojans were able to bounce back in Sunday’s match against Oregon State. Coming out strong with a big swing from graduate student middle blocker Candice Denny, USC started the match with a high intensity.
The Trojans kept the pressure on the Beavers with graduate student outside hitter Brooke Botkin leading at the net with 14 kills and Denny following with 10 kills. Junior opposite hitter Emilia Weske and outsider hitter Kalen Owes along with graduate student middle blocker Sabrina Smith each totaled 7 kills for the match. With an average hitting percentage of .376 for the match, the Trojans swept Oregon State, ending the match 3-0. (25-13, 25-17, 25-17)
“We left a lot of points and opportunities on the table against Oregon, and then coming in, I just thought that we didn’t do that against Oregon State, which is great,” Keller said. “Our level of execution, point-by-point, play-by-play was at a pretty high level right out of the gates and we just never let up.” 
USC has four games remaining in its regular season and needs to win all of its remaining games to have a shot at qualifying for the playoffs.
“I think we’re running out of rope,” Keller said. “We’re at the end of this journey and we have to win out to have playoff aspirations, and I think that’s a real thing for this team. At the end of the day, it’s been the same story since day one. We have the ability to play at a high level, it’s just how long are we going on those streaks, highs versus lows.”
USC will be back at Galen Center to host Arizona Friday in their second matchup against the Wildcats this season. First serve starts at 8 p.m.

“An Evening With Silk Sonic” marks a momentous occasion. In a year filled with highly-anticipated releases, Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak added their names to the slate as newly-formed duo, Silk Sonic. The album marks Mars’ first album since 2016’s Grammy Award-winning record “24K Magic” and Paak’s newest release after “Ventura.” Needless to say, anticipation has reached a boiling point for the artists’ joint project “An Evening With Silk Sonic.”
Lead single “Leave The Door Open” was released on March 5, 2021 to much fanfare. Since the album’s release, it has garnered over 600 million Spotify streams and peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two non-consecutive weeks. Its lyrical content is casual as Mars and Paak preen over a romantic interest, enticing them to a night in. All of this is layered over a sparkly, all encompassing and soft instrumental that cushions and supports their outstanding vocals. “An Evening With Silk Sonic’s” second single “Skate” achieved, comparatively, moderate success, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 in Aug. 2021, but remained consistent in its old-school sound and tumultuous relationship lyrical themes. 
What works so well about Silk Sonic is Mars and Paak’s chemistry. Their history extends beyond just recording the album. They first met and worked together on the European leg of Mars’ “24K Magic” Tour in 2017. Coincidentally, the idea for a collaboration sprouted out of the tour and blossomed into a 31-minute, nine-song album that will certainly be in contention for Album of the Year come the 2023 Grammy Awards ceremony. 
“An Evening With Silk Sonic” is the perfect blend between Paak’s groovy, rap-infused swagger and Mars’ smooth crooning. “Silk Sonic Intro,” released as a promotional single, sets the perfect tone for the rest of the album. It introduces listeners to host Bootsy Collins and the consistent, old-school sound that’s now characteristic of Silk Sonic, who remain remarkably cohesive throughout the project. 
Early album standout, “Fly As Me,” is reminiscent of Paak’s 2018 “Oxnard.” Here, Mars’ larger audience gets introduced to Paak’s rapping, a facet appreciated and adored by his fanbase, but not highlighted on any of the singles. “Fly As Me” immediately inhabits an infectious groove and never strays away. Mars is mostly absent, participating in just the choruses, but it’s hardly noticeable. Paak holds his own and their seamless performance is given plenty of time to shine through the remaining tracks. 
“After Last Night” brings back the narration of Bootsy Collins which punctuates this smooth, slow, sexy jam. However, its biggest pitfall is uplifting but incredibly corny lyrics. “That gushy gushy good girl,” and “Sweet, sticky, thick and pretty,” are only partly masked by Silk Sonic’s vocal performance and D’Mile’s production. Nonetheless, it’s ethereal and certainly an album highlight.
The third and final single from the album, “Smokin Out The Window,” picks the album’s tempo back up. It recently went viral on TikTok just mere days after its release with the help of Mars’ iconic “this bitch got me payin’ her rent, payin’ for trips” line. Its success organically built hype for the album, further highlighting TikTok’s ability to catapult songs into the mainstream. “Smokin Out The Window’s” lyrical content changes tack from the rest of the album. While Mars and Paak confront a cheating love interest, the new relationship bliss of the first four tracks disappears as they frustratedly reflect, “Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me / But I was wrong (I was wrong) / ‘Cause she belong to everybody.” 
Silk Sonic never misses a chance to flex their wealth either. It’s never more apparent than on “777,” their foray into Las Vegas as a rebound from the devastation brought on the cheater. “And slide to the dealership in the mornin’ / Papa need a brand new foreign,” Paak delivers in staccato fashion, never interrupting the standout track’s relentless flow. 
Sadly, album closer “Blast Off” is one of the weakest tracks, though the bar was set very high. Paak is entirely absent and this, coupled with the slower, psychedelic sound, lacks the energy of both the up and downtempo songs found earlier in the tracklist. Regardless, “An Evening With Silk Sonic” is a must listen, though you’ll have to wrestle your friends for aux over “Red (Taylor’s Version).”

TWICE’s blissful, energy-filled third Korean studio album, “Formula of Love: O+T=<3,” exemplifies not only their generosity to their fans but that they have found the near-perfect formula to a solid K-pop release.
2021 was an eventful year for the nation’s girl group, with TWICE releasing their 10th extended play, their third Japanese album and their first-ever English single in an attempt to breakthrough in the United States. The group is far from done, showcasing their ability to delve into a more mature pop sound and present their chemistry as a group on “Formula of Love: O+T=<3.”
As suggested by the title, the album focuses on love. A sequel to their cutesy 2018 hit, “What is Love?,” the nine-person group is now women in STEM finding the formula to answer the question through pop extravaganza. 
The single “Scientist” is one with a slow start that eventually elevates into the hyper TWICE that many know and love. Accompanied by the catchy lyrics, the STEM queens teach their fans not to overthink their feelings because the real formula of love is in the heart: “Love ain’t a science, don’t need no license / The more you sit there thinking, it’s a minus.”
Continuing the bliss, a balance of dance-heavy and calm tracks create a cohesive K-pop album that sounds neither monotonous nor overly-draining. The English B-side track “Moonlight” is another dance hit with ‘70s-inspired instrumentals, sure to make their fans wish they were in love. 
Setting the tone for the rest of the album, “Moonlight” transitions perfectly into other disco tracks, the catchiest and most danceable being “F.I.L.A. (Fall In Love Again).” In an era where nostalgia is making its comeback, TWICE weaves together sounds of the past with lyrics that make us hopeful for our romantic future.
The softer tracks on the album balance the disco-inspired ones to immerse listeners into the journey and make them understand the formula of love — even if it means having to take them through the hardships as well. The album begins the detour with the breakup song “Rewind,” which reminisces on past relationships that the girls are attempting to forget: “I’m doing fine like you said / The dream I’ve been longing for has come true / I’m not curious about you.”
“Cactus” presents a similar struggle through love as TWICE attempts to overcome the pain and move on with their lives. In the midst of breakup songs, it becomes clear that TWICE’s definition of love isn’t only cheeriness but relies on self-reflection and pain to grow from the past.
The highlights of their third album are the three tracks that divide the nine-person group into trios, showcasing their individual talents. “Push & Pull” groups Jihyo, Sana and Dahyun, where we see Jihyo’s abilities as a star vocalist, Dahyun’s rap adding a special touch to every TWICE hit and Sana shining as both a rapper and vocalist. 
The most experimental of the three tracks, “Hello,” joins Nayeon, Momo and Chaeyoung in a hip-hop collaboration where all three members showcase their ability to ride over a beat. While not the most impactful track on the album, TWICE is able to step out of  their comfort zone to go beyond their adorable, wholesome image and create a song unlike the rest of their discography.
Wrapping up the album with a Korean translation of their first English single, “The Feels” is a staple in TWICE’s discography that sounds perfect in any language. Catchy lyrics and their charisma make it clear why the song deserves the TikTok success it has received. 
“Formula of Love: O+T=<3” ultimately finds its strengths in adding new elements to the TWICE sound including their ability to produce songs in other languages and incorporate aspects of nostalgia by leaning into the disco comeback of the current decade. 
With their third album, TWICE manages to teach listeners what no education system is able to teach — love. From the love songs that fans know the group for, to ballads and breakup hits, they find the formula to not only their area of expertise — love — but a solid K-pop album. The album alone would warrant the group a four out of five on RateMyProfessor if they were to teach a real course on the “Formula of Love.”

On Nov. 2, Gucci debuted their new collection inspired by Los Angeles, Hollywood and the cultural mecca where the runway occurred — the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Let me tell you, the collection was to die for. The silk suits, underwear-as-outerwear layered bustiers and sensual cuts, low cut feather and bead trimmed dresses and crystal cat-eye sunglasses were perfect and exactly the Gucci I have been missing the past few years. 
But, Gucci’s global makeup consultant Thomas de Kluyver stole the show. Keeping the makeup unique and representational of old Hollywood, he also added a few hand-painted hearts to the cheeks of some models. Of course, the hearts were emblematic of classic Hollywood and beauty marks, but I immediately thought of my middle school electra-pop idol: Marina Diamandis of MARINA. 
She rocked the heart beauty mark design predominantly during her “Electra Heart” album era but really honed this trademark look for her song “How To Be a Heartbreaker,” her lyrics literally stating, “rule number three / wear your heart on your cheek / but never on your sleeve / unless you want to taste defeat.”
This poppy, girl-power album exploring emotions of love, loss, self reflection and utmost confidence only played more into Diamandis’ alter ego, Electra Heart, who adorned these babydoll outfits and heart beauty marks. Her next album, “FROOT,” shed this alter ego and blossomed into the MARINA that we know now, but my sixth grade self will never forget Electra Heart for one simple reason: She turned me into a self-proclaimed maneater. 
Of course, part of this internal identification of being a maneater comes from Nelly Furtado’s song, literally titled “Maneater,” and Lucy Liu strutting to Heart’s “Barracuda” in the 2000’s film “Charlie’s Angels.” But growing up in Tokyo at an all-girls Catholic school, where people would constantly remind me that I will never be equal to or better than my male counterparts, the strong female figures there inevitably taught me and my peers that we can be whoever we want to be. Of course, being a snotty sixth grader stressed over grades and sports and music, I decided I would take in this mindset to what was the most available: my petty middle school relationships. 
However, as I grew older and started to gain more experience working in the fashion industry, I’ve been able to find success with this approach of demanding recognition and challenging norms. I can be equal to men if I would like, and there is nothing wrong with being in a position above them. But when incorporating this into my romantic endeavors, it seems to have had an opposite effect. 
Scared that being a self-proclaimed maneater has taken a negative toll on those I eventually wanted to be more than friends with, I attempted to adopt more of a man-repeller-Leandra Cohen-esq approach: Just be you and other people can figure out whether they’re into you or not. Obviously, as a people-pleasing, high strung individual, this approach didn’t stick. 
So every year as cuffing season rolls around, a time when people start committing to cuddling up and dating during the winter, I start to rethink myself and my identity as a woman. Should I be more feminine? Should I be kinder? Should I dumb down my personal jargon and soften my competitive nature? Should I imply more instead of being direct?
On one hand, yes, I dream of becoming that mysterious girl who has lipstick stains on coffee cups and wears dainty gold jewelry with oversized pantsuits and a faded vintage creme tote bag in lieu of a backpack. But at the same time, I love being who I’ve become — spontaneous, still high strung but intelligent, capable and self sufficient. 
Therefore, this year I call for people to prioritize themselves in cuffing season. I, too, have come a long way in my journey of self acceptance, but falling in love with myself has been one of the best decisions I have made. Screw cuffing season: You don’t need it! All you need is yourself, some warm socks and a warm cup of coffee in your hand. 
You’re gorgeous, babes. Don’t forget that.

Country music is arguably the most hated music genre out there. The most faithful listeners even have a hard time listening to the pop-like tunes coming out of Nashville nowadays. 
Country music was created by Black people and European immigrants in the 17th century, and it slowly branched out into different subgenres. Country songs used to stand up against the status quo, like Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “Sixteen Tons,” a moody ballad about greedy coal barons, and Loretta Lynn’s “The Pill,” a song promoting the use of birth control pills. However, after the events of Sept. 11, country music got progressively whiter and more patriotic, though that “patriotism” often borders on outright nationalism.
The good news is that a handful of country and Americana music artists are bringing country music back to its diverse, working-class roots. Here are just a few:
Charley Crockett
Charley Crockett, who is of Black, Cajun, Creole and Jewish heritage, spent his formative years in a Texas trailer park before becoming a globetrotter, playing in every possible venue from the streets of New Orleans to the New York subways. His complex identity translates into the different themes his music covers. For someone who released 10 albums in just a mere six years, there’s no telling what the best-dressed man in country music is going to sing next. 
In his 2020 album “Welcome to Hard Times,” Crockett hits on everything, from chain gangs in his soulful rendition of “Blackjack County Chains,” to our economically and politically rigged world in the album’s titular track. 
Tyler Childers
Tyler Childers is about as authentically Appalachian as you can get, and this son of Kentucky is perhaps one of our time’s greatest storytellers. You can just hear the songs’ emotion and authenticity that retell his first-hand experience as an Appalachian. 
Most recently, Childers made it clear that he isn’t afraid to use his music to push back against so-called Southern values. In his album “Long Violent History,” he initially graced listeners with fiddle tunes before catching them off guard with the album’s last song — its title track. 
In “Long Violent History,” Childers asks white Southerners — and others who have shown disdain for the Black Lives Matter movement — how they would feel if “the smallest interaction with a public servant” could lead to assault or death. Furthermore, Childers gives listeners a history lesson, vividly describing the Battle of Blair Mountain, where coal miners took up arms against strikebreakers, lawmen and eventually the United States Army in the largest labor uprising since the Civil War.
Sturgill Simpson
In his Saturday Night Live debut, Sturgill Simpson was first introduced to the average American audience when his energetic “Call to Arms” almost threatened to blow down the studio. Perhaps one of his most politically and socially critical songs to date, “Call to Arms” is a rockabilly critique of the military-industrial complex — Simpson posits it as more courageous to resist military recruitment propaganda than to be a military puppet.
Orville Peck
The masked baritone from Canada is perhaps the best retort to a socially conservative genre. If his country-bumpkin version of Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” doesn’t embody outlaw country, I don’t know what does.
He performs western ballads and moody country so well, it is hard to imagine country music without his hits such as “Dead of Night,” “Queen of the Rodeo” and “No Glory in the West.” Orville also isn’t the least bit afraid to bring different cultural spheres into his work: He covered the country classic “Jackson” with drag star Trixie Mattel on her EP, “Full Coverage, Vol. 1.”
Brandi Carlile
Brandi Carlile’s music expands many genres, but her country roots are undeniable. She was influenced by country legends such as Patsy Cline and Tanya Tucker and managed to mold the genre to accurately represent and resonate with a larger audience. 
Her song, “The Joke,” is a strong empowerment anthem in and of itself, but it also reflects on everything from sexual orientation to the refugee experience. “Party of One’’ and “Crowded Table” from her all-women country supergroup, The Highwomen, are also worth a listen.
Yola
Yolanda Quartey, also known as “Yola,” actually grew up in Bristol, England. Still, you wouldn’t be able to tell just through her music. Just close your eyes and listen to “Walk Through Fire” or more soulful songs such as “Starlight,” “Diamond Studded Shoes” and “Hold On” and you’ll think that you’re listening to the second coming of Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin — two artists who either left a footprint on country music or found inspiration from it.
Yola reminds us that country isn’t a genre restricted to a region, country or nationality. It is a genre founded by folks from all walks of life singing about their lives.

After over a decade of staying silent in the Supreme Court, the gun control debate has returned. The 2008 landmark case District of Columbia v. Heller was the last time the Supreme Court specified the Second Amendment’s meaning. In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled in favor of a broader definition for the Second Amendment, which “guarantees an individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.” 
As stated by Time Magazine, the case “changed a nearly 70-year precedent set by [United States v. Miller] in 1939.” The decision followed the collective rights theory, which refers to the Second Amendment as a state’s right to defend itself rather than an individual right. While the case broadened gun ownership rights, it still left room for state gun regulations. However, with the issue back and in the hands of a more conservative court, we should be concerned.
On Nov. 3 in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. argued the constitutionality of New York’s concealed firearm law, which requires “proper cause” for self-protection to obtain a concealed firearm license. 
The NYSRPA and other right-to-carry law proponents argue that the New York legislature infringes on their Second Amendment right. Because of the Constitution’s majestic generality and the document’s ingrained gun ownership statutes, the law’s constitutionality has no right answer. But, when we look at our stakes, the right answer exists: prioritizing the safety and livelihood of the public. 
In California, county sheriffs have jurisdiction over who can obtain a concealed carry permit with the need to self-protect, similar to the New York law. However, simply citing fear of crime isn’t an approved reason to obtain a concealed carry permit. 
Over the past few years, California has done a suitable job in passing numerous restrictions on firearms. With a Gifford Rating of an A and a firearm death rate of 7.8%, California is a prime example of the strong positive correlation between strict state gun laws and lower overall firearm fatality rates. 
However, gun violence is a multifaceted problem, and with limited direct measures of gun prevalence, researchers cannot fully assess the relationship between firearm prevalence and violent crime on a nationwide scale. Various studies conducted by RAND Corporation have found limited or inconclusive evidence of a relationship between stronger study designs and improved survey data on gun ownership and use. 
However, by using a synthetic control approach combined with decades of crime data, Stanford Law Professor John Donohue found evidence that “strongly confirms that [right-to-carry] laws are associated with 13 to 15% higher aggregate violent crime rates 10 years after adoption.” In his study, he further states, “There is not even the slightest hint in the data that [right-to-carry] laws reduce overall violent crime.” Donohue’s research further confirms that in considering the pros and cons of right-to-carry laws, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. 
Everytown Research & Policy defines right-to-carry laws as laws that allow gun owners to “carry a concealed gun in public with no permit and no training.” Many argue that these laws allow self-protection and provide a solution to high rates of violent crimes. 
However, as Donohue’s study showed, these laws do nothing to create safe streets and inadequately protect gun owners, completely undermining public safety. If anything, carrying a concealed firearm increases fatality rates. Research conducted by Everytown Research & Policy shows the same trends: “States that have passed permitless carry legislation [experienced] a substantial increase in gun violence.” 
A study by the Harvard School of Public Health further shows that “most purported self-defense gun uses are gun uses in escalating arguments” and “firearms are used far more often to intimidate than in self-defense.”
Even if the Supreme Court were to apply strict scrutiny — which the First Amendment Encyclopedia defines as “the highest form of review courts use to evaluate the constitutionality of laws” — the New York concealed carry law still survives. When considering all the aforementioned research, the government has compelling reasons to enact gun regulation laws. 
Furthermore, in his dissent to Heller, Justice Paul Stevens wrote, “While [the Second Amendment] empowered Congress to organize, arm, and discipline the militia, it did not prevent Congress from providing for the militia’s disarmament.” In other words, the Second Amendment does not justify an unlimited right to bear arms.
Point blank: there is no need for concealed carry. The goal is not to infringe upon anyone’s fundamental rights rather it is to create safer communities with lower rates of violent crimes through gun safety laws. 
The Justices have until June — the end of the court’s term — to make a decision. With its decision setting the precedent for all current and future gun regulations, the Supreme Court could set unimaginable consequences in motion.
