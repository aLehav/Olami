Unsatisfied with mainstream dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, Leor Massachi and Daniel Newman, both seniors majoring in real estate development, decided to take matters into their own hands. Together, they co-founded a live speed dating game in a mobile app called Dandy to create an efficient space for meeting romantic partners.
“Dandy is more of an experience,” Massachi said. “Given the nature of the product, your heart rate actually increases when we go live. College students are by far the most social, spontaneous demographic. We’re always meeting students on campus [and] want to meet new people and this is the most fun and efficient way of making that happen.”
The app, which released an update in August, aims to allow USC students to virtually connect through instant messages, without needing to meet in person. Dandy emulates raw human behavior, as it gives students a convenient way to connect, by addressing issues of unreliability and privacy on current dating apps, Newman said.
With recent updates which help users control the time they spend on devices — like Instagram’s “You’re All Caught Up” feature and Apple’s iOS 12 in-detail reports — the co-founders wanted Dandy to be the most productive three minutes of a user’s day. 
“Dandy is leading this inflection point in social,” Massachi said. “We’ve engineered Dandy to be something exciting you play with your friends for only a couple minutes — then send you back into the real world.”
Upon download, the app presents users with a timer indicating when the next virtual party, or gathering of fellow users, will happen. At the end of the countdown, all participants receive a push notification to join the party and are presented with a photo of another male or female once the app goes live. If the two users “like” one another within five seconds, they progress into a two-minute chat through instant messaging. If both parties still “like” each other after the quick chat, their phone numbers will be unlocked, opening the potential for further communication. Part of the fun of app is that these live parties occur randomly and with no set schedule. 
“This entire party lasts for only a couple minutes, so don’t be surprised if your heart rate goes up as you experience Dandy go live,” Newman said. 
Unlike most dating networks, Dandy is secured within certain communities. The app requires users to provide a university email address and Instagram handle. Given this extra precaution, users are free to talk in a safe and verified circle among fellow USC students. 
In addition to being productive and secure, the team behind the app wanted the game to be inclusive to all university students and create a sense of community, Dandy Chief Marketing Officer Ashley Pakzaban said. 
“With Dandy, students are able to network and find cute people in a great atmosphere without having to deal with hoards of people at a frat party or a super exclusive little event,” Pakzaban said. “Dandy makes life easy by connecting you with the people in your community in a faster, safer and [more] fun way.” 
According to Dandy Chief Growth Officer Daniel Aghachi, the team hopes that the app will provide students with an opportunity to eventually establish genuine, real-life connections with others, making their time at the university more enjoyable. 
“We hope that USC students will get real in-person interactions with other students because of the spontaneous factor of Dandy,” Aghachi said. “Students across the nation are spending way too much time on social media which disables them from establishing genuine, real connections with others. With Dandy, all students will look forward to Dandy going live, whether it be every day or once every week.”

Ainsley Carry, the vice president of Student Affairs, hosted the event with Student Health Services. The talk was meant to provide a space for students to ask questions on a broad range of topics. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With a small crowd of fewer than 20 people, Student Health Services and the Division of Student Affairs hosted its first “Student Conversation” to discuss campus-wide concerns Thursday evening. 
University leaders from the Engemann Student Health Center and the University administration addressed suicide awareness, sexual harassment on campus, the proposed restructuring of the Engemann Student Health Center and the addition of new student services. 
“One of the things that we realized from this summer and with my involvement with meeting student government is that we really have this opportunity to sit down and to just have a ‘powwow’ to talk about what’s going on, what’s working, what’s not working and to hear your advice,” Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said. “We’re not reacting to a crisis right now, but there are always things that the administration should be spending time to listen to students and to talk with students.” 
Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman elaborated on the letter sent on Aug. 20 discussing changes to the health center. She said that in order to enhance the mental health department and allow more students to receive help, the center will hire 10 therapists this year, and two more for the next academic year.
Executive Director of Counseling and Mental Health Services Robert Mendola spoke about the creation of the “Let’s Talk” program, which aims to help students who do not feel comfortable reaching out to the health center for help with mental health. The program will allow therapists to come to students.
“‘Let’s Talk’ is really opening the door to one-on-one communication around building report for care,” Mendola said. 
Van Orman added that the health center hopes to break the language and cultural barrier with students, following allegations that former gynecologist George Tyndall targeted international students who had limited knowledge of medical practices.
“One of the things we’ve worked on is developing a guide for students that was translated by the Chinese Student Scholar Association,” Van Orman said. “We’re also working with some of our educational materials [where] I spent a lot of time thinking about how to communicate with students about sensitive health exams and to communicate what’s normal during those exams [and] what’s not … and that is actually being translated into Chinese and Korean.”
Another segment of the forum discussed the suicide of a resident assistant last spring and how the University is working to prevent this type of situation. One student said that RAs cared for students on their respective floors, but asked who was taking care of the RAs and their mental health.  
Carry responded by saying that training sessions were set in place for RAs to understand their own wellbeing. He added that an RA support group had also been created.
“Being a RA is a tough job,” Carry said. “They’re student leaders, they’re busy, they’re also students. They’re just like every other student in our population, struggling with all of the challenges.”
Two more of these conversations are scheduled to be held at the University Campus Center on Sept. 5 and 11; another one will be at the Health Sciences Campus on Sept. 4.

Aneesha Madhok, who majored in theatre and minored in screenwriting at USC, said she found ways to incorporate her Indian heritage into her work by combining ballet with a traditional Indian dance. (Photo courtesy of Aneesha Madhok)
It is opening weekend for the play “Infidel” at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks, and a USC alumna will be taking center stage.
Aneesha Madhok, who graduated this past spring, will portray the lead female role as the protagonist’s wife. She moved from India in 2014 to study theatre and has always loved acting, even staging her own show called “Aliza Free” back home. The show was set in Israel, and aimed to raise awareness about how visually impaired people are often isolated and excluded from society. It was picked up by almost two dozen newspapers, which Madhok says encouraged her to pursue theatrical arts more seriously.
Madhok, who always wanted to pursue theatre, said she found ways to incorporate her heritage into her work upon arriving at USC. She created her own fusion style of dance that combined traditional ballet with Kathak, a northern Indian style of dance.
“That also really influenced my comedy because a lot of my comedy is about my childhood in India [and] how I, as an Indian, see the world,” Madhok said. “But my education was in a private English school so that’s why I have an American accent -— so all those factors really influenced my art.”
While at USC, Madhok majored in theatre and minored in screenwriting. She was deeply involved with the student production “Love & Information.”  During her senior year, she co-founded the USC Stand-Up Comedy Club.
It didn’t take Madhok long after graduation to land up her role in “Infidel.”
“I heard about this play from a friend and I auditioned for it,” Madhok said. “I really loved my character, Myiesha, because I change the mind of the suicide bomber, Jamil, and win him with my love. I don’t use any seduction, no violence; just pure, spiritual love.”
“Infidel” tells the story of an American anthropologist who is kidnapped by fundamentalists in Baghdad and follows the ensuing struggle between faith and terrorism in the context of Islam and Western imperialism. The thrilling drama is directed by Christopher Vened, who says he was inspired by a video where masked terrorists were smashing ancient religious sculptures. He said he wanted to explore conflicting intersections of religion and culture in “Infidel.”
“Every day we hear about terrorists who kill in the name of God, a concept that is impossible to grasp because most of us see it as a deed of pure evil,” Vened said, in a press release. “Maybe it’s a fantasy, but I wanted to write a play that would humanize these radicals and find a way to liberate them from their fanaticism.”

Alumni Maxine Lau and Qiyuan You wanted to develop an authentic and healthy sauce while providing a healthier option. The sauce is currently being sold at 400 Whole Foods. (Photo courtesy of Maxine Lau)
As an Asian American college student, USC alumna Maxine Lau yearned for authentic hot Chinese dishes that reminded her of home. Unsatisfied with the campus dining halls and nearby restaurants, Lau took matters into her own hands. 
While taking the Venture Initiation course at the USC Marshall School of Business, Lau developed her startup Lahtt Sauce, and met her future business partner Qiyuan You. With the goal of providing healthier food options that resonate with their cultural origins, Lau and You partnered to expand Lahtt Sauce, Chinese-style sauce made with simple ingredients to dip, marinate and stir-fry food.
Last fall, Lahtt Sauce received $2,500 for the Venture Validation award hosted by the USC Stevens Student Innovator Showcase. After selling their sauce on Amazon and less than 40 local stores, Lahtt Sauce expanded its distribution to 400 Whole Foods locations across the nation this August.
After many taste tests and packaging revisions, Lau and You proceeded to pitch Lahtt Sauce to wholesale distributors and online retailers, such as Milk and Eggs and Alhambra Farmers Market. The challenge was finding manufacturers capable of delivering the health and flavor standards Lahtt Sauce promises, as well as encouraging retailers to buy into the vision and potential of the company. 
“We pitch the business first with a great product that meets our standards in quality and taste,”  Lau wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We educate the vendors with the history and versatile use of the product. We’re looking to expand our product line and launch a new product by [quarter one] of next year. We’re looking to continue to grow within the natural channel and boost online sales through Amazon.”
Lahtt Sauce originally featured two flavors: bacon and shrimp, and a vegan sauce with shiitake mushrooms. Along with their market expansion and in order to remain competitive, the company began offering a diverse range of selections for customers — including hot, medium and mild spice levels — as well as two more vegan options. 
“We started out with a lot of trial and error,” Lau said. “Taking Lahtt Sauce from idea to business requires industry knowledge, network and business acumen. Many of these resources and knowledge were obtained and developed from the Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation program at USC.” 
With their company’s success, Lau and You have also noticed that most Asian brands on the market were either “too Americanized” or “unconcerned with health.” To combat this problem, Lahtt Sauce aims to bridge the two extremes for health- and tasted-inclined consumers.
“Lahtt Sauce provides customers a different choice by providing a product that is not only healthy, but also authentic,” You said. “Even consumer are very concerned about health, having a healthy lifestyle and living healthier … and for those who have been to Asia and know how it tastes like … they are our target customers.” 
The company devotes the majority of its efforts and attention to differentiating Lahtt Sauce from similar products on the market. The product is an alternative to Asian sauce brands that contain unhealthy levels of MSG and preservatives. Lahtt Sauce is gluten-free, crafted locally in Southern California and made with natural ingredients free from MSG, preservatives and GMOs. 
In the future, Lahtt Sauce hopes to secure more sponsors and vendors that will bring exposure, volume and sales to the company. Despite fierce competition within the healthy condiment market, the company believes strongly in its mission and ability to reach the palates of more Asian cuisine enthusiasts. 
“I think that consistency is really important and to be believing in what you do … Once you get to the major retailers like Whole Foods or Ralphs, I think that is 90 percent of the success,” You said. “There are a lot of competitors … so you just always have to believe in what you do and don’t give up.”

Yasmin Davis | Daily Trojan
With the release of Troye Sivan’s sophomore album, #20GayTeen is now in full “Bloom.” The aptly-titled record, which came out Friday, has already been lauded as one of the best pop albums of 2018 — and undoubtedly so.
Upon first listen, I found myself awestruck by Sivan’s maturity and transformation. On the opening track “Seventeen,” the gay artist reflects on a relationship with an older man he met on Grindr while underage. It’s a deeply introspective song, one that signals a remarkable departure from the starry-eyed idealism Sivan displayed in his debut LP “Blue Neighbourhood.” And throughout the rest of “Bloom,” Sivan isn’t afraid to be honest about the realities of queer romance, as exemplified by songs such as “Postcard” and “Plum.” While it may seem as if “Bloom” is merely a bold proclamation of Sivan’s sexuality, in reality, it is so much more. 
Leading up to the album’s release, Sivan stated in several interviews that he wanted to create music that honestly depicted his life — as well as the lives of other young people grappling with their sexual identity. That to me is absolutely incredible. 
Troye Sivan is part of a new generation of queer artists changing the face of the music industry. Joining him are Hayley Kiyoko, Kehlani, Kim Petras, Kevin Abstract, Halsey, Olly Alexander and countless others. 
Sure, there have been plenty LGBTQ+ artists who rose to fame in the past — but what sets this group apart from the others? The answer is simple: Their music has an incredible ability to resonate with a generation of young listeners who can empathize with their experiences as queer individuals. 
In many ways, this crop of artists are byproducts of the incredible progress that the LGBTQ+ community and music industry have made over the years. Proudly embracing their identities, these artists are finding their place in music and pop culture through songcraft that is both accessible to the mainstream and deeply rooted in the queer community. 
Though I could continue praising the artists leading this queer pop revolution, it would be remiss of me to not acknowledge all the queer artists who came before them. We had David Bowie, who transformed the way people associate music with self-expression, particularly with regard to sexuality and androgyny, through his alter ego Ziggy Stardust. 
We have Elton John and Freddie Mercury, who pioneered publicization of their sexualities with groundbreaking performance styles. We have RuPaul, who introduced drag performance to the rest of the world with “Supermodel (You Better Work).” And we have Lady Gaga, who brought gay culture to the masses with mega-radio hits and mobilized young people to engage in LGBTQ+ activism. The list goes on and on.
Without their accomplishments, the current generation of artists would not be able to openly share their stories the way they do today. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am extremely grateful to be living in a time when young people can listen to music that accurately represents their lives — and it’s astounding to think that just several years ago, people like me were growing up without artists creating music that reflected their lives, their feelings and their sexual identities. 
Music has always been a medium I could use to help me better understand my emotions, but there has only been a handful of times when I found music or artists that truly resonated with me as a queer individual. 
The first encounter was discovering Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” in eighth grade. It was liberating to hear someone sing about self-love and acceptance on mainstream radio, especially because I had recently undergone a reckoning with my own sexuality. In the years after Lady Gaga’s queer anthem, music about the queer experience devolved to merely appease top-40 listeners. I felt a disconnect from mainstream music celebrating gay culture and identity — until I discovered Troye Sivan, who boldly confronts the realities of queerness in music. 
For the first time in a long time, I felt understood in a way I hadn’t experienced since Lady Gaga. The liberation and freedom she inspired in me was finally replicated again. This feeling — one of boldness, pride and honesty — is one I hope to never stop feeling, and I’m glad that queer artistry is finally reaching the forefront of music.

From the mind of director Lenny Abrahamson, “The Little Stranger” executes suspense through the lens of memory and psychological terror. The film was released in theaters Friday. (Photo courtesy of Focus Features)
“The Little Stranger” is a demanding film. It expects viewers to play by the rules it sets, which mainly involve keeping them, as well as its characters, in the dark up until the very last frame. Where the average thriller would employ dramatic irony to place viewers one step ahead of the characters (think of the “don’t go in there!” shouts that accompany watching a character in a horror film approach their untimely demise), “The Little Stranger” refrains from divulging crucial information unless the characters themselves discover it; the effect is the type of suspense that does not fear what will happen so much as it yearns to make sense of what is happening. Concealing the plot in this way is a double-edged sword; it serves to elevate curiosity and engagement, but can also lose the audience’s attention as it eventually feels like it is going nowhere. 
Despite its shortcomings, “The Little Stranger” is an intelligent work that could only come from equally intelligent creators namely, Sarah Water, who wrote the novel of the same name, and Lenny Abrahamson, director of the 2015 drama “Room.” Abrahamson has proven his affinity for stories that probe the human psyche in his two major works: “Frank” (2014), which peered into the despair accompanying the artistic process, and “Room,” which explored the mental consequences of prolonged oppression that suddenly ends. 
Set in the summer of 1948, “The Little Stranger” tells the story of a British country doctor, Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson), who answers a house call at Hundreds Hall — a dilapidated former palace in the countryside. His subsequent doctoral visits to the hall make him witness to strange patterns of behavior on the part of the resident family, the Ayres (played by Ruth Wilson, Will Poulter and Charlotte Rampling). He mentions early on that he had visited the hall once before, as a child accompanying his mother to her job as a maid; according to Faraday, the house cast a spell on him that day. 
As the plot progresses, Faraday returns to the house constantly, sometimes without an invitation, drawn to it like a magnet. His thoughts rarely veer from Hundreds Hall and the memory of his first visit; its grandeur reawakens the spell it cast on him in his childhood, and its effects grow stronger as the memory replays incessantly. “The Little Stranger” is (among other things) an inquiry into dark memories, how they are repressed, and what happens when such memories are suddenly ignited. 
Rarely detracting from Faraday’s point of view, the film is consistent in its style which perfectly adorns its gloomy subject matter. The mystery of it all is blatantly represented on screen with a dreary silver sheen over almost every frame. Abrahamson also employs his signature extreme close-ups that blur out everything except the character’s face, forcing viewers to examine every single detail of their expression before them and draw conclusions on what is going through their minds at that moment. It’s the perfect touch, given the psychological nature of the story. 
Gleeson, Wilson and Poulter shine in their respective roles: Gleeson is a self-made stoic while Poulter falls on the opposite end of the spectrum as a war-torn drunkard who says whatever he thinks. Wilson’s Caroline operates more subtly, effectively causing the audience to pay closer attention to her side of things. 
The performances are perfectly tuned to the mystery genre, despite IMDb’s claims that it is actually horror. Although purposeful in its techniques, “The Little Stranger” rarely grips its audience with fear; it carries a secret up until the final frame, but — intriguing as this inherently is — fails to truly entice the viewer along the way by leaving out the creeping chills and sudden frights that would command their attention; a hungry modern audience is unlikely to put up with this absence of fear. 
“The Little Stranger” is truly more of a character study than it is a popcorn thriller.  It is also not as enthralling due to a disappointing lack of, well, actual horror. Though a house casting a psychological spell upon a man is certainly an attractive premise, “The Little Stranger” will inevitably have viewers who are not willing to play by its rules of secrecy. Such viewers are likely to feel underwhelmed as the credits begin to roll.

Created by USC senior Simone Zienna, Meta Nutrition is the newest resource to help students achieve their dietary goals. (Photo from Meta Nutrition app)
Senior computer science student Simone Zienna pulled 14-hour work days over winter break and, while at school, begins his day of coding at 10 a.m., which often extends well into the night. The outcome of all his hard work? Meta Nutrition. 
Meta Nutrition, an app focused on health in USC dining halls, is the result of Ziennas two passions: nutrition and software engineering. The app works to help USC students maintain diets that will help them accomplish their fitness goals. Zienna comprehensively developed both iOS and Android versions of Meta Nutrition  branded as Your Personal Nutritionist  in just 11 months, and hes already planning for the future. 
Zienna is a health buff himself. Certified in nutrition, he works as a nutritionist and personal trainer at the Lyon Center. Zienna said he created the app out of his passion for helping students balance their studies and extracurricular activities with nutrition and fitness. 
Ive noticed that people really try, and then many times they just give up because theres so much information thrown at you, Zienna said. Theres all these apps and products out there and they delegate the work to you, theres a bunch of information that you need to make sense out of. I felt that there was a need for somebody to guide people.
Meta Nutrition takes a holistic approach to tailoring dining hall options to the specific needs of students. Fitness goal options include lose weight, gain weight, gain muscle and balanced nutrition. Diet types range from regular, vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free. The app also covers a variety of dietary restrictions, from shellfish to sesame to soy. A users profile consists of any combination of the three dietary categorizations. 
Meta Nutrition pulls online menus from USCs three dining halls websites. That information is stored in a database, which then inputs users restrictions and goals. Everything is run through an algorithm created by Zienna, and comes out in the form of meals that match a users specifications, to a certain extent. 
Zienna explains how in the vegan and vegetarian communities many people still want to go to the gym and gain muscle, but lack adequate nutrition information. Meta Nutrition aims to bridge that gap.
For a vegetarian looking to gain weight, the app suggests a Parkside Restaurant & Grill lunch of assorted fruits, steamed white rice, coriander garbanzo beans, steamed broccoli and sautéed mushrooms as a 100 percent match. An 80 percent match, though, recommends plain pasta, steamed wheat berries and french fries. Zienna admits that the app is not perfect but intends to continue improving its algorithm.
For now, Zienna is working on growing out a team to help expand Meta Nutrition to other college campuses. 
Eventually, I want to expand to restaurants, he said. 
Zienna doesnt only plan to expand externally, but also within the app. 
By next month Im planning on adding the Keto diet, he added. 
While some users may find the app bulky  advertisements clutter the homepage next to sliding images which are resized imperfectly  it gets the job done. Students with fitness goals and dietary restrictions can now learn to eat from the dining halls in ways that complement their daily lives. Most importantly, it has a prominent feedback section, where users can leave comments about the app.

One of the best parts of attending USC is the seemingly endless list of neighborhoods and locales one has at their disposal. USC offers students free Lyft rides within a 2.5 mile-boundary between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. if they sign up with their USC-issued email addresses, a service students have dubbed “Fryft.” Here is a list of local destinations to discover without thinning one’s wallet with transportation costs.
60out Escape Rooms
2284 S. Figueroa St.
1.3 miles
This recreational spot has provided customers with an immersive action-adventure experience for three years. Comprising teams of two to six people, patrons must solve various problems and escape perilous scenarios that are part of an interactive story — all within a time limit. There are about 20 locations in Los Angeles, each with its own unique room and experience. The escape room closest to campus houses the rooms “Flight of the Pandorus,” a science-fiction story, and “The Krampus,” a reference to a Christmastime demon in Central European folklore.
Angelus Rosedale Cemetery
1831 W. Washington Blvd.
1.9 miles
This cemetery takes up 65 acres of land from West Washington to Venice boulevards. It was founded in 1884, when the city had a population of only 28,285. It was the first cemetery in Los Angeles to introduce lawn cemeteries and the second cemetery in the United States to open a crematory (and the first west of the Rocky Mountains). The cemetery will also hold its 28th Annual Living History Tour on Sept. 23, with tours departing from 9 a.m. until noon. This year’s theme is “Dreams Are Made of This: The Immigrant’s Story.”
Doheny Mansion
10 Chester Pl.
1.1 miles
Built by Theodore Eisen and Summer Hunt for the Oliver P. Posey family in 1899, the Doheny Mansion captures the spirit of early Los Angeles. It is located on the downtown campus of Mount Saint Mary’s University and has also served as a filming location for many popular movies like “Catch Me If You Can” and “Spider-Man 3.” For only $20, anyone can catch a close-up glimpse of this mansion by taking a public tour, which includes the home of Ned Doheny at 10 Chester Place. The tour, which is open to the public, lasts about 2.5 hours and only happens a few times a year, so be sure to book a reservation.
The Reef / LA Mart
1933 S. Broadway
1.8 miles
Both The Reef and LA Mart are creative habitats, marketed to appeal to entrepreneurs and innovators. The combination of stores helps entrepreneurs grow their businesses, replete with equipment for podcasting, video studios and event and presentation spaces. The Reef is open to use for creators of any industry, from fashion to media to design, and it promotes social collaboration through experimentation, learning and mentoring. In the same complex is LA Mart, which sells the best gifts, home furniture and lifestyle products in its 500,000-square foot space. This building also holds Maker City LA, which gives businesses creative co-working spaces, and the Magic Box, an exceptional space for holding trade shows and special events.
King Taco
2020 Pico Blvd.
1.7 miles
Of all of Los Angeles’ local culinary gems, King Taco is one of the best. With 20 locations scattered throughout L.A. County, this Mexican restaurant has served the public since it was founded in 1974, when its original space was converted from an ice cream truck. While the establishment is not elaborate in appearance, it more than compensates for it with the quality of its food. With traditional entrees like tacos, quesadillas and burritos, customers are able to choose from a variety of meats such as carne asada, pollo and cabeza. The King Taco closest to campus is a sit-in restaurant, but other locations have outside seating. 
Tam’s Burger
4301 S. Figueroa St. # 67
1.3 miles
Tam’s Burger is the chain that Compton’s own Kendrick Lamar rapped about on his song “ELEMENT.” and is recommended in his personal guide to L.A. with Complex. Much like King Taco, Tam’s Burger is a local joint whose establishments have dilapidated exteriors and high quality food, contributing to the restaurant’s authenticity and character. Founded in 1971, the burger restaurant has over 40 locations across L.A. County, with the nearest being 1.3 miles from USC’s campus. Although this local favorite markets itself as a burger establishment, it has numerous other menu options, including salads, sandwiches, breakfast foods and dessert. “Everybody loves In-N-Out, but it’s a very clean-cut burger,” Lamar told Complex. “Tam’s is street-sloppy, burgers and shakes. It’s a chain, but it’s still [good].”

Senior inside linebacker Cam Smith recorded 112 tackles last season. He has 273 tackles in his USC career. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
No. 15 USC will open up the 2018 football season at home against UNLV Rebels this Saturday. The Rebels come off a 5-7 year under head coach Tony Sanchez, while USC comes off a 11-3 Pac-12 Championship season that ended in a loss to Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. Here’s a breakdown of how the Trojans match up with the Rebels in all three phases of the game. 
Trojan Offense vs. Rebel Defense
UNLV’s defensive unit was a major weakness last year. It ranked an abysmal 113th in the nation in total defense, conceding 458.7 yards per contest. The Rebels’ run defense was particularly suspect, giving up 239.3 yards per game on the ground, placing them at 122nd in the nation. 
That isn’t to say their defense is devoid of talent; senior safety Dalton Baker was impressive last season, racking up a team high 99 tackles, while junior linebacker Gabe McCoy had 80 tackles and forced two fumbles. The Rebels fired their previous defensive coordinator after last season, hiring Tim Skipper during the offseason. It remains to be seen how much the unit changes from last year under Skipper’s direction. The Trojans should have a great opportunity to establish their running game against the Rebels’ lackluster run defense, giving running backs senior Aca’Cedric Ware, sophomore Stephen Carr and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai a chance to get in a good rhythm to start the season. 
In addition, establishing the run will take pressure off freshman quarterback JT Daniels and give him a chance to get going in his first start. If he can have a good game Saturday, it could help establish his confidence for the season.
Trojan Defense vs. Rebel Offense
The Rebels’ offense features the team’s most dangerous facet: a dynamic rushing attack. Dual threat sophomore quarterback Armani Rogers and senior running back Lexington Thomas combined for over 2,000 rushing yards last season, while the talented sophomore speedster Charles Williams (who earned the starting spot last year before getting injured) will make his return. The UNLV ground game, which was ranked 16 in the nation last season, could provide the Trojan front seven — who allowed 158.4 rush yards per game last year — with a serious test in their first game. 
However, the Rebels’ passing offense was anemic last year, averaging 186.9 yards a game with 54 percent completion percentage. Their leading current junior receiver, Brandon Presley, accumulated only 552 yards last season. The Trojan secondary, led by veteran standouts cornerbacks senior Iman Marshall, redshirt senior Ajene Harris and senior safety Marvell Tell III should show out against the Rebels, leaving UNLV little room to get a foothold in the game.
Special Teams
UNLV had a rather lackluster return game last season, with its best kick returner averaging about 22 yards per return and its primary punt returner averaging about 5.8 yards per runback. By contrast, the Trojans will have redshirt sophomore Velus Jones reprise his duties as the primary kickoff returner, a role in which he averaged 24.5 yards per attempt, and freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown will handle punt returns. St. Brown returned punts in high school, where he averaged 19.8 yards per return and scored two touchdowns. Both teams feature solid kickers, with sophomore Chase McGrath returning to USC after converting 70.6 percent of his field goal attempts and UNLV bringing back senior Evan Pantel, who has never missed a field goal under 39 yards and has connected on 83 percent of his total attempts.
The Verdict
The UNLV run game should prove a tough test for the Trojan defense — the beginning of the game could be rather slow, as Daniels gets going and the Rebels try to pound the ball on the ground. However, the Trojan rushing attack should start gashing the UNLV defense and give Daniels the opportunity to start slinging it, breaking the game open. UNLV’s passing attack likely won’t have the firepower to engage in a shootout, especially against a seasoned USC secondary.
